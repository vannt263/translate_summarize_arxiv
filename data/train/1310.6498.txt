    "b2  1215 + 30 , also commonly referred to as on  325 or 1es  1215 + 303 , was first detected in the bologna northern cross telescope survey conducted at 408 mhz .",
    "it was one of the first bl lac - type objects to be identified @xcite and was one member of the small set of objects used to define the class .",
    "the distance to this source is uncertain and two different redshift values , both obtained from spectroscopic measurements , can be found in the literature : z  =  0.130 ( @xcite ; ned ) and z  =  0.237 ( @xcite ; simbad ) .",
    "a 10-minute exposure with the fast instrument on the flwo 60  telescope in 2011 did not yield any obvious emission lines in the continuum spectrum to resolve this discrepancy ( e.  falco , priv .",
    "comm . ) . similarly , no spectral features were evident in a high sn spectrum ( sn 50 - 120 from the red to blue side ) we obtained with the lick observatory kast double spectrograph on the shane 3-m telescope on 13 february 2013 ( mjd 56336 ) .",
    "bl lac objects and flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) belong to the most extreme sub - class of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , named blazars . their relativistic jet is oriented close to the observer s line - of - sight .",
    "they show rapid variability at all wavelengths with the fastest being observed at very high energies ( vhe ; e@xmath0100  gev ) on time scales of minutes @xcite .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of blazars is dominated by non - thermal emission and consists of two distinct , broad components .",
    "the low - energy component ranges from radio to uv / x - rays and is widely believed to be due to synchrotron emission from ultra - relativistic electrons in the jet magnetic field .",
    "to explain the origin of the second component , peaking between x - rays and gamma rays , two fundamentally different scenarios exist , dominated by either leptonic or hadronic emission . in leptonic scenarios ,",
    "the high - energy radiation is produced via inverse - compton scattering of the ultra - relativistic electrons responsible for the synchrotron emission .",
    "possible seed photons are synchrotron photons within the jet ( synchrotron self - compton , ssc model ) , or external photons ( external compton , ec model ) from the disk , the broad line region , or the jet . in hadronic scenarios , protons are accelerated to sufficiently high energies and the high - energy emission is dominated by neutral pion decay as well as hadronic synchrotron radiation .",
    "for a review of different blazar models see @xcite and references therein .    based on its sed ,",
    "b2 1215 + 30 was suggested by as a potential tev source .",
    "it is now classified as a bright intermediate - frequency - peaked bl lac object ( ibl ) based on its synchrotron peak location at @xmath4  hz .",
    "it is listed in the _ fermi _ bright - source list @xcite , and appears in later _",
    "fermi _ catalogs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where it is classified as a high - synchrotron - peaked bl lac ( hsp ) .    in early january 2011",
    ", b2  1215 + 30 was detected in the vhe band by magic during observations triggered by an optical high state @xcite .",
    "the flux above 200  gev was @xmath5 with a photon spectral index of @xmath6 .",
    "in this paper we report on the results of veritas observations taken in the direction of b2  1215 + 30 between december 2008 and may 2012 .",
    "this blazar is in the same field of view as 1es  1218 + 304 , a bright vhe blazar which is regularly observed by veritas @xcite .",
    "a large part of the data presented here originates from observations taken on 1es  1218 + 304 .",
    "veritas is an array of four imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes located in southern arizona .",
    "it is sensitive to gamma - ray energies from 100  gev to about 30  tev and has been fully operational since fall 2007 .",
    "short cherenkov light flashes produced in extensive air showers are focused by 12  m diameter reflectors onto fast - recording cameras . each camera",
    "is equipped with 499 photomultiplier tubes with a total field of view of 3.5 . in summer 2009 ,",
    "one of the four telescopes was moved to a new location .",
    "this yielded about @xmath7 sensitivity improvement and reduced the observation time needed to detect a 1% crab nebula - like source with 5 standard deviations ( @xmath8 ) from 48  hours to less than 30  hours @xcite .",
    "the observations reported here include observations of b2  1215 + 30 and 1es  1218 + 304 , two sources which are separated by 0.76 .",
    "all observations were taken in `` wobble mode '' where the source position is offset by 0.5  from the camera center to allow for simultaneous background estimation . combining the observations on both sources , veritas observed b2  1215 + 30 for more than 93 hours between december 2008 and may 2012 .",
    "the data are divided into three data sets , corresponding to yearly observation epochs .",
    "the first one spans 34 hours from december 2008 to may 2009 at a mean zenith angle of 20 , the second data set was recorded between january and june 2011 ( 42 hours ) at a mean zenith angle of 15 , and the third data set was taken from january to may 2012 ( 17.5 hours ) with a mean zenith angle of 12 .",
    "most of the observations presented here had 1es  1218 + 304 as the principal target , resulting in different pointing offsets from the position of b2  1215 + 30 ( from 0.3  to 1.3 ) . given that the radial acceptance of the camera is not flat , this causes a lower average sensitivity for the veritas exposure . correcting for this effect , the total effective exposures on b2  1215 + 30 , are 29 , 38 , and 15 hours for the different observation epochs .",
    "after run selection and nightly calibration , image cleaning is performed to remove the night sky background contamination from the shower images .",
    "these images are then parameterized using a second - moment analysis @xcite .",
    "additionally , a log - likelihood fitting algorithm is applied to recover truncated images at the edge of the camera .",
    "after image quality cuts , the shower direction and core location are reconstructed for events having a minimum of three telescope images . for each event the energy is estimated from lookup tables , with an energy resolution of about 15 - 20% . to separate the gamma - ray events from the hadronic events , a set of optimized cuts based on image parameters",
    "is applied , as described in @xcite .",
    "the optimization of those cuts has been performed _ a priori _ on a 5% crab nebula - like source and yielded an energy threshold of about 250  gev for observations at 20  zenith angle .",
    "the remaining background is estimated using a ring - background model .",
    "the on region is circular , centered on the source position with radius @xmath9 .",
    "the off region is defined as a ring , placed around the on region , with inner and outer radii of 0.46  and 0.54 , respectively .",
    "the radii are chosen so that the ratio between on and off area is 1:10 .",
    "the normalization @xmath10 is given by the area ratio modified by the radial acceptance of the camera .",
    "regions around bright stars ( v magnitude @xmath11  7 ) , as well as the region around the position of 1es  1218 + 304 , were excluded from the background estimation .    the analysis of the total data set over the time period from december 2008 to may 2012 yields 259 events excess over background .",
    "the resulting detection significance is @xmath12 according to eq .",
    "17 in @xcite .",
    "the results of the three observing periods are presented in table  [ tbl-1 ] . in 2011 , the source was clearly detected with a significance of @xmath13 , while in 2008/09 and in 2012 the source is not detected with a significance greater than @xmath14 . before presenting the results of these two latter periods , we concentrate on the 2011 data set where the significant detection allows for a spectral analysis .    figure  [ fig1 ] shows the significance sky map for the 2011 data set .",
    "to determine the position of the vhe gamma - ray emission , a symmetric 2d gaussian was fitted to the excess sky map ( binned to @xmath15 ) of this data set .",
    "it revealed a point - like excess with the best - fit source position at r.a .",
    "= @xmath16 , dec = @xmath17 with a systematic uncertainty of @xmath18 .",
    "the veritas source is thus named ver  j1217 + 301 , and is positionally consistent with the bl lac object b2  1215 + 30 @xcite .    the derived differential photon spectrum of the 2011 data set is shown in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "it can be fitted by a power law ( @xmath19/ndf = 1.25/2 ) : dn / de = @xmath20 , with @xmath21 @xmath22 s@xmath23 and @xmath24 .",

    "this corresponds to 3.4% of the crab nebula flux @xcite above the same energy threshold .",
    "a 29.5-day binned light curve above 200  gev is produced and shown in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "a constant fit to these flux points showed no evidence for deviation from a steady flux ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "no significant flux variations within any monthly bin were detected either .",
    "an analysis of the data available outside the 2011 season revealed lower gamma - ray fluxes ( see table  [ tbl-1 ] ) .",
    "the 2008/09 data set analysis resulted in a gamma - ray excess of @xmath26 significance at the source location . using the method of @xcite",
    ", this excess corresponds to a 99% upper limit above 200  gev of 2% of the crab nebula flux , assuming the same spectral index as derived in 2011 . in 2012 , the source is observed with a significance of @xmath27 .",
    "given that it is an established vhe emitter a flux is derived : @xmath28 , corresponding to about 1.2% of the crab nebula flux above the same energy threshold .",
    "the hypothesis of a constant flux between the three seasons is excluded at the level of @xmath29 .",
    "this shows that the source was significantly fainter in 2008/09 and 2012 compared to the relatively bright flux state in 2011 , as shown both by magic and veritas measurements .",
    "the large area telescope ( lat ) on board the _ fermi _ satellite is a pair - conversion gamma - ray telescope sensitive to photon energies from 20 mev to a few hundred gev @xcite .",
    "a binned likelihood analysis was performed using the lat sciencetools ( version v9r23p1 ) and p7source_v6 instrument response functions .",
    "`` diffuse '' class events with @xmath30 in a square region of interest ( roi ) of @xmath31 around b2  1215 + 30 were selected .",
    "the center of the roi was shifted by 4  towards the bright fsrq 4c  + 21.35 ( 8.87  away from b2  1215 + 30 ) to avoid edge effects .",
    "further quality selection was performed by rejecting events with a zenith angle @xmath32 and a rocking angle @xmath33 in order to avoid contamination from albedo photons from the earth s limb .",
    "a background model was constructed including nearby gamma - ray sources and diffuse emission .",
    "all known gamma - ray sources from the second _ fermi _ catalogue ( 2fgl ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) within the roi were included in the model .",
    "sources outside the roi , but within 5  of the roi edges , were also included to account for possible photon contamination due to the large lat point spread function . as in the 2fgl catalogue , a log - parabola function was used for sources with significant spectral curvature .",
    "otherwise , spectra were described as a power law .",
    "the spectral parameters of the sources inside the roi were left free during the fitting procedure .",
    "sources outside the roi , but within 5  of the roi edges , had their spectral parameters fixed to the 2fgl catalog values . the galactic and extragalactic diffuse gamma - ray emission together with the residual instrumental background were also modeled using the publicly - available files .    a 14-day binned light curve using the first 48 months of the _ fermi _ mission was produced . during the period quasi - simultaneous with the 2011 veritas observations ( mjd @xmath34 ) ,",

    "potential contamination from the nearby source 1es  1218 + 304 ( at 0.76  distance ) was checked by producing a residual @xmath40 map ; no features or asymmetries in the @xmath40 distribution of b2  1215 + 30 were seen .",
    "it is worth noting that in the gev range the flux of 1es  1218 + 304 is @xmath41 times that of b2  1215 + 30 , in contrast to the vhe regime , where 1es  1218 + 304 is typically much brighter .    given the clear variability seen in the vhe band , a mean flux above 200  mev contemporaneous with the 2008/09 and 2012 veritas observations was derived and is @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "the hypothesis of a constant flux in the high - energy regime between the three seasons contemporaneous with the veritas observations can be rejected at the @xmath44 level .",
    "the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) on board the _ swift _ satellite is designed to measure x - rays in the @xmath45 kev energy range @xcite .",
    "target of opportunity observations were obtained in january 2011 ( mjd @xmath46 ) , following the detection of vhe emission from b2  1215 + 30 , as well as on 10 nights in april / may 2011 ( mjd @xmath47 ) .",
    "all xrt data presented here were taken in photon counting mode with negligible pile - up effects .",

    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "the correlation coefficient is found to be @xmath53 with an uncertainty of @xmath54 .",
    "this implies a strong ( negative ) correlation between spectral index and integrated flux of the x - ray observations .",
    "a similar anti - correlation could also be seen in several other vhe - emitting blazars , e.g. , the ibls ver  j0521 + 211 @xcite or w  comae @xcite .",
    "however , this trend of `` harder when brighter '' is not always been observed in vhe blazars , e.g. no correlation between x - ray flux and its spectral index could be detected during the low vhe - flux state of the blazar 1es  1959 + 650 @xcite .",
    "a _ swift _ ultra violet and optical telescope ( uvot ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) analysis has been performed including all the observations performed between january and may 2011 .",
    "exposures were taken in v , b , u , uvw1 , uvm2 and uvw2 pass bands in _ image mode _ , discarding the photon - timing information .",
    "the photometry was computed following the general prescription of @xcite and @xcite , carefully excluding the contribution from nearby faint objects .",
    "a dedicated inter - calibration study between optical , uv and x - ray datasets was carried out , adopting the @xmath55 parameter for the hydrogen column ( obtained from the lab survey ) .",
    "the results were reddening corrected using @xmath56 mag @xcite .",
    "then , the corresponding optical / uv galactic extinction coefficients were computed ( @xmath57 ) and applied @xcite .",

    "no zodiacal light correction was introduced . for each filter ,",
    "the integrated flux was computed by using the related effective frequency and not convolving the filter transmission with the source spectrum .",

    "in addition to these r - band observations , b2  1215 + 30 was observed with the 1.3  m mcgraw - hill telescope of the mdm observatory , located at kitt peak , arizona , during one week in may 2011 ( mjd @xmath60 ) , using standard v , r , and i filters .",
    "the data were bias - subtracted and flat - fielded using the routines of the image reduction and analysis facitily ( iraf ; @xcite ) .",
    "comparative photometry with stars of known magnitude was performed and the resulting light curve is shown in figure  [ fig3 ] showing clear variability contemporanous with the veritas measurements .",
    "this is in line with the variability seen on the publicly available light curves from the tuorla observatory .    for the construction of the optical sed using mdm observations ,",
    "the magnitudes were corrected for galactic extinction according to @xcite .",

    "an sed was constructed using the multi - wavelength data obtained in 2011 . during this time",
    ", no variability was detected in the high- or very - high - energy regimes .",
    "given the low statistics in those energy regimes , the _",
    "fermi_-lat data contemporaneous with the veritas observations in 2011 are used ( mjd @xmath34 ) .",
    "variability is clearly seen in x - rays and , therefore , two spectra are extracted : one to represent the high x - ray state in january ( mjd 55565 ) and the other one to represent the low x - ray state observed in april / may ( using the combined spectrum from all observations between mjd @xmath64 ) . _",
    "swift_-uvot data simultaneous with the x - ray observations were used when available . given the relatively large systematic uncertainty of the uvot analysis , the quasi - simultaneous optical spectrum from mdm ( mjd @xmath65 ) is additionally used in the sed representing the low x - ray state . to complete the low energy part of the sed",
    ", archival data in the micrometer wavelength regime , taken from @xcite , are included .",
    "unfortunately , no information on the variability at those wavelengths is found , but since blazars are usually variable at all wavelengths , the inclusion of these archival data in the modeling will be discussed later .",
    "the extracted broadband sed , in the @xmath66 representation , can be found in figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "it shows a two - bump structure typical for blazars .",
    "based on the location of the synchrotron peak between uv and x - rays , the source classification as an ibl according to , or as an hsp according to @xcite , can be confirmed .",
    "however , this classification might only be true for the observations in 2011 reported here , as it is known that some blazars undergo spectral changes during flares which could change their sed classification , e.g. ver  j0521 + 211 @xcite .",
    "the sed is modeled with the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) model by @xcite , which assumes that the plasma jet is powered by accretion of material onto a super - massive black hole ( for details see * ? ? ?",
    "the emission zone is modeled as a spherical volume of radius @xmath67 moving with relativistic speed @xmath68 along the jet axis .",
    "the jet is directed at a small angle @xmath69 with respect to the line of sight to the observer . since the observing angle is very hard to measure , it is fixed within the model to the superluminal angle , @xmath70 , for which the ( bulk ) lorentz factor @xmath71 equals the doppler factor @xmath72 .",
    "the results of the model depend mainly on the doppler factor , hence other combinations of @xmath69 and @xmath71 resulting in the same doppler factor are also possible .    into the emission region",
    ", a population of ultra - relativistic non - thermal electrons is injected following a power - law distribution with low- and high - energy cutoffs @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively , so that @xmath75 for @xmath76 .",
    "the normalization of the electron distribution is related to the magnetic field @xmath77 through a relative partition parameter @xmath78 , defined as @xmath79 .",
    "@xmath80 is the kinetic power in the relativistic electrons and @xmath81 is the power in the poynting flux carried by the magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic field itself is a free parameter within the model .",
    "as the emission region is propagating along the jet , the continuously injected particles lose energy through synchrotron and ssc radiation and may escape from the emitting region .",
    "the particle escape is described by an escape timescale parameter @xmath82 with @xmath83 . as a result of the assumed quasi - equilibrium between particle injection , escape and radiative cooling ,",
    "a break in the electron distribution will occur self - consistently at a lorentz factor @xmath84 , where @xmath85 . depending on whether @xmath84 is larger or less than @xmath73",
    ", the system will be in the slow or fast cooling regime . in the fast cooling regime ( @xmath86 )",
    ", the equilibrium electron distribution will be a broken power law with @xmath87 for @xmath88 and @xmath89 for @xmath76 . in the slow cooling regime ( @xmath90 ) , the broken power law is of the form @xmath91 for @xmath92 and @xmath89 for @xmath93 .",
    "altogether , the ssc model described here has eight free parameters , listed in table  [ tab : veritasblazars ] .",
    "several of these parameters can be estimated from observables like the spectra obtained from multi - wavelength ( mwl ) observations as well as the measured variability time scales ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the absorption of vhe gamma rays on the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) is accounted for in the predicted fluxes using the ebl model of @xcite . here",
    ", a redshift of @xmath94 is used for the modeling ; we will discuss later how the results are affected if a redshift of @xmath95 is adopted instead .    in figure  [ fig5 ] the results of the ssc model are shown .",
    "it can be seen that the overall sed for both x - ray states in 2011 can be well described by the model .",
    "the solid lines represent the model for which the archival data in the micrometer waveband are taken into account . at those frequencies of around @xmath96  hz",
    ", a spectral break occurs due to the transition from fast cooling to the slow cooling regime .",
    "the position of this break is determined by the escape time scale , resulting in a large value for @xmath97 .",
    "the doppler factor is relatively large , with @xmath98 .",
    "using a lower doppler factor would require a larger emission region and hence a lower magnetic field strength , resulting in variability time scales longer than days ( following causality arguments ) .",
    "this lower doppler factor scenario would contradict the measurements of x - ray variability during the january observations .",
    "the magnetic field strength is found to be quite low , resulting in a very small relative partition parameter . a magnetic field far below equipartition ( @xmath99 ) , as found here ,",
    "might indicate a particle - dominated jet , in which the magnetic field in the emission region is self - generated and/or amplified in shocks .",
    "in contrast , a magnetic field near or above equipartition would be consistent with a poynting - flux - dominated jet in which magnetic field energy is transferred to particles , reaching approximate equipartition in the high - energy emission zone .    in order to account for the two different x - ray states observed in 2011 , the electron injection spectral index together with the magnetic field strength within the modeled emission region",
    "were changed .",
    "the injection index during the high x - ray state in january ( @xmath100 ) is found to be harder than during the low x - ray state in april / may ( @xmath101 ) . under the assumption that the particles in the jet are accelerated within relativistic shocks ,",
    "the spectral change in the electron distribution may be explained by a change in the shock field obliquity : a larger angle between magnetic field and shock front results in a harder particle spectrum ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this change of the injection spectrum also leads to flux variations in the high - energy peak .",
    "however , neither _",
    "fermi_-lat nor veritas are sensitive to those variations given the flux level of the source during the observation period reported here .    all of the above results are obtained by taking the archival data at around @xmath96  hz into account . however , due to possible variability in this waveband , we also modeled the sed of the source ignoring those archival data .",
    "the resulting model spectrum is represented by the dashed lines in figure  [ fig5 ] and represents the sed well .",
    "the only changes made to the model parameters were to reduce the value of the escape time parameter @xmath97 and the injection power .",
    "it was found that a value up to ten times smaller for @xmath97 could be used to model the sed .",
    "this means that the escape time scale may be shorter and the cooling break would occur at higher energies compared to the model including the archival data . additionally , the system is closer to equipartition , since the injection power for the electron distribution is lower ( with the same value for the magnetic field strength ) . due to the lack of simultaneous data in the @xmath96  hz domain ,",
    "@xmath97 and @xmath80 are unconstrained , resulting in a range of parameter combinations that describe the observed sed well .",
    "it is worth noting that in this , and most other one - zone leptonic models , the synchrotron emission from the gamma - ray emission region is self - absorbed at millimeter and longer wavelengths .",
    "therefore , these models are often unable to account for the radio emission , which is generally thought to be due to the superposition of self - absorbed synchrotron components produced further out along the jet @xcite , and is treated in one - zone emission models as upper limit .",
    "another difficulty of the model and its possible interpretation is the uncertainty in the redshift .",
    "we applied the same model to the sed using @xmath95 .",
    "we found that both x - ray states can well be modeled by a change of the electron injection spectral index together with the magnetic field strength .",
    "in this case , the doppler factor needs to be larger ( @xmath102 ) to compensate for the ebl absorption at high energies and the model - predicted fluxes are found to be slightly below the veritas spectral points .",
    "nevertheless , this is still compatible with the veritas measurement considering systematic errors , therefore , this redshift can not be excluded .",
    "as previously mentioned , b2  1215 + 30 was observed by magic early in 2011 . presented the source as an `` exceptional vhe @xmath103-ray emitting bl lac '' , mainly based on its sed and the results obtained from the mwl modeling . here ,",
    "the results of the modeling presented in section  6 are compared to those in the magic publication and then put into perspective with results obtained from other blazars detected by veritas .",
    "magic observed b2  1215 + 30 for approximately 20  hours between january and february 2011 and their spectral points are shown in figure  [ fig5 ] , compatible with the veritas measurements .",
    "quasi - simultaneous mwl data , also compatible with those obtained here , were used to construct the sed and were modeled by the ssc model of @xcite using the redshift of @xmath104 . in the paper , represent the data with ssc model parameters which are compatible with those obtained here .",
    "they also found that the same ssc model can well reproduce the data with a higher doppler factor ( @xmath105 ) or a higher minimum lorentz factor of the electron distribution ( @xmath106 ) . using these values for the model parameters",
    ", we did not succeed in fully representing the sed .",
    "the main reason is that the modeled high - energy peak is not broad enough to represent the low - energy points of the _ fermi_-lat spectrum .",
    "however , this part of the spectrum was not used in the magic publication .    to address the question whether b2  1215 + 30 is extreme in terms of its sed and model parameters ,",
    "the results of our modeling are compared to those obtained on all the veritas - detected blazars which have contemporaneous mwl data and are modeled with the ssc model by @xcite . in total , 6 hbls and 3 ibls are found ; the model parameters are listed in table  [ tab : veritasblazars ] .",
    "three of those blazars @xmath59 1es  0806 + 524 @xcite , mrk  421 @xcite , and w  comae @xcite @xmath59 were found in different flux states during the mwl observations and have more than one set of model parameters .",
    "pks  1424 + 240 @xcite and 3c  66a @xcite have been modeled using different redshift assumptions . while pks  1424 + 240 will not be included in the comparison study due to the current lack of redshift constraint ,",
    "two redshift values are given in table  [ tab : veritasblazars ] for 3c  66a , i.e. @xmath107 and @xmath108 , as they enclose the recently published redshift limits which were found to be in the range of @xmath109 @xcite .",
    "as one can see in table  [ tab : veritasblazars ] , most of the parameters used to model the sed of b2  1215 + 30 are well within the range of those used for previously detected blazars . the doppler factor , for example ,",
    "is usually found to be in the range of @xmath110 for the applied model .",
    "this is in agreement with other ssc models , e.g. @xcite .",
    "however , there are two parameters which are outside this `` standard range '' : the magnetic field strength @xmath77 and the escape time parameter @xmath97 .",
    "the first one is relatively low for b2  1215 + 30 and results in a very low relative partition parameter .",
    "for some of the other blazars , e.g. w  comae and 3c  66a , this behavior has also been seen . in those cases ,",
    "an ssc model with an external radiation field resulted in model parameters with larger magnetic field strengths and closer to equipartition .",
    "however , in the case of b2  1215 + 30 no improvement could be found by adding an ec component to the model - neither in the representation of the shape of the sed nor by bringing the system closer to equipartition . in general ,",
    "the magnetic field strength values obtained for the different sources are consistent with results from other leptonic blazar models .",
    "the second parameter , @xmath97 , is high compared to the model parameters of the other blazars .",
    "such a high value for @xmath97 implies long escape time scales .",
    "this could hint at a relatively well ordered ( laminar ) magnetic field in the emission region .",
    "however , it has already been shown in the previous section that the value for @xmath97 can be lowered significantly when taking only the contemporaneous data into account , without losing the ability to reproduce the shape of the sed .",
    "this value is then closer to values applied to the other veritas - modeled blazars . in summary ,",
    "the model parameters derived here for the applied ssc model are in the range of those derived from previous veritas blazar modeling . in this sense",
    "b2  1215 + 30 is a typical vhe - detected blazar .",
    "we have presented long term observations of bl lac b2  1215 + 30 at vhe energies with veritas between december 2008 and may 2012 . during these observations ,",
    "the source was clearly detected and showed clear variability on time scales longer than months , while variability on shorter time scales could not be detected . in 2011 ,",
    "the source was found to be in a bright state and a spectral analysis could be performed .",
    "the results are compatible with the magic results from early 2011 reported in .",
    "mwl data , quasi - simultaneous with the veritas observations in 2011 , were used to construct the sed of b2  1215 + 30 and confirmed its classification as an ibl . during these veritas observations",
    ", b2  1215 + 30 showed different flux states in the x - ray regime .",
    "these could be successfully reproduced with an ssc model by changing the spectral index of the injected electron distribution together with the magnetic field strength .",
    "our study finds a model description for the sed of b2  1215 + 30 similar to other tev - detected blazars .",
    "observations of b2  1215 + 30 by veritas will continue as part of a monitoring program on 1es  1218 + 304 , a tev blazar in the same field of view .",
    "this will allow a search for variability on different time scales and could result in tighter constraints for the input model parameters , as dedicated observations of b2  1215 + 30 can be triggered in case of an increased flux state .",
