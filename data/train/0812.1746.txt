    "we show different textures for sm-@xmath1 elastomers that depend on the constraints offered by the two sample geometries .",
    "the general mathematical problem of how textures in sm-@xmath1 elastomers make possible soft deformations in the presence of constraints has been attacked by adams _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "in particular it is possible to find geometries that are soft under tension and hence easier to verify experimentally .",
    "otherwise , sm-@xmath1 elastomers can deform via non - soft alternatives that fully satisfy constraints .",
    "these will also require the development of textures during deformation , and we calculate some of them here . in either case",
    "there will be barriers ( possibly smaller for soft textures ) between the two states of reversed polarization .",
    "the choice between soft and non - soft alternatives will depend upon whether one has sheet or slab geometry ",
    "we discuss both choices in section  [ sect : sample ] . in a companion paper to this @xcite it is shown that there are two possible types of stripe - domain , or texture , of which our textures that do not involve the rotation of smectic layers across the laminate boundary are drawn from one class . for chiral sm-@xmath1 elastomers , the internal boundaries",
    "are in general charged for the class we are dealing with ; the other class has uncharged internal boundaries @xcite .",
    "most experiments on sm-@xmath5 & c elastomers have involved mechanical and electrical changes to the tilt angle , e.g. @xcite .",
    "we are looking at goldstone modes that instead rotate the director about the layer normal at essentially fixed cone angle of tilt .",
    "experiments on polydomain sm-@xmath1 elastomers @xcite show that this rotation is easily possible and can in fact lead to gross reorganization of the domain structure , even its removal .",
    "being polydomain the deformation was not especially soft , but demonstrated lc mobility in this phase and offers hope for the deformations we predict here . in any event , we hope that the range of deformation paths we describe will urgently stimulate experiment to explore the ferro - electric response of smectic elastomers to shears opposed to the spontaneous distortion that arises on leaving the a - state .",
    "our theoretical models will show how completely open the understanding of these systems is .",
    "we adopt a particular model that successfully describes experiments on the non - linear rubbery and smectic elasticity of sm-@xmath5 elastomers , and which has also been applied to sm-@xmath1 elastomers .",
    "the underlying nematic rubbery elasticity is subject only to layers moving affinely with the bulk and then only allowing distortions of the bulk that then respect the constancy of layer spacing .",
    "thus material points @xmath33 and layer normals @xmath22 in the reference state transform as @xcite : = _ 0 = ^-t_0 .[eq : transforms ] the deformation gradient @xmath34 must respect rigid constraints of constancy of volume and of smectic layer spacing .",
    "this is because the shear modulus of the isotropic state of the elastomer and for the smectic for deformations not involving layer spacing changes is @xmath35 , nearly two orders of magnitude smaller than the smectic layer spacing modulus for elastomers and 4 orders of magnitude smaller than the bulk modulus , and hence deformations avoid layer spacing and volume changes .",
    "we discuss in appendix a how @xmath36 can be estimated by measurements in the sm state .",

    "the shape tensors of the network polymers , @xmath43 initially and @xmath44 after deformation ( when the director @xmath15 has possibly rotated to the new direction @xmath3 ) are of the form @xmath45 ( and analogously for @xmath44 ) where @xmath46 is the anisotropy in the distribution of polymer shapes .",
    "these tensors encode information about the direction of order .",
    "we take the distribution for simplicity to be uniaxial .",
    "this approximation is discussed in @xcite  effects due to rotation of the long axis of the anisotropic distribution are very large and give a first order description of a system that in reality is certainly to an extent biaxial .",

    "xz = ( r-1)/[eq : spont ] where the combination @xmath53 will repeatedly follow in the concrete examples of distortions we shall give .",
    "the molecular details are thus simply encoded . at fixed temperature , @xmath9 does not change if we also assume that anchoring is rigid , that is applied strains do not mechanically alter the tilt angle . in considering elastomers with extreme anisotropy of mechanical properties , we are implicitly dealing with smectic elastomers where the layer structure and other details of molecular ordering are on a higher energy scale than rubber elasticity @xcite .",
    "there may be systems in which tilt is not rigid under imposed strains , a possibility that has been considered theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "it is possible that the chain anisotropy @xmath46 might change with tilt @xmath9 and thus that the @xmath9 dependence is more complicated than appears in eqn  ( [ eq : spont ] ) .",
    "this complication will not concern us for elastomers at fixed temperature , and thus fixed tilt , during mechanical experiments .",
    "we are not dealing with smectic elastomers in which layers do not appear to significantly effect mechanical properties , for instance elastomers where one can induce compression of the smectic layers by applying an in - plane strain @xcite .",
    "likewise we are not addressing experiments that ( i ) use mechanical compression to alter the tilt angle ( thereby changing @xmath54 and hence a route to piezoelectricity ) or ( ii ) apply an electric field , alter tilt and hence generate strain along the layer normal ( an inverse piezoelectric effect ) @xcite .",
    "we now consider 3 explicit types of deformation in response to imposed shears that seek to redirect the spontaneous shears observed on the a to c transition .",
    "the deformations are treated separately .",
    "they have increasing freedom to exercise various sympathetic distortions which serve to progressively soften the elastic energy penalty .",

    "the imposition of shear in a slab geometry ( discussed later in figure  [ fig : textures ] ) is straightforward .",
    "it is also possible in sheets of the form of figures  [ fig : cartoon](c ) and ( d ) , up to a certain maximum shear where wrinkling on - sets .",
    "even corresponding sm-@xmath5 sheets , which are certainly not soft , have been successfully sheared to investigate mechanically - induced director tilt into the c - form ( the mechano - clinic effect ) @xcite .",
    "it is possible to find slightly softer deformation trajectories than that illustrated above by including the @xmath62 component of deformation . for systems with clamps allowing changes in the shape of the @xmath55 section of the elastomer , or for micro - structures that we will explore below",
    ", this extra freedom might be a way of reducing the elastic energy between the two minimal states at @xmath80 and @xmath79 .",

    "for the favorable case of the sheet , taking @xmath232v and thickness @xmath233 mm , the relative energy densities ( electrical to elastic ) are @xmath234  1 considering the range of values of @xmath54 given above .",
    "the reason is that internal electrical fields that set the scale of energies above are @xmath235 , much larger than those typically able to be applied here .",
    "one concludes that electro - mechanical actuation at very large shear strains ( @xmath236 ) will require the sheet geometry with large fields .",
    "the internal fields , that we argue could play a significant role in fixing the mechanical stability of these elastomers in their textured state , are perhaps open to direct observation that might help determine what rotations are accompanying shears .",

    "the field is not purely along the laminate normal because this direction is not a principal direction of the dielectric tensor .",
    "guest species with , for instance , characteristic absorption or fluorescence could be aligned with the field rather than with , say , the director or smectic layer normal . in particular",
    "a distinction between the field and director directions emerges as soon as rotation starts and would be an independent check of the development of microstructure . absorption or florescence probes suggested above are invariant under @xmath240 and thus would not find the alternating texture structure nugatory .",
    "it is likely that the choice of geometry , slab or sheet , will yield very different results .",
    "the deformation path taken by a smectic - c elastomer in having the direction of its spontaneous polarization mechanically or electrically rotated and eventually reversed is calculated for slab and sheet geometries .",
    "we are concerned with the goldstone mode of director rotation about layer normals on a cone of fixed angle , rather than mechanical and electrical induction of a change in cone angle .",
    "experiments on the alignment of polydomain smectic elastomers @xcite by external stress demonstrate that director rotation is easily possible and is an important aspect of deformation , as it is also in nematic elastomers . to conform to constraints",
    "while deforming at low elastic energy , it is proposed that textures develop .",
    "the laminates of these textures are at non - trivial angles to the layer system , and rotate with respect to the layers at the strain develops .",
    "different possible textures result according to geometry , the constraints at surfaces , the elastic shear energy , the role of semi - softness , and the charging of internal texture surfaces when they cut the polarization .",
    "one extreme case of geometric disproportionation is discussed and found to be unlikely .",

    "we are assuming rigid sm order  for instance elongations are accompanied by @xmath244 since contraction along @xmath109 is forbidden ( it would alter the layer spacing ) and these deformations are two - dimensional as in the case of sm-@xmath5 elastomers undergoing similar strains @xcite and which have been modelled in these terms @xcite . without rotations and other shears , the free energy can not drastically reduce , as in the rest of this investigation .",
