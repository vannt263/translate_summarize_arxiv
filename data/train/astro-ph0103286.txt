    "the significance of magnetic fields in the dynamics of molecular clouds , and in star formation itself , is still uncertain .",
    "theory and modelling have demonstrated that the strength of magnetic fields can have a profound influence on the processes which lead to the formation of stars .",
    "there is a critical ratio of magnetic flux to mass above which magnetic fields can prevent gravitational collapse ( magnetically subcritical ) and below which they can not ( magnetically supercritical ; e.g. mouschovias & spitzer 1976 ) . redistribution of magnetic flux by ambipolar diffusion in a magnetically subcritical region can lead to loss of support against self - gravitation , and eventually to low mass star formation ( see shu , adams , & lizano 1987 , myers & goodman ( 1988 ) , porro & silvestro ( 1993 ) , ciolek & mouschovias 1993 , 1994 , 1995 , safier , mckee , & stahler 1997 , ciolek & knigl 1998 ) .",
    "however , magnetically subcritical regions do not appear to reproduce observations of molecular cloud cores ( nakano 1998 ) , nor can this scenario explain the large fraction of cloud cores containing protostellar objects ( ward - thompson , motte , & andr 1999 ) .",
    "it is possible that magnetically supercritical regions can be supported by turbulence ( bonazzola et al .",
    "1987 , mckee & zweibel 1995 ) , which , to support a highly supercritical region , must be quite nonlinear ( myers & zweibel 2001 ) .",
    "recent 3d simulations ( heitsch , mac low , & klessen 2001 , hereafter hmk , ostriker , stone , & gammie 2001 ) demonstrate that strong turbulence can provide large - scale support against collapse , though it can not prevent collapse on small scales .",
    "the degree to which clouds are supported at all , of course , depends on their lifetimes and on the star formation rate ( ballesteros - paredes , hartmann , & vazquez - semadeni 1999 , elmegreen 2000 ) .",
    "magnetic fields affect other dynamical processes in clouds besides gravitational collapse . in a strong magnetic field , weakly compressible turbulence is anisotropic ( sridhar & goldreich 1994 ; goldreich & sridhar 1995 , 1997 ) and energy dissipation is relatively more in waves and less in shocks ( smith , mac low , & zuev 2000 ) , although the overall rate of energy dissipation is not strongly dependent on the fieldstrength ( mac low 1999 ) .",
    "magnetic fields may also play a role in collimating molecular outflows , and in transferring their momentum to the ambient medium .",
    "the actual strength of magnetic fields in molecular clouds will ultimately determine which theoretical picture is correct , so observations of field strengths are crucial .",
    "the integrated line of sight component of the field , weighted by the density of the tracer species , can be measured through the zeeman effect .",
    "however , zeeman mapping is time consuming and requires high sensitivity and the presence of particular tracers ( most commonly oh ) .",
    "moreover , this technique does not probe the field in the plane of the sky . for all of these reasons ,",
    "it is desirable to have a complementary method of mapping the field .    following the first detection by cudlip et al .",
    "( 1982 ) , it has been shown that the polarization of the far infrared thermal radiation emitted by magnetically aligned dust grains can be used to map the orientation of the magnetic field on the plane of the sky ( see hildebrand et al 2000 for methodology ) .",
    "this has been done , at various wavelengths , for a number of nearby clouds ( gonatas et al .",
    "1990 , jarrett et al 1994 , dotson 1996 , rao et al .",

    "2000 , schleuning et al .",
    "2000 , valle , bastien , & greaves 2000 , ward - thompson et al 2000 ) and near the galactic center ( werner et al .",
    "1988 , hildebrand et al . 1990 , 1993 , dowell 1997 , novak et al . 1997 , 2000 ) .",
    "far infrared polarization maps display the morphology of the field relative to other structures in the cloud , and can also be used to estimate the strength of the mean field according to a dynamical method originally proposed by chandrasekhar & fermi ( 1953 , hereafter cf ) .",
    "applications of the cf - method generally suggest fieldstrengths in the milligauss range or above .",
    "such fieldstrengths are larger than what is typically measured by the zeeman effect ( e.g. glenn et al . 1999 ,",
    "lai et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the cf - method is subject to errors arising from line of sight and angular averaging , and rests on the assumptions of equipartition between turbulent kinetic and magnetic energy , and isotropy of fluid motions .",
    "spatial averaging , by smoothing the maps , can give misleading impressions about the magnetic field morphology .",
    "however , since the information carried in the maps is unique , it is difficult to test the magnitude of these effects with astronomical observations .",
    "numerical simulations of turbulent , magnetized molecular clouds offer the means to calibrate the accuracy of polarization maps and develop new techniques to analyze them .",
    "the actual strength and structure of the field are known at all gridpoints and at selected times , as are the gas velocity and density .",
    "it is possible to create synthetic polarization maps , analyze them as though they were astronomical data , and check the accuracy of the results .",
    "that is the subject of this paper .",
    "ostriker , stone , & gammie ( 2001 ) have used a set of simulations to calibrate the cf - method in this manner .    in section [ sec : models - methods ] , we describe the numerical models and the method by which we generate polarization maps .",
    "most of the results relevant to polarization maps are in section [ sec : results ] , in which we discuss the morphology shown in the maps , implement the cf - method , devise an alternative to it , and show what can be learned about the spectrum of magnetic field fluctuations .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] is a summary and discussion .",
    "we base our investigation on full 3d models of driven mhd - turbulence in a cube with periodic boundary conditions , simulating a portion of the interior of a molecular cloud .",
    "we chose an isothermal equation of state , because the cooling times are much shorter than the dynamical times at the high densities typical of molecular clouds .",
    "we performed the simulations at @xmath3 and @xmath4 grid zones resolution using zeus-3d , a well - tested eulerian finite - difference code ( stone & norman 1992a , 1992b , clarke 1994 ) with second - order advection and a von neumann artificial viscosity to capture shocks .",
    "the mhd induction equation is followed using the method of consistent transport along characteristics ( hawley & stone 1995 ) .",
    "we employed the massively - parallel version of the code , zeus - mp ( fiedler 1998 , norman 2000 ) , to produce a data set at resolution @xmath5 .",
    "we used the uniform driving mechanism described in mac low ( 1999 ) . at each timestep",
    ", a fixed pattern of velocity perturbations is added , with the amplitude adjusted such that the energy input rate is kept constant .",
    "the driving results in an _ rms _ mach number of @xmath6 for models of series @xmath7 and of @xmath8 for such of series @xmath9 ( see table [ tab : models ] ) .",
    "the mechanism for generating the perturbation field allows us to select fixed spatial ranges .",
    "all models presented in this work employ driving at wavenumbers k=@xmath10 waves per box length @xmath11 .",
    "our measurements begin at system time @xmath12 = 0.0 , when the model has reached an equilibrium state between the energy dissipation rate due to shock interaction and numerical diffusion , and the driving energy input rate .",
    "self - gravity is implemented via an fft - poisson solver for cartesian coordinates ( burkert & bodenheimer 1993 ) .",
    "it is activated as soon as the model reaches the dissipation equilibrium at @xmath12 = 0.0 .",
    "the isothermal equation of state renders the system scale free . in code units ,",
    "the length of the box is @xmath13 and the mass is @xmath14 .",
    "we dimensionalize the results by choosing the jeans length @xmath15 , jeans mass @xmath16 , and free fall time @xmath17 ( see klessen , heitsch , & mac low 2000 for discussion of the scaling ) . the number of jeans masses and jeans lengths in each run are given in table [ tab : models ] .",
    "all the models are initialized with a uniform magnetic field stretching across the box along the @xmath18-direction .",
    "the field becomes distorted over time , but the magnetic flux @xmath19 through the boundaries should be constant according to the equations of ideal mhd , and is typically preserved by the code to a relative accuracy of 10@xmath20 - 10@xmath21 .    as in hmk , we scale the initial magnetic fieldstrength by the plasma beta @xmath22 .",
    "the parameter @xmath23 is directly related to the critical magnetic flux required to prevent global gravitational collapse ( see mckee et al 1993 ) @xmath24 where the constant @xmath25 is found to be 0.13 for a uniformly magnetized sphere ( mouschovias & spitzer 1976 ) and 0.16 for a uniformly magnetized sheet ( nakano & nakamura 1978 ) . here",
    "we choose the latter value .",
    "we find @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the ratio of mass to critical mass as in hmk .",
    "the models discussed in this paper span the range @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the alfvn mach number @xmath30 is related to @xmath23 and the sonic mach number @xmath31 by @xmath32 .",
    "thus , we consider both sub - alfvnic and super - alfvnic models .    a detailed discussion of the model sets is given by hmk .",
    "here we describe their physical properties just briefly .",
    "the supersonic turbulence supports the gravitationally unstable region against global collapse , however , it can not prevent local collapse , even in the presence of magnetic fields too weak to provide magnetostatic support .",
    "collapsing regions evolve from shock - induced filaments and cores .",
    "the models reach density contrasts of @xmath33 orders of magnitude above and below the mean density .",
    "the gravitationally bound regions can be interpreted as the initial stages of a protostellar core which may subsequently evolve into stars . once a core begins to collapse",
    ", we can not resolve it well enough to follow its evolution further ( truelove et al .",
    "1997 , hmk ) .",
    "the isotropy of a model depends largely on its field strength . for the weak - field - model @xmath34 ,",
    "the resulting distribution of magnetic energy is fairly isotropic , whereas for the models with stronger fields ( e.g. @xmath35 ) , the field imprints its initial direction onto the gas flows .",
    "the flows , in turn , act on the field .",
    "two quantities of interest for the polarization studies are the ratio of the mean field energy to the total magnetic energy , @xmath36 , and the dispersion in the angle @xmath37 between the local magnetic field direction and the mean direction , @xmath38 ( the two are not equivalent ; for example , the energy in the field could be increased by collecting it into strong unidirectional filaments with no dispersion in angle ) .",
    "both quantities are given in table [ tab : turbcharacter ] .",
    "equipartition between turbulent kinetic and turbulent magnetic energy is often assumed in astrophysics ; it has been shown to hold rigorously only in certain cases , such as weak alfvn wave turbulence ( zweibel & mckee 1995 ) and the incompressible alfvnic turbulence modelled by goldreich & sridhar ( 1997 ) .",
    "observations do not yet yield clear evidence for or against equipartition , although data collected by crutcher ( 1999 ) tend to speak against it .",
    "the models discussed here are not in exact equipartition ; the ratio @xmath39 of turbulent magnetic to turbulent kinetic energy for each model is listed in table [ tab : turbcharacter ] , and is typically a few tenths .",
    "it is unclear whether these departures from equipartition occur for physical reasons related to the nature of nonlinear , compressible mhd turbulence or occur because of numerical diffusivity or the nature of the forcing .",
    "we take the deviation from equipartition into account in   [ subsec : res - cf ] to correctly interpret our polarization maps .",
    "the model cubes include density , magnetic fields and velocity fields .",
    "these data allow us to derive the stokes parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 , and the polarized intensity @xmath42 according to zweibel ( 1996 ) @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 give the field vectors in the plane of sky perpendicular to the line of sight and are taken directly from the simulations .",
    "we integrate along the line of sight in @xmath46-direction .",
    "the function @xmath47 is a weighting function which accounts for the density , emissivity , and polarizing properties of the dust grains . in this paper , we take it to be the gas density normalized by the mean density .",
    "the polarized intensity is @xmath48 , and the polarization angle is @xmath49    equation ( [ equ : stokesparm ] ) is an approximate solution of the full radiative transfer equation for the stokes parameters ( martin 1974 , lee & draine 1985 ) , valid for small polarization and low optical depth . at far infrared wavelengths , and at typical column densities for molecular clouds ,",
    "the medium can safely be assumed to be optically thin ( hildebrand et al . 2000 ) .",
    "polarization maps are made at finite resolution .",
    "we simulate the telescope beam by applying a gaussian filter of the form @xmath50 to the complex polarization @xmath42 given in equation ( [ equ : stokesparm ] ) .",
    "the width @xmath51 of the smoothing filter should not exceed one eighth of the box length @xmath11 . for @xmath52 , the tails of the filter  exceeding the map s area",
    " would contribute to such an extent that neglecting them would yield a too small average .",
    "for each model , we generated polarization maps with a set of smoothing widths @xmath53 .",
    "the 2d polarization maps serve a threefold purpose : we discuss how their structure depends on self - gravity and limited observational resolution (   [ subsec : res - struct ] ) , and we show that there is no preferred alignment between filamentary structures in our simulations and the magnetic fields (   [ subsec : res - filament ] ) . finally , in   [ subsec : res - cf ] we discuss the chandrasekhar - fermi method of determining the mean field and an extension , which determines the rms field , both of which we test and calibrate .",
    "the polarization maps showing column density and polarization vectors ( fig .",
    "[ fig : polmap - maps ] left column , model @xmath35 ) are highly structured .",
    "shock fronts moving through the gas initiate formation of filaments and knots .",
    "after one free - fall time ( lower left panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : polmap - maps ] ) , the filaments fragment and concentrate due to self - gravity .",
    "qualitatively , no influence of self - gravity on the large - scale structure of the field is discernible , although there is some effect on the smallest scales .    smoothing these maps with a gaussian filter of @xmath54 pixels width ( fig . [",
    "fig : polmap - maps ] right column , @xmath35 ) leads to a clumpier appearance of the previously well - defined filaments .",
    "any substructure in these is lost .",
    "single shock structures are smeared out .",
    "as expected , the field appears more uniform , thus in our case indicating more and more its initial orientation .",
    "small scale variations in the field indicating turbulence and defining the turbulent cascade are lost due to the smoothing .",
    "figure [ fig : smoothphi ] quantifies this effect in model @xmath35 .",
    "it shows the power spectrum of the angle between the local and the mean magnetic field .",
    "this is equivalent to the line of sight averaged spectrum of the magnetic field fluctuation amplitude ( recall that the total power in fluctuations is given in table [ tab : turbcharacter ] ) .",
    "increasing the smoothing width from @xmath55 to @xmath56 results in a power loss of @xmath57% .",
    "structures at a wave number of @xmath58 are suppressed by more than two orders of magnitude .",
    "the diamonds in figure [ fig : smoothphi ] indicate the power spectrum of perturbed against mean field energy @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the magnetic energy corresponding to the perturbed field components perpendicular to the mean field .",
    "we use this as a measure of the true disorder in the magnetic field and as a gross check whether the polarization angles mirror the behaviour of the energies .",
    "some power loss between the true angular dispersion and even the unsmoothed fluctuation amplitude is inevitable , because the latter involves line of sight averaging while the former is a true 3d quantity .",
    "inspection of figure ( [ fig : polmap - maps ] ) shows no dramatic effects caused by self gravity after one free - fall time .",
    "figure ( [ fig : ang - dist ] ) shows that the width of the distribution of polarization angles does not change significantly under the effect of self - gravitation , but does certainly decrease with increasing beam width , as expected .",
    "the emerging asymmetry results from the reduced statistics due to the increasing beam width .",
    "although every pixel contributes to the histogram , the number of independent measurements decreases with increasing beam width .",
    "there is an ongoing debate on the mechanisms generating the observed filamentary structures of molecular clouds ( e.g. loren 1989 , johnstone & bally 1999 , matthews & wilson 2000 ) .",
    "shocks come to mind as a natural explanation , either compressing the material ( as in the simulations presented ) or generating downstream flows resulting in the filaments ( loren 1989 ) .",
    "the alignment of the magnetic field with the filaments has been used as a test for the validity of different filament models .",
    "the observations seem to favour no definite alignment .",

    "this power loss should depend on the steepness of the power spectrum .",
    "this suggests that it might be possible to measure the spectrum of magnetic field fluctuations by smoothing polarization maps by different filter widths , and comparing the dispersion of polarization angles .    to illustrate this relation",
    ", we will describe the smoothing as a convolution and then will determine analytically the loss of power in a spectrum due to smoothing .",
    "the convolution would be @xmath119 with the wave function @xmath120 @xmath121 and the gaussian filter function @xmath122 as in equation  ( [ equ : gaussfilter ] ) .",
    "we identify @xmath120 with the @xmath123 of equation  ( [ equ : per - b ] ) . instead of convolving directly , we use the fourier transforms @xmath124 $ ] and @xmath125 $ ] of equations  ( [ equ : def - wave ] ) and ( [ equ : gaussfilter ] ) to derive the power spectrum of the convolved function @xmath126|$ ] via the convolution theorem @xmath127 where the hatted quantities denote fourier transformations .",
    "the fourier transform of a gaussian yields again a gaussian , in our case with an additional phase shift .",

    "figure [ fig : cf - powerloss ] illustrates the behaviour of @xmath139 for several values of @xmath140 .",
    "note that this is a log - linear plot , so that , for example , @xmath141 . curves for @xmath142 have negative , the ones for @xmath143 positive curvature . normalizing the curves for @xmath143 with @xmath144 and plotting them together with the inverse of the ratio of estimated to model field strength @xmath101 of model @xmath145 yields figure [ fig : cf - powerlosscomp ] .",
    "we normalized @xmath101 to @xmath55 as well , in order to compare the measurements to the analytic curves @xmath139 .",
    "we note that the measurements start to flatten off for small @xmath146 because of line of sight averaging , which we do not include in the analytic derivation .",
    "the same argument applies for observations .",
    "thus , even in the ideal case of @xmath55 , the measurement may not reach @xmath147 but may overestimate the actual field strength .",
    "of course , this would crucially depend on the length of line of sight and , generally , on optical depth effects .",
    "they , however , are neglegible in the far - infrared regime . because we need a certain length in the line of sight in order to derive a meaningful velocity dispersion @xmath63 , this overestimate due to line - of - sight averaging gives an intrinsic error in the cf - methods .",
    "the power spectrum of angular variations in the simulations is by no means a clear power law , due to numerical dissipation and the signatures of the driving scale .",
    "thus , the measured @xmath148 ( fig . [ fig : cf - powerlosscomp ] ) does not correspond clearly to one of the analytic curves .",
    "however , if observations show a well defined power law in the angular variations @xmath64 , and provide sufficient resolution to create a series of maps smoothed over larger and larger areas , then it should be possible to extract information about the exponent of the power law and to correct the field estimate as well .",
    "once a power law description is found for the observed region , @xmath149 supplies a correction factor for the field strength estimate @xmath150 .    in polarization maps derived from observations ,",
    "an additional effect could potentially lead to a systematic overestimation .",
    "when we derive the field estimates from our models , we use the complete domain , thus including all wave lengths occurring in the problem . however , it is not clear whether the observations do trace the largest scales in the field perturbations .",
    "if the power of angular variations is distributed in a power spectrum which decreases with increasing wave number , we will lose overproportionally much power when estimating the field strength within a domain which is smaller than the largest wave length contributing to the perturbations .",
    "figure [ fig : cf - subframes ] illustrates this effect contributing to a systematic overestimation of the field strength .",
    "it shows the ratios @xmath151 for subframes of @xmath152 , @xmath153 and @xmath154 cells for model @xmath145 at @xmath4 resolution .",
    "we averaged the estimates from all possible subframes .",
    "the error bars indicate the standard deviations of the means . with decreasing frame size , the field is overestimated slightly , thus indicating a decrease of @xmath64 .",
    "however , bearing in mind the large scatter around the mean values in figure [ fig : cf - subframes ] , this effect is not very distinct .",
    "we conclude that , although the cf - methods are applicable in principle to molecular clouds , the resulting field strengths are most likely to be systematically overestimated for two reasons : ( a ) any smoothing introduced by the finite telescope beam size will lead to a systematic removal of large - scale perturbations and thus to an overestimation of the field strength .",
    "( b ) deriving field estimates for a domain smaller than the maximum perturbation wave length present leads to power loss on large scales and thus as well to an overestimated field strength .",
    "this systematic overestimation due to limited resolution is different from uncertainties because of non - equipartition as discussed in ",
    "[ subsubsec : res - cf - calib ] . in order to draw these conclusions",
    "we assume that the underlying power spectrum of perturbations follows a power - law - like distribution , at least , that it decreases with increasing wave number .",
    "figure [ fig : resolution - cf ] presents a test for resolution with models @xmath155 and @xmath145 at @xmath3 and @xmath4 grid cells . the beam width @xmath156 is given in pixels .",
    "note that in order to compare both models , we have to compare them at the same _ physical _ beam width , i.e. we have to shift a data point of model @xmath155 at @xmath157 such that it corresponds to a point of @xmath158 .",
    "we corrected all estimates with @xmath159 ( see table [ tab : turbcharacter ] ) in order to account for non - equipartition .",
    "discrepancies at small scales are to be expected as model @xmath155 then already reaches the grid scale .",
    "figure [ fig : resolution - cf ] allows us to conclude that numerical resolution does not affect our calibration of the cf - methods .",
    "thus we feel justified to draw conclusions for observations of turbulent regions from our simulated observations of computational turbulence .      we still have to substantiate the claim leading to equation  ( [ equ : rms - b ] ) , namely , that our simulated turbulent flows are isotropic enough to validate that the field components perpendicular to the mean field @xmath160 obey @xmath161 and that the field perturbations in all three directions fulfill @xmath162 .",
    "the upper panel of figure [ fig : cf - claim - test ] supports the second assumption .",
    "there occur only minor differences in the _ rms _ values .",
    "note that the initially homogeneous background field is oriented along the @xmath18-direction .",
    "thus , we had to subtract this background in order to determine the corresponding mean values , yielding @xmath163 ( lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cf - claim - test ] ) .",
    "the scatter of the means is considerably larger , however their absolute values are three to four orders of magnitudes lower than the corresponding field strengths .",
    "ideally , the means should vanish , especially in the directions perpendicular to the initial field , namely the @xmath164- and @xmath46-direction .",
    "deviations from this ideal case are probably due to numerical diffusion in the code .",
    "this results in not conserving the total flux per coordinate direction .",
    "the small shifts in the means thus indicate how well the code actually does conserve the total flux .",
    "reliable methods for measuring and mapping magnetic fields in molecular clouds are urgently needed in order to assess the role of magnetic fields in the dynamics of molecular clouds and in star formation .",
    "probes based on far infrared polarimetry of the thermal emission from magnetically aligned dust are now in widespread use .",
    "far - ir polarimetry is complementary to the zeeman method , which is the traditional means of measuring the field .",
    "there are few independent checks of its accuracy as a diagnostic of magnetic fields .    in this paper we used numerical simulations of turbulent , magnetized , self gravitating molecular clouds to assess the reliability of polarization maps .",
    "although such simulations qualitatively reproduce many of the features seen in molecular clouds , we do not expect the computed densities , velocities , and magnetic fields to be completely realistic .",
    "we undertook the project with the expectation that analysis of simulated data would bring out the same issues as analysis of real data .",
    "we assumed that the polarized emission is optically thin and proportional to gas density .",
    "the first assumption should be excellent .",
    "the second could be modified , for example by modelling the grain temperature point to point within the cloud .",
    "it might be possible to pick out particular structures along the line of sight by comparing maps at different wavelengths , but establishing this is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "1 .   filaments produced by shocks do not show a preferred alignment with the magnetic field .",
    "self - gravity has no discernible effect on the structure of the magnetic fields in our simulations .",
    "however , we have to bear mind that our self - gravitating regions are small with respect to the simulated region .",
    "3 .   the chandrasekhar - fermi method in its original version yields field estimates accurate up to @xmath165 .",
    "a modified version determining the rms field @xmath166 results in in @xmath167 .",
    "this version proves to work more reliably for slightly weaker field strengths .",
    "both methods should be applicable to magnetic fieldstrengths typical of molecular clouds .",
    "the geometrical mean @xmath168 yields field estimates accurate up to a factor of @xmath169 even for the weakest fields . for moderate and stronger fields , @xmath170 .",
    "thus , this recipe improves the reliability of field strength estimates for the whole range of physically realistic fields in molecular clouds , and may prove useful when applied to observational data .",
    "the original and modified chandrasekhar - fermi methods are based on the assumption of equipartition between turbulent kinetic and magnetic energy .",
    "the field fluctuations in the models are below equipartition , leading to an overestimate of the field .",
    "limited angular resolution again leads to systematic overestimation of the magnetic field strength for both methods .",
    "two effects can cause this overestimation : ( a ) in a power spectrum decreasing with increasing wave number , smoothing leads to an overproportionally large power loss on larger scales .",
    "thus the angular variations are underestimated , which leads to larger field strengths .",
    "( b ) if the domain used for deriving the field estimate does not trace the largest wave modes , this again leads to power loss on the largest scales .",
    "if the power spectrum of magnetic field fluctuations is a power law , field estimates made from a series of maps with different smoothing widths can in principle be used to estimate the exponent of the fluctuation spectrum , assuming that this is well enough defined over at least two decades . with this information",
    ", one could correct for the overestimated field strengths .",

    "<S> taking the geometric mean of both methods estimates even the weakest fields accurately within a factor of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> limited telescope resolution leads to a systematic overestimation of the field strengths for all methods . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the effects responsible for this overestimation and show how to extract information on the underlying ( turbulent ) power spectrum . </S>"
