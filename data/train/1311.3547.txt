    "the story of @xmath2 measurements began in 1985 when the cleo and cusb collaborations reported the first `` observation of a new structure in the @xmath4 cross section above the @xmath5 '' , with @xmath6 of data collected at the cornell electron storage ring.@xcite the observed @xmath2 resonance is a bottomonium state ( quark content @xmath7 ) with a mass of @xmath8 and a width of @xmath9.@xcite in the ensuing two decades , cleo and the @xmath4 @xmath10-factory experiments , belle and  at kekb ( tsukuba , japan ) and pepii ( stanford , us ) , focussed on taking data at energies near the mass of the @xmath5 resonance , which is just above the kinematic threshold for pair production of @xmath11 and @xmath12 pairs and therefore provides an ideal environment to study the decays of these mesons .",
    "the heavier @xmath13 mesons can not be produced at @xmath5 , but it is possible at higher collision energies .",
    "it was in 2003 when a larger @xmath2 data sample of @xmath14 was collected by the cleo iii detector .",
    "analysis of this data led to the first evidence for @xmath13 production at the @xmath2 energy.@xcite this sparked interest in the @xmath2 resonance at the belle experiment and the first @xmath15 data sample was collected from 2005 to 2006 and then extended to a total integrated luminosity of @xmath16 collected from 2008 to 2009 . belle s",
    "@xmath2 data sample is by far the largest to date , and all results in this review are obtained from it .    while the main goal of the @xmath2 physics program was to study the decays of the @xmath13 meson ,",
    "it turned out that belle s large data sample is also an ideal base to study the bottomonium spectrum and to discover unexpected states .",
    "we structure this review in two parts : in the first part , we discuss the @xmath13 measurements , and in the second , the spectroscopy of conventional and unconventional bottomonium states .    before presenting the results",
    ", we clarify some of the terminology used throughout this review .",
    "what is commonly considered as the @xmath2 peak in the @xmath4 hadronic cross section might contain a contribution from a neighbouring @xmath17 state which is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : yb ] .",
    "besides the resonant process @xmath18 and possibly @xmath19 , the hadronic cross section contains the so - called continuum processes @xmath20 , with @xmath21 . in the literature",
    "the label `` @xmath2 '' is used for the whole bottom production near the @xmath2 mass peak , including all resonant and non - resonant processes  in other words for everything but the @xmath22 continuum involving quarks lighter than the @xmath23-quark ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "we will follow this convention in this article .",
    "the @xmath10-factory experiments belle and  can look back on a veritable success story .",
    "their measurements of @xmath25 and @xmath26 meson decays significantly improved our understanding of @xmath27 violation and quark flavor transitions described by the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) mechanism.@xcite the knowledge of @xmath13 decays was , however , rather sparse until recently when belle started pioneering the investigation of @xmath13 mesons using the @xmath2 data sample .",
    "shortly after , the experiments at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) located near geneva followed , in particular the dedicated @xmath10-physics experiment lhcb .",
    "the lhc experiments profit from an enormously high @xmath13 production cross section , @xmath28 , at @xmath29 in @xmath30-collisions,@xcite compared to @xmath31 at the @xmath2 resonance.@xcite however , studying @xmath13 decays at an @xmath4 @xmath10-factory has certain advantages over measurements at a hadron collider .",
    "firstly , the number of produced @xmath23-flavored mesons is well known and absolute branching fractions can be measured .",
    "in contrast to the production at hadron colliders , @xmath13 mesons are produced in @xmath2 decays coherently in quantum mechanically entangled pairs .",
    "full or partial reconstruction of one of the @xmath13 mesons provides information on the second @xmath13 meson in the event , which is a prerequisite for inclusive analyses , for example the measurement of the @xmath32 branching fraction discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : bs2xlnu ] . a further benefit of an @xmath4 collider is the complete knowledge of the initial state that provides kinematic constraints for the reconstruction of undetected particles such as neutrinos .",
    "the analyses of @xmath13 decays with @xmath2 data build on the experience of @xmath25 and @xmath26 studies at @xmath5 by transferring the existing techniques to the higher collision energy .",
    "most @xmath13 analyses performed so far are untagged , _",
    "i.e. _ one @xmath13 is fully reconstructed in the signal final state , while the second @xmath13 in the event is not explicitly reconstructed .",
    "correctly reconstructed @xmath13 mesons can be separated from misreconstructed candidates by means of two variables : the beam energy constrained mass , @xmath33 , and the difference between expected and reconstructed @xmath13 energy , @xmath34 .",
    "the variables @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the reconstructed @xmath13 momentum and energy in the center - of - mass frame of the colliding beams , respectively . in @xmath5 decays , the @xmath37 pairs are produced close to the kinematic threshold , and decay nearly at rest in the @xmath4 rest frame .",
    "correctly reconstructed @xmath10 candidates have thus @xmath38 around the nominal @xmath10 mass and @xmath39 consistent with zero .",
    "the situation is a little different in @xmath2 decays , where not only the production of @xmath40 pairs is kinematically allowed , but also @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the mass difference between @xmath43 and @xmath13 is only @xmath44,@xcite thus the photon emitted in the @xmath43 decay has too low energy to be efficiently reconstructed .",
    "hence , true @xmath13 candidates populate three distinct regions in the @xmath39-@xmath38 plane depending on whether the @xmath2 decay was to @xmath40 , @xmath41 or @xmath45 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : deltae_mbc ] ) .",

    "the 2d distribution on the right shows @xmath46 candidates in the @xmath39-@xmath38 plane with the @xmath45 , @xmath41 and @xmath40 signal regions indicated by boxes .",
    "the @xmath13 candidates were reconstructed in @xmath15 of @xmath2 data collected with the belle detector.@xcite[fig : deltae_mbc ] figure courtesy of the belle collaboration.,width=480 ]      the @xmath2 resonance decays to @xmath47 pairs as well as to @xmath48 pairs and to final states with bottomonia , discussed later in this paper : the relative production fractions are denoted by @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively , and by definition they sum up to unity : @xmath52 .",
    "the parameter @xmath49 is a key ingredient to calculate the total @xmath13 yield in the sample , @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the integrated luminosity of the data and @xmath55 is the cross section of the process @xmath56 .",
    "the untagged branching fraction measurements presented in this review require @xmath57 as normalization and thus rely on @xmath49 .",
    "since the parameter @xmath49 plays such a central role for the normalization of the measurements , we discuss its determination in the following .",
    "the principle of all @xmath49 measurements is to compare decay rates to a chosen final state measured in a @xmath13-enriched and a @xmath13-depleted sample .",
    "one measures for example the inclusive @xmath58 rates in data recorded at @xmath2 ( @xmath13  enriched ) and @xmath5 ( @xmath13  depleted).@xcite the value of @xmath49 can be extracted from such measurements using the relation : @xmath59 the production fraction of @xmath25 and @xmath26 mesons at @xmath2 , @xmath50 , can be replaced by @xmath60 , where @xmath51 is estimated from the sum of measured branching fractions to bottomonium",
    "states.@xcite belle applied this method to the full @xmath16 data sample collected at the @xmath2 resonance and obtained the value @xmath61 , corresponding to @xmath62 million @xmath47 pairs .",
    "the dominant uncertainty in this kind of @xmath49 measurement arises from the uncertainty on the prediction for the branching fraction @xmath63 , which is taken from a model - dependent estimate.@xcite there are variants of this @xmath49 measurement that use inclusive @xmath64 , @xmath65 or @xmath10 yields.@xcite the available published measurements were combined and result in @xmath66.@xcite    an approach that avoids the dependence on hadronic branching fractions , which are difficult to predict , uses dilepton events where the leptons stem from semileptonic @xmath67 decays.@xcite the inclusive semileptonic @xmath13 branching fraction can be estimated with relatively high precision from the well measured @xmath25 branching fraction , and the @xmath25 and @xmath13 lifetimes @xmath68 and @xmath69 assuming su(3 ) flavor symmetry : @xmath70 the charge of the lepton ( @xmath71 ) from the semileptonic decay is sensitive to the flavor of the decaying @xmath23-quark . since the mixing probability for a @xmath13 meson , @xmath72 , is much higher than for a @xmath25 meson , @xmath73,@xcite and no mixing occurs for @xmath26 mesons , the measured rates of dilepton events with same - sign @xmath74 pairs ( @xmath13-enhanced ) and opposite - sign @xmath75 pairs ( @xmath13-depleted ) can be used to extract @xmath49 .",
    "so far , no results with this method have been published .",
    "the expected precision on @xmath49 is @xmath76 to @xmath77 , which would be equal to or better than the combination of all existing measurements .",
    "not only the fraction of events containing @xmath78 mesons , but also the fractions of the different modes @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath45 are of interest .",
    "these can be obtained from a fit to the @xmath39-@xmath38 distribution of fully reconstructed @xmath79 decays ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : deltae_mbc]).@xcite the most common mode is @xmath45 with a fraction of @xmath80.@xcite      decay time distributions of @xmath13 decays to final states such as @xmath81 give access to the @xmath27 violating phase of @xmath82 oscillations , @xmath83 , and the decay width difference @xmath84 of the light and heavy @xmath13 mass eigenstates .",
    "measurements of such @xmath13 decay time distributions are the domain of the lhcb experiment as it collects large @xmath13 samples with high boosts of the @xmath13 mesons , and has an excellent timing resolution sensitive to the fast @xmath13-oscillations . measurements with @xmath2 data can contribute to a better understanding of the resonance structure in the decays and provide measurements of the absolute branching fractions .",
    "the measurements in this section are untagged and use the variables @xmath38 and @xmath39 for signal extraction .",
    "the @xmath81 final state is a superposition of @xmath27-even and @xmath27-odd states and therefore @xmath83 and @xmath85 have to be extracted in an angular analysis.@xcite precise knowledge of the underlying resonant and non - resonant backgrounds is vital in this procedure .",
    "belle studied the contribution of @xmath86 , @xmath87 and the remaining non - resonant components to the total @xmath88 decay width by fitting the different contributions to the @xmath89 invariant mass distribution.@xcite the underlying s - wave component in the @xmath65 mass window is measured taking into account the possibility of an additional @xmath90 component .",
    "this approach provides complementary information to the time dependent angular analysis by lhcb.@xcite     and @xmath39 distribution of @xmath91 events reconstructe in @xmath16 of @xmath2 data collected with the belle detector .",

    "naturally , once belle had identified charged @xmath124 states , one might additionally expect the existence of neutral isospin partners . in order to search for them , the analogous @xmath126 transitions @xmath127 were investigated and the final - state dalitz plot was treated in a manner similar to that in the previously - described charged dipion study .",
