    "several strategies are possible in order to study the implication of the past and present experimental data on susy models and predictions of flavor signals in future experiments",

    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in this section , we give a brief description of the models considered in this paper .",
    "they are well - motivated examples of susy models , and are chosen as representatives that have distinct flavor signals .",
    "every model is reduced to the mssm at low energy scale , which is an @xmath25 supersymmetric gauge theory with the susy being softly broken . the mssm matter contents are the following chiral superfields : @xmath26 where the gauge quantum numbers are shown in parentheses .",
    "the mssm superpotential can be written as @xmath27 with an assumption of @xmath28-parity conservation and renormalizability .",
    "the susy breaking effect is described by the following soft susy breaking terms in the lagrangian .",
    "@xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 are the corresponding scalar components of the chiral superfields given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mattermssm ] ) , and @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 are @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 gauge fermions , respectively .",
    "the msugra consists of the mssm sector and a hidden sector where the susy is assumed to be spontaneously broken .",
    "only a gravitational interaction interconnects these two sectors .",
    "this gravitational interaction mediates the susy breaking effect from the hidden sector to the observable mssm sector , and the soft breaking terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : softtermmssm ] ) are induced in the following manner : @xmath43 where we assume the gut relation among the gaugino masses .",
    "the above relations are applied at the energy scale where the soft breaking terms are induced by the gravitational interaction .",
    "we identify this scale with the gut scale ( @xmath44gev ) for simplicity .",
    "thus the soft breaking terms are specified at @xmath45 by the universal scalar mass , @xmath46 , the universal gaugino mass , @xmath47 , and the universal trilinear coupling , @xmath48 .",
    "the soft breaking terms at the electroweak scale are determined by solving renormalization group equations .    in this model ,",
    "the only source of flavor mixings is the ckm matrix .",
    "new flavor mixings in the squark sector at the electroweak scale come from the ckm matrix through radiative corrections @xcite .",
    "in addition to the cp phase in the ckm matrix , there can be two physically independent cp phases .",
    "we take the complex phase of the @xmath49 term ( @xmath50 ) and the phase of @xmath48 ( @xmath51 ) as the new cp phases while we take the gaugino mass @xmath47 as real and positive by convention .",
    "these cp phases contribute to the neutron and electron electric dipole moments ( edms ) and experimental constraints on these phases are very severe .",
    "we assume that the generation mechanism of neutrino masses in this model does not affect the flavor mixing in the susy sector .",
    "for example , in the msugra model with right - handed neutrinos , which is described bellow , the effect of the neutrino mass on the flavor mixing in the susy sector is negligible in a small right - handed neutrino mass limit .",
    "recent developments of neutrino experiments have established the existence of small finite masses of neutrinos .",
    "a simple extension of the msugra model for giving small finite masses of neutrinos is introducing gauge singlet right - handed majorana neutrino superfields , @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "this is known as the type i seesaw mechanism @xcite .",
    "the superpotential can be written as @xmath54 which leads to the following higher dimensional term @xmath55 after heavy fields @xmath56 are integrated out at the energy scale below the majorana mass scale ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "this higher dimensional term yields the neutrino mass matrix by the electroweak symmetry breaking as @xmath58 taking the basis in which the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal , one can obtain the observable neutrino mass eigenvalues and the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) mixing matrix @xcite as @xmath59 from the neutrino oscillation experiments , it is known that there is a hierarchy among the two squared mass differences as @xmath60 .",
    "we define @xmath61 and @xmath62 so that @xmath63",
    ". therefore there are two possibilities for the neutrino mass hierarchy when the mass of the lightest neutrino is much smaller than the mass splittings .    *",
    "normal hierarchy : @xmath64 ; * inverted hierarchy : @xmath65 .",
    "when the overall mass scale is much larger than the mass splittings , all the three neutrinos are nearly degenerate in mass . in the present analysis",
    "we take    * degenerate : @xmath66 .    for numerical calculations ,",
    "we consider three sets of low energy neutrino parameters corresponding to the above three cases .    as for the soft breaking terms , scalar mass terms , @xmath67 terms and @xmath7 terms of sneutrinos , @xmath68 , are added as @xmath69 we assume that the soft breaking terms are generated in a universal fashion at @xmath45 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath70 we neglect the @xmath71 terms in the present work .",
    "these terms can significantly affect the edms , while contributions to the lepton flavor violation processes are sub - dominant @xcite .",

    "consequences of these mixings on lepton flavor violating processes have been investigated from various aspects .",

    "the pattern of the deviations from the sm predictions also depends on the texture of the neutrino yukawa coupling matrix in the su(5 ) susy gut with right - handed neutrinos .",
    "examining the pattern of deviations from the sm in the quark and lepton flavor signals , we can gain insights on the flavor structure in the susy models .",
    "in addition to experimental progress , it is important to reduce theoretical uncertainties to identify the deviations .",
    "in particular , theoretical issue to predict mixing - induced cp asymmetries in @xmath242 @xcite and @xmath243 @xcite modes within the sm need to be clarified because the deviation we expect is up to 10% level .",
    "notice that the significant flavor signals in the models with right - handed neutrinos appear in the case with sufficiently large neutrino yukawa couplings , which corresponds to the right - handed neutrino mass scale @xmath244 .",

    "the effects of the neutrino yukawa couplings are negligibly small for @xmath245 .",

    "these contributions are known to play an important role for particular cases of susy parameter sets due to large corrections to yukawa coupling constants through susy loop diagrams @xcite .",
    "the relevant parameter set corresponds to large values of @xmath246 and relatively small values of heavy higgs boson masses with large values of @xmath49 .",
    "the higgs exchange contribution induces drastic effects in processes like @xmath247 and @xmath248 @xcite especially for a large value of @xmath246 ( @xmath249 ) because of a high power dependence of @xmath246 . in some restricted parts of our analysis",

    "we have improved computational methods and updated phenomenological constraints from our works in previous publications .",
    "the most important effect is the inclusion of the constraint from the @xmath184 mixing from recent tevatron experiments .",
    "the maximum deviation for various @xmath213 transition processes turn out to be 10% level , compared to the previous results where the deviation at the level of 50% was possible . in this work , we also present predictions of tau lepton flavor processes . under the constraint of @xmath4 ,",
    "the tau lfv processes are promising to look for new physics effects , which are also related to @xmath213 and @xmath241 transition processes in susy gut models .",

    "<S> quark and lepton flavor signals are studied in four supersymmetric models , namely the minimal supergravity model , the minimal supersymmetric standard model with right - handed neutrinos , su(5 ) supersymmetric grand unified theory with right - handed neutrinos and the minimal supersymmetric standard model with u(2 ) flavor symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate @xmath0 transition observables in @xmath1 and @xmath2 decays , taking the constraint from the @xmath3 mixing recently observed at tevatron into account . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculate lepton flavor violating processes @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 for the models with right - handed neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate possibilities to distinguish the flavor structure of the supersymmetry breaking sector with use of patterns of various flavor signals which are expected to be measured in experiments such as meg , lhcb and a future super @xmath7 factory . </S>"
