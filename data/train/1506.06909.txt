    "quantum field theory in curved space - time @xcite has been developed as an approximate quantum theory of gravity in order to study particle creation by evolving universe @xcite and black holes @xcite , as well as inhomogeneities in the cosmic microwave background radiation and the large - scale structure of the universe @xcite .",
    "parker @xcite conceptualised the so - called adiabatic vacuum in order to have a notion of particles in curved space that comes closest to the usual one in flat space . for scalar fields in spatially flat friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) spacetimes",
    " ( i ) in a co - moving volume , the particle number density ( @xmath0 ) is an adiabatic invariant , ( ii ) particles of conformally invariant field with zero mass will not be created , ( iii ) the total number density of created particles of specific mass , summed over all modes is ultraviolet ( uv ) divergent and ( iv ) the stress tensor ( @xmath1 ) of created particles has quadratic and logarithmic uv divergences in addition to the expected quartic divergence",
    ".    various renormalization methods were developed to tame these infinities .",
    "the concept of _ adiabatic regularization _ was introduced by parker @xcite to make the total particle number density for scalar particles finite and later extended to tame the uv divergences in @xmath1 by parker and fulling @xcite . in adiabatic regularization",
    ", the physically relevant finite expression is obtained from the formal one containing uv divergences by subtracting mode by mode ( under the integral sign ) each term in the adiabatic expansion of the integrand that contains at least one uv divergent part for arbitrary values of the parameters of the theory .",
    "the number of time derivatives of the cosmological scale factor @xmath2 that appear in a term of the expansion is called the _ adiabatic order _ of the term .",
    "the adiabatic regularization scheme is particularly useful for numerical calculations . in @xcite",
    ", the authors have also shown that the adiabatic regularization is equivalent to the n - wave regularization ( which is essentially a variant of pauli - villars regularization @xcite ) used by zeldovich and starobinsky @xcite to renormalize the divergent @xmath1 for scalar fields in an anisotropic universe .",
    "like adiabatic regularization scheme , this method is also particularly suited for numerical computations @xcite .    among other standard techniques ,",

    "it was argued in @xcite that wkb ansatz is specifically designed to preserve the klein - gordon product and the associated wronskian condition , but not to preserve the dirac product and the normalization condition .    in the following , we present a simple formalism to determine @xmath0 and also to regularize the resulting @xmath1 for spin @xmath3 particles in spatially flat flrw universe .",
    "the essential difference between our formalism and that introduced in @xcite is explicit in the corresponding expressions of socalled ` out ' states . in our case ,",
    "the entire non - adiabaticity is incorporated in the bogolubov coefficients whereas in @xcite , the bogolubov coefficients are defined to be of particular adiabatic order .",
    "further , we have expressed quantum fields and other quantities as functions conformal time which is useful particularly in conformally flat spacetimes and lead us to simple structure of field equations .",
