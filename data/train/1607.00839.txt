    "numerical hydrodynamical simulations of the common envelope evolution ( cee ) have been performed for thirty years , e.g. , the 2d simulations conducted by @xcite , followed by the 3d simulations conducted by @xcite and then by @xcite .",
    "more sophisticated simulations have followed ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "two main goals are behind many of these simulations .",
    "the first goal is to determine the final orbital separation between the core of the giant star and the more compact companion ( secondary ) star .",
    "the second goal is to understand the manner by which the envelope is removed .",
    "although in many cases less than the energy released by the in - spiraling binary system is required to unbind the ce ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the removal of the ce is not free from problems ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    to overcome the envelope - removal obstacle ,",
    "extra energy sources have been proposed , such as recombination energy ( e.g. , @xcite for a recent paper ) , and jets launched by the secondary star ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "also , @xcite suggested that in some cases , both for stellar and sub - stellar companions , the energy source might be the giant luminosity itself ( nuclear burning in the core ) , under the assumption that fast rotating envelopes efficiently form dust and have high mass - loss rates .",
    "we adopt the view that in many cases jets launched by the companion can facilitate ce removal ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this holds for main - sequence ( ms ) stars as well @xcite , as they can accrete mass at a high rate @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite studied ce ejection by jets launched from a neutron star companion , but they did not consider jets to be a general ce ejection process .",
    "when the jets become efficient in envelope removal , such that they remove the entire envelope outside the orbit of the companion , the system does not enter a ce phase .",
    "instead , the system experiences the grazing envelope evolution ( gee ; @xcite ) .",
    "our goal is to explore some basic properties of the flow at the start of the gee .",
    "the numerical set up is described in section [ sec : numerics ] , and the results are presented in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "we summarize in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we run the stellar evolution code ` mesa ` @xcite to obtain an asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) model with zero - age - main - sequance mass of @xmath0 , solar metallicity , and no rotation .",
    "we let the star evolve until it reaches the agb stage after @xmath1 years . at that point",
    "the stellar mass is @xmath2 , the radius is @xmath3 and its effective temperature is @xmath4 .",
    "we then import the agb model into the hydrodynamic code ` flash ` @xcite , and prepare the setup for our gee simulation .",
    "we employ a uniform cartesian grid with a cell size of @xmath5 , and position the agb at the center @xmath6 .",
    "the grid is taken as a cube with side length of @xmath7 .",
    "we use an equation of state of an ideal gas with adiabatic index @xmath8 .",
    "as we are not interested in the inner parts of the agb star that requires short time steps , its inner @xmath9 region was replaced with a constant density sphere .",
    "this artificial setting causes some numerical mass and energy outflow from the inner region . to verify numerical stability",
    ", we run the simulation for two dynamical times before inserting the secondary .",
    "the agb stellar model develops a weak outflow , with kinetic energy negligible relative to the kinetic energy of the jet we will insert later .",
    "we insert a low - mass ms secondary star in a keplerian orbit around the agb star on its equator , at a radius of @xmath10 in two cases and at a radius of @xmath11 at two other cases .",
    "we neglect the effect of losing primary mass and envelope deformation , and keep primary gravity constant and spherically symmetric during the entire simulation . the gravity from the secondary ms star",
    "is neglected in solving the hydrodynamic equations .",
    "the secondary star is assumed to launch bipolar jets with a half - opening angle of @xmath12 and a velocity of @xmath13 .",
    "the jets are continuously injected from the momentarily location of the secondary star , and also have azimuthal velocity component equals to the orbital velocity of the secondary star , which is about @xmath14 .",
    "the jets are numerically inserted in a cone of @xmath15 length , which means a length of two cells in each direction .",
    "the amount of mass injected by the two opposite jets was calculated assuming bondi - hoyle - lyttleton accretion rate ( @xcite ) @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the sound speed and @xmath18 is the relative velocity between the secondary star and the envelope . for a companion performing a keplerian motion on the cool outskirts of an agb star @xmath19 , and",
    "the accretion radius is @xmath20 for the parameters used we find the accretion rate to be @xmath21 . as is usually found for jets from young stellar objects ,",
    "the mass outflow rate into the two jets together is @xmath22",
    "we run four simulations differing in the binary separation and mass injection rate of the jets , as summarized in table [ tab : simulationsummary ] .",
    "the jets expel gas from the outer layers of the agb star , causing mass interior to the location of the secondary to flow out .",
    "[ fig:4panel ] shows slices of the logarithm of density , and the absolute value of the projected velocity vector through the orbital and perpendicular planes at the time the companion in run 1 ends four orbital periods .",
    "slices of the logarithm of temperature through the perpendicular plane are also shown .",
    "the jets interact with agb envelope gas in the vicinity of the secondary star , and with circum - stellar gas that was expelled in previous orbits .",
    "the flow structure becomes very complicated .",
    ".list of simulations . [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     with _",
    "mass_scalar _ option in ` flash ` , we use two ` tracers ' to follow the material originated from the agb envelope and the gas injected by the jets .",
    "the tracers indicate the fraction of mass originate from the agb star and from the jets in each cell .",
    "[ fig : tracers ] presents a 3d map of contour surfaces with @xmath23 per cent of agb gas ( red ) and of @xmath24 per cent of jet gas ( blue ) , at @xmath25 for run 1 .",
    "the morphology of the jets can clearly be seen in the figure .",
    "the jets are injected from the secondary star in two opposite directions perpendicular to the orbital plane ( they also have an azimuthal velocity component due to the orbital motion ) .",
    "the jets are immediately diverted outwards by the dense agb gas .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : three - dimensional_density ] we present a 3d map of density contour surfaces .",
    "arrows represent the flow velocity .",
    "this figure clearly emphasizes the complicated flow structure .",
    "the figure shows separate color schemes and vector properties for velocity above and below @xmath26 .",
    "the high velocity gas comes from the jets and the agb layers it collided with .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the jets are deflected towards lower density regions .",
    "the slow velocity gas shows both rotation as a result of the secondary orbit , and an outflow as a result of the jets .",
    "we measured the mass that left the system through a sphere near the edge of the grid .",
    "[ fig : logmout ] shows this ejected mass as a function of time for the four simulations . in runs 3 and 4",
    "the secondary star starts its circular orbit inside the envelope , and larger amount of mass is ejected from the system during the time of the simulations .",
    "higher values of @xmath27 also yielded higher value of ejected mass .",
    "both these results are according to expectations .",
    "in late times of @xmath28  days , the time dependence is close to being exponential with similar rate for all four simulations .",
    "most of the mass injected in the jets leaves the grid .",
    "the ejected mass is up to @xmath29 at @xmath30  days , which is @xmath31 times the mass injected in the jets . in run 1 we find that @xmath32 per cent of the mass that left the grid has a positive energy , namely it isun bound . in run 3 we find that @xmath33 per cent is left unbound .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : angle ] we present the mass that left the grid over the first 8 orbital periods per unit solid angle as a function of the angle from the pole ( @xmath34 is the polar direction and @xmath35 is the equatorial plane ) .",
    "the graph represents the two sides of the equatorial plane as they are symmetric .",
    "we also show the value of @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the kinetic energy and mass , respectively , that left the grid through a circular surface from @xmath39 to @xmath40 .",
    "the quantities were calculated from @xmath41 to @xmath42 , about 8 orbital periods .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : angle ] we learn the following .",
    "( 1 ) there is a concentration of outflow in the equatorial plane ( see also fig . [",
    "fig : three - dimensional_density ] ) .",
    "this equatorial outflow is achieved without any gravitational field of the secondary star and without any rotation of the primary agb star .",
    "the equatorial outflow is a result of the action of the jets .",
    "( 2 ) along @xmath43@xmath44 from the polar directions there is a fast relatively massive outflow .",
    "this is mainly due to the material that originated in the jets and is deflected by the agb envelope ( see also figs . [",
    "fig : tracers ] and [ fig : three - dimensional_density ] ) .",
    "the outflow geometry and its role in shaping the descendent nebula is a subject of a forthcoming paper .",
    "we conducted preliminary three - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of the onset of the gee .",
    "the gee is based on jets launched from the secondary ms star that efficiently remove mass from the envelope of the primary agb star , to the extent it prevents the formation of a common envelope . in the gee",
    "the secondary star grazes the surface of the giant star , as in run 1 and run 2 listed in table [ tab : simulationsummary ] . for comparison we also simulated two cases where the secondary star starts rotating inside the giant envelope ( run 3 and run 4 ) .",
    "as expected , the flow structure is complicated , e.g. , the outflow strongly depends on latitude and longitude , and when integrated over time around the orbital axis there are two latitudes with peaks in the mass outflow rate and variations in the outflow velocity ( figs .",
    "[ fig : tracers ] , [ fig : three - dimensional_density ] , and [ fig : angle ] ) .",
    "the two opposite jets inflate two hot bubbles , one at each side of the equatorial plane ( temperature panel in fig .",
    "[ fig:4panel ] ) . due to the orbital motion these bubbles stretch in the azimuthal direction and expand outwards .",
    "the jets and the inflated bubbles lead to a concentrated equatorial outflow , despite that neither the gravity of the secondary star nor agb rotation were included in the simulation .",
    "we also find that if jets are indeed launched according to the expectation from the mass accretion rate ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : dotmaccrete ] and [ eq : dotmjet ] ) , they can efficiently remove gas from the agb envelope as the secondary star moves on a grazing orbit .",
    "we find that even if the secondary star starts to launch jets only after it penetrated to the giant envelope , the jets can nonetheless eject a large amount of mass from the region of the envelope outside the secondary orbit and near the equatorial plane .",
    "the main result of the present study is that the gee has a merit .",
    "our results also hint that jets might help in removing the envelope in a full common envelope evolution , i.e. , when the secondary is deep inside the envelope rather than grazing the surface . in a future paper",
    "we will improve our modelling by introducing a spiraling - in orbit that fully conserves the losses of energy and will follow the secondary for longer times as it dives into the agb .",
    "jets play an important role in the common envelope phase , especially during the onset of the common envelope .",
    "long lasting imprints of the jets , both in the gee and in the common envelope evolution , might be a complicated morphology of the descendant nebula , whether a planetary nebula or a nebula around a massive star .",
