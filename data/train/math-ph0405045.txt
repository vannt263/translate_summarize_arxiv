    "as is well - known the hilbert space is a natural framework for the mathematical description of many areas of physics : certainly for quantum mechanics ( and quantum field theory ) , signal and image analysis [ lynn(1986 ) ] , etc . in all of these cases",
    "any arbitrary vector can be represented in terms of the elements of some basis @xmath3 .",
    "the orthonormal basis is the one that mostly advocated by mathematicians .",
    "but unfortunately , orthonormal basis are sometimes difficult to find and hard to work with .",
    "so the generalization to the non - orthogonal basis vectors ( such as the one we will introduce in this paper denoted by @xmath4 ) has been proposed .",
    "these vectors have the properties such as fast convergence , uniqueness of decomposition , etc .",
    "the resulting object is called a _",
    "`` frame''_[ali(1993 ) ] ; or more precisely a _",
    "`` discrete frame''_. the non - orthogonal states are also used as a tool in _",
    "`` generalized measurement '' _ that is a very important subject in view of foundations of quantum mechanics , quantum nondemolition measurement and quantum information theory[peres(1995 ) ] .",
    "the present work which contains the construction of coherent states(css ) and squeezed state(sss ) using a special set of non - orthogonal but normalizable basis @xmath4 instead of orthonormal one @xmath5 can be classified in the discrete frame background .",
    "thus in our opinion this approach provides a more fundamental and certainly more flexible rule than that of the usual one considered extensively in the physical literature for construction of new generalized css , the concept which have attained the most applications in quantum optics , as well as other fields of physics[klauder(1985)-perelomov(1986 ) ] .    for simple harmonic oscillator ( sho ) in natural unit and with unit frequency we have @xmath6=1 , \\qquad     ( a^\\dag)^{\\dag}=a,\\ ] ] where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are standard annihilation , creation and hamiltonian operators , respectively . following the particular kind of deformation proposed by j. beckers _ et al _ [ beckers(1998 ) ] we consider the parametric harmonic oscillator by deforming the creation operator in such a way that @xmath10 without changing the annihilation operator .",
    "so the @xmath11-hamiltonian becomes @xmath12 note that @xmath13 , but as for sho yet we have : @xmath14=1 , \\qquad     [ h_\\lambda , a^\\dag _ \\lambda]=a^\\dag _ \\lambda.\\ ] ] to manifest our motivation for considering the special kind of deformation in eq .",
    "( [ def - creation ] ) we offer the following discussion . in a previous paper we have shown that a large class of generalized css can be obtained by changing the basis in the underlying hilbert space .",
    "we have presented a systematic formalism that the particular deformation which we employed in the present paper is a special case of the general scheme have been introduced in [ ali(2004 ) ] . to clarify more",

    "it is obvious that the oscillator algebra remains unchanged . now choosing @xmath27 and using ( [ genhf ] ) for the annihilation and creation operators on @xmath24 we recover the exact form of the deformation introduced by h. fu _",

    "i.e. _ @xmath28 other selections for @xmath29-operator lead to other families of generalized css . in this manner",
    "we have established the basic place of the particular kind of deformation , we have used in this work , in the general theory of constructing the css in non - orthogonal basis .",
    "the case in which the annihilation operator is deformed as @xmath30 , also have been already considered and discussed by s. t. ali and us in [ ali(2004 ) ] .",
    "the eigenvalue equation @xmath31 has been solved in [ beckers(1998 ) ] , and led to the @xmath11-states @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are respectively the well - known laguerre and hermite polynomials of order @xmath35 ) and @xmath36 is isospectral with @xmath37 , _",

    "moreover from this equation we see that @xmath53 which indicates simply the ladder operator formalism [ wang(2000 ) ] of the state @xmath44 .",
    "* d ) * by eqs . ( [ anihilate ] ) and ( [ create ] ) we obtain respectively @xmath54 and @xmath55 since @xmath56 , using eqs .",
    "( [ def - creation ] ) and ( [ def - hamilt ] ) and binomial formula we get easily the relation between the standard and @xmath11-fock space as : @xmath57 which suggests that every state @xmath44 in this non - orthogonal hilbert space can be regarded as a special finite superposition of @xmath58 in the standard fock space @xmath59 ( eliminated indices sho ) .    * e * ) as another point",
    ", we see that according to the result of our calculation in eq .",
    "( [ exp - nlamb - n ] ) , the states @xmath44 are indeed the intermediate number - coherent states denoted by @xmath60 which have been already derived by h. fu _",
    "et al _ in [ fu(2000 ) ] : @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 is a real probability restricted to @xmath64 , @xmath65 is the ordinary displacement operator will be defined later in eq .",
    "( [ displacement ] ) and @xmath66 is the photon - added coherent state or exited coherent states and @xmath67 is a coherent state . with this respect h. fu _",
    "et al _ suggested that the states @xmath68 ( and also @xmath69 are displaced exited coherent states .",
    "we are thankful for suggestion a scheme in ref . [ fu(2000 ) ] that during an experiment one can generate these states .",
    "they have shown that @xmath11-parameter depends physically on an external driving field ( @xmath70 ) in a cavity and the cavity resonant frequency ( @xmath71 ) through the relation @xmath72 .    * f * ) using eqs .",
    "( [ dis - exit ] ) and ( [ lambda - n ] ) and bch lemma , the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ exp - nlamb - n ] ) can be replaced by the compact and interesting formula : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is an operator - valued function which exponentially depends on @xmath11 and the annihilation operator .",
    "the coefficient @xmath75^{-1/2}$ ] is a @xmath76-number which keeps the normalizability of the deformed fock space , and the order of the laguerre polynomial match with the old number state which we wish to transform .",
    "* g * ) recently shanta _ et al _ [ shanta(1994 ) ] and in a systematic manner manko _ et al _ [ manko(1996 ) ] introduced nonlinear coherent states as eigenfunctions of a deformed annihilation operator @xmath77 , such that @xmath78 which the representation of these states in @xmath79 basis is giving by @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the nonlinearity function , @xmath82 , ( by convention @xmath83 ) and @xmath84 is an appropriate normalization factor .",
    "more recently j. recamier _ et al _ in [ recamier(2003 ) ] proposed a definition for @xmath2-coherent bound states as @xmath85 where @xmath86 is a normalization factor . following these consideration it is possible to rewrite the states @xmath44 in the form of normalized @xmath2-coherent bound states @xmath87 so the space spanned by @xmath88 can be regarded as a nonlinear ( or @xmath2-deformed ) fock space , with the nonlinearity function @xmath89 .",
    "it must be noted that the states @xmath44 are not eigenstates of the annihilation operator @xmath7 , because of the finiteness of the upper bound of the summation .",
    "for constructing the coherent states we begin with the definition of css as eigenstates of annihilation operator [ manko(1996 ) , das(2002 ) ] @xmath90 where we call @xmath91 , @xmath11-css . now if we expand @xmath91 in terms of @xmath44 basis @xmath92 then by eqs .",
    "( [ anihilate ] ) and ( [ ani - def - nl ] ) we get @xmath93 from which we find that the coefficients @xmath94 satisfies the following recurrence relation @xmath95 the normalization condition of the state @xmath96 leads to a complicated series for coefficient @xmath97 which after some straightforward but lengthy calculation one obtains : @xmath98,\\ ] ] where @xmath99 is the real part of @xmath100 . finally the normalized @xmath101-cs takes the form : @xmath102\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty     \\frac { \\alpha^n\\left(l_n^{(0 ) } ( -\\lambda^2)\\right)^{1/2 } } { \\sqrt{n ! } } |n\\rangle_\\lambda,\\ ] ] which is a _",

    "now we imply that by eq .",
    "( [ iter - crea ] ) the @xmath11-css in eq .",
    "( [ lambda - cs ] ) can be expressed in terms of the lowest eigenstate of @xmath105 as : @xmath106 e^{\\alpha      a_{\\lambda}^\\dag}|0\\rangle.\\ ] ] since @xmath107 , by bch lemma eq .",
    "( [ repres1 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath108 and finally using eq .",
    "( [ def - creation ] ) we have @xmath109 where the imaginary part of @xmath100 is denoted by @xmath110 .",
    "since @xmath111 which is the usual css , we conclude that @xmath112 is identical to @xmath113 , up to a phase factor equal to @xmath114 , and therefore @xmath115 whenever @xmath116 ; a result that may be expected from the eigenvalue equation ( [ ani - def - nl ] ) .",
    "so obviously there is no problem with resolution of the identity @xmath117 we would like to emphasize that all we have down in this section is obtaining the explicit form of canonical cs in a deformed fock space @xmath118 , which in this case are nonorthogonal , and we called them new representation of canonical cs ( eq.([lambda - cs ] ) ) .",
    "in fact @xmath91 and @xmath113 belong to the same ray in the projective hilbert space ( we will explain more about this result in the appendix ) . as another result",
    "we conclude that by some particular superpositions of displaced exited coherent state @xmath44 ( which exhibit squeezing [ fu(2000 ) ] ) , we have obtained canonical css .",
    "we are able to consider the dynamical evolution of the @xmath11-css , in @xmath44 basis , which is simply obtained , because the spectrum of @xmath105 is the same as @xmath37 : @xmath119    \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\alpha^n}{\\sqrt{n!}}\\left ( l_n^{(0)}(-\\lambda    ^2)\\right)^{1/2}e^{-ih_\\lambda t}|n\\rangle_\\lambda   \\nonumber\\\\    & = & \\exp\\left[-\\lambda    \\re(\\alpha)-\\frac{|\\alpha^2|}{2}\\right ]    \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\alpha^n}{\\sqrt{n!}}\\left ( l_n^{(0)}(-\\lambda    ^2)\\right)^{1/2}e^{-i(n+\\frac{1}{2})t}|n\\rangle_\\lambda \\nonumber\\\\    & = & e^{-it/2}|\\alpha(t ) , \\lambda \\rangle,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used @xmath120 .",
    "this means that the time evolution of @xmath11-css in this nonorthogonal basis remain coherent for all times ( _ temporal stability _ ) .",
    "for standard cs @xmath113 , the occupation number distribution is poissonian @xmath121 whose mean and variance are equal to @xmath122 .",
    "similarly in the case of our @xmath11-css , we define : @xmath123 as the probability of finding the states @xmath124 in @xmath118 basis .",
    "it is easy to verify that @xmath125 . while the distribution in @xmath126 basis is poissonian , this is not so in @xmath127 basis . as usual",
    "we have : @xmath128 to check poissonian , sub - poissonian or supper - poissonian statistics , we can evaluate mandel parameter defined as : @xmath129 we see from figure ( 1 ) that the states @xmath130 exhibit sub - poissonian ( nonclassical ) or supper - poissonian statistic in @xmath44 basis depending on the values of @xmath100 . while it is seen that for @xmath131 the state is sub - poissonian , when @xmath132 it is supper - poissonian . as another feature , our numerical results show that when @xmath116 and @xmath133 for large values of @xmath134 , the statistical behavior of the state is nearly close to poissonian .",
    "according to the statement of a. i. solomon and j. katriel [ solomon(1990 ) ] , the conventional squeezed states are obtained by the action of a linear combination of creation and annihilation operators on an arbitrary state .",
    "now by generalizing this procedure to @xmath135 and @xmath136 of the deformed oscillator algebra with @xmath137 as annihilation and creation operators we have : @xmath138 this equation for @xmath139 leads to the squeezed vacuum states @xmath140^{\\frac{1}{2 } }     |2n\\rangle_\\lambda = c_0s(\\xi)|0\\rangle,\\ ] ] where the normalization coefficient may be determined as : @xmath141^{-\\frac{1}{2}},\\ ] ] and @xmath142 $ ] is the squeezed operator .",

    "`` new representation '' _ for squeezed state ( @xmath11-sss ) as : @xmath144 where @xmath145 is a disk centered at the origin in the complex @xmath146 plane with radius @xmath147 , which by a suitable transformation can be transformed to a unit disk . for",
    "the normalization factor one may get : @xmath148^{-\\frac{1}{2}}.\\ ] ] these @xmath11-sss are normalizable provided that the coefficients @xmath97 is nonzero and finite .",
    "it is very hard if not impossible , to obtain the analytic form of the radius of convergence for @xmath97 .",
    "this is due to the presence of three sigmas and two distinct parameters @xmath11 and @xmath146 in the series ( eq . [ coef ] ) .",
    "but this has been checked on the disk @xmath149 for a large value of @xmath11 and we obtained a finite radius of convergence for @xmath97 .",
    "but our investigations on numerical results shows that as @xmath11 increased , the radius of convergence reduced and this will confine the freedom of choosing @xmath11 .",
    "we see that these states are also even but in @xmath44 basis , although if we transform them by eq .",

    "the state @xmath153 in the standard fock space is the one which is named as squeezed coherent state . from the above discussion",
    "we immediately conclude that translating @xmath154 in @xmath155 basis to a state in the standard fock space @xmath79 does not coincide to the one we referred in eq .",
    "( [ ss ] ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that in obtaining the sss , both of the annihilation and deformed creation operators are contributed ( eq . [ sss ] ) . to check the nonclassical properties of these states",

    "only the @xmath157-quadrature is squeezed over all ranges of @xmath167 ( except near @xmath168 ) and the strength of squeezing is not so much sensible to the value of @xmath11 but depends on the values of @xmath167 . by increasing @xmath11-parameter , the squeezing transfer from @xmath157 to @xmath156-quadrature",
    "sooner and sooner with respect to the horizontal axis ( @xmath167 ) .",

    "the states proposed by j - beckers _ et al _ [ beckers(1998 ) ] ( or by h. fu",
    "_ et al_[fu(2000 ) ] ) @xmath175 are not coherent ones , but they exhibit squeezing .",
    "we showed that these states can be regarded as @xmath2-deformed coherent bound states and demonstrated that our infinite dimensional hilbert space may be spanned by them .",
    "our motivation for this consideration is the more generality and more flexibility of the nonorthogonal basis @xmath176 rather than orthogonal one @xmath177 .",
    "then we concluded that by some special superposition of the deformed fock space ( @xmath175 ) , we can obtain the representations of coherent state @xmath178 as well as squeezed coherent state @xmath162 in the new bases . in comparison of our new nonlinear - nonorthogonal but normalized fock space with basis @xmath44 and the orthonormal basis @xmath179 of the old fock space , it is worthable to note that the one we consider is not just a change of basis . by this",
    "we mean that there is a cut - off in the sum on the rhs of relation ( [ exp - nlamb - n ] ) .",

    "here we bring some examples to show that how the deformation of creation , annihilation or both of them for a specific dynamical system affect the produced css .",
    "we construct the hamiltonian @xmath180 before discussing the coherent states of this nonlinear hamiltonian , let us give some physical aspects for it . first it is obvious that @xmath181 which means that the states are not equally spaced . we know that a number of quantum mechanical systems e.g. square - well [ styer(2001 ) ] , morse potential [ morse(1926 ) ] and pschl - teller potential [ posh(1933 ) ] exhibit quadratic spectra @xmath182 , which indicate the nonlinearity nature of them . secondly we bring briefly the physical meaning of the above hamiltonian as manko _ et al _ proposed [ manko(1997 ) ] . for this purpose we may apply the inverse procedure they proposed , _ i.e. _ replacing creation and annihilation operators by complex variables @xmath100 and @xmath183 , after all we have @xmath184 where @xmath185 and @xmath186 and by @xmath187 we mean the poissonian bracket . therefore we obtain @xmath188 since @xmath189 is a constant of motion we conclude that the frequency of this nonlinear hamiltonian dynamics is @xmath190 this shows the number of particles dependence of new frequency , which is a nonlinear phenomena have been called by v. i. manko and g. tino _",
