    "future hadron colliders are expected to have high instantaneous luminosity  ( @xmath1  @xmath2  s@xmath3 ) and will operate for long data - taking periods , delivering to experiments large quantities of data  ( @xmath4  ab@xmath3 ) .",
    "this high - radiation environment sets stringent requirements on the radiation hardness of all detector parts , and on the components placed in the forward region in particular .",
    "a sampling calorimeter made of cerium fluoride  ( cef@xmath5 ) scintillating crystals , interleaved with tungsten plates , constitutes a viable option for forward electromagnetic calorimetry .",
    "cerium fluoride spontaneously recovers , at room temperature , from hadronic damage  @xcite , and its stoichiometry can be tuned in order to make it extremely resistant to ionizing radiation  @xcite .",
    "these features , together with the fact that its scintillation light has a spectrum which is suitable for wavelength shifting  ( the scintillation peak is around 340  nm ) and is fast enough for the high - repetition frequencies of modern colliders  ( it has a decay time of 30  ns ) , make cerium fluoride a very attractive active material .",
    "stemming from the design of a previously tested prototype  @xcite , a new design has been built , consisting of a single tower of 15 layers of alternating cef@xmath5 crystals and tungsten absorber plates .",
    "this article describes the results of irradiating this prototype with electrons of energies between 20 and 150  gev , produced by the cern super proton synchrotron  ( sps ) accelerator complex .",

    "a picture of the prototype during assembly can be seen in figure  [ fig : prototype ]  ( left ) .",
    "it is made of 15 layers of 10  mm - thick cef@xmath5 crystals , interleaved with 3.1  mm - thick tungsten absorber plates , for a total length of @xmath6 .",
    "the barium - doped cef@xmath5 crystals have been produced by tokuyama  @xcite , and their faces have been polished for total internal reflection . the module transverse dimension of @xmath7  mm@xmath8 matches the effective molire radius of the sampling compound , which is found to be 23.1  mm from a geant4  @xcite simulation .",
    "a higher granularity can be achieved by increasing the absorber fraction , at the cost of lower sampling fraction .",
    "four 3  mm - wide chamfers are cut on the short edges , allowing wavelength - shifting  ( wls ) fibres to run alongside the tower , transmitting the scintillation light to the back of the detector .",
    "the chamfers have been lapped to a roughness of @xmath9  @xmath10 m , so as to allow the light to escape the crystals and be collected by the wls fibres .",
    "a 0.2  mm layer of highly - diffusive duponttyvek^^  @xcite foil is inserted between each crystal and its neighboring absorber plates , in order to maximise the light collection of the fibres .    in this beam test",
    "four 3hf fibres produced by kuraray  @xcite have been employed .",
    "the fibres have a peak excitation of 340  nm , compatible with the emission spectrum of the cef@xmath5 , and an emission peak at 540  nm .",
    "the fibres have a single 0.02  mm layer of cladding made of polymethyl methacrylate  ( pmma ) surrounding the core of polystyrene .",
    "one end is coupled with optical couplant to a hamamatsu  @xcite r1450 photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) at the rear end ; the other end is aluminized .",
    "the quantum efficiency of the pmts for the light emitted by the fibres has been measured to be about 7% .",
    "the radiation hardness of these fibres is not sufficient for future applications at the hl - lhc , therefore r&d targeted at developing radiation - hard fibres is currently ongoing .    for lateral shower containment ,",
    "the w - cef@xmath5 prototype has been surrounded by 24 bgo crystals , to complete a @xmath11 matrix .",
    "the bgo crystals have been taken from the disassembly of the electromagnetic calorimeter of the l3 experiment  @xcite operating at lep , and are 24  cm long and have a front face of @xmath12  mm@xmath8 and a rear face of @xmath13  mm@xmath8 .",
    "the light from each bgo crystal is read out with a hamamatsu r1450 pmt .",
    "a photograph of the front of the assembled @xmath14 matrix is found in figure  [ fig : prototype ]  ( right ) .",
    "the matrix was put in a light - tight box , and kept at a temperature of @xmath15  c. the box was placed on a moving table , which allowed to center the beam anywhere on the matrix , with a precision of 0.1  mm .",
    "the fibre signals were then read out by a caen v1742 digitizer @xcite , while the bgos were read out by a caen v792 adc .",
    "the digitizer gives access to the full pulse - shape of the signal , which is stored in 1024 samples , at a frequency of 5  ghz .",
    "the width of the readout window allowed a baseline subtraction on a per - event basis . a low - pass filter , which was found to reduce high - frequency noise present in the signal and improve the stability of the measurement , was applied to the output of the digitizer .",
    "the channel response is defined as the full charge - integrated signal , after the baseline subtraction .",
    "the high - energy electrons from the h4 beam at the cern sps north area are tracked before hitting the front face of the w - cef@xmath5 prototype : a wire - chamber  ( placed at 12  m from the channel ) , two scintillating - fibre hodoscopes  ( at 6 and 3  m , respectively ) , and a small hodoscope , just in front of tower front face .",
    "the wire chamber is made of two planes of 55 cathode wires and 28 anode wires , organized in a grid with an active area of @xmath16  mm@xmath8 .",
    "each plane provides , respectively , a measurement of the electron position in the @xmath17 and @xmath18 directions with a nominal resolution better than 200  @xmath10 m  @xcite .",
    "each of the two scintillating - fibre hodoscopes is composed of two layers of 64 plastic fibres of 0.5 mm diameter , oriented in the @xmath17 and @xmath18 directions , respectively .",
    "the signals from the fibres are clustered grouping together adjacent fibres , up to a maximum of 4 fibres per cluster .",
    "the cluster position is defined as the average position of its fibres and it is used to estimate the trajectory of the particle before impacting the calorimeter .    finally , a small @xmath19  mm@xmath8 hodoscope is placed in front of the calorimeter front face , and aligned with the center of the cef@xmath5 module .",
    "this hodoscope is made of two pairs of 1-mm fibres , again oriented in the @xmath20 directions .",
    "being fixed to the calorimeter box , this small hodoscope is used to align the center of the tower front face with respect to the tracking detectors : events are selected in which the particle produces a signal in one of the two fibres of the small hodoscope , and the average recorded position is measured in each of the other three tracking devices .",
    "the average position measured by each tracking device is then used as an alignment offset , and is subtracted from subsequent measurements .",
    "this is done separately for each beam energy .",
    "after the alignment procedure the hodoscopes and the wire chamber are aligned within 0.5  mm .",
    "four plastic scintillators of varying size , the smallest of which has a transverse dimension of @xmath21  cm@xmath8 , are placed on the beamline .",
    "the data acquisition is triggered by the coincidence of all four scintillators .",
    "beam electrons are found to most likely produce 2-fibre clusters .",
    "electrons hitting upstream material will produce particle showers before hitting the tower ; these events are vetoed by selecting only events which registered hodoscope activity compatible with the passage of one electron .",
    "it is also additionally required that electrons are parallel to the beam line by requiring that the position reconstruction of the wire chamber and the far hodoscope are within 4  mm of each other , and that the positions measured in the two hodoscope planes lie within 1.5  mm .",
    "the reconstructed impact position of the electron on the calorimeter is taken as the average of the positions measured by the two hodoscopes .     and",
    "gaussian width  @xmath23 of the fitted function are shown .",
    "[ fig : crystalball],scaledwidth=49.0% ]",
    "a full simulation of the experimental setup has been implemented within the geant4 framework .",
    "the w - cef@xmath5 channel description has a realistic geometry of the cef@xmath5 , tungsten , and the fibres .",
    "the bgo crystals are approximated by 22  mm  @xmath24  22  mm  @xmath24  24  cm parallelepipeds .",
    "the hodoscopes and scintillators along the beam line are approximated with blocks of pmma with the corresponding sizes .",
    "the simulated response of the channel is taken as the sum of the energy deposited in the active material , and each layer is weighted by the relative light yield difference of the 15 crystals , which has been measured in the laboratory with a radioactive source , and found to have a spread of 9% .",
    "the simulation automatically takes into account resolution effects due to stochastic shower fluctuations and lateral containment . an additional term to include photostatistics , determined by the _ in situ _ absolute photoelectron calibration from cosmic muons , is added in quadrature .",
    "in addition to the experimental setup , an additional setup , consisting of a @xmath14 matrix of w - cef@xmath5 towers , has been simulated .",
    "this allows for a more realistic description of the lateral leakage and for an extrapolation to future calorimetric applications .",

    "the response of the four read - out channels of the prototype is intercalibrated in order to take into account differences in the gains and quantum efficiencies of the pmts .",
    "this is done by selecting events where electrons impinge on a narrow @xmath25  mm strip passing through the center of the front face , alternatively in the @xmath17 and @xmath18 directions , and studying the variation of the response of each single read - out channel as a function of the electron impact position along that strip .",
    "the inverse of the response at the center of the strip is taken as intercalibration factor , and the two factors obtained in the @xmath17 and @xmath18 directions are averaged .",
    "the resulting intercalibration factors are applied as a multiplicative , relative , correction .",
    "the four calibration factors are found to be within 10% of unity .",
    "the response of the w - cef@xmath5 channel is defined through a fit to the sum of the inter - calibrated signals recorded by the four fibres .",
    "the adopted fit function is a crystal ball  @xcite , to model the low - energy response tail .",
    "an example fit , for 100  gev electrons , can be seen in figure  [ fig : crystalball ] .",
    "the resolution of the tracking devices on the beam allows for a precise study of the prototype s response as a function of the electron impact point on the front face .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : resp_ff ] for 50  gev  ( left ) and 100  gev  ( right ) electrons .",
    "the nominal position of the channel s front face is overlayed as a yellow frame , and the agreement with the observed response profile is proof of a successful alignment .",
    "furthermore , the response is found to be quite uniform across the channel s front face .",
    "figure  [ fig : resp_vs_mc ] shows instead the response profile as a function of the beam impact position , projected along the @xmath17  ( left ) and @xmath18  ( right ) directions , respectively for data  ( solid markers ) and the simulation  ( open markers ) .",
    "the simulation does not include ray tracing and light collection effect .",
    "nevertheless the difference between the data and simulation is at most 5% , so we can conclude that the effect of light collection in the four fibers is smaller than 5% in this configuration . in order to minimize the effect of lateral containment fluctuations , for the resolution studies that follow , events impacting the central @xmath26  mm@xmath8 area of the channel front face have been selected .",
    "the resolution of the response distribution @xmath27 is defined as the ratio between the mean and the width of the gaussian core of the crystal ball fit . to extract the energy resolution @xmath28 of the w - cef@xmath5 tower ,",
    "it is necessary to disentagle ( i ) pmt saturation effects  ( present at high voltage settings ) and ( ii ) pmt noise  ( present at low voltage settings ) .",
    "because of the dependence of both effects on the high voltage applied to the pmts , in situ voltage scans have been taken at different beam energies .     as a function of the response , for beam energies of 20  gev  ( squares ) , 50  gev  ( circles ) , 100  gev  ( stars ) and 150  gev  ( crosses )",
    ". the results of the fits are superimposed .",
    "[ fig : sigma_vs_r],scaledwidth=49.0% ]    the result of these scans is shown in figure  [ fig : sigma_vs_r ] , where @xmath27 is studied as a function of the mean response @xmath29 , for beam energies of 20  gev  ( squares ) , 50  gev  ( circles ) , 100  gev  ( stars ) and 150  gev  ( crosses ) .",
    "the points are fitted with the function : @xmath30 where the first term describes pmt noise and is governed by the parameter  @xmath31 which is fitted simultaneously to all energy response scans , and the second term is the instrinsic energy resolution , at a given energy .",
    "the results of the fits are superimposed in figure  [ fig : sigma_vs_r ] .",
    "the uncertainties of the points shown in figure  [ fig : sigma_vs_r ] include a systematic uncertainty related to the choice of the functional form chosen to fit the response distributions , which has been evaluated separately for each energy , and reaches a maximum value of 20% at the lowest energy point .    in order to limit the effect of pmt saturation , which manifests itself at high response , the fitting range is limited to @xmath32  adc channels .",
    "the fit is repeated twice , with an upper limit of @xmath33 and @xmath34  adc channels , respectively , and the maximal variation in @xmath28 is taken as a systematic uncertainty on the choice of the fitting range .",
