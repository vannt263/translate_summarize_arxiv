    "<S> we compare several methods for the efficient generation of correlated random sequences ( colored noise ) by filtering white noise to achieve a desired correlation spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that a class of iir filter - design techniques developed in the 1970s , which obtain the global chebyshev - optimum minimum - phase filter with a desired magnitude and arbitrary phase , are uniquely suited for this problem but have seldom been used . </S>",
    "<S> the short filters that result from such techniques are crucial for applications of colored noise in physical simulations involving random processes , for which many long random sequences must be generated and computational time and memory are at a premium .    </S>",
    "<S> the generation of correlated random sequences , or `` colored noise '' , is important for many physical simulations involving random processes  @xcite , and often the required computational time and memory is a critical concern . </S>",
    "<S> although many filter - based techniques have been applied to this problem  @xcite , in this brief manuscript we point out that these methods are suboptimal : a global chebyshev - optimum stable iir filter for this problem may be designed based on techniques developed in the 1970s  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> colored - noise generation is required for many types of numerical simulations , such as thermodynamics  @xcite , laser noise and first - passage time problems  @xcite , and chaotic dynamics  @xcite . in general , any numerical model involving stochastic differential equations </S>",
    "<S> in which there is some background distribution , nonlinearity , or external noise associated with the quantities driving the fluctuations will require the use of colored noise  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such colored noise is most commonly described by a _ linear process _ : the output of a time - invariant linear filter applied to white noise  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the key implementation question , as we discuss below , is to determine how to apply this filter process . with rare exceptions  @xcite , the underlying random process is almost always gaussian in nature , if it arises by a physical process governed by the central - limit theorem  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is this nearly ubiquitous case that we focus on here , in which only the correlation function of zero - mean colored noise is of concern , and not any higher - order statistics .    from a computational standpoint , </S>",
    "<S> the central problem is that many of these applications require many random sequences to be generated in parallel , and/or very long sequences , imposing performance and memory constraints on the noise generation . </S>",
    "<S> this occurs , for example , in the generation of power - law ( @xmath0 ) `` pink noise '' for applications ranging from hydrology to music , where very long sequences ( whose length may not be known _ a priori _ ) are often required @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> multiple long random sequences also occur in the generation of rayleigh random variates for simulation of nonisotropic scattering , macrocellular systems , and physical models of mobile multipath radio channels  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> perhaps the most stringent requirements for colored - noise generation occur for spatio - temporal noise : where a different random sequence may need to be generated simultaneously for every point in space . </S>",
    "<S> this occurs , for example , in modeling of brownian motion  @xcite , or for simulation of thermal radiation  @xcite .     </S>",
    "<S> vs. @xmath1 ( red ) . </S>",
    "<S> the periodogram ( spectrum ) of a finite - length correlated random sequence generated by the methods in this paper is also shown ( black ) , computed by bartlett s method  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the fundamental technique for generating correlated random sequences is to start with white noise ( uncorrelated random numbers ) and to apply a filter whose power spectrum matches the desired correlation spectrum  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> that is , suppose that we want colored - noise @xmath2 with some desired correlation function @xmath3 , the ( discrete - time ) fourier transform of which is the correlation spectrum @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we then start with white noise @xmath5 , usually uncorrelated gaussian random numbers , with zero mean and @xmath6 , and apply a filter @xmath7 : in frequency domain , @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the desired correlation spectrum is achieved if @xmath9 .    </S>",
    "<S> although this filtering operation can be performed entirely in the frequency domain via a fast fourier transform ( fft ) of the data sequences  @xcite , such an approach is often too inefficient . </S>",
    "<S> filtering entirely in the frequency domain requires the entire data sequence @xmath2 to be computed and stored in advance , and if many long sequences are required the storage becomes prohibitive . </S>",
    "<S> the alternative is to perform the filtering in the time domain , using either finite - impulse response ( fir ) filters or infinite - impulse response ( iir ) filters ( also called recursive or arma filters ) . since the generation of colored noise is of interest to many researchers without a background in signal processing , </S>",
    "<S> let us briefly review the basics of fir and iir filtering , which are covered in more detail by numerous textbooks , e.g.  ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> fir filters consist of a finite - length sequence @xmath10 that is convolved with the @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the fourier transform of the @xmath10 is the filter @xmath7 , but in general a finite - length sequence can only approximate an arbitrary desired spectrum @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , an fir filter yields a spectrum @xmath7 which is a polynomial in @xmath11 with coefficients @xmath10 . a better approximation may be obtained by generalizing to a ratio of two polynomials ( i.e. , rational functions ) , which leads to iir filters . </S>",
    "<S> an iir filter is determined by two finite - length sequences , @xmath12 ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) and @xmath10 ( @xmath15 ) , that determine @xmath2 via the recurrence ( which can be written in several equivalent forms ) : @xmath16 that is , @xmath2 is a convolution of @xmath10 with @xmath5 and of @xmath12 with the previous values of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the filter design problem is then , given filter orders @xmath17 and @xmath18 , to find the @xmath12 and @xmath10 that best approximate the desired spectrum .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we must choose what type of filter to apply ( iir or fir ) and a filter - design method . </S>",
    "<S> several choices have been previously proposed in the context of colored - noise generation . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest method , as we mentioned above , is to just perform a fast fourier transform ( fft ) of the entire desired spectrum multiplied by random phases  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is equivalent to an fir filter of the same length as the data , designed by the `` window '' method  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one can also employ fir filters of shorter lengths , designed by a variety of standard methods such as parks - mcclellan  @xcite . for certain noise problems </S>",
    "<S> , an fir filter may also be designed by analytical methods  @xcite . in order to shorten the length of the required filter , and thus the memory and time requirements , iir </S>",
    "<S> recursive filters have been proposed  @xcite . in general , the design of iir filters is a difficult problem  @xcite , and past approaches to colored noise generation by iir filtering have used local - optimization  @xcite or yule - walker methods  @xcite that are not guaranteed to yield the global - optimum filter coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> another difficulty is that not all iir - filter design techniques are guaranteed to yield a stable filter ( one which does not lead to a diverging process ) . </S>",
    "<S> one important exception is exponentially correlated noise , for which an exact first - order iir filter is known analytically and is commonly used ( although typically derived from a stochastic differential equation @xmath19 and not recognized as an iir filter _ per se _ )  @xcite . however , there is a key property of the iir filter design problem for colored - noise generation that makes optimal filter design practical : the phase of the filter @xmath7 is irrelevant , since it is multiplied in any case by white noise @xmath20 with a random phase .    </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we can exploit results by dudgeon  @xcite and rabiner  @xcite , who demonstrated that the _ global _ chebyshev - optimum magnitude - only minimum - phase stable iir filter - design problem can be efficiently solved by a sequence of linear - programming problems  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> alternative methods with similar properties have also been proposed  @xcite , and the dudgeon and rabiner technique was recently generalized to multidimensional iir filters  @xcite . however </S>",
    "<S> , its applicability to the problem of colored - noise generation does not seem to have been appreciated , and in this manuscript we demonstrate that it can yield dramatically more efficient filters than previous approaches .    to demonstrate the efficacy of the various filter - design approaches for colored - noise generation , we consider an example drawn from thermodynamic simulations of gray - body thermal radiation  @xcite . in this problem , thermal effects are modeled as random fluctuating current sources everywhere in space , with a correlation spectrum  @xmath21 , for a constant @xmath22 determined by the temperature , based on the planck distribution . </S>",
    "<S> this distribution is shown in fig .  1 , along with the periodogram of a finite - length correlated random sequence generated by the methods in this paper .    </S>",
    "<S> an iir filter is defined by a rational polynomial function in @xmath11 : @xmath23 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 define the filter order and @xmath24 for convenience . </S>",
    "<S> a stable minimum - phase iir filter has all of its poles and zeros within the unit circle in @xmath25 ( i.e. , for @xmath26 )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> given a sequence of uncorrelated random numbers @xmath5 , the output colored - noise sequence @xmath2 is then given by the recurrence ( eq . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) above . </S>",
    "<S> the required memory , along with the computation time per output , is therefore @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> an fir filter is the special case @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> a sequence @xmath2 of length @xmath29 from an fir filter can be generated in @xmath30 time instead of @xmath31 by use of fast fourier transforms ( via overlap - add or overlap - save techniques  @xcite ) , but the memory requirements are not improved .    , </S>",
    "<S> vs. @xmath32 for the planck distribution @xmath4 given in fig .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> the chebychev error is plotted for six different filter methods : iir yule - walker ( red squares ) , fir parks - mcclellan ( black crosses ) , fir least - squares ( blue dots ) , iir global - optimum filter ( gray circles ) , and two nonlinear conjugate - gradient methods optimizing two different @xmath33 norms : ( a ) @xmath34 ( green diamonds ) and ( b ) @xmath35 ( magenta triangles ) . , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    [ fig : abserr ]    in fig .  2 , we plot the @xmath36 ( chebyshev ) error , @xmath37 , as a function of the total filter order @xmath32 , for filters @xmath7 designed by several techniques . </S>",
    "<S> ( here , we employ the chebyshev error over the entire frequency bandwidth ; for other applications , only a subset of the bandwidth may be of interest . ) the best method , i.e. smallest _ chebychev error _ for any given - order , is the optimal magnitude - only iir filter design ( implemented using the differential - correction algorithm  @xcite ) . the other design methods plotted consist of two fir and two iir filter techniques . </S>",
    "<S> the two linear - phase fir filter techniques are ( from the matlab signal - processing toolbox ) : first , the parks - mcclellan algorithm , which finds the global chebyshev optimum  @xcite ( black ) ; second , a least - squares fir optimization ( blue ) , as described in ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> the two iir filter designs plotted are : first , a nonlinear conjugate - gradient minimization of a least - squares norm proposed by  ref .  , and suggested by  ref .   for use in generation of rayleigh - correlated noise ( green diamonds ) ; second , another ( non - global ) optimization technique based on the modified yule - walker algorithm in the matlab signal - processing toolbox  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the conjugate - gradient method only finds a local optimum , and is highly sensitive to the starting point of the optimization for this problem  @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> , we use the yule - walker iir filter as the starting point , and conjugate gradient is able to improve upon it significantly ( in fact , it happens to nearly match the parks - mcclellan fir performance ) . </S>",
    "<S> we examined the conjugate - gradient minimization of two different @xmath33 norms [ @xmath38 of the error : @xmath39  @xcite and @xmath35 , although it turns out to make little difference in the result .     </S>",
    "<S> error , @xmath34 , vs. @xmath32 for the planck distribution @xmath4 given in fig .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath34 error is plotted for six different filter methods : iir yule - walker ( red squares ) , fir parks - mcclellan ( black crosses ) , fir least - squares ( blue dots ) , iir global - optimum filter ( gray circles ) , and two nonlinear conjugate - gradient methods optimizing two different @xmath33 norms : ( a ) @xmath34 ( green diamonds ) and ( b ) @xmath35 ( magenta triangles).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    [ fig : l2a ]     error , @xmath40 , vs. @xmath32 for the planck distribution @xmath4 given in fig .  1 . the @xmath35 error is plotted for six different filter methods : iir yule - walker ( red squares ) , fir parks - mcclellan ( black crosses ) , fir least - square ( blue dots ) , iir global - optimum filter ( gray circles ) , and two nonlinear conjugate - gradient methods optimizing two different @xmath33 norms : ( a ) @xmath34 ( green diamonds ) and ( b ) @xmath35 ( magenta triangles).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    [ fig : l2b ]    we suspect that the chebyshev norm is typically the most appropriate one for physical simulations involving random processes . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that a large error in a narrow bandwidth , which might be allowed by a least - square ( @xmath33 ) norm , could result in a spectral feature that might be mistaken for a spurious physical phenomenon ; a large `` spike '' in error may also interact adversely with nonlinearities in the physics . nevertheless , in fig .  3 and fig .  4 , </S>",
    "<S> we show two different @xmath33 errors , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , for the same filter designs as in fig .  2 , and </S>",
    "<S> the results demonstrate that the chebychev - optimal iir filter is at least comparable , and often superior to , the other methods , even in norms that it does not strictly optimize </S>",
    "<S> . in particular , the @xmath35 norm of the chebyshev - optimum iir filter does better than all other local optimization techniques for most @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> further gains could potentially be made , if this is the desired error norm , by starting with the chebyshev filter and then performing a local optimization by some other method . </S>"
