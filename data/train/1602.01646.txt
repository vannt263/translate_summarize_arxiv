    "an analytic description of propagators and vertices of yang - mills theories at the nonperturbative level , in a given gauge is a possible starting point for understanding the relevant features of these theories and , in particular , the phenomenon of color confinement @xcite . from this point of view , the first natural step is the study of the infrared ( ir ) behavior of the gluon propagator @xmath3 and of the ghost propagator @xmath0 as functions of the momentum @xmath4 . in the last thirty years , many numerical and analytic studies have addressed this issue in landau gauge , in two , three and four space - time dimensions ( see , for example , the reviews @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "the two different types of solutions can also be related to the gribov - zwanziger ( gz ) @xcite and refined gz ( rgz ) @xcite approaches , which correspond respectively to the scaling and to the massive behaviors for the gluon and ghost propagators in the deep ir limit .    in refs .",
