    "elastic wave propagation in periodic structures referred to as _ phononic crystals _ ( pc ) has been the subject of intensive research over the last few years @xcite .",
    "composed of elastic centers ( _ e . g. _",
    "cylinders , in the two - dimensional case ) embedded in a matrix of a different elastic material and disposed in nodes of a crystal lattice , phononic crystals show in their band structure energy gaps forbidden to elastic wave propagation . due to this property",
    ", these structures have extensive practical applications , especially as so - called acoustic screens , suppressing waves from a given frequency range @xcite .",
    "for this reason , it is important to know how to design structures with the phononic gap as wide as possible .    beside the physical properties of the pc crystal component materials ,",
    "the phononic gap width is found to depend strongly on the lattice symmetry , as well as on the scatterer shape @xcite .",
    "this dependence is a common feature of phononic and photonic crystals @xcite . in both crystals",
    ", the gap width depends also on the rod orientation with respect to the lattice , and thus on the relative orientation of the rods as well @xcite .",
    "the effect of scatterer shape and symmetry on the phononic band gap in two - dimensional solid phononic crystals has recently been studied by w.kuang _",
    "_ @xcite ; the investigated structures consisted of steel rods embedded in epoxy , and thus represented the case of high - density rods in a low - density matrix only . three types of lattice ( triangular , hexagonal and square ) and four different scatterer shapes ( hexagon , circle , square and triangle ) were considered . for a given lattice symmetry ,",
    "the absolute phononic band gap width was found to be the largest when the shape and orientation of the scatterers corresponded to those of the lattice .",
    "besides , for a given scatterer shape , the gap was found to be the broadest when the lattice had the largest coordination number , as the crystal symmetries in this case were not reduced by the scatterers .",
    "also , the band gap was shown to be controllable by adjusting the scatterer orientation and size : the normalized gap width was found to increase as a result of scatterer rotation if the latter caused the maximum allowed filling fraction to increase ; otherwise the normalized gap width would be reduced .",
    "the aim of this study is to show the effect of rod and matrix material parameters ( the mass density , in particular ) on the relation between the energy gap width and the symmetry of the scatterers and the crystal lattice in two - dimensional phononic crystals .",
    "this objective will be realized by investigating the dependence of the gap width on the rod symmetry , with the rods embedded in different sorts of lattice ; the two cases : high - density rods in low - density matrix , and low - density rods in high - density matrix , will be considered separately .",
    "four composite types will be examined first : steel / epoxy , c / epoxy , pb / epoxy and duralumin / epoxy , the epoxy component being always the matrix .",
    "inverse structures , _",
    "i.e. _ epoxy / steel , epoxy / c , epoxy / pb and epoxy / duralumin , representing the case of low - density rods in a high - density matrix , will be investigated in the next step .",
    "phononic band gaps will be studied in two - dimensional solid phononic crystals differing in lattice symmetry and rod shape .",
    "specifically , three types of lattice : square ( _ sq _ ) , triangular ( _ tr _ ) and rectangular ( _ rc _ ) , and four different scatterer shapes : circle ( c ) , hexagon ( hx ) , square ( sq ) and rectangle ( rc ) , will be considered .",
    "the rod orientation with respect to the lattice is fixed , the symmetry axes of the rods corresponding to those of the crystal lattice with the same symmetry , the configuration allowing to generate the broadest energy gaps in phononic crystals composed of two solids @xcite . in our investigation of elastic wave propagation in these structures , @xmath0 modes ( polarized in the wave propagation plane ) and @xmath1 modes (",
    "polarized in the direction perpendicular to the wave propagation ) will be examined separately . the effect of rod and matrix material parameters , especially the density ratio between the rod material and the matrix material , on the relation between the energy gap width and the lattice and rod symmetry proves to be substantial for both @xmath1 and @xmath0 modes .",
    "the paper is divided into four sections . in section 2",
    ", we describe the plane wave ( pw ) method used in the band structure calculation ; the numerical results , as well as a table of material parameters , are presented in section 3 ; the results are discussed in section 4 .",
    "the phononic band structure is calculated through the elastic medium wave equation , solved with the use of the plane wave method @xcite .",
    "the plane wave method consists in transforming a differential wave equation , whose coefficients are periodic functions of two - dimensional position vector @xmath2 , into the reciprocal space . for a nonhomogeneous elastic medium the wave equation reads @xcite : @xmath3+\\nabla \\cdot \\left[\\rho ( \\vec{r})c_{t}^{2}(\\vec{r } )",

    ", the gaps obtained in each of the phononic crystals covered by table [ tab.3 ] are found to be the broadest in structures in which the symmetry of the rods corresponds exactly to that of the lattice , which confirms the results reported in @xcite .",
    "the results obtained in the case of triangular lattice can be expressed by the following inequality , for both @xmath1 and @xmath0 modes : @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the gap width in the square - rod composite , @xmath143 is the corresponding value in the cylinder - rod structure , @xmath144 denotes the gap width in the composite with hexagonal rods and @xmath145 refers to the case of rectangular rods .",
    "the results obtained in the case of square lattice , for both @xmath1 and @xmath0 modes , can be expressed as follows : @xmath146 in the case of rectangular lattice , the results obtained can not be expressed by just one inequality ; however , the broadest gaps are found to appear for rectangular rods .",
    "the results obtained for steel / epoxy , c / epoxy and duralumin / epoxy structures are qualitatively the same ; in the case of @xmath1 modes , all the weak inequalities in ( [ omega1 ] ) and ( [ omega2 ] ) can be replaced with strict ones .",
    "however , the results obtained for pb / epoxy are different : as long as the lattice type is fixed , gaps appearing at various rod shapes ( cylindrical , hexagonal and square ) are found to be equal .",
    "the optimum filling fraction value lies within the range from @xmath147 to @xmath148 in each of the first three cases , but is found to be below @xmath149 , and thus relatively low , in the case of the pb / epoxy composition ; this means that the matrix material is then the dominant one in the pb / epoxy crystal .",
    "the described properties of the energy gap width in the pb / epoxy crystal are due to different contrasts of longitudinal and transversal velocity values in the component materials : the relations between the @xmath5 and @xmath4 values in the rods and in the matrix are reversed with respect to the other compositions ( @xmath150 and @xmath151 ) , while the density relation is the same ( @xmath152 ) . the gaps are found to be narrowest in the c / epoxy composite , due to the lowest density contrast , @xmath153 , between the component materials .      in order to check whether the results discussed above depend on the rod and matrix density values , similar computations of the phononic gap width values for different rod symmetries were performed for epoxy / steel , epoxy / c , epoxy / pb and epoxy / duralumin crystals , representing the case of low - density rods in a high - density matrix . providing an example , figure [ rys.3](b ) shows the reduced frequency plotted against the filling fraction on the basis of the results obtained in the epoxy / steel crystal with cylindrical rods embedded in a square lattice .    in figure [ rys.6 ]",
    "the gap width is plotted against the rod shape in steel / epoxy and epoxy / steel crystals ( figure [ rys.6 ] ( a ) and ( b ) ) as well as in pb / epoxy and epoxy / pb crystals ( figure [ rys.6 ] ( c ) and ( d ) ) ; @xmath1 and @xmath0 modes are considered separately ( figure [ rys.6 ] ( a),(c ) and [ rys.6 ] ( b),(d ) , respectively ) .",
    "the plots obtained for the remaining two compositions , _ i.e. _ for c / epoxy and duralumin / epoxy , are qualitatively the same as those obtained for the steel / epoxy crystal , and thus are not depicted in the figures presented in this paper .",
    "the plots shown in figure [ rys.6 ] indicate clearly that , regardless of polarization , relations ( [ omega1])-([omega2 ] ) , obtained for crystals with high - density rods in a low - density matrix ( represented by the solid lines ) , do not apply to the inverse structures ( dashed lines ) , in which the density of the rod material is lower that that of the matrix .",
    "in triangular lattice - based crystals , hexagonal rods are found to generate narrower gaps than cylindrical or square rods . in square lattice - based structures ,",
    "square rods are found to generate no gaps at all ( though other rod shapes do generate them ) ; also in rectangular lattice - based structures no gaps are generated by rectangular rods .",
    "therefore , the inversion of the material composition clearly implies a radical change in the relations between the gap width and the scatterer symmetry : in none of the cases considered , for a given lattice type , the broadest gaps are found to appear when the symmetry of the rods corresponds to that of the lattice .",
    "besides , the gaps obtained in such inverse structures are much narrower ( four times in the epoxy / steel crystal , and twice in the epoxy / pb structure ) than those observed in the corresponding crystal with high - density rods in a low - density matrix .",
    "as similar results were obtained for all the compositions considered ( also in the epoxy / pb crystal , with different longitudinal and transversal velocity contrasts ) , the strongest impact on the considered relations can be expected to come from the mass density .",
    "as indicated by the results presented in the preceding section , covering two classes of phononic crystals : those with high - density rods embedded in a low - density matrix , and those with low - density rods in a high - density matrix , material parameter values have much of an impact on the relation between the energy gap width and the lattice and rod symmetry ; the effect of the mass density was found to be especially significant . in structures with high - density rods in a low - density matrix , the gaps are found to be the broadest when the symmetry of the rods corresponds to that of the lattice , i.e. for hexagonal rods in triangular lattice - based crystals , square rods in square lattice - based crystals , and rectangular rods in rectangular lattice - based crystals , as already demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "however , this rule will cease to apply when the density of the rod material becomes lower than that of the matrix . in this case , when the symmetry of the rods corresponds to that of the lattice , gaps either fail to appear at all , or are much narrower than in other configurations .",
    "gaps obtained in such inverse structures are always much narrower than those appearing in crystals with high - density rods in a low - density matrix .",
    "this is due to the fact that low - density rods embedded in a high - density matrix are weak scattering centers : their wave scattering effect is hardly noticeable and much lesser than that produced by high - density rods in a low - density matrix . as regards the longitudinal and transversal velocity values ( @xmath5 and @xmath4 ) in the component materials , the effect of these parameters on the investigated relations proves less significant .",
