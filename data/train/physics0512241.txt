    "these studies have subsequently suggested the choice of stochastic models to explain complex behavior observed in synthetic and natural data sets @xcite .",
    "the objective of the present study is to understand the scaling behavior of the first - order stochastic processes and their volatility series @xcite as function of the process parameter .",
    "based on the results obtained for the various parameter regime , we evaluate the choice of these processes in modeling real - world temperature data @xcite .",
    "classical ar ( 1 ) is given by the expression @xmath1 where @xmath2 represents independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d ) gaussian innovations with zero mean and unit variance .",
    "the corresponding volatility series of ( 1 ) is given by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 represents the absolute value of @xmath5 .",
    "correlations in @xmath6 imply that clusters of ( small ) big changes are likely to be followed by clusters of ( small ) big changes .",
    "it can be shown analytically that eqn .",
    "( 1 ) is stationary when @xmath7 i.e. @xmath8 .",
    "the autocorrelation function ( acf ) of ( 1 ) decays exponentially and is of the form @xmath9 for lag @xmath10 .",
    "the nature of the decay is governed by the process parameter @xmath0 .",
    "while @xmath11 exhibits an exponential decay for ( @xmath12 ) , it exhibits an exponential decay with oscillations for ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath14 and @xmath15 represent cases where the current sample is negatively and positively correlated with its immediate past , respectively .",
    "the strength of the short - term correlated and short - term anti - correlated behavior is dictated by the process parameter @xmath0 .",
    "we also consider the case where @xmath2 in ( 1 ) is generated by a long - range correlated gaussian process @xcite . this extended ar ( 1 ) with long - range correlated gaussian innovations shall be referred to as car ( 1 ) in the subsequent sections .",
    "the choice of the term car was encouraged by recent studies @xcite . in the light of recent findings",

    "a similar analysis was carried for process @xmath25 fig .",
    "unlike @xmath26 whose fluctuation function is relatively homogenous , characteristic crossovers are observed for @xmath27 and their volatility series , fig .",
    "1b . for @xmath28 , the log - log plot of the ar ( 1 ) process displayed correlated behavior at short - time scales and uncorrelated behavior at the larger time scales @xmath29 .",
    "however , for @xmath30 , one observes a characteristic crossover from anti - correlated behavior for time scales @xmath31 to uncorrelated behavior for @xmath32 .",
    "the volatility series for @xmath28 was homogenous and exhibited an exponent of @xmath33 characteristic of monofractal data @xcite , whereas that of @xmath30 , displayed a marked crossover from correlated to uncorrelated behavior .",
    "_ from the above discussion , it is clear that the process parameter @xmath0 has a significance impact on the scaling behavior at shorter time scales .",
    "this is reflected by marked distortions and cross - overs in the fluctuation plots .",
    "it can also be noted that irrespective of the choice of @xmath0 , the scaling in the asymptotic regime resembles that of an uncorrelated noise , @xmath17_.      long - range correlated gaussian innovations @xmath2 with scaling exponent of ( @xmath34 ) @xcite was used to generate car ( 1 ) .",
    "the fluctuation function of car ( 1 ) process for @xmath35 were parallel to each other and to @xmath2 ( @xmath34 ) , see fig .",
    "the corresponding volatility series displayed an exponent of 0.5 characteristic of monofractal data .",
    "thus the scaling behavior of car ( 1 ) is similar to that of ar ( 1 ) for process parameter @xmath0 close to zero .    for @xmath30 ,",

    "short time scales had an exponent @xmath39 close to the integrated version of @xmath2 ( @xmath34 ) .",

    "fluctuation function obtained for the volatility series ( @xmath38 ) was parallel to the reference line with slope 0.5 characteristic of monofractal data .",
    "however , the fluctuation function of the volatility series ( @xmath40 ) displayed correlated behavior at short time scales @xmath41 and uncorrelated behavior @xmath42 in the asymptotic regime .",

    "[ [ critical - note - on - the - choice - of - car-1-to - model - temperature - correlations ] ] critical note on the choice of car ( 1 ) to model temperature correlations ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    it has been shown @xcite that atmospheric temperature data ( from a randomly chosen 14 continental regions ) display power correlations with dfa exponent @xmath43 and this is considered as universal persistence behavior of the temperature data . using this result as a benchmark ,",
    "the quality of the temperature data simulated by the global climate models has been evaluated @xcite . in a later study @xcite",
    "it has been shown that temperature data from continental and costal zones display lesser deviations from the previously observed universal behavior ( exponent ) of 0.65 while the islands display greater variability with the average exponent being close to 0.8 @xcite . in a recent study , @xcite car(1 ) process was proposed as a plausible model for explaining correlations in atmospheric daily temperature fluctuations collected from fourteen meteorological centers in hungary .",
    "the choice of the car ( 1 ) model was inspired by the fact that temperature records exhibit both short - term and long - term correlations @xcite .",
    "we generated the data using the car ( 1 ) model proposed by in @xcite @xmath44 the model parameters were chosen as @xmath45 , @xmath46 is zero - mean , unit variance long - range correlated gaussian innovations with scaling exponent @xmath43 , @xmath47 as in @xcite .",
    "log - log plot of the fluctuation function of eqn .",
    "2 , fig . 3 , displayed strong correlations with exponent ( @xmath48 ) at short scales @xmath49 .",
    "however , in the asymptotic regime it displayed an exponent @xmath50 close to that of the long - range correlated gaussian innovations .",
    "fluctuation function of the corresponding volatility series was parallel to @xmath51 , characteristic of monofractal processes .",
    "this has to be contrasted with recent studies @xcite , which provided compelling evidence of long - range correlations @xmath52 in the volatility series of daily temperature fluctuations .",
    "such long - range volatile correlations were observed across randomly chosen and spatially separated meteorological sites across the world . this in turn was attributed to universality in daily temperature records @xcite .    it has been shown that long range correlated data with exponents @xmath53 will exhibit uncorrelated behavior in volatility analysis while the multifractal signals exhibit long range correlations in volatility analysis @xcite . as the car ( 1 ) model , eqn .",
    "2 , is driven by a linear process ( see above ) , one would expect the model to display uncorrelated behavior in the volatility analysis and is indeed the case obtained for this model . since , the car ( 1 ) model eqn.2 @xcite captures the linear features of the temperature data ( as the volatility exponent is 0.5 for this model ) , it will be unable to account for the nonlinear features in the data irrespective of the choice of the process parameter , as demonstrated by figs . 2 and 3 .",
    "equation ( 2 ) @xcite does show distinct scaling behavior with a marked crossover , however , it is not appropriate for modeling the dynamics of daily temperature records . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors subsequently proposed a nonlinear counterpart of car(1 ) model , termed nlcar(1 ) in order to capture the probability distribution of the daily temperature records .",
    "the dfa results obtained in @xcite for nlcar(1 ) and car(1 ) were indistinguishable ( for details we refer to @xcite ) .",
    "however , this does not necessarily imply nlcar(1 ) and car(1 ) have similar volatile correlations .",
    "recent studies @xcite have used nonlinear stochastic models successfully to model glacial dynamics also reflected in long - range volatile correlations . encouraged by previous findings @xcite and results presented in @xcite , we believe that nlcar(1 ) may be a more appropriate model to capture dynamics of daily temperature records .",
