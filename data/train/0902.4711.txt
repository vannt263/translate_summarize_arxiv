    "the galaxy s dsph satellites continue to play a challenging and pivotal role in our understanding of the @xmath7cdm paradigm and the manner in which the milky way formed . not only do there appear to be too few of these systems in comparison with the predictions of cdm satellite dark halos ( klypin et al .",
    "1999 ; moore et al .",
    "1999 ) , but for those who see the dsphs as possible building blocks for the galaxy s halo ( e.g. carollo et al .",
    "2007 ) , their stellar populations pose problems .",
    "not only are their age distributions too young ( unavane et al . 1996 ) , their chemistry , at first blush , is wrong , at least as far as e.g. [ @xmath8/fe ] is concerned ( venn et al .",
    "2004 , and references therein ) .",
    "the report by helmi et al .",
    "( 2006 ) of a dearth of stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath9 3.0 in the more luminous dsphs , if correct , offers no comfort to those who seek the origin of the now well - established galactic extremely metal - poor stars having 4.0 @xmath9[fe / h ] @xmath9 3.0 .",
    "the recent discovery of very low luminosity dsph galaxies , down to m@xmath10 @xmath0  4 ( e.g. belokurov et al .",
    "2006 , 2007 ) , but with associated non - baryonic masses of 10@xmath11  m@xmath12 within the extent of the stellar distribution ( e.g. gilmore et al .",
    "2007 ) hints there is still much to be understood before we have a complete understanding of the process of the formation of our galaxy",
    ".    an important feature of the more luminous of the milky way s dsphs is that there exists a well - established range in metallicity within each system , with dispersions of order 0.30.5 dex ( e.g. helmi et al .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to present evidence that similar behavior pertains to one of the less luminous systems , botes  i , with m@xmath10 = 5.8 ( belokurov et al .",
    "we shall argue that botes  i exhibits a range in metallicity of @xmath0  1.7 dex , @xmath2([fe / h ] ) = 0.45 , and stars as metal - poor as [ fe / h ] = 3.4 .",
    "spectra of @xmath0  330 botes  i candidate members were obtained with the anglo - australian telescope/ aaomega fiber - fed spectrograph ( http://www.aao.gov.au/local/ www / aaomega/ ) combination during 2006 may 2329 and 2007 april 1820 . in the blue , the spectra have resolution r = 5000 , and cover the wavelength range 38504540  , while in the red the corresponding numbers are 14000 and 83408840  , respectively .",
    "candidates were selected from the sdss dr4 data set , using the color magnitude diagram selection mask illustrated in figure 2 of belokurov et al ( 2006 ) .",
    "stars in the magnitude range 17 @xmath9 g @xmath9 20.5 were selected for observation with aaomega , with a deliberate effort to select candidates up to one degree from the galaxy centre , four half - light radii , given the galaxy s apparently distorted and elliptical image .",
    "only limited observational material was obtained in 2006 .",
    "deeper data , using essentially the same target selection , were obtained in 2007 .",
    "the 2006 run was the first major visitor use of the new aaomega facility .",
    "these data sets were used to optimise and enhance the data reduction system , 2dfdr ( see http://www.aao.gov.au/aao/2df/software.html#2dfdr ) , in collaboration with local expertise , leading to its current excellent performance .",
    "final data calibration and reduction used what is now the public 2dfdr system .",
    "heliocentric radial velocities were determined using the hcross routine of the figaro package ( see http://www.starlink.rl.ac.uk/star/docs/sun86.htx/ node425.html ) .",
    "this performs a cross - correlation between the program stellar spectrum and a template , to obtain the relative radial velocity . an associated confidence level and formal error",
    "are estimated and we accept only those with confidence = 1 ( see heavens 1993 ) .",
    "we excised the strong ca ii h & k lines , although this made an insignificant difference in most cases .",
    "two template spectra were used , of twilight sky and a g - giant star , both obtained during the same observing run as the botes  i candidates .",
    "the velocities from the two templates were in general consistent within the errors and here we report those using twilight sky as template .",
    "we thus obtained velocities for 98 objects , for which our mean formal error is 3.6  km s@xmath13 .",
    "the internal accuracy on one observation , from repeat observations of 4 stars from 2006 and 2007 , is 7  km s@xmath13 with a mean offset of @xmath14  km s@xmath13 .",
    "our external errors may be estimated by comparison with martin et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . for 5 stars in common , observed by us in 2007 ,",
    "the mean offset is 4.6  km s@xmath13 , with @xmath2  =  1.8  km s@xmath13 .      for the purposes of the present work we choose to consider objects for abundance analysis only if their spectra have net counts greater than @xmath0  200 per 0.34  pixel at 4150  and lie within the radial velocity range 90115 km s@xmath13",
    "the first criterion is set to obtain a reliable abundance estimate based on the ca ii k 3933  line , while the second admits objects within @xmath3  1.8@xmath2 of the galaxy s systemic velocity ( we adopt a velocity dispersion of 7  km s@xmath13 ) .",
    "data for the 16 objects within our sample that satisfy these criteria are presented in table  1 , where columns ( 1)(5 ) contain identification , coordinates , radial distance from galactic center , and heliocentric radial velocity , ( 6)(7 ) present sdss colors g@xmath15 and ( g  r)@xmath15 ( we adopt e(b  v ) = 0.02 , following belokurov et al .",

    "lower ( 6590 km s@xmath13 ) and higher ( 115140 km s@xmath13 ) values , and for our count restriction , we find a total of 4 objects ( one clearly too strong - lined to be a member ) .",
    "standard galactic components of thin disk , thick disk and halo have predicted mean velocities in this line - of - sight , for a typical distance of dwarf stars of 3 kpc , of 5 , 25 , and 130 km  s@xmath13 , respectively , well - separated from botes  i.      for the putative botes  i members in table  1 we have measured the ca ii k line - strength index , k@xmath16 , and the g band index , g@xmath16 , defined by beers et al .",

    "the reader should be aware that the implicit assumption , that the same [ ca / fe ] vs [ fe / h ] relationship applies within both the metal - poor galactic objects used for the calibration and the dsph satellites , is not consistent with high - resolution abundance studies ( e.g. venn et al .",

    "we found no model - atmosphere calibrations of the triplet in the literature for giants with [ fe / h ] @xmath9 2.5 .",

    "m@xmath12 ( fellhauer et al . 2008 ) , however , the chemical inhomegeneity of botes  i stands in stark contrast against the heavy - element homogeneity of galactic globular clusters of similar stellar mass .",
    "the obvious solution is that botes  i sits within the deep potential well of a dark halo mass  of order 10@xmath37 m@xmath12 .",
    "given that chemical inhomogeneity within globular clusters ( which contain no dark mass ) appears to occur only in massive objects such as @xmath4 cen , it seems reasonable to assume that a requirement for the creation of heavy - element chemical inhomogeneity is that botes  i should have a potential well deep enough to retain the ejecta of type ii supernovae for periods sufficiently long for them to be incorporated into subsequent stellar generations .",
    "there is a test of this : self - enrichment in the lowest luminosity systems will be greatly affected by sampling noise . as demonstrated by the dynamical modelling of fellhauer et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , if botes  i ever had a dark matter halo , it still has it and has lost very little of its stellar mass .",
    "that is to say , botes  i has always had relatively little stellar material .",
    "if one normalizes abundance dispersion with respect to luminosity or current baryonic mass , the specific abundance dispersion of botes  i is some 10100 times larger than that of the more luminous dsph .",
    "not many supernovae are needed to chemically enrich , say , 10@xmath38 m@xmath12 of pristine material to an abundance of [ fe / h ] = 2.5 .",
    "one should expect very specific and different element patterns in the stars of botes  i directly from this very small number of progenitors .",
