    "whereas string - theory in flat minkowski space , as viewed by physicists , is thought to be completely understood on the classical non - interacting level , some of its aspects are still open problems from the mathematical point of view .",
    "the subject of this paper is the analysis of closed strings , which correspond to time - like minimal surfaces , in the @xmath0-dimensional flat minkowski space .",
    "we recall ( see for instance ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 6 ) ) that the minkowski area @xmath1 of a time - like map @xmath2 \\times [ 0,{l } ] \\to { \\ensuremath{\\mathbb r}}^{1+n}$ ] of class @xmath3 is given by @xmath4\\times [ 0,{l } ] }   \\sqrt { \\langle { x}_{t } , { x}_{x}\\rangle_m^2   - \\langle{x}_{t},{x}_{t}\\rangle_m \\langle   { x}_{x},{x}_{x}\\rangle_m }   ~d{t}d{x},\\ ] ] where @xmath5 denotes the minkowskian scalar product in @xmath6 associated with the metric tensor @xmath7 . in the sequel",
    "we always assume @xmath8 to be of the form @xmath9 \\times [ 0,{l}],\\ ] ] and that @xmath10 is closed .",
    "it is well known ( see for instance @xcite ) that in a particular parametrization ( and assuming that all quantities are sufficiently smooth ) critical points of @xmath11 can be described by    @xmath12    see also section [ sec : not ] for the details .",
    "critical points of @xmath11 have been considered by born and infeld @xcite ( in the case of graphs ) , and analyzed later on by many authors .",
    "a large number of explicit solutions to , possibly with singularities in the image of the parametrization ( such as cusps , for instance , where the above regularity condition fails ) is known , see for instance ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 4 ) , @xcite,@xcite .    the nonlinear constraint in is not closed under uniform convergence . indeed ,",
    "many examples in the physical literature @xcite show that the limit of a convergent sequence of relativistic strings is not , in general , a relativistic string , thus leading to the concept of wiggly string .",
    "a natural question is then to characterize the closure of relativistic strings .",
    "this issue is discussed in the physical literature ( for instance in @xcite ) and , for the case of strings which are entire graphs , an answer was provided by y. brenier @xcite .",
    "we obtain an analogous result for the case of closed strings ( see theorem [ th : main ] ) . roughly speaking",
    ", the nonlinear constraint is convexified ( compare and ) , and limit solutions have in general only lipschitz regularity .",
    "then , motivated by an example described by neu in @xcite and by theorem [ th : main ] , in section [ sec : examples ] we discuss various examples . in particular , and as already observed in @xcite when @xmath13 ( see also @xcite ) , we show how additional small oscillations superimposed on the initial datum can prevent the limit solution to collapse to a point ( see examples [ neuoscillating ] and [ exa : giandomenico ] ) .    mathematical questions related to also include the qualitative properties of solutions for special initial data , and their asymptotic shape near a singularity time , for instance near a collapse .",
    "this latter problem is , in turn , intimately related to the existence of weak global solutions , to be defined also after the onset of a singularity . in this paper",
    "we begin a preliminary discussion on this subject .",
    "more precisely , in section [ sec : convex ] we address the study of the convexity preserving properties of the solutions of , when @xmath13 , and their asymptotic profile near a collapsing time . in proposition [ proconvex ] we show that a relativistic string which is smooth and convex and has zero initial velocity , remains convex for subsequent times , and shrinks to a point while its shape approaches a round circle .",
    "this result is analogous to the one proven by gage and hamilton in @xcite for curvature flow of plane curves , and the one proven in @xcite for the hyperbolic curvature flow ( non relativistic case ) .",
    "however , differently from the parabolic case ( see @xcite ) , here the collapsing singularity is nongeneric , the generic singularity being the formation of a cusp , as discussed in @xcite . adopting as a definition of weak solution the one given by dalembert formula for the linear wave system in",
    ", it follows that after the collapse the solution restarts , and the motion is continued in a periodic way .",
    "this is in accordance with the conservative character of the wave system in .",
    "dalembert formula can still provide a possible definition of weak solutions for lipschitz immersions .",
    "in example [ ex : square ] we study the solution corresponding to a homotetically shrinking square . in this case",
    "it turns out that the conservation law below is valid only in special interval of times .",
    "the same example shows that , in contrast with the case of smooth strings , for lipschitz strings the collapsing profile is not necessarily circular .",
    "for @xmath14 we denote by @xmath6 the @xmath0-dimensional minkowski space , which is endowed with the metric tensor @xmath7 .",
    "we indicate by @xmath15 and @xmath16 the euclidean scalar product and norm in @xmath17 , respectively .",
