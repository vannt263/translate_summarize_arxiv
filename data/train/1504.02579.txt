    "there has been a lot of interest in understanding the spin-3/2 ( or the rarita - schwinger @xcite ) fields after the introduction of the supergravity theory @xcite .",
    "this spin-3/2 field , or the gravitino , is the superpartner of the graviton .",
    "however , the consideration of this field in curved spacetimes , particularly in black hole cases , is relatively sparse . in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite the gravitino field was analyzed in the kerr and kerr - newman backgrounds .",
    "the authors there used the newman - penrose formalism @xcite , following the earlier work of chandrasekhar on the dirac field @xcite .",
    "the newman - penrose formalism is very useful in dealing with perturbations of the black hole in four dimensions , but the extension of the formalism to higher dimensions is not straightforward @xcite . for this reason we try , in this paper , to implement a novel and more direct approach to considering the gravitino fields in spherically symmetric spacetimes . in this approach",
    "we shall use the eigenspinors and the eigenspinor - vectors on spheres to separate out the angular parts of the gravitino fields .",
    "we can then obtain the radial equations for the various field components .",
    "these field components are gauge dependent in general .",
    "the gauge symmetry here is that of supersymmetry . in the newman - penrose formalism",
    "the radial equations for some scalar potentials are considered , where these potentials are gauge invariant . in order to compare with this formalism",
    "we also need to construct gauge invariant combinations out of our field components .",
    "the radial equations of these gauge invariant variables can then be used in the analysis of the evolution of spin-3/2 perturbations in spherically symmetry spacetimes , like the schwarzschild background we concentrate on in this paper .",
    "we hope to extend this formalism to higher dimensions in our subsequent works .",
    "the study of the evolution of small perturbations in black hole backgrounds is an old and well established subject @xcite . actually , we know that this evolution , at intermediate times is dominated by damped single frequency oscillations .",
    "these characteristic oscillations have been termed quasinormal frequencies , and depend only on the parameters characterising the black hole . in this sense",
    "we can say that black holes have a characteristic sound @xcite .",
    "note that since the discovery of quasinormal oscillations of black holes , many studies have been done on quasinormal modes ( qnms ) of various spin fields and a considerable variety of analytical , semi - analytical and numerical methods have been developed to determine them @xcite .",
    "however , an interesting problem is to consider the study of the qnms of spin-3/2 fields , where the motivation for studying spin-3/2 qnms from black holes in this paper is two - fold ; the first of these being from the theoretical point of view , where the scarcity of work done in four dimensions @xcite ( and in a future work , greater than four dimensions @xcite ) is an omission in the literature .",
    "our calculations serve to fill this gap .    secondly ,",
    "having a complete catalog of all qnms would be a necessary precursor to eventually studying the emission rates of collider produced , or tev scale black holes @xcite . especially given that in super gravity theories the gravitational field is coupled to the massless spin-3/2 rarita - schwinger field , that acts as a source of torsion and curvature @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in many supergravity models , the supersymmetric breaking scale is related to the gravitino . as such",
    ", the gravitino could be the lightest supersymmetric particle , or even the next to lightest supersymmetric particle ( which could live long enough to be directly detectable in collider environments ) .",
    "as such , spin-3/2 fields could have significant effects on phenomenology .",
    "other than the quasinormal modes one is also interested in the greybody factors and the emission cross - sections of hawking radiation of various spins when black hole evolution in collider environments are studied .",
    "the related absorption probabilities of the gravitino scatterings can be readily considered using the radial equation mentioned above .",
    "the approach we shall take is to use the wkb method , as it allows a more systematic study of qnms , as well as the absorption probabilities , than outright numerical methods .",
    "we will use this , and previous results with wkb and similar methods @xcite , to compare with the newer method developed by some of us , which can be more efficient in some cases , called the asymptotic iteration method ( aim ) @xcite . in the case of absorption probabilities",
    "we shall also study the low energy case using the unruh method .",
    "as such , this paper shall be structured as follows . in the next section",
    "we shall use the eigenspinors and the eigenspinor - vectors on the 2-sphere to separate out the angular parts of the gravitino , or the rarita - schwinger , equations . in section iii ,",
    "we construct the gauge - invariant variable of the gravitino field .",
    "the corresponding radial equations are compared with those obtained using the newman - penrose formalism . in sections",
    "iv and v , the quasinormal mode frequencies and the absorption probabilities of the gravitino field are studied using the radial equation of the gauge invariant variable , respectively .",
    "conclusions and discussions are presented in the last section .",
    "some properties of the eigen - spinors and the eigen - spinor vectors relevant to our discussions are given in the appendix .",
    "we start with the massless rarita - schwinger equation @xmath0 where we have used the notation @xmath1 } = \\gamma^{\\mu}\\gamma^{\\nu}\\gamma^{\\alpha}-\\gamma^{\\mu}g^{\\nu\\alpha}+\\gamma^{\\nu}g^{\\mu\\alpha}-\\gamma^{\\alpha}g^{\\mu\\nu}\\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we consider the rarita - schwinger field in a schwarzschild black hole background with the metric @xmath2 where @xmath3 . note that from now on an overbar represents quantities on the 2-sphere .",
