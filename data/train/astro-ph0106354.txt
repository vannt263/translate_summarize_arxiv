    "knowledge of the shape of the lf ( in different bands ) is a powerful tool for studies of galaxy evolution .",
    "specifically , one can look for correlations between the shape of the general lf and environmental or cluster properties .",
    "in general the lf drops steeply at bright magnitudes and rises gradually at fainter magnitudes as described by a schechter function @xcite .",
    "sometimes , however , features such as bumps and a steeply rising faint part are found , which can not be adequately fitted by a single schechter function .",
    "galaxies in the cluster core region are expected to have a different merger history than the galaxies populating the cluster outskirts where it blends into the field .",
    "this should be reflected in differently shaped lfs for dense and less dense regions within a cluster .",

    "andreon verified the invariance of the shape of the bright part of the type - dependent lf in a large range of environments from the field to the cores of clusters several orders of magnitude denser .",
    "the determination of the exact shapes of lfs is difficult as the faint ends suffer from uncertainties in the contamination by field galaxies .",

    "our data offers the interesting possibility to study the lf for a large range of environments within the cluster .",
    "the primary goals of our survey are to study the lf , the colour - magnitude relation and to complement a large hi survey conducted with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) .    in this paper",
    "we present our data and use our catalogue to construct _ u _ , _ b _ and _ r _ band lfs for various regions of the coma cluster area .",
    "our study complements previous studies of the lf of the coma cluster by providing accurate , deep ccd photometry in three bands , covering an area of 5.2 deg@xmath0 .",
    "our wide field @xmath3 band data is of particular importance , because the @xmath12 colour is a sensitive indicator of the presence of young stellar populations .",
    "furthermore , the rest frame @xmath3 band remains in the optical window out to @xmath13 , which makes the @xmath3 band observations very useful for comparison to high redshift clusters .",

    "this ensured that we would be able to determine the relative zeropoint offsets between exposures and chips and there would be very few gaps in the final mosaic .",
    "furthermore , galaxies in the overlapping regions give us good estimates of the errors due to photon noise and flatfielding .",
    "integration times were @xmath24 s in @xmath1 , @xmath25 s in @xmath2 and @xmath26 s in @xmath3 . the layout of the field is shown in fig .",

    "the overall weather was good with an average seeing during the first two nights of @xmath27 and @xmath28 during the last two nights in the _ r _ band .",
    "the strategy was to observe the central parts of the cluster in _ u _ , _ b _ and _ r _ under photometric conditions . during the first night the standard landolt fields sa107 - 602 and sa101 - 427 were also observed at similar airmasses as the central fields .",
    "these standard fields contain many standard stars and give a good spread over the four ccd chips .",
    "this is important for the absolute calibration , since no two chips have exactly the same characteristics .",
    "in fact it is known that the wfc is non - linear .",
    "the coma fields were observed when the cluster had risen to an airmass @xmath29 . at the start of nights 3 and 4 we took exposures of an empty field ( see section 4.4 ) .",
    "this field was later used to correct _ u _ band galaxy counts for foreground / background contamination .",
    "prior to any reduction the images were inspected to judge their quality . for each chip",
    "the bias frames per night were checked for repeating structures and count levels .",
    "the bias - structures were also visible in the science images .",
    "we combined all bias frames to create an average master bias frame for each night and each chip .",
    "after several tests we decided that the bias subtraction had to be performed in two steps ; we first subtracted the overscan level by fitting a second order polynomial to the columns and then subtracted the ( overscan subtracted ) master bias frames .",
    "the second step successfully removed the remaining bias structures for chips 1,2 and 4 .",
    "chip 3 suffered from a few bad columns .",
    "these were removed by interpolation or by aligning and combining the images taken with a small offset .",
    "the rms noise level in the master bias frame was negligible compared to the rms noise in the science frames .",
    "accurate flat field images were created from the science frames .",
    "we have obtained 52 science images of the coma area per chip per band for the _ b _ and _ r _ bands .",
    "for the _ u _ band we have 23 science images , including the empty fields .",
    "we constructed a _",
    "b _ and _ r _ band masterflat by scaling these images by the mode , rejecting the lowest 10 and highest 15 pixelvalues , followed by median filtering .",
    "band masterflats were constructed in the same way , but there we rejected the lowest 5 and highest 10 pixelvalues before median filtering .    as a test we compared our flatfields to the ones of the wide field imaging survey which are available from the wfc archive .",
    "differences between the flat fields were at the level of @xmath30 or less , assuring that we have good quality flats .",
    "after flatfielding , approximately 2.5 per cent of the area of chip 3 still suffers from @xmath31 per cent variations in the background , because this chip is partly vignetted . because of the overlap between neighbouring pointings this has very little impact on our final mosaic . on average ,",
    "the images are very flat with less than 0.8 per cent variations in the background .",
    "the ultimate aim was to obtain a homogeneous photometric scale over the whole area covered .",
    "we dedicated the photometric anchor point to be chip 4 of pointing 11 ( fig .  [ coma_layout ] ) at airmass 1.000 .",
    "this field was observed during the first night under photometric conditions at a time close to when the standards were taken .",
    "first , we determined the photometric offsets between the four chips of the wfc , using objects in overlapping regions between the two offset exposures for each pointing .",
    "for the _ u _ band the number of bright objects in overlapping areas was low .",
    "therefore , we could not use objects to determine the offsets , since this would have given unreliable results .",
    "instead , we used the skylevel to determine photometric offsets .",
    "first , we made sky - images by filtering out all objects of the science images in the same way as for the flatfields .",
    "comparison of the mean skylevels of the sky images gave the offsets .",
    "the resulting offsets are listed in table  [ offsets ] .",
    "errors indicate the uncertainty in the mean of all independent measurements .",
    "the @xmath32 spread between independent measurements of pairs of different pointings is much larger , and is caused by varying conditions between observations of neighbouring pointings .",
    "the offsets depend on the passband , because the response curves of the four ccds are not identical .",
    "we applied these offsets to bring all chips to the same scale .",
    "only the first two nights were photometric and we proceeded by determining the photometric offsets between neighbouring pointings .",
    "the mean offset values are based on the 8 ( or more ) brightest objects in the overlapping areas in order to guarantee a reliable determination .",
    "we found differences of a few hundredths of a magnitude between fields taken at significantly different times ( airmasses , conditions ) in _ b _ and _ r _ up to more than a tenth of a magnitude in _",
    "u_. we mapped all the photometric offsets per pointing per band and scaled all pointings in such a way that the errors were spread over the total observed region and did not accumulate towards the edges of the covered area .",
    "the final result is that all _ b _ and _ r _ band images have the same zero - point to @xmath33 mag and the _ u _ band images to @xmath34 mag .",
    "this is shown for the @xmath2 and @xmath3 bands in the right panels of fig .",
    "[ scatterr ] .",
    "the photometric calibration was done using landolt standard stars .",
    "we did not have sufficient standard stars on all the chips to solve for the extinction coefficients so we set the extinction coefficients to constant values .",
    "we used average extinction coefficients at the effective wavelengths of the filter+ccd system , as listed in table  [ extinction ] , to derive the colour terms and zero - points .",
    "the zero - points are listed in table  [ calibration ] .",
    "the colour terms were found to be very small ( @xmath35 ) and are neglected . since coma lies close to the galactic pole the extinction is insignificant for our purposes ( 0.043 , 0.034 and 0.021 mag in the _ u _ , _ b _ and _ r _ bands respectively ) .",

    "we stress that a direct comparison is hampered by the fact that these authors use different areas or composite lfs . to demonstrate more clearly that the lf is mainly shaped by the area we extracted trentham s area and constructed @xmath1 and @xmath2 band lfs . in fig .",
    "[ trentham ] we compare the results of both determinations of the lfs .",
    "up to the completeness limits the lfs are very similar showing that not the methodology employed , but the area chosen has the most crucial effect on the shape of the lf .",

    "the changes in the lf shapes are very likely related to the local environment",

    "the @xmath40 parameter of the schechter function measures effectively the faint end slope of the luminosity distribution and characterizes the intermediate and dwarf galaxy populations .",
    "a flat faint end slope implies a lack of these low luminosity galaxies .",
    "lpez - cruz et al .",
    "observe the trend that steep faint end slopes are detected in poorer clusters and the flatter slopes are , on average , found in richer clusters .",
    "this suggests that environmental properties could dictate the faint galaxy population . in a scenario",
    "in which mergers , interactions , tidal stripping , destruction of dwarfs , infall etc .",
    "play a role we expect to see a lack of faint galaxies towards the regions of higher galaxy density .",
    "this then should be reflected in a flattening of the low luminosity end of the lf .",
    "we do observe this effect ; e.g. the slope of the faint end of the @xmath3 band lf decreases from @xmath63 at @xmath64 mpc to @xmath65 in the centre . in terms of the slope of the schechter function these values correspond to @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the effect is also present in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 band lfs , and measured out to a larger radius of @xmath68 mpc .    when comparing the faint end slopes of the coma lfs with those from the sdss the most striking result is that the @xmath2 and @xmath1 band lfs are very similar .",
    "this is remarkable given the differences in environment and galaxy populations .",
    "however , the @xmath3 band slopes of coma are steeper than in the field so apparently there is a relation between the relative increase in low luminosity systems in coma and the colour of the band .",
    "a possible interpretation is that the ( infalling ? ) dwarf galaxies in the outer parts of coma are undergoing bursts of star formation triggered by interactions with neighbour galaxies and/or the intra - cluster medium . as a result",
    "the galaxies brighten , preferentially in the @xmath3 band , causing a steepening of the faint end slopes of the lfs .",
    "if correct , this is a clear sign that the coma cluster is not a relaxed system , but that , especially in its periphery , the cluster is still forming and inducing strong evolution to the galaxy population .",
    "the flattening of all coma lfs towards the cluster centre hints that there the galaxies have already lost most of their gas and enhanced star formation has long ceased .",
    "the group around ngc 4839 has been subject of debate in the literature , because it is not clear whether it is falling into the cluster for the first time or has already made one pass through ( for scenarios see e.g. colless & dunn 1996 ; white et al .",

    "they conclude that it passed at least once through the core .",
    "the lf of the field around ngc 4839 has a different faint end slope than the central lfs which could be related to the dynamical history of this group .",
    "the observed shape differences could be explained if during the passage a large fraction of the dwarf galaxies has been stripped from the group and redistributed throughout the cluster potential .    to explain the dependence of the shape of the lf on projected distance from the cluster centre we would need much more information .",

    "1983 ) , the type - dependent lfs , hi observations etc .",

    "play a role .",

    "the lfs as a function of distance from the cluster centre have ( very ) different shapes than the central lfs and , therefore , no universal general lf exists .",
    "the faint ends of the lfs become steeper towards the outskirts of the cluster .",
    "a steepening of the faint ends of the lfs towards less dense regions clearly supports the existence of environmental effects .",
    "the difference in faint end slopes of the overall lfs and those of the field is colour dependent ( strongest in @xmath3 ) and can be attributed to enhanced star formation in the dwarf galaxy population in the outer parts of coma where evolution apparently is still very strong .",
    "the lfs of the field around ngc 4839 support the idea that this group has passed through the cluster centre at least once .",
    "we are in the process of creating a catalogue of all spectroscopically confirmed cluster members .",
    "this will enable us to revise the coma lfs and to check the quality of the statistical method to determine lfs .",
    "we have also obtained westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) hi mosaic data covering an total area of @xmath70 in order to study the hi properties as function of environment and assess the importance of merging and stripping . combined with our optical data set this",
    "will greatly enhance the ability to study the structure and dynamics of coma , using a data set that is unrivalled by what is available for any other cluster .",
    "we thank the referee for detailed and constructive comments .",
    "part of the data was made publically available through the isaac newton groups wide field camera survey programme . p.",

    "<S> the @xmath3 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 band lfs of the complete sample can not be represented by single schechter functions . for the central area , @xmath4 kpc </S>",
