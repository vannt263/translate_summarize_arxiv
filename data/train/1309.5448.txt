    "a rapid decrease of metallicity , as currently suggested by high - redshift measurements , would produce outliers with weak co - emission .",
    "we use both the mass - metallicity ( @xmath73 ) relation and the fundamental metallicity relation ( fmr ) relating metallicity to @xmath49 and sfr to statistically assign gas - phase metallicities @xcite .",

    "evidence for metallicity evolution at @xmath76 comes from @xcite and @xcite . for the scenario with a broken fmr , we interpolate linearly with redshift the metallicity drop of 0.6 dex reported in @xcite between z=2.5 and z=3.3 and continue this trend beyond z=3.3 to estimate high - z evolution ( but see @xcite for a non - evolutionary interpretation of the low - metallicity readings at high - redshifts ) . for the case of an evolving @xmath73 relation ,",

    "larger gas fractions are obviously recovered if , as in the previous sections , we allow for rapidly declining metallicities . if we assume strong metallicity - evolution at @xmath76 , the gas fractions of m23 and bd29079 appear to agree with the measured ssfr - evolution , and also with some theoretical predictions , e.g. for the case of a continuously increasing ssfr@xmath68(1+z)@xmath101 , as expected for accretion of pristine gas from the intergalactic medium @xcite .",
    "given the low significance of our co - detections and the large systematic uncertainties , our results can only delimit a range for the evolution of gas fractions at @xmath1024 .",
    "additional , direct metallicity estimates for high redshift galaxies would be highly beneficial for further exploration of the evolution of gas fractions . a larger sample of normal galaxies with co - detections at @xmath5 is also clearly needed to reach firm conclusions .",
    "we presented evidence that the co - emission from two @xmath93 massive lbg galaxies is weaker than expected based on the tight correlation between ir and co luminosities satisfied by similar @xmath71 objects .",
    "a plausible explanation is that * @xmath5 * normal galaxies are weak in co due to rapid metallicity - evolution at high redshift . as a result ,",
    "the evolution of molecular gas fractions beyond @xmath11 is fairly uncertain due to the large uncertainties on metallicity - estimates and the shape of the relation between co - to - h@xmath4 conversion factor and metallicity .",
    "also , the exact normalization and dispersion of the main - sequence is not well constrained at these redshifts , and their attenuation properties might have evolved , thus making it even harder to distinguish normal disk - like galaxies from merger - powered sources . our observations ( similarly to results of @xcite ) in any case start to point to the difficulty of detecting gas cooling emission lines from normal galaxies at @xmath5 .",
    "this might remain challenging even with the unprecedented sensitivity of alma if metallicities indeed decrease rapidly for typical massive galaxies at these high redshifts .",

    "<S> we present deep iram plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) observations , searching for co - emission toward two massive , non - lensed lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath0 and 4.058 . </S>",
    "<S> with one low significance co detection ( 3.5@xmath1 ) and one sensitive upper limit , we find that the co lines are @xmath234 times weaker than expected based on the relation between ir and co luminosities followed by similarly , massive galaxies at @xmath302.5 . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with a scenario in which these galaxies have low metallicity , causing an increased co - to - h@xmath4 conversion factor , i.e. , weaker co - emission for a given molecular ( h@xmath4 ) mass . </S>",
    "<S> the required metallicities at @xmath5 are lower than predicted by the fundamental metallicity relation ( fmr ) at these redshifts , consistent with independent evidence . </S>",
    "<S> unless our galaxies are atypical in this respect , detecting molecular gas in normal galaxies at @xmath5 may thus remain challenging even with alma . </S>"
