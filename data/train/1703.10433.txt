    "the dispersion of a solid phase in turbulent wall - bounded flows occurs in many technological processes such particle - blade interactions in the turbines of aeronautical engines .",
    "inertial particles transported in turbulent wall flows display a characteristic preferential accumulation close to the wall . this phenomenology is denoted turbophoresis  @xcite and has been the subject of research in the last three decades  @xcite .",
    "the turbophoretic drift towards the wall is essentially controlled by one nondimensional parameter , the viscous stokes number , that is the ratio between the particle relaxation time @xmath1 and the viscous time scale of the flow @xmath2 , with @xmath3 and @xmath4 the particle density and diameter , @xmath5 and @xmath6 the fluid density and viscosity , and @xmath7 the friction velocity . in particular , the strongest particle accumulation towards the wall is found when the stokes number is about twenty five , @xmath8 .",
    "particles of vanishing stokes number behave as passive tracers and are therefore uniformly distributed in a turbulent flow , whereas heavy particles become insensitive to the turbulence fluctuations , the ballistic limit at high stokes numbers .",
    "a review of experimental studies and direct numerical simulation ( dns ) of turbophoresis over the last years can be found in @xcite , with most recent simulations presented in @xcite . in most of these previous investigations ,",
    "the dynamics of the inertial particle has been studied in parallel flows such as channels or pipes  @xcite .",
    "a different approach is necessary in spatially evolving flows where it is fundamental to understand the dynamics of the near - wall accumulation when the local stokes number of the dispersed phase changes during the particle evolution , i.e.  in the streamwise direction , leading to non trivial effects as those observed in particle - laden turbulent round jets  @xcite . in this context , we present here statistical data from a large - scale direct numerical simulations ( dns ) of a spatially evolving particle - laden turbulent boundary layer at reynolds number @xmath0 , based on the momentum thickness @xmath9 corresponding to a friction reynolds number @xmath10 based on the friction velocity .",
    "this can be seen as a moderate reynolds numbers in experiments but it is certainly high for a fully resolved numerical simulation  @xcite .",
    "the study of particle dynamics in spatial developing boundary layers assumes a fundamental role to advance our understanding in multiphase flows because it represents the most ideal flow where the stokes number changes along the mean stream direction .",
    "a nominal stokes number @xmath11 can be defined to measure the amount of inertia of a single particle population by using the free - stream velocity @xmath12 and the displacement thickness of the boundary layer at the inflow @xmath13 of the computational domain ( or any reference station such as the seeding location ) . for a spatially evolving flow ,",
    "more meaningful local stokes numbers needs to be defined , both based on local internal units @xmath14 , as usually defined in parallel wall flows , and using external flow units @xmath15 , @xmath16 where it should be remarked that the displacement thickness of the boundary layer @xmath17 and the friction velocity @xmath7 change along the streamwise direction .",
    "indeed , the two stokes numbers decrease moving downstream in the boundary layer and tend to the limit of passive tracers . in figure  [ fig1 ]",
    "the two stokes numbers are plotted versus @xmath18 , the reynolds number based on the momentum thickness @xmath9 , usually adopted to parametrize the streamwise distance in turbulent boundary layers  @xcite . as apparent by the decrease of the stokes numbers ,",

    "another peculiar aspect of the turbulent boundary layer is represented by the co - existence of two different zones , the inner turbulent region and the external free stream .",
    "these two regions are separated by an intermittent interface , the viscous super - layer  @xcite , with a fractal nature where the enstrophy generated at the wall diffuses towards the outer irrotational free stream . in many applications ,",

    "we expect a peak in the concentration for all the population once the local stokes number becomes of order 20 ; however , this would happen at a larger distance from the computational inlet and an even longer computational domain would be required to capture this effect , something computationally too expensive for such kind of simulations .",
    "theoretically , in an infinitely long streamwise domain all the particle populations will reach a concentration peak after the second accumulation phase , with the peak position dependent on particle inertia .",

    "particles captured by the boundary layer and approaching the wall from the irrotational free stream are characterized by a strong wall - normal velocity directed towards the wall that is associated with a streamwise velocity larger than that of the carrier phase . in other words ,",
    "particles are seen to enter the boundary - layer wake region via large - structures similar to the high - speed streaks of near - wall turbulence : higher streamwise velocity with wall - normal velocity towards the wall .",
    "a similar trend is observed at @xmath0 , panel @xmath64 , even though the effect is now weakened because the memory of the initial seeding position tends to be lost as particles move along with the flow .",
    "we report statistics of the dynamics of inertial particles transported in a spatially developing turbulent boundary layer .",
    "the reynolds number based on the momentum thickness @xmath18 increases from 200 to 2500 for the computational domain of the present simulation .",
    "a boundary layer flow presents two main features that differentiate the behavior of inertial particles from the more studied case of a parallel turbulent flow , e.g.  in channels and pipes , and it is therefore a relevant test case worth investigation .",
    "the first is the variation along the streamwise direction of the local dimensionless parameters defining the fluid - particle interactions .",
    "the second is the coexistence of an irrotational free - stream and a rotational near - wall turbulent flow .",
    "the first effect has been considered in @xcite .",
    "two different stokes numbers have been defined , one using inner flow units and the other with outer units .",
    "since these two stokes numbers exhibit different decay rates in the streamwise direction , we found a decoupled particle dynamics between the inner and the outer region of the boundary layer .",
    "preferential near - wall particle accumulation is similar to that observed in turbulent channel flow , while different behaviour characterizes the outer region . here",
    "the concentration and the streamwise velocity profiles were shown to be self - similar and to depend only on the local value of the outer stokes number and the rescaled wall - normal distance .",
    "the scope of this paper is to examine the effect of the simultaneous presence of the external laminar stream and of the turbulent shear layer on the particle transport . in particular , we study how inertial particles released in the outer stream disperse inside the boundary layer and approach the wall . to this aim",
    ", we present statistics conditioned by the position of the initial injection and discuss the emergence of a minimum of the wall - normal particle concentration around the boundary layer thickness , @xmath83 .",
    "the imbalance between two different diffusion mechanisms , both directed towards the wall for particle coming from the free stream , induces the concentration minimum in the wall - normal direction .",
    "on one side , we have a relatively slow particle dispersion in the outer part of the boundary layer , due to the mixing by turbulent fluctuations , bringing the solid phase from the outer region to the buffer layer . on the other side",
    ", we have a fast turbophoretic drift due to the decrease of turbulent fluctuations closer to the wall pushing the particles towards the wall .",
    "the different magnitude of the two fluxes creates a region of lower concentration at the edge of the zones where each of the two mechanisms dominate .",
    "the entrainment of particles in the turbulent regions is occurring in regions of higher streamwise velocity and wall - normal velocity towards the wall .",
    "note that these structures , though similar to the near - wall high - speed streaks , are present across the laminar - turbulent interface at the boundary - layer edge effectively leading to a corrugated appearance of the instantaneous laminar - turbulent interface .",
    "a similar minimum in concentration is not observed in channel flows where a laminar region acting as a reservoir of particles and imposing a reference external concentration , does not exist .",
    "hence , there is no imbalance between the two fluxes mentioned above and the minimum concentration occurs at the channel midplane by symmetry .",
    "the present results show that a non trivial dynamics occurs in intermittent regions , relevant for particle entrainment and mixing in several applications .",
    "idealized shear - less configurations have been considered in @xcite where both large fluctuations of the particle distribution and self - similar concentration are observed .",
    "we expect that the presence of a mean shear in an intermittently turbulent / non - turbulent flow adds new interesting features as shown here for the entrainment of particles seeded in the laminar free stream . using the configuration adopted here , we therefore plan to study the behavior of inertial particles in a transitional flow where turbulent spots appear randomly in space and time @xcite .",
