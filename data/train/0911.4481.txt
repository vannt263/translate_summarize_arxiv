    "recent breakthroughs in numerical general relativity have led to predictions of large recoil velocities of merged binary supermassive black - holes ( bh ) as the binary radiates away linear momentum as gravitational waves during the final stages of merger ( gonzlez et al .",
    "2007 ; campanelli et al . 2007 ; lousto , campanelli , & zlochower 2009 ) .",
    "typical kick velocities are of order @xmath7  km  s@xmath0 ( bogdanovi , reynolds , & coleman 2007 ) .",
    "one possible result of these mergers is to cause the resulting remnant black hole ( bh ) to oscillate through the stellar disk on timescales on the order of gyr ( kornreich & lovelace 2008 , hereafter kl08 ; blecha & loeb 2008 ; fujita 2009 ) .",
    "if the merged bh receives an impulse from the merger , some of that motion will be transmitted to the galaxy by dynamical friction .",
    "it is clearly of interest to know whether the motion of the bh through the disk generates observable changes in morphology and dynamics in the galaxy .",
    "binary black - holes have already been observed as a double nucleus in a quasar ( e.g. , decarli et al .",
    "further , comerford et al . (",
    "2009 ) show that bh binaries resulting from recent mergers are observable in the spectra of as many as @xmath8 of seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "the possible observable effects of free and `` wandering '' bh merger remnants on disk galaxies , however , have not yet been fully analyzed . de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos ( 2008 ) discuss the formation of stars in the wakes of runaway black holes ejected from the host galaxy . here",
    "we consider more slowly moving bhs which remain bound to the host galaxy .",
    "this work first analyzes the case where the ejected bh oscillates with angular frequency @xmath9 through the galaxy center in a direction normal to the disk .",
    "later , we discuss the case where the bh is ejected parallel to the plane of the galaxy . sufficiently large gas accretion by the binary bh system is predicted to drive the orbital and bh spins into alignment normal to the plane of the galaxy ( bogdanovi et al .",
    "2007 ) . however , the amount is uncertain due to the uncertainty in the ratio of the two viscosity coefficients for the @xmath10 and @xmath11 motion in the disk ( e.g. , natarajan & armitage 1999 ) .",
    "this alignment favors bh ejection in the plane of the galaxy ( campanelli et al .",
    "the merging process preceding the ejection is assumed to be sufficiently slow that the host galaxy has returned to an axisymmetric equilibrium state .",
    "the bh oscillations are observed in simulations to persist for many periods ( kl08 ; blecha & loeb 2008 ; fujita 2009 ) . under these conditions",
    "we find that there is a strong resonant forcing of the disk radial motion near radii @xmath1 where @xmath12 , with @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the radial epicyclic frequency .",
    "near @xmath1 there can be a strong enhancement of the density in a ring of the disk and shock formation which may trigger the formation of a ring of stars .",
    "we note that models for the formation of observed `` ring galaxies '' assume the ( single ) passage of one galaxy nearly through the center of another ( theys & spiegel 1976 , 1977 ; lynds & toomre 1976 ) . the gravitational interaction of the two galaxies causes the formation of a pronounced ring(s ) of enhanced density ( in one or both of the galaxies ) where star formation is expected to be enhanced .",
    "for the case of bh ejection in the plane of the galaxy we find that the bh leaves behind it a supersonic wake where star formation may be triggered .",
    "the shape of this wake is calculated and the slow - down time of the bh is estimated .",
    "the differential rotation of the disk stretches the wake into ring - like segments .",

    "section 2.2 derives the dynamical equations of the system as driven by the radial force due to a bh oscillating perpendicular to the disk .",
    "the frequencies and amplitudes of the bh oscillations are taken from the @xmath15body simulations of kl08 , section 2.3 discusses the forced oscillations of the gas disk , and  2.4 the possible parametric instability of the disk .",
