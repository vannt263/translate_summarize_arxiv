    "the quality of data can not be assessed without contextual knowledge about the production or the use of data .",
    "actually , the notion of data quality is based on the degree in which the data fits or fulfills a form of usage @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the quality of data depends on their use context .",
    "it becomes clear that context - based data quality assessment requires a formal model of context , at least for the use of data .    in this work",
    "we follow and extend the approach proposed in @xcite . according to it , the assessment of a database @xmath1",
    "is performed by mapping it into a context @xmath2 that is represented as another database , or as a database schema with partial information , or , more generally , as a virtual data integration system with possibly some materialized data and access to external sources of data .",
    "the quality of data in @xmath1 is determined through additional processing of data within the context .",
    "this process leads to a new ( or possible several ) quality version(s ) of @xmath1 , whose quality is measured in terms of how much it departs from its quality version(s ) .    in @xcite ,",
    "dimensions are not considered as contextual elements for data quality analysis . however , in practice dimensions are naturally associated to contexts .",
    "for example , in @xcite , they become the basis for building contexts , and in @xcite they are used for data access data at query answering time .    in order to capture general dimensional aspects of data for inclusion in contexts , we take advantage of the hurtado - mendelzon ( hm ) multidimensional data model @xcite , whose inception was mainly motivated by data warehouse and olap applications . we extend and formalize it in ontological terms .",
    "actually , in @xcite an extension of the hm model was proposed , with applications to data quality assessment in mind . that work was limited to a representation of this extension in description logic ( actually , an extension of dl - lite @xcite ) , but data quality assessment",
    "was not developed .    in this work",
    "we propose an ontological representation in datalog@xmath0 @xcite of the extended hm model , and also mechanisms for data quality assessment based on query answering from the ontology via dimensional navigation .",
    "our extension of the hm model includes _ categorical relations _ associated to categories at different levels in the dimensional hierarchies , possibly to more than one dimension .",
    "the extension also considers _ dimensional constraints _ and _ dimensional rules _ , which could be treated both as _ dimensional integrity constraints _ on categorical relations that involve values from dimension categories .",
    "however , dimensional constraints are intended to be used as _ denial constraints _ that forbid certain combinations of values , whereas the dimensional rules are intended to be used for data completion , to generate data through their enforcement .",
    "dimensional constraints can be _ intra - dimensional _ , i.e. putting restrictions on data values of categorical relations associated to categories in a single dimension , or _ inter - dimensional _ ,",
    "i.e. putting restrictions on data values of categorical relations associated to categories in different dimensions .",
    "the next example illustrates the intuition behind categorical relations , dimensional constraints and rules , and how the latter can be used for data quality assessment . in it we assume , according to the hm model , that a dimension consists of a number of categories related to each other by a partial order .",
    "later on , we use the example to show how contextual data can be captured as a datalog@xmath0 ontology .    [",
    "exp : intr ] consider a relational table _ measurements _ with body temperatures of patients in an institution ( table  [ tab : measurements ] ) .",
    "a doctor in this institution needs the answer to the query : _  the body temperatures of _ tom waits _ for _ september 5 _ taken around noon with a thermometer of brand _ b1 _ \" _ ( as he expected ) .",
    "it is possible that a nurse , unaware of this requirement , used a thermometer of brand _",
    "b2 _ , storing the measurements in _ measurements_. in this case , not all the measurements in the table are up to the expected quality .",
    "however , table _ measurements _ alone does not discriminate between expected or intended values ( those taken with brand _ b2 _ ) and the others .",
    "now , for assessing the quality of the data in _ measurements _ according to the doctor s quality requirement , extra contextual    information about the thermometers used may be useful .",
    "for instance , there is a table _ patientward _ , linked to the _ ward _ category , that stores patients of each ward of the institution ( fig . [",
    "fig : dim ] ) .",
    "in addition , the institution has a _ guideline _ prescribing that : _  temperature measurement for patients in standard care unit have to be taken with thermometers of brand b1\"_.    this guideline , which will become a dimensional rule in the ontology , can be used for data quality assessment when combined with an intermediate virtual relation , _ patientunit _ , linked to the _ unit _ category , that is generated from _ patientward _ by upward - navigation through dimension _ hospital _ ( on left - hand - side of fig .",
    "[ fig : dim ] ) , from category _ ward _ to category _",
    "unit_.    now it is possible to conclude that on certain days , tom waits was in the standard care unit , where his temperature was taken , and with the right thermometer according to the guideline ( patients in wards @xmath3 or @xmath4 had their temperatures taken with a thermometer of brand _ b1 _ ) .",

    "for instance , one capturing that the intensive care unit was closed since august/2005 : _  no patient was in intensive care unit during the time after august /2005\"_. again , through upward - navigation to the next category , we should conclude that the third tuple in table _ patientward _ should be discarded .",
