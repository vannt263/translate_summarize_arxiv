    "one simple way to lift the 4d schwarzschild black hole to a 5d black string is to add an extra flat dimension . in other words",
    "it is possible to uniformly extend the 4d black hole with @xmath0 horizon into the fifth dimension producing a hypercylindrical black hole @xmath1 @xcite . a striking fact related to black strings is their generic instability and final fate and whether these end up as black holes or different objects is still not well understood @xcite , @xcite . in this sense",
    "it is interesting testing more general black string solutions both static and non - static .",
    "some generalizations are obtained by applying a boost to the string solution , dotating the string with the momentum along the fifth coordinate @xcite . in this work",
    "we derive and report a generalized black string solution with mass , arbitrary tension and an additional parameter related to deformation from spherical symmetry .    to generate a generalized black string solution we take as seed the zipoy - vorhees ( zv ) family of solutions and then lift it to 5d by the procedure introduced in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "particular cases are the static black string with arbitrary tension of c. h. lee @xcite and the gregory - laflamme black string @xcite . trapped surfaces and horizons , as well as the mass and string tension parameters , are analyzed and discussed .",

    "assuming that @xmath78 and @xmath79 , then there exists a singularity at @xmath80 since the exponent of @xmath81 in the denominator of ( [ a12 ] ) is always positive , @xmath82 .",
    "also there are two marginally trapped surfaces at @xmath83 , nevertheless these are wrapped or hidden by the naked singularity located at @xmath84 . depending on the values of @xmath27 and @xmath12 , in the product of @xmath85 and @xmath86 may be cancelations that define horizons that coincide with the naked singularity @xmath84 .",
    "another kind of marginally trapped surfaces that overlap the singularity in some regions , arise from the real root @xmath87 of the third degree polynomial @xmath85 .",
    "these surfaces when @xmath88 do not cover completely the singularity due to the dependence on @xmath89 .",
    "then the situation when @xmath88 is that for some ranges of @xmath89 the singularity is hidden but coming from other direction the singularity is naked , i.e. the singularity is partially naked ( or partially dressed ) .    for the black string with arbitrary tension ( @xmath90 ) ,",
    "@xmath65 amounts to    @xmath91    the solution is singular at @xmath84 unless @xmath13 ( @xmath92 ) , case in which it possesses a horizon at @xmath84 ( @xmath93 ) . in any other case ( @xmath94 ) there is a naked singularity at @xmath84 that hides horizons at @xmath95 .",
    "the @xmath65 diverges at @xmath80 showing the singularity there .    in the case @xmath34 and @xmath13 that we recover the black string solution @xcite , it possesses a horizon at @xmath84 as the expression for @xmath65 shows ,    @xmath96    in this case the naked singularity disappears and instead a horizon is located at @xmath84 .    with respect to the analysis of the singularities we have attempted to draw penrose diagram to dilucidate the global structure of the solutions .",
    "however , due to the reduced symmetry of the line element ( [ a8 ] ) the metric function @xmath30 does not depend only on @xmath81 but also on @xmath89 .",
    "even if one drops the @xmath89 dependence , by fixing the angle , the integration to be performed involve hypergeometric functions , and the analysis by this method does not produce a clear picture . on the other hand , the information one obtains by studying the scalar @xmath65 , is essentially the same that can be obtained from the kretschmann scalar .      to characterize the 5d black string we need to determine the mass and tension of the source using the asymptotic expansion of the metric functions @xmath97 and @xmath98 of ( [ a8 ] ) ,    @xmath99    comparing with the asymptotic form of metric around a stationary matter source as given in @xcite , @xcite :    @xmath100",
    "the mass and string tension of the 5d black string ( [ a8 ] ) are identified then as ( we are considering @xmath101 )    @xmath102    therefore when ( [ a1 ] ) is lifted to 5d , by means of the scalar field @xmath103 , the string tension changes in @xmath104 , that can modify the tension and even make it vanish by calibrating @xmath105 , however , from the rod - structure we learned that @xmath106 in order to have a horizon .    in the case @xmath34 and @xmath13 we recover the black string solution @xcite , with @xmath107 . the case @xmath108 and @xmath37 corresponds to a black string with @xmath109 .",
    "in this paper by equiping first the 4d zipoy - vorhees solution with a scalar field , we lifted it to five dimensions ; the so generated 5d solution is a black string characterized by three free parameters : mass , tension and deformation parameter .",
    "there is a physical spacetime singularity at @xmath80 .",
    "moreover , the horizons do not cover completely the naked singularity at @xmath84 , except in the case that @xmath84 is the horizon itself .",
    "therefore , in 5d the cosmic censorship conjecture does not hold .",
    "the static black string with arbitrary tension is a particular case when there is transversal spherical symmetry .",
    "the stability of the 5d generalized black string deserves further analysis , particularly to acquaint how the deformation parameter @xmath27 can affect the stability of the solution , since it modifies the string tension .",
    "we have seen that the three parameter generalizations of the black string solutions are singular .",
    "this may well be an indicator that the black strings are unstable in the sense of @xcite , @xcite .",
