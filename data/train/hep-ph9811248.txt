    "the phenomenology of gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking ( gmsb ) models have been the subject of much interest lately .",
    "they provide an alternative to the usually considered case of the soft terms involving the low energy fields induced by gravity . in gmsb models",
    "the supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking is communicated to the visible sector by gauge fields .",
    "the scale at which this occurs is usually taken to be around @xmath2gev .    the sparticle spectrum in gmsb models has some significant differences from the usual gravity mediated susy breaking models . in gmsb models ,",
    "the gravitino is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) .",
    "the next to lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) is typically the lightest neutralino or the lighter stau .",
    "most phenomenological studies and experimental searches that have been performed in the context of gmsb have taken the lightest neutralino to be the nlsp .",
    "the lightest neutralino then decays by @xmath3 .",
    "if this decay takes place within the detector , the signal involves high @xmath0 photons accompanied by large + 0.55em  @xcite . for much of the parameter space ,",
    "however , the lighter of the two scalar staus is the nlsp . in this case",
    ", the decays of susy particles produce the @xmath4 which subsequently decays to a @xmath1 and the gravitino .",
    "if the @xmath5 decays occur within the detector , signatures for susy production will then generally include @xmath1 leptons from the @xmath5 decays and + 0.55em  due to the stable gravitinos and neutrinos leaving the detector .",
    "it was proposed that gmsb models where the @xmath6 is the nlsp can lead to unusual and distinguishing signatures for susy production at colliders @xcite . at the tevatron , these signals arise from chargino pair production ( @xmath7 ) and from the production of the chargino with the next to lightest neutralino ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "slepton pair production ( @xmath9 where @xmath10 = @xmath11 , @xmath12 , or @xmath1 ) can also be significant .",
    "the subsequent decays typically involve high @xmath0 @xmath1 leptons and substantial + 0.55em . in this paper",
    "we analyze the signals for such susy production at the tevatron .",
    "in particular we consider the parameters for the @xmath13 stau nlsp model line of the gauge mediation / low scale susy breaking working group of the physics at run ii supersymmetry / higgs workshop .",
    "since the observed signal depends on the masses of the sparticles , we first begin by describing the model and the corresponding mass spectrum . in our model ,",
    "the messenger sector consists of some number of multiplets that are @xmath14 representations of su(5 ) .",
    "they couple to a chiral superfield @xmath15 in the hidden sector whose scalar component has a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath16 and whose auxiliary component has a vev @xmath17 . by imposing the requirement that the electroweak ( ew ) symmetry is broken radiatively , the particle spectrum and the mixing angles depend on five parameters : @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and the sign of @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath18 is the messenger scale .",
    "@xmath19 is equal to @xmath17/@xmath16 and is related to the susy breaking scale .",
    "the parameter @xmath20 is dictated by the choice of the vector - like messenger sector and can take the values 1 , 2 , 3 , or 4 to satisfy the perturbative unification constraint .",
    "the definition of @xmath21 is taken as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the vev for the up - type ( @xmath24 ) higgs doublet and @xmath25 is the vev for the down - type ( @xmath26 ) higgs doublet .",
    "the parameter @xmath12 is the coefficient in the bilinear term , @xmath27 , in the superpotential .",
    "constraints coming from @xmath28 strongly favor negative values for @xmath12 in our convention @xcite and , in the cases considered in this work , @xmath12 is taken to be negative . demanding that the ew symmetry be broken radiatively fixes the magnitude of @xmath12 and the parameter @xmath29 ( from the @xmath30 term in the scalar potential ) in terms of the other parameters of the theory .",
    "the soft susy breaking gaugino and scalar masses at the messenger scale are given by [ gmass ] m_i(m ) = n g ( ) and [ smass ] m^2(m ) = 2 n f ( ) ^3_i = 1 k_i c_i ( ) ^2 ^2 where the @xmath31 are the three sm gauge couplings and @xmath32 1 , 1 and 3/5 for su(3 ) , su(2 ) , and u(1 ) , respectively .",
    "the @xmath33 are zero for gauge singlets and are 4/3 , 3/4 and ( @xmath34/2)@xmath35 for the fundamental representations of su(3 ) , su(2 ) and u(1 ) , respectively ( with @xmath34 given by @xmath36 ) . @xmath37 and @xmath38 are messenger scale threshold functions .",
    "we calculate the sparticle masses at the scale @xmath18 using eqs .",
    "( [ gmass ] ) and ( [ smass ] ) and run these to the electroweak scale using the appropriate renormalization group equations @xcite .",
    "the decay chains and hence the signatures for the events depend on the particles initially produced as well as the hierarchy of the masses .",
    "since susy breaking is communicated to the visible sector by gauge interactions , the mass differences between the superparticles depend on the their gauge interactions .",
    "this creates a hierarchy in mass between electroweak and strongly interacting sparticles .",
    "eq.([gmass ] ) shows that the gluino is more massive than the ew charginos and neutralinos , while eq.([smass ] ) shows that squarks are considerably more massive than sleptons .",
    "given this hierarchy of sparticle masses and the current lower bounds on squark and gluino masses , the production of strongly interacting sparticles is probably not a viable search modes for susy at the tevatron run ii .",
    "a more likely mechanism for producing susy particles is via ew gaugino production . at the tevatron ,",
    "chargino pair ( @xmath7 ) production takes place through s - channel @xmath39 and @xmath40 exchange and @xmath41 production is through s - channel @xmath42 exchange . squark exchange via the t - channel also contributes to both processes , but the contributions are expected to be negligible since the squark masses are large in gmsb models .",
    "the production of @xmath43 is suppressed due to the smallness of the coupling involved . in regions of the parameter space where the production of charginos and neutralinos is kinematically suppressed , the pair production of sleptons ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) can be important .",
    "their production occurs through s - channel @xmath39 and @xmath40 exchange .",
    "given the hierarchy of sparticle masses in gmsb models , there are roughly four possible cases to consider for susy production at the tevatron :    case 1 : : :    @xmath47 case 2 : : :    @xmath48 case 3 : : :    @xmath49 case 4 : : :    @xmath50    the three sneutrino masses are nearly the same . the lighter of the selectrons and smuons are essentially right handed and have the same mass . also",
    ", for all the parameter points we considered , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are nearly degenerate in mass .",
    "the possible final state configurations at the tevatron depend on the sparticle spectrum , but they will have certain aspects in common . since the @xmath6 is the nlsp , the various possible decay modes will ( usually ) produce at least two @xmath1 leptons arising from the decays of the @xmath6 s . in addition , there can also be large + 0.55em  due to the stable gravitinos and neutrinos escaping detection .    a special situation in cases 2 and 4 arises when the lighter selectron and the lighter smuon are nearly degenerate in mass to the lighter stau . when the mass difference between the slectron and the stau is less than twice the mass of the @xmath1 , essentially the only decay mode for the selectron is @xmath53 .",
    "the lighter smuon likewise decays via @xmath54 .",
    "this situation is refered to as the  co - nlsp \" case @xcite .",
    "we now give a detailed analysis of the possible tevatron signatures for susy production in the context of gmsb models where the lighter stau is the nlsp and decays promptly within the detector .",
    "this analysis is performed in the context of the main injector ( mi ) and tev33 upgrades of the tevatron collider .",
    "the center of mass energy is taken to be @xmath55tev and the integrated luminosity is taken to be 2fb@xmath56 for the mi upgrade and 30fb@xmath56 for the tev33 upgrade @xcite .    in performing this analysis , the cuts employed are that final state charged leptons must have @xmath57gev and a pseudorapidity , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the polar angle with respect to the proton beam direction , of magnitude less than 1 .",
    "jets must have @xmath60gev and @xmath61 .",

    "the most energetic @xmath1 jet is required to have @xmath64gev .",
    "in addition , a missing transverse energy cut of + 0.55em  @xmath65gev is imposed .",
    "we consider each mass case in turn . in our analysis , we restrict ourselves to those regions of the parameter space where the @xmath6 decays promptly to a @xmath1 and a gravitino . the parameter space is also restricted to those regions where @xmath66 gev .",
    "results from lep-2 set a lower bound of @xmath67gev @xcite .",
    "in this section we do the analysis for points along the line defined by the parameter values @xmath18/@xmath19 = 3 , @xmath13 and @xmath68 .",

    "note that the lightest neutralino is below the selectron / smuon mass at the lower end of the @xmath19 scale ( @xmath69tev ) .",
    "thus for @xmath69tev the mass spectrum is of type 1 . for @xmath70tev ,",
    "the mass spectrum is of type 4 . in this region of @xmath19 , there are more decay modes for the various particles due to the increasing masses of all the sparticles as well as the shift in the position of the lightest neutralino in the mass hierarchy .    the cross sections for these parameters are given in fig .",
    "[ cross1 ] . from the figure ,",
    "the cross sections for @xmath7 and @xmath71 production dominate for the region where @xmath19 is below 65tev .",
    "as @xmath19 increases , the masses of the gauginos increase significantly and hence the cross section falls off . for @xmath72tev ,",
    "the production rates for @xmath73 and @xmath74 are dominant , but the cross sections tend to be rather low .",
    "the signature depends on the allowed decay modes of the sparticles and their branching ratios .",

    "the main decay mode of lightest smuon is @xmath80 and the main decay mode of the lightest selectron is @xmath81 . for higher values of @xmath19 , however , the lightest neutralino mass increases above that of @xmath79 and @xmath78 .",
    "then the only available two - body decay mode for the lightest smuon is @xmath82 with the corresponding decay mode for the lightest selectron .",
    "given the smallness of the coupling involved , though , the possibility exists that some three - body decays could be important .",
    "indeed , the neutralino mediated decays @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the important decay modes @xcite for these higher values of @xmath19 .    since the lightest neutralino tends to be one of the least massive sparticles , its only decay modes are @xmath85 and the decays to @xmath78 and @xmath79 if @xmath86 is greater in mass than those sparticles .",
    "since the lightest neutralino is less massive than the selectrons and smuons for @xmath19 , the only decay mode is @xmath85 .",
    "as @xmath19 increases above 45tev , @xmath78 and @xmath79 become increasingly important , although @xmath85 remains the dominant decay mode .    since the lightest chargino is mostly wino , it couples mainly to  left - handed \" sfermions .",
    "thus the decay mode @xmath87 is typically important due to the significant mixing of the left - handed and right - handed staus and the lower mass of the @xmath75 .",

    "thus with the subsequent decay @xmath76 , there are typically two @xmath1 leptons produced in @xmath7 production at these values of @xmath19 . as @xmath19 increases , however , the decay mode @xmath88 becomes available and becomes the dominant decay mode as @xmath19 increases above 60tev . with the two @xmath1 leptons that can be expected from the lightest neutralino decay and the @xmath89 decay",

    "the dominant decay mode is @xmath90 at 50 - 60% .",

    "the decay @xmath92 , where h is the higgs boson , rapidly becomes the dominant decay mode .",
    "the decay @xmath93 is also present , but of relatively little importance .",
    "given the cuts that we place on the @xmath1-jets , the question arises as to how high we can expect the @xmath94 of the @xmath1-jets to be .",

    "the branching ratios for more than three @xmath1-jets tend to be small after cuts , however , as tables  [ tau1br50 ] and [ tau1br70 ] demonstrate .",
