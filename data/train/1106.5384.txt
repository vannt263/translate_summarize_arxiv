    "the inflationary paradigm @xcite solves successfully the problems of the big bang model and also provides us with a mechanism to generate the primordial perturbations from quantum fluctuations that are later imprinted as anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation and in the large - scale structure of the universe .",
    "in particular , regarding the cmb power spectrum , we now know that it is nearly scale invariant @xcite , mostly of adiabatic origin and it contains almost all the information about the primordial perturbations ( i.e. the perturbations are nearly gaussian ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the predictions of many models of inflation .",
    "however , a small amount of non - gaussianity is still allowed by the cmb data and recently there have been several claims of detection of non - gaussianity of the primordial perturbations @xcite .",
    "if the values of the non - gaussianity parameters are of the order of magnitude claimed then nasa s satellite , planck @xcite , which is already up in the sky taking data , should be able to measure these values at many standard deviations @xcite .",
    "these are exciting times for theoretical cosmologists that for the past ten years or so have been trying to construct models where large non - gaussianity is produced .",
    "it is well known that the simplest and most popular inflationary model , a single scalar field with standard kinetic term satisfying the slow - roll conditions and with standard initial conditions for the vacuum state of the quantum perturbation predicts a level of non - gaussianity that is small and unobservable @xcite , even for the planck satellite @xcite .",
    "therefore , the previously mentioned observations have the potential if confirmed to rule out a large and most popular class of models .",
    "it is good on itself to rule out many models in one go and even better that a detection of non - gaussianity ( the same applies to the tensor - to - scalar ratio ) would allows us to progress significantly in our understanding of the mechanism that drove inflation in the early universe , this is because higher - order statistics contain much more information about the dynamics that the power spectrum .    our searches for inflationary models producing large observable non - gaussianity have been fruitful .",
    "many possibilities have been found , for example models with non - canonical kinetic terms ( like dbi - inflation , k - inflation , ghost - inflation ) @xcite , multiple field models of inflation @xcite , temporary violations of the slow - roll conditions and small departures of the initial vacuum state from the standard bunch - davies vacuum @xcite . for recent reviews about these mechanisms to produce non - gaussian perturbations",
    "see @xcite .",
    "both at the bispectrum level ( three - point correlation function ) and the trispectrum level ( four - point correlation function ) many observationally distinct shapes of these higher - order correlations have been found @xcite .",
    "some of these shapes of non - gaussianity have been constrained with cmb data @xcite and large - scale structure data @xcite .",
    "current limits on the amplitude of the bispectrum , taken from the 7-year wmap @xcite data at 95% confidence level are @xcite : @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 for the local , equilateral and orthogonal shapes respectively . ref .",
    "@xcite has a more recent analysis of the cmb bispectrum ( see @xcite for the trispectrum analysis ) including many other shapes .",
    "planck satellite will improve all these constraints significantly and will also improve existing constraints on the amplitude of the trispectrum .",
    "for some review papers on observational aspects of non - gaussianity see for instance @xcite .    in this paper , in order to produce large and observable non - gaussianity , we shall study a model where the slow - roll conditions are temporarily violated .",
    "this model can be included in the class of models with  features \" ( i.e. non - scale invariant models ) in the potential or more generally in the field s lagrangian @xcite .",
    "there are several other reasons that motivate the study of ",
    "feature(s ) \" models .",
    "for instance , it has been shown that these models can provide better fits to the power spectrum of the cmb anisotropies than the @xmath3 model @xcite . in these models , this is achieved thanks to the introduction of new parameters ( and scales ) that can be tuned to coincide with well known  glitches \" @xmath4 in the cmb spectrum data .",
    "these models are also of theoretical interest because they have very distinct bispectrum signatures like scale - dependence ( e.g.  ringing \" and localization of @xmath5 ) .",
    "the features often have a more fundamental physical explanation , like for example they might be localized sharp features due to particle production during inflation @xcite , due to a duality cascade in brane inflation @xcite , periodic features due to the production of instantons in axion monodromy inflation @xcite or phase transitions @xcite .",
    "the study of these more realistic scenarios might eventually allows us to identify the underlying microscopic theory of inflation .    in particular , in this paper we will study a model where the mass of the inflaton field suddenly changes .",
    "we will describe this using a toy model where the change is approximated by a heaviside step function .",
    "for example , this might be a toy model for a first order phase transition .",
    "we will compute the power spectrum and the bispectrum of the curvature perturbation and show that its amplitude can be large and that its shape is new with very distinctive features .",
    "this paper is divided into the following sections . in section",
    "[ sec : model ] , we introduce the model and give the analytical background solution under some approximations . in section [ sec : pert ] we discuss linear perturbations , present an analytical approximation for the mode function of the primordial curvature perturbation and finally calculate the analytical power spectrum and compare it with the numerical result . in section [ sec : bispectrum ] , we compute the dominant contribution to the bispectrum of the curvature perturbation in two interesting limits , namely the equilateral limit and the squeezed limit . section [ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to the conclusion .",

    "in this paper , we introduced an inflationary model driven by a single standard kinetic term scalar field .",

    "@xmath233 is linearly enhanced towards large @xmath68 as @xmath234 .",

    "it would be interesting to consider observational constraints on this kind of strongly scale dependent and oscillatory bispectrum models but this is outside the scope of the present paper .    secondly , we considered the squeezed limit of the bispectrum . for scales",
    "much smaller than @xmath59 , again we found an oscillatory behavior in @xmath68 with  angular frequency \" @xmath230 .",
    "when the size of the smallest side of the squeezed triangle is @xmath235 then the quantity @xmath183 has as enhancement factor of @xmath236 . this might have important consequences regarding the detectability of the present signal in the data . for larger scales , we found that the quantity @xmath182 is suppressed by the square of the ratio @xmath190 which implies that for values of @xmath12 of order one , its value is too small to be observational relevant .",
    "we have shown that for a wide choice of the model parameter @xmath12 , the squeezed and equilateral limits of the bispectrum can be large for scales much smaller than @xmath59 .",
    "this represents a significant enhancement with respect to the canonical single field slow - roll model result .",
    "in particular , the squeezed limit of the bispectrum can be large in comparison with any single field model of inflation known to the authors .",
    "see however refs .",
    "@xcite for non - vacuum initial state scenarios which also give significant enhancement factors but which have been shown @xcite not to be enough to put the cmb bispectrum within the reach of the planck satellite .",
    "it would be very interesting to repeat that analysis for the present model .",
    "the analytical approximation for the mode function used in this paper breaks down for scales close to the scale set by the transition so the present method can not be applied to compute the bispectrum at these scales . in order to perform that computation one has to numerically integrate the equation of motion for the curvature perturbation and then calculate the bispectrum integral numerically .",
