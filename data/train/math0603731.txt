    "it is well known that the spectrum of the operator @xmath18 consists of the landau levels @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and the multiplicity of each eigenvalue @xmath7 is infinite ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , the spectrum of @xmath12 is absolutely continuous , equals @xmath21 , and has an infinite set of thresholds @xmath19 , @xmath22 .    for @xmath23",
    "we denote by @xmath24 the variables on the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "we assume that the electric potential @xmath25 is lebesgue measurable , and satisfies the estimates @xmath26 with @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 .    on the domain of @xmath12",
    "we introduce the operator @xmath32 .",
    "since @xmath4 is a relatively compact perturbation of @xmath12 , it follows from the weyl criterion that the essential spectra of @xmath5 and @xmath12 are the same .",
    "moreover , since @xmath4 is a relatively trace - class perturbation , the kato - rosenblum theorem implies that the absolutely continuous spectrum coincides with @xmath33 .",
    "it is well known that @xmath5 can have infinite negative discrete spectrum and , for some special @xmath4 , it can have infinitely many embedded eigenvalues below each landau level ( see @xcite , @xcite or @xcite ) . on the other hand , it is shown in @xcite that in the case of sign - definite @xmath4 , the spectral shift function ( ssf ) for the operator pair @xmath9 has a singularity at each landau level . therefore , it is natural to expect that there could be accumulation of the resonances of the operator @xmath5 near the landau levels . for a coulomb potential ,",
    "some numerical results confirm this conjecture @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to study the resonances near the landau levels , and to establish the link between these resonances and the spectral shift function by the so - called breit - wigner approximation .",
    "such a representation of the derivative of the spectral shift function related to the resonances , implies trace formulas which have given recently a substantial impetus to the research concerning the upper and lower bounds of the number of resonances in different situations ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we consider potentials @xmath4 which decay super - exponentially with respect to @xmath11 ( or are compactly supported with respect to @xmath11 ) .",

    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we define the resonances as the poles of the resolvent , the first step being to introduce a riemann surface to which the resolvent is extended .",
    "note that the resonances defined as poles of the resolvent , are also zeros of a generalized krein perturbation determinant with the same multiplicity . in section 3 , we obtain an upper bound of the number of resonances in a domain @xmath39 as @xmath37 tends to @xmath38 ( see theorem [ thmub ] ) . in section 4 , we obtain more information on the localization of the resonances for the case of perturbations of definite sign . in particular , we show that there is an infinite number of resonances near any arbitrary fixed landau level for small @xmath4 of sufficiently rapid decay ( see theorem [ smallv ] ) , and that there are no embedded eigenvalues for small positive @xmath4 ( see proposition [ cor2 ] ) .",
    "at last , in section 5 , we represent the derivative of the spectral shift function near the landau levels as a sum of a harmonic measure related to the resonances and the imaginary part of a holomorphic function ( see theorem [ thmbw ] ) .",
    "such a representation justifies the breit - wigner approximation , implies a trace formula , and for a special class of @xmath4 sufficiently slowly decaying with respect to the variables perpendicular to the magnetic field , allows us to estimate the remainder in the asymptotic relations obtained in @xcite .",
    "in this section we define the resonances of @xmath40 for @xmath4 decaying super - exponentially with respect to @xmath11 , i.e. @xmath41 for @xmath42 and any @xmath43 . as in @xcite ,",
    "the resonances will be defined as the poles of the meromorphic continuation of the resolvent in some weighted @xmath44 spaces .",
    "since @xmath4 is not compactly supported with respect to @xmath11 , the cut - off resolvent can not be used here .",
    "first , we have to prove the existence of a holomorphic extension for the unperturbed operator .",
