    "the predictions of this previous model are in order of magnitude agreement with all existing experimental data , however , only provided we use the small mixing angle msw  @xcite ( sma - msw ) solution .",
    "but , for the reasons given below , the sma - msw solution is now disfavoured by experiments .",
    "so here we review a modified version of the previous model , which manages to accommodate the large mixing angle msw ( lma - msw ) solution for solar neutrino oscillations using 6 additional higgs fields ( relative to the standard model ) vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) as adjustable parameters .    a neutrino oscillation solution to the solar neutrino problem and a favouring of the lma - msw solution",
    "is supported by sno results  @xcite : the measurement of the @xmath1b and @xmath2 solar neutrino fluxes shows no significant energy dependence of the electron neutrino survival probability in the super - kamiokande and sno energy ranges .",
    "moreover , the important result which also supports lma - msw solution on the solar neutrino problem , reported by the super - kamiokande collaboration  @xcite , that the day - night asymmetry data disfavour the sma - msw solution at the @xmath3 c.l ..    in fact , global analyses  @xcite of all solar neutrino data have confirmed that the lma - msw solution gives the best fit to the data and that the sma - msw solution is very strongly disfavoured and only acceptable at the @xmath4 level .",
    "typical best fit values of the mass squared difference and mixing angle parameters in the two flavour lma - msw solution are @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in the next section , we present our gauge group  the family replicated gauge group  and the quantum numbers of fermion and higgs fields .",
    "then , in section @xmath7 we discuss our philosophy of all gauge- and yukawa couplings at planck scale being of order unity . in section @xmath8",
    "we address how the family replicated gauge group breaks down to standard model gauge group , and we add a small review of see - saw mechanism .",

    "we discuss further modification of our model and present a preliminary results of baryon number to entropy ratio in section @xmath13 .",
    "finally , section @xmath14 contains our conclusion .",
    "our model has , as its back - bone , the property that there are generations ( or families ) not only for fermions but also for the gauge bosons , , we have a generation ( family ) replicated gauge group namely @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the standard model gauge group @xmath17 , @xmath18 denotes the cartesian product and @xmath19 runs through the generations , @xmath20 .    note that this family replicated gauge group , eq .",
    "( [ eq : frg ] ) , is the maximal gauge group under the following assumptions :    * it should only contain transformations which change the known 45 (= 3 generations of 15 weyl particles each ) weyl fermions of the standard model and the additional three heavy see - saw ( right - handed ) neutrinos .",
    "that is our gauge group is assumed to be a subgroup of @xmath21 .",
    "* we avoid any new gauge transformation that would transform a weyl state from one irreducible representation of the standard model group into another irreducible representation : there is no gauge coupling unification .",
    "* the gauge group does not contain any anomalies in the gauge symmetry ",
    "neither gauge nor mixed anomalies even without using the green - schwarz anomaly cancelation mechanism .",
    "* it should be as big as possible under the foregoing assumptions .",
    "[ table1 ]    .all @xmath22 quantum charges in the family replicated model .",
    "the symbols for the fermions shall be considered to mean `` proto''-particles .",
    "non - abelian representations are given by a rule from the abelian ones ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : mod ] ) ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the quantum numbers of the particles / fields in our model are found in table 1 and use of the following procedure : in table 1 one finds the charges under the six @xmath22 groups in the gauge group [ eq : frg ] .",
    "then for each particle one should take the representation under the @xmath23 and @xmath24 groups ( @xmath20 ) with lowest dimension matching to @xmath25 according to the requirement @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the triality and duality for the @xmath19th proto - generation gauge groups @xmath24 and @xmath23 respectively .",
    "any realistic model and at least certainly our model tends to get far more fundamental couplings than we have parameters in the standard model and thus pieces of data to fit .",
    "this is especially so for our model based on many @xmath22 charges  @xcite because we take it to have practically any not mass protected particles one may propose at the fundamental mass scale , taken to be the planck mass . especially we assume the existence of dirac fermions with order of fundamental scale masses needed to allow the quark and lepton weyl particles to take up successively gauge charges from the higgs fields vevs .",
    "so unless we make assumptions about the many coupling constants and fundamental masses we have no chance to predict anything .",
    "almost the only chance of making an assumption about all these couplings , which is not very model dependent , is to assume that they are _ all of order unity _ in the fundamental unit .",
    "this is the same type of assumption that is really behind use of dimensional arguments to estimate sizes of quantities .",
    "a procedure very often used successfully .",
    "if we really assumed every coupling and mass of order unity we would get the effective yukawa couplings of the quarks and leptons to the weinberg - salam higgs field to be also of order unity what is phenomenologically not true . to avoid this prediction",
    "we then blame the smallness of all but the top - yukawa coupling on smallness in fundamental higgs vevs .",
    "that is to say we assume that the vevs of the higgs fields in table 1 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are ( possibly ) very small compared to the fundamental / planck unit , and these are the quantities we have to fit .",
    "technically we implement these unknown  but of order unity according to our assumption  couplings and masses by a monte carlo technique : we put them equal to random numbers with a distribution dominated by numbers of order unity and then perform the calculation of the observable quantities such as quark or lepton masses and mixing angles again and again .",
    "at the end we average the logarithmic of these quantities and exponentiate them . in this way",
    "we expect to get the typical order of magnitude predicted for the observable quantities .",
    "in praxis we do not have to put random numbers in for all the many couplings in the fundamental model , but can instead just provide each mass matrix element with a single random number factors .",
    "after all a product of several of order unity factors is just an order unity factor again . to resume our model philosophy",
    ": _ only higgs field vevs are not of order unity",
    ". we must be satisfied with order of magnitude results . _",
    "the family replicated gauge group broken down to its diagonal subgroup at scales about one or half order of magnitude under the planck scale by higgs fields ",
    "@xmath32 , @xmath31 , @xmath30 , @xmath29 and @xmath33 ( in table  [ table1 ] ) : @xmath36 this diagonal subgroup is further broken down by yet two more higgs fields  the weinberg - salam higgs field @xmath35 and another higgs field @xmath34  to @xmath37 .",
    "see - saw mechanics is build into our model to fit the scale of the neutrino oscillations , , we use the right - handed neutrinos with heavy majorana masses ( @xmath38 gev ) .    in",
    "order to mass - protect the right - handed neutrino from getting planck scale masses , we have to introduce @xmath39 which breaks the @xmath40 quantum charge spontaneously , and using this new higgs filed we are able to deal the neutrino oscillations , , to fit the scale of the see - saw particle masses .",
    "however , due to mass - protection by the standard model gauge symmetry , the left - handed majorana mass terms should be negligible in our model . then , naturally , the light neutrino mass matrix  effective left - left transition majorana mass matrix  can be obtained via the see - saw mechanism  @xcite : @xmath41",
    "using the @xmath22 fermion quantum charges and higgs field ( presented in table  [ table1 ] ) we can calculate the degrees of suppressions of the left - right transition ",
    "dirac mass  matrices and also majorana mass matrix ( right - right transition ) .    note that the random complex order of unity numbers which are supposed to multiply all the mass matrix elements are not represented in following matrices : the up - type quarks : @xmath42 the down - type quarks : @xmath43 the charged leptons : @xmath44 the dirac neutrinos : @xmath45 and the majorana ( right - handed ) neutrinos : @xmath46",
    "it should be kept in mind that the effective yukawa couplings for the weinberg - salam higgs field , which are given by the higgs field factors in the above mass matrices multiplied by order unity factors , are the running yukawa couplings at a scale _ near the planck scale_. in this way , we had to use the renormalisation group ( one - loop ) @xmath47-functions to run these couplings down to the experimentally observable scale which we took for the charged fermion masses to be compared to `` measurements '' at the scale of @xmath48 , except for the top quark mass prediction .",
    "we define the top quark pole mass : @xmath49 where we put @xmath50 for simplicity .",
    "we use the one - loop @xmath47 functions for the gauge couplings and the charged fermion yukawa matrices  @xcite as follows : @xmath51 where @xmath52 .",
    "by calculation we use the following initial values of gauge coupling constants : @xmath53      the effective light neutrino masses are given by an irrelevant , nonrenormalisable ( 5 dimensional term )  effective mass matrix @xmath54  for which the running formula is  @xcite : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the weinberg - salam higgs self - coupling constant and the mass of the standard model higgs boson is given by @xmath57 .",
    "we just for simplicity take @xmath58 thereby we ignore the running of the higgs self - coupling and fixed as @xmath59 .",
    "note that the renormalisation group equations are used to evolve the effective neutrino mass matrix from the see - saw sale , set by @xmath60 in our model , to @xmath48 .",
    "in the philosophy of order unity numbers spelled out in section  [ philo ] we evaluate the product of mass - protecting higgs vevs required for each mass matrix element and provide it with a random complex number , @xmath61 , of order one as a factor taken to have gaussian distribution with mean value zero .",
    "but we hope the exact form of distribution does not matter much provided we have @xmath62 . in this way , we simulate a long chain of fundamental yukawa couplings and propagators making the transition corresponding to an effective yukawa coupling in the standard model and the parameters in neutrino sector . in the numerical computation",
    "we then calculate the masses and mixing angles time after time , using different sets of random numbers and , in the end , we take the logarithmic average of the calculated quantities according to the following formula : @xmath63 here @xmath64 is what we take to be the prediction for one of the masses or mixing angles , @xmath65 is the result of the calculation done with one set of random number combinations and @xmath66 is the total number of random number combinations used .",
    "since we only expect to make order of magnitude fits , we should of course not use ordinary @xmath67 defined form the experimental uncertainties by rather the @xmath67 that would correspond to a relative uncertainly  an uncertain factor of order unity . since the normalisation of such",
    "a @xmath67 is not so easy to choose exactly we define instead a quantity which we call the goodness of fit ( ) .",
    "since our model can only make predictions order of magnitudewise , this quantity should only depend on the ratios of the fitted masses and mixing angles to the experimentally determined masses and mixing angles : @xmath68 ^ 2 \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath69 are the corresponding experimental values presented in table  [ convbestfit ] .",
    "we should emphasise that we adjust the order of one numbers by selection , , the complex random numbers are needed for only calculational purposes .",
    "that means that we have only six adjustable parameters  vevs of higgs fields  and , on the other hand , that the averages of the predicted quantities , @xmath64 , are just results of integration over the `` dummy '' variables  random numbers ",
    "therefore , the random numbers are not at all parameters !    strictly speaking ,",
    "however , one could consider the choice of the distribution of the random order unity numbers as parameters .",
    "but we hope that provided we impose on the distribution the conditions that the average be zero and the average of the logarithm of the numerical value be zero , too , any reasonably smooth distribution would give similar results for the @xmath64 values at the end . in our early work  @xcite we did see that a couple of different proposals did not make too much difference .",
    "we averaged over @xmath70 complex order unity random number combinations .",
    "these complex numbers are chosen to be a number picked from a gaussian distribution , with mean value zero and standard deviation one , multiplied by a random phase factor .",
    "we put them as factors into the mass matrices ( eqs .",
    "[ m_u]-[mmajo ] ) .",
    "then we computed averages according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : avarage ] ) and used eq .",
    "( [ gof ] ) as a @xmath67 to fit the @xmath10 free parameters and found : @xmath71 where , except for the weinberg - salam higgs field and @xmath72 , the vevs are expressed in planck units .",
    "hereby we have considered that the weinberg - salam higgs field vev is already fixed by the fermi constant .",
    "the results of the best fit , with the vevs in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vevs ] ) , are shown in table  [ convbestfit ] and the fit has @xmath73 .",
    "we have @xmath74 degrees of freedom ",
    "predictions  leaving each of them with a logarithmic error of @xmath75 , which is very close to the theoretically expected value @xmath76  @xcite .",
    "this means that we can fit all quantities within a factor @xmath77 of the experimental values .",
    "@xmath78    [ convbestfit ]    from the table  [ convbestfit ] the experimental mass values are a factor two higher than predicted for down , charm and for the cabibbo angle @xmath79 while they are smaller by a factor for strange and electron . thinking only on the angles and masses ( not squared )",
    "the agreement is in other cases better than a factor two .",
    "experimental results for the values of neutrino mixing angles are often presented in terms of the function @xmath80 rather than @xmath81 ( which , contrary to @xmath80 , does not have a maximum at @xmath82 and thus still varies in this region ) . transforming from @xmath81 variables to @xmath80 variables , our predictions for the neutrino",
    "mixing angles become : @xmath83 we also give here our predicted hierarchical neutrino mass spectrum : @xmath84    our agreement with experiment is excellent : all of our order of magnitude neutrino predictions lie inside the @xmath85 c.l .",
    "border determined from phenomenological fits to the neutrino data , even including the chooz upper bound .",
    "our prediction of the solar mass squared difference is about a factor of @xmath86 larger than the global data fit even though the prediction is inside of the lma - msw region , giving a contribution to our goodness of fit of @xmath87 .",
    "our chooz angle also turns out to be about a factor of @xmath86 larger than the experimental limit at @xmath88 c.l .",
    ", delivering another contribution of @xmath87 . in summary our predictions for the neutrino sector",
    "agree extremely well with the data , giving a contribution of only 0.34 to while the charged fermion sector contributes 3.29 to .",
    "since we have taken our random couplings to be  whenever allowed  we have order of unity or essentially maximal @xmath89-violation so a unitary triangle with angles of order one is a success of our model .",
    "after our fitting of masses and of mixings we can simply predict order of magnitudewise of @xmath89-violation in @xmath90 decay or in ckm and mns mixing matrices in general .    the jarlskog area",
    "@xmath91 provides a measure of the amount of @xmath89 violation in the quark sector  @xcite and , in the approximation of setting cosines of mixing angles to unity , is just twice the area of the unitarity triangle : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the @xmath89 violation phase in the ckm matrix . in our model",
    "the quark mass matrix elements have random phases , so we expect @xmath93 ( and also the three angles @xmath94 , @xmath47 and @xmath95 of the unitarity triangle ) to be of order unity and , taking an average value of @xmath96 , the area of the unitarity triangle becomes @xmath97 using the best fit values for the ckm elements from table  [ convbestfit ] , we predict @xmath98 to be compared with the experimental value @xmath99 . since",
    "our result for the jarlskog area is the product of four quantities , we do not expect the usual @xmath100 logarithmic uncertainty but rather @xmath101 logarithmic uncertainty .",
    "this means our result deviates from the experimental value by @xmath102 = 1.7 `` standard deviations '' .",
    "the jarlskog area has been calculated from the best fit parameters in table 2 , it is also possible to calculate them directly while making the fit .",
    "so we have calculated @xmath91 for @xmath70 complex order unity random number combinations .",
    "then we took the logarithmic average of these @xmath103 samples of @xmath91 and obtained the following result : @xmath104 in good agreement with the values given above .",
    "another prediction , which can also be made from this model , is the electron `` effective majorana mass ''  the parameter in neutrinoless beta decay  defined by : @xmath105 where @xmath65 are the masses of the neutrinos @xmath106 and @xmath107 are the mns mixing matrix elements for the electron flavour to the mass eigenstates @xmath19 .",
    "we can substitute values for the neutrino masses @xmath65 from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : neutrinomass1]-[eq : neutrinomass3 ] ) and for the fitted neutrino mixing angles from table  [ convbestfit ] into the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mmajeff ] ) .",
    "as already mentioned , the @xmath89 violating phases in the mns mixing matrix are essentially random in our model .",
    "so we combine the three terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mmajeff ] ) by taking the square root of the sum of the modulus squared of each term , which gives our prediction : @xmath108    in the same way as being calculated the jarlskog area we can compute using @xmath70 complex order unity random number combinations to get the @xmath109 . then we took the logarithmic average of these @xmath103 samples of @xmath109 as usual : @xmath110 this result does not agree with the central value of recent result ",
    "`` evidence ''  from the heidelberg - moscow collaboration  @xcite .",
    "having now a well fitted model giving orders of magnitude for all the yukawa couplings and having the see - saw mechanism , it is obvious that we ought to calculate the amount of baryons @xmath111 relative to entropy being produced via the fukugita - yanagida mechanism  @xcite . according to this mechanism the decay of the right - handed neutrinos by @xmath89-violating couplings lead to an excess of the @xmath40 charge ( meaning baryon number minus lepton number ) ,",
    "the relative excess in the decay from majorana neutrino generation number @xmath19 being called @xmath112 .",
    "this excess is then immediately  and continuously back and forth  being converted partially to a baryon number excess , although it starts out as being a lepton number @xmath113 asymmetry , since the right - handed neutrinos decay to leptons and weinberg - salam higgs particles .",
    "it is a complicated discussion to estimate to what extend the @xmath40 asymmetry is washed out later in the cosmological development , but our estimates goes that there is not enough baryon number excess left to fit the big bang development at the stage of formation of the light elements primordially ( nuclearsynthesis ) .",
    "recently we have , however , developed a modified version  @xcite of our model  only deviating in the right - handed sector  characterized by changing the quantum numbers assumed for the see - saw scale producing higgs field @xmath34 in such a way that the biggest matrix elements in the right - handed mass matrix ( eq .  [ mmajo ] ) becomes the pair of  because of the symmetry ",
    "identical off diagonal elements ( row , column)=(2,3 ) and ( 3,2 ) .",
    "thereby we obtain two almost degenerate right - handed neutrinos and that helps for making the @xmath40 asymmetry in the decay bigger . in this modified model that turns out to fit the rest of our predictions approximately equally well or even better",
    "we then get a very satisfactory baryon number relative to entropy prediction @xmath114 in the same time as making this modification of the @xmath34 quantum numbers we also made some improvements in the calculation by taking into account the running of the dirac neutrino yukawa couplings from the planck scale to the corresponding right - handed neutrino scales . also , we calculated more accurate dilution factors than previous our work  @xcite .",
    "however , foregoing work was based on the mass matrices which predicted the sma - msw , so we must investigate the baryogenesis using the present mass matrices , of course , with the modified right - handed majorana mass matrix .",
    "we have reviewed our model which is able to predict the experimentally favored lma - msw solution rather than the sma - msw solution for solar neutrino oscillations after careful choice of the @xmath22 charges for the higgs fields causing transitions between 1st and 2nd generations .",
    "however , the fits of charged lepton quantities become worse compare to our `` old '' model that can predict sma - msw solar neutrino solution . on the other hand",
    ", we now can fit the neutrino quantities very well : the price paid for the greatly improved neutrino mass matrix fit ",
    "the neutrino parameters now contribute only very little to the  is a slight deterioration in the fit to the charged fermion mass matrices .",
    "in particular the predicted values of the quark masses @xmath115 and @xmath116 and the cabibbo angle @xmath79 are reduced compared to our previous fits .",
    "however the overall fit agrees with the seventeen measured quark - lepton mass and mixing angle parameters in table 2 within the theoretically expected uncertainty  @xcite of about @xmath76 ; it is a perfect fit order of magnitudewise .",
    "it should be remarked that our model provides an order of magnitude fit / understanding of all the effective yukawa couplings of the standard model and the neutrino oscillation parameters in terms of only @xmath10 parameters  the higgs field vacuum expectation values !",
