    "microtubules are polar linear polymers that perform major organizational tasks in living cells @xcite . through a unique feature of microtubule assembly ,",
    "termed dynamic instability @xcite , they function as molecular machines @xcite that move cellular structures during processes such as cell reproduction @xcite .",
    "a surprising feature of microtubules is that they remain out of equilibrium under fixed external conditions and can undergo alternating periods of rapid growth and even more rapid shrinking ( fig .",
    "[ l - vs - t ] ) .",
    "these sudden polymerization changes are driven by the interplay between several fundamental processes .",
    "microtubules grow by the attachment of guanosine triphosphate tubulin complexes ( gtp ) at one end @xcite .",
    "structural studies indicate that the end of a microtubule must consist of a `` cap '' of consecutive gtp monomers @xcite for growth to continue @xcite .",
    "once polymerized , the gtp of this complex can irreversibly hydrolyze into guanosine diphosphate ( gdp ) .",
    "if all the monomers in the cap convert to gdp , the microtubule is destabilized and rapid shrinkage ensues by the detachment of gdp tubulin units .",
    "the competition between gtp attachment and hydrolysis from gtp to gdp is believed to lead to the dynamic instability in which the gtp cap hydrolyzes to gdp and then the microtubule rapidly depolymerizes .",
    "the stochastic attachment of gtp can , however , lead to a rescue to the growing phase before the microtubule length shrinks to zero @xcite .",
    "the origin of this dynamic instability has been actively investigated .",
    "one avenue of theoretical work on this dynamical instability is based on models of mechanical stability @xcite .",
    "for example , a detailed stochastic model of a microtubule that includes all the thirteen constituent protofilaments has been investigated in ref .  @xcite . by using model parameters that were inferred from equilibrium statistical physics , vanburen et al .",
    "@xcite found some characteristics of microtubule evolution that agreed with experimental data @xcite .",
    "the disadvantage of this detailed modeling , however , is its complexity , so that it is generally not possible to develop an intuitive understanding of microtubule evolution .",
    "another approach for modeling the dynamics of microtubules is based on effective two - state models that describe the dynamics in terms of a switching between a growing and a shrinking state @xcite .",
    "the essence of many of these models is that a microtubule exists either in a growing phase ( where a gtp cap exists at the end of the microtubule ) or a shrinking phase ( without a gtp cap ) , and that there are stochastic transitions between these two states . by tuning parameters appropriately , it is possible to reproduce the phase changes between the growing and shrinking phases of microtubules that have been observed experimentally @xcite . while the two - state model has the advantage of having only a few parameters , a constant rate of switching between a growing and shrinking microtubule",
    "is built into the model .",
    "thus switching models can not account for the stochastic avalanches and catastrophes that occur in real microtubules .",
    "on the other hand , a minimalist model of microtubule dynamics has been proposed and investigated by flyvbjerg et al .",
    "@xcite . in their model",
    ", they dispense with attempts to capture all of the myriad of experimental parameters within a detailed model , but instead constructed an effective continuous theory to describe microtubule dynamics . their goal was to construct an effective theory that contained as few details as possible .",
    "as stated in ref .",
    "@xcite , they envision that their effective theory should be derivable from a fundamental , microscopic theory and its parameters .",
    "this minimalist modeling is the approach that we adopt in the present work .",
    "we investigate a recently introduced @xcite kinetic model that accounts for many aspects of microtubule evolution .",
    "our main result is that only a few essential parameters with simple physical interpretations are needed to describe the rich features of microtubule growth , catastrophes , and rescues @xcite .",
    "we treat a microtubule as a linear polymer that consists of gtp or gdp monomers that we denote as @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively . to emphasize this connection between chemistry and the model , we will write the former as gtp@xmath2 and the latter as gdp@xmath3 .",
    "the state of a microtubule evolves due to the following three processes :    1 .",
    "attachment : a microtubule grows by attachment of a guanosine triphosphate ( gtp@xmath2 ) monomer .",
    "@xmath4 2 .",
    "conversion : once part of the microtubule , each gtp@xmath2 can independently convert by hydrolysis to a guanosine diphosphate ( gdp@xmath3 ) .",

    "detachment : a microtubule shrinks due to detachment of a gdp@xmath3 monomer _ only from the end of the microtubule_. @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the terminal and the active end of the microtubule .",
    "it is worth mentioning that these steps are similar to those in a recently - introduced model of dna sequence evolution @xcite , and that some of the results about the structure of dna sequences seem to be related to our results about island size distributions in microtubules .     and attachment rates : ( a ) @xmath8 where the microtubule generally remains short , ( b ) @xmath9 , where the length fluctuates strongly , and ( c ) @xmath10 , where the microtubule grows nearly steadily.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=39.0% ]   and attachment rates : ( a ) @xmath8 where the microtubule generally remains short , ( b ) @xmath9 , where the length fluctuates strongly , and ( c ) @xmath10 , where the microtubule grows nearly steadily.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=39.0% ]   and attachment rates : ( a ) @xmath8 where the microtubule generally remains short , ( b ) @xmath9 , where the length fluctuates strongly , and ( c ) @xmath10 , where the microtubule grows nearly steadily.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=39.0% ]    generically , the @xmath11 phase space separates into a region where the microtubule grows ( on average ) with a certain rate @xmath12 , and a compact phase where the average microtubule length is finite .",
    "these two phases are separated by a phase boundary @xmath13 along which the growth rate @xmath12 vanishes . while the behavior of a microtubule for general parameter values is of interest , we will primarily focus on extreme values of the governing parameters where we can obtain a detailed statistical characterization of the microtubule structure . for certain properties , such as the shape of the phase diagram , we will also present results of numerical simulations of the model .    in sec .",

    "our results here are relevant to understanding the distribution of cap length and the diffusion coefficient of the tip of the microtubule in the growth phase .",
    "the predictions of the model in this limit could also be useful in understanding the binding pattern of proteins to microtubules @xcite .",
    "since proteins are important regulatory factors in microtubule polymerization , these results could prove useful in interpreting the effects of proteins on microtubule growth .    by a master equation approach",

    "however , for @xmath187 , each factor in the product is close to 1 and the error made in extending the product to infinity is small .",
    "the expression within the product is obtained under the assumption that the tubule grows steadily between these complete catastrophes and the smaller , local catastrophes , are therefore ignored in this calculation .",
    "the leading asymptotic behavior of the infinite product in is found by expressing it in terms of the dedekind @xmath188 function @xcite @xmath189 and using a remarkable identity satisfied by this function , @xmath190 for our purposes , we define @xmath191 to rewrite this identity as @xmath192 where @xmath193 .",
    "specializing to the case @xmath194 yields @xmath195 since the time between catastrophes scales as the inverse of the occurrence probability , this inter - event time becomes very long for large @xmath21 .      in the instantaneous detachment limit , @xmath184 , the catastrophes are avalanches whose size is determined by the number of gdp@xmath3s between the tip and the first gtp@xmath2 island .",
    "a global catastrophe is an avalanche of size equal to the length of the tubule , whose occurrence probability was calculated in the preceding section .",
    "similar arguments can be used to calculate the size distribution of the smaller avalanches .",
    "since the cap is large when @xmath21 is large , an avalanche of size 1 arises only through the reaction scheme @xmath196 where the first step occurs at rate 1 and the second step is instantaneous .",
    "since attachment proceeds with rate @xmath21 , the probability that conversion occurs before attachment is @xmath197 ; this expression gives the relative frequency of avalanches of sizes @xmath198 .",
    "analogously , an avalanche of size two is formed by the events @xmath199 and the probability that the first two steps occur before an attachment event is @xmath200 to lowest order . at this level of approximation ,",
    "the relative frequency of avalanches of size equal to 1 is @xmath201 .",
    "since we are interested in the regime @xmath88 , we shall only consider the leading term in the avalanche size distribution .    generally an avalanche of size @xmath64 is formed if the system starts in the configuration @xmath202 then @xmath71 contiguous gtp@xmath2 monomers next to the tip convert , and finally the gtp@xmath2 at the tip converts to gdp@xmath3 before the next attachment event .",
    "the probability for the first @xmath71 conversion events is @xmath203 , where the factorial arises because the order of these steps is irrelevant .",

    "the general situation where the attachment and detachment rates , @xmath21 and @xmath15 , have arbitrary values , and where the parameter @xmath14 seems analytically intractable because the master equations for basic observables are coupled to an infinite hierarchy of equations to higher - order variables .",
    "for example , the quantity @xmath70 , the probability for a cap of length zero , satisfies the exact equation @xmath212 and the speed of the tip is @xmath213 here @xmath214 is the probability that there is a gdp@xmath3 at the front position with a gtp@xmath2 on its left .",
    "thus to determine @xmath158 we must find @xmath215 , which then requires higher - order correlation functions , _ etc_. this hierarchical nature prevents an exact analysis and we turn to approximate approaches to map out the behavior in different regions of the parameter space .",
    "for @xmath216 , the conversion gtp@xmath217 gdp@xmath3 at rate one greatly exceeds the rates @xmath218 of the other three basic processes that govern microtubule dynamics .",
    "hence we can assume that conversion is instantaneous .",
    "consequently , the end of a microtubule consists of a string of gdp@xmath3 , @xmath219 , in which the tip advances at rate @xmath155 and retreats at rate @xmath15 .",
