    "the long soft grbs have now been firmly connected to supernova ( sn ) explosions of the type ic ( grb 980425sn 98bw , grb 030329sn 03dh , grb 031203sn 03lw , grb 060218sn 06aj ; see for example * ? ? ?",

    "sn explosions is the collapsar model @xcite . in this model",
    ", the progenitor star must first lose its hydrogen rich envelope during its lifetime but retain enough angular momentum in its core .",
    "the star must also form a black hole when it dies .",
    "the large amount of angular momentum induces the formation of an accretion disk around the black hole .",
    "then accretion from the disk onto the black hole powers bipolar jets .",
    "these jets can only pierce through the outer part of the star and be detected if the star is compact .",
    "this explain why the progenitor star has to lose its hydrogen rich envelope during its lifetime .",
    "additional constraints come from the fact that close - by sn associated grbs are found @xcite in low metallicity ( @xmath0 ) environments , corresponding to the metallicity of the magellanic clouds ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "low metallicity environments are also favoured from the theoretical point of view because lower metallicity means weaker mass loss and therefore smaller angular momentum loss @xcite .",
    "several studies were devoted to finding which stars can lead to grbs @xcite .",
    "the key ingredients of the progenitor models in the context of grbs are the treatment of rotation , magnetic fields , binarity and metallicity . in this work ,",
    "we look at grb progenitors coming from single stars with models , which include the treatment of differential rotation and its transport in the interior .",
    "we focus on the metallicity dependence of the grb rates and discuss the impact of magnetic fields on our results .",
    "the stellar evolution code used for this work is described in @xcite .",
    "convective stability is determined by the schwarzschild criterion .",
    "overshooting is only considered for h and he  burning cores with an overshooting parameter , @xmath4 , of 0.1 h@xmath5 .",
    "the mass loss is proportional to the square root of the metallicity .",
    "it is also dependent on the surface rotation velocity . the centrifugal force is included in the structure equations .",
    "last but not least , the processes taken into account , which induce transport and mixing of angular momentum and matter , are meridional circulation and dynamical and secular shears .",
    "magnetic fields are included only in the models discussed in the section on magnetic fields .",
    "for these models , the treatment of magnetic fields @xcite is included according to @xcite .",
    "models were calculated at various metallicities : @xmath6 ( gc ) , 0.02 ( @xmath7 ) , 0.008 ( lmc ) , 0.004 ( smc ) , and @xmath8 ( second stellar generation ) ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * for more details ) .",
    "our models predict the production of fast rotating bhs . models with large initial masses or high metallicity end with less angular momentum in their central remnant with respect to the break  up limit for the remnant .",
    "many wr star models satisfy the three main criteria ( bh formation , loss of hydrogen  rich envelope and enough angular momentum to form an accretion disk around the black hole ) for long and soft gamma  ray bursts ( grb ) production via the collapsar model @xcite . considering all types of wr stars as grb progenitors , we predict too many grbs compared to observation . if we consider only wo  type wr stars ( type ic supernovae as is the case for the grb related sne discovered so far , see the list in the introduction ) as grb progenitors , the grb production rates are in much better agreement with observations ( see table [ grbrates ] ) . in particular , wo stars are found only at low metallicities ( z@xmath9z@xmath10 ) and have masses , @xmath11 50 @xmath12 .",

    "petrovic et al @xcite and fryer and heger @xcite studied the evolution of single and binary massive stars with and without magnetic fields ( dynamo theory from * ? ? ?",
    "they find that both single and binary models without magnetic field can produce grbs and both single and binary models with magnetic field considered in their studies can not produce grbs . models with magnetic fields nevertheless better reproduce the observed pulsar periods .",
    "the most recent studies found a way to produce grbs in models including magnetic fields .",
    "indeed , @xcite and @xcite find that if a star initially rotates fast enough , it undergoes quasi chemical homogeneous evolution .",
    "the key idea is that wr stars are produced by mixing and not by mass loss .",
    "since wr mass loss rates are too high at metallicities around solar , grbs can only be produced via this channel in low metallicity environments .",

    "+   + _ question by d. fox _ : you have investigated models of isolated massive stars , but many massive stars are born in close binaries . does this affect your results ? + _ answer _ : the presence of a binary companion may either increase mass loss or induce accretion ( at different times ) and spin  up or spin  down a star .",
