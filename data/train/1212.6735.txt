    "a classical theorem of dirac  @xcite states that every graph @xmath0 on @xmath13 vertices with minimum degree @xmath14 contains a hamiltonian cycle . in this paper , we generalise this result to edge - coloured graphs .    an _ edge - coloured graph _ is a graph @xmath0 with an edge colouring  @xmath15 of  @xmath0 .",
