    "there are reasons to expect early - type galaxy ( etg ) star formation histories ( sfhs ) to depend on a galaxy s environment because the efficiency of relevant processes such as quenching by massive haloes ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , cooling flows ( see , e.g. , miller , melott & gorman 1999 ) , and satellite quenching ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) should vary with environment .",
    "thus , studies of differences in the star formation histories of early - type galaxies with environment can provide insight into mechanisms governing the formation and evolution of these galaxies .",
    "however , such studies have yielded somewhat contradictory results .",
    "many of them have suggested that , at a given luminosity , etgs in low - density environments are younger and more metal - rich than those in clusters ( e.g. @xcite ; caldwell , rose & concannon 2003 ; @xcite ) .",
    "there are , however , conflicts with the above results : using a sample of etgs from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , @xcite found galaxies in the most dense environments to be older than their counterparts in the least dense environments by @xmath01 gyr , but found no significant differences in metallicity with environment . also using a sample of etgs from sdss , @xcite found evidence that etgs in low - density environments were less metal - rich than those in high - density environments .",
    "@xcite , studying a sample of etgs drawn from four clusters , found no significant differences in the ages , metallicities , or @xmath3-element abundance ratios between galaxies within clusters and those found in their outskirts . comparing early - type galaxies in clusters and their field contemporaries",
    ", @xcite found no difference in the ages of cluster and field etgs , but found that field etgs were formed over longer time - scales than those in clusters .",
    "it is clear that there is still much to be understood about the relationship between the stellar population properties ( spps ) of early - type galaxies and their environments .",
    "one possible explanation for the contradictions among these results is entanglement between trends in the stellar populations with environment and those with other galaxy parameters .",
    "for example , the above studies distinguished the environments of etgs by comparing galaxies in groups , clusters , and the field .",
    "such an environmental distinction is made ambiguous by known correlations between etg @xmath4 and environment , such that both high - mass , bright red galaxies and low - mass , faint red galaxies are preferentially found in denser environments ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "if the spps show trends with galaxy parameters that are environmentally dependent , such as @xmath4 , then studies comparing the stellar populations of all galaxies at fixed environment vs. those comparing galaxies at , for example , fixed @xmath4 or fixed central stellar velocity dispersion @xmath1 and fixed environment will all give different results .",
    "to zeroth - order , etgs are observed to form a one - dimensional ( 1d ) family with their spps showing strong trends with galaxy mass .",
    "studies have sought to characterize these trends in the stellar populations of etgs along luminosity @xmath5 , @xmath4 , or @xmath1 . in general , these studies have found stellar metallicities to increase with increasing galaxy mass  the well - known mass - metallicity relation ( e.g. @xcite ; smith , lucey & hudson 2007 ; @xcite ) .",
    "these studies have also established that the spps of more massive etgs tend to be older ( to have formed the bulk of their stars at earlier times ) and to have formed over shorter time - scales than their lower - mass counterparts ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this has come to be called ` archaeological downsizing ' .",
    "the results of these studies are consistent with those which demonstrate that @xmath1 is the best predictor of the sfhs of etgs over @xmath5 , @xmath4 , or dynamical mass @xmath6 ( @xcite ; graves , faber & schiavon 2009a , b ; @xcite ; wake , van dokkum & franx 2012 ) .",
    "the sfhs of etgs , however , are not purely a 1d family , but are observed to compose at least a 2-parameter family ( @xcite ; graves , faber & schiavon 2010 ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite showed the stellar populations to map onto the fundamental plane ( fp ) of etgs ( see e.g. @xcite ; jrgensen , franx & kjrgaard 1996 ) such that it is possible to estimate the spps and , thus , the sfhs of quiescent etgs by their locations in fp - space .",
    "the stellar populations of quiescent etgs were shown to scale systematically with two relevant structural parameters : @xmath1 and surface brightness residuals from the fp , @xmath7 .",
    "mean light - weighted age , [ fe / h ] , [ mg / h ] , and [ mg / fe ] all increase with increasing @xmath1 , while at fixed @xmath1 , as @xmath7 increases , [ fe / h ] and [ mg / h ] increase while age and [ mg / fe ] decrease .",
    "these results led the authors to propose a premature truncation model in which the onset time and duration of star formation in quiescent etgs depend on @xmath1 such that higher-@xmath1 galaxies are older and were formed over shorter time - scales , while at fixed @xmath1 , galaxies offset to lower @xmath7 had star formation truncated earlier than those offset to higher @xmath7 .",
    "thus , according to this model , star formation is similar for galaxies at similar @xmath1 , while their spps can still vary according to differences in truncation time , in a way that scales systematically with @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , stellar mass - to - light ratios at fixed @xmath1 are nearly constant @xcite .",
    "thus the @xmath9 variations are primarily variations in stellar mass surface density @xmath10 , and high-@xmath9 galaxies are in fact galaxies with high @xmath10 and ( typically ) high @xmath4 for a given @xmath1 .",
    "if the sfhs of etgs are a 2d family , then studies characterizing trends in the spps with environment at fixed @xmath4 vs. at fixed @xmath1 , for example , will in general yield different and ambiguous results .",
    "we therefore study the environmental dependence of the spps of etgs at fixed position in fp - space ( along fixed structural parameters shown by @xcite to control the sfhs of etgs ) .",
    "this allows us to identify stellar population differences due solely to environment , as opposed to those due also to differences in galaxy structure as a function of environment .",
    "to quantify galaxy environment we use the halo - based group - finding algorithm of @xcite , which assigns individual galaxies to their respective dark matter haloes , assigns halo masses , and distinguishes between the most massive galaxies in groups , and satellites .",
    "previous authors have introduced various other measures of galaxy environment .",
    "two of the most common of these are the projected number density of galaxies above a given magnitude limit ( e.g. @xcite ) and the clustering strength of galaxies using the two - point correlation function ( e.g. @xcite ) or a marked correlation function ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the first of these has the disadvantage that its physical interpretation depends on the environment itself ( see @xcite ) , while the latter has the disadvantage that it assigns halo masses to galaxies in a statistical sense , rather than for individual galaxies @xcite .",
    "we use the halo - based group - finding algorithm of @xcite because it is free of these ambiguities and provides an intuitive measure of an individual galaxy s environment .",
    "@xcite recently used the galaxy group catalogues of @xcite to study differences in local etg spps with environment ( central vs. satellite and group halo mass @xmath11 ) at fixed @xmath1 , and found centrals to have younger ages and significant recent star formation compared to satellites of the same @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite conducted a similar study for local galaxies at fixed @xmath4 , and found satellite galaxies to be older and more metal - rich than centrals at fixed @xmath4 ( we note , however , that comparison of the results we present here with those of @xcite is ambiguous because the authors did not make any morphological or emission cut to their galaxy sample , whereas we study a sample of spectroscopically early - type galaxies ) .",
    "these studies , however , characterized the environmental dependence of the spps only along galaxy mass , whereas we have said that the spps have been shown to comprise at least a 2d family , with at least two structural controlling parameters ( @xmath1 and @xmath9 ) .",
    "we therefore ask a similar question as @xcite and @xcite except , extending upon the work of @xcite , we study differences in the stellar population properties of quiescent early - type galaxies with environment at fixed position in fp - space .",
    "when we compare galaxies at the same place in fp - space , do there exist further trends in these spps with environment ?",
    "the answer to this question has important implications for the formation processes of etgs in different environments , as manifested in their sfhs .",
    "we select a sample of 28,954 quiescent early - type galaxies from the sdss dr7 .",
    "we map these galaxies and their derived stellar population properties age , [ fe / h ] , and [ mg / fe ] onto and through the fundamental plane .",
    "we also divide our galaxy sample into three classifications of environment , derived from the galaxy group catalogues of @xcite . after confirming the trends seen in the spps with the relevant fp parameters by @xcite in our own sample , we then go on to quantify any differences in the spps of our sample with environment at fixed fp position .    in section 2",
    "we describe the data used in this analysis , including sample selection . in section 3",
    "we describe our analysis , including sample classification and stellar population analysis . in section 4",
    "we present our results for variations in the stellar population properties of our quiescent early - type galaxy sample with local group environment at fixed structure . in section 5",
    "we discuss our results in the context of a few late - time evolutionary processes .",
    "finally , section 6 summarizes our conclusions .",
    "the sample of galaxies analysed here are taken from the sdss data release 7 ( dr7 ) main galaxy survey @xcite .",
    "dr7 marks the completion of the survey phase known as sdss - ii .",
    "basic photometric and spectroscopic galaxy properties , including redshifts and stellar velocity dispersions , are taken from the new york university value - added galaxy catalog ( nyu - vagc ; @xcite ) .",
    "following e.g. @xcite , velocity dispersions are aperture corrected to 1/8 effective radius using @xmath12 = @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the circularized radius in arcseconds and @xmath15 is the spectral fiber radius ( 1.5  for sdss spectra ) .",
    "devaucouleurs radii and axis ratios are taken from the sdss dr7 catalog archive server , and are converted to physical radii ( in kpc ) .",
    "radii are circularized using @xmath14 = @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the devaucouleurs radius and axis ratio , respectively .",
    "h@xmath3 , [ oii]@xmath193726 and [ oii]@xmath193729 emission line fluxes and continua are taken from the mpa - jhu spectral catalogs . @xmath20",
    "absolute magnitudes are computed and k - corrected to @xmath21=0 using the idl code @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "galaxy group information ( central vs. satellite , group size , group halo mass ) is taken from the yang et al .",
    "group catalogs .",
    "the sdss dr7 galaxy group catalogue is similar to the sdss dr4 group catalogue of @xcite .",
    "the dr7 group catalogue is constructed by applying the halo - based group finder of @xcite to the nyu - vagc . from the nyu - vagc , yang et al .",
    "selected all galaxies in the main galaxy sample with an extinction - corrected apparent magnitude brighter than @xmath23 = 17.72 , with redshifts in the range 0.01 @xmath24 @xmath21 @xmath24 0.20 and with a redshift completeness @xmath25 @xmath26 0.7 .",
    "of the three group samples yang et al .",
    "construct from this parent sample , we use sample ii .",
    "in addition to the 599,301 galaxies in sample i with measured @xmath23-band magnitudes and redshifts from sdss , sample ii includes 3,269 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts taken from alternative surveys .",
    "our sample contains galaxies restricted to a redshift range 0.025 @xmath27 @xmath21 @xmath27 0.1 and a @xmath1 range 70 ( km / s ) @xmath27",
    "@xmath21 @xmath27 300 ( km / s ) . where necessary we assume a standard @xmath28cdm cosmology with @xmath29=73 km / s / mpc , @xmath30=0.25 , and @xmath31=0.75 .",
    "in the present analysis we study the star formation histories of quiescent early - type galaxies .",
    "we construct our quiescent , early - type galaxy sample by making cuts in the spectral emission features and colors of our parent galaxy sample .",
    "our emission line cuts are based on h@xmath3 and [ oii]@xmath193727 , which are typically the two strongest optical emission lines in star - forming galaxies .",
    "this cut also eliminates contamination from low - ionization nuclear emission - line regions ( liners ) , which exhibit high [ oii]/h@xmath3 ratios , and galaxies which exhibit low [ oii]/h@xmath3 ratios , including active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , transition objects ( tos ) , and seyferts @xcite .",
    "these cuts largely parallel those made in @xcite .",
    "figure [ cuts]@xmath32 shows the distribution of the full @xmath33 galaxy sample in h@xmath3 and [ oii ] equivalent width ( ew ) , zoomed in around the region of galaxies with zero emission .",
    "the quiescent galaxies used in the present analysis are those that lie near the peak of the distribution around zero emission in both h@xmath3 and [ oii ] .",
    "the population of truly quiescent galaxies should be symmetrically distributed around ( 0,0 ) , with scatter due to measurement errors in the emission line strengths .",
    "there may be zero - point offsets in the ew measurements ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and the typical errors in h@xmath3 ew are different from those in [ oii ] . with these effects in mind ,",
    "we determine the ew zero - point values and selection region as follows .",
    "we smooth over the distribution of galaxies in the h@xmath3-[oii ] ew - space by taking its two - dimensional histogram .",
    "we isolate quiescent galaxies in this space by fitting a gaussian with zero tilt around the distribution peak .",
    "this gaussian fit is centred at ( 0.184,0.318 ) , which we take to indicate the zero - point of the ew measurements .",
    "the gaussian widths are 0.598 @xmath34 and 0.168 @xmath34 in [ oii ] and h@xmath3 ew , respectively .",
    "we then make a cut in emission to the galaxy population in ew - space : selected galaxies are those whose measured values @xmath351@xmath1 lie within the ellipse centred at ( 0.184,0.318 ) with width and height equal to 4 times the gaussian widths of the quiescent distribution .",
    "these selection criteria minimize contamination from galaxies with significant h@xmath3 and [ oii ] emission , while still maintaining a large enough sample for later analysis .",
    "the galaxies which meet these criteria are shown in green in figure [ cuts]@xmath32 , while the distribution of those which are eliminated from our sample by the ew selection is shown with contour lines .",
    "figure [ cuts]@xmath32 also shows ellipses centred at the gaussian centre of the quiescent distribution whose semimajor and semiminor axes are 1,3 , and 4 times the gaussian widths of the quiescent distribution . making our cut is roughly equivalent to making a cut such that galaxies lie within the 3@xmath1 ellipse with no consideration of their errors in emission .    after this emission cut we make a further cut in color - magnitude space to remove color outliers .",
    "this identifies contaminants to our passive sample , e.g. , galaxies where the emission line measurements have failed .",
    "we first define the red sequence of our full galaxy sample in @xmath36 vs. @xmath37 color - magnitude space ( figure [ cuts]@xmath38 ) in the following way .",
    "we again take a two dimensional histogram of the galaxy distribution , this time in ( @xmath36 ) vs. @xmath37 space .",
    "we then fit a two - dimensional gaussian function with nonzero tilt to the galaxy distribution centred around the red sequence .",
    "we define the centre of the red sequence in color - magnitude space to be along a line connecting the major axes of ellipses that are the level sets of our 2d - gaussian fit to the red sequence .",
    "we then define a line parallel to this red sequence , offset below it by 2@xmath39 ( solid line in figure [ cuts]@xmath38 ) , where @xmath39=0.021 is the gaussian width of the red - sequence distribution along the direction perpendicular to the red sequence line .",
    "galaxies that lie below this solid line are discarded .",
    "our cut is illustrated in figure [ cuts]@xmath38 , where our parent sample of galaxies is shown in color - magnitude space separated into three subpopulations : the distribution of galaxies which were eliminated by our emission cuts is shown with contour lines ; galaxies which passed the emission cuts but not the color cuts are shown in green ; galaxies which passed both cuts and define our final quiescent red - sequence sample are shown in blue . a visual inspection of the spectra for objects plotted in green ( those with no emission but blue colors ) showed that many of them contain significant emission and thus represent errors in the mpa - jhu emission line measurements or mismatches between the catalogs .",
    "our color cuts yield a sample that is not significantly contaminated by objects lying off the red sequence .",
    "after all the cuts described above we are left with a sample of 28,954 galaxies .",
    "in the present analysis we study how the stellar population properties and , thus , the star formation histories of quiescent early - type galaxies relate to their present - day structural properties and local group environments . in order to understand how these sfhs scale with present - day structural properties we study their variation along and ` through ' the thickness of the fundamental plane .    here",
    "we describe our 3d fp binning strategy .",
    "we follow the method of @xcite by dividing galaxies into this space directly using the fp parameters @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .",
    "although these parameters are not orthogonal , we use them as bases and bin galaxies in this space because we can more directly interpret the structural properties of galaxies in our sample by their locations in this space .    we construct the @xmath7 dimension ( thickness ) of our fp - space by fitting a plane to the @xmath42-@xmath40-@xmath41 relation .",
    "this fit uses the routine @xmath43 in the package @xmath44 in python to minimize residuals in the @xmath42 direction .",
    "we find the following fp relation from this fit : @xmath45 where @xmath9 is measured in @xmath46 @xmath47 , @xmath1 is measured in km s@xmath48 , and @xmath49 is measured in kpc .",
    "the fp residual , @xmath50 , is the difference between the measured @xmath51 and that expected from the fp fit , i.e. , @xmath50 @xmath52 @xmath42 - ( @xmath53 - @xmath54 - @xmath55 ) . an edge - on view of the fp is shown in figure [ edge ] .    as demonstrated in @xcite ,",
    "the thickness in @xmath7 of the fp is predominantly the result of variations in the stellar surface mass density @xmath10 .",
    "this can be interpreted as a conversion efficiency for turning gas into stars . in order to study variations in the spps with @xmath7",
    ", we define three layers through the fp by dividing @xmath50 into three ` slices ' : ` low - sb ' ( @xmath50 @xmath24 -0.059 ) , ` mid - sb ' ( -0.059 @xmath27 @xmath50 @xmath27 0.059 ) , and ` high - sb ' ( @xmath50 @xmath56 0.059 ) .",
    "the three layers along the @xmath42 dimension , separating galaxies in this space into low- , mid- , and high - sb are indicated by black lines in figure [ edge ] .    in each of the three surface brightness slices",
    ", we then bin galaxies into a 6@xmath575 grid in the @xmath49-@xmath1 projection of the fp ( see any panel of figures [ age ] through [ mg_fe ] ) .",
    "this yields 30 bins of galaxies in the @xmath49-@xmath1 space , and a total of 90 bins of galaxies in our 3d fp - space defined by the three parameters @xmath9 , @xmath49 , and @xmath1 .",
    "this @xmath49-@xmath1 projection of fp - space also conveys important information about the structures of our galaxy sample . by fixing the position of a galaxy in this projection of fp - space we fix its total mass ( @xmath6 @xmath58 @xmath59 ) , and by varying the position of a galaxy along a line of constant @xmath6 we vary its size and concentration .",
    "this fp - space provides a description of a galaxy s structure along which we can study changes in the sfhs of our galaxy sample in different environments .",
    "this analysis aims to study the role of local group environment in the star formation histories of early - type galaxies .",
    "here we use ` local group environment ' to refer to a galaxy s ` identity ' within its dark matter halo , i.e. , whether it is the central most massive galaxy within a halo hosting other less massive galaxies , a smaller satellite galaxy within the halo of a more massive host galaxy , or the only galaxy in its dark matter halo .",
    "this provides an intuitive measure of an individual galaxy s environment .",
    "we ask the question whether , when we fix quiescent etgs by their locations in fp - space ( along the structural parameters shown by @xcite to be well - correlated to their sfhs ) , their spps are seen to vary with their local group environments .",
    "to describe local group environment we classify galaxies into three categories : ` brightest group galaxies ' ( bggs ) are defined as the single most massive galaxies residing in groups containing more than one galaxy ; satellites are defined as those galaxies that are not the most massive in a group containing more than one galaxy ( they reside in the dark matter halo of the host galaxy ) ; isolateds are those galaxies that are the only members of the dark matter haloes in which they reside . by defining these three group classifications",
    "we further divide our 90 bins in fp - space into a total of 270 bins .    to make these classifications we use the dr7 version of the group catalogue of @xcite .",
    "the yang group catalogue is constructed using a halo - based group finder , which establishes groups by assigning individual galaxies to their respective dark matter haloes .",
    "the halo - based group finder does this by first making tentative group assignments using the traditional fof algorithm of @xcite , then assigning a tentative mass to each group with an assumption of the group mass - to - light ratio .",
    "this mass is then used to estimate the size and velocity dispersion of the host halo , which is then used to redetermine group membership in redshift space .",
    "this process is iterated until group membership converges . for a full description of the group finding algorithm and the basic properties of the group catalogue",
    "please see the description of the earlier dr4 group catalogue @xcite .",
    "we use the dr7 group catalogue rather than the dr4 group catalogue because it gives us a larger sample size .",
    "our 3d fp - space , divided into bggs , isolateds , and satellites , contains 270 bins of galaxies . for each of these 270 bins , we co - add the spectra of the individual galaxies within the bin to make a very high s / n stacked spectrum .",
    "the individual spectra are normalized in the 40005500 wavelength region and combined in an unweighted sum , so that each constituent galaxy contributes equally to the final stack .",
    "we mask out regions around strong skylines , and perform pixel - by - pixel @xmath1-clipping to remove distant outliers .",
    "we smooth all the spectra up to a common effective velocity dispersion to match the resolution of the highest-@xmath1 galaxy within each bin .",
    "corresponding error spectra are constructed in parallel .",
    "the total s / n varies , depending on the number of galaxies that contribute to each bin .",
    "we note that prior to stacking , galaxy spectra are not corrected for galactic foreground extinction , which is expected to have a negligible effect .",
    "after our cuts in emission and in color - magnitude space , we are still left with a small number of galaxies that contain significant emission , whose catalog emission values do not correctly reflect the properties of the spectra .",
    "these are a small fraction of the total galaxies .",
    "thus in bins containing many galaxies , the emission lines are effectively excluded by the @xmath1-clipping algorithm . however , in bins with relatively few galaxies , no pixels are removed by @xmath1-clipping and the mis - identified objects can contribute substantial emission to the stack . to eliminate these objects ,",
    "we make iterative manual checks to the stacked stellar spectra for each bin .",
    "if any substantial emission is seen in the stacked spectrum , we visually inspect the spectrum of each individual galaxy belonging to that bin , eliminating from our sample those galaxies whose spectra show significant emission that was not reflected in their catalog emission line values .",
    "these iterative checks remove 36 galaxies from our sample of @xmath029,000 galaxies .",
    "the stacked spectra for each bin can be used to characterize the stellar population properties that are typical for galaxies in that bin .",
    "we use the idl code ez_ages @xcite , based on the stellar population synthesis models of @xcite , to measure single burst ages , [ fe / h ] , and [ mg / fe ] for each stacked spectrum .",
    "briefly , ez_ages uses balmer and fe absorption lines to fix a fiducial age and [ fe / h ] for the spectrum , based on solar - abundance model grids .",
    "it then adjusts the abundance of [ mg / fe ] with respect to this solar - scale model until the model can consistently fit the mg _ b _ absorption feature as well .",
    "the code then iterates to ensure a self - consistent solution .",
    "other absorption lines can be used to fit other elements , but here we restrict ourselves to fitting age , [ fe / h ] , and [ mg / fe ] .",
    "ez_ages also provides error estimates for these parameters , based on the formalism of @xcite , which has been shown to be consistent with the error estimates from monte carlo simulations @xcite . for more details on the modeling process",
    ", we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "the resulting stellar population measurements give a light - weighted single - burst age , mean [ fe / h ] , and [ mg / fe ] .",
    "each of these parameters contains information about the star formation histories of the galaxies in question .",
    "the measured stellar population ages are derived from model star formation histories that consist of a single burst of star formation .",
    "single burst models are not realistic representations of galaxy star formation histories , and certainly not for a stack of many galaxies . thus the single burst ages quoted here are used as statistical descriptions of the ensemble of stars in a galaxy bin in order to make quantitative comparisons between bins , without assuming that the measured ages correspond to a rigorous physical formation time .",
    "the reader should bear in mind that the stars in any given galaxy bin likely formed over a range of times .",
    "furthermore , the single - burst ages are not equivalent to mean mass - weighted ages but instead are strongly skewed by young sub - populations @xcite .",
    "they thus capture information about whether or not a galaxy has formed a substantial quantity of stars in the recent past .",
    "we use the fe abundance [ fe / h ] to quantify the overall normalization of the metal abundance pattern in our stacked galaxies . again , these are mean quantities over an ensemble of metallicities , although these are much more nearly mass - weighted quantities @xcite .",
    "because the nucleosynthesis of fe is dominated by type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) , [ fe / h ] measures the quantity of sne ia product that has built up during a galaxy s star forming lifetime through previous generations of stars .",
    "finally , we use [ mg / fe ] to trace the typical duration of star formation in our galaxies .",
    "the nucleosynthesis of mg is dominated by massive stars and type ii supernovae ( sne ii ) , which have shorter lifetimes than the stellar progenitors of sne ia .",
    "thus an excess of mg with respect to fe is often interpreted to mean that star formation in a galaxy was of short duration , such that the interstellar medium ( ism ) had time to enrich in sne ii product ( mg ) , but not to fully enrich in sne ia product ( fe ) ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; worthey , faber & gonzlez 1992 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the results of our analysis are shown in figures [ age ] through [ mg_fe ] . here",
    "we show the final galaxy sample in 3d fp - space , separated into bggs , isolateds , and satellites .",
    "each panel shown in figures [ age ] through [ mg_fe ] shows the @xmath49-@xmath1 projection of fp - space . in each of these figures",
    "the top , middle , and bottom rows of panels show galaxies in our high- , mid- , and low - sb fp slices , respectively .",
    "the left , middle , and right columns show our isolated , bgg , and satellite galaxy samples , respectively .",
    "the spps age , [ fe / h ] , and [ mg / fe ] for each bin in this space are shown by the color in which a galaxy is plotted , according to the scale shown by the colorbar in each figure . in the top",
    ", leftmost panels of figures [ age ] through [ mg_fe ] , a dashed red line of constant dynamical mass @xmath6 is shown .",
    "looking first at the distribution of galaxies in the binned space , we notice that bggs are distributed differently from the satellite and isolated populations . in a given surface brightness slice bggs tend to populate the high-@xmath1 , high-@xmath49 part of fp - space , where we expect to find the most massive galaxies ( recall that @xmath6 @xmath58 @xmath59 for a virialized system ) .",
    "it is no surprise that bggs tend to be more massive than satellites ; this is built into their definition .",
    "that bggs also tend to be more massive than isolateds is not directly definitional , and illustrates that more massive haloes tend to host more massive central galaxies .",
    "we confirm all of the previous trends observed in the spps of quiescent etgs with their positions in fp - space ( see @xcite ) .",
    "studying figures [ age ] through [ mg_fe ] , the following trends are unanimously true for bggs , isolateds , and satellites . along the direction of increasing @xmath1 , the ages , [ fe / h ] , and [ mg / fe ] of galaxies in our sample are observed to increase . along the direction of decreasing @xmath7 , the ages and [ mg / fe ] of galaxies in our sample",
    "are observed to increase , while their [ fe / h ] are observed to decrease .",

    "there are slight shifts in the stellar population properties of quiescent early - type galaxies with local group environment on top of the zeroth - order trends with structure .",
    "these are the following : there are modest shifts in age at fixed structure , such that age@xmath71 @xmath26 age@xmath72 @xmath26 age@xmath73 .",
    "there are @xmath74 slight shifts in fe - enrichment at fixed structure , such that [ fe / h]@xmath72 @xmath26 [ fe / h]@xmath71 = [ fe / h]@xmath73 .",
    "there are no shifts between the mg - enhancements of bgg , isolated , and satellite galaxies at fixed structure .",
    "before we discuss the implications of our results at fixed fp - position , we study variation in the spps with local group environment at fixed @xmath1 .",
    "this allows us to more clearly place our results at fixed fp - position in the context of previous studies , which have typically studied the sfhs of etgs at fixed galaxy mass .",
    "we measure the ages , [ fe / h ] , and [ mg / fe ] for the spectra of bgg , isolated , and satellite galaxies stacked separately in bins of @xmath1 .",
    "our results are shown in figures [ sig_age ] through [ sig_mg_fe ] .    at fixed @xmath1 ,",
    "satellites are older than bggs and isolateds by @xmath00.1 dex ( figure [ sig_age ] ) .",
    "bggs are more fe - rich than satellites at fixed @xmath1 by @xmath00.04 dex ( figure [ sig_fe_h ] ) .",
    "the shifts seen in the spps between bgg and satellite galaxies at fixed fp - position are much stronger at fixed @xmath1 .",
    "there are no significant shifts in [ mg / fe ] with environment at fixed fp - position or at fixed @xmath1 ( figure [ sig_mg_fe ] ) .",
    "comparison of the spps of bggs and satellites with those of isolateds in figures [ sig_age ] through [ sig_mg_fe ] is ambiguous because trends in the spps with galaxy structural parameters are not fully controlled",
    ". we can more clearly interpret shifts between the spps of bggs and satellites at fixed @xmath1 because the definitions of these galaxy subpopulations relative to each other directly indicate how they will distribute differently across the fp at fixed @xmath1 : bggs , by definition , are more massive and brighter  and so tend to have higher values of @xmath9  than satellites at fixed @xmath1 .",
    "this implies that at fixed @xmath1 , regardless of any true variation in the spps with environment , bggs tend to be offset to younger ages and higher [ fe / h ] than satellites .",
    "this effect is added to true variation in the spps with environment .",
    "thus , the age and [ fe / h ] shifts between satellites and bggs is stronger at fixed @xmath1 than it is at fixed fp - position  in fp - space we control all these important structural parameters at once and study differences in sfh with environment that are independent of structure .",
    "the central result of our analysis is that , to zeroth - order , the star formation histories of quiescent early - type galaxies are observed to be fully captured by their structures .",
    "the observed strong correlation between sfh and structure has strong implications for the evolution of quiescent etgs after their initial formation and main star - forming lifetimes . in interpreting our results",
    ", we note that our sample consists of relatively old galaxies that were possibly quenched long ago , which may make environmental effects on the sfhs difficult to identify , in addition to their intrinsic subtleness . in considering slight differences in the sfhs with environment one",
    "should also be careful to note that we have not matched the halo mass distributions between bggs , satellites , and isolateds within each bin in fp - space .",
    "this is most important when considering bgg and satellite galaxies , which according to their definitions cover different ranges of halo masses at fixed galaxy mass .    in the following discussion ,",
    "we use the term ` late - time processes ' to describe those evolutionary processes which a galaxy undergoes after its initial formation and main star - forming lifetime . for quiescent etgs , late - time processes may include the quenching of star formation and processes such as dry merging which occur after quenching . `",
    "early - time ' processes are those which precede sf quenching .",
    "the observed sfh - structure correlation can result from two possible scenarios . either ( 1 ) sfh and structure of a galaxy are both built in at early times , and are not changed very much by late - time evolutionary processes , or ( 2 ) late - time evolution can significantly change both the sfhs and structures of quiescent etgs , but this happens conspiratorially in a way that preserves the observed sfh - structure correlation .",
    "the possibility that the latter of these scenarios occurs seems unlikely ; in particular , because we do not see strong variations in sfh with environment , this scenario would require all late - time environmental processes to follow this same ` conspiracy ' .",
    "on the other hand , the first scenario is a plausible explanation of our observations .",
    "our results therefore substantially constrain the effects that late - time evolutionary processes can have on the structures and sfhs of quiescent etgs . in the following sections , we discuss the implications of this conclusion for a number of evolutionary processes .",
    "@xcite suggested that satellite quenching might drive the trends they observed in the spps of quiescent etgs with @xmath7 .",
    "satellite quenching describes processes by which satellites that fall into their host haloes are stripped of cold gas out of which to form stars ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "satellite quenching has been suggested as an important mechanism causing the observed dependence of galaxy star formation rate ( sfr ) and color on small scale environment ( @xmath75 1 mpc ) , in which the fraction of red galaxies with low sfr increases with local density of environment ( e.g. wilman , zibetti & budavri 2010 ; tinker , wetzel & conroy 2011 ) . @xcite considered the quenching of star formation of satellite galaxies by strangulation as they fall into their host haloes to explain the shift they observed of satellites to older ages than centrals at fixed @xmath4 in their sdss galaxy sample .",
    "if the quenching of infalling satellites were the dominant mechanism driving the @xmath8 trends , this would imply that low-@xmath7 galaxies tend to be satellite galaxies in the dark matter haloes of larger host galaxies .",
    "it further implies that satellites offset to lowest @xmath7 are those which fell into their host haloes at the earliest times @xcite .",
    "the data presented here can rule out the quenching of infalling satellites as a main mechanism driving the observed trends with @xmath7 .",
    "considering the bottom panels of figure [ age ] , it is clear that the low-@xmath7 galaxies include bgg , isolated , and satellite galaxies in similar proportion to what is observed for high- and mid-@xmath7 galaxies .",
    "thus , the low-@xmath8 population is not especially dominated by satellites .",
    "although satellite quenching is not the main mechanism driving the observed trends in the spps with @xmath7 , our results are still consistent with the presence of some quenching of infalling satellites . in particular ,",
    "our observed slight shifts in the ages of satellites above bggs and isolateds at fixed structure might be due in part to the quenching of these satellites as they fall into their host haloes .",
    "if the quenching of infalling satellites is indeed the mechanism causing the observed age offset , then we might expect satellites to also be offset to lower [ fe / h ] and higher [ mg / fe ] than isolated galaxies , consistent with a mechanism that truncates the star formation of satellite galaxies more efficiently than that of isolated galaxies .",
    "we do not , however , observe either of these shifts .",
    "in fact , we observe that [ fe / h]@xmath71 = [ fe / h]@xmath73 , and that [ mg / fe]@xmath71 = [ mg / fe]@xmath73 .",
    "this indicates that if satellite quenching is the mechanism causing the shift of satellites to older ages than isolateds and bggs , this must only be a weak and late effect that takes place after a satellite galaxy has been forming fe - peak elements for a significant period of time .",
    "this is also consistent with satellite quenching which occurs over a long time period , rather than abruptly .",
    "this is indeed suggested by the results of @xcite , who , using galaxy group / cluster catalogs from the sdss dr7 together with a cosmological n - body simulation , find that there is a long time delay ( 24 gyr ) in which , after a satellite galaxy falls into its host dark matter halo , satellite sfrs evolve unaffected before an ensuing period of rapid quenching with a characteristic time - scale @xmath270.8 gyr .",
    "the presence of slow , weak satellite quenching in our sample is thus consistent with the observed trends in age , [ fe / h ] , and [ mg / fe ] with local group environment . that satellite quenching can have only a subtle effect on galaxies in our sample , in a way consistent with the zeroth - order preservation of their sfhs / structures , implies that the mechanisms responsible for quenching satellites after they fall into their host dark matter haloes can not significantly alter the structures of satellite galaxies .",
    "this is supported by the results of @xcite , who , using a large galaxy group catalog constructed from sdss , suggest that ` strangulation ' ( larson , tinsley & caldwell 1980 ; balogh , navarro & morris 2000 ) is the main mechanism turning satellite galaxies red , dominating over mechanisms which operate only in very massive haloes , such as ` ram - pressure stripping ' ( e.g. @xcite ; quilis , moore & bower 2000 ; @xcite ) and ` harrasment ' ( @xcite ) , the latter of which can have a significant impact on galaxy morphology .",
    "the efficiency of cooling flows in our sample might be expected to differ with local group environment , and could impact the observed sfhs .",
    "cooling flows significantly affect only the galaxy at the bottom of the gravitational potential well of its halo , and so should only be relevant for bgg and isolated galaxies .",
    "late - time star formation has commonly been observed in ` cooling core ' bcgs with low central gas entropies , identified by their x - ray luminosities and excess ir and uv emission ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in analogy to the bcgs in clusters , we might expect to see subtle shifts in bggs to younger ages than isolateds , as a result of more efficient gas cooling flows powering residual late - time star formation for central bgg galaxies .",
    "this is consistent with observations which find galaxy clusters with the most massive cooling flows to have significantly closer nearest neighbors than the typical cluster ( loken , melott & miller 1999 ) .",
    "this could be driven by a positive correlation between cluster nearest - neighbor overdensity and central gas density @xcite . by definition",
    ", bggs should reside in regions of higher nearest - neighbor overdensity than isolateds and have higher central gas density than isolateds , and could therefore have more efficient cooling flows .",
    "we note that we have eliminated ongoing star formation from our sample , but this only eliminates continuous residual late - time star formation , and any residual star - formation that shut down recently will still affect our results .",
    "we do not , however , observe bggs to be offset to younger ages at fixed structure than isolateds and , in fact , the slight shift we do see is an offset of bggs to slightly @xmath76 ages than isolateds at fixed structure . not only do we not see evidence for significant late - time residual star formation from more efficient cooling flows for bggs in our sample , but the slight shift is in the opposite direction from what one might expect if this were the case . we conclude that cooling flows do not have a major impact on the integrated sfhs of bggs in our sample .",
    "the observed small offset of bggs to slightly older ages than isolateds could be due to more efficient late - time residual star formation for isolateds . in this case , a possible mechanism causing this could be quenching by massive haloes .",
    "this occurs when the dark matter halo of a galaxy passes a critical mass threshold and accreting gas is shock heated upon infall , no longer cooling efficiently ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the interaction of the accreting gas with the rapidly expanding shock has been shown to be enough for long - term quenching in haloes of 10@xmath77 to 10@xmath78 ( birnboim , dekel & neistein 2007 ) .",
    "it has also been shown that long - term quenching in massive ( @xmath79 7@xmath5710@xmath77m@xmath80 ) haloes can result if shock heating is supplemented by continued cosmological gas accretion which delivers gravitational energy to the inner halo hot gas @xcite .    at fixed structure of the central galaxy , we expect bggs to reside in more massive dark matter haloes than isolateds because they are defined as having a larger total group mass .",
    "it is possible that gas accretion onto isolateds is more efficient , while shock heating slows or quenches star formation for bggs in more massive haloes .",
    "this could cause our observed slight shift of bggs to older ages than isolateds at fixed structure .",
    "we note that this mechanism is thought only to be effective when the dark matter halo of a galaxy passes beyond a critical mass threshold @xmath81 . in order to test this further",
    ", it would be interesting in later similar analyses to systematically determine how the spps of quiescent etgs scale with local group environment at fixed structure , distinguishing by galaxy halo mass .",
    "besides a slight age shift , we also see a very slight shift of bggs to higher [ fe / h ] than isolateds and satellites . in a way that is consistent with the critical halo mass quenching arguments above , the observed shift in [ fe / h ] of bggs",
    "can also be explained by their larger mass haloes at fixed structure .",
    "if , at fixed structure , bggs have more massive haloes than isolateds , the [ fe / h ] offset of bggs could result from bggs being slightly less susceptible to sn feedback , retaining a larger fraction of their metals in the deeper gravitational potential wells in which they reside .",
    "the effects of differences in the halo masses of bggs and isolateds on their sfhs and structures can not be large , as implied by the only slight shifts seen in the sfhs of galaxies in our sample with environment , in a way that is consistent with the zeroth - order preservation of structure and sfh .",
    "we would expect the rate of dissipationless ( ` dry ' ) merging in our galaxy sample to depend on environment .",
    "in particular , we might expect the rate of dry minor merging to be greater for bggs .",
    "this is consistent with the results of @xcite who suggests that more dry minor merging in the formation histories of bcgs ( analogous to our bggs ) causes their steeper @xmath49-@xmath5 relation over other etgs in the sdss , maxbcg @xcite , and c4 @xcite catalogues .",
    "@xcite , performing high - resolution cosmological simulations , also find bcgs to evolve away from the kormendy relation for smaller mass galaxies and to show increased dark matter - to - stellar mass ratios , due to a larger number of dry mergers in their formation histories . because dry merger rates in our sample are expected to vary with environment , our observation of the zeroth - order preservation of sfh - structure constrains the degree to which dry merging can alter galaxy structure without ` equally ' altering the spps .",
    "naab , johansson & ostriker ( 2009 ) and @xcite present simple scaling arguments to discuss the effects of dry mergers on etg structure .",
    "these scaling arguments have agreed reasonably well with the results of simulations ( e.g. oser et al .",
    "2012 ; boylan - kolchin , ma & quataert 2006 ) . using the virial theorem , and assuming energy conservation between the compact initial stellar system and the final system after accretion of additional stellar systems , @xcite derives the following relation between the final and initial mean square speeds of stars : @xmath82 and a similar relation between the final and initial gravitational radii : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the ratio of the total mass of accreted systems to the initial mass ( @xmath84 = @xmath85 ) , and @xmath86 is the ratio of the average of the mean square speeds of accreted systems and the initial mean square speed ( @xmath86 = @xmath87 ) .",
    "these scaling arguments predict that the remnant @xmath88 in a dry major merger doubles for a factor - of-2 increase in mass while its @xmath1 is left unchanged . referring to equation [ fp_eq ] ,",
    "if dry major mergers increase @xmath88 linearly with mass , then they would leave the structural parameters relevant to the sfhs of galaxies in our sample relatively unchanged . because they also occur between galaxies of similar structure ( and sfh ) , dry major mergers are consistent with our observation of the zeroth - order preservation of sfh - structure .",
    "the @xcite and @xcite scaling arguments predict that for a factor - of-2 increase in mass due to dry minor merging , @xmath88 increases by a factor of 4 and @xmath1 decreases by a factor of @xmath89 . again referring to equation [ fp_eq ] , we find that , according to these scaling arguments , enough dry minor merging can significantly alter the relevant structural parameters of galaxies in our sample ( decreasing their @xmath1 and shifting them to lower @xmath9 ) . because we expect dry minor mergers to leave the spps of the most massive progenitor relatively unchanged , a large amount of dry minor merging would ` wash out ' the observed sfh - structure correlations , in disagreement with the data .",
    "this constrains the rates of dry minor mergers in our sample and the degree to which they can alter galaxy structure .",
    "limitations on dry minor merger rates and structural effects provided by our observations could possibly conflict with studies which favor dry minor merging as a mechanism to explain the observed size growth ( up to a factor of @xmath05 since a redshift of @xmath02 ) of elliptical galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ; trujillo , ferreras & de la rosa 2011 ; @xcite ; hilz , naab & ostriker 2013 ; @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , as our observations might suggest , recent studies have found that the observed size growth of etgs can not be fully attributed to dry minor mergers ( nipoti , treu & bolton 2009a ; @xcite ; cimatti , nipoti & cassata 2012 ) .",
    "@xcite , using n - body simulations , found dry major and minor mergers together to increase the half - light radii and velocity dispersions of etgs with @xmath4 as @xmath49 @xmath58 @xmath90 and @xmath1 @xmath58 @xmath91 .",
    "based on their simulations , the authors determined that if high - redshift etgs are indeed as dense as estimated , they can not have evolved into present - day etgs via dry merging alone .",
    "in particular , the authors found that present - day etgs can not have assembled more than @xmath045@xmath60 of their stellar mass via dry mergers , and even this upper limit requires extreme fine tuning ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we note that on average the sdss fiber only samples the inner 0.78@xmath49 of galaxies in our sample , and only samples @xmath240.5@xmath49 for @xmath020@xmath60 of our sample .",
    "dry minor mergers are expected to accrete material at large radii in a galaxy , forming extended stellar envelopes of low - density material ( e.g. @xcite ; farouki , shapiro & duncan 1983 ; @xcite ) , but may have a minimal effect on the central regions of a galaxy ( e.g. @xcite ) . in particular",
    ", @xcite found that although the effective stellar mass surface densities within @xmath49 ( @xmath92 ) of local massive ellipticals ( @xmath2610@xmath93 ) is much smaller than those of their high - redshift counterparts , the physical stellar surface densities at the observed radii @xmath015 kpc are comparable between low- and high - redshift massive ellipticals .",
    "evidence was found for a picture in which the entire population of high - redshift red galaxies are the progenitors of the high - density cores of present - day massive ellipticals , whose growth is primarily through dissipationless minor mergers .",
    "@xcite found similar results .",
    "thus , although it does not entirely lift any constraint our observations have on the rates and effects of dry minor merging allowed for in our sample ( in particular , the full @xmath49 is sampled by the sdss aperture for @xmath050@xmath60 of galaxies in our sample ) , any attempt to place a limit on the effects of dry minor merging in our sample must consider the effect of finite sdss aperture size .",

    "there are only slight trends in sfh with environment .",
    "although satellite quenching is found not to be the main mechanism causing the truncation sequence observed along the @xmath7 dimension of fp - space , as proposed by @xcite , our observation that satellites are slightly offset to older ages than bggs and isolateds is consistent with a weak , slow satellite quenching process .",
    "although we do not see any slight offset of bggs to younger ages than isolateds , as one might expect from cooling flows , this could be due to quenching in the more massive haloes in which bggs reside .",
    "the strong sfh - structure correlation we observe may well be inconsistent with a large amount of dry minor merging in our sample .",
    "future numerical simulations are needed to place quantitative constraints on the degree to which dry minor merging can affect our galaxy sample .",

    "<S> we find that the sfhs of quiescent etgs are almost entirely determined by their structural parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> any variation with local group environment at fixed structure is only slight : satellites have the oldest stellar populations , 0.02 dex older than bggs and 0.04 dex older than isolateds ; bggs have the highest fe - enrichments , 0.01 dex higher than isolateds and 0.02 dex higher than satellites ; there are no differences in mg - enhancement between bggs , isolateds , and satellites . </S>",
