    "supernova ( sn )  2010jl was discovered on 2010 nov .  3.52 ( ut dates are used throughout this paper ) by newton & pucket ( 2010 ) . with a discovery magnitude of 13.5 ( unfiltered ) , this is one of the brightest supernovae ( sne ) in recent years .",
    "after one day it continued to brighten ( 12.9 mag on 2010 nov .",
    "4.50 ) , signaling that this sn was also caught early in its evolution .",
    "moreover , its host galaxy ugc  5189a is located at a distance of almost 50 mpc , suggesting that sn  2010jl is intrinsically very luminous , with an absolute magnitude of about @xmath020 at a time when it was still becoming brighter .",
    "early - time spectra showed that it is a type  iin sn ( benetti et al .",
    "2010 ; see filippenko 1997 for a review of sn types ) .",
    "although sne  iin constitute about 69% of core - collapse sne ( smith et al .  2010c ; li et al .",
    "2010 ) , sn  2010jl appears to be a member of the class of unusually luminous examples of these ( smith et al .",
    "2007 , 2008 , 2010a ; prieto et al .  2007 ; drake et al .",
    "2010 ; rest et al .  2009 ) .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the pre - explosion archival images of the field of sn  2010jl obtained with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) .",
    "we have obtained ground - based post - explosion images of the sn that allow us to constrain its position .",
    "we find a blue source in the _ hst _ images that is coincident with the sn position to within 1@xmath3 of our astrometric solution , suggesting that the source is likely to be either a detection of the blue progenitor star itself , or the star cluster in which it resided ( or both ) .",
    "as discussed below , this progenitor candidate has important implications for sne  iin , as well as for the evolution and death of massive stars in general .",
    "there have been two previous detections of progenitors of sne  iin , and both were luminous stars that reinforce a suspected link between sne  iin and the class of massive unstable stars known a luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) .",
    "one case is sn  2005gl , which was a moderately luminous sn  iin that transitioned into a more normal sn  ii .",
    "pre - explosion images showed a source at the sn position that disappeared after the sn faded ( gal - yam & leonard 2009 ) .",
    "the high luminosity suggested that the progenitor was a massive lbv ( gal - yam & leonard 2009 ) .",
    "the other example of a claimed detection of a sn  iin progenitor  sn  1961v  has a more circuitous and complicated history . for decades",
    "sn  1961v was considered a prototype ( although the most extreme example ) of giant eruptions of lbvs , and an analog of the 19th century eruption of @xmath4  carinae ( goodrich et al .",
    "1989 ; filippenko et al .",
    "1995 ; van dyk et al .",
    "2002 ) . however , two recent studies ( smith et al .  2010b ; kochanek et al .  2010 )",
    "argue for different reasons that sn  1961v was probably a true core - collapse sn , or at least that it shares observed properties with sn generally considered to be core - collapse sne iin .",
    "both studies point out that the pre-1961 photometry of this source s variability may be both a detection of a very luminous quiescent star , as well as a precursor lbv - like giant eruption in the few years before core collapse .",
    "sn  1961v is , however , a complicated case and study of it continues .    this strong connection between sne  iin and lbvs based on their progenitor stars supports an existing link based on the physics of sn  iin explosions  namely , accounting for highly luminous sne  iin with a blast wave hitting a massive opaque shell ( e.g. , smith & mccray 2007 ; van marle et al .",
    "2009 ) requires strong eruptive mass loss in the years preceding core collapse , consistent with giant eruptions of lbvs ( smith et al .",
    "2007 , 2008 , 2010a ; gal - yam & leonard 2009 ) .",
    "there are additional reasons to suspect a connection between lbvs and sne  iin , and these are reviewed elsewhere ( smith 2008 ) .",
    "in this paper we present the third detection of a candidate progenitor of a sn  iin .",
    "this adds to a number of candidate detections of other sn progenitors , most of which are sne  ii - p ( summarized by smartt 2009 ) .",
    "recently , there have also been some claimed detections of sn  ii - l progenitors which suggest progenitor stars that were somewhat more massive than those of sne  ii - p ( elias - rosa et al .  2010a , 2010b ; see also leonard 2010 ) .",
    "if true , the more massive progenitors of sne  ii - l and iin would require substantial modification to current views of sn progenitors and massive - star evolution in general ( smith et al .",
    "the host galaxy of sn 2010jl had observations taken @xmath510 yr prior to discovery with the wide field planetary camera 2 ( _ hst_/wfpc2 ) , which we retrieved from the _ hst _ archive and analyzed .",
    "ugc  5189a was observed in the f300w and f814w filters on 2001 feb .",
    "14 as part of go-8645 , with exposure times of 1800  s and 200  s , respectively .    to pinpoint the precise location of the progenitor in the _ hst _ images",
    ", we obtained ground - based images of sn  2010jl for comparison using megacam on the 3.6-m canada france hawaii telesope ( cfht ) .",
    "these images yielded an image quality of 0@xmath66 with 0@xmath6187 pixels . to perform astrometric solutions between the",
    "ground - based and _ hst _ images , we adopted the technique detailed by li et al.(2007 ) using stars present in both images .",
    "geometrical transformation between a combined 600 s @xmath7-band image ( with multiple short 10  s exposures to ensure that sn 2010jl was not saturated ) taken with megacam on 2010 nov .  9.60 and the 2001 _ hst_/wfpc2 images yields a precision of 0.47 wfpc2 pixels ( 0@xmath6047 ) for the sn location in the wfpc2 images .",
    "( note that an independent astrometric solution by one of us [ s.d.v . ] finds a larger 1@xmath3 precision of 0@xmath609 . ) within the uncertainty of the sn position , an object is clearly detected in the f300w image , and marginally detected in the f814w images , with a position of @xmath8 , @xmath9 ( j2000.0 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : finder ] shows a @xmath10 region of the site of sn  2010jl in the f300w and f814w _",
    "hst_/wfpc2 images .",
    "a candidate progenitor source is detected within 1@xmath3 precision of the astrometric solution .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "photometry for the progenitor candidate as measured with hstphot ( dolphin 2000a , 2000b ) yields f300w = @xmath11 mag and f814w = @xmath12 mag .",
    "the candidate is surrounded by some faint extended emission and has a neighboring source within @xmath10@xmath64 , so we forced hstphot to recognize the position of the candidate in order to extract the photometry . due to the complicated background",
    ", we suspect that the uncertainties of the photometry from hstphot are significantly underestimated , especially for the f814w filter image .",
    "the candidate source itself has a full width at half - maximum intensity ( fwhm ) less than 0@xmath63 , corresponding to @xmath573 pc at the distance of ugc  5189a .",
    "we have also initiated a campaign to obtain intensive spectroscopy of sn  2010jl .",
    "these spectra will be analyzed in detail in a future paper , but here we briefly discuss the appearance of the early - time spectrum and the profile of h@xmath13 .",
    "figure  [ fig : spec ] shows two spectra of sn  2010jl obtained on 2010 nov .  5 with the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( oke et al .",
    "1995 ) on the 10  m keck-1 telescope , and on 2010 nov .  7 with the deep imaging multi - object spectrograph ( deimos ; faber et al .",
    "2003 ) mounted on the 10  m keck-2 telescope .",
    "all observations were obtained with the slit oriented at the parallactic angle ( filippenko 1982 ) .",
    "standard routines were used to extract and calibrate the spectra ( e.g. , foley et al . 2003 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : spec ] compares our spectra of sn 2010jl with the early - time ( day 32 ) spectrum of the very luminous sn  iin 2006tf from smith et al .",
    "although the spectra of sne  2010jl and 2006tf are not identical , the continuum shape , balmer - line strengths and profiles , and presence of weak he  i and other narrow lines are sufficient to claim that the spectrum of sn  2010jl is consistent with those of previously observed luminous sne  iin .",
    "( there is considerable variety in the spectra of sne  iin . for a comparison of several other examples , see smith et al .",
    "2010a , as well as filippenko 1997 . )",
    "the deimos spectrum , which has significantly higher resolution than the lris spectrum , shows a number of narrow emission and absorption components from the dense pre - shock circumstellar medium ( csm ) , which will be analyzed in more detail in a forthcoming paper ( the narrow h@xmath13 absorption component is discussed below ) . figure  [ fig : spec ] also illustrates a 7000  k blackbody for comparison , which is not a fit .",
    "the mismatch between the 7000  k blackbody and the observed continuum shape suggests that either multiple - temperature components are present , or that there is substantial additional local reddening ( and , hence , a higher implied continuum temperature ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : spech ] shows the high - resolution h@xmath13 profile of sn  2010jl observed on 2010 nov .  5 , 6 , and 7 , assuming a redshift @xmath14 of 0.011 .",
    "spectra on the first two nights were obtained using the blue channel spectrograph mounted on the multiple mirror telescope ( mmt ) , with 105  s exposures , the 1200 lines mm@xmath15 grating , and a 1@xmath60 slit width .",
    "the nov .",
    "7 spectrum was obtained with keck / deimos , using a resolution of 4400 and a 1@xmath60 slit .",
    "the resulting normalized spectra in figure  [ fig : spech ] are remarkably consistent on all three nights , despite different facilities , setups , and observing conditions .",
    "this offers reassurance that the double - peaked narrow profile is not a subtraction artifact that might arise from oversubtracting a nearby h  ii region along the slit , for example .",
    "the h@xmath13 profile has an intermediate - width component that can be approximated by a lorentzian profile with fwhm = 1800 km s@xmath15 ( the thick gray curve in figure  [ fig : spech ] ) , which may be common in sne  iin at early times because of high optical depths ( see smith et al .",
    "the wings of this lorentzian extend to more than @xmath164000 km s@xmath15 .",
    "this lorentzian profile is shifted by @xmath050 km s@xmath15 , and the high signal - to - noise ratio spectra show some minor deviations from perfect symmetry in the line wings .",
    "the narrow h@xmath13 component appears double peaked , and can be approximated by a symmetric gaussian emission component with fwhm = 120 km s@xmath15 ( solid gray curve ) , but with an absorption component at @xmath028 km s@xmath15 relative to the emission - component centroid .",
    "the @xmath028 km s@xmath15 absorption suggests that the pre - shock csm along our line of sight is rather slow , comparable to the wind speed of an extreme red supergiant ( rsg ) that might be a plausible progenitor of a sn  iin ( smith et al .",
    "however , the 120 km s@xmath15 emission component suggests that the ionized pre - shock wind in directions away from our line of sight is faster .",
    "these higher speeds in emission are faster than what one normally attributes to rsgs , perhaps supporting the possibility that the progenitor was in an lbv - like phase .",
    "alternatively , at such early times ( and relatively small radii in the csm ) , radiative acceleration of the pre - shock csm by the sn light may also play a role ( e.g. , chugai et al .",
    "2002 ) , although in this case it would be unclear why the 28 km s@xmath15 component along our line of sight is not accelerated as well .",
    "the faster speeds seen in emission may also indicate an asymmetric pre - shock csm ; we plan to investigate this asymmetry further in a later paper .",
    "we adopt a distance to ugc  5189a of @xmath17 mpc ( distance modulus @xmath18 mag ) and a galactic reddening value of @xmath19 mag ( @xmath20 mag , @xmath21 mag ) from schlegel et al .",
    "we do not assume any local host - galaxy reddening in our analysis below . with these parameters ,",
    "the apparent magnitudes imply a very luminous source with absolute magnitudes of about @xmath012.0 ( f300w ) and @xmath010.4 ( f814w ) .",
    "possible interpretations for this luminous blue source are discussed below .",
    "\\1 . _ the sn progenitor resided in a blue star cluster .",
    "_ if the blue source detected in the _ hst _ image is not dominated by emission from the progenitor star itself , it could be a luminous blue star cluster at the same position , of which the progenitor may have been a member .",
    "figure  [ fig : sed]a shows that the blue color of the source could be explained by a young star cluster with an age of 56 myr .",
    "if the progenitor candidate of sn  2010jl is actually a young blue star cluster , it is among the most massive young star clusters known . even in colliding",
    "starburst galaxies like the antennae , clusters with @xmath22 @xmath1 10 mag are extremely rare ( whitmore et al.2010 ) . as a more familiar example in a dwarf irregular galaxy ,",
    "the entire 30  doradus complex has an absolute visual magnitude of about @xmath011 , but this would be spread over @xmath51@xmath65 at the distance of ugc  5189a .",
    "the more compact star cluster r136 in the core of 30  dor has an absolute magnitude of only about @xmath09.3 mag , and would be spatially unresolved in the _ hst _ images of ugc  5189a .",
    "it is probable that any member of such a young star cluster reaching core collapse would be among the most massive stars in that cluster , and a cluster age of @xmath17 myr implies a stellar lifetime corresponding to initial masses of @xmath2330 m@xmath2 ( e.g. , schaller et al .",
    "1992 ) , if the cluster is roughly coeval to within about 1  myr .",
    "the sn progenitor was an extremely luminous lbv - like star in quiescence .",
    "_ if an absolute f814w magnitude of @xmath010.4 corresponds to an individual star , that star was extremely luminous and massive .",
    "the most massive main - sequence o - type stars do not have visual luminosities this high , because they are too hot and they emit most of their flux in the ultraviolet . to be this bright at red wavelengths ,",
    "a star would need to be evolved , shifting its bolometric flux to longer wavelengths .",
    "however , even the most massive yellow hypergiants and rsgs have bolometric luminosities fainter than about @xmath09.5 mag ( humphreys et al .  1979 ) , and",
    "these sources are redder than the progenitor candidate anyway , so these can not account for the detected source .",
    "the dereddened color is consistent with an apparent temperature of roughly 14,000  k ( figure  [ fig : sed]b ) .",
    "the only viable type of quiescent blue star would be an extremely luminous lbv - like star , but it would need a luminosity comparable to the most luminous known stars such as @xmath4  car , implying an initial mass above 80 m@xmath2 .",
    "the sn progenitor was normally fainter , but was caught in a precursor lbv - like eruption phase .",
    "_ one could relax the requirement that the progenitor of sn  2010jl was among the most massive stars known if the star was in an outburst state at the time it was observed by _",
    "an absolute f814w magnitude of @xmath010.4 with a blue color is within the range of observed values for lbv - like eruptions , either as a bright s  doradus eruption or a relatively modest example of a giant lbv eruption ( see smith et al .",
    "2010b for details ) . the blue color ,",
    "though , would be more consistent with the latter ( smith et al",
    ".  2010b ) .",
    "this explanation has the advantage that a precursor lbv - like eruption is needed anyway , in order to create the dense csm needed to explain the type  iin spectrum and high luminosity of the sn ( e.g. , smith et al .",
    "2008 ) . since these outbursts can , in some cases , last for @xmath510 yr ( see smith et al .",
    "2010b ) , it is not necessarily improbable to catch a progenitor star in this phase within the decade before core collapse .",
    "\\4 . _ a combination of the above .",
    "_ it is also possible that the detected flux from the progenitor candidate has contributions from both a host cluster and options 2 or 3 above .",
    "however , as shown in figure  [ fig : sed]b , if most of the red flux comes from a cool lbv with an apparent temperature around 7,500  k , for example , then this tightens the restrictions on the cluster age : the cluster must be bluer and therefore younger than for a cluster alone , implying an age of 3  myr or less . by the same line of reasoning discussed above",
    ", this younger age would imply an even more massive progenitor .",
    "hypothetically , there is a very small possibility that any of these three types of sources could be seen at the sn position due to a chance line - of - sight projection . for a @xmath24 pixel area around the sn location ( @xmath25 ) , 13 sources were detected in the f300w image at the 3@xmath3 level . for an error radius of 0.47 pixel , the chance coincidence is only 2.3% .",
    "a chance projection is therefore very unlikely , and moreover , this type of ambiguity plagues all studies of sn progenitors and sn host sites . to confirm that our candidate source detected in archival data was in fact the direct detection of",
    "a luminous progenitor star will require additional observations after the sn has faded , to see if it has significantly changed  but for a luminous sn  iin that may continue to interact with dense csm , we may need to wait several years . even before that time",
    ", however , one significant point is clearly evident : _ all three plausible scenarios require the progenitor of sn  2010jl to have been a very massive star _ , with an initial mass higher than those typically derived for sne  ii - p ( smartt 2009 ; leonard 2010 ) .",
    "this has significant implications for stellar evolution , discussed next .",
    "whether the progenitor candidate is a young star cluster or a direct detection of the progenitor star itself , the luminous blue source implies that the progenitor had an initial mass above 30 m@xmath2 .",
    "sn progenitors below this range , as seen for sne ii - p ( smartt 2009 ) , are not found to reside in very luminous , compact , young star clusters .",
    "an individual star with a quiescent luminosity of the candidate progenitor would have an initial mass @xmath2680 m@xmath2 , and a star caught in an lbv outburst would most likely be a star with an initial mass above 30 m@xmath2 as well ( see smith et al .",
    "2010b ) .",
    "\\(1 ) sne  iin arise preferentially from very massive stellar progenitors . as noted in   1 , this is based on the direct detections of lbv - like progenitors of sn  2005gl and sn  1961v , as well as on the large amounts of mass in the csm needed to explain luminous sne  iin .",
    "if the sn  2010jl progenitor candidate is a luminous individual star resembling an lbv , it further strengthens the connection between lbvs and sne  iin .",
    "\\(2 ) since sn  2010jl is a sn  iin , requiring that the progenitor ejected h - rich material shortly before core collapse , its massive progenitor reinforces the conclusion that very massive stars sometimes retain h envelopes until shortly before core collapse , instead of shedding all of their h envelopes at nearly solar metallicity to produce sne  ibc ( e.g. , heger et al .",
    "a viable alternative , which is consistent with the observed fractions of various sn subtypes , is that many sne  ibc result instead from close binary evolution across a wide range of progenitor mass , and that the most massive single stars produce sne  iin ( smith et al .",
    "2010c ; yoon , woosley , & langer 2010 ) .",
    "\\(3 ) lastly , if the sn  2010jl progenitor was a massive star , it provides another example suggesting that very massive stars can produce luminous explosions , instead of collapsing quietly to a black hole ( see oconnor & ott 2010 ; smith et al .",
    "2010c ) .",
    "standard stellar evolution models fail to account for all three of these basic observational indications .",
    "instead , models generally infer that single massive stars at roughly solar metallicity with initial masses above 30 m@xmath2 either will shed their h enveloeps to make sne  ibc , or will fail to make successful visible explosions and collapse directly to black holes ( e.g. , heger et al .",
