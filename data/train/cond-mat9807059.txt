    "the standard treatment of fermionic and bosonic systems in canonical ensemble using path integral formalism is based on the isomorphism between a system of interacting quantum particles and a set of interacting classical polymer rings @xcite . for a system of bosons",
    "all the ring contributions to the density matrix come with the same sign thus allowing an effective monte - carlo sampling of the relevant terms @xcite .",
    "however , for the case of fermions situation is more complicated as different ring contributions to the density matrix come with alternating signs thus making statistical fluctuations so big that an unreasonably long averages are required to provide for the meaningful results . while several promising attempts were made to circumvent the sign problem @xcite there is still much to be done before this problem will be solved .",
    "however , instead of operating in a canonical ensemble for fermionic and bosonic systems it might be more advantageous to work in the grand canonical ensemble . to see why ,",
    "as soon as one knows the normal excitations @xmath0 of the system the grand canonical partition function is then@xmath1 where @xmath2 .",
    "the density matrix can then be expressed as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the hamiltonian . by reformulating the problem in this fashion , one need not worry about the explicit antisymmetrization or symmetrization of @xmath5 and @xmath6 states .",
    "the problem of finding @xmath7 and @xmath8 is re - expressed in terms of the normal excitations of a system .",
    "thus if in the canonical formulation we had @xmath9 interacting fermionic or bosonic particles with a density matrix @xmath10 and a properly symmetrized wave function , in the grand canonical formulation we can in principle reduce the problem to a system of non interacting particles described by the density matrix @xmath11 .",
    "this appears much simpler than the problem in a canonical formulation but there is one problem .",
    "the question is how to find a spectrum of normal excitations . for fermionic systems",
    "the problem is solved in principle in the kohn sham ( ks ) density functional formalism @xcite . according to ( ks ) the problem of @xmath9",
    "interacting fermions with a hamiltonian @xmath12 can be mapped into a problem of @xmath9 noninteracting particles described by a modified hamiltonian @xmath4 which is , in turn , the functional of the density ( see the review @xcite ) @xmath13 where @xmath14 is an electron - ion interaction potential , @xmath15 is the hartree potential of the electrons and finally , @xmath16 is a universal exchange correlation electron density functional .",
    "thus , a self - consistent algorithm for finding the density matrix in the grand canonical formulation would be implemented as following + a ) use @xmath17 to find a new effective hamiltonian @xmath4 + b ) given @xmath4 calculate a new @xmath17 from @xmath18 + c ) update the chemical potential @xmath19 ( which comes via @xmath20 ) + d ) if self - consistency is not achieved go to a )    up to this point the algorithm is rather general and can be implemented in many ways .",
    "one of the implementations of this algorithm for fermions is originally due to s. goedecker @xcite and lately extended by baer @xcite .",
    "the most important step is to implement part b ) . so that @xmath21 where @xmath22 is any convenient basis set . by approximating @xmath23 using chebyshev polynomials goedecker et .",
    "al obtained an efficient way of calculating the density matrix using @xmath24 as a propagator .",
    "an alternative and potentially more beneficial method for implementation of step b ) is to use the path integral approach @xcite . in the path integral",
    "formalism to evaluate the density matrix one would insert @xmath25 auxiliary states thus reducing the problem to the evaluation of @xmath26 . at high temperature @xmath27",
    "so the conventional use of the trotter approximation for the splitting of the hamiltonian into kinetic and potential energy is applicable . at low temperatures @xmath28 in the case of fermion statistics @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a step function and the propagator becomes invariant with respect to @xmath25 .",
    "so the major difference between using the grand canonical approach in the path integral formulation is the approximation of the intermediate propagator . as a function of @xmath25 ,",
    "propagator @xmath31 is very easy to estimate at high temperature by factoring out the kinetic and potential term . at low temperatures",
    "the propagator becomes @xmath25-independent thus substantially hindering its use in calculations and thus new methods need to be implemented for the evaluation of this propagator . in this work we present a tractable solution valid at all temperatures .",
    "the problem of evaluation of the fermionic density matrix at zero temperature allows an exact solution in the path integral formulation in terms of bessel functions @xcite . for the case of non - zero temperatures",
    "the problem has also been solved with the fermionic density matrix represented in integral form @xcite .    here",
    "we will show that there exists a more computationally convenient representation for the fermionic and bosonic density matrix in terms of the hankel functions of the first kind .    to calculate the density matrix in the grand canonical ensemble we will exploit the property of a meromorphic function been equal to a summation over its poles and residues at those poles .",
    "@xmath32 where @xmath33 for fermions and @xmath34 for bosons .",
    "the density matrix now can be written as @xmath35    in this form it is still difficult to make a transition to a path integral formalism .",
    "we notice , however , that for @xmath36 @xmath37 and for @xmath38 @xmath39 thus , evaluation of @xmath40 is now substantially simplified and we can change to a path integral formulation . @xmath41 element @xmath42 is nothing else but a real time propagator .",
    "its evaluation in a path integral formalism is trivial and leads to @xmath43 where @xmath44 @xmath45 finally , for @xmath36 @xmath46 and for @xmath38 @xmath47    using the integral representation of the hankel s functions @xcite @xmath48 and summing over all frequencies , it is easy to show that the expression for the density matrix can be then rewritten as following , @xmath49 for fermions @xmath50 for bosons , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 @xmath53 in the case of bosons , a term in the summation corresponding to zero frequency @xmath54 should be calculated in a limit @xmath55 .",
    "it is also of interest to show how an integral representation of the universal functional appears in this formalism .",
    "we will outline the major steps on the example of fermions .",
    "we notice , that for @xmath36 equations ( [ eq1],[eq2 ] ) can be written as @xmath56 and for @xmath38 @xmath57 correspondent propagators are for @xmath36 @xmath58 and for @xmath38 @xmath59    now summation over frequencies can be implemented.for the case of fermions @xmath60    @xmath61    making an explicit summation over frequencies and substituting the above equations into ( [ eq0 ] ) we get @xmath62 where @xmath63 it is straightforward to check that in the limit of @xmath64 the above expression coincides with that of ref.@xcite .",
    "above we showed that the density matrix for fermions and bosons can be expressed via a universal functional @xmath65 as @xmath66 from the explicit form of the universal functional derived above one can easily derive a scaling law @xmath67    this scaling law can be useful if we consider that the integral over the universal functional can be rewritten as @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 is the distribution of pairs of variables @xmath71 .",
    "so , in principle , it is enough to calculate the universal functional once for say @xmath72 and the value of the functional at all other temperatures can be evaluated using the scaling law .",
    "the integration process can be implemented by first calculating the distribution @xmath70 ( which actually depends upon @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) and then multiplying this distribution on the values of the universal functional calculated on a 2d grid shifted by @xmath75 along the @xmath76 axis .",
    "the averages and thermodynamical derivatives of the generic operator @xmath77 can now be determined from @xmath78 and derivatives from @xmath79 @xmath80 where the thermodynamic derivatives of the density matrix can be calculated using the scaling relation for the universal functional giving @xmath81 and @xmath82",
    "to investigate the possible usefulness of this method we have performed a study of a simple model system consisting of noninteracting fermions in a confining potential of the form @xmath83 here we assume to work in units @xmath84 .",
    "this potential allows 5 discrete levels and analytical solution for the @xmath85 functions .",
    "the calculations of the density profiles were implemented as follows .",
    "first , a universal functional was generated for @xmath72 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "one can see a strong oscillatory nature of the potential signifying the fermionic nature of the system under consideration .",
    "next step was to generate the distribution of @xmath70 which is actually the most time consuming part of the calculations .",
    "so , to find @xmath88 for each value of @xmath89 a proper @xmath70 distribution was generated using monte - carlo sampling .",
    "the final step of our calculations was in computing the product of the universal potential and the @xmath70 distribution . by increasing the chemical potential one",
    "moves the @xmath70 distribution profile to the right thus coupling to more and more oscillations of the universal functional henceforth introducing more particles in a system .",
    "thus calculated density profiles for different values of the chemical potential are plotted on fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . for the sake of comparison density profiles obtained from the exact solution of schroedinger equation",
    "are also plotted on fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . comparing two figures",
    "one can notice that even for such a small number of subdivisions @xmath87 the overall structure of the density profiles is the same in both cases .",
    "grand canonical formulation of path integral formalism allows an exact treatment of fermionic and bosonic systems at any temperature without encountering a complicated problem of antisymmetrization or symmetrization of coordinate eigen states . in this formulation density matrix",
    "is expressed as an integral over the universal functional @xmath90 while particular properties of a system come through the variables @xmath91 .",
    "computationally convenient representation of the universal functional is possible in terms of hankel functions of the first kind so one can , in principle , precalculate the @xmath90 and the density itself will be determined by a distribution of the non - universal variables @xmath91 .",
