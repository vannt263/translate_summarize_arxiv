    "accreting binary pulsars are an ideal laboratory for studying the fundamental physics of radiative transfer of x - ray photons under strong ( of the order of 10@xmath8 g ) magnetic fields .",
    "a quite evident manifestation of such transfers are cyclotron resonance scattering features ( crsfs ) observed in the spectra of many x - ray sources  the first being observed in her x-1 @xcite .",
    "crsfs are caused by resonant scatterings between the landau levels of electrons under the strong magnetic field near the surface of neutron star .",
    "the cyclotron resonance energy , @xmath9 , is strongly related to the magnetic field strength : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the magnetic field strength in units of @xmath12 g , and @xmath13 represents the gravitational red - shift at the resonance point . to date , crsfs have been detected from 16 accreting binary pulsars and measured their magnetic field strength @xcite .",
    "however , the formation mechanism of crsfs is not still fully understood due to the complex physics of resonant scattering and their continuum .",
    "thus , the comparison of the crsfs parameters observed in different sources , at different luminosity and spectral states is important to gain information on the physical processes taking place .",
    "the japanese x - ray satellite _ suzaku _ , with its high sensitivity hard x - ray detector ( hxd ; * ? ? ? * ) , has discovered crsfs from gx 304 - 1 @xcite , successfully detected crsfs from a0535 + 262 @xcite in its lowest luminosity epochs , and performed detailed studies of the crsfs of her x-1 @xcite , 4u 1907 + 09 @xcite and 1a 1118@xmath061 @xcite .",
    "4u 1626@xmath067 was observed by _ suzaku _ on 2006 march .",
    "the source is a 7.7  s pulsar in a low - mass x - ray binary system with an orbital period of 42 min @xcite .",
    "the x - ray spectrum shows low - energy emission lines from ne and o @xcite and a feature at @xmath14 kev @xcite .",
    "the 37 kev absorption feature was discovered by _",
    "bepposax _ and interpreted as the fundamental crsf .",
    "the 1060 kev source flux is @xmath15 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 and the resonance energy corresponds to a magnetic field strength of @xmath16 g @xcite .",
    "the broadband x - ray continuum exhibits a strong phase dependence as reported by _",
    "@xcite , _ tenma _ @xcite and _ rxte _ @xcite .",
    "the cyclotron feature and the phase dependence variability provide information on radiative transfer in the plasma of the accretion column . in this paper",

    "the paper is organized as follows : we describe the observations from _ suzaku _ and the data reduction procedure in  2 , show the results of the timing and spectral analyses in  3 , and finally provide a discussion and summary in  4 .",

    "one instrument is an x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a charge - coupled device camera at the focus of the x - ray telescope ( xrt ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , covering the 0.212 kev energy range .",
    "there are four xis units ; three of them ( xis-0 , xis-2 and xis-3 ) are front - illuminated ( fi ) while the other one ( xis-1 ) is back - illuminated ( bi ) .",
    "the other instrument is a hard x - ray detector ( hxd ; * ? ? ?",

    "xis spectra and light curves were extracted from a circle with a radius of 4.3 arcmin centered at the source .",

    ", we stress that the continuum requires a hard component with a large cutoff energy , in addition to a wide and deep absorption feature , as seen in figure 12 .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath32 value at the dim phase matches those at the other phases with the emission model , whereas a large jump in the value is required with the absorption model , as shown in figure 9 .",
    "we observed the 4u 1626@xmath067 pulsar with the _ suzaku _ satellite in march 2006 . the pulse period determined by the hxd - pin of _ suzaku _",
    "is @xmath25 = @xmath302 s , and this value agrees with that reported by @xcite . in the pulse phase - averaged spectra ,",
    "the fundamental crsf is clearly detected at @xmath75 kev ( gabs model ) and the continuum emission is better reproduced by the npex model than the ecut model .",
    "phase - resolved spectral analyses consistently show strong phase dependence , both in the continuum emission and in the crsf , particularly in the dim phase .",
    "quantitatively , the positive component of the npex model vanishes near the dim phase , and the crsf in the dim phase is reproduced by using a gaussian shaped emission line model .",
    "the statistical significance of the emission line using the @xcite f - test routine is @xmath6 and @xmath303 taking account into the systematic errors in the background evaluation of hxd - pin .",
    "the results means that even if the the real nxb level of hxd - pin is 3% higher , which is the worst case of underestimating nxb level , the significance level is still around 3@xmath27 level .",
    "thus , we have possibly detected the emission line at the cyclotron resonance energy in the dim phase .",
    "what is the origin of the emission feature in the dim phase ?",
    "@xcite pointed out that if the photons originate from an optically thick accretion column ( with a thomson optical depth @xmath304 ) without temperature and density gradients , the crsf is expected to be an absorption feature with comptonized spectra .",
    "in contrast , if the photons originate from an optically thin accretion column ( @xmath305 ) , the crsf is expected to be an emission feature with a free - free continuum . to compare this theoretical model with the _ suzaku _ spectra , the unfolded spectra in the on - phase ( @xmath3060.750 ) and the dim phase ( @xmath1080.250 ) are shown in figure 13 .",
    "qualitatively , our observed results are consistent with the theoretical predictions ; the wien hump disappears with the appearance of an emission - like feature .",
    "this resemblance suggests that we observed the cyclotron resonance scattering emission feature caused by collisional excitation of a landau level , followed by radiative deexcitation .",
    "the deciding factor as to whether we observe absorption spectra or emission spectra is thus the optical depth of the accretion column , and for the case of 4u 1626@xmath067 , since change occurs according to the spin phase , changes in optical depth arise from changes in viewing angle .      here , @xmath309 is the electron number density , @xmath27 is the scattering cross section and @xmath310 is the plasma length - scale through which a photon passes . in a strong magnetic field ,",
    "where the strength of the field is greater than the thermal energy , the scattering cross section depends on the direction of photons relative to the magnetic field vector . according to @xcite , the scattering cross section of photons averaged over the energy and the ( ordinary and extraordinary ) modes is described by @xmath311 when the photons have energies far less than @xmath9 , and they propagate parallel to the magnetic field . here",
    ", @xmath312 is the thomson scattering cross section and @xmath313 is the mean photon energy .",
    "thus , the optical depth propagating parallel to the magnetic field , @xmath314 , is @xmath315 in contrast , the averaged cross section for photons propagating perpendicular to the magnetic field , @xmath316 , can be approximated by @xmath317 and the optical depth propagating perpendicular to the magnetic field , @xmath318 , is @xmath319 therefore , from equations ( 7 ) and ( 9 ) we see that the optical depth is anisotropic , and the probability of comptonization of photons depends on the direction that the photons are propagating through the plasma .",
    "this anisotropy of optical depth in the comptonization process is expected to cause the phase dependence of the wien hump .    to verify the phase dependence of the wien hump",
    ", we again fit the phase - resolved spectra by the npex model , except for the dim phase , where the @xmath32 value are instead fixed at the phase - averaged value ( table 1 ) by assuming thermal equilibrium . here",
    ", the crsf is described by the gabs model and the spectral fits are found to be acceptable .",
    "figure 14 shows the background - subtracted pulse profile for the 1030 kev energy band and compares this with values of @xmath320 plotted as a function of the pulse phase .",
    "these two plots clearly agree .",
    "in other words , x - ray fluxes in the 1030 kev range are represented by only the wien hump . since ,",
    "as described above , radiation is caused by the optical depth of scattering , the dim phase corresponds to the optically thin phase .",
    "therefore , this result is explained correctly by our prediction .    to estimate the value of @xmath314",
    "qualitatively , we use the simple assumptions that the plasma is at thermal equilibrium and that the accretion column is homogeneous . under these conditions",
    ", @xmath313 is equal to the electron temperature .",
    "therefore , the ratio between @xmath314 and @xmath318 is estimated by using the observed @xmath321 kev and the @xmath322 kev derived from fitting the phase - averaged spectra by the npex with gabs model ( table 1 ) : @xmath323 thus , if the difference between @xmath324 and @xmath325 is small ( @xmath326 ) , the optical depth for the dim phase spectra is approximately one or two orders of magnitude lower than that in the bright phase .",
    "if we assume that the thomson optical depth of the bright phase is around 10 , the cyclotron resonance scattering absorption feature can be seen as an emission feature at a certain viewing angle .",
    "the authors appreciate very much the many constructive comments from the anonymous referee .",
    "we thank all of the _ suzaku _ team members for their dedicated support in the satellite operation and calibration .",
