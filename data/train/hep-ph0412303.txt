    "open charm measurements date back to the late 1970s when @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons were first detected , completing the picture of the fourth quark begun when the @xmath0 was detected in @xmath4be and @xmath5 interactions .",
    "the charm quark was postulated to have a mass between 1.2 and 1.8 gev , within the regime of perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) .",
    "because of its relatively large mass , it is possible to calculate a total @xmath6 cross section , not the case for lighter flavors such as strangeness .",
    "charm hadrons are usually detected two ways .",
    "the reconstruction of decays to charged hadrons such as @xmath7 ( 3.8% ) and @xmath8 ( 9.1% ) gives the full momentum of the initial @xmath2 meson , yielding the best direct measurement .",
    "charm can also be detected indirectly via semi - leptonic decays to leptons such as @xmath9 although the momentum of the parent @xmath2 meson remains unknown .",
    "early measurements of prompt leptons in beam dump experiments assumed that the density of the dump was high enough to absorb semi - leptonic decays of non - charm hadrons , leaving only the charm component . at modern colliders , it is not possible to use beam dumps to measure charm from leptons but , at sufficiently high @xmath10 , electrons from charm emerge from hadronic cocktails @xcite .",
    "although @xmath2 mesons are usually used to determine the total @xmath6 cross section , other charm hadrons also exist .",
    "the excited @xmath2 states , @xmath11s , decay primarily to charged and neutral @xmath2 mesons .",
    "the charm - strange meson , the @xmath12 , decays to charged hadrons and simultaneously to leptons .",
    "the lowest lying charm baryon is the @xmath13 which decays primarily to @xmath14 but also decays to @xmath15 and to the lepton channel .",
    "the heavier ground state charm baryons and their excited states ( @xmath16 and higher ) decay through the @xmath17 channel .",
    "the charm - strange baryons are assumed to be a negligible contribution to the total cross section .",
    "a selection of charm hadrons , their masses , decay lengths and branching ratios to leptons and charged hadrons are given in table  [ chadtable ] .",
    ".ground state charm hadrons with their masses , decay lengths ( when given ) and branching ratios to leptons ( when applicable ) and some prominent charged hadron decays . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     extracting the total charm cross section is a non - trivial task . to go from a finite number of measured @xmath2 mesons in a particular decay channel to the total @xmath6 cross section one must : divide by the branching ratio ; correct for the luminosity , @xmath18 ; extrapolate to full phase space from the finite detector acceptance ; divide by two to get the pair cross section from the single @xmath2s ; and multiply by a correction factor @xcite to account for the unmeasured charm hadrons .",
    "there are assumptions all along the way .",
    "the most important is the extrapolation to full phase space . before",
    "qcd calculations were available , the data were extrapolated assuming a power law for the @xmath19 distribution , related to the longitudinal momentum of the charm hadron by @xmath20 .",
    "the canonical parameterization is @xmath21 where @xmath22 was either fit to data over a finite @xmath19 range or simply assumed .",
    "these parameterizations could lead to large overestimates of the total cross section when @xmath23 was assumed , especially when data were taken only near @xmath24 .",
    "lepton measurements were more conservative but were typically at more forward @xmath19 .",
    "there has been a great deal of improvement over the last 10 - 15 years .",
    "next - to - leading order ( nlo ) calculations are used in the phase space extrapolation , resulting in considerably less ambiguity in the shape of the @xmath19 distributions , @xmath25 .",
    "the transverse momentum distributions are more difficult , as we will discuss later . to calculate the total cross section to nlo , scaling functions @xcite proportional to logs of @xmath26 are useful where @xmath27 is the scale of the hard process .",
    "the hadronic cross section in @xmath1 collisions can be written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the fractional momenta carried by the colliding partons and @xmath31 are the proton parton densities .",
    "the partonic cross sections are @xmath32   + { \\cal o}(\\alpha_s^2 ) \\right\\ } \\,\\ , .",

    "it is most consistent to assume that the factorization scale , @xmath36 , and the renormalization scale , @xmath37 , are equal , @xmath38 .",
    "there is no dependence on the kinematic variables .",
    "some nnlo calculations are available near threshold , @xmath39 , applicable only for @xmath40 gev @xcite .",
    "the nlo corrections to the leading order ( lo ) cross sections are relatively large , @xmath41 , depending on @xmath27 , @xmath42 and the parton densities @xcite .",
    "the nnlo corrections are about as large to next - to - next - to - leading logarithm @xcite but decrease to less than @xmath43 when subleading logs are included @xcite .",
    "this @xmath44 factor is large because , in the range @xmath45 gev , @xmath46 with a 5-flavor qcd scale , @xmath47 , of @xmath48 gev for the grv98 ho and @xmath49 gev for the mrst parton densities , @xmath50 , nearly a factor of two variation .",
    "( the larger value corresponds to the smallest @xmath42 and @xmath27 values with the larger @xmath47 . )",
    "the situation improves for bottom where @xmath51 is smaller , @xmath52 , and is quite good for top , @xmath53 . instead of presenting a wide range of possible cross sections and emphasizing the uncertainties , the approach taken in ref .",
    "@xcite has been to `` fit '' @xmath42 and @xmath27 for a particular parton density and extrapolate to higher energies .",
    "the results are compared to some of the total cross section data @xcite on the left - hand side of fig .",
    "[ totpluspt ] .",
    "the data tend to favor lower values of @xmath42 , @xmath54 gev .",
    "the two curves cross each other because the mrst calculation with @xmath55 increases faster at large @xmath56 and smaller @xmath57 due to the stronger qcd evolution of the parton densities at the higher scale .",
    "although the fixed target results are in good agreement with the calculations , the phenix point @xcite at 130 gev , from au+au electron measurements , and the star point @xcite , from a combination of electron and reconstructed @xmath2 measurements , are generally above the calculations .",
    "the star point is about a factor of four over the calculated cross section .",
    "the higher energy @xmath58 data from ua1 @xcite and cdf @xcite are in better agreement with the calculations .",
    "( at these energies , the @xmath1 and @xmath58 cross sections differ by less than 1% for @xmath59 gev . )",
    "now we turn to the transverse momentum , @xmath10 , distributions . in this case , the quark mass is no longer the only scale and @xmath10-dependent logs also appear .",
    "thus , to interpolate between the high @xmath10 scale of @xmath10 and the low @xmath10 scale of @xmath42 , a scale proportional to @xmath60 , the transverse mass , is the natural choice . the charm quark @xmath10 distributions are not strongly dependent on quark mass for @xmath61 gev , as may be expected , where the difference in rate is @xmath62% between @xmath63 and 1.8 gev .",
    "the difference in the total cross sections is almost all at @xmath64 gev . changing the scale changes the slope of the @xmath10 distributions .",
    "the distributions are harder for @xmath65 than @xmath55 .",
    "the average @xmath10 , @xmath66 , increases with @xmath42 and is larger for @xmath65 .",
    "more modeling is involved for @xmath2 mesons in the treatment of fragmentation / hadronization and momentum broadening .",
    "if factorization holds in the final state ( universal fragmentation functions ) as well as in the initial state ( universal parton distributions ) then the fragmentation functions extracted in @xmath5 should also be applicable to @xmath1 and d@xmath67 .",
    "however , this assumption does not work well for charm .",
    "the peterson function , generally used in hadroproduction codes , reduces the charm hadron momentum by 30% relative to the charm quark . as shown in huang s",
    "talk @xcite , the peterson function agrees reasonably well with the @xmath68 data .",
    "( however , it does not include any scale evolution . in low @xmath56 collisions ,",
    "the momentum reduction due to fragmentation can be compensated by intrinsic transverse momentum , @xmath69 , broadening .",
    "however , such broadening can not compensate the @xmath19 distributions , only marginally affected by @xmath69 smearing .",
    "we have previously shown that the @xmath2 meson @xmath19 distributions are consistent with no momentum loss during charm quark hadronization @xcite . )",
    "the exclusive nlo @xmath70 code of ref .",
    "@xcite includes fragmentation and broadening .",
    "this program adds the @xmath69 kick in the final , rather than the initial state .",
    "the initial @xmath69 of the partons could have alternatively been given to the entire final - state system , as is essentially done if applied in the initial state , instead of to the @xmath70 pair .",
    "the gaussian function @xmath71 , @xmath72 multiplies the parton distribution functions , assuming the @xmath57 and @xmath69 dependencies completely factorize .",
    "if true , it does not matter whether the @xmath69 dependence appears in the initial or final state .",
    "there is no difference if the calculation is lo but at nlo an additional light parton appears in the final state .",
    "the difference in the two methods is rather small if @xmath73 gev@xmath74 @xcite .",
    "the value @xmath75 gev@xmath74 was used in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the effects of fragmentation and intrinsic @xmath69 broadening of @xmath76 gev@xmath74 compensate each other at @xmath77 gev to give a @xmath2 meson @xmath10 distribution very similar to that of the charm quark @xcite .",
    "however , at rhic energies , the situation is quite different . due to the higher @xmath66 at larger @xmath56 ,",
    "the effect of broadening is relatively small and can not compensate for the momentum loss induced by fragmentation .",
    "interestingly enough , the star @xmath2 and @xmath11 @xmath10 distribution agrees rather well with the calculated nlo charm quark distribution , as shown in van leeuwen s talk @xcite .",
    "on the right - hand side of fig .",
    "[ totpluspt ] , we show the corresponding @xmath10 distributions at @xmath78 gev for the two sets of parameters in the total cross section curves on the left - hand side .",
    "the differences in the slopes are due to the different scales while the normalization difference is due to the choice of charm mass and the parton densities  the mrst densities generally give a larger cross section due to their larger @xmath51 .",
    "however , the curves need to be scaled up by a factor of four to agree with the star normalization @xcite , as may be expected from the total cross section results .",
    "the shape of the charm quark @xmath10 distribution at @xmath79 tev also agrees quite well with the cdf data from the tevatron @xcite .",
    "given the large discrepancy between the pqcd result and the star cross section , it might be surprising that the normalization is also in good agreement with the sum of the charged and neutral @xmath2 data scaled to include @xmath12 and @xmath17 production .",
    "no total cross section is available because only charm hadrons with @xmath80 gev have been measured so far .",
    "other model calculations of charm production at collider energies are available .",
    "the fonll calculation @xcite resums logs at @xmath81 , resulting in a harder charm quark distribution and uses a correspondingly harder fragmentation function to get agreement with the cdf data .",
    "it underestimates the low @xmath10 star data , resulting in an even lower total cross section than nlo pqcd @xcite .",
    "a calculation with unintegrated gluon distributions and @xmath69-dependent matrix elements , assuming saturation behavior at low @xmath57 , has also been made @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath57 values of the star data are not really very low . at rhic , from kinematics",
    "@xmath82 at @xmath83 and @xmath84 , the highest rapidity measured by star by kinematics alone . in reality",
    ", the actual @xmath85 may be higher when weighted by the parton densities . at higher @xmath10 ,",
    "@xmath57 is larger still , suggesting that the applicability of small @xmath57 physics for charm at rhic is rather dubious .",
    "finally , we would like to discuss reasons why fragmentation does not seem to factorize for charm , as expected .",
    "factorization breaking has been suggested from studies of the @xmath19 distributions of _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath86 and @xmath87 production , particularly in @xmath88 interactions where the @xmath87 is leading relative to the @xmath86 since the @xmath87 shares a valence quark with the @xmath89 while the @xmath86 does not .",
    "several mechanisms such as intrinsic charm @xcite and string drag have been proposed , both of which involve charm quark coalescence with spectators .",
    "such comoving partons are naturally produced in a hard scattering .",
    "although it is not intuitive to expect coalescence to work at high @xmath10 , it seems to do so for charm .",
    "we now turn to @xmath0 production in d+au interactions at rhic . previously , we calculated the effect of shadowing alone on the @xmath0 d@xmath67/@xmath1 ratio as a function of rapidity and impact parameter @xcite .",
    "the large @xmath6 total cross section also has implications for the @xmath0 yield if @xmath0 s arise from @xmath6 recombination in a qgp .",
    "such a total cross section would suggest significant secondary @xmath0 production at rhic , leading to enhancement rather than suppression in central collisions .",
    "there is no evidence for a strong regeneration effect in the phenix au+au data so far , see thews talk @xcite .",
    "shadowing , the modification of the parton densities in the nucleus with respect to the free nucleon , is parameterized as @xmath90 in eq .",
    "( [ sigpp ] ) .",
    "we did not discuss the effect of shadowing on the charm @xmath10 distributions because the effect at midrapidity is small and , on the logarithmic scale of the @xmath10 distributions , negligible .",
    "the @xmath0 is another story due to the phenix muon capability at forward and backward rapidity .",
    "as shown in pereira s talk @xcite , although the phenix @xmath0 data are consistent with shadowing alone , the data are also consistent with nuclear shadowing plus a small absorption cross section of @xmath91 mb , smaller than that currently obtained in sps measurements @xcite .",
    "we have calculated @xmath0 production in the color evaporation model ( cem ) using the same mass and scale as in @xmath92 production but cutting off the invariant mass of the pair at @xmath93 .",
    "the calculations of the d@xmath67/@xmath1 ratios are done at lo to simplify the calculations . as shown in fig .",
    "[ psiratnlo ] , the lo and nlo ratios are equivalent .",
    "we have now also implemented nucleon absorption in the calculation , showing the effect of several absorption and production mechanisms .    to implement nuclear absorption on @xmath0 production in @xmath94 collisions ,",
    "the @xmath95 production cross section is weighted by the survival probability , @xmath96 , so that @xcite @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the impact parameter and @xmath99 is the longitudinal production point . if @xmath100 , @xmath101 . for @xmath102 , @xmath103 .",
    "we define @xmath96 as @xmath104 the nucleon absorption cross section , @xmath105 , depends on where the state is produced and how far it travels through nuclear matter .",
    "the effective @xmath67 dependence is obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ sigfull ] ) and ( [ nsurv ] ) by integrating over @xmath106 , @xmath99 , and @xmath98 .",
    "the contribution to the full @xmath67 dependence in @xmath107 from absorption alone is only constant if @xmath105 is constant and independent of the production mechanism @xcite .",
    "the observed @xmath0 yield includes feed down from @xmath108 and @xmath109 decays , giving @xmath110 in color singlet production , the final state absorption cross section depends on the size of the @xmath6 pair as it traverses the nucleus , allowing absorption to be effective only while the cross section is growing toward its asymptotic size inside the target . on the other hand ,",
    "if the @xmath6 is only produced as a color octet , hadronization will occur only after the pair has traversed the target except at very backward rapidity .",
    "we have considered a constant octet cross section , as well as one that reverts to a color singlet at backward rapidities . for singlets , @xmath111 but , with octets",
    ", one assumes that @xmath112 . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ abs ] , the difference between the constant and growing octet assumptions is quite small at large @xmath56 with only a small singlet effect at @xmath113 and @xmath114 at rhic and the lhc respectively .",
    "singlet absorption is also important only at similar rapidities and is otherwise not different from shadowing alone .",
    "finally , we have also considered a combination of octet and singlet absorption in the context of the nrqcd model , see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details .",
    "the combination of nonperturbative singlet and octet parameters changes the shape of the shadowing ratio slightly .",
    "the results are shown integrated over impact parameter for the eks98 shadowing parameterization since it gives good agreement with the trend of the phenix data .",
    "we will not discuss the spatial dependence of shadowing and absorption in any detail here .",
    "the spatial dependence of shadowing alone was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . when absorption is included , the trend of the impact parameter dependence is in agreement with the phenix data at @xmath115 ( the north muon arm ) but is too weak to describe the strong dependence at @xmath116 ( the south muon arm ) , see pereira s talk @xcite .",
    "in summary , the rhic d+au data on open charm and @xmath0 are beginning to come into their own . while the qcd calculations agree well with the shape of the star @xmath10 distributions , they underestimate the reported total cross section . in contrast , the @xmath0 cross section is in relatively good agreement with qcd predictions @xcite and the agreement of the minimum bias data with calculations including shadowing and nucleon absorption is quite good .",
    "work is ongoing to better understand the impact parameter dependence ."
