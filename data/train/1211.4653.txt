    "a new state of matter , the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) , has been expected since the 1970s of last century  @xcite .",
    "its experimental production in heavy ion collisions is later well established by the evidences at rhic  @xcite .",
    "many discussions have been focused on the question whether this plasma is weakly or strongly coupled  @xcite .",
    "the hard thermal loop effective theory ( htl ) is based on a physical picture of the qgp as a gas of weakly coupled quasi - particles  quarks or gluons with temperature dependent effective masses and couplings .",
    "it can well reproduce the thermodynamics from lattice data above @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the deconfinement temperature  @xcite .",
    "even an ideal gas with thermal gluon mass can describe the gluon lattice data for thermodynamical quantities@xcite .",
    "thus , the thermodynamics obtained by lattice qcd appears to be consistent with a weak coupling picture of the qgp .",
    "however , the elliptic flow results at rhic and the lhc suggest a rapid thermalization and a very small value of the viscosity - over - entropy - density ratio @xmath3 , which is inconsistent with the weak coupling calculations based on kinetic theory  @xcite . such a small ratio can be obtained by the ads / cft correspondence at strong coupling@xcite .",
    "thus , the small value of @xmath3 supports a strongly coupled qgp ( sqgp ) .",
    "it is intriguing that one system can be estimated as weakly coupled for some phenomena while strongly coupled for others .",
    "it is still conceivable since the coupling constant runs with the typical momenta exchanged in the interactions on different space - time scales  @xcite .    the interaction measure , @xmath0 , defined in terms of the energy density @xmath4 and the pressure @xmath5 , is usually used to measure the interaction between partons in the lattice qcd . for an ideal gas with massless particles ,",
    "energy density is equal to 3 times pressure and @xmath6 .",
    "it is thought that sizeable @xmath7 may indicate strong interaction . the lattice qcd calculations indeed find that @xmath7 is sizeable at temperature region @xmath8",
    "@xcite , and it appears to support a strong coupling picture for the qgp .",
    "however , a non - interacting quasi - particle description with only temperature - dependent effective mass can also well explain the behavior of the interaction measure from lattice  @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present study is to give another explanation on the interaction measure obtained by lattice .",
    "we study a system without any interactions , i.e. , an ideal gas with massive particles .",
    "we first calculate the energy density , the pressure and the @xmath7 .",
    "we find that their dependences on temperature reproduce the qualitative features of the lattice result .",
    "@xmath7 is nonzero for an ideal gas , which demonstrates that the particle mass contributes to the interaction measure .",
    "we then further show that , in contrary to @xcite , in our study the particle mass can not fully explain the interaction measure obtained by lattice .",
    "there are sizeable residue interactions in the deconfined phase .",
    "it may give us some new insight into the nature of the plasma above the deconfined point .",
    "since both the interaction and the particle mass contribute to the interaction measure , in this section we will study a system without any interactions , i.e. , an ideal gas with massive particles , to separate their contributions .",
    "the reason we use an ideal gas is that we want to see the pure contribution of the particle mass when there are not any interactions .    for an ideal gas with particle mass @xmath9 at an equilibrium state described by @xmath10 ,",
    "the standard formulas of the quantum statistics give the energy density @xmath11 and the pressure @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the degeneracy factor , and @xmath14 stands for the single - particle distribution function with @xmath15 using the relativistic dispersion relation @xmath16 , we obtain @xmath17 the above equation tells us that the presence of mass always reduces the pressure below @xmath18 .",
    "it is easy to understand because massive particles move slowly at a given temperature and thus the thermal pressure reduces .",
    "the interaction measure is then @xmath19    in the following we fix the chemical potential @xmath20 for comparison with lattice results . at @xmath20 , the pressure in equation ( 2 ) ,",
    "the energy density in ( 1 ) and the interaction measure in ( 6 ) are only functions of @xmath21 and @xmath9 . in this paper",
    "the integrals for the quantum statistics are done numerically .",
    "besides , we also do a boltzmann statistics , i.e. , the quantum distributions are replaced by the boltzmann distribution in the above equations , which can be analytically done . for the pressure",
    ", a technique of integrating by parts with the relation @xmath22 is used .",
    "finally we obtain @xmath23 with @xmath24 .    at fixed mass ,",
    "e.g. @xmath25 gev , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are shown in figure 1(b ) , for both quantum statistics and boltzmann statistics .",
    "for easy of comparing , the lattice results are shown in figure 1(a ) .",
    "the lattice studies the equation of state of a real qcd matter at @xmath20 . in figure 1(a ) , a continuous increase of the energy density and the pressure is seen , indicating a crossover between the hadron gas and the quark gluon plasma , which is confirmed by later reference  @xcite .",
    "there are more recent results  @xcite on the qcd equations of state than shown in figure 1(a ) from reference  @xcite . in the temperature region @xmath29",

    ", @xmath5 and @xmath4 approach stefan - boltzmann limits marked as arrows in the figure .",
    "( the sb limits are given in appendix a. ) @xmath34 is nonzero and peaks at the temperature region where the pressure and the energy density increase rapidly , which is similar to the lattice result .",
    "it is interesting that , even an ideal gas has the similar trend as the lattice results for the qgp thermodynamics . besides , another kind of a more complicated weak - coupling calculations from the kinetic theory@xcite can describe the lattice data not only the trend but also quantitatively . in addition",
    ", an ideal gas with temperature - dependent mass also leads to good agreement with lattice  @xcite .",
    "the system used here is quite simple , which only reproduce the qualitative features of thermodynamic quantities .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate how much the particle mass contributes to the interaction measure . by comparing our results with the lattice results ,",
    "we can obtain the pure contribution of the particle mass .",
    "a quantitative analysis will be given in the subsequent paragraphs .",
    "2 .   as discussed before , for an ideal gas with massless particles , @xmath6 . in figure 1(b ) , it can be seen that @xmath7 is nonzero for an ideal gas with massive particles .",
    "the only difference between the two systems is the particle mass .",
    "thus , the lesson we learn from here is that , a nonzero @xmath7 does not certainly mean strong coupling since the particle mass contributes to this quantity .",
    "we use @xmath25 gev as an example to show the behavior of the interaction measure .",
    "similar to the lattice result , there is a peak at the temperature region where the energy density and the pressure grow fast . by changing the particle mass ,",
    "the curve of the interaction measure will shift its position , as shown in figure 2 .",
    "the @xmath7 peak shifts to low @xmath21 for small mass and to high @xmath21 for large mass . and",
    "the peak height is independent on mass for an ideal gas .",
    "this statement is valid for an ideal gas with either quantum statistics or boltzmann statistics .",
    "4 .   in figure 1(b ) , the peak height of @xmath34 for the ideal gas is 0.057 ( this value is for fermi - dirac statistics , 0.059 for boltzmann statistics , 0.061 for bose - einstein statistics ) , which is much smaller than the lattice calculation . in figure 1(a ) , the peak height is about 6.5 , while newer results from hotqcd collaboration favor a value of about 5.0 for the peak height  @xcite , and the continuum extrapolated result of the wuppertal - budapest collaboration indicates a peak height of about 4.1  @xcite .",
    "the great disparity in peak height between figure 1(a ) and figure 1(b ) can be partly attributed to the number of degrees of freedom of constituent particles .",
    "the degeneracy factor @xmath35 in the ideal gas system in figure 1(b ) .",
    "however , @xmath13 in the qcd matter considered by lattice refers to a large number of degrees of freedom , including gluon and three flavor quark , anti - quark which further count color , spin degeneracy . +    + taking the pressure for an example . in an ideal multicomponent gas ,",
    "the partial pressure of one component is @xmath36 , where the particle degeneracy factor @xmath37 represents the number of the internal degrees of freedom for the particle with mass @xmath9 , @xmath38 represents the pressure without any internal degrees of freedom .",
    "the total pressure of an ideal multicomponent gas can be expressed as @xmath39 similarly , @xmath40 and the interaction measure is @xmath41 in lattice calculations , only quark mass contributes to the interaction measure since gluon is massless , according to equation ( 6 ) . for three flavor",
    "qcd , there are two masses : @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath7 for these two masses are peaks at different positions . according to ( 12 ) , @xmath7 for the mixed gas will be a double - peak curve .",
    "+ the maximum value of @xmath7 in equation ( 12 ) , denoting as @xmath44 , is less than @xmath45 where @xmath46 represents the peak height of the @xmath7 curve with fixed mass @xmath9 . since the peak height is independent on mass for an ideal gas , then @xmath47 .",
    "thus we can infer that @xmath48 where @xmath49 for three flavor qcd , with the quark degeneracy @xmath50  @xcite .",
    "finally we get @xmath51 the value at the right hand side of the above equation is about 40% of the lattice result 5.0 reported by hotqcd collaboration  @xcite , and about 50% of the lattice result 4.1 reported by wuppertal - budapest collaboration  @xcite . therefore , from our analysis we can conclude that the pure contribution of the particle mass is not larger than ( 40 - 50)% .",
    "+ in this paper , we only focus on the peak height which depends on the interaction .",
    "the peak position may also shift by additional interaction .",
    "thus the peak position , i.e. , the temperature where the interaction measure gets maximum , for an ideal gas can not be used to compare with that of the lattice qcd .",
    "we use an ideal gas with massive particles to calculate the energy density , the pressure and the interaction measure , and compare them with that of the lattice results .",
    "an ideal gas has the similar trend as the lattice results for the qgp thermodynamics .",
    "we reproduce the qualitative features of the lattice results on the energy density , the pressure and the interaction measure by an ideal gas with massive particles .",
    "the interaction measure is nonzero for an ideal gas , which demonstrates that a nonzero @xmath7 does not certainly mean strong coupling .",
    "particle mass can make the interaction measure nonzero .",
    "the @xmath7 measured in the lattice qcd includes the contribution from the particle mass because they indeed use quark mass in the lattice calculation  @xcite . after counting",
    "the degeneracy number of the qgp , @xmath7 contributed by the particle mass explains less than ( 40 - 50)% of the lattice result .",
    "we infer that the other contribution comes from interaction .",
    "that means nonzero @xmath7 from lattice calculation does not mean strong coupling but does not exclude a strong coupling picture of qgp .",
    "it is still hard to know how strong is the coupling since it is hard to know the relation of the interaction measure with the coupling .",
    "the question how strong is the coupling needs further study .",
