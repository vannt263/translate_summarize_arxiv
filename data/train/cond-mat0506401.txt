    "<S> we rule out the lower - order @xmath21 mode , corresponding to a pear - shaped deformation , because it does not couple to the optical response , at least at the lowest order and in a spherically symmetric environment . </S>",
    "<S> both modes can only be excited by the isotropic heat pulse if the spherical symmetry of the particle s expansion is broken either by the substrate , or by the particle s shape . </S>",

    "<S> the ratio of its frequency to that of the breathing mode is constant . ]    </S>",
    "<S> interferometric pump - probe measurements of single metal particles have the double advantage of high sensitivity and of providing the full optical response , including phase and amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> we have imaged 10-nm particles with 1-ps pulses , but shorter resonant pulses would give access to even smaller particles . </S>",
    "<S> electronic properties such as scattering times could then be studied on a single - particle basis . on a longer timescale , we recorded time - traces of acoustical breathing modes , displaying particle - to - particle fluctuations in frequency and decay rate , and revealing the intrinsic damping of mechanical vibrations . </S>",
