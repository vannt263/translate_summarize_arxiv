    "two central problems pervade the standard model ( sm ) , namely understanding the how the scalar higgs mass is stabilized against radiative corrections and the origin of the disparate fermion masses .",
    "weak scale supersymmetry is well - known as the premiere solution to the first problem .",
    "the most successful attempts on the second are made primarily through flavor symmetries .",
    "it is natural to ask if we can construct a theory that can explain the fermion mass hierarchy simultaneously with an explanation of the gauge hierarchy problem .    moreover , there are reasons to suggest supersymmetry breaking and flavor symmetry breaking ought to be closely related in supersymmetric models .",
    "the main impetus arises from the supersymmetric nonrenormalization theorem that protects superpotential couplings from radiative corrections .",
    "in particular , couplings that vanish at one scale ( unbroken flavor symmetry ) remain zero for all scales at all orders in perturbation theory , unless one of the following occurs : ( i ) a mass scale , put into the theory `` by hand '' , explicitly or spontaneously breaks the flavor symmetry , ( ii ) nonperturbative effects generate yukawa couplings ( i.e. , the flavor symmetry is anomalous ) , or ( iii ) supersymmetry is broken @xcite . because we are interested in dynamically generating all scales below the planck scale , we discuss exclusively the latter possibility .    building a model that is both supersymmetric and incorporates a flavor symmetry",
    "is strongly constrained , particularly due to processes that can be enhanced by the presence of superpartners . in general ,",
    "any successful supersymmetric flavor model must have a spectrum of scalar partners of quarks and leptons that do not contribute to low energy processes beyond experimental bounds .",
    "it is possible to respect limits on flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) and cp violation @xcite , such as those from @xmath5 mixing , @xmath6 , and lepton flavor violation , if the model contains one of the following spectra of squarks and sleptons :    * their masses are generation independent ( `` degeneracy '' ) . * the scalar ( mass)@xmath7 matrices and the ( mass)@xmath7 matrices of their fermionic partners are both diagonal in the same basis ( `` alignment '' ) @xcite . * the masses of the first two generations are much larger than the weak scale ( `` decoupling '' ) @xcite .    to solve the flavor problem of the standard model , one must take care to respect the flavor problem of the minimal supersymmetric standard model as well .",
    "one possibility is that the two solutions are decoupled from each other .",
    "the flavor symmetry could be broken at a high scale @xmath8 , below which the effective action contains the normal ( ms)sm yukawa couplings .",
    "supersymmetry could then break in a hidden sector and the breaking be communicated via gravitational interactions @xcite or gauge interactions @xcite .",
    "gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking ( gmsb ) , in it s canonical form @xcite , leaves scalars of the same quantum numbers approximately degenerate , thus avoiding the flavor problem of the mssm . in supergravity - mediated models",
    "this problem can be circumvented by choosing boundary conditions for soft - breaking parameters that leave the sfermions approximately degenerate @xcite , or ( as has been suggested recently ) produce the decoupling solution @xcite . in these cases , diagonal soft masses",
    "would be generated , thereby respecting any flavor symmetry , and flavor breaking would only affect the form of supersymmetry breaking via the renormalization group .",
    "the other possibility is that the flavor symmetry dictates the form of the soft masses . as in the models of ref .",
    "@xcite , one or more u(1 ) flavor symmetries could restrict the quark and squark mass matrices to be approximately diagonal in the flavor basis .",
    "this approximate alignment of quark and squark masses is able to suppress the additional sparticle contributions to fcnc ( though to satisfy experimental bounds , the models are rather complex ) .",
    "similar efforts using a u(2 ) flavor symmetry that forced the first two generations of scalars to be degenerate at some scale was also able to suppress dangerous contributions @xcite .",
    "alternatively , supersymmetry could be broken by an `` anomalous '' u(1 ) gauge symmetry . in this scenario ,",
    "the first two generations carry equal non - zero charges and their scalar components become heavy and degenerate @xcite , and the u(1 ) could play the role of a flavor symmetry @xcite in a froggatt - nielsen mechanism @xcite . a completely different approach utilized a composite dynamical supersymmetry breaking ,",
    "in which in some cases promising fermion textures and heavy first and second generations could result @xcite .",
    "finally , several groups have recently studied the possibility of generating the yukawa couplings radiatively @xcite .    in this paper , gauge - mediation is utilized for the communication of supersymmetry breaking , which has several benefits for flavor physics .",
    "first , there naturally appears a hierarchy of scales in the simplest class of models , due to the separation of the dynamical supersymmetry breaking sector ( dsb ) , the messenger sector , and the mssm .",
    "furthermore , additional gauge symmetries are naturally required for the dsb fields to communicate their supersymmetry breaking to the messenger fields .",
    "the model presented here @xcite is supersymmetric , incorporates a gauged u(1)@xmath9 flavor symmetry , and utilizes a modified froggatt - nielsen mechanism to generate the necessary yukawa coupling hierarchy .",
    "the froggatt - nielsen mechanism @xcite was invented two decades ago in the context of the sm as a way to reconcile the hierarchy of yukawa couplings .",
    "the general principle is to forbid some tree - level yukawa couplings , but introduce additional matter that when integrated out gives rise to the smaller yukawa couplings . in our interpretation the third generation is considered `` fundamental '' , with nonzero yukawa couplings allowed even with the flavor symmetry unbroken , while fermion masses for the first and second generations arise after integrating out heavy fn fields .",
    "we also insist that couplings are of order one , by which we mean quantitatively that no couplings differ by more than a factor of ten ( i.e. , all couplings are larger than about @xmath10 ) . in this way",
    "our quantitative improvement over an ordinary supersymmetry model is to reduce the hierarchy of yukawa couplings @xmath11@xmath12 to @xmath13@xmath12 .",
    "we utilize the two - higgs doublet structure of the mssm and demand the yukawa couplings for the third generation also satisfy this requirement . for third generation yukawa couplings larger than @xmath10 , it follows that @xmath14 , which is the lower bound that we use in this paper .",
    "our analysis focuses almost entirely on one model @xcite , the minimal flavor - mediated model ( mfmm ) , that has one set of fields and one parameterized superpotential .",
    "we use the term `` flavor - mediated '' since the same gauge group that communicates supersymmetry breaking from the dynamical supersymmetry breaking sector also serves as the flavor symmetry . in this way",
    "supersymmetry breaking and flavor symmetry breaking are inseparably linked together , which is the precise meaning of `` flavor - mediation '' .",
    "the main thrust of this paper is to derive the complete phenomenological spectrum of this model so that the most promising experimental signals can be extracted . unlike ordinary gauge - mediation ,",
    "there are several technical subtleties in accurately calculating the spectrum at the lowest scales .",
    "we believe we have overcome the vast majority of these difficulties .",
    "the model does have several new couplings and masses that are not precisely known , forcing us to parameterize this ignorance and show the results as a function of these high(er ) scale quantities .",
    "there are , however , several contortions that could be done to the model",
    ". some of these could potentially address problems that we do not solve or only have partial solutions in the mfmm .",
    "for example , the @xmath0 problem persists in the mfmm , and we implement no particular solution ( instead fixing @xmath15 using electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) constraints ) .",
    "nevertheless , there are various ways that a @xmath0 term could be generated from the dynamics of the model .",
    "since the details of such @xmath0 term generation dynamics are essentially irrelevant to the low energy phenomenology , we can rightly neglect this issue for all practical purposes .",
    "the one aspect of the mfmm that may affect the weak scale phenomenology is the generation of neutrino masses .",
    "several experiments , in particular those measuring atmospheric and solar neutrinos , have now convincingly established that some ( if not all ) generations of neutrinos are very likely mixing with one another . this mixing presumably arises due to nonzero neutrino masses . with certain assumptions ,",
    "it is possible to modify and augment the mfmm to incorporate neutrino masses of a size that can generate mixings to explain both the atmospheric neutrino results @xcite and the solar neutrino results @xcite .",
    "however , no completely satisfactory solution is presented since specific assumptions about the physics at scales beyond the dsb scale are required .",
    "we will discuss this more fully in future work , but we are nevertheless encouraged by these preliminary results .    the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model - sec ] we describe in detail the sectors that make up the flavor - mediated model . the role and function of the flavor symmetry",
    "is given , along with the predictions for the fermion masses and ckm elements .",
    "the required and undetermined flavor charge assignments are given , as well as the resulting messenger  froggatt - nielsen superpotential . in sec .",
    "[ mediation - sec ] the mediation of supersymmetry breaking is discussed , and the resulting holomorphic and nonholomorphic contributions to the various fields are written . in sec .",
    "[ rge - sec ] the renormalization group evolution is discussed in detail , including several important effects that arise in our particular model .",
    "these include consequences of an anomalous u(1)@xmath9 below the scale of dynamical supersymmetry breaking , yukawa - mediated supersymmetry breaking contributions , and two - loop gauge contributions induced by heavy first and second generations . in sec .",
    "[ dynamics - sec ] we present many of the main results of our paper .",
    "we discuss in detail the relevant parameters of the model , and define a minimal parameter set associated with the mfmm .",
    "several phenomenological constraints restrict the parameter space in highly nontrivial ways , and we illustrate these constraints with a series of graphs and discussion . in sec .",
    "[ signals - sec ] the main signals of the model are discussed in detail .",
    "our emphasis is on the collider signals of the weak - scale spectrum , that depend ultimately on several factors ( mfmm parameters ) .",
    "we have been able to apply to our scenario several recent results from the literature that used event - level simulations , and this has allowed us to be rather precise in the predictions for the mfmm .",
    "we also discuss signals in low energy flavor processes ( i.e. , fcnc and cp violation ) .",
    "[ modify - model - sec ] is devoted to discussing some variations of the mfmm .",
    "our primary motivation is to briefly examine the impact of other choices of fn fields and superpotential couplings that result if the su(5 ) ansatz is relaxed .",
    "in addition , we discuss some directions toward a solution of the @xmath0-problem , and perhaps most importantly we discuss ways to augment and modify the mfmm to accommodate nonzero neutrino masses . finally , our conclusions appear in sec .",
    "[ conclusions - sec ] .",
    "there are essentially four sectors in this model . at the highest energy scales",
    "there is a dsb sector , of which we have certain requirements but we leave largely unspecified .",
    "some dsb sector fields are charged under an additional nonanomalous u(1 ) , which serves both as the messenger u(1 ) responsible for transmitting supersymmetry breaking to the messenger fields ( among others ) , and also acts as the flavor u(1 ) responsible for specifying the necessary ( or absent ) couplings in the model .",
    "vector - like messenger fields also serve in a dual capacity by transmitting supersymmetry breaking to the mssm via ordinary gauge interactions , and also as froggatt - nielsen ( fn ) fields that are needed to generate the effective yukawa coupling hierarchy . to emphasize the dual role of this sector",
    ", we call this the messenger  froggatt - nielsen sector , or simply `` fn sector '' . similarly ,",
    "froggatt - nielsen fields are called simply `` fn fields '' . in order to generate the yukawa hierarchy , several sm gauge singlets",
    "must also be present that are charged under the u(1)@xmath9 and obtain vacuum expectation values .",
    "these fields are called flavons , and in this model there are two distinct varieties .",
    "three @xmath16 fields are responsible for generating the supersymmetric mass for the vector - like fn fields , and as such indirectly assist the generation of the yukawa coupling hierarchy .",
    "five @xmath17 fields are solely responsible to generate the effective yukawa couplings , after the fn sector and the flavon sector is integrated out .",
    "any given yukawa coupling ( except those of the third generation ) or ckm element is ultimately proportional to the ratio @xmath18 .",
    "thus , judicious u(1)@xmath9 charge assignments with a properly generated flavon vev hierarchy give the required fermion masses and mixing angles .",
    "calculating the flavon vev hierarchy with eight flavon fields amounts to a doing a complicated multi - dimensional effective potential minimization .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that additional flavons are typically necessary to generate the required vevs , but they do not impact any other aspect of the model .",
    "we therefore simply assume flavons can be added such that the required local minimum is generated and is sufficient stable ( lifetime of the universe ) .",
    "more concrete work detailing the generation of flavon vevs with the desired minimum can be found in ref .",
    "finally , the mssm scalar fields acquire supersymmetry breaking masses from several sources .",
    "it is on this aspect of the model that we spend the most effort , since all signals of the model are crucially dependent on precise calculations of these weak scale quantities .",
    "we have already remarked that the first and second generation fields are charged under the u(1)@xmath9 .",
    "there are several immediate consequences of this which we now discuss .",
    "the motivating reason is to forbid the first and second generation yukawa couplings through the u(1)@xmath9 flavor symmetry .",
    "these couplings are regenerated in the effective theory through fn ladder diagrams with fn vector - like matter coupling to flavons and the first and second generations . since the first and second generations must be charged in this scenario ,",
    "the scalar components acquire two - loop u(1)@xmath9 gauge - mediated masses directly induced after integrating out the dsb sector .",
    "these are much larger than the contributions induced by ordinary two - loop gauge interactions after integrating out the fn sector .",
    "thus , the mssm fields also have a hierarchy : the first and second generations are expected to be much heavier than the other fields , due to the u(1)@xmath9 coupling .    to generate the proper hierarchy of fermion masses without generating significant squark mixing , the first and second generations should be assigned different u(1)@xmath9 charge for their component fields charge is assigned to respect an su(5 ) ansatz .",
    "this will be discussed below . ] .",
    "hence , the model generically has large differences between the first and second generation scalar masses which can induce large fcnc .",
    "this is precisely the supersymmetric flavor problem .",
    "however , their masses are expected to be much heavier than the other mssm fields , as explained above .",
    "it is well known that the decoupling solution to the fcnc problem in a generic mssm requires the first and second generation scalar masses to be so large they cause other phenomenological problems ( e.g. , unnatural contributions to the higgs masses , and third generation scalar masses running negative @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the decoupling solution must be augmented by some amount of degeneracy or alignment .",
    "such an `` effective supersymmetry '' spectrum has been discussed in different contexts in refs .",
    "@xcite and indeed has been recently advocated as the most natural scenario @xcite . in our model , it is remarkable that the same mechanism that allows the generation of the yukawa hierarchy and generates generically large splittings between the first and second generations , also solves the supersymmetric flavor problem since the first and second generations receive large supersymmetry breaking masses and the squark masses are approximately diagonal in the flavor basis .",
    "this one of the central motivations for pursuing this approach to flavor .",
    "the messenger u(1)@xmath9 is anomalous after the dsb sector is integrated out .",
    "this has several important consequences .",
    "a fayet - iliopoulos ( fi ) term is automatically generated at one - loop , but is calculable only by specifying a dsb model .",
    "fields charged under the u(1)@xmath9 acquire supersymmetry breaking masses near the dsb scale after the dsb fields are integrated out .",
    "furthermore , @xmath19 is necessarily nonzero , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are respectively the u(1)@xmath9 charge and the mass of the scalar field @xmath22 .",
    "this generates significant one - loop corrections to the u(1)@xmath9 charged scalar ( mass)@xmath7 , analogous to when hypercharge @xmath23-term is nonzero in other supersymmetric models .    to successfully accommodate the fermion masses and ckm angles with @xmath24 couplings",
    ", we must construct a ( modified ) fn model . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that the form of the fermion mass matrices is tightly constrained due to the restrictions on the first two generation masses and on the couplings of the up - type higgs . ] .",
    "although we will not repeat the detailed arguments , we do present the up - type quark , down - type quark , and charged lepton mass matrices in the notation used in this paper to show how the fermion masses are generated .",
    "after the u(1)@xmath9 breaks and we are in the proper ground state , several flavon fields acquire vevs .",
    "these have the effect of giving large ( supersymmetric ) masses to the fn fields and mixing fn fields with mssm fields of the same quantum numbers , leading to the mass matrices we present below .",
    "the generic form of the superpotential is @xmath25 where the @xmath26 and @xmath27 are fn fields , the @xmath28 are sm fields and @xmath29 is a higgs field .",
    "before any fn fields are integrated out , the up - type fermion mass matrix is @xmath30 where the columns represent ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) and the rows represent ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) .",
    "we have inserted the component superpotential parameters that are defined in appendix  [ superpot - component - app ] .",

    "notice that all mssm yukawa couplings are forbidden other than among the third generation , just as the @xmath62 flavor symmetry demands .",

    "this is a direct consequence of limiting ourselves to five @xmath73 pairs of ( color triplet ) fn fields",
    "@xcite suggest that @xmath74 is not excluded by experiment , and furthermore has the virtue of solving the strong cp problem , though this solution is as of yet controversial @xcite .",
    "modifications to the fn sector which allow for @xmath75 are discussed in sec .",
    "[ m - u - nonzero - sec ] .",
    "the charged lepton masses are equal to the down - type quark masses up to couplings of @xmath24 .",
    "for example , @xmath76 is the smallest ratio between the two sectors",
    ". thus ratios of individual couplings of @xmath77 can explain these mass differences .    to achieve this result the u(1)@xmath9 charges",
    "must be judiciously chosen , although several degrees of freedom remain even after all the constraints are satisfied .",
    "we require the first and second generations are charged respecting an su(5 ) ansatz , and all the other fields of the mssm ( third generation , higgs , gauginos ) are uncharged .",
    "although we do not attempt to embed the model in an su(5 ) gut , there are four main motivations to enforce the charge assignments commute with su(5 ) : it is sufficient for gauge coupling unification to be at least naively preserved ( to one - loop ) , u(1)@xmath9 anomaly cancellation and @xmath78 are relatively easy to achieve , and any assignment that did not compute with su(5 ) ( or su(4)@xmath65su(2)@xmath65su(2 ) , etc . )",
    "would immediately preclude any hope of embedding the model in a gut at the unification scale .",
    "having said this , we should also note that gauge coupling unification can be achieved with fields in representations that do not fit into su(5 ) or any group @xcite ( although such a messenger sector can not generate flavor ) and there are numerous examples of free fermionic string constructions that break directly to the sm gauge group , never passing through a gut in the first place .    assuming the charge assignments to fields are distinct and that the higgs and third generation fields are uncharged ,",
    "the above mass matrices imply the following constraints on the charges : @xmath79 furthermore , requiring the mixed [ su(5)]@xmath7u(1)@xmath9 anomaly to vanish imposes the additional constraint @xmath80 we can rewrite the charges of @xmath81 and @xmath82 as @xmath83 in terms of the ratio @xmath84 .",
    "thus , the set of undetermined charges can be taken to be @xmath85    naively the anomaly could be canceled with a particular choice of the first and second generations ( i.e. , applying the anomaly constraint on the four charges ) .",
    "however , this necessarily requires that some of the first and second generation charges have a different sign , which is phenomenologically excluded .",
    "( one of the ( mass)@xmath7 of the first or second generations would be negative . ) thus , at least one of @xmath86 or @xmath87 must be nonzero ( and negative ) .",
    "it turns out that to construct a viable effective potential that yields the desired hierarchy of flavon vevs requires that either @xmath86 or @xmath87 be larger ( in absolute value ) than the first and second generation charges .",
    "hence , the remaining charges for the @xmath88 flavons are the ratio @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "we nominally take @xmath90 to vanish for our analysis ( as it reduces contact between @xmath91 and u(1)@xmath9 charged fields ) , however we discuss the consequences of a nonzero charge for @xmath92 in sec .",

    "as we shall see , @xmath116 may be relatively large ( @xmath117 a few tev ) thus giving a large negative contribution to these third generation scalar ( mass)@xmath7s .",
    "this contribution is largely dependent on given superpotential couplings and unspecified flavon interactions . for simplicity",
    ", we assume @xmath112 is small enough such that we can ignore it , and take this as a mild constraint on the unspecified flavon superpotential .    the other exception is the contributions of @xmath26-terms to @xmath118 violation .",

    "feng , moroi @xcite , and martin , wells @xcite analyzed in detail the detectability of quasi - stable staus at the tevatron .",
    "they found that by searching for at least one highly - ionizing track ( hit ) per event , stau production could be probed for stau masses up to roughly @xmath399@xmath400 gev with between a few to tens of fb@xmath393 of data .",

    "the other source of suppression arises due to the cabibbo angle coming from the up sector .",
    "thus the gluino box diagrams which contribute to @xmath405 mixing are small because of both large scalar masses and small mixing .",

    "a definite signal from this model is enhanced @xmath409 mixing @xcite since first and second generation mixing at the quark - squark - gluino vertex is of order the cabibbo angle ( as expected since the cabibbo angle comes from this sector ) .",

    "the cabibbo - like mixing gives @xmath411 , which nearly saturates the current bound @xcite , and is two orders of magnitude above the sm estimate @xcite .",
    "the @xmath96 system will also receive significant contributions from superpartners .",
    "the signals are similar to those outlined in @xcite . in the flavor basis ,",
    "the mixing comes from the quark mass matrix .",
    "the squark mass matrix is nearly diagonal in this basis with respect to the third generation .",
    "the phase in the gluino box diagrams is different from the phase in the sm box diagrams ( @xmath412-exchange ) because equal portions of @xmath413 come from the up and down sectors . here",

    "left - right mixing matrices ( the off - diagonal blocks of the squark ( mass)@xmath7 matrices ) are of the same form as the corresponding quark mass matrices .",
    "thus , left - right mixing is in general small in this model . since the cabibbo angle does not originate from the down sector @xcite , the model does not predict any significant supersymmetric contributions to the recent measurement of @xmath124 @xcite .",
    "the allowed superpotential terms in the fn sector of the mfmm were guided by several restrictions @xcite :    * u(1)@xmath9 charge assignments must be compatible with an su(5 ) gut .",
    "* fn fields must be added in complete su(5 ) multiplets . *",
    "the number of fn fields must be less than ( the equivalent of ) five @xmath414 , @xmath415 pairs to allow for at least semi - perturbative couplings at the gut scale .",
    "* the ratio of the smallest to the largest superpotential couplings must not be less than @xmath10 .",
    "constraints from electroweak symmetry breaking and fcnc imposed additional restrictions on the model ( e.g. , @xmath91 could not couple to u(1)@xmath9-charged fields in the superpotential , and the first two generations had to be charged ) . in this section ,",
    "we examine the consequences of lifting some of these constraints .",
    "in addition , we discuss two important extensions of the model : dynamical generation of both a @xmath0-term and neutrino masses .",
    "there are , however , a few variations of the mfmm that do not require violating any of the above restrictions .",
    "one example is to take the charge of @xmath416 to vanish ( @xmath417 ) , remove the superpotential coupling @xmath418 , and include the couplings @xmath419 and @xmath420 .",
    "while this change does create a new parameter space , the low energy spectrum does not change dramatically in this new version , e.g. , we still expect one light stau with all other squarks and sleptons to be at or above about @xmath12  tev .      of the four criteria listed above , the first three involve unification , with criteria ( iii ) most relevant to ensuring the gauge couplings approximately unify at the high scale",
    ". criteria ( i ) ( charge assignments which commute with an su(5 ) gut ) is required for standard su(5 ) unification .",
    "criteria ( ii ) ( fn fields in complete su(5 ) multiplets ) is not necessarily required for an su(5)-invariant high energy theory , however one would be faced with highly split multiplets that represent an additional hierarchy problem [ analogous to the doublet - triplet splitting of the higgs field that must occur with su(5 ) ] .",
    "criteria ( iii ) ( maximum number of fn fields to preserve unification ) is a more general prediction of guts that need not be specific to su(5 ) , and could be imposed independent of the first two criteria .",
    "for example , some free fermionic string models break directly to the sm gauge group , also with possibly a nonstandard hypercharge normalization @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we explore models that do not satisfy criteria ( i ) and ( ii ) , instead satisfying merely criteria ( iii ) and ( iv ) , or just criteria ( iv ) only",
    ". one important consequence of these model variations is that the mass for the up quark is no longer necessarily zero , although we find that this occurs only for models that violate criteria ( i)(iii ) .",
    "relaxing the su(5 ) ansatz , fn fields now come in three varieties : @xmath421 , @xmath422 and @xmath423 pairs .",
    "one possible variation is to leave the field content alone and to allow the u(1)@xmath9 charges to deviate from the su(5 ) requirements .",
    "the benefit of this choice is that it allows the leptons to take different charges than the quarks , thus more easily accommodating their different masses .",
    "moreover , this variation could lead to a simple mechanism for generating neutrino masses ( see sec .",
    "[ neutrinos - sec ] ) .",
    "however , the deviation from su(5 ) comes at a cost : @xmath78 is no longer automatically satisfied .",
    "this trace must approximately vanish to avoid a large contribution to a fi hypercharge @xmath23-term @xcite .",
    "the soft masses are quadratic functions of the u(1)@xmath9 charges , and therefore this requirement is highly restrictive .",
    "regardless , it is possible to find charge assignments which violate su(5 ) , but in all of these variations the structure of the ( full ) quark mass matrices remains the same as in the mfmm case .",
    "variations in the particle content are perhaps more interesting .",
    "there are three viable fn sectors other than that of the mfmm that have @xmath424 pairs of additional quark triplets .",
    "all other possibilities are ruled out since they predict a zero eigenvalue in the down mass matrix or two zero eigenvalues in the up mass matrix .",
    "if @xmath425 ( with @xmath426 ) is the number of fn quark pairs , then these model variations can be labeled by the triplet @xmath427 . in this language , the four allowed models satisfying criteria ( iii ) are @xmath428 [ the mfmm ] , @xmath429 , @xmath430 , and @xmath431 .",
    "the second of these is the most interesting as it is the only one with only four pairs of fn quarks . in this model ,",
    "the gauge couplings remain completely perturbative up to the unification scale . the full up mass matrix for this ( as well as the third ) model is @xmath432 notice this matrix requires the right - handed charm quark to be uncharged with respect to u(1)@xmath9 .",
    "if the right - handed up quark is also uncharged , then the dominant contribution to the masses of the right - handed up - type squarks comes from the standard two - loop gauge interactions . for soft masses near 1",
    "tev ( as is typical in the mfmm ) , these squarks are very nearly degenerate and contributions to @xmath409 mixing from this sector are far below experimental bounds . in a sense",
    ", this is a hybrid model between gauge - mediated and flavor - mediated supersymmetry breaking . however , with this field content , @xmath433 because there is not a sufficient number of u(1)@xmath9 charged fields that have negative hypercharge to compensate the fields with positive hypercharge .",
    "the consequence of this large positive hypercharge @xmath23-term is typically that a scalar ( mass)@xmath7 , such as the stau , goes negative .",
    "in fact , all three of these variant field contents , ( 1,0,2 ) , ( 1,0,3 ) , ( 2,0,1 ) , do not work for this reason .",
    "thus , it is remarkable that the fn sector is completely fixed and unique simply by requiring @xmath434 .    in this framework , it is impossible to satisfy criteria ( iii ) and ( iv ) and have @xmath75 .",
    "giving up criteria ( iv ) and permitting @xmath91 to couple to charged fields does allow the up quark to gain a mass , but radiative ewsb is very difficult ( if not impossible ) to achieve .",
    "giving up criteria ( iii ) allows a somewhat reasonable model with a non - zero up mass ( though it is still difficult to satisfy ( iv ) in such models ) .",
    "the minimal field content for this type of model is ( 2,0,2 ) , although models with a larger field content need fewer small couplings . in these models",
    "the gauge couplings encounter a landau pole prior to the unification scale , and therefore apparently require new physics to appear at some lower scale . finally ,",
    "while all of these models can produce @xmath75 , the natural solution to the strong cp problem is lost .",
    "the one dimensionful parameter whose dynamical generation has not been accounted for is the superpotential mass parameter of the higgs superfields .",
    "the difficulty of naturally generating the superpotential coupling @xmath435 ( the so - called `` @xmath0-problem '' ) , exists in this model in the same way as it does in ordinary gauge - mediated scenarios . the problem is not one of generating @xmath0 of order the weak scale ( required by naturalness ) ; instead the problem is that most mechanisms that generate @xmath0 also generate a soft supersymmetry breaking scalar bilinear mass term @xmath436 that is much too large @xcite .",
    "we do not have anything significantly new to add to the discussion , except to describe the situation in the mfmm .    as described in the conclusion of ref .",

    "the leading contribution is the right size : @xmath439 times a group theory factor .",
    "however , there is a similar one loop contribution @xcite to the scalar bilinear @xmath440 which is much too large for ewsb to work naturally ( if at all ) .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite did offer a solution that should work in our scenario , but it requires a new dimensionful parameter ( although this could be dynamically generated as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . an alternative approach using an extra u(1 )",
    "( unrelated to our flavor u(1)@xmath9 ) whose breaking generates an effective @xmath0-term was pursued in the context of a chiral supersymmetric standard model in refs .",

    "there are several candidates in the model for @xmath98 , namely the flavons .",
    "the mfmm offers @xmath92 as a gauge singlet , however the vev of this field is clearly too large to generate @xmath0 .",
    "this provides sufficient motivation to give @xmath92 a non - zero u(1)@xmath9 charge , although we note that there are phenomenological constraints on the size and sign of this charge that we do not discuss further here .",
    "a more natural possibility is @xmath442 .",
    "this choice simply requires the constraint @xmath443 , and is natural because @xmath444 .",
    "however , again we face the problem of an overly large @xmath445 since , in general , we expect the @xmath26-term of @xmath446 to be of order @xmath447 .",
    "a priori this is not guaranteed , and the flavon interactions might produce a small @xmath26-term , though it seems unlikely .    finally , nilles and polonski @xcite produce a @xmath0-term via a gauge singlet that is coupled gravitationally to the dsb sector via the khler potential coupling @xmath448 , where @xmath173 is a dsb sector chiral superfield . if @xmath98 has a self - cubic coupling in the superpotential , then for @xmath449  gev , and @xmath98 has a vev of order the weak scale that can dynamically produce @xmath0 without producing a large @xmath445 .",
    "this mechanism can be implemented in the mfmm by adding an additional singlet or by again taking @xmath446 to be the singlet ( making the generation of its vev distinct from the other flavons ) .",

    "recent observations of zenith angle dependence in the number of atmospheric muon neutrino events @xcite together with the lower than expected measurements of solar neutrino flux @xcite suggest that ( at least two ) neutrinos have small non - zero masses . these experiments measure differences in ( mass)@xmath7 and find the relevant scales to be less than @xmath12  ev . the mfmm can not reproduce such a low scale in any reasonable way without invoking new interactions at a large mass scale .",

    "in this paper we have presented the phenomenology of a new economical model of flavor . within the context of gauge - mediation",
    ", we utilize the hierarchy of scales , extra vector - like ( messenger ) matter , and additional gauge group structure to provide not only a means to communicate supersymmetry breaking to the mssm fields , but also to generate the first and second generation fermion masses using a modified froggatt - nielsen mechanism .",
    "the identification of the messenger u(1 ) that communicates supersymmetry breaking from the dsb fields to the messenger - froggatt - nielsen fields is also the flavor symmetry in our model is essential . in particular , all of the first and second generations are charged under the u(1)@xmath9 and obtain flavor - dependent supersymmetry breaking contributions to their scalar masses .",
    "ordinarily this would be disastrous , however it is precisely because these fields are charged under the u(1)@xmath9 that implies these contributions are rather large , roughly equivalent to the dsb scale suppressed by a two - loop factor .",
    "hence , squark - induced fcncs are suppressed by the heavy mass scale , following the `` more minimal supersymmetry '' approach @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most fascinating phenomenological aspect of this model is that the fermion mass hierarchy and heavy first and second generation squarks are inextricably linked together .",
    "there are several subtle issues to construct a successful supersymmetric model of flavor along the lines we have discussed , and we merely summarize the results of these model - building efforts here . in sec.[dynamics - sec ] a simplified model was advocated as the `` minimal flavor - mediated model '' , that depends on four main scales : @xmath146 , @xmath481 , @xmath252 , and @xmath482 .",
    "several other parameters play an important role , including the normalized u(1)@xmath9 fi term @xmath196 , the u(1)@xmath9 gauge coupling @xmath147 , three superpotential parameters ( @xmath200 , @xmath281 , and @xmath282 ) that determine the size of yukawa - induced supersymmetry breaking contributions , and also @xmath188 .",
    "we discovered that there is a tight connection between the weak scale masses , including @xmath483 and the mass scale of the other third generation scalars , and the heavy first and second generation mass scale .",
    "increasing the ( absolute ) size of @xmath149 causes an increase in the first and second generation masses , but also causes a decrease in the mass of the lightest stau .",
    "this important result suggests a no - lose theorem for the model : either the stau is light and should discovered in an upcoming collider experiment , or the first and second generations are `` lighter '' , and should be manifest in future measurements of fcnc processes .",
    "the signals of the model depend heavily on three factors : the identity of the nlsp , the nlsp decay length , and the mass of the lightest stau .",
    "we showed that in the mfmm the decay length is always much larger than the scale of the detector ( hence the nlsp always _ escapes _ the detector ) , and the mass of the stau is always less than the mass of the lightest chargino and the second lightest neutralino .",
    "the nlsp is therefore either the lightest neutralino or the lightest stau . in both cases",
    "the production of the lightest chargino and/or the second lightest neutralino is expected to result in about one tau per chargino , and two taus per neutralino due to the two - body decays @xmath328 and @xmath327 .",
    "if the nlsp is the lightest neutralino , searching for these taus is the best method of discovering supersymmetry . in this scenario",
    "the most promising production processes are @xmath389 and @xmath396 , that lead to the @xmath484 and @xmath485 plus missing energy final states .",
    "if the nlsp is the lightest stau , then the stau itself should manifest itself as a charged track in the detector . depending on the energy of the stau , this could mimic a muon ( if @xmath486 ) or appear as a unique highly - ionizing track ( hit ) . searching for signals with at least one",
    "hit is the best search strategy for collider experiments .",
    "indeed , the reach of a high luminosity tevatron extends up to about two hundred gev for the lightest stau , and several hundred gev for the lightest chargino and second lightest neutralino @xcite .",
    "we should also remark that there are several other observables characteristic of our flavor model that we have not mentioned .",
    "the heavy first and second generation superfields are highly split in mass between their fermionic components and the the scalar components .",
    "it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that a consequence of nondegeneracy is an observable weak scale distinction between between the gauge coupling of fermions to gauge bosons , and the associated gauge coupling of a fermion and sfermion to a gaugino .",
    "unfortunately , measuring the difference between a `` gauge coupling '' and a `` gaugino coupling '' is not easy , especially for the electroweak couplings , since it requires plenty of observed sparticle production data .",
    "another important class of signals that are perhaps much more promising for our model are more precise fcnc measurements .",
    "we have already mentioned the important @xmath320 mixing process that is expected , although several other fcnc processes could provide a window on the ( scalar ) flavor structure of our model .",
    "the two outstanding problems of the mfmm that are not definitely resolved are the dynamical origin of the @xmath0-term , and the generation of neutrino masses consistent with the recent atmospheric and solar neutrino experiments .",
    "the value of @xmath15 for any successful weak scale supersymmetric model must be matched to @xmath304 , and thus a dynamical solution to the @xmath0-problem is really a model - building issue .",
    "several possible methods to generate @xmath0 were presented , although we remain agnostic about the mechanism that is best for this framework .",
    "generating neutrino masses is more a glaring problem for the mfmm , and we presented a few possible ways that this could be accomplished . in all cases",
    "one must introduce new physics at scales larger than @xmath146 to accomplish the usual see - saw mechanism . combining",

    "<S> the phenomenology of a new economical supersymmetric model that utilizes dynamical supersymmetry breaking and gauge - mediation for the generation of the sparticle spectrum and the hierarchy of fermion masses is discussed . </S>",
    "<S> similarities between the communication of supersymmetry breaking through a messenger sector , and the generation of flavor using the froggatt - nielsen ( fn ) mechanism are exploited , leading to the identification of vector - like messenger fields with fn fields , and the messenger u(1 ) as a flavor symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> an immediate consequence is that the first and second generation scalars acquire flavor - dependent masses , but do not violate flavor changing neutral current bounds since their mass scale , consistent with `` effective supersymmetry '' , is of order 10 tev . </S>",
    "<S> we define and advocate a `` minimal flavor - mediated model '' ( mfmm ) , recently introduced in the literature , that successfully accommodates the small flavor - breaking parameters of the standard model using order one couplings and ratios of flavon field vevs . </S>",
    "<S> the mediation of supersymmetry breaking occurs via two - loop log - enhanced gauge - mediated contributions , as well as several one - loop and two - loop yukawa - mediated contributions for which we provide analytical expressions . </S>",
    "<S> the mfmm is parameterized by a small set of masses and couplings , with values restricted by several model constraints and experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> full two - loop renormalization group evolution is performed , correctly taking into account the negative two - loop gauge contributions from heavy first and second generations . </S>",
    "<S> electroweak symmetry is radiatively broken with the value of @xmath0 determined by matching to the @xmath1 mass . </S>",
    "<S> the weak scale spectrum is generally rather heavy , except for the lightest higgs , the lightest stau , the lightest chargino , the lightest two neutralinos , and of course a very light gravitino . </S>",
    "<S> the next - to - lightest sparticle ( nlsp ) always has a decay length that is larger than the scale of a detector , and is either the lightest stau or the lightest neutralino . </S>",
    "<S> similar to ordinary gauge - mediated models , the best collider search strategies are , respectively , inclusive production of at least one highly ionizing track , or events with many taus plus missing energy . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , @xmath2 mixing is also a generic low energy signal . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the dynamical generation of the neutrino masses is briefly discussed .    </S>",
