    "for any @xmath236 , the group @xmath237 is abelian and consists of semisimple elements , i.e. is diagonalizable . in particular by rigidity @xcite*corollary",

    "this implies that the group @xmath239 has finite index in @xmath33 .",

    "we thus have a second , different proof that conjecture  [ conj1 ] holds when @xmath0 is perfect .",
    "as promised , in case @xmath14 is the multiplicative or norm-1 group of a finite dimensional @xmath0-division algebra , we can also eliminate the rank-1 case . by the proof of theorem  [ all_ss_thm ] it suffices to show that if @xmath18 is any split spherical @xmath1-pair of @xmath15 , then @xmath229<\\infty$ ] .",

    "also the conjecture stands proved modulo rank-1 @xmath1-pairs if @xmath2 contains no non - trivial unipotent elements .",
    "lastly we note that we have two main tools now to demonstrate that a split spherical @xmath1-pair @xmath18 of a reductive anisotropic group is trivial .",
