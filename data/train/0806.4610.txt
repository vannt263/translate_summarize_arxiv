    "identifying complete and reliable samples of agn has become a necessity for extragalactic surveys , whether the goal be the selection of agn candidates or the removal of agn `` contaminants '' .",
    "only when armed with complete samples of agn will we be able to determine the role of obscured accretion in the build - up of the present day black hole mass function , or accurately characterize the star - formation history of the universe .",
    "complete agn samples are also required to test proposed evolutionary theories in which black hole formation and star - formation are intimately linked by merger and feedback processes ( e.g. hopkins et al .",
    "2006 ) , ultimately producing the correlation between black hole mass and bulge velocity dispersion ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "unfortunately , the varied luminosities , accretion rates , orientations , and intrinsic obscurations of agn prevent any one selection technique from reliably identifying all of them .",
    "for instance , while current uv , optical , and x - ray surveys are capable of detecting unobscured agn , they miss many of the obscured agn and nearly all of the compton - thick agn thought to dominate agn number counts at both low and high redshift ( e.g. gilli et al .",
    "2007 ; daddi et al .",
    "2007a , b ) .",
    "likewise , only 10 - 15% of agn are radio - loud , making radio surveys relatively incomplete .    the multiband imaging photometer ( mips ; rieke et al .",
    "2004 ) and infrared array camera ( irac ; fazio et al .",
    "2004 ) instruments aboard _",
    "spitzer _ have provided sensitive surveys in multiple mid - ir bands . infrared selection with mips and irac data",
    "is being used widely to select agn candidates independently of their optical and/or x - ray properties .",
    "in addition to identifying agn in fields with little or no x - ray data , infrared selection criteria are capable of identifying heavily obscured agn missed in even the deepest x - ray fields ( e.g. donley et al .",
    "2007 ) . as such",
    ", ir selection has the potential to complement traditional agn selection methods and to yield a more complete census of agn activity .    in this paper , we critically review the following infrared selection criteria : ( 1 ) irac color - color selection , ( 2 ) irac power - law selection , and ( 3 ) ir - excess selection .",
    "the first selection method employs color cuts in two representations of irac 4-band mid - infrared ( mir ) color - color space ( lacy et al .",
    "2004 ; stern et al . 2005 ) , the second identifies agn whose irac seds are well - fit by a power - law ( alonso - herrero et al .",
    "2006 , donley et al .",
    "2007 ) , and the third selects red galaxies with large infrared to uv / optical flux ratios ( daddi et al .",
    "2007a , dey et al .",
    "2008 , fiore et al .",
    "2008 , polletta et al .",
    "the first two criteria are based on the same principle : the hot dust near an agn s central engine reprocesses absorbed uv , optical , and x - ray emission into short - wavelength mir emission , filling in the gap between the stellar emission that peaks near 1.5  and the long - wavelength dust emission features that dominate the seds of star - forming galaxies .",
    "the color - color and power - law selection criteria , however , differ in the range of mid - ir characteristics they include as possible agn indicators .",
    "the third selection method identifies sources in which heavy obscuration with reemission in the infrared diminishes the optical emission and/or enhances the infrared emission .",
    "this paper utilizes improved spectral templates with a sample of infrared color - selected , power - law galaxies ( plgs ) , and ir - excess galaxies in the ultra - deep goods - s field to test the reliability and completeness of these selection techniques over a wide range of sample properties . from this analysis",
    ", we then quantify the contribution of these approaches plus _ spitzer _ identification of radio - intermediate and radio - loud agn to the x - ray  selected agn population .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we describe the selection of the color - selected , plg , and ir - excess samples .",
    "the construction of high - reliability photometric redshifts is described in  3 , as are the overall redshift properties of the sample . in  4 , we briefly discuss the x - ray properties of our mips - selected sample .",
    "the infrared color selection criteria of lacy et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and stern et al .",
    "( 2005 ) are discussed in  5 , where we compare and contrast the two selection criteria , investigate the behavior in color space of the star - forming templates , determine the redshift and flux dependencies of the color selection techniques , and investigate the properties of the most secure color - selected agn candidates . in  6 ,",
    "we discuss the plg  selection criteria , and in  7 we investigate the ir - excess sources .",
    "finally , in  8 , we discuss the overall statistics of agn revealed by ir - based methods compared with x - ray  selected samples .",
    "a summary is given in  9 . throughout the paper ,",
    "we assume the following cosmology : ( @xmath8,@xmath9)=(0.3 , 0.7 , 72  km  s@xmath10  mpc@xmath10 ) .",
    "we take as our initial goods - s sample all mips sources detected at 24  to a flux density of @xmath11  @xmath1jy . at this flux limit",
    ", 99% of the mips sample are detected to @xmath12 .",
    "there are several advantages to choosing a flux - limited mips sample .",
    "first , agn ( and lirgs / ulirgs ) tend to be bright at 24  ( e.g. rigby et al . 2004 ) . selecting only those galaxies with @xmath11",
    "@xmath1jy  therefore retains all but the faintest agn while excluding 50 - 60% of irac - selected ir - normal star - forming galaxies at all flux densities .",
    "second , a mips flux - limited sample is not subject to the complicated slope - dependent selection bias present in irac selected samples due to the significant variation in the sensitivity of the 4 irac bands ( see donley et al .",
    "third , this selection gives a complete and well - defined sample of objects with extreme red @xmath13 $ ] colors .",
    "the mips 24  catalog of the goods legacy team ( dickinson et al .",
    ", in prep . )",
    "is comprised of 948 sources in the mips cdf - s legacy field with @xmath14  @xmath1jy . while this mips depth can be obtained over the full cdf - s , we chose to limit this study to the goods region to take advantage of the super - deep irac imaging .",
    "the relative depths of the limiting mips flux and the super - deep irac photometry ensure that essentially all mips sources have high s / n irac seds , allowing us to study in an unbiased way the irac properties of this flux - limited mips sample . to ensure that all agn candidates have sufficient x - ray coverage , we also required x - ray coverage of @xmath15  ks from the deep @xmath16 cdf - s x - ray dataset ( see giacconi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and alexander et al .",
    "( 2003 ) ) . despite this relatively low cut ,",
    "96% of the final mips sample have @xmath17  ms and 80% have @xmath18  ms .",
    "the resulting sample was drawn from an area of 195.3 sq .",
    "arcmin and contains 846 mips sources .",
    "the cdf - s is one of the best - imaged fields in the uv , optical , nir , and x - ray .",
    "we took advantage of this extensive multiwavelength dataset by creating an aperture - matched catalog using the uv - nir photometry of marzke et al .",
    "( 1999 , @xmath19 ) , vandame et al . ( 2001 , @xmath20 ) , arnouts et al . ( 2002 , @xmath21 ) , combo17 ( wolf et al . 2004 ) , giavalisco et al . ( 2004 , @xmath22 ) , le fvre et al . ( 2004 , @xmath23 ) , and galex ( @xmath24 ) ( see prez - gonzlez et al . 2005 and the ucm extragalactic database for more details ) .",
    "we then removed from our sample the 89 mips sources that had multiple optical counterparts that were ( 1 ) within a 2.5  search radius of the mips source and ( 2 ) separated by more than 0.5 .",
    "( at @xmath25 , it is difficult to distinguish between multiple counterparts and an extended / irregular source with multiple components . ) while we do not restrict our sample to regions covered by goods acs imaging , 83% of the mips sources in our sample have deep acs coverage .",
    "sextractor - selected irac sources were similarly matched to the mips sample after combining the super - deep irac data with data from the deep , wide - area , _ spitzer _ legacy program ( pi : van dokkum ) and the mips - gto irac program ( see prez - gonzlez et al .",
    "2008 for further details ) . to ensure accurate mir seds , we removed from the ir plg  and color - selected samples 32 sources with blended irac or mips photometry . of the remaining 725 mips sources that meet our criteria , 713 ( 98% ) have unique irac counterparts within a 2  search radius , and 699 ( 96% ) have @xmath26 irac detections in all 4 irac bands , allowing us to determine accurately the mir colors of essentially all members of the mips - selected sample . of the 12 sources without irac counterparts ,",
    "6 were not detected due to blending with a nearby source , 4 had badly centered mips positions , and 2 had faint irac counterparts that fall below our catalog limit .      after assigning irac counterparts , we separated the mips sample into three subsets : ir plgs , ir color - selected galaxies , and ir - normal galaxies .",
    "we defined as plgs  sources whose 4-band irac photometry is well - fit by a line of slope @xmath27 , where @xmath28 ( alonso - herrero et al .",
    "2006 ; donley et al .",
    "2007 ) . the effect of different cuts in @xmath29 will be discussed in  6 . to ensure a good fit",
    ", we required the chi - squared probability p@xmath30 ( the probability that the fit would yield a chi - squared greater than or equal to the observed chi - squared ) to exceed 0.1 .",
    "p@xmath30 tends either to lie close to 0.5 ( the probability that corresponds to a reduced chi - squared of 1 ) or is very small ( see bevington & robinson 2003 ) .",
    "this selection , which identified 55 plgs , was done using the linfit task in idl .",
    "this task takes the following 4-band input from irac :    @xmath31    @xmath32    @xmath33*\\delta f_{\\nu}/f_{\\nu}\\ ] ]    and returns the best fit slope , @xmath29 , and the chi - squared probability , p@xmath30 .",
    "while sources selected via this method are dominated by the agn in the mid - ir , we do not require that the power - law extend into the optical .",
    "consequently , many infrared - selected plgs  are dominated by stellar emission at wavelengths short of @xmath34  , where the reprocessed emission from hot dust is suppressed because of dust sublimation .",
    "color - selected galaxies were defined as sources that meet the agn irac color - cuts of lacy et al .",
    "( 2004 ) or stern et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , but that * do not meet the plg  criterion*. as discussed in alonso - herrero et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and donley et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , both the plg  and irac color cuts attempt to select luminous agn that outshine their host galaxies in the infrared , filling in the dip in a galaxy s sed between the short - wavelength stellar emission feature and the long - wavelength dust emission features . as such ,",
    "the irac agn color selection regions contain , but also extend beyond , the power - law locus in color space .",
    "while nearly all plgs  meet the irac agn color selection criteria , not all color - selected galaxies meet the plg  criteria . we therefore separate color - selected sources that can be identified via a power - law fit ( plgs ) from those that can not ( color - selected galaxies ) .",
    "the color - selected sample consists of 210 sources , 188 of which meet the lacy et al .",
    "criteria , 72 of which meet the stern et al .",
    "criteria , and 50 of which meet both criteria .    finally , we define ir - normal galaxies as sources that meet neither the irac plg  nor the color selection criteria ; these sources comprise the remaining 448 galaxies in the mips sample .",
    "as they are not the focus of this study , we have not checked their irac and mips photometry by eye .",
    "instead , we estimate that the fraction of ir - normal galaxies with blended irac or mips photometry is similar to that found for the plg  and color - selected samples , 11% , or @xmath35 galaxies .",
    "we caution that ir - normal does _ not _ mean purely star - forming .",
    "instead , ir - normal only indicates that any mid - ir emission from an agn is overwhelmed by emission from the host - galaxy .",
    "in fact , many type 2 and seyfert - luminosity agn meet the ir - normal criteria ( stern et al . 2005 , donley et al .",
    "2007 , cardamone et al . 2008 ) .",

    ", we plot the redshift evolution of these templates in irac color - color space over @xmath83 , where purple and blue tracks represent the _ purely star - forming _ ulirg and lirg templates of rieke et al .",

    "large circles mark the tracks at @xmath84 , and small circles mark each integer redshift from @xmath85 to 4 .",
    "while the star - forming templates generally avoid the power - law locus itself , they enter the lacy and stern selection regions at both low and high redshifts , tracing out the same regions in color space occupied by many of the color - selected agn , particularly those selected via only one of the two criteria . the templates therefore suggest potential star - forming galaxy contamination of the color - selected agn , as previously predicted by barmby et al .",

    "( 2007 ) , and cardamone et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , and indicate that the current agn selection regions may inadequately separate agn and star - forming galaxies .",
    "our results can be compared with the simulations of sajina , lacy , & scott ( 2005 ) , who calculated mathematical models of galaxies from three spectral components : stars , aromatic features , and a continuum . for @xmath86 , we agree with their figure 8 ( upper left ) that starburst luminosity galaxies do not significantly invade the lacy agn color wedge ( see our figure 4 ) . however , we find that more luminous galaxies can invade this wedge much more seriously ( again see figure 4 )",
    ". the difference may arise because the inputs to their models included few star - forming lirgs and only one ulirg ( arp 220 , an atypical case ) .",
    "therefore , it is likely that the behavior of the most luminous star forming galaxies is not captured as accurately in their models as is that of lower luminosity ones . by @xmath85 , the typical _ spitzer _ 24  survey sensitivity limit reaches only to the bottom of the lirg range ,",
    "so the lacy agn color wedge is more susceptible to contamination than was concluded by sajina et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .",
    "while the star - forming templates appear to trace quite well the positions of many of the color - selected galaxies in color - color space , figure 4 covers a wide range of redshifts ( @xmath83 ) . to understand better the overlap between the star - forming templates and the color - selected galaxies ( and plgs ) , we must take the redshift information into account .",
    "we therefore break the sample down into smaller redshift bins , as shown in figures 5 and 6 .",
    "we overplot on the color - color diagrams the redshift - appropriate colors of purely star - forming galaxies . to simplify the plots",
    ", we do not plot each galaxy track separately , as was done in figure 3 , but instead draw 1 @xmath56 contours around the tracks , where @xmath56 is taken to be the median irac measurement error of the full mips sample .",
    "we find that , unlike the plgs , the majority of the color - selected agn candidates fall within or very close to the contours for star - forming galaxies of similar redshifts .",
    "thus , it is likely that their mid - ir seds are dominated by star formation .",
    "this result suggests that simple mid - ir color - color cuts can not identify reliable agn samples without also including redshift - based or additional sed ( e.g. power - law ) criteria .",
    "we discuss in appendix b the individual redshift intervals .",
    "the summary of our findings can be found in table 3 , where we present the overall fraction of color selected galaxies and plgs  that lie outside the 1 , 2 , and 3@xmath56 star - forming contours .",
    "the top half of the table gives the fractions assuming no errors on the photometric redshifts ; the lower half incorporates 10% errors which for clarity are imposed on the templates rather than on the individual galaxy measurements . for the plgs , we give two percentages : the fraction of sources that lie outside the star - forming contours in lacy and stern color - space , respectively .    as is clear from table 3 , the fraction of color - selected galaxies that lie outside the star - forming contours is lower than that of the plgs  by a factor of 2 - 10 at all three levels of significance .",
    "for instance , while 57% - 71% of plgs  lie more than @xmath36 from the star - forming contours in lacy color space , the same can be said for only 5%-10% of the color - selected galaxies .",
    "in addition , increasing the significance from 1@xmath56 to 3@xmath56 has a far greater effect on the reliability of the color - selected galaxies than on that of the plgs , especially in lacy color - space , indicating that the color - selected galaxies lie noticeably closer to the star - forming templates than do the plgs , as expected .",
    "we note that this analysis depends on the templates being used , as the addition or removal of any one star - forming template will result in changes in the numerical results presented above and in the table .",
    "the overall trends discussed above , however , will remain the same .      while the majority of color - selected agn candidates lie inside the star - forming contours ( see table 3 ) , a number of non - power - law color - selected galaxies meet the agn selection criteria and have colors inconsistent with those of our star - forming templates .",
    "are these agn , as predicted ?",
    "how do their redshift distributions , x - ray detection fractions , and numbers compare to those of the plgs ? in the following discussion , we define as secure color - selected galaxies ( and plgs ) those agn candidates that lie @xmath87 away from the redshift - appropriate star - forming templates .",
    "as discussed above , and as shown in figure 2 , the redshift distributions of the color - selected sources show a strong peak at @xmath88 , attributed to the 7.7  aromatic feature , a star - formation indicator .",
    "in contrast , the plgs  have a relatively flat redshift distribution , indicating little or no contribution from aromatic features .",
    "if we do not account for errors in the photometric redshifts , the resulting sample of secure color - selected galaxies retains the large @xmath89 peak , suggesting a large star - formation contribution .",
    "if we incorporate 10% errors on the redshifts of the star - forming templates when selecting our secure candidates , however , the redshift distributions of the remaining color - selected galaxies become relatively flat , with mean redshifts of @xmath90 and @xmath91 for the lacy and stern - selected sources , respectively , suggesting that a significant fraction of the high - redshift star - forming contaminants have been removed . for comparison ,",
    "the mean redshifts and rms ranges of the secure plgsselected in lacy and stern color - space are @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "while the redshift distribution therefore suggests that many of the star - forming contaminants have been rejected from the secure sample , the x - ray detection fractions , shown in table 4 , suggest otherwise . at distances of 1 and 2 @xmath56 from the star - forming templates , the x - ray detection fraction of the plgs  exceeds that of the color - selected galaxies by factors of @xmath94 .",
    "this factor , however , should be taken with reservations ; x - ray sources are far more likely to have spectroscopic redshift estimates , and are therefore far more likely to be included in our secure sample , which requires redshift information .",
    "while this has a minimal effect on the color - selected galaxies , for which the redshift completeness is high , it has a large effect on the plgs , boosting their probable x - ray detection fraction .",
    "a better comparison is therefore with the ir - normal galaxy population , 11% of which are detected in the x - ray .",
    "the x - ray detection fractions of the secure color - selected agn candidates ( 14 - 29% ) , exceed this value , but only by a factor of @xmath95 . in comparison",
    ", the full sample of plgs  has an x - ray detection fraction of 45% , which exceeds that of the ir - normal galaxies by a factor of 4 . only at the highest significance , @xmath36 from the star - forming contours , does the x - ray detection fraction of the secure color - selected galaxies approach that of the full plg  sample .",
    "this significant offset in x - ray detection fraction could be due either to a difference in intrinsic luminosity or to lingering contamination of the color - selected sample by star - forming galaxies . while the average x - ray luminosity of the secure plgs , log  @xmath77(ergs  s@xmath10)@xmath96 , exceeds that of the secure lacy and stern - selected sources detected in the x - ray , log  @xmath77(ergs  s@xmath10)@xmath97 and 43.9 , respectively , the offset is relatively small , suggesting that the large discrepancy in the x - ray detection fractions is not driven primarily by a systematic offset in x - ray luminosity of the relevant agn .",
    "instead , it likely arises from the inclusion of star - forming galaxies , even in the @xmath98 secure color - selected population , suggesting that a larger cut in @xmath56 ( e.g. @xmath36 ) is required to define a reasonably secure sample .    also shown in table 4 are the total number of x - ray selected galaxies in both the secure color - selected and plg  samples . after applying completeness corrections for the fraction of lacy , stern , and plg  x - ray sources that have redshifts and that can therefore be included in the secure sample ( 94% , 83% , and 76% , respectively ) , the number of secure x - ray selected plgs  exceeds that of the secure x - ray  detected color - selected galaxies , regardless of whether we define the secure sample as those sources that lie 1 , 2 , or 3@xmath56 from the star - forming contours",
    "this indicates that _ the plg  selection criterion identifies the overwhelming majority of secure agn candidates in irac color - space .",
    "_      while the lacy and stern agn selection criteria were defined using relatively shallow surveys , these selection techniques are now being applied to samples with a range of flux densities ( e.g. cardamone et al .",
    "how does the limiting flux affect the completeness and reliability of agn color selection ?",
    "are the problems discussed above present in shallow as well as deep surveys ?",
    "there are several reasons why we might expect to see a shift in reliability with flux .",
    "first , the agn fraction of mips sources depends quite strongly on the 24  flux density ( e.g. treister et al .",
    "2006 , brand et al .",
    "for instance , while only @xmath99 of mips sources at our flux limit of 80  @xmath1jy  are expected to be agn ( treister et al .",
    "2006 ) , the fraction at 5  mjy is more than an order of magnitude greater ( @xmath100 ) . therefore , mips - selected shallow surveys should contain fewer star - forming galaxies , although those that remain are likely to be lirgs / ulirgs that enter the agn selection region in greater numbers than spirals and starbursts ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "second , many of the problem sources that lie inside the agn color selection region but that also fall inside the star - forming contours have moderately high - redshifts ( @xmath101 ) , and are therefore likely to drop out of shallow surveys .",
    "while shallow samples may therefore contain high - luminosity ulirgs , the exclusion of lower - luminosity high - redshift galaxies reduces the risk of contamination .",
    "other flux cuts , such as the @xmath102 magnitude @xmath103 requirement of stern et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , also prevent contamination at high-@xmath47 , as normal galaxies at this magnitude are detected only to @xmath104 .    to investigate the effect of intermediate flux density cuts on the agn color selection , we show in table 5 the fraction of secure color - selected and plgs  ( those that lie outside the 1@xmath56 star - forming contours ) as a function of flux density .",
    "if we do not incorporate errors in the photometric redshifts into our definition of the secure sources , we find that the fraction of secure sources is relatively constant at @xmath3 regardless of flux density .",
    "if we allow errors on the photometric redshifts when constructing our secure sample , the reliability of lacy - selected sources at @xmath105  @xmath1jy  drops to 29% , and that of stern - selected sources drops to 21% . at @xmath106  @xmath1jy , the fraction of secure sources amongst both samples rises , but only to 50% .",
    "regardless of our assumptions , therefore , the fraction of potential contaminants is still high ( @xmath3 ) , even at the highest fluxes probed by our survey .",
    "because of the pencil - beam nature of the cdf - s survey , 95% of the sources in our sample have @xmath107  @xmath1jy , so our ability to comment on brighter samples is limited .",
    "it is also worth noting that the brightest mips sources tend to lie above the power - law locus in lacy color - space and to the right of the power - law locus in stern space , regions where we expect minimal contamination from star - forming galaxies .",
    "not surprisingly , these sources are also almost always detected in the x - ray , suggesting that these regions of irac color - space are the most secure .      in a study of 77 agn candidates selected from the _ spitzer _ first - look ( lacy et al . 2005 ) and swire surveys ( lonsdale et al .",
    "2003 ) via the lacy et al .",
    "( 2004 ) criteria , lacy et al .",
    "( 2007 ) found that 33% are unobscured type 1 quasars , 44% are type 2 agn , and 14% are dust - reddened type 1 quasars .",
    "only 9% have star - forming or liner spectra .",
    "is this relatively low contamination by star - forming galaxies consistent with our findings ?",
    "there are three main factors that lead to the high reliability of the lacy et al .",
    "( 2007 ) sample .",
    "first , the sample members are very bright , with a typical 24  flux density of 5  mjy . as discussed above , treister et al .",
    "( 2006 ) predict that 45% of sources at this flux density should be agn , regardless of their mir seds , compared to only 4% of sources at our flux limit of 80  @xmath1jy .",
    "indeed , of the brightest 50 sources in the xfls ( whose median 24  flux density is 9.4 mjy ) , 58% are optically classified as agn ( lacy et al .",
    "thus , the sample from which these color - selected agn was drawn contains far fewer star - forming galaxies than the deeper goods sample .",
    "second , while the sources in the lacy et al .",
    "( 2007 ) sample have redshifts ranging from @xmath108 to 4.27 , the median redshift of the sample is low : @xmath109 .",
    "only 5 color - selected sources have redshifts in excess of @xmath110 , the redshift above which nearly all sources in our sample ( agn or star - forming ) meet the lacy et al . criteria .",
    "we would therefore expect little or no contamination by _ high - redshift _ star - forming galaxies , the predominant source of contamination in our faint sample .",
    "the third and most important reason for the high reliability of this sample , however , is the high plg  fraction of the lacy - selected agn candidates . of the 77 sources in the lacy et al .",
    "( 2007 ) sample , 59 are plgs  as defined in  2 .",
    "the 18 sources that are excluded by the plg  criteria include the only two starburst galaxies detected in this subsample , one starburst / liner , an unclassified high - redshift galaxy with narrow uv emission lines , two composite galaxies , 8 type 2 agn ( the identification of 4 of which were based on a bpt analysis ) , 3 reddened type 1 agn , and 1 type 1 agn . if we relax the probability constraint of the plg  criterion to p@xmath111 , as was done in alonso - herrero et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , we recover 69 of the 77 lacy et al .",
    "( 2007 ) sources selected for optical follow - up . excluded are the two starburst galaxies , one high - z unidentified galaxy , three type 2 agn , one reddened type 1 agn , and 1 type 1 agn whose slope of @xmath112 falls just short of our cut of @xmath27 .",
    "the high reliability of this luminous color - selected sample is therefore consistent with our findings in  6 that while non - plgcolor - selected agn are subject to contamination by star - forming galaxies , sources selected via a power - law criterion are reliable .",
    "thus far , we have focused primarily on the reliability of the agn color selection criteria of lacy et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and stern et al .",
    "in doing so , we have separated out the subset of sources that meet the power - law criteria of alonso - herrero et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and donley et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . here",
    ", we discuss the plg  selection itself , in particular the consequences of various choices of limiting power - law slope , @xmath29 .",
    "our default cut of @xmath81 was chosen to match the spectral indices of typical agn ( e.g. alonso - herrero et al .",
    "2006 , donley et al .",
    "2007 ) . in the optical ,",
    "agn have spectral slopes of @xmath113 to -2 ( sdss , ivezi et al .",
    "2002 ) , with a mean value of @xmath114 ( neugebauer et al . 1979 , elvis et al .",
    "1994 ) . in the irac bands , broad - line agn exhibit similar slopes , with a mean value of @xmath115 ( stern et al . 2005 ) .",
    "in figures 7 and 8 , we plot plgs  selected via cuts in @xmath29 ranging from + 0.5 to -1.5 . at high redshift ( @xmath116 )",
    "the irac bands trace the blue side of the stellar bump .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that at the bluest slopes ( @xmath80 ) , the plgsample is dominated by the population of high redshift x - ray  non - detected star - forming galaxies discussed above . as the required slope reddens towards our cut of @xmath81 , the high - redshift star - forming galaxies gradually drop out of the sample , and the x - ray detection fractions rise from 21% at @xmath117 to 30% , 45% , 67% , 88% , and 80% at @xmath118 and -2.0 .",
    "while choosing a redder cut in @xmath29 therefore increases the apparent reliability of the plg  selection , it also decreases the number of galaxies selected , and may exclude interesting heavily obscured , x - ray  non - detected agn like those seen in the cdf - n ( e.g. donley et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the x - ray  non - detected plgs  in the current sample tend to be the faintest sources both in the irac bands and at 24  , where their mean flux density , 146  @xmath1jy , is over a factor of 2 lower than that of the x - ray  detected sample , 334  @xmath1jy .",
    "the low x - ray detection fraction of these faint sources may therefore be due simply to their systematically lower fluxes . at @xmath119 , however , the star - forming ulirg templates have irac seds that meet the plgcriteria , although dropping the power - law slope criterion to @xmath120 and @xmath121 raises this redshift range to @xmath122 ( depending on the template ) and to @xmath123 , respectively ( with the iras  22491 - 1808 template never reaching an @xmath29 of -1.5 ) .",
    "it is therefore possible that the x - ray non - detected plgs  ( which tend not to have redshift estimates , to be faint , and to lie at relatively high @xmath29 ) are high - redshift star - forming galaxies . to test this hypothesis , we plot in figure 9 the ratio of the mips 24  flux density to that of the 3.6  irac band . at the redshifts of interest ( @xmath124 )",
    ", this flux ratio allows a direct comparison of the hot dust emission at 5 - 7  to the stellar emission at @xmath125  .",
    "overplotted on the colors of our mips - selected sample are the redshifted colors of the agn templates of polletta et al .",
    "( 2007 , see table 1 ) and the purely star - forming lirg and ulirg templates of rieke et al .",
    "the mean colors of plgs  without redshift estimates are given by large symbols placed at @xmath126 , the redshift above which contamination by star - forming galaxies is possible .",
    "the circle , square , and triangle represent all plgs  without redshifts , those that are detected in the x - ray , and those that are not , respectively .",
    "as can be seen in figure 9 , the x - ray  detected and x - ray  non - detected plgs  lacking redshifts have consistent 24  to 3.6  colors , suggesting that there is no significant difference between these two sub - samples .",
    "in addition , while the colors of these sources are consistent with those of agn , they lie well above those of star - forming galaxies , not only at high redshift , but at all redshifts greater than @xmath127 .",
    "in other words , the plgs  that are undetected in the x - ray and that lack redshifts ( preventing us from testing their reliability as in  5.3 ) appear to have more hot dust emission than can be explained by purely star - forming templates , especially at high - z where star - forming contamination of the plg  sample is most likely .",
    "this result suggests that these sources are more likely to be agn than star - forming galaxies .",
    "other lines of evidence , e.g. variability ( klesman & sarajedini 2007 ) , and x - ray properties ( steffen et al . 2007 ) , tend to support this conclusion . in addition , we note from figure 9 that a number of the other galaxies at @xmath128 have colors slightly redder than those predicted by star - forming galaxies at this redshift",
    ". this behavior may be due to a minor issue with the templates , a small agn contribution to the mir flux density , or to reddening that exceeds that seen in our local lirg / ulirg templates .    finally , the segregation of the x - ray  detected and x - ray  non - detected sources about the power - law locus , seen in figures 7 and 8 , warrants discussion , as this was not seen in the cdf - n ( donley et al .",
    "this behavior appears to be due largely to the different selection methods and limiting fluxes of the two samples .",
    "while the cdf - n plg  sample was selected on the basis of irac fluxes , the current sample was selected from a flux - limited mips sample with far deeper irac data .",
    "if we require the cdf - s sample to meet the irac detection limits of the cdf - n study , the plg  sample size decreases by a factor of 2 and the x - ray detection fraction rises to 78% .",
    "the segregation in the plg  sample is also greatly reduced , due largely to the loss of many of the x - ray  non - detected sources .",
    "this high x - ray detection fraction of 78% , however , is surprising as it is significantly higher than the 55% found for the cdf - n plg  sample . to test whether this change is a result of the much improved irac data",
    ", we recalculated the spectral properties of the galaxies in the cdf - n using the most current irac data , which now includes the super - deep goods - n coverage not previously available .",
    "drawing plgs  from the same initial sample used in donley et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , we find an updated x - ray detection fraction of 57% , a value nearly identical to that found previously . for consistency with the current sample , we further restricted the plg  sample to those sources detected in the super - deep goods field , where the x - ray exposure is generally higher .",
    "doing so raises the x - ray detection fraction to 65% .",
    "the remaining offset in the x - ray detection fractions of the irac flux - limited plgs  in the goods - n and goods - s fields , 13% , therefore appears to be due primarily to cosmic variance and small number statistics .",
    "both high - redshift star - forming galaxies and agn can exhibit extremely red infrared to optical colors when heavily dust - obscured ( e.g. dey et al . 2008 ) . while the relative fractions of agn and star - forming galaxies among ir - excess samples is still a matter of debate , the fraction of dust - obscured galaxies ( dogs ) with agn - like power - law seds has been shown to decrease with decreasing flux from @xmath129 at @xmath130  mjy to @xmath131 at @xmath132  @xmath1jy  ( dey et al . 2008 ) .",

    "f. fiore ( private communication , 2008 ) likewise concludes that @xmath217 of the x - ray non - cataloged sources in our sample are obscured agn .",
    "if so , our mips sample in the isaac field should contain 25 x - ray weakly or non - detected fiore - selected agn .",
    "of the 36/42 x - ray non - cataloged fiore sources in our sample ( which do not lie too close to a known x - ray source to test for faint emission ) , however , only 10 ( 28% ) are x - ray weakly - detected ( with properties indicative of heavy obscuration ) .",
    "the remaining 26 sources show no evidence for x - ray emission , and have properties that may also be consistent with star - formation .",
    "we therefore only consider the contribution from the 10 weakly - detected sources . of these 10 sources , 3",
    "are weakly - detected power - law galaxies . correcting for the isaac field of view ( and the 6 sources for which we could not test for weak x - ray emission ) results in an additional contribution of 12.0 agn , or 14% .      by combining the contribution of reliable power - law ,",
    "color - selected , radio / infrared , and ir - excess agn candidates , we therefore estimate that _ spitzer_selected samples increase the known x - ray  selected agn population by @xmath218 , down to a 24  flux density of 80  @xmath1jy .",
    "in addition , the radio / infrared selection implies a @xmath219 contribution from radio - excess and radio - quiet agn yet to be identified .",
    "the number of agn with 24  flux densities @xmath220 80  @xmath1jy  is therefore @xmath5 larger than that of current samples detected both in the x - ray and at 24  in the deepest x - ray fields .",

    "we verify this trend , showing excellent agreement with the brand et al .",
    "results ( see figure 13a ) , and confirm that it continues down to @xmath222  @xmath1jy . at lower flux densities , however , the fraction of mir - dominated x - ray agn begins to decrease at a much lower rate , and that of all mir - dominated agn plateaus at a value of @xmath223% .",
    "this indicates that a non - negligible fraction of faint mir sources are not powered primarily by star - formation , but by their central engines .",
    "the significant number of faint 24  sources that are agn - dominated in the mir is consistent with the finding of 6/19 such objects in the spectroscopy of faint 24  sources by rigby et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . at these low flux densities",
    ", it is also evident from figure 14a that the majority of the mir - dominated agn are not detected in the x - ray .",
    "for instance , at 80  @xmath1jy , the total number of mir - dominated agn outnumbers that of mir - dominated x - ray agn by a factor of @xmath224 . using only the x - ray emission as a probe of agn activity will therefore result in a serious underestimation of the agn contribution to the mir flux density .",
    "finally , we plot in figure 14b the fraction of all agn in the mips sample ( not only those whose mir flux is dominated by the agn ) , as a function of mips 24  flux density . to account for the contribution of the agn amongst the 14 x - ray sources lacking redshifts , we randomly add 11 , or 77% ( the agn fraction of the x - ray sample ) , of these 14 x - ray sources to the x - ray agn sample .",
    "we further supplement the agn sample by including the assumed contribution from radio - excess and radio - quiet agn , 17% , or 14 sources . because these sources have not been individually identified in the cdf - s ,",
    "we draw their flux densities randomly from the range of observed flux densities in the cdf - n ( @xmath225  @xmath1jy ) .",
    "the x - ray non - detected agn still comprise the majority of all agn at the lowest 24  flux densities , and their contribution at larger flux densities is significant , raising the agn fraction to @xmath226 at all 24  flux densities .",
    "as was seen for the mir - dominated agn , the total fraction of agn rises with increasing mir flux density , reaching a value of 37% at @xmath227  @xmath1jy , 15% higher than that of mir - dominated agn of the same flux density .",
    "the x - ray agn fractions we find are somewhat higher than that of treister et al .",
    "while the cause of this offset is not entirely clear , it is likely to be due at least in part to cosmic variance , as their 24  sample was drawn from goods - n , and ours from goods - s . once again , the vast majority of x - ray non - detected agn at all flux densities lie at @xmath128 , the mean redshift of the sources selected via the plg , daddi et al .",

    "the main conclusions of this paper are as follows :    * the majority of non - power - law irac color - selected agn candidates have ir colors consistent with those of redshift - appropriate star - forming templates . in comparison , the majority of plg  agn candidates lie outside of the star - forming contours .",
    "plg selection recovers the majority of high - quality agn candidates . * the reliability of agn irac color - color selection improves with increasing flux as high - redshift star - forming galaxies fall out of the sample .",

    "a comparison of the 24  to 3.6  colors of the x - ray non - detected plgs  to those of agn and star - forming templates suggests that the x - ray non - detected plgs , like their x - ray ",

    "because this method relies on star - forming templates , however , we do not expect it to provide equally reliable photometric redshifts for galaxies in which the stellar features are dominated by emission from an agn .",
    "our second method is based on the chi - squared minimization routine hyperz ( bolzonella , miralles , & pell 2000 ) . with a suite of normal star - forming , lirg / ulirg , _ and _ agn templates , we can better account for the range of sources expected in our 24  selected sample , albeit with a smaller template library . to create this library , we started with a sample of 10 star - forming templates and 8 agn templates from silva et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and polletta et al .",
    "the polletta et al .",
    "agn templates cover a range of intrinsic obscurations ( type 1 and type 2 ) and luminosities ( sey / qso ) .",
    "we then supplemented this sample with 10 empirical star - forming lirg and ulirg templates .",
    "the full template sample is listed in table 1 .",
    "the lirg and ulirg templates , described in detail in rieke et al .",
    "( 2008 , in prep . ) , significantly improve upon previous semi - empirical templates by constraining the seds between 1 and 6  with 2mass and irac photometry and by basing the seds from 5 to 35  on irs spectra .",
    "using this template library , we ran hyperz on all robust optical  mir data for the ir - normal and color - selected galaxies .",
    "for the plgs , we removed all photometry longward of 3.6  ( irac channel 1 ) . including the full _ spitzer _",
    "photometry for plgsprovided little or no additional constraint on potential redshifts , and limited severely the seds for which a good fit could be found .",

    "for the ir - normal galaxies , we assume the calzetti ( 2000 ) extinction curve , as this curve was modeled to represent the extinction properties of starburst galaxies . to prevent unrealistic redshift solutions",
    ", we applied the redshift- and model - dependent absolute magnitude cuts of polletta et al .",
    "finally , to increase the weight of the irac photometry , which solely defines the red slope of the stellar bump , we set the errors on the irac photometry to the measurement errors , as opposed to the total photometric errors .",
    "this procedure is acceptable because many types of photometric error will have similar effects on the four irac bands , so we are making use of the overall internal consistency expected for the data .    to improve the likelihood of obtaining a good fit for each source",
    ", we then varied a number of these assumptions , and examined by eye the resulting fits to choose the most convincing redshift solution .",
    "this visual inspection is an important characteristic of our work , and was made possible by the relatively small number of sources in our sample .",
    "first , each plg  and color - selected galaxy was fit by both the smc and calzetti extinction laws .",
    "in most cases , the resulting redshift fits and solutions varied only slightly ( in which case we chose the smc - derived fit ) , but for some galaxies , one of the two extinction laws provided a clearly superior fit as determined by a visual inspection .",
    "second , if the absolute magnitude of the resulting best - fit template did not meet the redshift - dependent absolute magnitude cut of polletta et al .",

    "third , we allowed the irac errors to increase to their total estimated values by adding a 10% error to the flux ; in only 4 cases did this lead to a better fit . finally , for the plgs , we explored fits that did not include the 3.6  irac channel ; only 2 sources benefited from this change .",
    "the final step in our redshift estimation was an independent review of the redshifts by two authors . by examining by eye the resulting redshift fits , we chose for each plg  and color - selected galaxy the best hyperz redshift .",
    "we then compared this to the redshift fit from the prez - gonzlez et al .",

    "we do , however , remove unconvincing redshift fits , and substitute a solid hyperz redshift if available .",
    "for all sources , we only assign a photometric redshift if a convincing fit exists .",
    "we rejected 76 sources with poor data or other problems that compromise our redshift determination .",
    "the photometric redshifts classified as being of high quality are summarized in table 1 and shown in figure 1 .",
    "the lowest redshift bin contains no plgsand 2 color - selected galaxies , both of which are detected in the x - ray , but with low observed x - ray luminosities of log  @xmath77(ergs  s@xmath10)@xmath236 and log  @xmath75(ergs  s@xmath10)@xmath237 , indicative of powerful starbursts or very low - luminosity agn .",

    "only 41% and 25% are detected in the x - ray , respectively , compared to 100% of the plgs .",
    "the average observed 0.5 - 8 kev x - ray luminosity of the x - ray  detected color - selected galaxies , log  @xmath77(ergs  s@xmath10)@xmath239 , is consistent with agn activity , but is an order of magnitude less than that of the plgs  in this redshift bin , log  @xmath75(ergs  s@xmath10)@xmath96 .",
    "this is not surprising , as power - law selection preferentially identifies the most luminous agn where the emission from the central engine is able to overpower that of the host galaxy ( donley et al .",
    "the agn that lie amongst the color - selected sample clearly represent a less luminous agn population than those selected via the plg  criteria .",
    "furthermore , of the 27 lacy - selected ( and 4 stern - selected ) galaxies , only 11 ( 2 ) lie outside the @xmath98 star - forming contours in their respective color - space , with the number dropping to 3 and 1 ( 2 and 0 ) at @xmath79 and @xmath141 .",
    "this suggests that the majority of the color - selected sources in this redshift bin have infrared colors indicative of ir - normal galaxies . while all of the plgs  lie outside even the @xmath141 contours in the lacy color - space , they lie inside the contours in stern - space , due primarily to the sdm template of polletta et al .",

    "whose colors overlap with this template , both have spectroscopic redshifts of @xmath242 , and would therefore be safe if we considered smaller redshift bins . removing this template",
    ", however , would have no effect on the number of lacy or stern - selected sources that lie outside the @xmath98 contours .",
    "we find a higher proportion of secure color - selected galaxies in the @xmath243 bin , with 10/12 of the lacy - selected sources and 6/13 of the stern - selected sources lying outside the @xmath98 star - forming contours .",
    "this is not surprising , as it is at @xmath244 that the star - forming contours are best separated from the agn selection region .",
    "if we extend our test to @xmath79 , however , the numbers drop significantly , to 5/12 and 1/13 .",
    "the majority of the stern - selected galaxies in this redshift bin fill the lower - left corner of the agn selection region , the region populated by the stern - only sources whose lacy colors place them in the star - forming locus of color - space .",
    "these star - forming galaxies are likely responsible for the fact that this is the only redshift bin in which the stern - selected sources outnumber the lacy - selected sources .",
    "of the 5 plgs  in this redshift bin , all lie outside the @xmath163 star - forming contours in both lacy and stern color - space , and while only 3 lie outside of the @xmath79 contours in stern color - space , all lie outside of the @xmath79 and @xmath141 colors in lacy color - space .",
    "the number of color - selected galaxies rises significantly in the @xmath245 redshift bin .",
    "the fraction of potential ir - selected agn , however , is by far the lowest at these redshifts , with only 6/38 lacy - selected sources and 3/31 stern - selected sources falling outside the @xmath98 star - forming contours .",
    "in addition , only 3/38 lacy sources and 4/31 stern sources have x - ray counterparts , further suggesting that nearly all of the color - selected sources at this redshift are star - forming galaxies , and not agn .",
    "in contrast , the 2 plgs  found in this redshift bin fall outside of the @xmath98 contours in both the lacy and stern plots , and both are detected in the x - ray .",
    "the largest number of lacy - selected sources , 77 , is found in the @xmath246 bin .",
    "in addition , an extraordinarily high fraction , 50/77 , lie outside of the @xmath98 star - forming contours , a surprising fact given the x - ray detection fraction of only 9% .",
    "have we discovered a significant population of @xmath128 obscured agn similar to those claimed by daddi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , or is there another explanation for this population ?    the agn contours ( shown in green ) provide a better match to the ir colors of these color - selected galaxies than do the star - forming templates ( shown in blue ) . at this redshift , the primary difference between the irac regions of the star - forming and the low - luminosity agn templates is the strength of the co index , which is stronger in the star - forming galaxies than in the agn .",
    "the mips  selected sources therefore may have smaller co indices than those of our local templates .",
    "one explanation for this offset is that an underlying agn continuum has diluted this feature . a lower co index , however ,",
    "could also be attributed to evolution in the metallicity of the lirgs / ulirgs . at 1/3 solar metallicity",
    ", the co index drops by 4 - 6 percentage points ( mcgregor 1987 ) , causing the contours to shift upwards in lacy color space by @xmath247 . while this lessens this offset between the colors of star - forming contours and the observed galaxies , it can not fully account for the observed discrepancy .",
    "thus , if a change in the co index is invoked for the offset , it is likely that agn continua are also present .",
    "however , other possible explanations exist .",
    "if we incorporate into the contours a 10% error in ( 1+z ) ( recall that the measured @xmath56 for our photometric redshift fits was 0.15 and that 11% of the sources in our spectroscopic redshift sample have photometric errors @xmath248 ) the resulting contours are far - better matched to the ir - colors of the color - selected galaxies . of the lacy- and stern - selected galaxies ,",
    "only 17% and 9% now lie outside of the @xmath98 contours , with the numbers dropping to 8% and 0% at @xmath79 and 4% and 0% at @xmath141 , respectively .",
    "the templates with which the photometric redshifts were best fit can provide further insight into the sources in this redshift bin . of the 90 non - plgs  in the @xmath2 bin , 75 ( 86% )",
    "are best fit by a star - forming ulirg template , 9 ( 10% ) are best fit by a ulirg / hidden agn template , 1 ( 1% ) is best - fit by a type 2 agn template , and 1 ( 1% ) is best fit by a type 1 agn template .",
    "in contrast , all of the plgs  in this redshift range are best - fit by a type 2 agn template .",
    "therefore , while we can not rule out the possibility that we have detected a sample of high - redshift , heavily obscured agn , the extremely low x - ray detection fraction of 9% , the much improved fit of the contours for which 10% errors in the photometric redshifts were included , and the overwhelming fraction of sources for which a purely star - forming ulirg provided the best fit to the sed suggest that it is more likely that the vast majority of color - selected galaxies in this redshift bin are star - forming galaxies , not agn .",
    "the number of color - selected galaxies in the remaining two redshift bins is relatively low : 18 lacy - selected sources and 5 stern selected sources . of these , a large fraction ( 61% and 80% , respectively ) lie outside of the star - forming contours , which cover a comparatively small portion of the color - space . at @xmath79 and @xmath141 ,",
    "the fractions drop to 39% and 11% ( lacy ) and 20% and 0% ( stern ) . at these redshifts , the x - ray detection fractions of both the color - selected sources and the plgs  are low : 17% for the lacy sources , 40% for the stern sources , and 23% for the plgs . at @xmath250 , an unobscured agn with @xmath251",
    "requires a rest - frame 0.5 - 8 kev luminosity of log  @xmath77(ergs  s@xmath10)@xmath252 to meet the flux limit within 1@xmath253 of the cdf - s aimpoint .",
    "at @xmath254 , the required value rises to log  @xmath75(ergs  s@xmath10)@xmath239 , suggesting that if these sources are agn , they must have low luminosities , or high obscuring columns .      not all sources in our sample have redshift estimates .",
    "the redshift completeness for the lacy and stern color - selected samples is high ( 93% and 90% , respectively ) , but we have high - quality redshifts for only 49% of the plgs .",
    "the difficulty in fitting redshifts to these sources stems largely from their faint fluxes : the power - law ( color - selected ) galaxies without redshifts are significantly fainter , @xmath256 ( @xmath257 ) , than those with redshift estimates , @xmath258 ( @xmath259 ) , suggesting that these sources may preferentially lie at high redshift .",
    "the last panels of figures 5 and 6 show the irac colors of sources without redshift estimates .",
    "overplotted are the star - forming contours for @xmath83 . of the sources without redshifts , all but 1 lie inside the lacy selection region and all but 9 lie inside the stern selection region .",
    "this is not surprising , as sources with non - stellar continua are the hardest sources to fit .",
