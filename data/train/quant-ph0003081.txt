    "quantum mechanics often works with the exactly solvable simplified models . for the precise fits of data or for some more subtle quantitative analyses , unfortunately , the number of solvable models is too limited . in @xmath2 dimensions ,",

    "a new way out of this deadlock emerges within the framework of the alternative , so called  @xmath4 symmetric \" quantum mechanics . with its _ complex _ hamiltonians @xmath5 breaking both the parity @xmath6 and the time - reflection symmetry @xmath7 and commuting only with their product @xmath8 , this formalism was proposed by bessis @xcite and by bender et al @xcite as a possible way towards weakening of the standard requirements of hermiticity .",
    "several new exactly solvable @xmath4 symmetric models have been proposed recently @xcite .",
    "this is a promising development with possible applications ranging from field theories @xcite to supersymmetric models @xcite and from quasi - classical methods @xcite to perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "even the solvable harmonic oscillator itself acquires a richer spectrum after its consequent @xmath4 symmetric regularization in @xmath2 dimensions @xcite .",
    "the detailed structure of spectrum of this prominent example does not in fact offer any really serious surprise .",
    "a manifest violation of the parity @xmath6 is compensated by an emergence of the so called quasi - parity @xmath9 tractable as a signature of two equidistant subspectra .",
    "the new quantum number @xmath10 degenerates back to the eigenvalue of parity after a return to the standard hermitean and one - dimensional oscillator .",
    "no immediate surprise emerges also for the quartic anharmonic oscillator @xcite .",
    "the situation only becomes less clear after one moves towards the asymptotically vanishing models .",
    "they exhibit several counterintuitive properties and open new mathematical challenges @xcite .",
    "in particular , the popular coulomb potential did not not even seem particularly suitable for any immediate @xmath4 symmetric regularization @xcite .",
    "a psychological barrier has been created by the numerical and semiclassical studies of the general power - law forces @xmath11 .",
    "they may be well defined everywhere near the harmonic exponents @xmath12 , @xmath13 etc @xcite . at the same time",
    ", the related analyses hinted that it is apparently difficult to move beyond the herbst s singularity located at @xmath14 @xcite .    in",
    "what follows , we intend to employ a slightly different strategy and try to study the coulomb problem directly , via its well known correspondence to the harmonic oscillator .",
    "this correspondence is based on an elementary change of variables .",
    "its background dates back to the nineteenth century mathematics and , in particular , to the work of liouville @xcite .",
    "the newton s monograph @xcite cites also fivel @xcite as a newer source of the idea . in the contemporary literature ( cf .",
    ", e.g. , @xcite for further references ) people usually speak about the kustaanheimo - steifel ( ks ) transformation @xcite . in all the implementations of this idea the parameters appearing in the coulombic and oscillator problems are interrelated of course .",
    "details will be mentioned below .",
    "preliminarily , let us only warn the reader that all the ks - type mappings can also change the dimensions and angular momenta and that the energies of one problem are related to the coupling constants of the other one and vice versa .",
    "within the `` normal '' quantum mechanics , all this has already been thoroughly discussed elsewhere : in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath15 and in ref .",
    "@xcite for the continuous transformation between coulomb problems and harmonic oscillators in various dimensions .",
    "the change - of - variable approach to the coulombic bound - state problem enables us to start directly from the harmonic oscillator potential @xmath16 or , in the present less traditional context , from its @xmath4 symmetric radial schrdinger equation ( r ) = ^2 ( r ) [ seor ] of ref .",
    "@xcite , using the complex coordinate @xmath17 with real @xmath18 and with , say , positive @xmath19 .",
    "this means that the integration path has been shifted down from the position where it would cross the strong centrifugal singularity .",
    "such a regularization preserves the asymptotic decrease of the normalizable solutions . only in the limit @xmath20 and beyond the trivial one - dimensional case one has to omit all the so called irregular solutions @xcite defined by their  physically unnacceptable \" @xmath21 behaviour near the origin .    within the framework of the general liouville method the change of variables mediates a transition to the different potential @xmath22 .",
    "it is easy to show that once we forget about boundary conditions one merely has to demand the existence of an invertible function @xmath23 and its few derivatives @xmath24 .",
    "then , the explicit correspondence between the two bound state problems may be _ explicitly _ given by the elementary formulae . from our original eq .",
    "( [ seor ] ) ( i.e. , in our case , harmonic oscillator ) one obtains the new ( i.e. , in our case , coulombic ) schrdinger equation ( t ) = e ( t ) [ se ] with the new wave functions ( t)= / [ trenky ] and with the new interaction and the new energies @xcite , + v(t)-e=^2 \\ { + w[r(t)]-^2 } + ^2 - .",
    "thus , it only remains for us to re - analyse the boundary conditions .",
    "without any serious formal difficulties let us extend the scope of the present considerations to all the singular forces @xmath25 and and/or @xmath26 . both these central forces may act in the respective @xmath27 and @xmath2 dimensions .",

    "such a flexible transfer of the excitation - dependence throws also a new light on the complexified ks transformation itself .",
    "let us return in more detail to the @xmath65dependence of our energies ( [ energs ] ) .",
    "firstly , we notice their power - law dependence on @xmath62 and @xmath66 ( with exponent = -2 ) as somewhat similar to the spectra in @xmath4 symmetric oscillator well @xcite ( with exponent = + 1 ) and in the morse potential of ref .",
    "@xcite ( with exponent = + 2 ) .    in the present case ,",
    "obviously , we have to distinguish between the two separate families @xmath67 with @xmath68 ( cf .",
    "figure 1 ) and @xmath69 ( cf . figure 2 ) .",
    "the latter set is , up to its sign , analogous to the ordinary coulombic spectrum .",
    "by far not so the former one .",
    "its energies enrich and dominate the spectrum . the @xmath70th energy",
    " flies away \" and disappears from the spectrum at @xmath71 .",
    "moreover , at all the positive integers and half - integers @xmath66 one encounters the _ unavoided _",
    "level crossings .",
    "in contrast to the harmonic case , they appear at _ both _ the opposite and identical ( viz . , positive ) quasiparities @xmath10 .",
    "the former case takes place at @xmath72 while in the latter case we must fulfill the condition @xmath73 .",
    "a sample of this phenomenon is given in figure 3 .",
    "formally the unavoided crossings generate certain identities which connect different laguerre polynomials ( cf . their sample in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in applications ,",
    "these  critical \" cases are not exceptional at all . for @xmath74 forces without a spike ,",
    "the critical integer or half - integer coordinates @xmath75 correspond _ precisely _ to the physical ( namely , integer ) dimensions @xmath2 and partial waves @xmath76 .    in the conclusion ,",
    "let us not forget about many open questions .",
    "_ pars pro toto _ , one could mention a not yet clear possibility of re - interpretation of our bound states , say , in the limit @xmath77 , i.e. , beyond the mathematical and apparently natural boundaries of our present approach .",
    "moreover , we must keep in mind that via our complexification of the coordinates we of course broke their immediate connection to any standard @xmath78dimensional problem . in this sense ,",
    "our @xmath74 and @xmath79 hamiltonians differ just in an inessential way .",
    "one could even prefer the latter , kratzer - like option as a model which is formally simpler , due to the generic absence of the puzzling unavoided crossings . at @xmath80",
    "the structure of the spectrum of our present coulomb model becomes also richer and , in this sense , more interesting .",
