    "granules with highest pressure grow and push matter against neighboring granules , that then shrink and disappear . ascending flow increases pressure in center of granule and upflowing fluids decelerates motion .",

    "some ones travel small distance from surface and become weak enough to be broken up by the surrounding fluid motion .",
    "other ones conserve motion with high velocity and move on distance about 6 mm .",
    "we observe that different nature such behavior is due to initial condition of formation downdrafts . in place of confluence of convective cells to one point more energy is released .    in region from 5 mm to 8 mm of depth",
