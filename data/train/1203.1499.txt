    "this paper is concerned with @xmath0 theory for higher - order elliptic systems in divergence form with _",
    "conormal _ derivative boundary conditions .",
    "our focus is to seek minimal regularity assumptions on the leading coefficients of elliptic systems defined on regular and irregular domains .",
    "the paper is a continuation of @xcite , where the authors considered higher - order systems in the whole space and on domains with _ dirichlet _ boundary conditions .",
    "there is a vast literature on @xmath0 theory for second - order and higher - order elliptic and parabolic equations / systems with _ constant _ or _ uniformly continuous _ coefficients .",
    "we refer the reader to the classical work @xcite .",
    "concerning possibly discontinuous coefficients , a notable class is the set of bounded functions with vanishing mean oscillations ( vmo ) .",
    "this class of coefficients was firstly introduced in @xcite in the case of second - order non - divergence form elliptic equations , and further considered by a number of authors in various contexts , including higher - order equations and systems ; see , for instance , @xcite .",
    "recently , in @xcite the authors studied the _",
    "problem for higher - order elliptic and parabolic systems with possibly measurable coefficients . in @xcite",
    ", we established the @xmath0-solvability of both divergence and non - divergence form systems with coefficients ( called @xmath1 coefficients in @xcite ) having locally small mean oscillations with respect to the spatial variables , and measurable in the time variable in the parabolic case . while in @xcite , divergence form elliptic and parabolic systems of arbitrary order are considered in the whole space , on a half space , and on reifenberg flat domains , with _",
    "variably partially bmo coefficients_. this class of coefficients was introduced in @xcite in the context of second - order non - divergence form elliptic equations in the whole space , and naturally appears in the homogenization of layered materials ; see , for instance , @xcite .",
    "it was later considered by the authors of the present article in @xcite and by byun and wang in @xcite .",
    "loosely speaking , on each cylinder ( or ball in the elliptic case ) , the coefficients are allowed to be merely measurable in one spatial direction called the _ measurable direction _ , which may vary for different cylinders .",
    "it is also assumed that the coefficients have small mean oscillations in the orthogonal directions , and near the boundary the measurable direction is sufficiently close to the `` normal '' direction of the boundary .",
    "note that the boundary of a reifenberg flat domain is locally trapped in thin discs , which allows the boundary to have a fractal structure ; cf . .",
    "thus the normal direction of the boundary may not be well defined for reifenberg flat domains , so instead we take the normal direction of the top surface of these thin discs .",
    "the proofs in @xcite are in the spirit of @xcite by n. v. krylov , in which the author gave a unified approach of @xmath0 estimates for both divergence and non - divergence second - order elliptic and parabolic equations in the whole space with @xmath1 coefficients .",
    "one of the crucial steps in @xcite is to establish certain interior _ mean oscillation estimates _ of solutions to equations with `` simple '' coefficients , which are measurable functions of the time variable only . then the estimates for equations with @xmath1 coefficients follow from the mean oscillation estimates combined with a perturbation argument . in this connection",
    ", we point out that in @xcite a great deal of efforts were made to derive boundary and interior mean oscillation estimates for solutions to higher - order systems . for systems in reifenberg flat domains",
    ", we also used an idea in @xcite .    in this paper , we study a _",
    "conormal _ derivative problem for elliptic operators in divergence form of order @xmath2 : @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are @xmath6-dimensional multi - indices , @xmath7_{i , j=1}^n$ ] are @xmath8 complex matrix - valued functions , and @xmath9 is a complex vector - valued function . for @xmath10 , we use the notation @xmath11 . all the coefficients are assumed to be bounded and measurable , and @xmath12 is uniformly elliptic ; cf . .",
    "consider the following elliptic system @xmath13 on a domain @xmath14 in @xmath15 , where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is a constant .",
    "a function @xmath19 is said to be a weak solution to on @xmath14 with the conormal derivative boundary condition associated with @xmath20 ( on @xmath21 ) if @xmath22 for any test function @xmath23 , where @xmath24 .",
    "we emphasize that the phrase `` associated with @xmath20 '' is appended after `` the conormal derivative boundary condition '' because for different representations of the right - hand side of , even if they are pointwise equal , the weak formulation could still be different .",
    "in the sequel , we omit this phrase when there is no confusion .",
    "we note that the equation above can also be understood as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a given vector - valued bounded linear functional on @xmath27 .",
    "the main objective of the paper is to show the unique @xmath28-solvability of on a half space or on a possibly unbounded reifenberg domain with the same regularity conditions on the leading coefficients , that is , _",
    "variably partially bmo coefficients _ , as those in @xcite .",
    "see section [ sec082001 ] for the precise statements of the assumptions and main results .",
    "notably , our results are new even for second - order scalar equations . in the literature , an @xmath0 estimate for the conormal derivative problem can be found in @xcite , where the authors consider second - order divergence elliptic equations without lower - order terms and with coefficients small bmo with respect to all variables on bounded reifenberg domains .",
    "the proof in @xcite contains a compactness argument , which does not apply to equations with coefficients measurable in some direction discussed in the current paper . for other results about the conormal derivative problem",
    ", we refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we prove the main theorems by following the strategy in @xcite .",
    "first , for systems with homogeneous right - hand side and coefficients measurable in one direction , we estimate the hlder norm of certain linear combinations of @xmath29 in the interior of the domain , as well as near the boundary if the boundary is flat and perpendicular to the measurable direction . then by using the hlder estimates",
    ", we proceed to establish mean oscillation estimates of solutions to elliptic systems . as is expected",
    ", the obstruction is in the boundary mean oscillation estimates , to which we give a more detailed account .",
    "note that when obtaining mean oscillation estimates of solutions , even in the half space case we do not require the measurable direction to be exactly perpendicular to the boundary , but allow it to be sufficiently close to the normal direction .",
    "for the dirichlet problem in @xcite , we used a delicate cut - off argument together with a generalized hardy s inequality .",
    "however , this method no longer works for the conormal derivative problem as solutions do not vanish on the boundary .",
    "the key observation in this paper is lemma [ lem4.2 ] which shows that if one modifies the right - hand side a little bit , then the function @xmath9 itself still satisfies the system with the conormal derivative boundary condition on a subdomain with a flat boundary perpendicular to the measurable direction .",
    "this argument is also readily adapted to elliptic systems on reifenberg flat domains with variably partially bmo coefficients .",
    "the corresponding parabolic problem , however , seems to be still out of reach by the argument mentioned above .",
    "in fact , in the modified equation in lemma [ lem4.2 ] there would be an extra term involving @xmath30 on the right - hand side . at the time of this writing , it is not clear to us how to estimate this term .    the remaining part of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we state the main theorems in the next section .",
    "section [ sec_aux ] contains some auxiliary results including @xmath31-estimates , interior and boundary hlder estimates , and approximations of reifenberg domains . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we establish the interior and boundary mean oscillation estimates and then prove the solvability of systems on a half space .",
