    "there has been intense recent speculation on the form of the qcd phase diagram at small temperature @xmath1 but large baryon chemical potential @xmath2 .",
    "the conventional view is that for sufficiently large @xmath2 , chiral symmetry is spontaneously restored , resulting in a degenerate system of relativistic quarks known as quark matter , with fermi energy @xmath3 .",
    "since the @xmath4 interaction can be attractive due to gluon exchange @xcite and/or instanton effects @xcite , however , this simple picture may have a bcs instability with respect to condensation of diquark pairs at the fermi surface , resulting in a color superconducting ground state @xcite , and the formation of an energy gap @xmath5 to the first excited state of the system ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : disperse ] ) .",
    "model calculations @xcite suggest that @xmath6 could be as large as 100 mev , comparable with the constituent quark scale .",
    "it is clearly desirable to examine the various scenarios in non - perturbative lattice qcd simulations , where systematic control is at least in principle possible .",
    "unfortunately , this has so far proved impracticable because the euclidean functional measure is no longer positive definite for @xmath7 , rendering the usual importance sampling methods ineffective .",
    "there are , however , simpler four - fermion models where monte carlo methods can be applied and yield a plausible description of degenerate matter @xcite . in this talk i describe numerical studies of the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model in 2 + 1 spacetime dimensions ; the lagrangian in continuum notation reads @xmath8.\\ ] ] the model in 3 + 1@xmath9 has a long history as an effective description of strong interaction physics @xcite . for coupling @xmath10 stronger than some critical @xmath11 the su(2)@xmath12su(2)@xmath13u(1)@xmath14 global symmetry present for quark mass @xmath15 spontaneously breaks to su(2)@xmath16u(1)@xmath14 , accompanied by the generation of a constituent quark mass @xmath17 .",
    "the behaviour in 2 + 1@xmath9 has the same pattern , except that this time there is an interacting continuum limit at @xmath18 , @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "once a chemical potential is introduced , for low @xmath1 an expansion in the inverse number of flavors @xmath20 predicts @xmath21 to remain roughly unchanged out to a critical @xmath22 , whereupon chiral symmetry is abruptly restored in a strong first - order transition @xcite . at the same point the baryon density @xmath23 rises from zero to a non - zero @xmath24 ,",
    "consistent with filling a two - dimensional fermi ball of radius @xmath2 .",
    "this is confirmed by lattice simulations @xcite ; in particular , unlike other simulations with a real measure , there is a clear separation of scales between @xmath25 and @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the question to consider is whether for @xmath27 the baryon number u(1)@xmath14 symmetry is spontaneously broken by a diquark condensate @xmath28 . since the njl model is not a gauge theory , this leads not to superconductivity but to the associated phenomenon of _",
    "superfluidity_. in fact , numerical studies @xcite reveal that the preferred channel for pairing in this regime is ( in the notation of staggered fermions ) via the scalar su(2)@xmath12su(2)@xmath29 singlet @xmath30 . to find unambiguous evidence for bcs condensation on a finite system , however , the correct procedure @xcite is to add to @xmath31 a diquark source term @xmath32 it is then possible to measure the diquark condensate using methods similar to those used in lattice studies of chiral symmetry breaking : @xmath33 together with the associated susceptibilities @xmath34 in a conventional bcs condensation the + describes a `` higgs '' mode while the  is a `` goldstone '' , which is constrained by a ward identity : @xmath35    in collaboration with biagio lucini and susan morrison i have simulated a lattice njl model including the source term ( [ eq : source ] ) @xcite .",
    "our parameter choice yields a @xmath36 .",
    "[ fig : lnln ] plots @xmath37 extrapolated to the zero temperature @xmath38 limit ; for @xmath39 the data support a linear relation between @xmath37 and @xmath40 , consistent with a u(1)@xmath14-symmetric ground state . for @xmath27 by contrast , the data suggest @xmath41 with @xmath42 falling in the range 0.2 - 0.3 for the @xmath2 values studied .",
    "evidence for power law behaviour is reinforced by considering the susceptibility ratio @xmath43 : eqns .",
    "( [ eq : ward ] ) and ( [ eq : power ] ) together imply that this ratio should take the constant value @xmath44 in the high density phase , and the plateaux of fig .",
    "[ fig : r ] for @xmath45 support this .",
    "the simulation data suggest that the high density phase @xmath27 is _ critical _ , characterised by continuously varying exponents @xmath46 and @xmath47 defined via @xmath48 and is thus qualitatively similar to the low-@xmath1 phase of the @xmath0 xy model . if we write @xmath49 , then long range order is washed out by ir fluctuations of @xmath50 , but long - range phase coherence persists via ( [ eq : phase ] ) .",
    "this is precisely what gives rise to persistent currents and hence superfluidity in @xmath0 systems .",
    "the supercurrent @xmath51 is related to @xmath4 via @xmath52 the only way to change the circulation @xmath53 around a periodic volume is to create a vortex  anti - vortex in the @xmath54 configuration and translate one of the pair around the universe in the perpendicular direction until they reannihilate , in so doing incrementing the quantised @xmath55 by @xmath56 .",
    "the energy needed increases logarithmically with @xmath57 , implying that the circulation is metastable @xcite .",
    "the conclusions of the previous section beg the question of why the observed @xmath59  5 is not consistent with the @xmath0 xy value @xmath60 , in contrast to a recent study of superfluidity in the attractive hubbard model @xcite .",
    "further insight is gained from studying the spin-@xmath58 sector via the fermion propagator , which for @xmath61 contains both normal @xmath62 and anomalous @xmath63 components . to probe the fermi surface , data at non - zero momentum",
    "@xmath64 are needed . in the normal sector a sharp transition between forwards @xmath65 and backwards @xmath66 propagation at a rather well - defined momentum @xmath67 on a @xmath68 system at @xmath69 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : amplitudes ] .",
    "we interpret this as a crossover between hole and particle excitations at the fermi surface .",
    "the anomalous propagators signifying particle - hole mixing peak at the same momentum , but appear to vanish as @xmath70 .    the results for the mass gap are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eofk ] , with hole energies plotted as negative .",
    "the resulting curve is the _ quasiparticle dispersion relation _ ; its detailed form indicates a fermi momentum @xmath71 slightly less than @xmath2 and a fermi velocity @xmath72 , somewhat less than the speed of light .",
    "both results differ from the corresponding free - field values , but are consistent with a relativistic normal fermi liquid with repulsive interaction between quasiparticles with parallel momenta @xcite .",
    "most importantly , there is no signal for a gap @xmath5 .",
    "the origin of the non - standard critical behaviour may therefore be attributed to massless fermions ; the presence of a fermi surface leads to a new @xmath0 universality class .",
    "this situation should be contrasted with dimensional reduction in systems with @xmath73 @xcite ; because the fermi degrees of freedom in this case acquire masses @xmath74 and decouple , the universality class is that of the spin model with the corresponding global symmetry .",
    "both @xmath75 and @xmath6 vanish in the limit @xmath70 implying that the conventional bcs description appropriate for , say , superfluid @xmath76he , does not apply in this case . the most economic hypothesis explaining the results of figs .",
    "2  5 is that the njl@xmath77 model in its high density phase describes a gapless relativistic system with superfluidity realised in the way first suggested by kosterlitz and thouless for thin films of @xmath78he .",
    "further numerical confirmation for this picture would come from observation of current quantisation in the presence of a source @xmath79 with built - in winding number .",
    "the more urgent problem , however , is to extend the calculations to njl@xmath80 and test the exciting scenarios predicted in @xcite beyond the self - consistent approximation",
