    "the anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) are a group of about six young , isolated neutron stars showing pulsations with periods of the order 10s , whose high - energy luminosity vastly exceeds what is available in rotational energy losses .",
    "they are modeled as _ magnetars _ , their energetics dominated by energy released from a decaying super - strong magnetic field , @xmath1 g externally .",
    "see woods & thompson ( 2004 ) for a summary of current observations and their interpretation in the context of the magnetar model .    since their discovery",
    ", the x - ray spectra of the axps have been fitted with simple continuum models , most commonly the sum of a black body , representing the peak of the spectrum around a few kev , and a power law to account for the emission at higher energies .",
    "the overall spectra are relatively soft , as indicated by high power - law indices . in the fitting process",
    ", the interstellar extinction is estimated as well , by including a multiplicative term to take account of the absorption of all elements , parameterized by the hydrogen column density , .    while these smooth continuum spectral models reproduce the spectra of all axp well in the range observed by satellites such as _ chandra _ , _ xmm _ and _ asca _ ( roughly 0.5 to 10kev ) , their extrapolation fails at both higher and lower energies . at energies from tens of kev to @xmath2mev , kuiper et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and den hartog ( 2006 ) found from rxte / hexe and integral observations that much harder power - law components are present , which dominate the total energetics . in the optical and infrared , the first detections of axps made by hulleman et al .",
    "( 2000 , 2001 ) already showed that while the optical and infrared emission is only a tiny part of the energy budget , it is well below ( by orders of magnitude ) the extrapolation of the x - ray spectra dominated by the power law , yet well above the extrapolation of just a blackbody component .",
    "thus , the optical and infrared emission also appears to require a separate emission component .",
    "more recently , the situation was complicated even further , when wang et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found from mid - infrared observations from _",
    "spitzer _ that at least one of the axps ( 4u 0142@xmath361 ) shows evidence of a circumstellar dusty disc .",
    "the above discrepancies led us to wonder whether the measurements of interstellar extinction were reliable .",
    "these are particularly sensitive to the the low - energy ( @xmath4ev ) part of the spectra ( where the absorption is highest ) , and one would expect that they would depend strongly on the assumed model for the intrinsic emission . for instance , the above - mentioned model consisting of a black - body and a power - law component rises towards lower energies , while a model of , say , two black - body components , would turn over . thus , to match a given observation , the former would require a larger column density than the latter .    from previous studies ( see table  [ nhlit ] ) , it is indeed clear that the inferred column density  depends strongly on the assumed intrinsic model , with the differences in  for different models fitted to the same spectrum far exceeding the statistical uncertainty obtained for any given one . clearly , without knowing the intrinsic shape of the spectrum , one can not measure the extinction accurately , and , conversely , without knowing the extinction independently , one can obtain only little information about the true intrinsic spectrum .    another clue that the extinction is not estimated correctly , and hence that the models used for the intrinsic spectrum are incorrect , comes from variability studies .",
    "axp spectra have been seen to vary both from one epoch to another , and between phase bins ( e.g. , woods et al.2004 ; rea et al .  2005 ) , and , generally , different values of  are found for these different spectra ( see table  [ nhlit ] ) .",
    "although an intrinsic , variable contribution to the extinction is not impossible in light of the discovery of a possible debris disk around 4u  0142 + 61 ( wang et al .",
    "2006 ) , it seems unlikely , especially on the time - scale of seconds .",
    "indeed , discrepancies in fitted parameters obtained from spectra taken with different instruments , which are often blamed on poor cross - calibration , could well be purely an artifact of the fitting process , with differences in sensitivities leading to differences in weight as a function of energy , and hence different values for the parameters , including the extinction .",

    "recent physical models , such as those presented by lyutikov & gavriil ( 2006 ) can account for a power - law like high - energy tail , but do not predict a soft part . in these models , the blackbody surface flux is modified by interactions in the outer atmosphere or magnetosphere , for example through the inverse - compton scattering of photons off high - energy particles .",

    "absorption in the interstellar medium of x - ray photons is primarily by the photo - electric capture by electrons in inner shells of metals and helium . since the creation of x - ray absorption models ( morrison & mccammon 1983 ; balucinska - church & mccammon 1992 ) , great advances have been made in our understanding of absorption edge structure and energies ( e.g. , juett et al .  2003 ) , largely driven by the improved resolution and sensitivity of x - ray observatories .",

    "2001 ) , which provide high - resolution spectra in the range 640 .",
    "we found a number of long observations for the four brightest axps ( see table [ datasets ] ; we omitted shorter data sets with few counts ) . for all these",
    ", rgs is used with the same instrumental setup , thus ensuring a fair comparison of the sources .",
    "we also searched for high - resolution spectra taken by _",
    "chandra _ , but found only a few observations . since these did not allow a comparison between sources , we decided not to use these in the present work .",
    "we reduced the raw data ( observation data files or odfs ) with the 20041122 version of the analysis software , xmm - sas , and calibration files .",
    "we used the pipeline products for the data from the european photon imaging cameras , epic ( strder et al .  2001 ;",
    "turner et al.2001 ; these were used only as additional information for the rgs reduction , see below ) .",
    "a light curve was produces with 10-s bins from the epic data .",
    "these showed periods of high background ( _ flaring _ ) , and such periods were excised from the rgs analysis using good time intervals ( gtis ) .",
    "the epic data was also used for source selection , using the automated source detection algorithm .",
    "this only works for imaging modes , but fortunately there are three imaging instruments ( emos1 , emos2 , epn ) , and out of these only one is required .",
    "the co - ordinates of the brightest source were used to extract the rgs spectra .",
    "this eliminates any uncertainties arising from the telescope pointing and bore - sight correction , since the relative alignment of the telescopes and instruments is well known .",
    "final spectra were obtained by subtracting the background and then converting to flux using the xmm - sas task rgsfluxer . for our spectral modeling",
    ", we decided to bin to a relatively low resolution ( 0.1 ) , since the errors associated with bins with few or no counts is uncertain .",
    "we kept a large number of bins in the spectra and response matrix functions until the final fluxing , as recommended in the documentation .",
    "the documentation also states that rgsfluxer fluxes are not recommended for final scientific analysis , but for the relatively low resolution we use and the relatively poor signal - to - noise ratio of our data , the accuracy is ample .    in order to improve the signal - to - noise ratio",
    ", we decided to merge the spectra from different observations of each object into averaged spectra .",
    "here , we must raise two caveats .",
    "the first is that some axps ",
    "1e 1048.1@xmath55937 in particular  are variable , and the spectral shape may be different in each observation .",
    "this , however , should not change our column estimates , since we fit in small spectral regions around each absorption edge .",
    "the second caveat is that the amount of extinction to the continuum source might vary if some of it is intrinsic .",
    "this seems unlikely , but is perhaps not impossible given the discovery by wang et al .",
    "( 2006 ) of a likely debris disc around 4u 0142@xmath361 ( although from broad - band observations there has been no clear evidence for changes in extinction ) .",
    "unfortunately , our individual datasets do not have enough signal to verify this .",
    "finally , we note that for 1e 2259 + 586 there is enhanced background emission due to the supernova remnant surrounding the axp . from the pipeline - produced _ order images _ , however , we find that the spectrum of the central source remains distinguishable and that there are no significant background lines which might contaminate it .",
    "the increased background does , however , lead to poorer signal - to - noise where the axp flux is low .",

    "for the uncertainties on each data point , we use the errors given by rgsfluxer .",
    "there are two possible problems with our fitting method .",
    "first , the uncertainties produced by rgsfluxer are known to be poorly defined for faint sources .",
    "this is because in the high - resolution input spectra ( which are rebinned to our 0.1  bin size in rgsfluxer ) , bins with zero counts are assigned an arbitrary uncertainty of 1 , when the expectation value for the ( faint ) source might genuinely be near zero and hence the associated uncertainty should be smaller as well .",
    "these assigned errors are propagated , and , as a result , the uncertainties on the rebinned fluxes are greatly overestimated , leading to values of reduced @xmath21 far smaller than unity in our fits .",
    "the second possible problem , related to this , is that for these counting data , it would be more appropriate to use the cash statistic rather than @xmath21 , since the probability distribution is poissonian rather than gaussian .",
    "fortunately , in practice these problems are not severe . in a given fitting region",
    ", we find that in our 0.1  bins both the number of counts and the rgsfluxer uncertainty are roughly constant .",
    "thus , even though the given errors are over - estimated , this effect is roughly equal for each point and hence it does not effect the best - fit parameters . furthermore , the bins we use are sufficiently wide that they contain many counts , and hence the assumption of gaussian uncertainties is not so bad .",
    "indeeed , fits made by minimizing the cash statistic led to results very close to those found through the @xmath21 method .",
    "we preferred not to use them generally , however , since with the cash minimization our fitting routine converged much less robustly to the global best fit .    in order to estimate the uncertainties on our measurements ,",
    "we have conducted monte - carlo simulations , in which we produce simulated data sets which we fit in the same manner as the real data .",
    "we employed two different methods for simulating the data . in the first",
    ", we used _ bootstrapping , _",
    "i.e. , we produced simulated data sets with the same number of points as the actual data set by drawing randomly , with replacement , from the actual @xmath22 pairs ( press et al .",
    "in the second method , we simulated data sets based on the best - fit model , adding gaussian noise with a variance equal to the variance of the real data around that model .",
    "both methods gave consistent results after 1000 trials and the spread of results in the one parameter of interest ( the column depth ) , was well - described by a gaussian in every case .",
    "the one - sigma confidence region was taken to be the region enclosed by the 16th and 84th percentile and these are listed in table  [ columns ] .",
    "we note that in some cases , in particular for 1e 1048.1@xmath55937 , the uncertainties even for the best measurements are similar to the measurements themselves , i.e. , the measurements of the indivual columns are not significant . in evaluating this ,",
    "however , one should keep in mind that we know _ a priori _ the locations and shapes of the absorption edges ( from high signal - to - noise measurements of brighter sources ; see  3 ) . being in the galactic plane ,",
    "interstellar extinction is inevitable , and our aim is not to prove the existence of the features , but just to measure the strength of features known to be present .",
    "thus , the measured column densities and associated uncertainties can be used as given , and , in particular , columns from different elements can be combined to give a more significant overall measurement of the extinction .    finally , possible sources of systematic error ought to be mentioned .",
    "first , we have chosen to fit the spectral sections with a power law .",
    "this should not be a large source of additional uncertainty , since our wavelength ranges are so small ",
    "@xmath23  that a power law should be a good approximation for any smooth continuum .",
    "indeed , the fit would be much better constrained if we could use larger wavelength range , but this would require knowledge of what the intrinsic spectrum ought to be .",
    "second , the optical depth in an edge does not in general have the simplistic form given in equation  [ edgeequation ] - the form is different for every ionisation stage of every element . fortunately , the equivalent width of the resulting feature  and thus the total column  is not sensitive to such details , since it depends on the total cross section .",
    "third , the masking of certain wavelengths due to complicated near - edge structure is not necessarily the best approach , but the alternative ",
    "fitting for them  would not be better , since the details of the strengths of the lines depends upon the ( unknown ) ionization balance along the line of sight ; hence , any gain in number of data points included in the fit would be offset by the required additional parameters .",

    "it is clear that the de - extincted spectrum falls with wavelength at longer wavelengths .    in order to see how it might have been possible to infer a rise at longer wavelengths from broad - band data ,",
    "we also show the spectrum de - extincted with @xmath73@xmath74 ( crosses ) , as found by white et al .",
    "( 1996 ) from _ asca _ data , and overdraw their fit of the sum of a power - law and black - body ( upper curve ) and this same model extincted by their value of the hydrogen column ( lower curve ) .",
    "one sees from the figure that , qualitatively , their fit is not unreasonable , so the source has not varied much . looking in detail , however , especially near the oxygen edge , it is clear that their column density is too high , and that the data are inconsistent with a intrinsic spectrum rising at long wavelengths .    in fig  [ deextinct ] , we show the de - extincted spectra derived for all four axps under consideration .",
    "two things are immediately apparent : they are not consistent in shape with one - another , and there is no continuation at low energies of any power - law component representing the emission at @xmath75kev : the photon indices , measured from power - law plus black - body fits , of 2.4 to 4.0 correspond to slopes of @xmath76 , @xmath77 , 0.4 , and 1.0 ( @xmath78 ) , for 1rxs j170849.0@xmath5400910 , 1e 1048.1@xmath55937 , 4u 0142 + 61 , and 1e 2259 + 586 , respectively , while the spectra shown have indices of approximately @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath80 , and 0 ( if the low - energy tail is taken to be a power - law ) .",
    "note that the largest cause of uncertainty in these derived spectra are the uncertainties in the column depths of the individual edges , rather than abundances , detector response or photon statistics .",
    "however , the conclusion that any power - law component at short wavelengths does not continue to long wavelength is robust .",
    "the above result raises a paradox : how can it be that even for the sources other than 4u  0142 + 61 , for which the equivalent hydrogen columns  we determine are consistent with those from power - law plus black - body fits , we do not see the power - law component at long wavelength ? the answer lies in the fact that the low - energy region is actually not reproduced all that well in typical fits to broad - band spectra , but this may not be noticed in the formal @xmath21 since it has relatively few counts and thus carries little weight ( if it is included at all ) . for a good example of this , see fig .  2 in woods at al .",
    "( 2004 ) : below 0.75kev , the data lie systematically @xmath81% above the model ( particularly easy to see in this figure , since it has a panel with the ratio of the data to the model , rather than the usual , less instructive @xmath82 residuals ) . with relatively few counts and larger uncertainties , these points do not affect much the overall @xmath21 , but clearly ( by eye ) they are not well described by the model ( and indeed a bad fit would likely have been found if the data had been binned more heavily ) .    while at low energies there is no evidence of continuations of high - energy power - law components , the spectra also do not decline as fast as would be expected if they were due to a black - body component .",
    "if the thermal emission arises from the neutron - star surface , as seems likely , this might simply reflect a range of temperatures on the surface .",
    "alternatively , it may indicate that more realistic models are required to describe the emission , which also include the effects of magnetic field , interactions with high - energy particles in the magnetosphere , and gravitational light - bending ( the latter particularly important for phase - resolved spectra ) .    finally , looking in detail at the spectra , it appears that for 4u 0142@xmath361 , there is a hint of a feature in the spectrum at about 13.5(this is easier to see in fig .",
    "[ sed ] at around @xmath83hz ) .",
    "one could interpret this either as a broad absorption feature at @xmath84 , or a broad emission feature at @xmath85 .",
    "assuming it is cyclotron absorption ( emission ) , i.e. , @xmath86 , this corresponds to @xmath87 g ( @xmath88 g ) for electrons or @xmath89 g ( @xmath90 g ) for protons .",
    "if the line is red - shifted , the inferred magnetic field strength would increase by a factor @xmath91 , equal to @xmath92 at the surface ( for a neutron star with @xmath93 and @xmath94 km ) .",
    "intriguingly , the value for proton cyclotron lines is close to the magnetic dipole field strength inferred from timing measurements , @xmath95 g ( woods & thompson 2004 ) .",
    "our revised x - ray extinction measurements also allow us to estimate the extinction in the optical and infrared . for this purpose",
    ", we use the relation between the hydrogen column  and visual extinction @xmath96 derived by predehl & schmitt ( 1995 ) : @xmath97mag .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath96 are listed in table  [ reds ] . here , the errors on @xmath96 listed are statistical , i.e. , they do not include the uncertainty in the conversion factor .",
    "the latter uncertainty could be fairly large , both because there is substantial scatter in the measurements used by predehl & schmitt , and because their sample had typically lower values of extinction .",
    "furthermore , their hydrogen column is not measured directly , but is based on x - ray extinction measurements and thus a measure of elements which contribute significantly to absorption in x - rays , i.e. , carbon , oxygen , neon , and magnesium .",
    "the latter should not be a problem in our case , however , since we measure some of the same elements in predehl & schmitt s sensitivity range ( they did not have the spectral resolution to measure individual absorption edges ) , and thus systematic effects in converting to should cancel .",
    "the only caveat is that we used the revised solar abundances of asplund et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , while predehl & schmitt used , implicitly , the old solar abundances . for neon and magnesium , however , the abundances have not changed , while the change for oxygen should not have a large effect , since for the one case where we measure it  for 4u 0142 + 61 only ",
    "the inferred  is consistent with the values inferred from neon and magnesium ( see table  [ nh ] ) .",
    "while the above indicates one should be somewhat careful in using the absolute values of the reddening , the relative reddenings should be much more accurate , since any systematic uncertainties in the conversion should be similar from source to source .",
    "our results indicate that in order of increasing reddening , the axps are 4u 0142@xmath361 , 1e 1048.1@xmath55937 , 1e 2259@xmath3586 and 1rxs j170849.0@xmath5400910 .",
    "we can compare our revised estimates with earlier work .",
    "first , for 4u 0142 + 61 , hulleman et al .  (",
    "2004 ) found from the colors of field stars , that the reddening along the line of sight was likely substantially lower than the value @xmath98 inferred from the literature values of  for the power - law plus black - body model .",
    "our new value of @xmath99 is consistent with the range of @xmath100 to 4 seen in their fig .",
    "second , comparing 4u 0142 + 61 with 1e 1048.1@xmath55937 , durant & van kerkwijk ( 2005 ) noted that in order for the broad - band optical / infrared spectrum of these axps to have the same shape , the difference in reddening would have to be @xmath101 .",
    "this was inconsistent with previous estimates , which gave very similar values of @xmath96 ( based on the very similar values of ; see table  [ nhlit ] ) , but is consistent with our new results , which give a difference in reddening of @xmath102 .",
    "thus , the optical / infrared spectra of the different axps may be similar in shape , and therefore produced by the same mechanism .",
    "with our empirical estimates of the intrinsic ( soft ) x - ray spectra , and the revised estimate for optical / infrared reddening , we can re - examine the spectral energy distributions of the axps .",
    "we only consider 4u 0142@xmath361 , since this object is the only one for which we find a significantly different column density from that typically quoted .",
    "furthermore , it has the best x - ray data , and the best broad - band coverage , from mid - infrared ( wang et al .",
    "2006 ) , to near - infrared and optical ( hulleman et al .  2004",
    "; israel et al .  2004 ) , to hard x - rays ( den hartog et al .",
    "2006 ) .    61 .",
    "triangles are xmm / rgs data , as observed ( open ) and de - extincted ( filled ) as described in the text .",

    "jkh from israel et al .",
    "( 2004 ) ; bvri from hulleman et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "filled squares are the photometric points de - reddened with @xmath103 ( see text )",
    ". crosses in the higher - energy x - ray part of the spectrum come from _ chandra _ ( juett et al . ,",
    "2002 ) ; extinction is not important in this region of the spectrum .",
    "xmm data is binned in frequency ( @xmath104 ) corresponding to @xmath105 , and _",
    "chandra _ data to @xmath106  for clarity . ]",
    "figure [ sed ] shows the inferred intrinsic spectral energy distribution of 4u 0142@xmath361 , determined with our new values of and @xmath96 .",
    "the interpretation of the optical and infrared emission is still unclear : it could be understood as combination of a large mid - infrared bump combined with a rising power - law that has a sharp break at b , or as a combination of a much smaller mid - infrared bump combined with a flatter power - law and a large emission feature centered between r and  v. wang et al .",
    "( 2006 ) interpret the mid - infrared bump as arising from a passively illuminated dusty disc .",
    "this disc is presumably formed from supernova fall - back material , and the data is well fitted by a blackbody from dust at the sublimation radius .",
    "this disc would also influence the flux in the k - band .",
    "wang et al . used our new estimate of , but their results are not very sensitive to the exact value of , as long as the reddening is above @xmath107 ( chakrabarty , 2005 , pers .",
    "comm . ) .",
    "the soft x - ray spectrum in figure [ sed ] suggestively has a slope which would meet up with the optical points if extended .",
    "this is in marked contrast with the earlier power - law models , which grossly over - predict the optical emission ( see  1 ) .",
    "the uncertainty in the slope of the soft x - rays is dominated by the uncertainty in the hydrogen column ( and its systematics , particularly due to abundance uncertainties ) , so there is not enough information at present to say whether the break between the b- and v - bands is due to an emission or an absorption feature .",
    "we have attempted to measure the extinction to the axps without making assumptions about what their intrinsic spectral shapes might be . with our resulting best estimates , we derived intrinsic spectra , which can be compared with each other as well as with predictions , such as those from simulations and semi - analytic models that are now being produced within the magnetar framework ( e.g. , lyutikov & gavriil 2006 ; r.  fernndez & c.  thompson 2006 , pers .  comm . ) .    apart from these comparisons , future work could include extending our analysis to other sources ( once better spectra become available ) , or improving the precision of our measurements using further _ xmm - newton _ observations ( some already taken but not yet public ) or _ chandra _ spectra ( some available ) .",
    "more interestingly , by measuring the run of reddening with distance along the line of sight to the axps ( using field stars ) , our extinction estimates can be used to estimate distances and thus determine the intrinsic luminosities of the axps .",
    "it turns out that although the extinctions are not very well determined , the axps fall into areas of rapidly rising extinction associated with spiral arms , and so can be well localized ( durant & van kerkwijk , 2006 ) .",
    "finally , our reddening estimates will place on much firmer footing inferences from further optical and infrared studies , such as could be used , e.g. , to uncover the nature of the break seen between @xmath108 and @xmath109 in 4u 0142 + 61 ( hulleman et al .",
    "2004 ) or to measure the precise parameters of the possible debris disk around that source ( wang et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
