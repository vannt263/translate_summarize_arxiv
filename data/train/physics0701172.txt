    "<S> a thin metal slab is known to be able to focus the near fields of tm wave of a point source . here </S>",
    "<S> , we show that a thin metal slab in fact possesses a far - field image and through a simple modification on the system by resonance tunneling , a double metal slab can give a bright image with both the far - field and the near - field details .    </S>",
    "<S> double - negative ( dng ) medium , with permittivity ( @xmath0 ) and permeability ( @xmath1 ) simultaneously negative , exhibits a negative value of refractive index @xcite and the resulting negative refraction has been demonstrated both numerically @xcite and experimentally @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dng slab with @xmath2 is a perfect lens @xcite in the sense that it can focus all geometric beams ( the far fields ) of different directions from a point source to a real image by negative refraction and it can compensate exactly all the evanescent waves ( the near fields ) . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental realization of the perfect lens is difficult due to its extreme sensitivity to the system parameters @xcite . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> if we are working in the near - field regime for tm waves , the condition @xmath3 is sufficient so that a thin metallic film acts as a near - field lens @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the metallic film , the position of the focal plane for the far fields is ambiguous although it is a common practice @xcite to place the image plane at a distance double the slab thickness beyond the point source . </S>",
    "<S> the position of the focal plane is proposed to be determined from the phase contour or the streamline of poynting vector @xcite but whether a far - field image exists remains unclear .     </S>",
    "<S> is the lateral beam shift . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath4 is the phase change across the slab . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 is the phase change in vacuum and @xmath6 is the total phase change for the beam in returning to the z axis . </S>",
    "<S> , width=268 ]    in this paper , we take an alternative approach by considering the far - field focusing of a thin slab with arbitrary @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that if the slab can be regarded as a lens , the phase of the source - to - image transfer function can only be certain quantized values . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath7 perfect lens is a special case of the general condition . </S>",
    "<S> it follows naturally from our results that a `` single negative '' metallic film can focus a point source to a far - field image . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , a fabry - perot - like cavity of two metallic films can provide both far - field and near - field imaging with high transmittance . here </S>",
    "<S> , a far - field image means the image formed by all the propagating waves and it can be recorded ( e.g. by a camera ) far away from the lens .    </S>",
    "<S> let us first establish the condition for negative refraction ( a negative lateral shift ) for a flat slab of pre - specified values of permittivity @xmath8 and permeability @xmath9 . without loss of generality , we consider tm waves . fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] shows a schematic diagram showing the situation when a geometric beam impinges on this slab . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath10 here is defined as the distance measured from the exit interface of the slab when the beam returns to the z - axis and @xmath11 is the lateral beam shift . for negative ( positive ) refraction </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath10 is positive ( negative ) and @xmath12 is negative ( positive ) . using the stationary - phase method @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath10 can be proved to be given by    @xmath13    where @xmath4 is the phase change across the slab and we use @xmath14(@xmath15 to denote the wave number in the z - direction in the slab ( vacuum ) . in general </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath10 is a function of the incident angle where @xmath16 ranges from 0 at grazing incidence to @xmath17 ( the wave number in vacuum ) at normal incidence .    </S>",
    "<S> now , we search for optimal configurations such that @xmath10 is nearly independent of the incident angle ( measured by @xmath18 ) . </S>",
    "<S> such an optimal configuration implies the slab behaves like a lens , and the lensing condition can be restated in terms of the phase change as    @xmath19    where @xmath6 is the total phase change when the beam returns to the z - axis . we can measure how well eq . ( [ eq3 ] ) can be satisfied by defining an operational aberration using    @xmath20    which measures the deviation of @xmath21 from its para - axial value . for a slab of thickness @xmath22 , </S>",
    "<S> the values of @xmath23 are plotted in grayscale in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] with black color denoting smaller values . </S>",
    "<S> the loci of the local minima of @xmath23 in the @xmath24 plane defines the configurations for good focusing . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , they form bands and each band can be characterized according to the total elapsed phase by    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is any integer and the approximation is valid for all @xmath18 ranging from @xmath27 to @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the stationary @xmath28 is thus quantized . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the bands can be approximated by analytic formulas . </S>",
    "<S> we will not prove them in details but simply state them here . </S>",
    "<S> we found that there are two scenarios that can lead to eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq4 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the first scenario is given by    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is defined by @xmath31 and @xmath26 is an integer . </S>",
    "<S> eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq5 ] ) yields the bands of @xmath32 in the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane . </S>",
    "<S> these bands for a slab of @xmath33 are plotted as black open circles in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the two bands of @xmath34 correspond to a transparent slab of refractive index + 1 and a dng slab of refractive index 1 . </S>",
    "<S> the second scenario is given by    @xmath35    which yields the bands of @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> these bands are plotted as white crosses in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] . in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq6 ] ) , @xmath30 can be either purely real or purely imaginary from its definition .    </S>",
    "<S> we see that the bands of @xmath37 is in general broader than the bands of @xmath32 ( which includes @xmath38 as a special case ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dng lens with @xmath7 is the `` best lens '' since it has exactly zero aberration , but it is also the least robust . </S>",
    "<S> the `` poor man s superlens '' show up as a special case as the band @xmath39 . only @xmath0 is negative ( single - negative ) , but the aberration can be very small . in particular , we select the case @xmath40 along this band . </S>",
    "<S> it has the smallest aberration of @xmath41 with @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> the lens formula , like the dng lens , is governed by @xmath43 where @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) is the distance of the point source ( image ) from the first ( second ) interface . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath46 is positive ( negative ) for a real ( virtual ) image . </S>",
    "<S> if we denote @xmath47 as the complex transfer amplitude from the source to the image for the lens , the image is formed due to the phase conservation of @xmath47 at different incident angles and it does not require the amplitude of @xmath47 to be a constant . in the current example , the amplitude varies from 0.3 at normal incidence to 0 at grazing incidence . </S>",
    "<S> as the image is formed by tunnelling , @xmath10 stays nearly the same as we increases the slab thickness ( unlike the dng slab where @xmath10 scales with the slab thickness ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the transfer amplitude drops exponentially with the slab thickness .    . </S>",
    "<S> the open circles and crosses show the analytic results . </S>",
    "<S> the grayscale shows the operational aberration ( @xmath48 ) defined in text with black color denoting smaller values of aberration.,width=374 ]            we have shown that a metal slab can have a far - field image . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , an example of optimal aberration has been given explicitly . </S>",
    "<S> based on the optimal example , the brightness of the image can in fact be increased to nearly unity using an interesting property of tunnelling focusing . as the slab has a mirror symmetry in the z - axis , the reflection phase @xmath49 from the slab entrance interface satisfies @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> if we stack another slab of the same configuration at precisely one @xmath10 beyond the original slab ( details shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] ) , the phase change per cycle within the cavity is @xmath51 or @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> it is a resonating condition satisfied for all incident angles , resulting in an all - angle ( or equivalently a real - space ) fabry - perot ( fp ) cavity . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , a real image is formed at one @xmath10 beyond the second slab with @xmath53 which is independent of the incident angle . as an example , if we stack two identical metal slabs with @xmath54 and thickness @xmath55 together with an air gap equal to one @xmath10 of that a single slab in between , we can form a real image with @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] illustrates the source and the image profile for this double - slab system if we place a point source at @xmath57 in front of the first slab . only propagating fields from the point source </S>",
    "<S> are included in our calculation . </S>",
    "<S> the intensity at the source point is normalized to one and nearly the same intensity is found at the image . in principle , the propagating wave transmittance is essentially unity independent of the incident angle for thin slabs , but if thicker metal slabs are employed , the transmittance of the double - slab system becomes more sensitive to the aberration the single - slab system .    </S>",
    "<S> we now consider the evanescent wave components . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5](a ) shows @xmath47 of the same system plotted against @xmath58 , the wave number in the transverse direction . from @xmath59 to @xmath17 ( the propagating waves ) , @xmath60 for all incident angles . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the image profile for a far - field observer is simply @xmath61 as shown by the solid line in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , for a far - field observer , the double - slab system behaves just like the dng perfect lens . for the near fields with @xmath62 , the double - slab system can also support surface plasmons , indicated by the peaks shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5](a ) , and this leads to super - resolution . the image profile with the evanescent waves included </S>",
    "<S> is shown by the solid line in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> it has a half - pitch resolution of @xmath63 which breaks the diffraction limit . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed lines in fig . [ fig5](b ) and ( c ) show the image profile if we introduce some absorption ( an extra @xmath64 is added to the permittivity of the metal ) into the system . the lensing effect is still retained . </S>",
    "<S> a double - layer structure is currently employed for reducing the absorption in near - field focusing in the literature @xcite our results show that a similar system can work for the far fields as well by tuning it into fp resonance . </S>",
    "<S> the image can be transferred farther away by cascading a number of these cavities .    in summary , we have considered the general lensing condition for a homogeneous slab , which is found to be discrete values of the transmission phase . </S>",
    "<S> for a metal slab capable in focusing , an all - angle fp cavity can be constructed by stacking two of them . </S>",
    "<S> a far - field image with high transmittance is formed . </S>",
    "<S> the double - slab system is an improved version of the near - field lens from a single metallic film as far - field focusing can also be obtained . </S>"
