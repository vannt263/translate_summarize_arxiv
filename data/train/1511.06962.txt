    "the study of relativistic models of compact stars like neutron stars and strange stars are always a topic of immense interest to the researchers in the field of astrophysics .",
    "neutron stars are composed of neutrons , while strange stars are composed of quark or strange matter consisting of u , d , and s quarks .",
    "@xcite proposed that the formation of strange matter can be classified into two ways : the quark hadron phase transition in the early universe and conversion of neutron stars into strange stars at ultrahigh densities . according to @xcite",
    "a phase transition between hadronic and strange quark matter may occur in the universe at a density higher than the nuclear density when a massive star explodes as a supernova . as a result",
    "strange quark is likely to be seen at the inner core of star .",

    "their difference @xmath4 is called the measure of anisotropy .",
    "anisotropy may occurs in various reasons , e.g. , the existence of solid core , in presence of type p superfluid , phase transition , mixture of two fluid , existence of external field etc .",
    "+ a large number of anisotropic models are available in the literature . local anisotropy in self - gravitating systems were studied by @xcite ( and reference within this ) .",
    "@xcite has given a model of a stable dark energy star by assuming two spatial types of mass function : one is of constant energy density and the other by considering @xcite mass function .",
    "various features of dark energy star and stability analysis one can find in model proposed by @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite proposed a new model of dark energy star consisting of five zones , namely , the solid core of constant energy density , the thin shell between core and interior , an inhomogeneous interior region with anisotropic pressures , a thin shell , and the exterior vacuum region .",
    "they discussed various physical properties .",
    "the model satisfies all the physical requirements and stability condition under a small radial pulsations is also discussed . by assuming a special type of matter density @xcite proposed an model of anisotropic star . from their analysis authors have shown that the absolute stability bound @xmath5 can be violated and the star s surface redshift may be arbitrarily large .",
    "a new class of interior solution of a ( 2 + 1)-dimensional anisotropic star in finch and skea spacetime corresponding to the exterior btz black hole was developed by @xcite .",
