    "damped ly@xmath0 ( dla ) systems ( @xmath5 n(hi ) @xmath6 20.3 @xmath7 ) are seen in absorption in the qso spectra up to the highest redshift .",
    "they likely trace the field population of galaxies with no a priori selection based on morphology , since biases apply to the background sources at first approximation and not to the intervening systems .",
    "the identification of the galaxy population associated with the dlas has important bearings on cosmological elemental evolution and has been actively debated .",
    "wolfe et al . ( 1995 ) and prochaska & wolfe ( 1997,1999 ) suggested a close connection between the dla galaxies and the progenitors of present - day spiral galaxies .",
    "the connection is based on the fact that the comoving gas density of the dla galaxies at high redshift roughly equals the local density provided by the luminous matter in nearby spiral galaxies .",
    "in addition , the kinematics of the metal lines has been interpreted as having formed in massive rotating disks .",
    "however , rao & turnshek ( 2000 ) did not find a decrease in the comoving gas density of dla galaxies at low redshifts as expected if the gas had been converted into stars , and haehnelt , steinmetz , & rauch ( 1998 ) and ledoux et al .",
    "( 1998 ) did not find the kinematical argument very compelling .",
    "dla systems offer the possibility to measure abundances accurately for a wide range of elements in a variety of normal , gas - rich galaxies spanning a considerable look - back time .",
    "the metallicity of dla galaxies is generally inferred from the absolute abundance of the volatile element zinc which is found at @xmath8 10% of solar , with no clear evolution over the redshift interval from @xmath1 @xmath4 0.5 up to 3 ( pettini et al .",
    "the apparent lack of evolution has been considered a problem for the interpretation of dlas as proto - spirals , in particular at low redshift where abundances much closer to the solar ones are expected .",
    "the models of fritze et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for sa and sd galaxies bracket the zn data from the high and low metallicity sides over the entire redshift range , but require that dlas are biased against early type spirals at low redshift .",
    "a possible bias is represented by the low gas and the high dust contents of early type galaxies at low redshift . on the same line ,",
    "prantzos and boisser ( 2000 ) found the observed zn abundances consistent with a spiral origin once the empirical relation 18.8@xmath9 [ zn / h]+@xmath10 21 is imposed to the models .",
    "jimenez et al . ( 1999 ) found that the population of low surface brighness galaxies ( lsb ) better matches the observed zinc metallicities .",
    "imaging of dla galaxies at relatively low redshift revealed that the population of dla galaxies is not dominated by spirals but rather composed by a variety of morphological types which include lsb , dwarf irregulars and late type spirals .",
    "( le brun et al . 1997 ; rao & turnshek 1998 ) .",
    "relative elemental abundances are an important complement to the information provided by absolute abundances such as zinc metallicity . in particular , ratios of elements which are produced by type i and type ii supernovae in different proportions provide independent insights into defining the kind of chemical evolution . despite the efforts of different authors , it has been difficult to establish the [ @xmath0/fe ] abundance pattern in dla systems because of the different level of depletion of refractory elements onto dust grains . in the compilation of savaglio",
    "et al . ( 2000 ) the average of 37 measures is @xmath11[si / fe]@xmath12 + 0.43 @xmath2 0.18.= log ( x / hi ) - log ( x / h ) ] at face value this is consistent with what is observed in the galactic halo stars , which has been interpreted as evidence for an origin of dlas in proto - spirals ( lu et al .",
    "1996 , prochaska & wolfe 1999 ) .",
    "evidence that at least in some dlas relative abundances do not conform to those of the galactic halo stars was first provided by molaro et al .",

    "molaro , centurin , & vladilo ( 1998 ) and centurin et al .",
    "( 2000 ) also found the ratio of the undepleted elements sulphur and zinc to be approximately solar in a sample of half a dozen dlas .",
    "vladilo ( 1998 ) corrected the abundances of si and fe for the differential elemental depletion and obtained approximate solar ratios ( [ si / fe]@xmath40 ) in all cases investigated , thus suggesting that solar ratios might be rather common among dlas .",
    "pettini et al .",
    "( 2000 ) considering dlas with low dust depletion found [ si / fe ] ratios broadly in line with galactic stellar values although there are also examples of near - solar [ si / fe ] ratios at [ fe / h]@xmath111 .",
    "savaglio et al . ( 2000 ) , after correcting for dust , found evidence for overabundance of a factor 2 in si in about 1/4 of the dla systems .",
    "the [ o / zn ] ratio is probably the best diagnostic tool for the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratio we have for dlas since oxygen is produced by typeii sne and is essentially undepleted in the interstellar medium .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to obtain the oxygen abundance with the required accuracy . in the present study of the z=3.3901 dla system towards qso",
    "00002620 we present an accurate oxygen abundance determination based on unsaturated lines , together with a zn detection at the highest redshift ever obtained , and discuss the [ o / zn ] ratio in connection with the chemical evolution of the associated galaxy .",

    "we have used the data of higher quality : two exposures of 4000 sec and one of 4500 sec secured on october 13 , when the seeing , as given by the telescope guide probe , was between 0.35 and 0.5 arcsec fwhm .",

    "the observed wavelength scale of each spectrum was then transformed into vacuum , heliocentric wavelength scale .",
    "the spectra were then added together by using their s / n as weights .",
    "finally , the local continuum was determined in the average spectrum by using a spline to smoothly connect the regions free from absorption features .",
    "the continuum for the ly@xmath0 forest region was fitted by using the small regions deemed to be free of absorptions and by interpolating between these regions with a spline .    with respect to the previous eso ntt observations ,",
    "uves spectra have a higher extension into the blue as well as a more than double resolution and higher s / n . with respect to the keck data , which cover the range 51007660  , uves spectra extend further towards both the blue and the red sides . in the region of overlap , which extends from @xmath8 6700",

    "with such a large column density , the ion species are from the dominant ionization stages in hi gas and do not require ionization corrections ( viegas 1995 ) .",
    "the damped structure is known to include minor additional components on both sides of the main absorption ( molaro et al .",

    "1996 ) , but our analysis is restricted to the unsaturated lines were these weak components do not appear and do not affect the abundances .    the derived column densities and @xmath25-values , together with the redshifts , are reported in table 1 .",
    "the difficulty in determining accurate oi column densities stems from the fact that the only transition available redwards the ly@xmath0 emission is oi @xmath3 1302  which has always been found heavily saturated in dlas . on the other hand",
    "oi @xmath3 1356  has never been detected and has provided only loose upper limits . upon searching the ly@xmath0 forest we detected several oxygen lines , namely oi @xmath3925.446 , @xmath3929.517 , @xmath3 936.629 , @xmath3 948.685 , @xmath3950.884 , @xmath3988.773 , @xmath3 1039.230  which are relatively free from contamination caused by hydrogen clouds .",

    "1 . owing to the presence of minor contaminants we analyzed the two lines independently . the two lines yield similar column densities , where that obtained from oi @xmath3 925   is slightly higher .",
    "we notice that the oi @xmath3 925    is somewhat broader ( @xmath25=14 km s@xmath22 ) than the other metal lines , thus suggesting the presence of some blend which may explain the small difference in the column densities . in fitting oi",
    "@xmath3 950 the presence of the wing of the ly@xmath31 line on the blue side is accounted for .",
    "the adopted abundance for oi is taken as the straight average of the two measurements , i.e. @xmath5n(oi)=16.42 ( or [ o / h]=1.85@xmath20.1 ) with an error of @xmath20.1 which accounts for the uncertainty in the continuum placement .",

    "the value found here is [ zn / h]=2.07 which is consistent with the upper limits set at [ zn / h]@xmath91.76 ( 3@xmath32 ) by pettini et al .",
    "( 1995 ) .",
    "we have clearly detected the niii @xmath3 1709  while the niii @xmath3 1751   showed to be partially blended with an o@xmath33 atmospheric line .",
    "the abundances of niii @xmath3 1709   yields [ ni / h]=2.27 , which is also consistent with the value of niii @xmath3 1751   when the telluric contamination is accounted for .",
    "we note that the abundance of ni , despite the recent upwards revision in the @xmath34 values by fedchak and lawler ( 1999 ) , remains slightly lower than the other iron - peak elements .",
    "other transitions present in our spectrum such as alii and civ are either saturated or are not significantly different from the values published in the quoted references . in this paper",
    "they are not examined again .",
    "zinc abundances have been used to trace back the cosmological chemical evolution of damped ly@xmath0 galaxies . instead of the expected growth of metallicity with cosmic time , which is a natural outcome of stellar evolution , pettini et al .",
    "( 1999 ) could not find any trend of the [ zn / h ] ratio with z@xmath35 .",
    "the dla towards qso 00002620 is the only one at z@xmath36 3 for which a zn abundance measurement is available at present .",
    "the zinc abundance is found at [ zn / h]=2.07 , which is the lowest level found so far in any dla at any redshift .",
    "the low metallicity level shows that this ly@xmath0 galaxy is indeed in the early stages of its chemical evolution .",
    "when compared with extant data , this zn abundance suggests that a mild chemical evolution is present in the dla population .",
    "observational biases may affect this conclusion , as discussed in a separate paper ( vladilo et al . 2000 ) .",
    "a second important point is that zinc abundance at [ zn / h]=2.07 is fully consistent with both iron and chromium abundances , which are [ fe / h]=2.04 and [ cr / h]=2.0 respectively .",
    "it is well established that in the dlas zn is consistently more abundant than cr and fe ( pettini et al .",
    "1994 , 1997 ) , while in galactic halo stars both cr and zn track the fe content down to very low metallicities .",
    "the different behavior of fe and zn in the dlas is currently interpreted as the result of differential depletion of these elements from the gas phase onto dust grains in analogy with the nearby interstellar medium .",
    "the fact that in this dla the abundances of the refractory elements fe and cr are found close to the non - refractory element zn suggests that dust grains have not yet formed in this protogalaxy .",
    "such a circumstance is extremely rare among dlas , and even in the cases with low depletion considered by pettini et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , a difference between zn and the other refractory elements fe , cr and ni has been always observed .",
    "the absence of dust in this damped system frees the measurements of relative abundances from the uncertainties deriving from the unknown fraction of elements which condensate onto grains , thus making this dla of particular value in the study of chemical composition patterns .",
    "information on @xmath0-capture elements is important because in the early stages of the chemical evolution of galaxies the abundances are likely dominated by type ii sne products which are richer in @xmath0-elements than type i sne which entered into the game only later on .",
    "thus in the early stages the @xmath0-capture elements are expected to be relatively more abundant than the iron - peak elements , and the ratio should reverse later on during evolution .",
    "the exact timing of the turn - over depends on both the sfr and imf , which differ for the different types of galaxies .",
    "the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratio is therefore an indicator of the chemical evolution history which can be used to understand the nature of galaxies when data on their morphology and colors are lacking .",
    "silicon is the most accessible @xmath0 element in dlas and the compilation of savaglio et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , who consider 37 measures , obtain a mean value of @xmath11[si / fe]@xmath12=0.43@xmath20.18 .",
    "the problem here is that we observe a similar ratio ( [ si / fe]=+0.36 ) in the warm phase of the galactic interstellar medium , due to the fact that the gaseous silicon and iron abundances are lowered by different amounts by dust depletion ( savage & sembach 1996 ) . after accounting for dust , savaglio et al .",
    "( 2000 ) conclude that si is intrinsically enhanced in comparison to iron only in about 25% of the dlas with siii determined .",
    "outram et al .",
    "( 1999 ) in two dla systems inferred the absence of dust from the similarity of si and s abundances and argued for an intrinsic overabundance of [ @xmath0/fe ] of about 0.5 dex .",
    "however , as noted in matteucci et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , si might be produced in type i sne , which could explain the complicate observational pattern .",
    "therefore , si should be considered an indicator of @xmath0 element abundances less reliable than o or s.    evidence that relative abundances in some dlas do not conform to those of the galactic halo stars has been provided by the [ s / zn ] ratio ( molaro et al .",
    "1996 , 1998 , centurin et al .",
    "2000 ) in a sample of 6 dlas but with one case , the dla at z@xmath35=2.476 towards q0841 + 129 , consistent with [ s / zn]@xmath120.2 .",
    "the oxygen abundance we derive here is the first one obtained by means of unsaturated lines .",
    "since the transitions lie in the forest , the uncertainty is dominated by possible ly@xmath0 interlopers . however",
    ", if these hydrogen lines do actually contaminate the spectrum at the wavelength of the oxygen lines , the real oxygen abundance should be even lower than the value found here .",
    "oxygen is a typical product of type ii sne and in the atmospheres of galactic metal - poor stars it shows the notorious enhancement of [ o / fe ] @xmath21 + 0.5 .",
    "claims for an even more extreme oxygen overabundance with [ o / fe ] reaching + 1.0 dex at [ fe / h]=3.0 have been made recently by israelian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and boesgaard et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "oxygen has a rather small condensation temperature ( t@xmath37 @xmath4 180 k ) and its depletion factor is of 0.00@xmath38 dex in the warm gas phase towards @xmath39 ophiuchi ( savage & sembach 1996 ) .",
    "therefore , the [ o / zn ] ratio is an excellent dust - free diagnostic tool for the [ @xmath0/iron - peak ] abundance ratio .    from the average of the two transitions we derive [ o / h]=1.86 , which implies [ o / zn]=0.21 , a relatively modest , if any , @xmath0 enhancement",
    "si abundance is almost the same as oxygen and we obtain [ si / h]=1.91 , which corresponds to [ si / zn]=0.16 . we note also here that lu et al .",
    "( 1996 ) tentatively identified the sii 1253.811   line associated with the damped , and derived a column density @xmath5 n(sii ) = 14.70 @xmath2 0.03 , i.e. an abundance of [ s / h]=1.91 , which implies [ s / zn]=0.16 .",
    "thus , the s abundance of lu et al .",
    "( 1996 ) is also consistent with our o and si abundances in the system .",
    "for the first time in the dla studied here we have at our disposal a set of 3 indicators for the @xmath0 element abundances and three indicators for the iron peak elemental abundances , which do not need any dust correction .",
    "the [ o , si , s / zn , fe , cr ] ratios , in whatever combination the elements are chosen , are in the range 0.090.22 dex .",
    "this range of values is significantly lower than analogous ratios in galactic stars with comparable metallicities , and the difference is more stringent in this case for the low value of the metallicity , which is one order of magnitude lower than the average value in dlas .",
    "the lack of significant [ @xmath0/fe ] enhancement corroborates previous results on this system as well as the suggestion that , on the basis of their relative elements , at least some dla galaxies seem to undergo a chemical evolution which differs from that of the milky  way .",
    "centurin et al .",
    "( 2000 ) showed that the [ s / zn ] ratios in dlas are consistent with a decreasing trend with increasing metallicity .",
    "these ratios show also a correlation , although less clear - cut , with cosmic time , where the lower [ s / zn ] values occur mostly at low redshifts .",
    "the [ s / zn]=0.16 and [ o / zn]=0.19 for our dla add a new point which supports the presence of such trends .",
    "considering the extant data of [ s / zn ] and the value [ o / zn]=0.20 we derived here , the regression analysis yields the correlation [ s , o / zn ] = 0.36(@xmath20.11)[zn / h ]  0.52 .",
    "the @xmath0/iron - peak ratio becomes solar at [ fe / h ] @xmath4 - 1.4 and further decreases at higher metallicities .",
    "chemical evolutionary models predict solar [ @xmath0/fe ] at low metallicities , when star formation proceeds in bursts separated by relatively long quiescent periods or whenever star formation is slower than that of our galaxy .",
    "these conditions are met in dwarf galaxies , lsb galaxies and in the outer regions of disks ( matteucci et al .",
    "1997 , jimnez et al .",
    "1999 ) . in these galaxies",
    "the metal enrichment is so slow that type ia supernovae have enough time to evolve and enrich the gas with iron - peak elements , in such a way that reduced @xmath0 over iron ratios are attained at low metallicity .    in the milky way few metal poor stars with solar [ @xmath0/fe - peak ] ratios",
    "have been found ( carney et al .",
    "1997 , nissen & schuster 1997 ) .",
    "these exceptional stars show large apogalactic distances and it was suggested that they belonged to a satellite galaxy which experienced a different chemical evolution history than the milky way , and were subsequently accreted by the latter .",
    "incidentally , we note that the interpretation of the low [ o / fe ] ratio at low metallicities as an intrinsic effect of typei sne does not support the suggestion by umeda et al .",
    "( 1999 ) that type i sne may be suppressed at metallicities lower that [ fe / h ] @xmath111.0 .      in our system the nitrogen abundances",
    "relative to zn and o are [ n / zn]=0.54 and [ n / o]=0.74 .",
    "both values are somewhat lower than previously reported by molaro et al .",
    "( 1996 ) because of the upwards revision in oxygen and iron abundances . the [ n / o ] is not so extreme as previously thought , but the n abundance still requires a primary production of the element according to the evolutionary models discussed in matteucci et al ( 1997 ) .",
    "n abundance in this dla , but also in other dlas , remain lower than the corresponding values in the milky way , where n is found to trace fe in lockstep ( israelian et al .",
    "2000 ) , which again suggests a different pattern than the milky way .",
    "nitrogen abundances have been discussed by lu , sargent , & barlow ( 1998 ) and by centurin et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , who pointed out the presence of a real scatter among dla systems with some values very close to a pure secondary behavior and other values which require a primary nucleosynthesis .",
    "the different values of n / o observed at a given o / h may be understood in terms of the delayed delivery of primary n with respect to o when star formation proceeds in bursts . during the quiescence period n",
    "is deposited in the ism and the n / o ratio increases while o / h remains constant .",
    "therefore a relatively high [ n / o ] , such as that observed here , nicely fits with the picture of a delayed n release after a quiescence period , which is also required by the low @xmath0 over iron ratios .",
    "uves observations of the qso 0000 - 2620 resulted in the detection of the znii 2026.136   transition originated in the damped system at z@xmath14=3.3901 .",
    "the abundance derived is [ zn / h]=-2.06 which is presently the lowest among dlas .",
    "this low metallicity level shows that the galaxy is in the early stages of its chemical evolution .",
    "when compared with the larger abundances observed in dla galaxies at lower redshift , this measurement provides a first hint of a cosmological chemical evolution in which abundances increase with decreasing redshift ( see vladilo et al 2000 )    the abundances of cr and fe were also obtained and found similar to the abundance of zn .",
    "this coincidence in the abundances between refractory and non refractory elements is interpreted as dust has not formed yet .",
    "the oi 925   and 950   lines were detected although they fall within the lyman@xmath0 forest .",
    "these lines have oscillator strengths much smaller than that of the oi 1302   line which is strongly saturated .",
    "these detections allow , for the first time , a rather accurate measurement of the oxygen abundance in a dla system . the oxygen abundance ,",
    "[ o / h]=-1.85 , is remarkably similar to the sulphur abundance derived by lu et al ( 1996 ) , [ s / h]=-1.91 , and both abundances are similar to that of silicon , [ si / h]=-1.91 , which is consistent with the absence of dust in the system as implied by zn and fe abundances .    in this dla",
    "the relative abundances of @xmath0 and iron - peak elements are mildly overabundant compared to solar and do not show the enhancement expected for a progenitor of an early type spiral such as our own galaxy .",
    "the paradigm of dlas as progenitors of the milky - way type spirals is not supported by the study of the dust - independent chemical evolution indicators such as [ o / zn ] and [ s / zn ] .",
    "the almost solar abundance ratios measured at the low metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath4=2 suggest that this dla should be associated with objects with low , or episodic , star formation rates such as lsb or dwarf galaxies . however , these results are not characteristic of this dla alone and similar low [ s / zn ] ratios are also found in other dlas ( centurin et al 2000 ) .",
    "the new high resolution spectra analyzed in this paper are of unique quality and were obtained during the first nights of commissioning of a new instrument at a new telescope . for these results we are indebted to all eso staff involved in the vlt construction and in uves commissioning .",
