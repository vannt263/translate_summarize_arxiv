    "the final merger of two black holes ( bhs ) having comparable masses will produce an intense burst of gravitational radiation , and is expected to be one of the strongest sources in the gravitational - wave sky .",
    "mergers of stellar black holes are key targets for ground - based detectors such as ligo , virgo , and geo600 , and knowledge of the merger waveforms is an important component of improving the detectability of such systems .",
    "the space - based lisa detector will observe mergers of massive black holes at high signal - to - noise ratios , allowing tests of general relativity in the strong - field , dynamical regime .",
    "today , numerical relativity ( nr ) studies are beginning to progress toward a full description of black - hole binary merger systems .",
    "for noneccentric inspirals , this space is spanned by seven parameters : the symmetric mass - ratio @xmath1 , and the six combined components of the black holes spin vectors .",
    "considerable study has been focused on the fiducial center point of this parameter space , the case of equal - mass nonspinning black - hole mergers .",
    "after the series of breakthroughs that ushered in an era of rapid progress in the field @xcite , several investigations assessing the accuracy of the available equal mass waveforms and applying them to data analysis were conducted @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we undertake a descriptive study of the waveforms generated in the late inspiral and merger of black - hole binaries for the subspace of nonspinning black holes , parametrized only by @xmath2 .",
    "our study is based on a series of numerical simulations , discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : simulations ] , covering at least the last @xmath3 orbits of nonspinning black - hole binary mergers with mass ratios extending to 6:1 ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "several of the simulations presented here have already been applied in a recent paper , focusing on the development of a faithful analytic waveform model @xcite . here",
    "we provide details of these and additional simulations , together with considerable analysis , focused on providing a qualitative and quantitative picture of how the waveforms from nonspinning black - hole mergers depend on @xmath2 .",
    "nonspinning black - hole binary merger waveforms were previously examined in ref .",
    "@xcite , but our analysis is novel and complementary to that work .",
    "our descriptive presentation puts emphasis on the relationships between waveforms from the different mass - ratio cases and different harmonic modes , with references to ref .",
    "@xcite where related observations have been made .",
    "our approach to describing the inspiral - merger - ringdown transition is particularly distinct , founded in a uniform approach that describes all stages of this process in similar terms , and ultimately suggesting a complementary physical picture .",
    "black - hole - binary merger waveforms have been noted for their `` simplicity . '' for the nonspinning systems the simple physics of the coalescence is exposed by a spherical harmonic decomposition of the waveforms . in sec .",
    "[ sec : description ] we walk readers through the basic features of the radiation , characterizing amplitude and phase evolution of the multipolar components , and discussing relationships among the simulations representing different mass ratios , and among the multipolar components of each simulation .",
    "as we analyze the waveforms we develop a conceptual interpretation of the basic waveform features . in this interpretation",
    "we consider the structure of an _ implicit rotating source _ , which could have generated the measured radiation through its rotational motion .",
    "this allows a uniform interpretation that applies throughout the coalescence process : inspiral , merger and ringdown .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : description2 ] , we examine the strong final burst of radiation beginning @xmath5 before the formation of a common horizon .",
    "we quantitatively describe the phasing in terms of an analytic model , based on a continuous , monotonically increasing frequency .",
    "we find , in particular , that the peak rate of change in frequency , appropriately scaled , is the same across all @xmath0 modes and mass ratios",
    ". we also identify relationships among the mode amplitudes and phases , which are connected to an approximately linear relationship between angular momentum and frequency : @xmath6 .",
    "we interpret these relationships in terms of the implicit source .    finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : neweob ] , we demonstrate the utility of what we have learned in our waveform characterization by applying some of the quantitative features we have uncovered in a new variation on the analytic waveform model in @xcite , which was based on the effective - one - body ( eob ) resummation of the post - newtonian(pn ) approximation to inspiral dynamics @xcite . in particular , we provide a distinct late - time waveform model , alternative to the common `` spectroscopic '' model @xcite based on sums of quasinormal mode overtones .",
    "we begin with some examples of gravitational strain waveforms as they might be observed by gravitational - wave instruments . in observational work , and pn analysis , it is customary to describe the radiation in terms of gravitational - wave strain , @xmath7 . in representing the strain , it is convenient to combine the two real waveform polarization components , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , into one complex strain waveform , @xmath10 we decompose the strain waveforms measured on a sphere of radius @xmath11 , into spin - weighted spherical harmonic components , @xmath12 .",
    "the details of the decomposition , and how the waveform information is extracted from the numerical simulations , are given in appendix  [ appendix : radiation ] .",
    "the waveforms in this section are aligned in time and phase so that the maximum strain amplitude occurs at @xmath13 .",
    "the remaining figures of this paper will be aligned in a similar way , but with @xmath13 marking the time of peak ( 2,2 ) mode energy flux , @xmath14 ( unless stated otherwise ) .",

    "the strain is measured at an azimuthal angle of @xmath23 and various inclinationsthe inclination angle is defined here as the angle between the line - of - sight with respect to the detector and the orbital axis of the binary .",
    "this is the same angle referred to as `` inclination '' in the pn / nr literature , and most equations are constructed using that definition .",
    "however , the astronomical literature has often defined inclination to be the angle between the line of sight and the orbital plane of the binary , resulting in a @xmath17 inconsistency . ] .",
    "the detailed shapes of the waveforms change as the system is reoriented so that the observer moves off the system s rotational axis . for larger inclinations ( closer to being viewed edge - on )",
    "there are notable modulations at half the base gravitational - wave frequency .",

    "[ fig : waveform_lm ] shows @xmath8 for different mass ratios oriented at an inclination of @xmath17 and an azimuthal angle of @xmath23 .",
    "for this orientation , @xmath8 constitutes the full strain waveform . for larger mass ratios , the lower frequency modulation increases .         for gravitational - wave observations of sufficiently strong binary black - hole sources , the types of differences shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : waveform_lm ] could be exploited to estimate the inclination and mass - ratio of the source system .    for observational purposes ,",
    "the combined waveform information encoding all possible source orientations can be conveniently represented in terms of spin - weighted spherical harmonic components [ see eqs.([eqn : psi4lm_def])-([eqn : hlm_def ] ) ] , providing a neat description of the leading waveform features , the multipolar decomposition is even more valuable as a tool for exposing the hallmark simplicity of the merger radiation .",
    "the readily apparent simplicity in the waves viewed from the system s orbital axis in fig .  [ fig : waves ] extends to each of the spherical harmonic components .",
    "viewed off axis , these components linearly combine to yield the more complex appearance of the waveforms in fig .",
    "[ fig : waveform_lm ] .",
    "this characterization of the gravitational radiation from a merging black - hole binary in terms of circular polarization was first recognized in the lazarus project studies @xcite . in this picture , the radiation can be represented by a slowly varying amplitude and a polarization angle ; see eq .",
    "( [ eqn : strain_modes ] ) below .",
    "this description relies on how the radiation appears to distant observers located on the rotational axis of the system .",
    "other observers will typically see elliptically polarized waves , having a generally simple pattern that conforms to the rotational nature of the source . in the equatorial plane",
    ", the radiation reduces to the plus polarization , corresponding to the observer seeing no circulation in the source . looking along the negative rotation axis",
    ", the observer sees circular polarization with the opposite helicity .",
    "each of the spherical harmonic waveform components exhibits circular polarization with steadily varying phase and amplitude , providing a natural framework for developing a practical and intuitive understanding of binary black - hole merger radiation . our basic waveform description , in sec .",
    "[ sec : description ] , and the more detailed analysis that follows , is based on this spherical harmonic decomposition .",
    "as we describe the waveforms , we will also suggest a heuristic interpretation of what the radiation tells us about the motion and structure of the binary black - hole source . in the weak - field description of radiation from a rotating object",
    ", the multipolar waveform components of the gravitational radiation can be associated with dynamics of multipolar moments of the radiating source @xcite .",
    "it is useful , in conceptualizing the full coalescence radiation from inspiral through merger and ringdown , to think of the multipolar radiation description as providing information about the motion of a changing source object , described as a sum of several multipolar mass moments .",
    "this source object is what we will interpret as an effective rigid rotator radiation source , with a slowly changing structure .",
    "we refer to this as the _ implicit rotating source _ ( irs ) .    in the process of coalescence ,",
    "the source begins as a separated black - hole binary system and ends as a single distorted black hole . for nonspinning binary mergers ,",
    "numerical and pn results consistently indicate that the radiation is circularly polarized , in the sense first recognized in the lazarus project studies @xcite , not only in the inspiral , but uniformly through the merger and ringdown . in our conceptual source description ,",
    "this pattern of circular polarization is consistent with radiation generated by rotational motion of each source multipolar moment , where the polarization phase is tied to the instantaneous orientation of the source .",
    "similarly , we think of the amplitude of the radiation multipole as related , through some generalization of the quadrupole formula , to the magnitude of the implicit source multipole",
    ".    we can write each multipolar component in a specific polar form natural for circularly polarized radiation : @xmath24",
    "each amplitude @xmath25 is expected to be a slowly varying function of time and can be conceptually considered as a function only of the magnitude of the source multipolar moment and its rotational frequency . the additional sign for some @xmath26 cases allows a consistent interpretation for the component phases and the component amplitudes .",
    "the waveform phase is given here by @xmath27 , but in most of our analysis we refer to @xmath28 , which we call the _",
    "rotational phase_. in our terms of our implicit source heuristic , the rotational phase for some particular @xmath29 mode can be thought of as the azimuthal orientation of the specified multipolar source component . in the inspiral , where the source can be considered as a separated binary ,",
    "@xmath28 should coincide with the orbital phase , independent of @xmath29 . in the post - newtonian expansion @xcite ,",
    "all the @xmath28 defined here agree to at least 2pn order , while the amplitudes @xmath25 remain real and non - negative .",
    "the equatorial - plane symmetry of these mergers ensures that @xmath30 and that @xmath31 , so that we need consider only @xmath32 modes for this analysis .",
    "the expansion ( [ eqn : strain_modes ] ) is not appropriate for the @xmath33 modes .",
    "this points to an important caveat to our implicit rotating source interpretation of the radiation , that it applies to the degree that the radiation is circularly polarized .",
    "while not strictly vanishing , the @xmath33 waveform components , and other deviations from circular polarization are generally extremely small , and largely unmeasurable at the resolutions of the simulations we study . for the most part",
    ", we will not address deviations from circular polarization , and the consequent limitations of our implicit - rotating - source interpretation in this paper , focusing for now on the dominant features of the radiation .",
    "our analysis is based on four simulations , representing mass ratios 1:1 , 2:1 , 4:1 and 6:1 .",
    "results from the 1:1 and 4:1 simulations have appeared in previous publications ( @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "more recently , higher accuracy simulations have been presented by other groups for the 1:1 case @xcite .",
    "our older waveform is sufficiently accurate for our present purpose , to examine the general features of the nonspinning merger waveforms .",
    "our numerical simulations are carried out with the hahndol evolution code @xcite , which uses finite - differencing methods to solve a 3 + 1 formulation of einstein s equations on a cartesian grid . for initial data we solve the elliptic equation given by brandt and brgmann for conformally flat data in which the black holes are represented by punctures @xcite .",
    "this is performed numerically using the multigrid solver amrmg @xcite , which is second - order - accurate but tuned to give truncation errors typically much smaller than those produced by the evolution code .",
    "the momentum parameters are chosen according to the 2pn - accurate quasicircular approximation given by kidder @xcite , which has been found to result in low eccentricity .",
    "we evolve these data using the moving puncture method @xcite with a modified version of the baumgarte - shapiro - shibata - nakamura equations @xcite .",
    "specifically , as suggested in @xcite , we replaced the conformal factor variable @xmath34 with @xmath35 , which vanishes at the punctures .",
    "further , we added the constraint - damping terms suggested in @xcite , and the dissipation terms suggested in @xcite . for the gauge we use the specific 1+log lapse and gamma - freezing shift conditions recommended for moving punctures in @xcite .",
    "accurate simulations require adequate spatial resolution near the black holes ( length scales @xmath36 ) as well as in the wave zone where the gravitational waves are extracted ( length scales @xmath37 ) . to this end ,",
    "the grid has multiple refinement levels , determined adaptively near the black holes , but fixed in regions farther away ( typically , @xmath38 ) where the waves are extracted ; all grid refinement is handled within the framework of the software package paramesh @xcite .",
    "the adaptive mesh refinement criterion near the black holes is designed to keep the scale of the square root of an invariantly defined curvature component , known as the coulomb scalar @xcite , roughly constant with respect to the grid spacing .",
    "interpolation in guard - cells between refinement regions is fifth - order - accurate , coupling with differencing stencils to yield at least fourth - order accuracy in the bulk .",
    "spatial derivatives are taken by sixth - order - accurate differencing stencils , with the exception of advection derivatives , which are handled by fifth - order - accurate mesh - adapted differencing for greater stability @xcite .",
    "time integration is performed with a fourth - order runge - kutta algorithm .",
    "the initial configurations of the simulations we analyze are given in table  [ table : rundata ] .",
    "in each case , the initial separation was chosen to be large enough to result in at least five orbits .",
    "the finest resolution , @xmath39 , ranged from @xmath40 to @xmath41 , as required to adequately resolve the black hole with the smaller mass in each case .",
    "the outer boundary was typically at @xmath42 , far enough away to prevent reflections from reaching the wave - extraction region during the simulation .",
    "it is instructive to compare these values with recent predictions for the final mass and spin from analytic and numerical methods . working with a subset of the data supplied here , and also invoking the test - mass limit ,",
    "@xcite suggest the one - parameter fits : @xmath43 the numerical data from table  [ tab : kerrparams ] also fits well the wholly numerical formula ( 3.17a ) from @xcite , as well as the parametrized formula of @xcite .",
    "we note that when discussing the mass @xmath44 of the end - state kerr hole in secs .",
    "[ ssec : transfreq ] and later , we have consistently taken the radiation - derived value , @xmath45 , as results from @xcite indicate this has errors up to a factor of 3 less than qnm - based mass .",
    "since a far larger proportion of the initial angular momentum than mass is emitted during the inspiral and merger , there is greater uncertainty in the radiation - derived final spin than the final mass .",
    "for this reason , our preferred measure of the final dimensionless spin is the qnm - derived value @xmath46 ."
