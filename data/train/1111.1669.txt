    "methanol is a simple example of an amphiphilic organic solute , and its aqueous solutions exhibit many interesting nonidealities . attaining a good understanding of this simple case is therefore a natural starting point for studies of more complex solutes in water , such as higher alcohols or proteins .    because of the increasing availability of expanded computing power",

    "@xcite found that the jagla solvent exhibits key water - like characteristics with respect to hydrophobic hydration , suggesting that the water - like characteristics of the jagla solvent extend beyond the pure fluid . here , we explore this analogy further , considering the properties of solutions of amphipathic solutes .",
    "we focus on the properties of the excess volume and the excess enthalpy , and on how amphiphilic solutes affect the temperature of maximum density ( @xmath2 ) of a solution . at @xmath3k and @xmath4mpa the excess volume and",

    "the strongest effect occurs at a methanol volume fraction of @xmath5% , at which the negative excess volume deviates from additivity by @xmath6% @xcite . as @xmath7 increases and @xmath8 decreases , the excess volume becomes more negative and the extremal point shifts ( see fig .  [ temperatureexperiment ] and fig .",

    "most solutes tend to suppress water s non - idealities , and hence they lower the @xmath2 .",
    "some amphiphilic solutes behave differently : ethanol and t - butanol have a marked non - monotonic effect ( whereby the @xmath2 of the solution first increases with respect to that of water upon solute addition , but decreases for more concentrated solutions ) , and methanol has a very mild non - monotonic effect @xcite .    as a first step , in this paper ,",
    "our goal is to model a simple amphiphilic solution that mimics the properties of the methanol - water system .",
    "we use a hard sphere with parameterized diameter @xmath9 to model the hydrophobic methyl group , and a jagla particle to model the hydrophilic hydroxyl group .",
    "we link the hard sphere and the jagla particle using a bond of adjustable length to model the amphiphilic solutes .    in section ii of this paper we describe in detail our models and simulation methods . in section",

    "however , for this value of @xmath25 we can not reproduce the experimentally - observed maximum reduction volume fraction .",
    "we next show , in fig .",
    "[ dimerbond ] , how bond length affects the excess volume .",
    "we choose three different hard sphere diameters and vary the bond length . for @xmath85 [ fig .",

    "in addition , over the entire range of volume fractions the excess volume agrees quantitatively with experiment for these two sets of parameters .    in the dimer model",
    ", we achieve the closest agreement with the experimental data at @xmath87 and @xmath92 . at this set of parameters , the hard sphere and the jagla particle nearly overlap .",

    "the maximum reduction volume fraction is close to the experimental data , and in the range of volume fractions smaller than the maximum reduction volume fraction , the excess volume is also quantitatively reproduced .",
    "overall , the monomer model can reproduce the excess volume curve qualitatively but is not as accurate as the dimer model .    at @xmath3k and @xmath4  mpa ,",

    "we have explored the relative density of the neat amphiphilic solutes with respect to a pure jagla solvent when we change the parameters .",
    "the density increases when we shorten the bond length , when the diameter of the hard sphere @xmath9 in the dimer model decreases , and when the hard core of the monomer @xmath9 decreases . from the above - discussed results we know that when @xmath87 and @xmath92 , we achieve the best agreement between our simulation results and the experimental results .",
