    "the seesaw mechanism @xcite provides a simple means for generating naturally light standard model ( sm ) neutrinos .",
    "this simplicity , however , comes at a cost .",
    "if the dirac yukawa couplings in the neutrino sector are large [ e.g.  ] , as argued on the basis of naturalness , the gauge - singlet neutrinos must be very heavy , and there is essentially no hope of experimentally producing them .",
    "thus , if the seesaw is realized naturally in nature , the origin of neutrino mass will remain a mystery for the foreseeable future .    beyond the seesaw mechanism , however ,",
    "there exist alternative approaches capable of explaining neutrino mass ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . for example , light neutrinos can be realized naturally without invoking new high - energy physics if the right - handed neutrinos are low - energy composites of a confining hidden sector  @xcite . in principle",
    ", such models are easier to experimentally verify than a high - energy seesaw . in practice , models with light new physics can be similarly difficult to probe , due to very weak couplings .",
    "indirect signals like flavor changing decays  @xcite , cmb signals  @xcite , or galactic x - ray signals  @xcite , often provide the best way to probe such scenarios .",
    "this is more promising than the somewhat bleak outlook afforded by the canonical seesaw , though it would be preferable if the new physics associated with neutrino mass was amenable to direct experimental production .",
    "the likelihood of discovering new - physics related to neutrino mass increases if it includes new tev - scale particles that are charged under the sm .",
    "radiative models of neutrino mass provide a good example ; here the sm couples to new fields that can potentially be probed at the lhc , while neutrino mass is generated as a small loop - effect  @xcite .",
    "these models are very promising from an experimental point of view , as the connection between small masses and new tev - scale physics offers perhaps the best hope of discovery ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .    with this in mind , it is worthwhile considering exotic states with masses that have gauge invariant , renormalizable couplings to sm fermions .",
    "as one may expect , not many such candidates exist  @xcite , and most of those suitable for generating neutrino mass have been studied extensively .",
    "an interesting exception are the exotic leptons @xmath1 , which form an su@xmath2 triplet with hypercharge @xmath3 .",
    "triplet in the type iii seesaw @xcite . ] despite comprising a modest ( and testable ) extension of the sm , these states have been largely neglected in the literature .",
    "fortunately this deficiency was recently rectified ; discovery prospects at the lhc were analyzed in  @xcite , and their low - energy phenomenology was studied in  @xcite .",
    "further studies were subsequently performed by @xcite .",
    "the phenomenology of these exotics was somewhat interesting  they can induce tree - level modifications to flavor - changing currents , leading to non - unitary mixing effects in weak interactions , and lepton flavor violation  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the collider signatures of the doubly - charged lepton @xmath4 are very distinctive  @xcite . also predicts a doubly charged lepton @xcite , but its phenomenology is markedly different . for related work",
    "see  @xcite . ]",
    "given that current bounds permit these exotics to be discovered at the lhc  @xcite , it is worth asking if they could enable new mechanisms for generating neutrino mass .",
    "we investigate this matter in the present work , finding that new approaches can arise .",
    "in particular , the resulting neutral - lepton mass matrix is suggestive of an inverse seesaw mechanism  @xcite , and we present simple models that achieve a ( non - standard ) radiative inverse seesaw  @xcite .",
    "these models allow one to realize small neutrino masses without invoking tiny parameters , and permit the new physics to appear at the tev scale .",
    "furthermore , the models contain remnant low - energy symmetries that ensures the stability of a new dark matter candidate  an unintended but welcome consequence .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows .",
    "we briefly discuss the exotic leptons and elucidate why they are suggestive of an inverse seesaw in sec .",
    "[ sec : nu_mass_with_exotics ] .",
    "simple models that achieve a radiative inverse seesaw are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : radiative_iss ] .",
    "conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] and additional pertinent details appear in an appendix .",
    "we extend the sm to include the exotic triplets @xmath5 , which transform under @xmath6 as e_r , l = _ r , l ~(1,3,-1 ) .",
    "the gauge invariant lagrangian thus includes the terms - y_e _ le_r - m_e _",
    "l e_r + , where @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) is the sm lepton ( higgs ) doublet . for a given value of @xmath9 , the yukawa couplings @xmath10 are constrained by @xmath11 decays and lepton flavor violation  @xcite .",
    "we are interested in @xmath12  tev , in which case the matrix elements must satisfy  @xcite ( y_e)_ii 1(y_e)_ij 10 ^ -2  ij , barring tuned cancellations .    with this minimal anomaly - free extension ,",
    "the neutral lepton mass matrix is _",
    "^e= , [ exotic_mass_matrix ] in the basis @xmath13 .",
    "this matrix conserves lepton number symmetry , and one obtains a heavy dirac neutrino and a massless ( mostly sm ) neutrino per generation . as a result , additional ingredients are required to generate nonzero sm neutrino masses .",
    "note , however , that the matrix is suggestive of two familiar forms in the literature  namely those of the double seesaw mechanism ( see e.g.  @xcite ) and the inverse seesaw mechanism  @xcite .",
    "the former approach is unsuitable in the present context as it requires one to break the electroweak symmetry at a scale @xmath14  tev .",
    "thus we are led to consider an inverse seesaw .",
    "let us briefly summarize the main features of this approach .",
    "the canonical inverse seesaw requires one to add a four - component singlet fermion @xmath15 ( per family ) to the sm .",
    "consequently , in the basis @xmath16,@xmath17 , the mass matrix has the form _ = , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are dirac masses while @xmath20 are ( bare ) majorana masses .",
    "a field - redefinition freedom ensures that the @xmath21 entry can be set to zero .",
    "when @xmath22 , lepton number symmetry is explicitly broken and all three fields acquire mass .",
    "the inverse seesaw occurs in the technically - natural limit of @xmath23 , for which the eigenvalues are @xmath24 observe that the light neutrino mass ( i.e. @xmath25 ) is suppressed by the smallness of @xmath26 , with further suppression if @xmath27 .",
    "an interesting feature of this scheme is that it allows significant mixing between @xmath28 and @xmath29 , namely @xmath30 . for @xmath31",
    "0.1  ev and @xmath32  30  kev ( compatible with the new physics @xmath19 being at the tev scale ) , this mixing is @xmath33 and non - unitary mixing effects may be detectable in future experiments  @xcite .",
    "note that the mixing between @xmath28 and @xmath34 is at the level of @xmath35 and remains negligible .",
    "for our purposes , the key point to note is that when the small parameters vanish ( @xmath36 ) , the mass matrix reduces to that obtained with exotic leptons in .",
    "this suggests that @xmath20 are small because they are zero at tree - level , and that @xmath37 is generated radiatively by new physics that communicates with @xmath38 .",
    "this would , in turn , lead to small sm neutrino masses via a radiative inverse seesaw . in the following section we present simple models that realize this idea .",
    "we wish to generate small values of @xmath20 to enable an inverse seesaw mechanism involving the triplets @xmath5 . to this end , we consider models that radiatively generate nonzero @xmath20 . to obtain the terms @xmath39 , with @xmath40 .",
    "however , @xmath41 produces a goldstone mode , and tuning is required to obtain @xmath42 neutrino masses when the new physics is @xmath43 . ]",
    "we present two such models ; one employing an extended gauge symmetry , and another with a global @xmath44 symmetry .",
    "nonzero @xmath20 can be generated radiatively by introducing new particles that are charged under a hidden ( or `` dark '' ) gauge symmetry .",
    "we consider the extended gauge group @xmath45 , with new fields that transform as & & e_r , l ~(1,3,-1)(0 ) , n_r , l ~(1,1,0)(d ) , + & & ~(1,3,-1)(-d ) , ~(1,1,0)(d ) , ~(1,1,0)(2d).here the first ( second ) line contains exotic fermions ( scalars ) , and @xmath46 is an arbitrary charge that can be set to unity . these particles , together with the sm fields ( which are u@xmath47 singlets ) , form an anomaly - free set .",
    "in addition to , the lagrangian contains the terms @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are yukawa couplings .",
    "suppose that our model building choices enforce the following vev pattern 174 , , = 0 , 0 .",
    "then , in the basis @xmath13 , the tree - level mass matrix has the form with a conserved lepton - number symmetry .",
    "in addition , the @xmath51 mass matrix for the `` dark '' neutrinos @xmath52 decouples , and the associated mass eigenstates are two ( majorana ) linear combinations of @xmath52 . these dark neutrinos do not mix with the other fields  a statement that holds to all orders in perturbation theory , as we explain below .",
    "the most general scalar potential is @xmath53   + ( \\eta^\\dagger\\eta)\\left[\\mu_\\eta^2         + \\lambda_{\\eta}(\\eta^\\dagger\\eta )           + \\lambda_{\\eta\\chi}(\\chi^\\dagger\\chi ) \\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & \\;\\;+(\\xi^\\dagger\\xi)\\left[\\mu_\\xi^2 + \\lambda_{\\xi}(\\xi^\\dagger\\xi )        + \\lambda_{\\xi\\eta}(\\eta^\\dagger\\eta )           + \\lambda_{\\xi\\chi}(\\chi^\\dagger\\chi ) \\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & \\;\\ ; + ( \\chi^\\dagger\\chi)\\left[\\mu_\\chi^2            + \\lambda_{\\chi}(\\chi^\\dagger\\chi )     \\right]\\nonumber\\\\     & \\;\\ ; + \\left[\\lambda_{\\xi\\phi\\eta}\\ , \\xi\\phi\\phi\\eta       + \\frac{1}{2}\\mu_{\\eta\\chi}\\ , \\eta\\eta\\chi^\\dagger       + \\text{h.c.}\\right].\\label{eqn : v_s_all}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] observe that lepton number symmetry is broken explicitly in the last line . as a result , one expects the majorana masses @xmath20 to be generated radiatively .",
    "indeed , @xmath26 is generated via the one - loop dim-9 diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig:1loopdim9 ] . the corresponding diagram for @xmath54",
    "is obtained with appropriate mass insertions .    .",
    "note that @xmath54 is obtained via @xmath9 mass insertions at both ends . ]",
    "writing the scale of new physics as @xmath55 ( the masses for @xmath56 respectively ) , the one - loop majorana mass is approximately _",
    "l - _ . for @xmath57  1",

    "hence , there is no severe tuning and small neutrino masses are compatible with the new physics appearing at the tev scale .",
    "mass term .",
    "we show in the appendix that this does not affect our conclusions .",
    "there is also a two - loop dim-7 diagram for @xmath20 , but this is subdominant when the new states are @xmath43 ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : sec : z4_symmetry ] ) . ]",
    "note that the vev pattern in ( [ eqn : vev_pattern ] ) is easily achieved .",
    "a small hierarchy between and @xmath64 is obtained provided the mixing term @xmath65 is not too large . the requirement that @xmath66 is also compatible with @xmath67 , as long as all couplings involving @xmath68 and @xmath69 in @xmath70 are positive .",
    "the stability of the classical vacua may be affected by radiative corrections , including fermion loops induced by @xmath71 . however , for a given set of classical parameters that achieve ( [ eqn : vev_pattern ] ) , one can always select a suitable cut - off to ensure this minimum persists at the quantum level .",
    "if needed , one can also reduce @xmath72 to allow larger values of the cut - off .",
    "smaller values of @xmath73 help to suppress @xmath26 , so smaller @xmath74 can be used . since @xmath68 is charged under @xmath75",
    ", one might naively worry about the sm @xmath76-parameter .",
    "however , we require @xmath77 , so there are no tree - level corrections to the sm value and the model lies safely within experimental limits .",
    "note that symmetry breaking induces mass mixing between @xmath78 and @xmath79 , providing a channel for communication between the sm and the hidden sector .",
    "there is also mixing between @xmath68 and @xmath69 , though these scalars do not mix with @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the hidden sector will also communicate with the sm via gauge kinetic - mixing  @xcite between u@xmath47 and hypercharge .",
    "the mixing term in the lagrangian is - ( _ w f_-_w z _ ) z_d^ , where @xmath80 is the weak mixing angle , and",
    "the mixing parameter obeys @xmath81 ( see below ) . to leading order in @xmath82",
    ", the mixed kinetic - lagrangian is diagonalized by the following field redefinitions : @xmath83 in this basis , the mass terms for @xmath11 and @xmath84 are m_z^2z^2 + _ w m_z^2 z z_d + m_z_d^2 z_d^2 . hence , to this order , the @xmath11-@xmath84 mixing angle is _ d _ w ( ) , which is suppressed by both small @xmath82 and the mass ratio @xmath85 .",
    "the corresponding mass eigenvalues are @xmath86 $ ] and @xmath87 $ ] . with these results ,",
    "one obtains the coupling between the _ physical _ massive vectors and matter : - z^ _ - z_d^_,where @xmath88 is the sm hypercharge current .",
    "thus , the dominant effect of the kinetic mixing is to induce a small coupling of @xmath84 to @xmath88 when @xmath89 .    in addition",
    "to collider signals due to the triplets @xmath38 , the new vector @xmath84 can produce observable effects .",
    "detailed phenomenological studies of a hidden vector with mass @xmath90  gev have appeared in the literature  @xcite . in the present model , when @xmath84 and @xmath78 are the lightest exotic states , the constraints on @xmath82 are similar to those obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite : || 0.006 ( ) .",
    "clearly , @xmath91 is necessary for @xmath92 , though the constraint is compatible with @xmath82 being generated at the one - loop level .    once produced in a collider",
    ", the hidden vector can decay back to sm fermions .",
    "these decays proceed through the kinetic mixing , and in the limit @xmath93 the widths are m_z_d . here",
    "@xmath94 is the fine - structure constant , @xmath95 is the hypercharge value , and @xmath96 is the color factor . notice the distinctive hypercharge dependence , which ensures that the branching fractions to sm fermions are approximately set by @xmath97 $ ] .",
    "summing over kinematically available final states ( including @xmath98 ) gives  @xcite _ z_d0.2 ( ) ( ) .",
    "the @xmath99 suppression forces the width to be rather narrow , but discovery remains possible in regions of parameter space  @xcite .    finally , let us point out another welcome feature of the model  namely the existence of a stable dark matter candidate .",
    "note that when @xmath78 develops a nonzero vev , the u@xmath47 symmetry is broken to a residual @xmath100 . since @xmath66 , this symmetry , whose action is defined by \\{n_r , l , , } -\\{n_r , l , , } , _ _ , remains as an exact ( accidental ) symmetry of the low - energy lagrangian .",
    "this prevents @xmath101 from mixing with the other leptons , as aforementioned .",
    "furthermore , it forces the lightest particle among @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath69 to be absolutely stable , ensuring a dark matter candidate . since neutrino masses can be generated with couplings as large as @xmath103 , it is trivial to obtain the correct dark matter abundance via freeze - out with @xmath104 .",
    "the dark matter is therefore a standard wimp whose stability is related to the origin of neutrino mass ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the charged components of @xmath68 also transform non - trivially in .",
    "thus , one must ensure that @xmath105 and @xmath106 can decay in order to avoid having a ( cosmologically excluded ) stable charged particle .",
    "this is easy to achieve .",
    "for example , if the dark matter candidate is the lightest linear - combination of @xmath52 , the decay @xmath107 is allowed provided @xmath108 .",
    "similarly , if @xmath78 is the dark matter candidate , decays like @xmath109 can be allowed.-@xmath110 mixing as a mass insertion , the components of @xmath68 are degenerate at the classical level .",
    "loop corrections are expected to lift this degeneracy .",
    "if the radiative splittings make the charged components heavier , decays like @xmath111 would also occur ( the @xmath112 could be off - shell ) . ]",
    "note that the phenomenology of @xmath84 also depends on the mass spectrum of the exotics .",
    "for instance , when the dark matter candidate is the lightest linear - combination of @xmath101 , the invisible decay @xmath113 may occur .",
    "the width for this decay is @xmath114 , which is expected to dominate the sm width in ( [ eqn : zd_partial_width ] ) , given the @xmath99 suppression of the latter .",
    "consequently , @xmath84 decays produce missing energy signals in this case .",
    "we have seen that a simple gauge extension of the sm allows one to generate sm neutrino masses via the exotic leptons @xmath5 . in this subsection",
    "we briefly show that a related radiative inverse seesaw can occur in models with a discrete symmetry .",
    "specifically , we consider a global @xmath44 symmetry , with exotic fields that transform under @xmath115 as & & e_r , l ~(1,3,-1)(1 ) , n_r ~(1,1,0)(i),[eqna : ex_leptons_z4 ] + & & ~(1,3,-1)(-i ) , ~(1,1,0)(i ) , ~(1,1,0)(-1).as before , @xmath5 and @xmath116 are fermions , while @xmath117 and @xmath78 are scalars .",
    "all sm particles are neutral under @xmath44 .",
    "note that the chiral state @xmath118 is no longer required , as the leptons in ( [ eqna : ex_leptons_z4 ] ) , together with the sm fermions , form an anomaly - free set . as a result",
    ", the interaction lagrangian does not contain the @xmath118-terms shown in ( [ eqn : new_terms_u1d ] ) but is otherwise identical .",
    "the scalar potential remains as in ( [ eqn : v_s_all ] ) , with lepton number symmetry broken explicitly , so one expects nonzero @xmath20 to be generated radiatively .",
    "in addition to the change in particle content , we consider the following vev pattern 174  , , , = 0 .",
    "observe that the @xmath44-charged scalars have vanishing vevs so the discrete symmetry remains intact .",
    "this prevents any mixing between @xmath116 and the other leptons .",
    "it also forbids the one - loop diagram for @xmath26 in fig .",
    "[ fig:1loopdim9 ] .",
    "however , nonzero @xmath26 is generated at the two - loop level by the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig:2loopdim7 ] .    in the simplifying limit @xmath119 , where @xmath74 is the ( approximate ) common mass of the other exotics , one gets _",

    "thus , one readily obtains suitable light neutrino masses for natural parameters .    .",
    "@xmath54 is obtained via @xmath9 mass insertions at both ends . ]",
    "unsurprisingly , the exact @xmath44 symmetry ensures that the lightest @xmath44-charged state is a stable dark matter candidate .",
    "distinct from the @xmath120 model , however , one can now have a multi - component dark matter scenario .",
    "for example , if @xmath78 is the lightest @xmath44-charged state , then the lightest field out of @xmath69 , @xmath68 and @xmath116 is also stable .",
    "similarly , if either of @xmath69 , @xmath68 or @xmath116 are the lightest @xmath44-charged state , then @xmath78 is also stable if @xmath121 ( @xmath122 being the mass of the lightest dark matter candidate ) .",

    "<S> we show that models with exotic leptons transforming as @xmath0 under the standard model gauge symmetry are well suited for generating neutrino mass via a radiative inverse seesaw . </S>",
    "<S> this approach realizes natural neutrino masses and allows multiple new states to appear at the tev scale . </S>",
    "<S> the exotic leptons are therefore good candidates for new physics that can be probed at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , remnant low - energy symmetries ensure a stable dark matter candidate , providing a link between dark matter and the origins of neutrino mass . </S>"
