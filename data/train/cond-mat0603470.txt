    "this behavior is also affected by the difference of the bandwidths .",
    "in fact , the difference of the bandwidths suppresses orbital fluctuations , making the first - order transition unstable . as a consequence , the double second - order transitions occur , where the osmi phase appears between the metallic and the mott insulating phase .",
    "our obtained results reproduce some previous works on the system with same and different bandwidths .",
    "@xcite furthermore , taking into account of orbital fluctuations carefully , we have resolved some controversial conclusions for the nature of mott transitions at half - filling .",
    "we would like to thank s. suga , n. kawakami , m. sigrist , t. m. rice and a. liebsch for valuable discussions .",
    "numerical computations were carried out at the supercomputer center , the institute for solid state physics , university of tokyo . this work was supported by a grant - in - aid for scientific research from the ministry of education , culture , sports , science , and technology , japan ."
