    "positivity of determinants ( or minors ) of collocation matrices is an important property in approximation theory .",

    "positivity of principal minors , or even total positivity is used in the proofs of some well - known results , see @xcite , e.g.    recently , nonsingularity and principal minors of such matrices for polynomial interpolation at padua - like points and for interpolation by bivariate bzier patches were studied in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a related problem is a construction or an approximation of fekete points for a given domain , i.e. , the interpolation points , which yield the maximal absolute value of the vandermonde determinant @xcite .",
    "it is a well known fact that bivariate bernstein polynomials @xmath2 of degree @xmath3 form a basis of the space of bivariate polynomials of degree @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath5 .",

    "@xmath7 expressed in barycentric coordinates with respect to a given triangle @xmath8 .",
    "thus the corresponding interpolation matrix @xmath9_{\\xi \\in \\mathcal d_{d , t},\\,\\eta \\in \\mathcal{i}_d}$ ] is nonsingular . in @xcite",
    ", a theorem was stated that by choosing an arbitrary nonempty subset @xmath10 and the corresponding set of indices @xmath11 , the submatrix @xmath12_{\\xi \\in \\mathcal{j},\\,\\eta \\in \\gamma}$ ] is nonsingular for all @xmath13 , and furthermore , @xmath14 .",
    "the authors of @xcite verified the theorem by computer and provided a proof of nonsingularity of principal matrices for some special configurations of domain points . for more details",
    "see @xcite .",
    "a straightforward way of verifying the conjecture by computing principal minors of @xmath0 is time consuming due to the exponential growth of the number of subsets that need to be analysed , and can not be done for @xmath15 using current computational facilities .",
    "matrices with positive principal minors are known as p - matrices .",
    "much on them is known , see @xcite , e.g. unfortunately , those tools could not be applied for the study of the problem at hand , so a different approach will be used .    in this paper , the conjecture on positivity of determinant of the bivariate bzier collocation matrix @xmath0 is confirmed .",
    "furthermore , the result is proven for an arbitrary @xmath16 for @xmath17 .",
    "thus the constrained lagrange interpolation problem has an unique solution .",
    "this covers all the cases useful in practice , since it is well known that lagrange polynomial interpolants of high degrees have undesired properties .",
    "some particular configurations of domain points are analysed .",

    "[ fig : slika2 ] .",
    "the conjecture is important for interpolation with spline functions , since some degrees of freedom are determined through the smoothness conditions and the rest through the interpolation conditions ( see @xcite , e.g. ) .",
    "note that the matrix @xmath43 is not symmetric .",
    "the determinant of @xmath43 is independent of the ordering of elements of @xmath11 as long as the same ordering for rows and columns is used .",
    "it is common to use the counter - lexicographical ordering @xmath44 , @xmath45 but a particular ordering of elements in @xmath24 , which yields a block lower triangular matrix @xmath46 ( see @xcite ) , will be more convenient .",

    "the ordering @xmath47 implies that the matrix @xmath46 has a structure @xmath53,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54,\\\\ & m_{\\mathcal i_d^{(1)}}= \\left [ \\begin{array}{ccc } m_{\\epsilon } & & \\\\ & m_{\\epsilon } & \\\\ & & m_{\\epsilon } \\end{array } \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath55 .",
    "thus the problem of verifying the positivity of principal minors of the matrix @xmath46 is reduced to each diagonal block matrix separately .",
    "the matrix @xmath56 is an univariate bzier collocation matrix and by @xcite it is totally non - negative with positive principal minors .",
    "therefore , the problem reduces to the study of a @xmath57 matrix @xmath58 , which , unfortunately , represents a very large part of the matrix @xmath46 for a large @xmath3 .",
    "let us simplify the considered matrix .",
    "let us construct a matrix @xmath59 from @xmath43 in the following way :    * for every column , divide each element , that corresponds to a polynomial @xmath60 , by @xmath61 , * multiply the obtained matrix by @xmath62 .",
    "thus an element @xmath63 is transformed into @xmath64 .",
    "therefore @xmath65    clearly , the matrix @xmath59 is a principal submatrix of @xmath66 . since @xmath67 , conjecture [ conj : main ] holds for @xmath43 iff it holds for @xmath59 .",
    "the matrix @xmath59 has some nice properties .",
    "it consists only of non - negative integers , thus determinant computations are exact .",
    "the matrix @xmath66 has a simpler structure than @xmath46 and is closely related to combinatorial objects .",
    "therefore some properties of the matrix @xmath46 will be proven via @xmath66 .",
