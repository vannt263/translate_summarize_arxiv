    "the magnetotail is affected by various perturbations originating from the environment it is surrounded by .",
    "such perturbations can be transported by fms waves across the magnetotail from areas of their origin .",
    "fms waves deep in the magnetotail are mode converted into alfven waves , with the perturbation energy being further transferred along the magnetic field by alfven waves as disturbances of various spatial scales @xcite . when fms waves are mode converted into alfven waves , accelerated plasma flows are formed @xcite ; such flows can reach the surface of the planet .",
    "the alfven waves cause magnetic field perturbations and electron precipitations due to their longitudinal electric field @xcite .",
    "thus , fms waves of the magnetotail are not only of interest as themselves but also in relation to the wide range of diverse phenomena resulting from their mode conversion into alfven waves .    up until now",
    "the magnetotail fms modes have been studied in very simple models only - either a cylindrical model without plasma sheet @xcite , or a flat model @xcite . despite their simplicity",
    ", these models help capture some of the general features in fms wave propagation in the magnetotail .",
    "the first of the two includes reflection of fms waves propagating deep into the tail , while the second model reflects the existence of an fms waveguide in the plasma sheet due to a strong inhomogeneity of the magnetotail parameters in the direction across the magnetotail .",
    "these results are , however , obtained in two different models , and either model is clearly not satisfactory . in this paper",
    "we address fms modes in a model magnetotail taking into account both the nearly cylindrical shape of the magnetotail and the plasma sheet within .",
    "the current sheet , with strongly attenuating magnetic field inside , manifests itself as a strong inhomogeneity of the alfven velocity , in the fms wave equations .",
    "since the dispersion properties of fms waves in the area of existence of the current sheet are determined by the sound velocity , whereas the value of the low alfven speed is insignificant , we neglect the presence of the current sheet and confine ourselves to including only the plasma sheet in the model .",
    "we introduce a special orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system which generalizes the radial and azimuthal cylindrical coordinates for magnetotail cross - section .",
    "the boundary of the plasma sheet and lobes lies on the coordinate curves in this coordinate system . in this case",
    "it is possible to reduce the problem of describing the fms modes to an ordinary second - order differential equation by using the `` radial '' wkb approximation .",
    "together with the boundary conditions on the `` azimuthal '' coordinate , it gives a dispersion equation that determines the wave `` radial '' numbers as functions of `` radial '' coordinate .",
    "we assume that the magnetotail is a plasma column extended along the direction of magnetic field @xmath0 ; this direction is chosen as the @xmath1 coordinate of the cartesian coordinate system .",
    "all unperturbed plasma parameters and the magnetic field are homogeneous with respect to this coordinate .",
    "the homogeneity of the unperturbed parameters on @xmath1 lets us consider a fourier harmonic of the wave perturbation corresponding to this coordinate , i.e. suppose that the perturbation is the product of functions @xmath2 and @xmath3 by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the longitudinal wave number",
