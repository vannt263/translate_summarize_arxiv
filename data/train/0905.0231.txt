    "within the standard model of elementary particle physics ( sm ) there are six flavors of quarks , six flavors of leptons , and four vector gauge bosons , with a hierarchy of couplings and masses .",
    "the fermilab tevatron , with a center - of - mass energy of 1.96 tev , can produce all of the known quarks and vector bosons .",
    "over the course of years of data - taking using the cdf detector  @xcite , we have developed a suite of largely data - driven methods by which we estimate the efficiencies and backgrounds associated with the identification of charged leptons , heavy flavor quarks ( @xmath0 or @xmath11 quark ) , electroweak gauge bosons ( photon , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 ) , and the presence of neutrinos , identified generically by missing transverse energy ( @xmath1 )  @xcite .",
    "the ability to identify these ` objects ' in events and to estimate their efficiencies and backgrounds has led to the development of signature - based searches at the tevatron , in which one defines _ a priori _ the objects an event is required to contain , and then compares observations to expectations  @xcite .",
    "the model tested in these searches is the sm , which is predictive and falsifiable ; any deviation from the sm predictions would be a signal of new phenomena .",
    "the advantage of this strategy is that only once such a signal has been established would the investment be made in generating detailed predictions of the many possible models for the new phenomena .",
    "we describe here a search for new physics in the inclusive @xmath14 channel using @xmath15 @xmath3 of integrated luminosity at a center - of - mass energy of @xmath5 tev , collected between february 2002 and may 2007 .",
    "a similar search was originally performed in run i using @xmath16 @xmath17 of integrated luminosity  @xcite .",
    "our search in run ii is part of a broad effort at cdf to study rare event signatures involving photons for any non - sm sources  @xcite .",
    "the sm processes , either with a radiated photon or where the charged lepton is misidentified as a photon , are expected to contribute @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) and @xmath20 ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) to the measured rate  @xcite .",
    "because the sm contributions to the @xmath14 final state are highly suppressed , for an ideal detector the signature provides an excellent place to look for new phenomena . in reality",
    ", we expect additional events from processes such as @xmath23 + jets and @xmath24 production in which mismeasurements of the jet energy induce @xmath1 .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : detector ] briefly describes the cdf ii detector .",

    "section  [ sec : conclusions ] presents the conclusions .",
    "the cdf ii detector is a cylindrically - symmetric spectrometer designed to study @xmath25 collisions at the fermilab tevatron .",
    "the detector has been extensively described in detail in the literature  @xcite . here",
    "we briefly describe the detector subsystems relevant for the analysis .",
    "tracking systems are used to measure the momenta of charged particles , to reconstruct primary and secondary vertices , and to trigger on and identify leptons with large transverse momentum  @xcite .",
    "silicon strip detectors  @xcite and the central outer tracker ( cot )  @xcite are contained in a superconducting solenoid that generates a magnetic field of 1.4  t. the silicon strip system provides up to 8 measurements in the @xmath26 and @xmath27 views  @xcite and covers the track reconstruction in the region @xmath28 2 .",
    "the cot is an open - cell drift chamber that makes up to 96 measurements along the track of each charged particle in the region @xmath29 .",
    "sense wires are arranged in 8 alternating axial and @xmath30 stereo super - layers .",
    "the resolution in @xmath31 , @xmath32 , is @xmath33 for tracks with only cot measurements , and @xmath34 for tracks with both the silicon and cot measurements .",
    "calorimeters are segmented with towers arranged in a projective geometry .",
    "each tower consists of an electromagnetic and a hadronic compartment  @xcite , covering the central region , @xmath35 and the ` end plug ' region , @xmath36 .",
    "the central electrogmagnetic calorimeter ( cem ) and central hadronic calorimeter ( cha ) are in the central region while the plug electromagnetic calorimeter ( pem ) and plug hadronic calorimeter ( pha ) are in the ` end plug ' region . in this analysis",
    ", a high-@xmath37 photon is required to be identified in the central region , where the cem has a segmentation of @xmath38 in @xmath39 and @xmath40 in @xmath41  @xcite , and an @xmath37 resolution of @xmath42  @xcite .",
    "we further require a high-@xmath37 jet to be identified in the central region , where the jet energy resolution is approximately @xmath43  @xcite .",
    "two additional systems in the central region with finer spatial resolution are used for photon identification in this analysis .",
    "the central strip system , ces , uses a multi - wire proportional chamber with 1.67- and 2.01-cm - wide cathode strips and a wire spacing of 1.45 cm to make profile measurements of electromagnetic showers at a depth of 6 radiation lengths ( approximately shower maximum ) .",
    "the central preshower detector , cpr , located just outside the solenoid coil on the front face of the cem , separates single photons from the photon pairs from @xmath44 and @xmath45 decays on a statistical basis , as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : falsephoton ] . in 2005",
    "the cpr was upgraded from the run i configuration of wire proportional chambers , similar to those used in the ces , to a fast scintillator system with a segmentation of 12.5  cm in @xmath39 and 12.5  cm in @xmath46  @xcite .",
    "the finer segmentation in @xmath46 reduces the probability of a random hit from the underlying event and multiple interactions by a factor of four , thereby improving the performance of the preshower detector in higher luminosity beam conditions .",
    "muons are identified using the central muon systems  @xcite : cmu and cmp for the pseudorapidity region of @xmath47 , and cmx for the pseudorapidity region of @xmath48 .",
    "the cmu system uses four layers of planar drift chambers to detect muons with @xmath49 gev/@xmath11 .",

    "the cmx system detects muons with @xmath49 gev/@xmath11 with four to eight layers of drift chambers , depending on the direction of the muon .",
    "the luminosity is measured using two sets of gas cerenkov counters  @xcite , located in the region @xmath51 . the total uncertainty on the luminosity is estimated to be 5.9% , where 4.4% comes from the acceptance and operation of the luminosity monitor and 4.0% from the calculation of the inelastic @xmath25 cross - section  @xcite .",
    "a three - level trigger system  @xcite selects events to be recorded for further analysis .",
    "the first two trigger levels consist of dedicated fast digital electronics analyzing a subset of the full detector data .",
    "the third level , applied to the full data of those events passing the first two levels , consists of a farm of computers that reconstruct the data and apply selection criteria consistent with the subsequent offline event processing .",
    "an initial sample of events enhanced with high energy photons is collected using a trigger that requires a high energy isolated cluster in the electromagnetic calorimeter  @xcite .",
    "we require events to have a primary vertex with @xmath52 cm .",
    "the offline selection criteria require a central ( @xmath53 ) photon with @xmath54 gev , two jets with @xmath55 and @xmath56 gev , at least one of which is identified as originating from a @xmath0 quark ( @xmath0-tagged ) , and missing transverse energy greater than 25 gev , as described in more detail below .",
    "the selection is inclusive ; i.e. we allow extra objects ( jets , photons , leptons ) in the events .",
    "the photon is required to satisfy the same identification requirements as in previous cdf high-@xmath37 photon analyses  @xcite .",
    "namely , the photon candidate is required to have no associated track with @xmath57 gev , at most one track with @xmath58 gev pointing at the calorimeter cluster  @xcite , good profiles of electromagnetic energy measured in both transverse dimensions at shower maximum , and minimal leakage into the hadron calorimeter  @xcite .",
    "photon candidates identified via these cuts are referred to as `` standard '' photons .",
    "jets are reconstructed using the jetclu cone algorithm  @xcite with cone radius @xmath59 .",
    "starting from seed locations corresponding to calorimeter towers with @xmath60 gev , all nearby towers with @xmath61 gev are used to search for stable cones . to resolve ambiguities with overlapping cones , cones sharing an energy fraction greater than @xmath62",
    "are merged into a single jet ; otherwise the shared towers are assigned to the closest jet .",
    "we apply a jet energy scale ( jes ) correction  @xcite such that the measured @xmath37 is on average equal to the summed @xmath37 of the particles from the @xmath4 interaction within the jet cone .",
    "at least one of the jets must be @xmath0-tagged using the secvtx algorithm  @xcite , which searches for displaced vertices using the reconstructed tracks inside the jet cone .",
    "missing transverse energy @xmath1 is calculated  @xcite from the calorimeter tower energies in the region @xmath63 .",
    "corrections are then applied to the @xmath1 for ( i ) the calorimeter response for identified jets  @xcite , and ( ii ) the presence of muons with @xmath64 gev .",
    "we require the corrected @xmath1 to be greater than @xmath65 gev and minimize the number of events with mismeasured @xmath1 by requiring the difference in azimuthal angle between any jet and the @xmath1 , @xmath66 , to be greater than 0.3 .",
    "the requirement @xmath67 is imposed on all combinations of the photon and the two selected jets , namely @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",

    "the trigger requires one electromagnetic ( em ) cluster with ( i ) @xmath97 25  gev , and ( ii ) isolation energy less than 2  gev or @xmath98 .",
