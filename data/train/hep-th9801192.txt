    "it is generally expected that nonrelativistic quantum theories , which provide very good descriptions of many physical phenomena , might be obtained from corresponding relativistic ones as appropriate limits for low momenta . in relativistic quantum mechanics , the reduction to nonrelativistic wave equations and hamiltonians",
    "is based on the use of canonical transformations of foldy - wouthuysen type @xcite . for a relativistic field theory , at classical level ,",
    "such a procedure can be applied to the bilinear part of the lagrangian but the treatment of interactions is not straightforward .",
    "another way to arrive at schrdinger type of lagrangian and equations of motion is to redefine the fields , by separating the factor @xmath2 , and then take the large @xmath3 ( or large - mass ) limit which eliminates rapidly oscillating terms @xcite .",
    "the nonrelativistic chern - simons ( cs ) lagrangian , which is relevant for the physics of anyons @xcite , can be obtained from the relativistic one by performing such a limit @xcite . due to quantum oscillations and renormalization problems ,",
    "however , the nonrelativistic limit of a quantum field theory is much more subtle . in this respect ,",
    "inspired in renormalization group arguments , there has been proposals of construction of effective lagrangians by amending the nonrelativistic theories with other interaction terms , representing the effect of the integration of the relativistic degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite , we have introduced a scheme of nonrelativistic approximation of a quantum field theory which uses an intermediate cutoff device and allows a systematic expansion of the scattering amplitudes in powers of @xmath0 , permitting the identification , in the hilbert space of intermediate states , of the origin of each contribution to the s - matrix perturbative series .",
    "the procedure was applied to @xmath4 theory in 2 + 1 dimensions , where there exist exact results in one loop order , so that it could be explicitly verified .",
    "this model has a well defined nonrelativistic counterpart which presents an interesting scale anomaly @xcite .    here , we extend the discussion of nonrelativistic limit to a more involving and physically appealing gauge theory by considering the chern - simons field minimally coupled to a scalar field with quartic self - interaction @xcite .",
    "the coupling of a matter field with a gauge field governed by a chern - simons action @xcite has also been studied as a limiting case of the topologically massive gauge theory @xcite in a covariant gauge @xcite , and more recently , the quantization of the fermionic model , in the coulomb gauge , has been constructed @xcite . the corresponding nonrelativistic model @xcite , including the quartic self - interaction @xcite , has been suggested as a field - theoretical formulation of the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) scattering @xcite and as an effective theory for the fractional quantum hall effect @xcite .    in the nonrelativistic theory , there exist critical values of the renormalized self - coupling parameter for which the one loop scattering vanishes and scale invariance is maintained . by choosing the positive coupling , corresponding to a repulsive contact interaction , the tree level reduces to the ab scattering @xcite .",
    "the existence of this scale invariance at the critical self - interaction has been explicitly verified up to three loops using differential regularization @xcite and was recently proven to hold in all orders of perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "this has also been obtained for the nonrelativistic limit ( in leading order ) of the 1-loop particle - particle scattering of scalar self - interacting particles minimally coupled to a cs gauge field @xcite .",
    "this criticality , however , ceases to exist in the relativistic case @xcite .    in this article",
    "we discuss the nonrelativistic approximation of the scattering amplitudes in the scalar chern - simons theory by using the above mentioned cutoff procedure . after computing next to leading nonrelativistic contributions to the two body scattering , we are able to construct a galilean effective lagrangian which extends the aharonov - bohm theory .",

    "ii , we present the relativistic model and discuss its renormalization at one loop level .",

    "iii , introduce the intermediate cutoff procedure we use to obtain the @xmath5 expansion of the quantum amplitudes .",
    "the calculation of the 1-loop particle - particle scattering amplitude up to order @xmath1 is presented in sec .",
    "iv and in the appendix .",
    "it is seen that the leading term of the @xmath0 expansion possesses the same critical self - coupling as in the nonrelativistic case . however , the subdominant parts do not vanish at the critical self - interaction values and so the aforesaid criticality is strictly nonrelativistic",
    ". the implications of this fact for the ab scattering are discussed in sec .",
    "v where we also introduce a nonrelativistic reduction scheme for the scattering amplitudes .",
    "we consider the possibility of generating the relativistic corrections by adding nonrenormalizable interactions to the nonrelativistic lagrangian and suggest an effective lagrangian that accounts for the results up to order @xmath1 .",
    "we consider a charged self - interacting scalar field in 2 + 1 dimensions minimally coupled to a chern - simons gauge field described by the lagrangian density    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the covariant derivative , @xmath8 is the fully antisymmetric tensor normalized to @xmath9 , the minkowski metric signature is ( 1 , -1 , -1 ) and the units are such that @xmath10 .",
    "as it stands , the @xmath11 is not a dynamical variable , its equation of motion represents a constraint and so there does not exist real gauge particles @xcite .",
    "however , one has to specify a gauge to work with and , by adding a gauge fixing term to the lagrangian ( [ lagran ] ) , one can treat the gauge field dynamically in the internal lines . for convenience in discussing the nonrelativistic limit ,",
    "we choose the coulomb gauge where    @xmath12    the free propagator of the gauge field is then given by    @xmath13    where @xmath14 , which reduces , in the landau limit @xmath15 , to a totally antisymmetric form in the minkowski indices with the only nonvanishing components given by    @xmath16    where @xmath17 .",
    "this gauge fixing coincides with the choice of ref.@xcite where the corresponding nonrelativistic model is discussed .",
    "notice also that , by requiring @xmath18 in ( [ gaufix ] ) to be dimensionless , we fix the mass dimension of @xmath11 as @xmath19 and so @xmath20 as having dimension of mass .",
    "the other dimensional parameters appearing in  ( [ lagran ] ) are @xmath21 and @xmath22 which dimensions are @xmath19 and @xmath23 , respectively . in 2  +  1 dimensions , the bosonic matter field has mass dimension equal to @xmath19 and its free propagator is given by @xmath24 besides the scalar field quadrilinear self - interaction vertex , minimal gauge coupling with @xmath11 generates two kinds of vertices .",

    "the particle four - point function has also divergent contributions .",
    "in fact , the 1-loop graphs containing the seagull vertex are linearly divergent .",

    "the one loop correction to the seagull vertex , presented in fig .",
    "5 , is of fourth order in the charge @xmath21 and so it does not participate in the particle - particle scattering at one loop level .",
    "no essential new contribution is expected from this correction since , by gauge invariance , it must be in accordance with the trilinear vertex one .",
    "in fact , by noticing that only the second parcel in fig .",
    "2 has the external momentum flowing through the diagram , one can readily verify the ward identities at one loop level    @xmath60    @xmath61    owing to the particular gauge we fixed , the above quantities are identically null .",

    "there remains to discuss the correction to the self - interaction vertex which represents the 2-particle scattering in one loop order .",
    "this four - point function , which will be calculated in sec .",
    "iv , is linearly divergent and therefore a counterterm of the form @xmath63 has to be introduced in the lagrangian .",
    "counterterms linear in @xmath64 , the first order taylor subtraction in the bphz scheme , are absent due to the rotational invariance , a fact that can be explicitly verified . the particle - particle scattering , for low momenta ,",
    "will be calculated using the approximation scheme we shall now describe .",
    "the nonrelativistic approximation scheme we shall employ to calculate particle - particle amplitudes in one loop order consists in the following steps @xcite . first of all , denoting by @xmath65 the loop momentum , we integrate over @xmath66 without making any restriction in order to guarantee locality in time .",
    "this integration is greatly facilitated in the gauge we are working since @xmath66 appears in the integrand of the amplitudes only via the particle propagator and the trilinear vertex factors .",
    "the advantage in using coulomb gauge to discuss the nonrelativistic limit is that it gives naturally a static interaction between the particles .    the remaining integration over the euclidean @xmath67 plane is then separated into two parcels through the introduction of an intermediate cutoff @xmath68 in the @xmath31 integration .",
    "this auxiliary cutoff @xmath69 is chosen such that it satisfies the conditions    @xmath70    where @xmath71 stands for the external nonrelativistic momenta , @xmath72 is the renormalized particle mass and @xmath73 is established as the small expansion parameter .",
    "these conditions can be easily met in nonrelativistic condensed matter systems @xcite . clearly , the cutoff @xmath68 splits the space of the intermediate states into two parts .",
    "the circle of radius @xmath68 and center at the origin of the @xmath67-plane will be referred as the low ( l ) energy sector whereas the @xmath31 @xmath74 region is the high ( h ) energy one .",
    "the approximation procedure we work with rely heavily on the intrinsic nature of each of these two sectors . in the low energy one , where all the spatial momenta involved are small ( @xmath0 @xmath75 @xmath76 )",
    ", we perform a @xmath77 expansion of the integrand .",
    "this means , for example , that the free particle energy dispersion relation can be expanded , in the l- sector , as    @xmath78    the expanded integrand is then integrated , term by term , in the region @xmath79 and , naturally , a @xmath68- dependent result is obtained .",
    "a further expansion in @xmath80 may be necessary to get the @xmath73 expansion of the l- contribution to the amplitude up to the desired order .    in the h- region , @xmath81 and the integrand",
    "can be expanded in a taylor series around @xmath82 .",
    "this permits analytical calculations of the integrals in every order in @xmath73 .",
    "certainly , this expansion does not suppress ultraviolet divergences so , in that case , a regularization procedure is assumed .",
    "the result is also @xmath68- dependent and one must expand in @xmath80 to obtain the @xmath73 expansion of the h- contribution .",
    "however , as we should expect for sake of consistence of the nonrelativistic approximation , the @xmath68- dependent parcels of the l and the h contributions of each diagram cancel identically .",
    "apparently the two sectors l and h are treated differently but , in fact , the same @xmath77 expansion is made and the exact cancellation of the @xmath68- dependent terms reflects just the additivity property of the integration . the complete amplitude obtained by adding the contributions of the l and h sectors is the correct @xmath0 expansion up to the order we have worked .",
    "it should be noticed that by choosing a distinct routing of the external momenta through the diagram ( or by using the feynman parametrization to simplify the integrand before making the @xmath66 integration ) one gets different l and h contributions for the graph .",
    "the changes , however , occur only in the coefficients of the @xmath83 which are not relevant for the reduction process we shall discuss later",
    ".    we can apply this scheme to the calculation of the one loop self - energy , vacuum polarization and vertex corrections and identify the origin of each of them . for the self - energy , the separation of the l- and h- contributions gives , up to the order @xmath84 ,    @xmath85   \\label{selow}\\ ] ]    and    @xmath86 + % \\frac{i\\lambda } { 8\\pi } m-\\frac{i\\lambda } { 8\\pi } \\lambda _ 0\\hspace{0.3cm}. \\label{sehigh}\\ ] ]    we see that the low energy intermediate states contribution is polynomial in @xmath80 and that both finite and divergent ( as @xmath87 ) parts of ( [ secutoff ] ) come from the high energy sector .",

    "the fact that the low energy intermediate states contributions to the basic radiative corrections are small and suppressed by part of the high ones reflects the nonrelativistic nature of the l sector . the corresponding nonrelativistic field theory , that is the theory with a galilean invariant , schrdinger , kinematics and the same interactions , has a distinct intrinsic nature .",
    "particle propagation is only forward in time and interactions are instantaneous .",
    "this means that there are no dynamical corrections to the mass and to the charge of the particles which are given phenomenological parameters of the theory .",
    "there is no objection , in principle , to extend the procedure described above to obtain the nonrelativistic approximation , that is the @xmath0 expansion , of quantum amplitudes in any order of perturbation theory .",
    "one naturally needs to introduce an intermediate cutoff for each independent loop integration and , certainly , makes use of the feynman parametrization to symmetrize the integrand in order to perform the @xmath66 integration .",
    "an example can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the two loop self - energy of the @xmath94 theory was calculated .",
    "to simplify calculations , we choose to work in the center of mass ( cm)frame with external particles on the mass shell , that is @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",

    "this choice is only to facilitate the comparison with the nonrelativistic case discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "we shall now calculate the 1-loop order scattering amplitude , for low external momenta and up to order @xmath84 .",
    "consider firstly the amplitude that comes from the minimally subtracted vacuum polarization and gauge vertex corrections inserted into the tree level diagrams .",
    "using equation ( [ vacpollq ] ) for the polarization tensor with @xmath100 , one immediately gets the contribution to the amplitude due to the one loop correction to the gauge field propagator as    @xmath101    similarly , the trilinear vertex correction @xmath102 , given by ( [ gama30 ] ) and ( [ gama3l ] ) , leads to the following contribution to the one loop amplitude    @xmath103    diagrams , like those shown in fig . 7 , that admixes particle self - interaction and gauge field exchange , do not contribute .",
    "the first vanishes by charge conjugation , the second is null due to the antisymmetric form of the gauge field propagator whereas the chalice diagram gives    @xmath104    this contribution , and also all the terms proportional to @xmath105 ( or @xmath106 ) appearing in the other graphs , vanishes due to due to the required symmetrization in the outgoing particles .",
    "the non admixture of the gauge coupling vertices and the self - interaction one ( at least in one loop level ) means , as we are going to see , that @xmath107 interaction comes about only to renormalize the particle - particle scattering due to cs gauge field exchange .",
    "the most important one loop particle - particle scattering comes from the diagrams shown in fig .",
    "8 and , to calculate these contributions to the 2-particle amplitude , we shall use the approximation scheme described in the last section .",
