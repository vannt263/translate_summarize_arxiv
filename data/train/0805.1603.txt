    "the d0 collaboration has recently presented new results on fermiophobic higgs searches @xcite . in @xcite",
    "they have searched for a fermiophobic higgs produced in association with a charged higgs .",
    "the full process is @xmath9 and was proposed in @xcite .",

    "was obtained in a benchmark scenario that assumes hvv ( v= w , z ) couplings to be exactly the same as in the sm and all fermion branching ratios to be exactly zero .",
    "+ all lep collaborations have searched for a fermiophobic higgs in the channel @xmath16  @xcite . the combination of all results  @xcite yielded the lower bound for the fermiophobic higgs mass of 109.7 gev , at 95% confidence level , which again is valid only in the above benchmark scenario .",
    "searches in the @xmath17 channel were also performed at lep with lower bounds derived for @xmath18 ( see references  @xcite for details ) .",
    "the new d0 bound  @xcite on @xmath15 is weaker but a larger region of the model s parameter space is covered .",
    "the channel @xmath19 had already been used at the tevatron by the cdf  @xcite and by the d0  @xcite collaborations to set limits of 78.5 gev and 82 gev at 95% confidence level , respectively , on the fermiophobic higgs mass .",
    "it is expected  @xcite that all tevatron bounds will improve once the data collected at @xmath20 luminosity is analyzed .",
    "+ there are however other ways of producing a four photon final state in a fermiophobic scenario . in this letter",
    "we will consider all fermiophobic higgs production processes with at least three photons in the final state produced via gluon fusion .",
    "as shown in @xcite , a signal with at least three photons is very easy to extract at the tevatron .",
    "the most relevant process for the analysis is @xmath21 but we can also have @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "we will show that both the tevatron and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) can probe a substantial region of the parameter space .",
    "we will discuss as well the complementarity between the different production modes .",
    "+ this paper is structured as follows : we will review the fermiophobic model in section ii and then proceed to look at the all available theoretical and experimental bounds in section iii . in section iv",
    ", we will discuss in detail the production process and in section v the signal .",
    "analysis of the results and conclusions will be presented in section vi .",
    "to define our notation we start with a brief review of the two - higgs doublet potential used here .",
    "the potential chosen is the most general , renormalizable , cp - conserving potential , invariant under @xmath24 that one can build with two complex higgs doublets .",
    "it can be written as @xmath25 &   & \\lambda_{4}(|\\phi_{1}|^2 |\\phi_{2}|^2 - |\\phi_{1}^+\\phi_{2}|^2   ) + \\lambda_{5 } [ \\re e(\\phi^+_{1}\\phi_{2 } ) -v_{1}v_{2}]^2 + \\lambda_{6 } [ \\im m(\\phi^+_{1}\\phi_{2})]^2 \\label{higgspot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 and @xmath27 have weak hypercharge y=1 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are respectively the vacuum expectation values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 and the @xmath30 are real  valued parameters .",
    "note that this potential violates the discrete symmetry @xmath31 only softly by the dimension two term @xmath32 .",
    "the hard breaking terms ( dimension four ) of the discrete symmetry have been set to zero .",
    "as in all other thdm , we end up with two cp - even higgs states usually denoted by @xmath33 and @xmath34 , one cp - odd state , @xmath35 and two charged higgs bosons , @xmath36 .",
    "the potential in eq .",
    "( [ higgspot ] ) has 8 parameters ( including @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) .",
    "the combination @xmath37 is fixed as usual by the electroweak breaking scale through @xmath38 .",
    "we are thus left with 7 independent parameters ; namely @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "equivalently , we can take instead @xmath41 as the 7 independent parameters .",
    "the angle @xmath42 is the rotation angle from the group eigenstates to mass eigenstates in the cp - odd and charged sector .",
    "the angle @xmath43 is the corresponding rotation angle for the cp - even sector .",
    "+ in a general thdm it is possible to couple just one doublet to all fermions by choosing an appropriate symmetry for both the fermions and the scalars .",
    "this model is known as thdm type i in the literature .",
    "like in the sm , where just one doublet couples to all fermions , each scalar couples to the different fermions with the same coupling constant . however , unlike the sm , the couplings are now proportional to the rotation angles @xmath43 and @xmath42 .",
    "for instance , the lightest cp - even higgs couples to the fermions as @xmath44 . by choosing @xmath45 , the lightest cp - even higgs decouples from all fermions .",
    "it is usually referred to as a fermiophobic higgs scalar  @xcite . this way the heavy cp - even scalar will acquire larger couplings to the fermions than the corresponding sm couplings .",
    "the remaining scalars are not affected by this choice as they do not couple proportionally to @xmath43 .",
    "however , @xmath33 can still decay to two fermion pairs via or",
    ". we will include these decays in our analysis .",
    "it is worth pointing out that these processes occur near the @xmath46 threshold .",
    "decays of @xmath33 to two fermions can also be induced by scalar and gauge boson loops ( see e.g. fig .  [",
    "fig : fig_hff ] ) . in the thdm ,",
    "the angle @xmath43 has to be renormalized to render @xmath47 finite .",
    "however , at @xmath48 , all one - loop decays @xmath49 are finite .",
    "thus we can impose the following condition for the renormalization constant @xmath50 : the renormalized one - loop decay width for @xmath47 is equal to the finite unrenormalized decay width .",
    "this condition is equivalent to setting @xmath51_{\\alpha=\\pi/2}=0 $ ] . in @xcite",
    "we have checked that this condition holds for all fermions .",
    "the only relevant one - loop decay is @xmath52 due to a large contribution of the feynman diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_hff ] to the total decay width  $ ] is proportional to the @xmath53-quark mass . ] .",
    "thus , on one hand , @xmath33 is not completely fermiophobic at @xmath48 , and on the other hand , all decays @xmath47 but @xmath54 are almost zero even at one - loop level .",
    "nevertheless it is possible , although hard , to find regions of the parameter space where @xmath55 has a sizeable effect in the fermiophobic higgs signature . with this in mind",
    "it is obvious that we are working with a version of the model with one less parameter than the general cp - conserving thdm .",
    "[ sec : bounds ] in our analysis we take into account the following experimental and theoretical constraints .",
    "note however that we will use the theoretical constraints as guides and explain in each case how they would affect the results given in the plots .",
    "we believe that if nature did not provide a fermiophobic higgs it should be disallowed ultimately by experiment .    * experimental bounds from lep ;",
    "the lep collaborations have set bounds on the mass of a fermiophobic higgs as a function of @xmath56 .",
    "the most stringent bound comes from the combination of all lep experiments given in  @xcite .",
    "the 95% cl limit on @xmath56 is about 18 for @xmath57 gev . from @xmath57 gev until @xmath58 gev , the bound oscillates about @xmath59 . for @xmath60 gev",
    ", @xmath61 is already a conservative bound . in the plots @xmath62",
    "is used because much higher values of @xmath56 would violate perturbativity constraints .",
    "note however that as we will show , @xmath63 is independent of @xmath56 and for @xmath64 the dependence of all other relevant processes is negligible . + there is another bound on the fermiophobic higgs coming from @xmath65 production at lep which constrains severely the value of @xmath66 especially for small @xmath33 masses .",
    "if however we take the @xmath35 mass to be above 150 gev , the @xmath65 production is no longer a constraint for all values of @xmath56 .",
    "+ finally , if @xmath56 is large , the @xmath67 coupling is suppressed while the non - fermiophobic cp - even higgs @xmath34 will couple to the @xmath68 bosons with almost the sm strength .",
    "therefore , in the plots shown , the minimum value of the @xmath34 mass is 100 gev and most cases presented are for an @xmath34 mass above 120 gev . + * as already stated in the introduction , the d0 and cdf experiments recently reported searches for a fermiophobic higgs in two different channels . d0 searched  @xcite for the inclusive production of di - photon final states via the higgsstrahlung and vector boson fusion .",
    "the bound with the model benchmark described in the introduction is weaker than the lep bound but it spans a larger region of the parameter space .",
    "the search  @xcite in the @xmath69 channel sets a bound on the fermiophobic higgs mass for each pair of values of @xmath10",
    ". we will take all these bounds into consideration in our analysis .",
    "* the extra contributions to the @xmath70 parameter from the higgs scalars @xcite should not exceed the current limits from precision measurements @xcite : @xmath71 .",
    "such an extra contribution to @xmath70 vanishes in the limit @xmath72 . to ensure that @xmath70 will be within the allowed range whenever possible we allow only a small splitting between @xmath73 and @xmath74 . *",
    "recently , it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that for thdm models of the type ii , data on @xmath75 imposes a lower limit of @xmath76gev . in thdm type i",
    ", there is no such constraint on the charged higgs mass .",
    "therefore , in our numerical analysis which is valid for thdm type i we will ignore the limit on the charged higgs . * the scalar sector",
    "can also be constrained using perturbativity constraints on @xmath30 @xcite . in the present study",
    "we will not impose those constraints in order to quantify the optimal cross sections and scan over all parameters space .",
    "in fact , in the fermiophobic limit , the process @xmath77 for example depends only on @xmath15 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "as we will explain later , the @xmath80 dependence in @xmath81 drops out . as a result , for a given @xmath15 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , one can tune @xmath80 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 in order to satisfy perturbativity constraints . * from the requirement of perturbativity for the top and bottom yukawa couplings @xcite , @xmath80 is constrained to lie in the range @xmath84 .",
    "but it turns out that from perturbativity argument on @xmath30 , moderate values of @xmath80 less than about 10 are preferred .    in order to respect perturbativity constraints we will use moderate values for @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88",
    "the process @xmath89 has both tree level contributions mediated by higgs exchange from @xmath90 and one loop contributions from gluon fusion @xmath91 .",
    "the tree level contribution is proportional to the quark masses which will be neglected for the tevatron energies .",
    "we have also checked that even in the large @xmath56 limit the production process @xmath92 is also negligible for the lhc when compared to @xmath93 .",
    "the process @xmath94 occurs only at the one - loop level .",
    "as we will see , even if loop suppressed , this process can still be enhanced by the strong qcd coupling as well as by the heavy higgs @xmath34 resonant effect when it can decay to two light cp even @xmath33 scalars .",
    "there are two types of diagrams that participate in the process @xmath94 .    the box diagram , as shown in fig  [ fig : fig_boxhhgg ] represents just a generic contribution to the process .",
    "we have also included all other quarks and because both the initial and the final state have identical particles , there is a total of six diagrams for each flavor .",
    "the second type are the vertex diagrams which again are six for each flavor . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_verthhgg ] we show just the representative diagrams with a generic fermion in the loop . in the fermiophobic limit ,",
    "the top loop is always the dominant contribution .",
    "the other two processes , @xmath95 and @xmath96 have a similar structure ( vertex and box ) to @xmath97 , except for one additional contribution to the vertex diagrams in @xmath98 which is the @xmath68 boson and the goldstone boson s - channel exchange .",
    "+ however , in the fermiophobic limit , all box contributions vanish and the same is true for all vertex contribution with s - channel higgs ( @xmath33 ) exchange due to the fact that the fermiophobic higgs coupling to fermions is zero . since the box contributions drop out in the fermiophobic limit , the two processes @xmath99 are directly proportional to the pure scalar couplings @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "the third process @xmath102 is sensitive both to pure scalar couplings @xmath103 and @xmath104 as well as to the gauge coupling @xmath105 .",
    "hereafter we list the pure scalar coupling in the fermiophobic limit ( fl ) needed for our study : @xmath106 \\label{aal}\\\\ \\lambda_{a g h}^{fl } & = & \\frac{e \\ ,   \\sin \\beta}{2 m_w s_w}\\bigg ( m^2_{a } - m^2_{h}\\bigg)\\label{agl}\\\\ \\lambda_{hh^\\pm h^\\mp}^{fl}&= & \\frac{e}{2 m_w s_w\\sin 2\\beta}\\bigg[2 \\sin^3\\beta m^2_{h } -   \\lambda_5 v^2 \\sin\\beta- 2 \\sin{2\\beta } \\cos{\\beta } m^2_{h^\\pm } \\bigg]\\label{lhphm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the @xmath107 and @xmath101 couplings are directly proportional to @xmath79 while the @xmath103 coupling depend both on @xmath79 , @xmath74 as well as on @xmath108 .",
    "it is clear that in the case of exact discrete @xmath109 symmetry ( @xmath110 ) , both @xmath100 and @xmath101 would vanish . in the fermiophobic limit , all fermions couple to each scalar with the same strength .",
    "the @xmath111 coupling is proportional to @xmath112 .",
    "therefore from eq .",
    "[ hll ] we conclude that the @xmath42 angle dependence cancels out in the cross section , _ that is _ , @xmath113 depends only on @xmath15 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the @xmath114 coupling is proportional to @xmath115 which means that in the large @xmath56 limit the @xmath42 angle dependence is also very mild except for very large @xmath33 and/or @xmath35 masses . those cases",
    "will not be included in our study . finally , note that not only @xmath113 vanishes in the limit @xmath110 but also @xmath116 , in the high @xmath56 limit becomes negligible when @xmath117 due to to the smallness of the values of the masses involved .",
    "+ the one - loop amplitudes were generated and calculated with the packages feynarts @xcite and formcalc @xcite .",
    "the scalar integrals were evaluated with looptools @xcite .      in this section",
    ", we present our numerical results . as stated earlier , to avoid the lep bounds on the fermiophobic higgs we will fix @xmath80 to be of the order 10 for the processes @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "this way we suppress the @xmath67 coupling while keeping perturbativity bounds on @xmath30 within the allowed range .",
    "+ the first consequence of this choice of @xmath120 is that the coupling @xmath121 is enhanced ( @xmath122 ) while @xmath123 is suppressed ( see eqs .",

    "we probe the region of small @xmath34 and/or @xmath35 masses while @xcite probes the small charged higgs mass region .",
    "the advantage in our case is that our study is independent of @xmath56 while their process does not depend on @xmath79 .",
    "finally if all higgs scalars besides the fermiophobic higgs are very heavy , only the two photon search can exclude a fermiophobic higgs . +",
    "as expected and as it was shown in  @xcite the background for a 3 or 4 photon final state is easy to control . in the case of the 3 photon final state",
    "the main background contribution comes from the direct tri - photon production ( see  @xcite for details ) .",
