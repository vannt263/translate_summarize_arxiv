    "recent observations of elemental abundances in extremely metal - poor halo stars ( mcwilliam 1995 , ryan 1996 ) uncovered evidence which suggests that the chemical evolution of the early galactic halo was quite inhomogeneous .",
    "for example , the abundances of various elements exhibit a large scatter , even for stars having the same metallicity ( as quantified by [ fe / h ] ) , in contradiction to the predictions of simple one - zone models which , under the assumption that gas of the interstellar medium ( ism ) is well - mixed , suggest that overall stellar metallicity should be strongly correlated with age .",
    "the amount of ejected heavy elements from supernovae ( sne ) shows a strong dependence on the mass of sn progenitors , and furthermore , this dependence is different for different elements ( woosley & weaver 1995 ; tsujimoto & shigeyama 1998 ) .",
    "audouze & silk ( 1995 ) have further argued that the observed abundance patterns for metal - poor stars reflect the elemental abundance ratios of ejected elements by sne with a discrete range of progenitor masses . as a result of the limited mixing of the ism in the early stages of the galactic halo , the chemical compositions of these stars are apparently providing information on sn events that occurred in their local environment , during the first epochs of star formation .    the situation described above",
    "can be understood by a simple order of magnitude argument as follows .",
    "we define a volume of galactic disk as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the radius of the disk and @xmath3 is the half thickness .",
    "then it follows that @xmath4 , when adopting @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",
    "the sn - rate in the current disk is about one sn per 30 yrs , and a typical sn remnant ( snr ) shell can expand to @xmath7 100 pc before diffusing away in about 3 myr ( tsujimoto , shigeyama , & yoshii 1999 ; hereafter tsy ) if its expansion is not stopped by merging with other snr shells .",
    "then , the swept - up volume of ism by all the coeval snr shells is about @xmath8400 kpc@xmath9 , exceeding @xmath10 200 kpc@xmath9 , which implies that the snr shells easily merge with one another . on the other hand , because the halo extends to 50 kpc , its total volume , @xmath11 , is expected to be larger than that of current disk by three to four orders of magnitude .",
    "provided that the total sn - rate in the galaxy at early epochs was less than @xmath7 50 times of that of today , which is acceptable according to the analysis of star formation history by madau ( 1998 ) , it follows that @xmath12 at early epochs .",
    "this indicates that each snr in the halo could survive without merging with other snr shells .",
    "the heavy elements synthesized and ejected from a sn are confined in its snr shell , and do not mix easily with those originating from other sne , or already existing in the interstellar medium .",
    "tsy presented a sn - induced chemical evolution model based on the assumption of incomplete mixing of the heavy elements in the halo . in their model",
    "_ all _ of the stars at early epochs were born in snr shells , under the assumption that these shells , due to their relatively high densities , are suitable sites for star formation .",
    "their model explains the observed large scatter of heavy element abundances in metal - poor halo stars very well , especially the trend of europium abundances .",
    "an important prediction of this model is that the metallicity of metal - poor stars has no one - to - one correspondence with age .",
    "suzuki , yoshii , & kajino ( 1999 ; hereafter syk ) extended this model to include an analysis of light elements , such as @xmath0li , @xmath13be , and b ( @xmath14b+@xmath15b ) , which are mainly produced by reactions involving galactic cosmic rays ( gcrs ) , and demonstrated that this model also reproduces the observed trends of @xmath13be and b data .",
    "syk proposed a new scenario that gcrs originate directly from acceleration of the sn ejecta , and also from acceleration of particles in the ism swept up by snr .",
    "syk pointed out that the one might expect that the abundance of light elements , @xmath0libeb , in metal - poor stars should exhibit a much better correlation to their age , in sharp contrast to the situation for their heavy element abundances .",
    "there are ( at least ) two significant issues concerning the production of light elements in the early galaxy which must be confronted .",
    "the first is that the observed linear trend of be and b with metallicity contradicts with that derived from the usual spallation processes of energetic protons or @xmath16-particles impinging on cno elements in the ism .",
    "the production rate of the light elements appears _ constant _ with respect to metallicity , when we take the observations at face value , while the usual spallation processes predict that the production rate should be _ proportional _ to metallicity , so that a quadratic trend of be and b with metallicity is expected .",
    "as one possible solution , duncan ( 1992 ) and yoshii , kajino , & ryan ( 1997 ) proposed an `` inverse '' spallation process applied in the early galaxy , with energetic cno nuclei originating from freshly synthesized sn - ejecta impinging on protons and @xmath16-particles in ism producing be and b. the production rate predicted from these inverse processes is almost constant as a function of metallicity , because sne of metal - poor progenitors synthesize a comparable amount of cno elements to metal - rich sne .",
    "the condition for these processes to work is that synthesized cno elements in sne should be efficiently injected into the acceleration region around the snr shock .",
    "however , based on a reanalysis of elemental abundances of present - day gcrs and an examination of acceleration process thought to be provided by the snr shock , meyer & ellison ( 1999 ) and ellison & meyer ( 1999 ) have recently argued that most gcrs were accelerated out of the ism or circumstellar material instead of sn ejecta , although they suggested that , owing to the lack of cno in the ism at early epochs , energetic cno out of fresh sn ejecta might still play a role in light element production . as a compromise solution ,",
    "syk claimed that if @xmath17% of gcrs originate from sn - ejecta , in agreement with the estimate by meyer & ellison ( 1999 ) and ellison & meyer ( 1999 ) , the linear trend of beb with metallicity can be achieved for stars with [ fe / h]@xmath18 .",
    "fields & olive ( 1999 ) argued that oxygen , instead of iron , should represent the `` metallicity , '' because beb elements are mainly produced by spallation of oxygen in the early stages of the galaxy .",
    "they claimed that a quadratic beb trend with o results , when using the increasing trend of [ o / fe ] inferred from the observations of israelian ( 1998 ) and boesgaard ( 1999 ) for the stars of extremely low metallicity .",
    "however , this trend of oxygen relative to iron is still controversial , and also differs from the trend of other @xmath16-elements such as mg ( fields 1999 also mentioned this problem ) .",
    "the second issue concerns the shortage of available energy to accelerate gcrs in order to produce the observed level of abundances of light elements .",
    "ramaty ( 1997 ) pointed out the importance of the `` energy budget '' of gcrs when investigating the evolution of light elements , and they concluded that gcrs should be more metal - rich than the ambient matter to account for the observed be abundance in metal - poor stars .",
    "the energetics of the production of light elements in snrs has been intensively studied by parizot & drury ( 1999a , b ; hereafter pda , b ) .",
    "they also concluded that energy input by individual sne is about one order of magnitude lower than that required to reproduce the observations . to solve this discrepancy ,",
    "the a superbubble model was suggested by higdon ( 1998 ) as the source of metal - rich energetic particles ( eps ) .",
    "since the material in superbubbles becomes metal rich due to collective explosions of sne , enough cno nuclei can be accelerated by successive sne , with no need for the artificial selective acceleration of cno nuclei . from extensive calculations , parizot & drury ( 1999c ; hereafter pdc )",
    "concluded that superbubbles are capable of producing enough of the light elements to satisfy the observed level .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the superbubble model can not simultaneously explain the large scatter of heavy elements in metal - poor stars ( see more discussion of this point in  [ sec : sbmd ] ) . in this sense the second problem still persists .    in this paper",
    "we formulate the model of sn - induced chemical evolution in  [ mdlgce ] , and the model of eps in  [ sec : gcr ] and  [ sec : leps ] .",
    "we argue that an acceptable relation among three unknown parameters ( input energy to eps per sn , the spectral shape of eps , and composition of eps ) can be found that reproduces the observed abundance of light elements (  [ sec : ccpr ] ) .",
    "the results of our model are presented in  [ sec : rslt ] .",
    "we compare the predicted evolution of light elements with recent observations in  [ sec : cmpobs ] , and we predict the evolution of the composition of gcrs in the early stage of the galactic halo in  [ sec : cmpcr ] . in  [ sec : tmr ] we discuss the feasibility of using the abundances of each of the light elements as age indicators for old metal - poor stars .",
    "other related topics are discussed in ",
    "[ sec : dscs ] .",
    "our model is compared with an alternative model of superbubbles as a source of light elements in  [ sec : sbmd ] in terms of energetics of gcrs , and the possibility of considering agns as another accelerator of eps is discussed in  [ sec : agn ] .",
    "in this section we present formulae which describe the chemical evolution in an inhomogeneous early galaxy , circumstances that are expected to arise from the stochastic nature of star - forming processes induced by sn explosions .",
    "star - forming processes are assumed to be confined in separate clouds of mass @xmath19 which make up the entire halo at early epochs .",
    "we set @xmath20 throughout all the calculations in this paper , because the results of the calculation do not depend crucially on the value of this parameter .",
    "the evolution of a cloud starts at time @xmath21 when a certain fraction , @xmath22 , of the cloud turns into metal - free pop iii stars with an initial mass function , @xmath23 , having a salpeter index of @xmath24 with upper and lower mass limits of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively . in our calculations , @xmath27 is set to be @xmath28 , which satisfies the condition that more than one pop iii star explodes as a type ii sne ( sne ii ) to trigger successive star - forming processes ( tsy ) .",
    "chemical evolution characterized by star formation processes is triggered by sn explosions .",
    "since the velocity of ejected matter in sn explosions exceeds the sound velocity there , a shock front is formed and swept - up ism material will be accumulated behind the front to form a dense shell .",
    "although the temperature of the shell is quite high at first , the shell gradually cools as it loses energy ( mainly by radiative losses ) , and it will eventually form cool and dense fragments . some of these fragments might become seeds of new stars .",
    "all stars of subsequent generations are assumed to form in these shells behind the radiative shock front .",
    "the mass fraction , @xmath29 , of each shell that turns into stars , is taken as a constant . here",
    ", we adopt @xmath30 , which gives the best fit to the observed [ fe / h ] distribution function for various values of @xmath31 ( tsy ) . then , the star formation rate ( sfr ) at time @xmath32 is given by    @xmath33    where @xmath34 denotes the lifetime of a star with mass @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the stellar mass for which @xmath37 .",
    "a lower mass limit for stars that explode as sne is taken to be @xmath38 .",
    "the mass of the shell is given by    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the mass of the sn ejecta , and @xmath41 is the mass of the gas swept up by the snr , given by @xmath42 as a function of explosion energy , @xmath43 , per sn ( shigeyama & tsujimoto 1998 ; tsy ) .",
    "using the sfr in eq.([eqn : sfr ] ) , the mass of gas , @xmath44 , changes with time according to the star formation and the gas ejection from stellar mass loss and sn explosions ( tsy ) :",
    "@xmath45    the abundance of the @xmath46-th heavy element in the gas , @xmath47 , changes with time according to the formula ( tsy ) :    @xmath48    @xmath49    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the mass of synthesized @xmath46-th heavy element ejected from a star with mass @xmath35 , and @xmath52 is the stellar abundance of the @xmath46-th element born at time @xmath32 from a snr shell with progenitor mass @xmath35 .",
    "the second term denotes the @xmath46-th ejected element that has survived through stellar evolution after being trapped in stars , and the third term is the ejected element which is newly synthesized through the stellar evolution and sn explosion . since stars are formed in the snr shell that contains _ both _ sn ejecta and swept - up ism , the stellar metallicity can be written as ( tsy ) :    @xmath53    as light elements are easily burned by the stellar nuclear processes at temperatures of a few @xmath54k , we can assume that these elements , once taken up by stars , are quickly destroyed .",
    "some of light elements are produced by gcrs _ globally _ propagating in the cloud , and others by the eps confined in each snr that will be thermalized without escaping from the snr .",
    "the local eps will produce the light elements in the same snr by collisional reactions and the amount of the produced light element @xmath55 in each snr , @xmath56 , depends on the amount of cno ejected from each sn having a variety of progenitor mass @xmath35 .",
    "these locally produced light elements will be modeled later in  [ sec : leps ] .",
    "then , the abundance of the @xmath55-th element in the gas , @xmath57 , changes as follows :    @xmath58    @xmath59    @xmath60    @xmath61    with @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the mass number of the @xmath64-th element and @xmath65 is the abundance of hydrogen or helium .",

    "@xmath67 gives the retention fraction of @xmath55-th product that can survive to be thermalized in the ism , and @xmath68 is the time - dependent flux of gcr projectile @xmath64 , which is modeled in  [ sec : gcr ] .",
    "the second term in eq.([eqn : chevle ] ) represents the production by global gcrs , and the third term production by eps confined in each snr .",
    "@xmath69 in the last term represents the mass of the ejected @xmath55-th element synthesized by the neutrino process just after sn explosions ( woosley 1990 ) , which is only significant for the production of @xmath70li and @xmath15b ( vangioni - flam 1996 ) .",
    "the yield tables of woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) are used for the @xmath71-process , but the absolute values are decreased by a factor of 5 in order to reproduce the observed @xmath14b/@xmath15b ratio ( vangioni - flam 1996 , 1998 ) in our calculation .",
    "the stellar abundance of the @xmath55-th element is equal to that in the snr shell and is given by    @xmath72    @xmath73 /m_{\\rm sh}(m , t)\\ ; , \\ ] ]    where @xmath74 is a typical diffusion time of a snr shell ( tsy ) .",
    "the first term in the numerator represents the mass of the @xmath55-th element produced during @xmath75 by _ global _ gcrs originating from all the sne that explode at time @xmath32 .",
    "the second and third terms are the masses of the @xmath55-th element produced by _",
    "local _ eps and that by the neutrino process , respectively , and the last term represents the mass of the @xmath55-th element included in the swept - up material .",
    "in our scenario all the eps originate from sn explosions .",
    "those particles absorb the energy of the explosions by being scattered back and forth across the shock front ( first - order fermi acceleration ) .",
    "some of them are scattered far away , upstream of the blast wave s ( forward ) shock , and will propagate as gcrs , while some of the eps are trapped inside the snr and will produce the light elements there by inelastic collisional reactions ( pda , b ) .",
    "these two types of eps give different results , from the viewpoint of the spatial inhomogeneity of the abundance of light elements .",
    "it is expected that _",
    "global _ gcrs will produce these elements uniformly in the entire cloud at the same epoch by the spallation of cno elements in the ism , while _ local _ eps confined in each snr will produce these elements in a way that their abundance depends on the amount of cno elements ejected from different progenitor masses of sne .",
    "in the next two subsections the models of these two types of eps are presented .",
    "some of the energetic particles ( accelerated as described above ) can escape from the snr , and will propagate far outside the snr shell .",
    "these eps , or gcrs , are expected to be distributed much more uniformly over the patchy structure of the early ism .",
    "although most of these particles are expected to originate from acceleration of the swept - up ism by the forward shock , some of them come from sn - ejecta injected in the acceleration region behind the forward shock by various mechanisms , which are considered in detail below .",
    "sn ejecta , if condensed into grains , can be injected more effectively into the acceleration region because the mass - to - charge ratio for grains is higher , and it follows that the the larmor radius is larger ( lingenfelter 1998 ) .    mass loss from progenitor stars",
    "before the sn - explosions take place makes it possible for the forward shock to easily accelerate the previously - ejected metal - rich material surrounding the central stars .",
    "progenitor stars of sneii lose their mass over their entire lifetimes , mainly by radiation - driven stellar winds ( e.g. chiosi & maeder 1986 ) .",
    "therefore , at the time of the sn - explosion , a circumstellar envelope composed of ejected material during the pre - sn - explosion era is thought to exist around the central star .",
    "such circumstellar envelopes have been observed in several snrs ( plait 1995 for sn1987a ; benetti 1998 for sn1994aj ; chu 1999 for sn1978k ) .",
    "in particular , the mass ejected by the explosion of sn1994aj is estimated to be 3 - 5@xmath76 , while the mass of progenitor star in the main sequence phase is thought to have been 820@xmath76 , which indicates that about half or more of the initial mass of the progenitor star has been lost during the pre - sn - explosion era .",
    "observations of the abundance ratios of cno elements in the ring around sn1987a show that it consists of the material synthesized in the stellar interior ( panagia 1996 ) .",
    "this fact implies that even the products synthesized in the deep stellar interior can be dredged up to the stellar surface by convection ( e.g. maeder 1987 ; heger 2000 ) , and ejected by stellar winds to form the circumstellar envelope before the sn explosion .",
    "although the above considerations are based on observations of present - day snr , even very metal - poor old stars are expected to contain significant amounts of heavy elements in their outer envelopes during later evolutionary stages , from this `` self - pollution '' process .",
    "these dredged - up heavy elements would play a crucial role to drive stellar winds as major opacity sources . as a result ,",
    "more metal - rich circumstellar envelopes than the ambient ism are expected to be formed , and the forward shock created after the sn - explosions can accelerate such metal - rich materials originating from stellar nucleosynthesis , as well as the metal - poor ism , with similar efficiency .",
    "owing to the processes described above , these eps accelerated by the forward shock are supposed to be a mixture of metal - rich stellar and sn ejecta ( we hereafter call `` sn ejecta '' for simplicity ) and metal - poor ism . syk proposed a new model that takes into account these two origins of gcrs using a free parameter , @xmath77 , as defined below .",
    "we employ the same parameterization .",
    "when the momentum spectrum , which is expected from shock acceleration theory ( blandford , & ostriker 1978 ; blandford , & ostriker 1980 ) , is used , the source spectrum of global gcrs in units of @xmath78 at time @xmath32 can be written as    @xmath79^{\\frac{\\gamma+1}{2}}}\\int_{\\max ( { m_t{\\rm , } \\",

    "it should be noted that @xmath77 _ determines _ the elemental composition of gcrs .",
    "the total flux of the source is normalized by the input energy of sne .",
    "if we define @xmath85 as the energy used to accelerate particles into gcrs per sn , and @xmath86 as the sn - rate at time @xmath32 in a given cloud ( which can be calculated from the formula presented in  [ mdlgce ] ) , then @xmath87 is related to @xmath85 and @xmath88 as follows :    @xmath89    where @xmath90 is the highest energy achieved by sn explosions and @xmath91 is the low - energy cutoff .",
    "provided @xmath92 , particles with energy @xmath93 make little contribution to the total integrated energy carried by the bulk of gcrs , so we here adopt @xmath94 .",

    "star - forming processes are confined to occur in separate clouds with mass @xmath127 , making up an entire galactic halo ( @xmath128 ) .",
    "thus , the early halo consists of @xmath129 such clouds .",
    "some clouds start their evolution with sn explosions of first - generation stars ( metal - free pop iii stars ) earlier than others , so that clouds have their own evolutionary histories arising from different sfrs .",
    "some of the gcrs originating from a given sn in a cloud can leak out of it and reach different clouds . while we incorporate the contribution of these gcrs coming from other clouds just by increasing the escape length , @xmath102",
    ", we do not perform a more precise modeling of different histories of sfr or sn - rates in different clouds . however , the dominant component of gcrs in each cloud is obviously composed of gcrs originating from sne that exploded in the same cloud , because the flux of gcrs coming from other clouds is decreased considerably , being inversely proportional to the square of distance ( under the assumption of isotropic propagation ) .",
    "moreover , the average history of star formation in the galactic halo is constrained to reproduce the observed [ fe / h ] distribution of metal - poor stars (  [ mdlgce ] ) , so that typical clouds are expected to have , more or less , a similar star formation history to that considered in our model .",
    "thus , our model , which assumes that the flux of gcrs is in proportion to the sn - rate in the cloud , can account for the expected evolution of typical clouds in the galactic halo .",
    "it is commonly assumed that at least some eps are trapped in snr shells by the diffusion barriers around the shock front , even after getting enough energy to produce the light elements ( e.g. , vii  4 in berezinsli@xmath122 1990 ) . for the purpose of establishing a more sophisticated model to investigate global evolutionary trends of the light elements ,",
    "it is indispensable to take into account the production of light elements by these eps trapped inside each snr , in addition to the production by gcrs propagating globally outside the snrs .",
    "eps in the snr , and their production of light elements during the sedov - taylor phase , have been intensively studied by pdab . based on their model",
    ", we consider the region inside the snr as a viable production site for light elements",
    ". some of the trapped eps will produce light elements in the snr , lose their energy , and never escape . in our model",
    ", we define @xmath130 ( the subscript indicates `` local cosmic rays '' ) as the amount of energy per sn absorbed by the particles which receive enough energy to produce the light elements , but subsequently lose that energy and become thermalized in the same snr .",

    "( [ eqn : chevle ] ) & ( [ eqn : shable ] ) ) of the light elements contributed from nuclear processes involving these confined eps , as correlated with the mass @xmath35 of the progenitor to the sn .",
    "since the typical evolution timescale ( @xmath132 yrs ) of the snr is much shorter than the typical timescale ( @xmath133 yrs ) for the chemical evolution of the clouds in the galactic halo , one has to adopt a much shorter timescale when considering production of light elements in the evolving snr , which is usually approximated as an instantaneous event in the context of the chemical evolution of the clouds .",
    "we define @xmath134 as the time elapsed after _ each _ sn event , which should be distinguished from the time @xmath32 elapsed after the formation of first stars in the cloud , so that @xmath134 is used as an independent variable to describe the phenomena occurring in the evolving snr .",
    "according to standard snr theory , the forward shock survives until the snr shell loses its identity , while the reverse shock exists only at very the beginning of the sedov - taylor phase ( truelove & mckee 1999 ) .",
    "therefore , since no energy is input to eps after the reverse shock disappears , the particles accelerated by the reverse shock more easily lose their energy and are trapped in the snr , as compared with those accelerated by the forward shock . for simplicity , we assume that these particles which are finally thermalized in the snr are those accelerated by the reverse shock , and the acceleration occurs only at the very beginning of the sedov - taylor phase .",
    "we here define @xmath135 as the time when the sedov - taylor phase starts , corresponding to the time when the swept - up mass is equal to the ejected mass , @xmath40 .",

    "following pdab , the adiabatic loss rate is given by    @xmath156    we would like to address how much the change of @xmath143 changes the production of the light elements . when the ionization and nuclear destruction dominate",
    "the loss , different @xmath143 s would give the same total production , because the production rate is linearly proportional to @xmath143 in the same way as the loss timescale , so that the @xmath143-dependencies are cancelled out in multiplying the production rate and the loss time to give the total production .",
    "on the other hand , the adiabatic loss time only weakly depends on @xmath143 , so higher @xmath143 gives rise to more target nuclei to produce light elements .",
    "the @xmath143-dependence of the production of light elements has been considered also by pdab , and our model confirms their basic result .",
    "as far as light - element production is concerned , the effect of changing @xmath143 is similar to `` tuning '' a value of @xmath157 .",

    "then , the total mass of the @xmath55-th element , @xmath162 , produced by a sn of progenitor mass @xmath35 can be calculated by integrating the production rate of light elements over @xmath134 through the snr phase :    @xmath163    @xmath164{m_{\\rm snr}(m , t')}{\\rm , } \\ ] ]    with @xmath165 where @xmath166 is the time at which eps are no longer capable of producing light elements ( due to energy loss ) , @xmath167 is the abundance of either hydrogen or helium in the snr of progenitor mass @xmath35 at time @xmath134 , and @xmath168 is the @xmath46-th element abundance , given by    @xmath169      the model presented in the previous sections has three free parameters that character the global gcrs  the spectral index , @xmath170 , of eps at the source , the parameter @xmath77 , which quantifies the proportion of gcrs originating from sn ejecta and the swept - up ism , and the energy , @xmath85 per sn , that accelerates the gcrs . in order to take into account local processes involving eps in the snr shell , we need another parameter , @xmath130 per sn , absorbed by the eps which are thermalized in the snr shell . in the real situation , @xmath170 has different values for different processes , and is time - dependent as the physical state of the shock changes .",
    "however , here we employ a single value of @xmath170 as an average over different processes and phases .    in this subsection we constrain the values of these free parameters based on @xmath116li observations reported by smith ( 1998 ) , cayrel ( 1999 ) , and nissen ( 2000 ) and @xmath171be by boesgaard et al .",
    "@xmath116li is produced by @xmath172 fusion and the spallation of cno elements , whereas @xmath171be is produced exclusively by the spallation of cno .",
    "both @xmath116li and @xmath171be abundances have been measured in two metal - poor stars , hd 84937 and bd + 26@xmath173 3578 , yielding a @xmath116li to @xmath171be ratio of 50@xmath7100 , though the ratio of spallation cross sections to produce @xmath116li and @xmath171be is as small as 5 .",
    "this implies that @xmath116li is mainly produced by @xmath172 fusion in the early galaxy . since the helium in the universe",
    "was mostly produced by big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , and distributed globally in the halo , the abundance of @xmath16-particles is expected to be almost constant in either the ism or gcrs .",
    "so the production rate of @xmath116li depends little on the composition of heavier nuclei in gcrs , but rather , is determined by the flux of eps in the relevant energy range , that is , the spectral shape , @xmath170 , and energy , @xmath85 , necessary to accelerate gcrs .",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "1 shows the transported flux ( solid lines ) and the source flux ( dashed lines ) of gcrs for two cases , @xmath174 , and @xmath175 . the total input energy to eps at the source",
    "is taken to be the same for both @xmath170 s , so that the flux of eps in the low energy region of @xmath7100mev / a for the softer spectrum case ( @xmath176 ) is one order of magnitude higher than for the other case .",
    "the cross section for producing @xmath116li by @xmath16 + @xmath16 fusion strongly depends on the energy of incident eps , and has a maximum value in the low - energy region of 10 - 100mev / a ( the bottom panel of fig .",
    "1 ) . therefore",
    ", the production rate of @xmath116li is very sensitive to the spectral shape of eps  the softer spectrum obviously results in more @xmath0li production ( see also vangioni - flam 1999 ) .",
    "thus , we are able to constrain the relation between @xmath170 and @xmath85 from the observed @xmath116li to fe ratio . at present",
    "there are only three reported detections of @xmath116li .",
    "for simplicity , we here assume that fe abundances in these three stars are quite similar to those in the well - mixed gas .",
    "the shaded area in fig.2 denotes the allowed relation between @xmath170 and @xmath85 , which accounts for the observed data of log(@xmath116li / h)@xmath177 at [ fe / h]@xmath178 presently obtained .",
    "the reported detections have rather large associated errors , which results in a large allowed region of parameter space .",
    "however , we should caution that the fe abundance of metal - poor stars has no one - to - one correspondence with age ( tsy , syk , and see more discussion in ",
    "[ sec : tmr ] ) .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to constrain the @xmath170-@xmath85 relation by comparing the @xmath0li data _ directly _ with the theoretical frequency distribution of the stellar [ fe / h]-log(@xmath116li / h ) plane ( see , e.g. , suzuki 1999 for a likelihood analysis of li ( @xmath116li+@xmath70li ) ) .",
    "precise determination of @xmath0li abundance in many metal - poor stars is highly desirable , as it will provide much stronger constraints on the adopted parameters of eps in the early galaxy .",
    "@xmath171be is produced only by the spallation of cno nuclei , which implies that the production rate depends on the cno abundance in both the ism and gcrs . at early epochs , because of the low abundance of cno nuclei in the ism , most of the @xmath171be is produced by gcr cno from sn ejecta spalling with @xmath179 in the ism ( see  [ sec : cmpcr ] ) .",
    "this implies that the @xmath13be production rate should depend linearly on the amount of ejected cno from sne .",
    "since our model considers no metallicity dependence of cno yields from sne , the @xmath13be production rate is proportional to the total amount of eps coming from sn ejecta .",
    "we define a proportionality coefficient    @xmath180    where @xmath181 is the energy used to accelerate gcrs originating from sn - ejecta .",
    "the first term is the energy ratio of gcrs coming from sn ejecta relative to the total gcrs , and is expressed in terms of the mass ratio as    @xmath182    where @xmath183 is the imf - weighted average of ejected mass from sne .",
    "the second term in eq . ( [ eqn : ejrt ] ) represents the contribution from the local eps (  [ sec : leps ] ) , denoted by the energy ratio of local to global eps .",
    "the reduction factor , @xmath184 , is introduced in order to take into account the effect that the @xmath171be production is reduced due to the adiabatic loss of eps in the snr .",
    "thus , as in the case of @xmath116li , the existent @xmath13be data can be used to derive the relation between @xmath170 and @xmath185 for a given value of @xmath186 .",
    "in contrast to @xmath116li , there are enough stars with measured @xmath13be abundances ( boesgaard 1999 ) .",
    "thus , it is possible to derive the @xmath170-@xmath85 relation by comparing the @xmath13be data with the theoretical frequency distribution of stars in the [ fe / h]-log(@xmath171be / h ) plane ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "solid lines in fig.2 show the allowed @xmath170-@xmath85 relation for various values of @xmath186 . since the spallation cross sections of cno producing @xmath13be have , more or less , a constant value ( only the spallation cross section of oxygen is shown for reference in the bottom panel of fig.1 ) , compared to those for the @xmath172 fusion producing @xmath0li , it is apparent that the allowed @xmath170-@xmath85 relation only weakly depends on the spectral index @xmath170 .    three free parameters ",
    "@xmath170 , @xmath85 , and @xmath186 , are constrained by the data for @xmath116li and @xmath171be , still leaving one degree of freedom .",
    "let us now return to previous work where the constraints on @xmath185 and @xmath170 are provided .",
    "the clearest constraint on the energy is that @xmath85 can not exceed the total kinetic energy of a sn explosion , @xmath187 .",
    "another , rather strong constraint , from recent simulations of shock acceleration is that @xmath188 of the explosion energy is absorbed by eps ( berezhko & v@xmath189lk 1997 ) in the snr .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to precisely determine @xmath43 in order to constrain @xmath85 .",
    "x - ray observations ( hughes , hayashi , & koyama 1998 ) of seven snrs in the large magellanic cloud show that the explosion energy of each sn exhibits a range of about one order of magnitude from @xmath190erg to @xmath191erg when the observed data are fit by a model using the sedov - taylor similarity solution . according to these authors , three of the seven snrs seem to have exploded within pre - existing cavities , thus the application of sedov model fits is in some doubt .",
    "the average value for remaining four snrs , which are thought to have exploded in the usual circumstances , is @xmath192erg , although these authors pointed out that this value is a lower limit , since they assumed spherically symmetric snrs , which results in the lowest estimate of @xmath43 .",
    "the case for their result of @xmath193erg with the numerical simulation ( berezhko & v@xmath189lk 1997 ) is indicated in fig .",
    "2 .    the spectral index can also be constrained from observations of high - energy particles on the earth s surface .",
    "the observed proton and helium spectra with energy above a few gev / a is best fit with @xmath194 ( burnett et al .",
    "1983 ; webber 1987 ; webber et al . 1987 ) , and the cno energy spectrum is almost identical ( e.g. , engelmann et al . 1985 ) .",
    "in order to explain the energy - dependent secondary / primary ratio of b / c , the present escape length , @xmath102 , of gcrs relies on the rigidity dependence , or equivalently , on the energy of incident eps , as far as elements with the same mass - to - charge ratio are considered . according to garcia - munoz ( 1987 ) , in the higher energy range of @xmath1951gev / a , it is expected that @xmath196 , while in the lower energy range the exact energy dependence of @xmath102 is difficult to obtain because of the strong influence of solar modulation . from the observed value of @xmath197 in the higher energy range ,",
    "a source spectral index is inferred to be @xmath198 , which is flatter than the results , @xmath199 , obtained from the data for elemental ratios of primary nuclei in 0.1 - 100 gev / a by webber ( 1992 ) and lukasiak ( 1994 ) , respectively .",
    "if the effect of re - acceleration of eps in the ism is taken into account , it is allowed that @xmath102 has lower rigidity dependence , leading to @xmath200 over the entire energy range ( seo & ptuskin 1994 ; strong & moskalenko 1998 ) .",
    "an inferred source spectrum depends on the strength of re - acceleration .",
    "for example , it is reported that @xmath201 ( seo , & ptuskin 1994 ) , and @xmath202 ( strong & moskalenko 1998 ) .",
    "numerical simulations of the shock acceleration in snrs also results in a variety of source spectra , with @xmath203 , depending on the physical state of the snr ( v@xmath204lk , zank , & zank 1988 ) .",
    "thus , it seems that a decisive constraint on the spectral index has not yet been obtained , due to the complicated influence of various loss and acceleration processes involving eps .",
    "moreover , these arguments are largely based on the observations in the current galactic disk , and the situation in the early galactic halo may be different .",
    "therefore , we presently place a conservative constraint that the source spectral index may fall between the flattest case ( @xmath205 ) and the observed one ( @xmath206 )  this is the allowed range shown in fig.2 .    in this paper",

    "this is because @xmath0li is produced by the fusion of uniformly distributed @xmath16 particles in the halo .",
    "figure 7 also shows that @xmath0li is the best candidate to be used as a cosmic clock , therefore it is highly desirable to increase the number of stars with measured @xmath0li abundance in the future .",
    "as discussed in  [ sec : ccpr ] , in order to explain the observed @xmath0li and be abundances in metal - poor stars , one sn had to provide @xmath256 erg to cosmic rays , even though we adopted a rather softer spectrum , @xmath176 , which can produce light elements more efficiently .",
    "this value of gcr energy per sn is higher than that required today , and is often discussed as being problematic ( pda , b ; ramaty 1997 , 2000 ) .",
    "the superbubble model was introduced ( higdon 1998 ; pdc ; ramaty et al .",
    "2000 ) as one possible way to achieve high efficiency of light - element production while not violating the energy requirements .",
    "according to detailed calculations by pdc , there are two reasons why superbubbles are suitable sites for effective production of the light elements .",
    "first , cno elements are more efficiently accelerated , because heavy elements ejected by successive explosions of many ( up to @xmath257 ) sne accumulate inside the superbubble , and the gas becomes much more metal rich ( approaching [ fe / h]@xmath258 ) as compared to the gas in the outer region ( [ fe / h]@xmath259 ) .",
    "these energetic cno nuclei will be spalled to produce light elements .",
    "second , the spectrum of eps in the superbubble is expected to be @xmath260 , where @xmath261 and @xmath80 is a few hundred mev ( bykov , & toptygin 1990 ; bykov 1995 ) . as a result , they more effectively produce light elements than the so - called momentum spectrum predicted from shock acceleration of the first - order fermi process ( blandford & ostriker 1978 ) . an important feature of this spectrum is an enhancement of eps in the low - energy region , around @xmath262 mev / a , where the cross sections to produce light elements , especially @xmath0li , have their maximum value ( the bottom panel of fig.1 ) .    here",
    ", we would like to compare the superbubble model with our inhomogeneous halo model with respect to gcr energetics . in fig .",
    "8 , adopting the spectral index @xmath170=2.7 , and the parameter @xmath77=0.007 , which determines the primary heavy gcrs (  [ sec : ccpr ] ) , we show the number of be and @xmath0li atoms produced per unit gcr energy ( atoms / erg ) for our model , overlayed with recent results of the superbubble model by ramaty et al .",
    "there are two primary differences between their superbubble model assumptions and our individual sn scenario with respect to the nature of the gcrs .",
    "one is the spectrum of the gcrs : ramaty et al .",
    "( 2000 ) use the spectrum of @xmath263 , where @xmath264 is the momentum of a particle and @xmath80 ( @xmath265 gev / a ) is the cut - off energy , calculated on the basis of multiple shock acceleration in superbubbles ( bykov 1995 ) , while ours is a so - called momentum spectrum ( eq.([eqn : crfx ] ) ) predicted from the fermi acceleration mechanism in the shock of individual snrs .",
    "the other difference is the assumed chemical composition of gcrs : the cno abundance by mass adopted in ramaty ( 2000 ) is almost as high as 0.1 , while that adopted in our model lies in the range 0.0050.01 during the entire epoch of early galactic halo ( fig .",
    "4 ) . it turns out that their adopted superbubble gcr spectrum yields a similar production quantity of the light elements as ours , since in the energy region 10100 mev / a , in which the light elements are produced the most efficiently , it is _ identical _ to the momentum spectrum .",
    "this is a result of ramaty ( 2000 ) adopting a higher cut - off energy ( @xmath7 10 gev / a ) than that in pdc .",
    "therefore , both the models yield almost the same number of @xmath0li atoms per unit gcr energy , much of which is produced by @xmath16 + @xmath16 fusion reactions in addition to the spallation of cno elements . on the other hand , the number of be atoms produced per unit gcr energy based on our model is as low as 10% of the results calculated by ramaty ( 2000 ) , because the cno abundance in gcrs adoped in our model is lower by about one order of magnitude than that adopted in their superbubble model .",
    "the efficiency of be production per unit gcr energy derived from our model is @xmath7 10@xmath213 of the superbubble model by ramaty ( 2000 ) .",
    "therefore , we adopted a higher energy input , @xmath266 erg , to gcrs per sn , but this value is only a factor of three higher than that adopted in their model ( @xmath267 ) .",
    "this is because the derived be abundance from their model is higher by a factor of three at the same [ fe / h ] than the results of our best - fit model to the observations .",
    "our adopted value of @xmath268 erg , though higher than the value of @xmath269 erg per sn required to maintain the energy density of cosmic rays in the current disk ( e.g. , i  4 in berezinski@xmath122 1990 ) , is not unacceptably high , given that the nature of snr in the early stage of an evolving halo might be completely different from those in the current disk , for the following reasons .",
    "first , metal - poor snrs suffer little from radiative losses because of the absence of metals , so they could survive for a longer period , and should be able to accelerate eps before losing power and dissipating .",
    "second , the snr shell could keep its identity until the late snr phase because merging with other shells could be avoided , owing to the low sn density in the early galactic halo  see  [ sec : intr ] for order of magnitude estimates .",
    "it is therefore expected that the acceleration of eps in the early halo should have been more efficient than for the current disk of the galaxy .",
    "the efficiency of acceleration of gcrs is expected to decrease from the early galaxy to the present level , as the abundance of heavy elements in the ism increases .",
    "therefore , in more sophisticated models , @xmath85 should be regarded as a variable with respect to cosmic time , or more precisely , with respect to the metallicity of the snr shells .",
    "the abundance pattern of heavy elements in metal - poor stars can distinguish between the superbubble model and our inhomogeneous halo model , because the prediction from the superbubble model is completely different from ours . according to pdc",
    ", the superbubble is surrounded by a very metal - poor shell composed of ism that is swept up by the expanding bubble . in the bubble ,",
    "heavy elements ejected by sne with various progenitor masses are mixed with the ism evaporating from the shell .",
    "since the timescale of mixing ( @xmath7 1 myr ) , estimated by the size of the bubbles divided by the sound velocity , is smaller than the timescale of evolution of the bubble ( @xmath7 30 myr ) , the chemical composition of the bubbles are expected to be quite homogeneous .",
    "an important result of superbubble model by pdc is that stars formed from the material of the bubble , diffusing into the metal - poor ism , should exhibit a constant abundance ratio for any combination of elements , for instance , be / fe , and o / fe , although their elemental abundances may vary , reflecting the progress of diffusion . on the other hand",
    ", our model predicts that stars formed in each snr shell , originating from various - mass sn progenitors , should exhibit a remarkable scatter in the abundance ratios of heavy elements .",
    "a realistic situation may not be so simple , because some stars may have formed in the superbubble environment , and some may have formed from individual snr shells , as recently discussed by parizot & drury ( 2000 ) .",
    "we suggest that observations of the element eu is one means by which these two models could be distinguished .",
    "the synthesized mass of eu in a sn decreases with increasing sn progenitor mass , an _ opposite _",
    "trend to the behavior of the majority of heavy elements , including fe ( shigeyama & tsujimoto 1998 ) .",
    "therefore , if _ all _ stars at early epochs were formed in individual snr shells , they must be distributed along a decreasing line of log(eu / fe ) as a function of [ fe / h ] ( see fig.3 of shigeyama & tsujimoto 1998 ) . on the other hand , if superbubbles are the dominant site of star formation in the early galaxy , most stars should have an identical eu / fe ratio , and be distributed along a horizontal line in the [ fe / h]-log(eu / fe ) plane .",
    "relevant data obtained by various observers ( mcwilliam 1995 , ryan 1996 , luck , & bond 1985 , gilroy 1988 , and magain 1989 ) seem to favor our model .",
    "however , this can not yet be taken as definitive evidence , because the reported data still have quite large errors .",
    "future observations , especially those with high accuracy , will hopefully clarify this picture .",
    "an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , which might have existed in the center of our galaxy , could have contributed to the early acceleration of eps .",
    "( production of light elements in agn was studied by baldwin 1977 and crosas & weisheit 1996 . )",
    "it has been argued from the observed number of qsos that these objects were very active at redshift @xmath270 and stopped their activities by the present time ( shaver 1996 ) .",
    "moreover , evolutionary trends of bright qsos slightly precedes ( richstone et al . 1998 ) the trend of cosmic star formation history ( madau 1996 ; madau , pozzetti , & dickinson 1998 ) .",
    "richstone ( 1998 ) interpreted this fact in such a way that the birth of qsos was associated with the formation of the spheroidal components of galaxies , and pre - dated the active phase of star formation through the evolution of galaxies .",
    "if this scenario is correct , the total energy of a galaxy was supplied first by an agn , then gradually by sne .",
    "it is naturally supposed , therefore , that most eps at early epochs were accelerated by an agn / qso source .",
    "observations of stellar motions in the region of the center of the galaxy show that the mass density at the very center is quite high ( @xmath271 ) , enough to accommodate a compact object like a massive blackhole ( genzel 1997 ) , possibly providing evidence of an early agn in the galaxy .",
    "there are two mechanisms which might conceivably supply sufficient energy to an agn / qso .",
    "one is a so - called fuel ( accretion - powered ) engine , and the other is a so - called fly - wheel ( rotation - powered ) engine ( nitta et al .",
    "1991 , nitta 1999 ) . while the energy supplied by the fuel engine is extracted from the gravitational energy released from an essentially _ infinite _ amount of the accreting matter , the energy supplied by the fly - wheel engine originates from _ finite _ amount of rotation energy of the central blackhole . in this scenario ,",
    "the luminosity of agn / qso is expected to evolve as follows : an agn / qso is extremely luminous just after being formed , because either engine is active , but after a certain period the fly - wheel engine ceases its activity when the rotation energy is exhausted .",
    "after that , the agn / qso becomes fainter , to a level as low as or less than the eddington luminosity .",
    "nitta ( 1999 ) discussed the statistical properties of the evolution of agn / qsos using the model of a kerr - blackhole engine . according to his work",
    ", a typical agn with mass of @xmath272 has a lifespan for the fly - wheel engine of @xmath7 1 gyr , which is , interestingly , similar to a typical time scale of the evolution of the galactic halo .",
    "the luminosity of such a typical qso / agn is about @xmath273 erg s@xmath274 , which is much larger than the energy input by sn explosions into the current disk ( @xmath275 erg s@xmath274 ) .",
    "even if the sn rate , or almost equivalently the sfr , was higher by a factor of several factors of ten in the past ( madau 1998 ) , a typical galactic nuclei could supply at least by 2 orders of magnitude more energy than the total sne in the galaxy at that time .",
    "other interesting results concerning activities of the galactic center have been obtained from x - ray observations ( koyama et al . 1996 ) , which detected the existence of a hot plasma containing @xmath276 erg in the central region .",
    "judging from the lifetime of the plasma ( @xmath277 yrs ) , these authors concluded that continuous energy generation of @xmath278 erg s@xmath274 is required , although a sn origin is implausible because of various observational facts .",
    "they also reported an emission line of iron in the cold molecular clouds near the galactic center , possibly due to irradiation from the center which was brighter in the very recent past ( @xmath7300 yrs ) .",
    "koyama et al .",
    "( 1996 ) argued from these observations that the galactic nucleus still has intermittent activity , with a time - averaged luminosity @xmath279 erg s@xmath274 , that might result from the the activity of a fuel engine ( accretion - powered ) blackhole .",
    "it should be noted that such a value is quite high , as compared to energy suppliers in our galaxy today , being almost comparable to the energy input from the total sn explosions in the present galactic disk ( @xmath275erg s@xmath274 ) .",
    "if the galactic nucleus was once very active , with the energy supplied from the rotation of the central blackhole and/or the accreting matter onto the blackhole , it is natural to imagine that eps accelerated in the shock around the agn would have enhanced the production of light elements at early epochs . adopting typical values of particle velocity @xmath280 @xmath281s@xmath274 and path length against ionization loss @xmath282 g@xmath283@xmath284 ( northcliffe & schilling 1971 ) for gcrs with @xmath285 mev / a , which most effectively produce the light elements ,",
    "we estimate the lifetime of these gcrs as @xmath286 where @xmath143 is the density of ambient gas , having a typical value of @xmath287 g@xmath283@xmath288 . with the diffusion coefficient @xmath289 @xmath290s@xmath274 for the galactic halo today",
    "( [ eq : difcr ] ) ) , these gcrs propagate over the distance of @xmath291 kpc away from the galactic center and are expected to enhance the production of light elements there .",
    "we now consider how these agn - accelerated gcrs could affect the chemical evolution of `` clumpy '' clouds which make up the entire galactic halo at early epochs .",
    "studies of the kinematics of stars in the solar neighborhood indicate that metal - poor halo stars have a variety of orbital eccentricities spanning from @xmath292 to 1 , whereas metal - rich disk stars rotate in almost circular orbits of @xmath292 in the galactic disk ( yoshii & saio 1979 ; norris , bessell , & pickles 1985 ; chiba & yoshii 1997 ) .",
    "about 70% of nearby halo stars with [ fe / h]@xmath293 have orbits with @xmath294 ( chiba & beers 2000 ) which are accessible to the region of central few kiloparsecs , given that the solar distance is 8.5 kpc from the galactic center .",
    "the observed orbital eccentricities of halo stars more or less reflect the initial motion of clouds from which such stars were born , because their orbital angular momentum is preserved , with only rare interactions between the gas and other stars . even if dissipation processes have played a role , initial clouds were dynamically in a more chaotic state , having more chances to pass through the central galaxy in the past .",
    "accordingly , many halo stars observed in the solar vicinity today were born from clouds which could pass through the central galaxy at least once in an orbital period @xmath295 .",
    "since @xmath295 should be comparable to the dynamical timescale of the galaxy @xmath296 yr , we obtain the following inequalities : @xmath297 where @xmath298 is a typical duration of the formation of the galactic halo , and @xmath299 is the typical timescale of cloud evolution , characterized by the lifetime of @xmath300 stars inducing the formation of new stars (  [ sec : gcr ] ) .",
    "the first inequality in eq . ( [ eq : agnev ] ) indicates that the clouds could have passed near the center of the galaxy at least 10 times during the halo phase .",
    "given that agn activity lasts for @xmath301 gyr , the chemical evolution of the clouds is affected by agn - accelerated gcrs about 10 times , and the production of light elements is intermittently enhanced once in every @xmath302 yr . because of the random and chaotic motion of the clouds , the light elements originating as a result of agn activity are distributed over the entire halo , although their production site is confined in the central few kiloparsecs . as a result , the light - element abundance of halo stars would have been increased more rapidly , compared to the case of an exclusive sne origin .",
    "the trend of be and b abundances with metallicity would be flatter than quadratic , and the trend of @xmath0li would be even flatter than linear .",
    "these expected consequences are similar to the model prediction by yoshii et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , under the assumption that the gcr flux was higher in the past , owing to more effective confinement of gcrs in the early galaxy .",
    "the second inequality in eq . ( [ eq : agnev ] ) indicates that the agn - accelerated gcrs affect the production of light elements intermittently on longer timescales , compared to that of the stellar generations induced by sne . as a result",
    ", the trend of light - element abundance might not be expected to be a a simple function of metallicity .",
    "although precise estimates of this extra agn effect required more detailed modeling of the evolution of clumpy clouds in the galactic halo , it is expected that the light - element abundance could still be used as an age indicator , because gcrs originating from the agn propagate as uniformly in the clouds as those from sne (  [ sec : gcr ] ) .",
    "a model describing the chemical evolution of the light elements has been constructed by incorporating the inhomogeneous nature in the galactic halo , characterized by sn - induced star formation processes (  [ mdlgce ] ) , as well as the contribution of global gcrs and local eps in the snr (  [ sec : gcr ] and  [ sec : leps ] ) .",
    "we have calculated the stellar frequency distribution in the [ fe / h ] _ vs. _",
    "log(@xmath220/h ) plane , which reproduces well the observed scatter of elemental abundances in halo stars (  [ sec : cmpobs ] ) .",
    "inspection of the frequency distribution of stars as a function of their age (  [ sec : tmr ] ) indicates that the abundance of light elements is well - correlated with time .",
    "based on our model , @xmath0li is the best cosmic clock , and @xmath13be is the second - best clock . we have discussed the allowed combination of various parameters for gcrs / eps , inferred from observations of @xmath0li and @xmath13be abundances in metal - poor stars (  [ sec : ccpr ] ) .",
    "although there exist concordant values for these parameters which account for the observed abundance of light elements in metal - poor stars , more energy to accelerate eps is necessary in the early stage of the galaxy , compared to that required to maintain gcrs in the current disk .",
    "we have discussed the energetics of gcrs with respect to the production of the light elements in comparison with the supperbubble scenario , which has alternatively been considered as a site of light element production in metal - poor stars . we further have argued that observations of the eu abundance in extremely metal - poor stars are capable of distinguishing our inhomogeneous halo model from the supperbubble model (  [ sec : sbmd ] ) .",
    "we have proposed the hypothesis of agn activity in our galaxy as one source of energy supply at early epochs , and presented a rough model of the production of the light elements in the galactic halo arising from agn activity (  [ sec : agn ] ) .",

    "<S> we present predictions of the evolution of the light elements , li , be , and b , in the early epochs of the galactic halo , using a model of supernova - induced chemical evolution based on contributions from supernovae ( sne ) and cosmic rays ( crs ) , as recently proposed by tsujimoto and suzuki . </S>",
    "<S> this model has the great advantage of treating various elements self - consistently , even under inhomogeneous conditions , as might arise from stochastic star formation processes triggered by sn explosions . </S>",
    "<S> the most important prediction from our model is that the abundances of light elements in extremely metal - poor stars might be used as age indicators in the very early stages of an evolving halo population , at times when the abundances of heavy elements ( `` metallicity '' ) in most stars are dominated by local metal enrichment due to nearby sn events , and is poorly correlated with age .    </S>",
    "<S> plots of the expected frequency distribution of stars in the age _ vs. _ </S>",
    "<S> elemental abundance diagram show that the best `` cosmic clock '' is the @xmath0li abundance . </S>",
    "<S> we have derived relationships among various cosmic - ray parameters such as energy input to crs by sne , the spectral shape of the crs , and the chemical composition in crs , and find that we can reproduce very well recent observations of @xmath0li , be , and b in metal - poor stars . </S>",
    "<S> although our model is successful for certain sets of cosmic - ray parameters , larger energy should be absorbed by energetic particles from each sn than required to the current situation of galactic disk . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss an alternative hypothesis of agn activity in the early galaxy as another possible accelerator of crs .    3  cm^-3 </S>"
