    "the chern - simons - witten ( csw ) theory has been providing many interesting topics for both mathematics and physics .",
    "different aspects of the theory have been explored , e.g. abelian and non - abelian theory with the chern - simons term , supersymmetric extension , and pure theory .",
    "specifically , after it was pointed out that the pure theory could be relevant for knot theory @xcite , many researchers have contributed to clarify the relation of csw theory to two - dimensional , conformal field theories and to knot theory .",
    "witten described the exact solution to this theory in non - perturbative case .",
    "he and others also showed that there is relation between this theory and the polynomial or quantum group invariants of knot in three dimensions , in particular the jones polynomial and its generalizations like the homfly and the kauffman polynomial invariants @xcite .",
    "these knot polynomials can be regarded as vacuum expectation values ( vev ) of wilson loop operators in this theory .",
    "the csw theory also has interesting features from the perturbative point of view and lead to goussarov - vassiliev or finite type invariants .",
    "moreover , witten s idea was based on the validity of the path integral formulation of the quantized theory . by examining the existence of a quantum field theory description of the link invariants in perturbative framework , it turned out that the coefficients of the perturbative series correspond to these invariants .",
    "the perturbative expansion of the path integral of the theory has been considered for flat @xmath7 @xcite and for general three - manifolds @xcite .",
    "subsequently , there was much attention given to understanding the perturbative series for knots and links in @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the perturbative series expansion has been studied for different gauge - fixings which lead to different representations for vassiliev invariants .",
    "the covariant landau gauge corresponds to the configuration space integrals and the non - covariant light - cone gauge to the kontsevich integrals .",
    "another studies of the perturbative series expansion in the non - covariant temporal gauge has the important feature that the integrals which are present in the expressions for the coefficients of the perturbative series expansion can be carried out . in this case one",
    "obtains combinatorial expressions , instead of integral ones , for vassiliev invariants and this has been shown to be the case up to order four @xcite .",
    "perturbative expansion in other gauges might also highlight other aspects of the theory , for example in axial gauge @xcite and in light - cone gauge @xcite .",
    "the invariants obtained in the perturbative framework with different gauge - fixing are the same since the theory is gauge invariant and wilson loops are gauge invariant operators .",
    "one main issue in perturbative csw theory is the calculability of the vacuum expectation value of wilson loop operator @xmath8 in the three - dimensional field theory framework .",
    "it turned out that @xmath9 has a meaningful perturbative expansion in powers of the coupling constant @xmath10 .",
    "although by power counting the theory appears renormalizable , it is in fact uv finite , which means the @xmath11 function and the anomalous dimensions of the fields vanish to all orders @xcite . even , more interestingly , there is no divergences in the computation of @xmath9 in this theory .",
    "one loop renormalization constant of the theory has been calculated and the result showed the existence of the famous @xmath12 shift @xcite .",
    "therefore , the framing has nothing to do with divergences of @xmath9 , but is related to the self - linking problem which is topological in origin .    the mathematical establishment of relations between csw gauge theory , topological theories in 3 manifold and knot theory is still making progress .",
    "some recent studies include the application of maldacena s conjecture @xcite , the use of methods of stochastic analysis @xcite and its connection to the penner models @xcite .",
    "in this paper we will evaluate the non - perturbative as well as the perturbative aspects of csw theory . in non - perturbative aspect",
    ", it is shown that the vev of wilson loop operators are evaluated by using braiding formula @xcite which is useful to construct algebraic relations between unknotted wilson loop operators .",
    "it also discussed the emergence of the extended wilson loop operators , namely baryon type @xcite and tetrahedron operators @xcite .",
    "especially , we will evaluate the tetrahedron type operator .",
    "this diagram emerges by refining the calculation of the gravitational scattering amplitude in previous work @xcite .",
    "it is important , therefore , to make it clear what contributions will be supplied from these terms .    on the other hand , parallel to the non - perturbative approach",
    ", the explicit perturbative calculation of the unknotted wilson loop operator is presented up to the third order .",
    "the coefficients of these expansion is shown to be the same as the non - perturbative results .",
    "after that , we also investigate the ghost and auxiliary fields contributions to the wilson loop operator .",
    "a detailed perturbative calculation of the ghost contribution up to the second order is given in the appendix a and other important integral formulas related to the framing procedure are given in appendix b.",
    "in this section we will present the rudimentary facts about csw theory and to discuss the emergence of extended wilson loop operators . the action for this theory in @xmath0-dimension is the chern - simons secondary characteristic class defined by @xmath13 here @xmath10 plays the role of coupling constant whereas @xmath14 is a connection on a @xmath15-bundle @xmath16 over a space - time three manifold @xmath17 .",

    "the wilson loop operators @xmath22 , which are the basic observables of the theory , are the most important gauge invariant operators in this theory .",
    "these operators are related to the link invariants of knot theory and defined by the trace of path - ordered exponential of the connection @xmath14 along a closed loop @xmath23 which is embedded in @xmath17 , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a representation of the gauge group @xmath15 ( @xmath26 is its conjugate representation ) .",
