    "recent advances in the angular resolved photoemission technique ( arpes ) have allowed to determine electronic excitations of some high-@xmath9 materials .",
    "two different approaches to photoemission are currently used . in type",
    "i arpes one measures @xmath10 the probability that an excitation of fixed momentum @xmath11 has an energy @xmath12 in the type ii arpes one measures the probability @xmath1 that an excitation of fixed energy @xmath13 has a momentum @xmath14*. * using the latter technique on the high - temperature superconductor b2212 , aebi et al.@xcite have found , in addition to the main fermi surface ( f. s. ) , another f. s. that is identical to the first one but of much smaller intensity and displaced from the main f. s. by the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) wave vector @xmath15 .",
    "this structure has been taken as evidence for the existence of the `` shadow bands '' that had been predicted much earlier by kampf and schrieffer @xcite .",
    "these authors had argued that precursors of the afm bands should appear in the paramagnetic state close to the afm instability .",
    "more recently , observation of dispersing shadow bands has been also reported in type i photoemission experiments @xcite .",
    "however , the afm interpretation of the phenomenon observed in b2212 remains controversial because : i ) the afm correlation length @xmath16 in optimally doped b2212 is rather short @xcite , ii ) the effect has not been found yet in any other high - temperature superconductor or in the underdoped b2212 iii ) it becomes more pronounced when one increase orthorombicity by lead doping @xcite .",
    "all these leave open the possibility of structural origin of the phenomenon observed in refs .",
    "it is thus very important to understand under which general conditions shadow bands can occur in practice .",
    "some aspects of this issue have been considered in a number of recent theoretical publications@xcite-@xcite . in particular , the strong coupling numerical calculations for the t - j model @xcite show peaks outside non - interacting f. s. in the underdoped case for @xmath17 .",
    "however , these results have been obtained so far only for very small clusters and the results close to optimal doping are unclear @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "i study under which general conditions shadow bands can occur , using a well known method that can be justified up to intermediate coupling .",
    "i show that there are , in fact , a few different precursors effects due to the proximity to afm instability depending on whether the effect is due to classical @xmath18 or quantum @xmath19 spin fluctuations ( here @xmath6 is characteristic energy of spin fluctuations ) .",
    "i also show that shadow effects in type i and type ii photoemission experiments may occur under different conditions . for type",
    "i arpes experiments , i find that while classical spin fluctuations can produce dispersive shadow effects in @xmath20 , quantum spin fluctuations can not .",
    "the key difference between both regimes is that classical thermal fluctuations lead to precursors of the magnetic bragg peaks in the _",
    "static _ spin structure factor , while the dynamical nature of quantum spin fluctuations does not allow sharp structures in @xmath21 , no matter how large @xmath22 is ( @xmath23 lattice constant ) .",
    "consequently , shadow effects will appear in type i experiments at low temperature only if the afm correlation length @xmath16 has the appropriate temperature dependence , not just when @xmath22 is large enough .",
    "this conclusion is qualitatively different from the results of numerical studies @xcite-@xcite , in which it was tacitly assumed that the effect is determined by the parameter @xmath24 . alone .",
    "it is only in type ii arpes experiments that quantum spin fluctuations can lead to a non - dispersive shadow feature in @xmath25@xcite .",
    "i find , however , that the latter effect is very small and exists only in a narrow range near zero energy .",
    "more experimental implications of my results are discussed in the conclusion .",
    "i evaluate the effect of spin fluctuations on the electronic self - energy in the one - loop approximation .",
    "the expression for the self - energy has the form : @xmath26}{\\omega -\\omega ^{\\prime } -\\tilde \\varepsilon ( \\vec k+\\vec q)+i0 } \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the spin susceptibility , @xmath28 is the effective coupling constant between electrons and spin fluctuations and @xmath29 is the energy dispersion relative to the chemical potential .",
    "the constant vertex corrections are included in @xmath30 .",
    "it was shown within the hubbard model@xcite , that by including vertex corrections in this way the above self - energy expression ( [ sigreal ] ) remains a good approximation up to intermediate coupling .",
    "close to afm instability the low - energy asymptotic form of the spin susceptibility @xmath31 can be written in the orstein - zhernike form : @xmath32 where @xmath16 is the afm correlation length and @xmath6 is the characteristic energy of the spin fluctuations . any rpa - like theory , whether it uses bare or renormalized vertices @xcite or propagators @xcite ,",
    "have the orstein - zhernike form close to @xmath33 . in the context of high-@xmath9 materials , the orstein - zhernike susceptibility with particular set of parameters",
    "is often called mmp susceptibility .",
    "it has been used to fit a number of experiments , that are sensitive to the strong enhancement of @xmath34 around @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "here , i will adopt a more general approach and consider for which general conditions on the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath6 the precursors of afm bands can exist .",
    "since shadow effects come from the peak in @xmath34 around @xmath33 , the orstein - zhernike form of @xmath34 is sufficient for my purposes and its simplicity will allow me to obtain a number of results analytically .",
    "the imaginary part of the susceptibility @xmath35 has to be cut off at some high frequency @xmath36 in order to satisfy the local moment sum rule . in electronic models",
    "this cutoff is of the order of a few hopping integrals @xmath37 for the low energy physics the precise value of @xmath36 is not important .",
    "i use @xmath38 .    from a microscopic point of view ( see , for example,@xcite ) , the parameters in the susceptibility eq.([susc1 ] ) scale with the correlation length as : @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "consequently the model is defined by only three parameters @xmath16 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "qualitatively , our results mainly depend on @xmath16 and on @xmath43 while the parameter @xmath44 ( in the hubbard model @xcite @xmath45 ) determines the quantitative scale of the effects . to model the band - structure of the hole - doped high - tc materials i use the simplest tight - binding model that correctly reproduces the experimentally observed fermi surfaces in ybco and b2212 at optimal doping , namely @xmath46 with @xmath47 ( i set @xmath48 ) .",
    "the band structure estimate for @xmath49 is about @xmath50 . using this approach ,",
    "i first present numerical results and then analytically find the conditions for the existence of the various effects .",
    "both the self - energy and the spectral function @xmath51 $ ] are discussed .",
    "the chemical potential of the interacting electrons is found from the usual condition @xmath52 .",
    "i choose @xmath53 that corresponds to optimal doping in b2212 @xcite .",
    "i start with numerical results and figures that illustrate various points i wish to make .",
    "analytical results for various regimes identified in the numerical examples appear in a subsequent section .",
    "the important aspect of critical afm fluctuations is that they lead to strongly @xmath54-dependent self - energy .",
    "the maximum of the scattering rate @xmath55 at finite temperature occurs on the so - called shadow fermi surface ( sh . f. s. ) .",
    "the latter is _ defined _ here as the set of points obtained by the translation of the real f. s. by the wave vector @xmath56 .",
    "the inset in fig.[cross](a ) shows the real f.s . and the sh .",
    "f. s. for the optimally doped materials .",
    "the points at which the real f. s. and the sh .",
    "f. s. intersect are the points at which the spectral function @xmath57 is affected the most by spin fluctuations .",
    "i start the analysis with these crossing points , @xmath58 also known as hot spots .",
    "the filled line on fig.[cross ] shows the spectral function @xmath59 in the regime dominated by classical thermal fluctuations ( @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) .",
    "we see that instead of the usual quasi - particle peak at @xmath63 there are two precursors of the antiferromagnetic bands with a pseudogap between them .",
    "these bands are associated with two new quasiparticle solutions of the equation @xmath64 .",
    "it is because these solutions exist that the term _ bands _ is used .",
    "i also find that in this case the scattering rate @xmath65 has maximum at the fermi level @xmath63 .",
    "i will show now by contradiction , that this effect exists only if @xmath66 increases sufficiently rapidly with decreasing temperature . indeed , suppose the correlation length does not increase when temperature decreases below the temperature @xmath67 used for the filled line on fig.[cross ] .",
    "taking a much smaller temperature @xmath68 while keeping all other parameters fixed , the dashed line on fig.[cross ] shows that the pseudogap in @xmath69 disappears while the quasiparticle peak reappears .",
    "i find similar results when i keep the temperature and @xmath16 constant but increase @xmath6 up to @xmath70 .",
    "this means that the pseudogap in @xmath71 can exist only if the correlation length @xmath66 increases sufficiently rapidly at low temperature .",
    "i show below that @xmath72 is a sufficient condition .",
    "the latter condition is realized in the renormalized classical regime ( r. c. ) @xmath73 that always precedes the @xmath17 phase transition in two dimensions .      in this direction , real and shadow f.s .",
    "are well separated and @xmath75 is large .",
    "the filled curve in fig.[diag1 ] shows the spectral function at @xmath61 for a wave vector @xmath76 that is just a little bit inside the sh .",
    "f.  s. ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "the quasiparticle peak in this case is at large positive energies and can not be seen in the photoemission experiments since they measure @xmath78 .",
    "there is no new quasiparticle solution to @xmath79 in this case .",
    "nevertheless , there is a local maximum at negative binding energies ( shown by arrow ) that coincides with the maximum in the imaginary part , @xmath80 in fig .",
    "[ diag1]b .",
    "i call this a shadow _ feature .",
    "_ this maximum occurs because for large values of @xmath81 the quantity @xmath82 is large and slowly varying in the region where @xmath83 acquires a maximum .",
    "hence , this maximum is directly reflected in the spectral function that becomes proportional to @xmath84 rather than inversely proportional to it as in the case of quasiparticles .",
    "this maximum occurs at @xmath85 , a dispersion that looks like the afm band but with the gap equal to zero .",
    "nevertheless , this is definitely _ not _ a real afm band since a ) it is thermally excited ( see below ) b ) it exists only in certain regions of @xmath14-space where @xmath86 .",
    "note that similar shadow features have been found in the hubbard model with @xmath87 , using the flex approximation@xcite .    to show that this shadow feature is a thermally excited state i plot the dashed line in fig.[diag1 ] for the case where",
    "the temperature is decreased to @xmath88 with all other parameters the same as for @xmath61 .",
    "clearly the shadow feature ( shown by arrow ) disappears at lower temperature .",
    "it also disappears for @xmath89 .",
    "i note that the maximum in @xmath90 around @xmath91 is different from the `` shadow band '' observed in ref.@xcite .",
    "it stays at @xmath92 even when @xmath14 crosses the sh .",
    "f. s ..      the above considerations lead to the conclusion that only classical thermal spin fluctuations that destroy long range order at @xmath94 in two dimensions can produce the above dispersive shadow peaks in both type i and type ii experiments .",
    "quantum spin fluctuations @xmath19 alone can not produce shadow effect in @xmath10 measured in type i arpes , no matter how large is @xmath22 .",
    "however , in the type ii configuration , ( @xmath14_-dependence _ of @xmath95 , quantum spin fluctuations can lead to a non - dispersive shadow feature at @xmath96 when @xmath97 ( ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the effect is due to the enhancement of @xmath98 on the sh.f.s . at finite @xmath99 . for small @xmath99",
    "the maximum in @xmath100 translates into a maximum in @xmath101 at @xmath102 , since @xmath103 for @xmath14 far from the f.s .. since @xmath104 at @xmath17 , one needs to increase @xmath99 to have a noticeable weight for this maximum in the incoherent background .",
    "however , when @xmath99 increases the width of the maximum in @xmath105-space rapidly increases and above a certain energy @xmath106 , mainly determined by @xmath107 , the maximum disappears .",
    "this occurs because the effect from @xmath108 is offset by the contribution from the denominator in @xmath109 . for @xmath110 , the closer",
    "@xmath111 is to the real f. s. the larger @xmath20 is .",
    "this is illustrated in the inset of fig.[diag1 ] .",
    "i found that the effect is always very small even for large values of @xmath16 and @xmath112 .",
    "for values of @xmath113 and @xmath114 which are typical for cuprates closed to the optimal doping @xcite it does not exist even at very small @xmath115 .",
    "i now explain analytically why the effect of classical and quantum afm fluctuation on @xmath20 are qualitatively different .",
    "when @xmath60 the effect of spin fluctuations on single - particle properties can be considered quasistatic . indeed , neglecting @xmath116 in the energy denominator of the self - energy formula",
    "( [ sigreal ] ) one obtains @xcite :    @xmath117    where @xmath118 is the the static structure factor @xmath119 .",
    "the key point is that in the rc regime , @xmath118 has the _ same _ singular behavior as the static susceptibility @xmath120 because for @xmath121 , @xmath122 . since close to the afm instability @xmath120 is a lorentzian peaked at @xmath123 , the static structure factor @xmath118 has a lorentzian maximum in the regime @xmath18 :    @xmath124    the presence of a sharp precursor of the bragg peak in the rc regime leads to the shadow peak in @xmath125 .",
    "the situation is qualitatively different in the case @xmath19 and @xmath97 . in that case ,",
    "@xmath126 and using eq . ( [ susc1 ] )",
    "i obtain :    @xmath127\\ ] ]    the logarithmic singularity of @xmath118 in the case @xmath128 is integrable and does not lead to any divergence in @xmath129 when @xmath130 .",
    "consequently , there is no shadow effects in @xmath125 , when electrons approach the afm instability @xmath131 at zero temperature @xmath17 .",
    "this conclusion is different from the result of kampf and schrieffer@xcite who used the zero temperature formalism and found shadow bands for @xmath132 .",
    "the difference is due to the fact that the phenomenological susceptibility used in ref.@xcite was separable in @xmath133 and @xmath99 , @xmath134 . in that case , the @xmath135dependence of the static structure factor @xmath118 is _ always _ the same as that of the susceptibility @xmath120 .",
    "consequently , the static structure factor @xmath136 has a lorentzian - like peak even when @xmath19 .",
    "the separability in @xmath99 and @xmath133 of the susceptibility is an oversimplication that can be partially justified only in the regime @xmath18 .",
    "thus , the results of ref.@xcite should not be applied to the zero - temperature paramagnetic state .",
    "the asymptotic form of @xmath137 in the rc regime has been obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case @xmath138 , @xmath139 the generalization to the present case is straightforward and for @xmath108 i get , for @xmath140 : @xmath141 ^2+v_{\\vec{k}+\\vec{q}% } ^2\\xi ^{-2 } } }   \\label{sigi}\\ ] ] we see that @xmath80 has a maximum when @xmath142 with @xmath143 .",
    "the effect is largest at the van hove point @xmath144 , in which case @xmath145 .",
    "since away from @xmath146 , we have @xmath147 , we obtain for @xmath148 , the shadow feature discussed above . on the other hand , at the crossing points @xmath149 , @xmath150 and",
    "the enhancement in @xmath151 leads to the afm pseudogap with no quasiparticle peak inside .",
    "this is similar to what was found in the case of perfect nesting ( @xmath138 , @xmath87 ) @xcite , except that in the latter case the pseudogap opens up over all the f.s .",

    "and the sh.f.s coincide ( all points on the f.s .",

    "the effect exists in @xmath159 in the r.  c. regime @xmath160 . since in the weak - to - intermediate coupling regime",
    "@xmath161 is of the order of the gap @xmath162 in the ordered state , the condition @xmath163 can be also written as @xmath164 , where @xmath165 is the coherence length in the ordered state . in three dimensions precursors of afm are very weak @xcite because the integration of eq.([sigs ] ) gives in 3d @xmath166 ^ 2+v_{\\vec{k}+\\vec{q}}^2\\xi ^{-2}\\right ] $ ] , which is much less singular then in two - dimensional case eq.([sigi ] ) . in the dimensions",
    "@xmath167 the precursors of afm bands do not appear even at the very point of the phase transition , because of the large phase space in eqs.([sigreal]),([sigs ] ) .",
    "this result could be expected on general physical grounds , since in three and larger dimensions the gap is equal to zero at the nel temperature . in contrast , in two - dimensions classical thermal fluctuations suppress long - range order at finite temperature and at the @xmath17 phase transition the system goes directly into the ordered state with a _",
    "finite _ gap .",
    "finally , i note that the one - dimensional case is , as usual , very special . for the most recent studies of shadow bands in the 1d case see @xcite .",
    "i have shown that in 2d there are a few different antiferromagnetic precursor effects in the spectral function @xmath20 , which are realized under different physical conditions .",
    "the conditions for dispersive shadow features and shadow bands are given by @xmath18 and @xmath168 .",
    "the first conditions insures that the short - range afm order is _ quasi - static _ , which means that not only the susceptibility @xmath169 has a lorentzian form at @xmath170 , but also the static structure factor @xmath21 has this form .",
    "the second condition @xmath163 implies that the afm correlation length should be compared with the thermal wave length @xmath171 of electrons , rather then with the lattice constant @xmath23 , as was assumed in some previous works on shadow bands .",
    "the above conditions for dispersive shadow bands can be realized in two - dimensions when at @xmath17 there is long - range afm order .",
    "the situation is favorable in two dimension because this is the lower critical dimension for the afm instability and the mean field phase transition is replaced by the crossover @xmath161 to the regime with very rapidly growing correlation length @xmath172 for @xmath173 .",
    "the dispersive shadow features and shadow bands are closely related to one another .",
    "when the correlation length starts to increase faster than @xmath174 ( @xmath175 at van hove point ) the shadow bands appear first at the hot spots , while shadow features appear at the wave vectors @xmath176 away from the fermi surface .",
    "when the correlation length increases further the shadow feature is eventually replaced by the shadow band . in this context , the thermally excited shadow feature could be considered as a precursor of the shadow band .    the theory predicts no dispersive shadow features or shadow bands at zero temperature no matter how large is the correlation length .",
    "i note that the reason for the absence of dispersive shadow peaks at @xmath17 is similar to the reason for the absence of shadow peaks in higher dimensions , namely , large phase space .",
    "indeed , in the matsubara formalism the imaginary axis plays the role of an additional dimension at @xmath17 , since @xmath177 .",
    "in addition to the dispersive shadow peaks which exist in both @xmath14 and @xmath99 scans of the spectral function , there is also a non - dispersive shadow feature @xcite in the @xmath178scan only of @xmath25 .",
    "the latter effect is due to the _ dynamical _ quantum spin fluctuation and it exists at zero temperature and finite frequency if @xmath16 is sufficiently large .    _",
    "experimental implications : _ close to optimal doping the increase of @xmath179 with temperature is well described by the mean - field curie - weiss law @xmath180 , i. e. slower than @xmath175 . under those conditions , the present theory does not predict any dispersive shadow feature or shadow band .",
    "i also found that the non - dispersive shadow feature due to quantum fluctuations@xcite in @xmath1 is always a very small effect .",
    "i did not find such shadow feature for the conditions of the type ii experiment of aebi et al.@xcite .",
    "i conclude that , based on the present approach , the `` shadow bands '' observed in b2212 close to optimal doping @xcite can not be explained as precursors of afm bands .",
    "the structural explanation of the `` shadow bands '' in optimally doped materials , have been suggested in ref.@xcite ( see also comment @xcite ) .",
    "i suggest that precursors of afm bands should be searched for in strongly underdoped materials in the rc regime @xmath160 .",
