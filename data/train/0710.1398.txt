    "we consider a simple model of concurrent processes in computer systems , or more generally , a logical representation of the physical universe that consists of causal sequences of events occurring at different spatial locations .",
    "these locations are here referred to as _",
    "sites_. formally , a site is a sequence of processes ordered by the happened - before relation .",
    "the term _ process _ denotes one of the continuing states in a site , including in particular nothing happening states .",
    "it is also assumed for simplicity that ( i ) the processes in each site occur consecutively with no time gaps , ( ii ) each process lasts for some non - zero time duration .",

    "for the later comparison , this section is devoted to introduce a formalization of time in non - relativistic situations .",
    "the earliest such treatment is due to russel ( 1926 ) .",
    "since we assume that any process is not instantaneous , but occupies some non - zero time duration , we can say that a process @xmath0 _ is earlier than _ a process @xmath1 if @xmath0 ends before @xmath1 begins , and that @xmath0 _ is simultaneous with _",

    "the collection of all time points is denoted by @xmath2 , i.e.    @xmath3    where * proc * denotes the set of all processes , @xmath4 denotes the power set of * proc * ( the set of all subsets of * proc * ) , and @xmath5 denotes the simultaneity relation .    in fig .",
    "2 , we have @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "the broken lines represent the simultaneous time points .",
    "2 ]    it is worth noting that the happened - before relation on * proc * defines a linear ordering on @xmath2 . for any distinct time points @xmath18 and @xmath19",
    ", there must be a process @xmath0 that is in @xmath18 but not in @xmath19 , and a process @xmath20 that is in @xmath19 but not in @xmath18 . by the definition of time point , either of the following holds : `` @xmath0 is earlier than @xmath20 '' or `` @xmath20 is earlier than @xmath0 . '' in the former case let @xmath21 and in the latter case @xmath22 .",
    "time points are used to introduce the concept of _ time intervals .",
    "_ for each process @xmath0 , its time interval @xmath23 $ ] is defined as the set of all time points that contain @xmath0 , i.e.    @xmath24 \\equiv \\ { t \\in { \\cal p } \\,\\,|\\,\\ , p \\in t \\}\\textrm{.}\\ ] ]    in fig .",

    "an atomic proposition @xmath0 asserts that _ the process @xmath0 is occurring .",
    "_ complex propositions are built out of atomic propositions and logical connectives :    * for any proposition @xmath0 , @xmath29 denotes the proposition that the proposition @xmath0 is not true .",
    "the truth value of @xmath29 is defined as @xmath30 \\equiv { \\cal p } - [ \\ , p\\ , ] $ ] ( set - theoretic complement relative to @xmath2 ) , which amounts to the time interval that @xmath0 is not true . *",
    "for any propositions @xmath0 and @xmath1 , @xmath31 denotes the proposition that the propositions @xmath0 and @xmath1 are both true .",
    "the truth value of @xmath31 is defined as @xmath32 \\equiv [ \\ , p\\ , ] \\cap [ \\ , q\\ , ] $ ] ( set - theoretic intersection ) , which amounts to the time interval that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are both true . * for any propositions @xmath0 and @xmath1 , @xmath33 denotes the proposition that at least one of the propositions @xmath0 and @xmath1 is true .",
    "the truth value of @xmath33 is defined as @xmath34 \\equiv [ \\ , p\\ , ] \\cup [ \\ , q\\ , ] $ ] ( set - theoretic union ) , which amounts to the time interval that at least one of @xmath0 and @xmath1 is true .",
    "since the operations coincide with the usual set - theoretic ones , it is obvious that the resulting logic is boolean .",
    "in the preceding section , we have implicitly assumed the existence of the global clock , which is represented by the linearly arranged time points .",
    "however , the classical concept of simultaneity loses its meaning in a real distributed system or a relativistic universe .",
    "what the principle of special relativity says is that it does take a non - zero time duration to transmit any causal signals between spatially separated sites ( for a basic reference , see taylor ( 1992 ) ) . as shown in fig .",
    "3 , we refer to any signal capable of transmitting information between sites as a _",
    "message_.      while a message transmission is needed to synchronize two clocks at different sites , the transmission time duration is not measurable without reference to synchronized clocks located at both sites ; it is a vicious circle .",
    "hence we must abandon the attempt to provide the global time points , i.e. the clock common to all sites . thus the simultaneity based on the overlap relation can not be defined since it can not generally be determined whether two processes at different sites overlap temporally .",
    "we should therefore focus on the special cases where we can say with certainty that two or more processes run simultaneously . in simple cases where a message is sent from a site @xmath35 to a site @xmath36 and then another message",
    "is sent back from @xmath36 to @xmath35 , it is verifiable that the processes in @xmath35 that occur consecutively with no time gaps between the sending event and the receiving event _ temporally contain _ the processes in @xmath36 that occur between the receiving event and the sending event .        to sum up , a relativistic universe admits simultaneity only in the sense of temporal containment shown in fig 5 . in the following discussion",
    ", we drop the idea of defining time interval via simultaneous time points , but directly construct the logic employing temporal containment relation between processes .",
    "we say that two processes have a _ causal relationship _ in a relativistic universe if they are linked with the happened - before relation ( lamport , 1978 ) .",
    "the happened - before relation @xmath38 on * proc * is defined as the smallest relation satisfying the following conditions : ( i ) if @xmath0 and @xmath1 are processes of the same site , and @xmath0 occurs before @xmath1 , then @xmath39 .",
    "( ii ) if @xmath0 ends with an event of sending a message and @xmath1 begins with an event of receiving that message , then @xmath39 .",
    "( iii ) if @xmath39 and @xmath40 , then @xmath41 . the causality relation @xmath42 on * proc * is then defined as the smallest relation satisfying the following condition : @xmath43 if and only if @xmath39 or @xmath44 .",
    "note that the relation @xmath42 is irreflexive and symmetric , but not transitive .",
    "using the same notation as before , we informally denote by @xmath23 $ ] the time interval of a process @xmath0 . the example shown in fig .",
    "5 thus indicates that @xmath45 \\supseteq [ \\ , r\\ , ] $ ] .",
    "this containment relation is characterized by the fact that _ any process that has a causal relationship with @xmath1 has a causal relationship with @xmath37 _",
    ", i.e.      to formalize a more general setting where a process is covered by two or more processes ( fig .",
    "6 ) , we need a slight modification of the formula ( [ eq : pcc ] ) . letting @xmath47 $ ] be the time interval that at least one of @xmath48 occurs , we say that @xmath47 \\supseteq [ \\ , r\\ , ] $ ] if _ any process that has a causal relationship with any process of @xmath49 has a causal relationship with @xmath37",
    "_ , i.e.        now taking the containment relation as fundamental , we can conceive of a non - boolean model for the logic of spatiotemporal structures .",
    "letting @xmath51 be the collection of all time intervals , we stipulate that the time interval @xmath47 $ ] be the minimum element ( with respect to the set inclusion ordering ) in @xmath52 that contains the set @xmath48 .",
    "this definition of time interval indeed satisfies the condition ( [ eq : cc ] ) .",
    "the existence of the minimum element is assured by the fact that @xmath52 is closed under the set - theoretic intersection .",
    "note that @xmath52 is _ not _ closed under the set - theoretic union .",
    "as in the non - relativistic case , we obtain a logic from time structure by considering the time interval of a process as the truth value of an atomic proposition . now",
    "the resulting algebra is _ ortholattice _ , which is not boolean in general .",
    "the associated logic is called _ orthologic _ or _ minimal quantum logic _ ( for a basic reference , see birkhoff ( 1967 ) and dalla chiara ( 2001 ) , ) :    * for any proposition @xmath0 , @xmath29 denotes the proposition that the proposition @xmath0 is not true .",
    "the truth value of @xmath29 is defined as @xmath30 \\equiv \\ { q \\,\\,|\\,\\ , \\forall r\\in [ \\ , p\\ , ] .\\ ,",
    "c(q , r)\\}$ ] ( orthocomplement relative to @xmath52 ) , which + amounts to the time interval that @xmath0 is not true .",
    "the following facts follow from the definition . * * @xmath30 \\in { \\cal i}$ ] * * @xmath53 = [ \\ , p\\ , ] $ ] * * @xmath23 \\subseteq [ \\ , q\\ , ] $ ] if and only if @xmath54 \\subseteq [ \\ , \\neg p\\ , ] $ ] * for any propositions @xmath0 and @xmath1 , @xmath31 denotes the proposition that the propositions @xmath0 and @xmath1 are both true .",
    "the truth value of @xmath31 is defined as @xmath32 \\equiv [ \\ , p\\ , ] \\cap [ \\ , q\\ , ] $ ] ( set - theoretic intersection ) , which amounts to the time interval that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are both true .",
    "since @xmath52 is closed under the set - theoretic intersection , @xmath55 corresponds to the infimum operator on @xmath52 with respect to the set inclusion ordering .",
    "* for any propositions @xmath0 and @xmath1 , @xmath33 denotes the proposition that at least one of the propositions @xmath0 and @xmath1 is true .",
    "the truth value of @xmath33 is defined as @xmath34 \\equiv [ \\ , \\neg(\\neg p \\wedge \\neg q)\\ , ] $ ] , which amounts to the time interval that at least one of @xmath0 and @xmath1 is true .",
    "since @xmath56 has the above - mentioned properties and @xmath55 is the infimum operator on @xmath52 , @xmath57 corresponds to the supremum operator on @xmath52 with respect to the set inclusion ordering . note that we have @xmath58 = [",
    "\\ , p_1 \\vee p_2 \\vee \\ldots\\ , ] $ ] for atomic propositions @xmath59 .",
    "a typical statement which is always true in boolean logic but not necessarily true in orthologic is the distributive law of @xmath55 over @xmath57 , i.e. @xmath60 = [ \\ , ( p \\wedge r ) \\vee ( q \\wedge r)\\ , ] .\\ ] ] in fig .",
