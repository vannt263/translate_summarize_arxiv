    "rpcs are powerful detectors used in many hep physics experiments . their good time resolution and efficiency , in addition to their simplicity and low cost make them excellent candidates for very large area detectors .",
    "the high resistivity of glass plates helps to prevent discharge damage in these detectors , but this feature represents a weakness when it comes to their use in high rate environments .",
    "a semi - conductive glass rpc ( grpc ) is a solution to overcome this issue .",
    "the low resistivity of its doped glass accelerates the absorption of the avalanche s charge created when a charged particles crosses the rpc .",
    "a recent beam test at desy in january 2012 with a high rate electron beam constitutes a validation of this new concept .",
    "the grpc detector is based on the ionization produced by charged particles in a gas gap .",
    "a typical gas mixture is @xmath3 tfe(@xmath4 ) , @xmath5 @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xmath8 , contained in a @xmath9 gap between 2 glass plates .",
    "a high voltage between @xmath10 and @xmath11 was applied on the glass through a resistive coating , assuring the charge multiplication of initial ionizations in avalanche mode with a typical gain of @xmath12 .",
    "+    the new aspect of this detector is the low resistivity of the doped silicate glass ( less then @xmath13 , compared to the @xmath14 typical of float glass ) , provided by tsinguha university following a new process @xcite .",
    "the glass plate thickness is @xmath15 for the cathode and @xmath16 for the anode .",
    "the resistive coating is colloidal graphite of @xmath17 resistivity .",
    "the gas was uniformly distributed in the chamber using the channeling - based system .",
    "ceramic balls with @xmath9 diameter were used as spacers .",
    "the total grpc thickness was @xmath18 .",
    "the signal was collected by @xmath19 copper pads ( figure [ fig : design - c ] ) connected to a semi - digital readout system with 3 thresholds , identical to the one equipping the grpc chambers used in the sdhcal prototype developed within the calice collaboration @xcite@xcite .",
    "four @xmath20 area rpcs were built following the design shown in figure [ fig : design - a ] and were tested at desy in january 2012 . the desy ii synchrotron provides an intense and continuous electron beam with an energy up to @xmath21 .",
    "the particle rate depends on the beam energy , with a maximum of @xmath22 .",
    "the beam size is a few @xmath23 .",
    "two scintillator detectors were placed upstream of the detector . their role was to measure the beam rate .",
    "[ fig : desy ] at @xmath24 .,title=\"fig : \" ]    one additional grpc made with standard glass was added to the setup .",
    "the local efficiency and multiplicity were measured by using 3 chambers to reconstruct particle tracks and determining the expected hit position in the 4th . the multiplicity @xmath25 is defined as the number of fired pads within @xmath26 of the expected position .",
    "the efficiency @xmath27 is the fraction of tracks with @xmath28 .",
    "the efficiency ( [ fig : desy - a ] ) and multiplicity ( [ fig : desy - b ] ) were measured as function of the polarization high voltage . the same threshold was used for all voltages .",
    "the threshold value is fixed at @xmath29 and @xmath30 was chosen as the working point , giving @xmath31 .",
    "the scintillator detectors were used to determine the total particle flux , which was then divided by the beam rms area ( @xmath32 ) to obtain the rate by unit area .",
    "the measured ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) for different beam rates are plotted in figure [ fig : effrate ] .        the chamber with standard float glass ( grpc 1 ) becomes inefficient at rate exceeding one hundred @xmath35 ( above @xmath36 the efficiency is below @xmath37 ) while the semi - conductive chambers ( grpc 2 - 5 ) maintain a high efficiency @xmath38 until at least @xmath39 .",
    "semi conductive glass rpcs were tested at desy in a high rate electron beam , producing very encouraging results ; it has been shown that the main weakness of standard rpcs , namely the drop of efficiency at high rate , is clearly overcome , with efficiencies remaining at around @xmath40 at rate of @xmath39 .",
    "this feature , combined with grpc capability to provide precise time measurement , makes them an excellent candidate for future lhc muon detector upgrades .",
    "additional studies on their aging under high rate conditions are underway .",
    "a multi - gap version is also under investigation .",
