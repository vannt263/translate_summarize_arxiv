    "phase transitions play an essential role in nature .",
    "everyday transitions include the boiling of water or the melting of ice , while the transition of a metal into the superconducting state upon lowering the temperature provides a more complicated example .",
    "the universe itself is thought to have passed through several phase transitions as the high - temperature plasma formed by the big bang cooled to form the world as we know it today .",
    "phase transitions occur upon variation of an external control parameter ; their common characteristics is a qualitative change in the system properties .",
    "the phase transitions mentioned so far occur at finite temperature ; here macroscopic order ( e.g. the crystal structure in the case of melting ) is destroyed by thermal fluctuations . during recent years",
    ", a different class of phase transitions , the so - called quantum phase transitions , has attracted the attention of physicists .",
    "these transitions constitute the subject of this article .    quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) @xcite",
    "occur , in a strict sense , at exactly zero temperature only .",
    "a non - thermal control parameter , such as pressure , magnetic field , or chemical composition , is varied to access the transition point .",
    "in contrast to phase transitions at finite temperature , quantum effects play a decisive role , as the fluctuations driving the transition follow quantum instead of classical statistical mechanics .",
    "while qpts were originally considered mere curiosities of theoretical physics , the impact of this field on modern research is now emerging with increasing pace .",
    "violent quantum fluctuations caused by heisenberg s uncertainty principle are at the heart of quantum critical points ( qcps ) which control continuous qpts .",
    "they affect the finite - temperature behavior of condensed matter as well , with a multiplicity of new and unexpected phenomena .",
    "for instance , the standard model of metals with electronic interactions , the landau fermi - liquid picture , may break down in the vicinity of a qpt .",
    "in addition , since qpts occur between nearly degenerate phases whose characteristic energy scales are driven to zero , small perturbations may become important which otherwise would be masked by the primary energy scales .",
    "this has the fascinating prospect of inducing novel states of matter around qcps .",
    "to set the stage , we consider as a paradigmatic example the crystalline material tlcucl@xmath0 which displays several magnetic quantum phase transitions .",
    "tlcucl@xmath0 is a so - called mott insulator , i.e. , it is electrically insulating despite the presence of a partially filled conduction band .",
    "this insulating behavior arises from the strong coulomb repulsion which tends to localize electrons in the 3d shells of copper . as a result ,",
    "each copper atom in tlcucl@xmath0 carries one unpaired electron with a spin-1/2 magnetic moment ",
    "these moments are responsible for the variety of magnetic phenomena in tlcucl@xmath0 .    fig .",
    "[ fig : tlcucl3 ] shows magnetic phase diagrams of tlcucl@xmath0 as function of pressure or applied magnetic field and temperature .",
    "while the material is a paramagnet at ambient pressure and low field , it can be driven  at the lowest temperatures  into antiferromagnetic phases either by pressure or field .",
    "conversely , these antiferromagnetic states at @xmath1 can be destroyed either by increasing temperature  leading to a conventional thermal phase transition  or by lowering pressure or field , thereby crossing a quantum phase transition point .    .",
    "a ) pressure  temperature phase diagram at zero magnetic field .",
    "the antiferromagnetic phase breaks the su(2 ) spin symmetry of the underlying heisenberg model and is bounded by a line of finite - temperature phase transitions .",
    "this line terminates in the quantum critical point ( qcp ) , where antiferromagnetic order can be tuned by pressure at @xmath1 .",
    "( data from ref .  @xcite . )",
    "b ) field  temperature phase diagram at ambient pressure . here , the antiferromagnetic phase breaks a u(1 ) symmetry and can be interpreted as bose - einstein condensate of magnons .",
    "( data from ref.@xcite . ) ]    the underlying reason for this interesting behavior is the presence of pairs of spin-1/2 moments , dubbed dimers , which form a three - dimensional network , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : struct ] .    .",
    "it consists of planar dimers of cu@xmath2cl@xmath3 which are stacked on top of each other to form infinite double chains along the crystallographic a axis .",

    "copyright 2002 by the american physical society . ) , width=377 ]    before giving a more detailed description , we collect the basic concepts of phase transitions and critical behavior @xcite which are necessary for the later discussions .",
    "phase transitions are traditionally classified into first - order and continuous transitions . at first - order transitions the two phases co",
    "- exist at the transition point , examples include ice and water at 0@xmath4 c , or water and steam at 100@xmath4 c. in contrast , at continuous transitions , also called critical points , the two phases do not co - exist , instead they become indistinguishable at the transition point .",
    "an important example is the ferromagnetic transition of iron at 770@xmath4 c , above which the magnetic moment vanishes .",
    "this phase transition occurs at a point where thermal fluctuations destroy the regular ordering of magnetic moments  it happens continuously in the sense that the magnetization vanishes continuously when approaching the transition from below .    in the following we concentrate on systems near a continuous phase transition .",
    "such a transition can usually be characterized by an order parameter ; this is a thermodynamic quantity that is zero in one phase ( the disordered ) and non - zero and generally non - unique in the other ( the ordered ) phase .",
    "very often the choice of an order parameter for a particular transition is obvious as , e.g. , for the ferromagnetic transition where the total magnetization is an order parameter .",
    "however , in some cases finding an appropriate order parameter is complicated and still a matter of debate , e.g. , for the interaction - driven metal ",
    "insulator transition in electronic systems ( the mott transition @xcite ) .",
    "while the thermodynamic average of the order parameter is zero in the disordered phase , its fluctuations are non - zero .",
    "when the critical point is approached , the spatial correlations of the order parameter fluctuations become long - ranged .",
    "close to the critical point , their typical length scale , the correlation length @xmath5 , diverges as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the correlation length critical exponent and @xmath8 is some dimensionless measure of the distance from the critical point . if the transition occurs at a non - zero temperature @xmath9 , it can be defined as @xmath10 .",
    "in addition to the long - range correlations in space there are analogous long - range correlations of the order parameter fluctuations in time .",
    "the typical time scale for a decay of the fluctuations is the correlation ( or equilibration ) time @xmath11 . as the critical point",
    "is approached the correlation time diverges as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the dynamical critical exponent .",
    "close to the critical point , there is no characteristic length scale other than @xmath5 and no characteristic time scale other than @xmath11 .",
    "( note that a microscopic cutoff scale must be present to explain non - trivial critical behavior , for details see , e.g. , goldenfeld @xcite . in a solid such",
    "a scale is , e.g. , the lattice spacing . )",
    "the power - law singularities ( [ divxi ] ) and ( [ divtau ] ) are responsible for the so - called critical phenomena . at the phase transition point ,",
    "correlation length and time are infinite , fluctuations occur on _ all _ length and time scales , and the system is said to be scale - invariant . as a consequence ,",
    "all observables depend via power laws on the external parameters .",
    "the set of corresponding exponents  called critical exponents  completely characterizes the critical behavior near a particular phase transition .",
    "one of the most remarkable features of continuous phase transitions is universality , i.e. , the fact that the critical exponents are the same for entire classes of phase transitions which may occur in very different physical systems .",
    "these universality classes are determined only by the symmetries of the order parameter and by the space dimensionality of the system .",
    "this implies that the critical exponents of a phase transition occurring in nature can be determined exactly ( at least in principle ) by investigating _",
    "any _ simple model system belonging to the same universality class .",
    "the mechanism behind universality is again the divergence of the correlation length .",
    "close to the critical point the system effectively averages over large volumes rendering the microscopic details of the hamiltonian unimportant .",
    "the question of to what extent quantum mechanics is important for understanding a continuous phase transition has at least two aspects . on the one hand",
    ", quantum mechanics can be essential for understanding the ordered phase , ( e.g. , superconductivity )  this depends on the particular transition considered .",
    "on the other hand , one may ask whether quantum mechanics influences the asymptotic critical behavior . for this discussion",
    "we have to compare two energy scales , namely @xmath14 , which is the typical energy of order parameter fluctuations , and the thermal energy @xmath15 .",
    "we have seen in the preceeding section that the typical time scale @xmath11 of the fluctuations diverges as a continuous transition is approached .",
    "correspondingly , the typical frequency scale @xmath16 goes to zero and with it the typical energy scale @xmath17 quantum mechanics will be important as long as this typical energy scale is larger than the thermal energy @xmath15 ; on the other hand , for @xmath18 a purely classical description can be applied to the order parameter fluctuations .",
    "this implies that the character of the order parameter fluctuations crosses over from quantum to classical when @xmath14 falls below @xmath15 .",
    "now , for any transition occurring at some finite temperature @xmath9 , quantum mechanics will become unimportant for @xmath19 , in other words , the critical behavior sufficiently close to the transition is entirely classical .",
    "this justifies calling all finite - temperature phase transitions `` classical '' .",
    "quantum mechanics can still be important on microscopic scales , but classical thermal fluctuations dominate on the macroscopic scales that control the critical behavior .",
    "in contrast , if the transition occurs at zero temperature as a function of a non - thermal parameter @xmath8 , the order parameter fluctuations always obey quantum statistical mechanics .",
    "consequently , transitions at zero temperature are called `` quantum '' phase transitions .",
    "the characteristic scale @xmath20 often represents the energy gap to excitations above the quantum mechanical ground state .",
    "the interplay of classical and quantum fluctuations leads to an interesting phase diagram in the vicinity of the quantum critical point .",

    "there will be no true phase transition in any experiment carried out at finite temperature .",
    "however , the finite-@xmath21 behavior is characterized by three very different regimes , separated by crossovers . for low @xmath21 and",
    "@xmath23 thermal effects are negligible ( @xmath24 ) , and the critical singularity is cutoff by the deviation of the control parameter @xmath8 from criticality .",
    "this regime is dubbed `` quantum disordered '' and characterized by well - defined quasiparticle excitations ; for a magnetic transition in a metallic system this will be the usual fermi - liquid regime . for @xmath25 and @xmath26 , we are in the `` thermally disordered '' regime ; here the order is destroyed by thermal fluctuations of the ordered state ( yet quasiparticles are still well defined on intermediate scales ) .",
    "a completely different regime is the high - temperature regime above the qcp . in this `` quantum critical '' regime @xcite , bounded by crossover lines",
    "@xmath27 , the critical singularity is cutoff by the finite temperature .",
    "the properties are determined by the unconventional excitation spectrum of the quantum critical ground state , whose main characteristics is the _ absence _ of conventional quasiparticle - like excitations , which are replaced by a critical continuum of excitations . in the quantum critical regime , this continuum is thermally excited , resulting in unconventional power - law temperature dependencies of physical observables .",
    "universal behavior is only observable in the vicinity of the quantum critical point , i.e. , when the correlation length is much larger than microscopic length scales .",
    "quantum critical behavior is thus cut off at high temperatures when @xmath15 exceeds characteristic microscopic energy scales of the problem  in magnets this cutoff is , e.g. , set by the typical exchange energy .",

    "[ fig : qcpvic]b , the phase diagram is even richer . here",

    "discussed above , classical fluctuations will dominate in the vicinity of the finite-@xmath21 phase boundary , but this region becomes narrower with decreasing temperature , such that it might even be unobservable in a low-@xmath21 experiment .",
    "the fascinating quantum critical region is again at finite temperatures above the quantum critical point , and the thermally disordered regime is restricted to temperatures @xmath28 .",
    "it is instructive to discuss qpts in terms of behavior of the low - energy many - particle states of the quantum system upon a change of @xmath8 , starting with finite system size and then taking the thermodynamic limit .",
    "a first - order quantum phase transition corresponds to a ground - state level crossing at @xmath29 , which remains sharp in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "in contrast , a continuous quantum phase transition manifests itself in an avoided level crossing , which becomes sharper upon increasing the system size . here , a large number of low - lying excited state approach the ground state , reflecting the fact that the characteristic scale @xmath16 vanishes at @xmath29 . in the thermodynamic limit ,",
    "the avoided crossing becomes sharp , but only the second derivative of the ground state energy @xmath30 becomes singular .",
    "let us return to coupled dimer magnets , with tlcucl@xmath0 being a prime example .",
    "the copper atoms carry spin 1/2 , with mutual antiferromagnetic exchange interactions of heisenberg type .",
    "the monoclinic crystal structure contains two copper atoms per unit cell , hence the spins are naturally paired into dimers , and the structure can be understood as three - dimensional arrangement of coupled dimers .",

    "the couplings @xmath35 obey @xmath36 for simplicity we have reduced the inter - dimer couplings to a single coupling constant .    in the absence of a field ,",
    "the ground state is determined by the ratio @xmath37 . for @xmath38 ,",
    "quantum mechanical singlets are formed on each dimer , and the ground state is a quantum paramagnet .",
    "its elementary magnetic excitations are so - called triplons , i.e. dispersive spin-1 excitations with a minimum excitation energy @xmath39 . in the limit of @xmath40 the ground state is simply given by a product state of dimer singlets , and the gap @xmath41 .",
    "if , in contrast , @xmath42 , the system is a three - dimensional antiferromagnet displaying magnetic long - range order .",
    "( we are assuming that the magnetic frustration inherent in the lattice structure is small . ) thus , tuning the ratio @xmath37 will lead to a magnetic order ",

    "the spin symmetry of the hamiltonian is reduced from su(2 ) to u(1 ) , and the ordered phase breaks this u(1 ) symmetry .",
    "the lowest triplon branch of the paramagnet can be interpreted as a bosonic excitation on top of the singlet ground state . in the field - ordered phase",

    "this article has illustrated aspects of zero - temperature phase transitions in quantum systems .",
    "conceptually , quantum phase transitions open a field of fascinating physics , as they are connected to the peculiar properties of the quantum critical ground state .",
    "quantum criticality also provides new perspectives in the study of correlated systems , where intermediate - coupling phenomena are hardly accessible by standard weak- or strong - coupling perturbative approaches .",
    "a promising route starts by identifying quantum critical points between stable phases , and then uses these as vantage points for exploring the phase diagram by expanding in the deviation from criticality .",
    "while thermodynamic properties of magnetic quantum phase transitions in insulators , as in our example , are relatively well understood ( this also applies to phase transitions with other conventional order parameters ) , there is a variety of challenges in current research : ( i ) quantum phase transitions in metals , often accompanied by non - fermi liquid behavior , are less understood , due to the coupling between order parameter fluctuations and particle - hole excitations of the metal .",
    "( ii ) transitions without a local order parameter are known to exist , but they are a hard task for theory , with examples being the mott transition and various types of topological transitions .",
    "( iii ) the influence on quantum phase transitions of quenched disorder , which is unavoidable is solids , is very strong .",
    "even simple models lead to spectacular effects , but little is known for more realistic types of disorder .",
    "( iv ) transport , and more generally , non - equilibrium properties , near quantum phase transitions are an exciting and difficult venue of research . here , beautiful experiments with ultracold atomic gases have triggered a lot of interest .",
    "it is clear that we have just scratched the surface of this field , and much exciting progress is expected in the future ."
