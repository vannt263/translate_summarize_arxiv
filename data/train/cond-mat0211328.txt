    "over the past 30 years or so the coherent potential approximation  @xcite ( cpa ) has proved to be a generally reliable method for dealing with disordered systems .",
    "@xcite however , being in essence a single - site mean - field theory ,  @xcite the cpa fails to take into account the effect of non - local potential correlations due to the disorder in the environment of each site and hence leaves much important physics out of consideration .",
    "consequently , considerable effort has been spent in trying to find a way of improving it systematically by a multi - site or cluster generalization .",
    "surprisingly this has turned out to a very difficult problem  @xcite and a viable solution has been proposed only recently .",
    "the new method has emerged from the dynamical cluster approximation  @xcite ( dca ) which was directed originally at describing dynamical spin and charge fluctuations in simple hubbard models of strongly - correlated electron systems .",
    "recently its static limit has been adapted by jarrell and krishnamurthy for a simple tight - binding model of electrons moving in a disordered potential .",
    "@xcite the same problem was investigated by moradian et al .",
    "@xcite in this paper we develop the ideas behind this approximation further and demonstrate how they can be combined with realistic , ab - initio descriptions of systems of interacting electrons in disordered systems .    because the language of our multiple scattering theory is so different from that of the context in which the dca is usually deployed",
    ", we elaborate on this relationship .",
    "firstly , we note that the dca was invented to describe short - range correlations within the framework of the dynamical mean field theory  @xcite ( dmft ) of spin and charge fluctuations in many - electron systems .",
    "secondly , we recall that that the dmft can be regarded as the dynamical generalization of the cpa for the hubbard ` alloy analogy ' problem .",
    "@xcite thus , in the light of these remarks , it is natural to investigate the static version of the dca as a generalization of the cpa which includes a description of short - range order .",
    "indeed , jarrell and krishnamurthy  @xcite already studied the problem of electronic structure in random alloys from this point of view . in this paper",
    "we tackle the same problem using an identical conceptual framework but a very different description of the electrons afforded by multiple scattering theory .",
    "@xcite to make the above remarks more specific we would like to highlight two of the principal differences between our treatment of the problem and that of ref .  .",
    "firstly , we do not make use of a tight - binding model hamiltonian but solve , numerically , a schrdinger equation in each unit cell and match the ` out - going wave ' solution to the incoming waves from all the other unit cells .",
    "this is known as the multiple scattering approach  @xcite to the problem of electronic structure in solids and is the foundation of the korringa - kohn and rostoker ( kkr ) band theory method .",
    "consequently , the principal virtue of our formalism , as opposed to those based on tight - binding model hamiltonians is that it prepares the ground for first - principles calculations based on density - functional theories .",
    "@xcite the second difference is a formal consequence of the first . in multiple scattering theories",
    "the object of interest is not the self - energy and the diagrammatic language of perturbation theory is not used .",
    "we will show that the quantities that play the role of the self - energy in multiple scattering theory are the effective scattering amplitudes @xmath0 and effective structure constants @xmath1 which are also the natural concepts in effective medium theories .",
    "@xcite in short , these formal reasons fully account for the fact that we do not base our arguments on ` restoring momentum conservation ' and introducing approximate laue functions to renormalize diagrams but construct our theory in terms of real and reciprocal space clusters .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that our final algorithm described in sec .",
    "[ algorithm ] is equivalent to those investigated by jarrell and krishnamurthy .",
    "@xcite our aim in reformulating the problem is to facilitate the deployment of the method as a first - principles calculation , in other words to develop a non - local kkr - cpa .",
    "@xcite    in brief , our kkr - nlcpa method introduces new effective structure constants and this enables us to define an effective medium which includes non - local potential correlations over all length scales . using a ` coarse - graining ' procedure inspired by the dca we can then derive a self - consistent ` cluster generalization ' of the kkr - cpa  @xcite which determines an approximation to this effective medium by including non - local correlations up to the range of the cluster size .",
    "the kkr - nlcpa satisfies all of the requirements for a successful cluster generalization of the kkr - cpa as listed by gonis .",
    "@xcite in particular , the kkr - nlcpa becomes exact in the limit of large cluster sizes where it includes non - local correlations over all length scales , and recovers the kkr - cpa for a single - site cluster .",
    "the method is fully causal , allows the effects of short - range order to be modelled , and can be implemented numerically for realistic systems .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the formalism for the kkr - nlcpa .",
    "we explain our kkr - nlcpa algorithm and show how to include short - range order .",
    "we describe in more detail how to carry out the coarse - graining with reference to simple cubic , body - centered cubic and face - centered cubic lattices .",
    "finally we explain how to use the kkr - nlcpa formalism to calculate observable quantities such as the configurationally - averaged density of states in preparation for dft calculations . in order to illustrate the improvements over the conventional kkr - cpa , in sec .",
    "[ results ] we present results ( configurationally - averaged density of states ) for the application of the formalism to a one - dimensional model .",
    "however we emphasise that the formalism presented is fully tractable for realistic three - dimensional systems .",
    "for the sake of clarity , we begin by briefly summarising the idea of the conventional kkr - cpa  @xcite method .",
    "the path operator equation describing the scattering of an electron in a general array of non - overlapping potentials , centered on site positions @xmath2 , is given by @xmath3 where the underscore denotes a matrix in angular momentum space with the usual angular momentum indices @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the position vector connecting sites @xmath6 and @xmath7 . for spherically symmetric scatterers",
    "the individual t - matrices are diagonal i.e. @xmath8 but the structure constants @xmath9 are not",
    ". we shall be interested in situations where the lattice sites labeled by @xmath6 and @xmath7 form a regular array , an infinite lattice , but the single - site t - matrices vary from site to site in a random fashion .",
    "if we consider the solution of eq .",
    "( 1 ) for all possible disorder configurations and then take its average , we arrive at an averaged path operator @xmath10 which is translationally - invariant . in practice",
    "it is not computationally feasible to average over every possible disorder configuration nor is an equation which determines the averaged path operator @xmath10 readily available in the form of eq .  1 .",
    "under these circumstances a way forward is to follow the strategy of ` effective medium theories ' .",
    "@xcite in the present context a useful ` effective medium ' is that provided by an ordered array of effective scatterers described by the same t - matrix @xmath0 . in the kkr - cpa ,  @xcite the scattering amplitude describing these effective scatterers",
    "is determined using the self - consistency condition that excess scattering off a single - site impurity embedded in such a medium be zero on the average . as mentioned in the introduction , whilst very successful in many applications , being a single - site approximation the cpa fails to take into account the effect of non - local potential correlations due to the disorder in the environment of each site .",
    "the first step in going beyond the kkr - cpa is to define what we will call the non - local cpa ( nlcpa ) effective medium by the following equation : @xmath11 where a circumflex symbol denotes an nlcpa effective medium quantity .",
    "here we have defined nlcpa effective local t - matrices @xmath0 and a new _ effective propagator _ by @xmath12 this is composed of the usual free - space kkr structure constants @xmath13 which account for the lattice structure plus a _ translationally - invariant _ effective disorder term @xmath14 .",
    "the matrix @xmath15 takes into account , in an averaged manner , the non - local correlations due to the disorder configurations .    clearly",
    "a cluster generalization of the kkr - cpa would involve determining the above nlcpa effective medium by requiring excess scattering off an impurity _ cluster _ of real potentials embedded in the effective medium to be zero on the average , and indeed this is the strategy followed in the next section .",
    "however the fact that @xmath15 is a translationally - invariant effective medium quantity means that it is diagonal in @xmath16 , reciprocal space . in the present problem it is important to treat the theory in both real lattice and reciprocal lattice space consistently and crucially",
    "we shall deal with this by a coarse - graining procedure .",
    "the first step is to consider a cluster of sites in the nlcpa effective medium . denoting the sites within the cluster by capital letters",
    ", it can be shown ( see appendix a ) that eq .",
    "( 2 ) can be rewritten as a cluster equation given by @xmath17 with the effective _",
    "cluster t - matrix _ defined as @xmath18 eq .",
    "( 4 ) is simply a re - arrangement of eq .",
    "( 2 ) so that the site matrix elements of all matrices involve the cluster sites only .",
    "the cluster t - matrix @xmath19 describes the scattering within a cluster and @xmath20 takes account of all scatterings outside of the cluster via the effective _ cluster renormalised interactor _",
    "@xcite @xmath21 . nevertheless , since @xmath22 , it is clear that the cluster t - matrix also includes non - local correlations between the cluster sites .",
    "it should be stressed that @xmath21 describes all paths from the cluster site @xmath23 to the cluster site @xmath24 which only involve intermediate sites outside of the cluster .",
    "it is independent of the contents of the cluster and can be viewed as describing the effective medium from which the cluster has been removed i.e. replaced by a _",
    "cavity_. we may now define an ` impurity cluster ' embedded in the effective medium simply by filling up this cavity with a particular configuration of site potentials .",
    "clearly , the path operator for sites @xmath25 belonging to such an impurity cluster is given by @xmath26 with the impurity cluster t - matrix defined by @xmath27 for a cluster containing @xmath28 sites each scattering according to @xmath29 or @xmath30 , there are @xmath31 possible impurity cluster configurations .",
    "we are now in a position to generalize the usual cpa self - consistency condition to determine our approximation to the exact configurationally - averaged medium described by @xmath32 , namely the nlcpa effective medium described by @xmath20 .",
    "this follows by considering for each configuration the impurity cluster path operator for paths starting and ending on the impurity cluster sites and demanding that the average over all configurations be equal to the path operator for the nlcpa effective medium itself i.e. @xmath33 the important point to note is that unlike many other self - consistent cluster theories such as the molecular coherent potential approximation  @xcite ( mcpa ) and extensions , here @xmath20 and @xmath0 correspond to an effective medium which is invariant under translation from site to site and hence does not yield spurious gaps in the band structure which could affect the calculation of transport properties etc .",
    "@xcite this is a consequence of our definition of the non - local correlation terms @xmath34 as translationally - invariant . to preserve this periodicity ,",
    "during each self - consistency cycle we must have @xmath35 this can be seen by applying the usual lattice fourier transform to eq .",
    "( 2 ) and then considering the cluster sites @xmath25 . clearly , to carry out the above integration numerically we must have a specific representation of the function @xmath36 .",
    "following the central idea of the dca , we proceed by coarse - graining @xmath36 over the brillouin zone . unlike many other attempts ,",
    "@xcite this approach has been shown to be fully causal .",
    "due to the finite size @xmath28 of the cluster in real - space , the differences in distance between the cluster sites correspond to a set of @xmath28 cluster momenta @xmath37 in reciprocal space according to the relation @xmath38 these @xmath37 are at the centers of a set of @xmath28 reciprocal - space patches which coarse - grain the first brillouin zone of the lattice .",
    "earlier it was noted that the effective cluster t - matrix also includes non - local correlation terms @xmath39 acting between the cluster sites .",
    "we use the above relation to coarse - grain @xmath36 as follows : @xmath40 @xmath41 since the nlcpa maps the effective lattice problem to that of a self - consistently embedded impurity cluster problem , the fundamental assumption we make is that provided we are aiming to reproduce these correlations of finite range in the effective lattice , we may take the above coarse - grained values @xmath42 to be a good approximation to @xmath36 for the effective lattice . in short ,",
    "@xmath43 if @xmath44 is in the @xmath45 reciprocal - space patch .",
    "this is discussed more formally in appendix b.    the next step is to define the ` coarse - grained averaged ' reciprocal - space matrix elements for the effective medium path operator by @xmath46 where each integral is over the reciprocal - space patch @xmath47 of volume @xmath48 surrounding the point @xmath49 .",
    "this is straightforward since each @xmath42 is constant within its coarse - graining patch . defining transformations relating the real - space and coarse - grained reciprocal - space matrix elements by @xmath50 @xmath51 means that the real - space effective medium path operator for sites @xmath25 within the cluster is now given by    @xmath52    which we use to replace eq .",
    "( 9 ) , and we can now iterate to self - consistency until eq .  ( 8) and eq .  (",
    "16 ) are satisfied .",
    "finally , note that the nlcpa reduces to the cpa for @xmath53 . in this limit the non - local correlation terms @xmath39 vanish and the nlcpa effective t - matrix becomes equal to the usual cpa effective t - matrix . the nlcpa becomes exact as @xmath54 where @xmath55 and non - local correlations over all length scales are treated . for clarity the full kkr - nlcpa algorithm is now summarised below .",
    "all real - space matrices in the algorithm are super - matrices ( denoted by double underscores ) in cluster - site and angular momentum space . for a particular energy @xmath56 ,    1 .",
    "make a guess for the effective cluster t - matrix @xmath19 for the first iteration .",
    "do this by placing an average t - matrix ( ata ) , @xmath57 ( where p(a ) is the probability of a site being occupied by an @xmath58 atom ) , on each cluster site , and for the site to site propagation terms in the cluster use the free - space structure constants i.e. set @xmath59 .",
    "2 .   calculate @xmath60 using eq .",
    "( 5 ) i.e. @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the diagonal part of @xmath63 . for the first iteration @xmath60 will of course be zero .",
    "convert the matrix elements @xmath60 to coarse - grained reciprocal space using eq .",
    "4 .   calculate the coarse - grained matrix elements @xmath64 using eq .",
    "( 13 ) and convert them to real space using eq .",

    "calculate the new cluster t - matrix @xmath19 by solving eq .",
    "( 4 ) using @xmath67 above and @xmath21 from step 5 i.e. @xmath68 8 .   compare the new cluster t - matrix elements @xmath19 with those in step 1 .",
    "if they are not equal to within the desired accuracy , repeat as necessary steps 2 @xmath69 8 using the new cluster t - matrix until convergence within the desired accuracy is achieved .",
    "note that the integrations over the reciprocal space patches in step 4 only involve the inversion of a matrix in angular momentum space and therefore computational time is not significantly increased over the conventional kkr - cpa regardless of cluster size .",
    "this is in contrast to many other attempts such as the mcpa where the integration over the brillouin zone requires the inversion of a super - matrix in cluster - site and angular momentum space for each value of @xmath44 .",
    "we also draw attention to the recent work of maier and jarrell  @xcite where the dca algorithm has been shown to converge more quickly than the mcpa algorithm , with corrections of order @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the linear size of the cluster .",
    "since the nlcpa maps the impurity cluster problem to the effective lattice problem in reciprocal space , it is important to realize that the real - space cluster must have periodic boundary conditions i.e. must preserve the translational symmetry of the lattice .",
    "moreover , as explained in ref .  , in order to obtain suitable reciprocal space patches centered at the cluster momenta @xmath37 , we must select the real - space cluster sites by surrounding them with a ` tile ' of size @xmath72 ( where @xmath73 is the dimension ) which preserves the full point - group symmetry of the lattice and only clusters which satisfy this requirement are allowed .    the method for finding the corresponding cluster momenta @xmath37 satisfying eq .",
    "( 10 ) for a simple two - dimensional square lattice has been described in ref .  .",
    "here we generalize this method to the case of three - dimensional simple cubic ( sc ) , body - centered cubic ( bcc ) , and face - centered cubic ( fcc ) lattices commonly found in real disordered alloys .",
    "for the trivial case of @xmath53 , the real - space ` tiles ' with the required symmetry would simply be wigner - seitz cells surrounding each lattice point . for larger cluster sizes",
    "we may take the ` tiles ' to be simple cubes of volume @xmath74 for each of these lattices .",
    "the smallest possible cluster sizes are given by considering @xmath75 ( where @xmath76 is the lattice constant ) and this yields @xmath53 for sc ( trivial ) , @xmath77 for bcc , and @xmath78 for fcc lattices .",
    "the next set of allowed cluster sizes is given by considering @xmath79 and this yields @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 for sc , bcc and fcc lattices respectively .",
    "the next step is to consider the ` principal tiling vectors ' @xmath83 where @xmath84 for integers @xmath85 map out the centers of the real - space ` tiles ' . applying the usual reciprocal space transformations of the form @xmath86 etc .",
    "gives us principal ` coarse - grained ' reciprocal space vectors @xmath87 .",
    "we take @xmath28 non - equivalent vectors ( i.e. do not differ by a reciprocal lattice vector ) of the form @xmath88 for integers @xmath85 to be our set of cluster momenta @xmath37 and these will satisfy eq .  (",
    "the reciprocal space patches surrounding these cluster momenta will be simple cubes of equal volume @xmath89 which together will fill out a volume the size of the first brillouin zone i.e. @xmath90 for sc , @xmath91 for bcc , and @xmath92 for fcc lattices respectively .",
    "integrating over these patches is equivalent to integrating over the first brillouin zone of the lattice since @xmath49 values and parts of patches lying outside of the first brillouin zone can be translated through reciprocal lattice vectors ( of the sc , bcc , or fcc lattice as appropriate ) to lie within the first brillouin zone . in tab .",
    "[ table ] we give some examples of sets of @xmath93 and corresponding @xmath49 values obtained using the above method .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the principal advantage of the kkr - nlcpa over the conventional kkr - cpa is that it can be implemented for alloys in which short - range ordering or clustering is present . to deal with this situation",
    "one must include an appropriate weighting for each of the @xmath31 impurity cluster configurations in step 6 of the algorithm .",
    "note that such short - range order will not destroy the translational invariance because it will be restored by the configurational averaging .",
    "however when using some method to weight the configurations it is important to bear in mind the periodic boundary conditions imposed on the cluster as explained in the previous section . to illustrate the above feature of the theory we will describe short - range order with a one - dimensional example later in this paper .      in order to calculate observables such as the configurationally - averaged densities and density of states , we need to know the configurationally - averaged green s function calculated within the nlcpa .",
    "the expression for the green s function before averaging is given by @xmath94 where @xmath95 is an angular momentum index and @xmath96 lies within the unit cell centered at site @xmath97 .",
    "@xmath98 and @xmath99 are the regular and irregular solutions  @xcite respectively of the single - site problem at site @xmath6 . in the next section",
    "we show calculations for the configurationally - averaged density of states for a one - dimensional model and so here we demonstrate explicitly how to take the configurational average of the site - diagonal greens function .",
    "it should be stressed that unlike in calculations based on tight - binding models , in the present multiple scattering theory we solve for and describe the site to site fluctuations of the ` orbitals ' @xmath98 . in short",
    "we can calculate the density @xmath100 point by @xmath100 point .",

    "@xcite in principle a dft calculation of a disordered system should mean that separate scf calculations are carried out to minimise the total energy for each disorder configuration individually and then an average taken over all disorder configurations .",
    "this is , of course , intractable and the strategy behind scf - kkr - cpa calculations has been to minimise a functional for the averaged energy in terms of partially averaged charge ( and spin ) densities , i.e. the average of charge densities arising from all configurations which have either an a or a b atom on one site . from this approach , however , it is not straightforward to include local environment effects such as electrostatic , ` charge - correlation '  @xcite madelung and local lattice displacement effects in alloys or indeed short - range order effects in general . for disordered alloys ,",
    "the implementation requires the solution of the kohn - sham equations for electrons moving in the disordered arrays of the effective potentials associated with a and b sites which are insensitive to their environments . in the context of finite temperature magnetism",
    "it means that the thermally induced spin fluctuations must be characterised as ` local moments ' associated with single sites and not larger clusters . in this paper",
    "we have taken the first steps in showing how these serious omissions can be rectified by presenting a scheme within the kkr framework which goes systematically beyond the cpa .",
    "consider a finite - sized cluster @xmath144 of sites in the effective medium .",
    "( 2 ) for sites @xmath145 belonging to the cluster can be written in the form @xmath146 where the sum over all sites @xmath147 has been split into those involving sites @xmath147 within the cluster and sites @xmath147 outside of the cluster .",
    "it can be shown  @xcite that @xmath148 with the effective cluster renormalised interactor @xmath149 given by the locator expansion @xmath150 inserting ( a2 ) into ( a1 ) and using the notation that cluster sites are denoted by capital letters gives @xmath151 which can be re - arranged as @xmath152 to include the effective cluster t - matrix given by eq .",
    "( 5 ) .",
    "firstly we note that the correlations between the cluster sites which we are aiming to reproduce in the effective lattice are of a finite range , say @xmath153 , where @xmath71 is the linear size of the ` tile ' surrounding the cluster sites ( see sec .",
    "[ kpoints ] ) .",
    "the next step is to divide or ` coarse - grain ' the first brillouin zone of the lattice of @xmath154 sites into @xmath155 patches of size @xmath156 ( where @xmath73 is the dimension ) centered at the cluster momenta @xmath37 .",
    "we now consider each coarse - grained value @xmath42 to be the average of @xmath36 over the @xmath157 lattice momenta @xmath158 within the patch surrounding the point @xmath49 : @xmath159    the fundamental assumption we make is to take these coarse - grained values @xmath42 to be a good approximation to @xmath36 for the effective lattice .",
    "@xcite this is because according to nyquist s sampling theorem  @xcite in order to reproduce correlations of a finite range @xmath160 in real space , we only need to sample the first brillouin zone of the lattice at intervals of @xmath161 i.e. at the cluster momenta @xmath37 .",
    "the real space correlation terms @xmath162 are cut off if the distance between @xmath6 and @xmath7 is outside the range of the cluster size . as @xmath54 correlations over all length scales are treated since the maximum correlation length is proportional to the cluster size @xmath28 ."
