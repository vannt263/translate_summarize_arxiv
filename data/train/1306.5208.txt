    "rapidity fluctuations is rather weak , especially compared to the centrality dependence .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that for high energies the rapidity distribution is well described in the ultra - relativistic limit , and the difference between lhc energy and sps energies is due to doubling of the nucleon - nucleon cross section which still does not lead to a significant change in rapidity fluctuations .",
    "longitudinal fluctuations arising from initial state fluctuations in the paciae parton and hadron molecular dynamics model were analyzed recently @xcite , and the fluctuation of the center - of - mass rapidity of the system was conservatively estimated to be @xmath83 , by neglecting all pre - equilibrium emission effects that increase the @xmath0-fluctuations .",

    "the difference , which is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbpb158urqmd ] can be attributed to neglecting the initial many - nucleon correlations as well as the spectator number correlations for nucleons from the colliding nuclei , which were assumed in our model .",

    "the pre - equilibrium emission of one or two nucleons plays a non - negligible role .",

    "[ fig : angmom ] ) and one order of magnitude larger than for au+au reactions rhic energy of @xmath92 gev @xcite .",
    "the angular momentum is the largest for nuclei with a woods - saxon radial density profile , see eq .",

    "if , in addition , a transparency in the overlap region is assumed due to the finite nn cross section ( soft sphere nuclei ) then the angular momentum is further reduced by 2% and 15% at lhc and sps energies , respectively ( see fig .  [",
