    "pairing symmetry of the fe - based pnictide and chalcogenide superconductors is currently a hot topic in the study of superconductivity .",

    "et al._,@xcite a nodal and two - fold symmetry gap is revealed in an iron selenide ( fese ) superconductor .",
    "it is no doubt that a central issue towards understanding the iron - based superconductors ( fescs ) is to unambiguously identify the pairing symmetry of these materials .    among many different probes , inelastic neutron scattering ( ins )",
    "measures the two - particle excitations and can give direct information on the momentum and energy dependence of the quasiparticle excitation and the pairing gap .",
    "a strong coherence peak can emerge in the dynamic spin susceptibility if the corresponding two - particle excitation is highly degenerate ( i.e. , in good nesting condition ) .",
    "in addition , strong peaks in ins can occur due to the resonant nature .",
    "a conclusive ins measurement of fescs remains unsettled however to which wave vectors of the strong peaks are observed to be remarkably material dependent .",
    "some ins measurements have reported that spin resonances occur at the wave vector near @xmath6 [ or @xmath7 in the folded ( or unfolded ) brillouin zone ( bz ) in 1111,@xcite 122,@xcite 111,@xcite and 11 families.@xcite other ins measurements on the new 122 * family @xmath8 ( a@xmath9k , rb , and cs)@xcite of electron fermi surfaces only@xcite have revealed that a resonance peak occurs at the wave vector @xmath10 in the unfolded bz.@xcite on the theoretical side , on the other hand , prediction of the positions of the resonance peak in momentum space remains controversial .",

    "as far as two - particle excitation is concerned they are qualitatively similar .",
    "thus for a comparison point of view , it is also useful to theoretically study the charge dynamics within the same framework .",

    "@xcite the situations is still too early to make a conclusion however .",
    "some pcars measurements showed two coherent peaks and indicated that sc pairing state might be fully gaped on the fermi surface ( fs).@xcite others showed a zero - bias conductance peak ( zbcp ) and implied the presence of zero - energy bound states or andreev bound state ( abs ) on the interface .",
