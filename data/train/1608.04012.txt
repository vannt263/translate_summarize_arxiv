    "this paper continues a discussion @xcite of the floer - theoretic structures associated to lefschetz fibrations .",
    "the specific part under consideration is a linear differential equation introduced in @xcite , for a pair of functions @xmath0 of a formal parameter @xmath1 : @xmath2 the geometric context is that we are looking at a lefschetz fibration over @xmath3 , for which the fibre represents the first chern class of the total space ( this is the case for a rational elliptic surface ; or more generally , for the fibrations obtained by blowing up the base locus of an anticanonical lefschetz pencil ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 in ( each a function of @xmath1 ) are extracted from the genus zero gromov - witten invariants of the total space .",
    "in fact , a restriction on those gromov - witten invariants must be imposed : that s assumption [ th : psi - eta ] below , which was already extensively discussed in @xcite .",
    "let s look at on an elementary level , as a formal differential equation . in our context @xmath7",
    ", so we can eliminate @xmath8 , which leaves the following second order equation for @xmath9 : @xmath10 for the logarithmic derivative @xmath11 , we get a nonlinear first order equation ( a riccati equation @xcite ) @xmath12 alternatively , let s consider the action of on the projective line , which concretely means on the quotient @xmath13 .",
    "this satisfies an equation closely related to , @xmath14 in the application to lefschetz fibrations , has a straightforward meaning : it describes the @xmath1-dependence of the eigenvalues of quantum multiplication with the fibre class ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3 ) . on a deeper level , which is where the main motivation lies , it has been conjectured that governs the @xmath1-dependence of canonical natural transformations on the fukaya category of the lefschetz pencil ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4b ) .",
    "that idea was supported by a form of the homological mirror symmetry conjecture , and by example computations , but lacked a direct geometric interpretation .",
    "our task is to show that versions of  arise in symplectic cohomology .",
    "more precisely , we remove a fibre from the lefschetz fibration , so as to obtain an open symplectic manifold , whose symplectic cohomology we study . to obtain the differential equations above ,",
    "one replaces the functions in them by distinguished symplectic cohomology classes , and @xmath15 by certain connections ( operators of differentiation in @xmath1-direction ) acting on symplectic cohomology .",
    "the relation between gromov - witten invariants and symplectic cohomology has already been the object of considerable study @xcite ( one can also consider symplectic field theory as an intermediate theory , and then the relevant literature becomes much larger ) .",
    "what s new here is the appearance of connections , and their interplay both with gromov - witten invariants and with the operations on symplectic cohomology .",
    "there are at least two perspectives on the theory developed here .",
    "one can focus on the abstract framework surrounding the construction and properties of connections .",
    "this leads away from the specific geometric situation , towards more abstract and axiomatic ( tqft ) considerations .",
    "alternatively , one can emphasize the concrete computational aspects , in relation with gromov - witten theory .",
    "we will try to accomodate both tastes .",
    "the first part of the paper , consisting of sections [ sec : results][sec : motivation ] , presents an overview of the constructions and results , including their motivation .",
    "after that , in sections [ sec : conf][sec : bv ] , we operate in a greatly simplified tqft - style framework , and explain what can be seen at that level of abstraction .",
    "in contrast , sections [ sec : floer][sec : operations - on - floer - cohomology ] are much more geometric , and set up just enough floer - theoretic machinery to enable us to carry out the main computations . in section",
    "[ sec : symplectic - cohomology ] , we translate the outcome of those computations to symplectic cohomology , and this fairly straightforward process completes our argument .    _ acknowledgments .",

    "technical details will be kept to a minimum .",
    "symplectic cohomology @xcite is an invariant @xmath16 of a ( certain class of ) non - compact symplectic manifolds @xmath17 .",
    "our version of symplectic cohomology will be linear over a specific ( algebraically closed characteristic @xmath18 ) field @xmath19 , the single - variable novikov field with complex coefficients . to spell this out ,",
    "elements @xmath20 are formal series @xmath21 note that @xmath19 is closed under differentation @xmath15 .",
    "we ll assume throughout that @xmath22 .",
    "this allows us to lift the usual @xmath23-grading of symplectic cohomology to a @xmath24-grading , and it also simplifies the technical aspects of the construction .",
    "( readers who wish for more specifics about the class of symplectic manifolds under consideration are referred to section [ subsec : define - sh ] , but should keep in mind that the same ideas apply to other situations as well . )",
    "symplectic cohomology has the structure of a bv ( batalin - vilkovisky ) algebra , which one can think of as a gerstenhaber algebra structure ( consisting of a product , denoted here by @xmath25 , and an degree @xmath26 lie bracket ) together with a bv operator @xmath27 ( see e.g.  @xcite )",
    ". it also comes with a map @xmath28 we like to think of @xmath29 as a version of the construction from @xcite , hence call it a pss map .",
    "it is a map of bv algebras , if one equips @xmath30 with the small quantum product , as well as the zero bracket and bv operator .",

    "eventually , we will impose a vanishing condition , but one which is weaker and not expressed in terms of classical topology :    [ th : as-1 ] the kodaira - spencer class vanishes .",
    "whenever assumption [ th : as-1 ] holds , we want to fix a choice of bounding cochain , in the following sense .",
    "consider the chain complex underlying symplectic cohomology .",
    "pseudo - holomorphic curve theory yields a cocycle in that complex which represents @xmath34 . by assumption , this is nullhomologous , and the desired choice is that of a cochain which bounds it .",
    "two such choices have the same effect if they differ by a nullhomologous cocycle , so the essential amount of freedom is an affine space over @xmath40 .",
    "a choice of bounding cochain determines a class @xmath41 which maps to @xmath33 $ ] under the connecting homomorphism from ; and that gives rise to a class @xmath42 if one changes the bounding cochain by adding @xmath43 , the corresponding change in is @xmath44    [ th:1 ] suppose that assumption [ th : as-1 ] holds .",
    "then , a choice of bounding cochain determines a connection @xmath45 on symplectic cohomology , which is compatible with the gerstenhaber algebra structure .    here , by a connection ,",
    "we mean an operator of differentiation in @xmath15-direction : an additive ( and grading - preserving ) endomorphism @xmath45 which satisfies @xmath46 of course , any @xmath19-vector space can be equipped with a connection , simply by differentiating the coefficients with respect to some choice of basis .",
    "what makes proposition [ th:1 ] nontrivial is compatibility with the gerstenhaber algebra structure , which means that @xmath45 acts as a derivation for both the product and lie bracket : @xmath47 = [ \\nabla x_2,x_1 ] + [ x_2,\\nabla x_1].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that implies @xmath48 our connection depends on the choice of bounding cochain .",
    "changing that cochain by @xmath49 affects it as follows : @xmath50.\\ ] ] consider the interaction of the connection and the bv operator , as measured by the @xmath19-linear endomorphism @xmath51 . from the general relation between the bv operator , the product , and the bracket",
    ", it follows that @xmath51 is a ( degree @xmath26 ) derivation for the product .",
    "the following result sharpens that statement , by saying that this derivation is inner :    [ th : a - element ] the connection from proposition [ th:1 ] satisfies @xmath52.\\ ] ]    one can think of @xmath45 as part of a family of connections , @xmath53 in particular , from one gets @xmath54 it follows from that one of those connections , @xmath55 , is compatible with the bv operator ( but not with the product or bracket , in general ) : @xmath56 - a \\bullet \\delta x + \\delta(a \\bullet x ) = ( \\delta a ) \\bullet x = 0 . \\ ] ]    from one can derive corresponding formulae for @xmath57 . a particularly interesting case is @xmath58 , where one gets @xmath59 - ( a + \\delta \\alpha ) \\bullet x = \\nabla^{-1}x - \\delta(\\alpha \\bullet x ) - \\alpha \\bullet \\delta x.\\ ] ] combining and yields the following : if one considers @xmath27 as a differential on @xmath16 , then @xmath55 induces a connection on its cohomology , and that induced connection is independent of the choice of bounding cochain .",
    "this foreshadows the relation with a different structure , namely the gauss - manin connection on equivariant symplectic cohomology , which will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "take a proper symplectic lefschetz fibration @xmath60 and choose a smooth fibre @xmath61 .",

    "we call @xmath80 the borman - sheridan class .    from the perspective of @xcite",
    ", the borman - sheridan class can be viewed as a special case of a more general idea .",
    "suppose that we start with a lefschetz fibration @xmath81 which does not necessarily extend over @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath82 be the monodromy around @xmath83 , which is a symplectic automorphism of the fibre .",
    "its fixed point floer cohomology @xmath84 comes with a map ( which already played a role in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* conjecture 6.1 ) ) @xmath85 obtained by counting sections of with suitable asymptotic conditions .",
    "it turns out that the composition of this map and is always zero ( this is a generalization of lemma [ th : z1-vanish ] ) .",
    "now consider the double composition @xmath86 this is zero for two different reasons : the one which we have just mentioned , and also because @xmath27 vanishes on the image of the pss map . by subtracting the two underlying nullhomotopies from each other ,",
    "one gets a map @xmath87 in the specific situation arising from , @xmath82 is essentially the identity map ; more precisely , because of our assumption on @xmath88 , one has @xmath89 .",
    "one plugs @xmath90 into to obtain .",
    "so far , our observations have not depended on making any assumptions on the enumerative geometry of @xmath91 .",
    "we will now introduce the key restriction :    [ th : psi - eta ] there are @xmath92 ( the first of which is necessarily nonzero ) such that @xmath93 = \\psi z^{(1 ) } - \\eta [ m ] \\in h^2({f};{{\\mathbb k}}).\\ ] ]    even though we have in principle allowed @xmath94 $ ] to be a real cohomology class , the condition implies that it ca nt be too irrational : by looking at the lowest nontrivial coefficient of @xmath4 , one sees that there are @xmath95 such that @xmath96 + \\beta[m]$ ] is rational .",
    "somewhat more importantly , in order for to hold , @xmath97 must be nonzero , which implies that the lefschetz fibration must have pseudo - holomorphic sections ( for any choice of compatible almost complex structure which makes the map pseudo - holomorphic ) .",
    "as we will now explain , there is a natural source of examples where that is the case .",

    "if we assume additionally that @xmath102 then one can write @xmath103 + \\text{(some element of $ { { \\mathbb k}}$)$\\,[m]$ } \\\\ & = ( q^{\\gamma } + \\text{higher powers of $ q$})\\ , q^{-1}[\\omega_f ] + \\text{(some element of $ { { \\mathbb k}}$)$\\,[m]$}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] assumption [ th : psi - eta ] will therefore be satisfied .",
    "one example is the algebro - geometric pencil of calabi - yau hypersurfaces on @xmath104 , @xmath105 .",
    "there is also a useful generalization , in which one replaces @xmath106 with the subspace which is invariant under a suitable automorphism group ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 3.3 ) . that generalization applies e.g.  to the pencil of elliptic curves on @xmath107 ( giving rise to a space @xmath91 which is a rational elliptic surface ) .    as explained in @xcite , allowing formal bulk deformations of the symplectic form greatly extends the reach of assumption [ th : psi - eta ] , for appropriately twisted versions of all the floer - theoretic structures .",
    "it would be possible to allow such deformations throughout the current paper as well , but we wo nt do that , in the interest of simplicity .",
    "returning to the main thread of our argument , we notice that , by lemma [ th : z1-vanish ] , assumption [ th : psi - eta ] implies assumption [ th : as-1 ] .",
    "one can be a little more precise :    [ th : bounding ] suppose that assumption [ th : psi - eta ] holds .",
    "then , for a suitable choice of bounding cochain , the class is given by @xmath108    on a conceptual level , this is not surprising : the definitions of the two sides of are parallel , and the condition @xmath33",

    ", one can equivalently rewrite as @xmath109 we can go further , and describe how the connection acts on @xmath80 :    [ th : sigma1 ] suppose that assumption [ th : psi - eta ] holds .",
    "then , one can choose the bounding cochain so that lemma [ th : bounding ] is satisfied , and with the additional property that @xmath110    this is a counterpart of , with @xmath80 instead of @xmath111 , and @xmath45 instead of ordinary differentiation .",
    "we will now draw some immediate consequences from it .",
    "an equivalent statement is that @xmath112 satisfies the analogue of : @xmath113 in terms of @xmath57 , takes on the following form : @xmath114 in particular , setting @xmath115 causes the nonlinear term to vanish , @xmath116 this equation and the @xmath115 case of are counterparts of the components of , with @xmath117 replacing ordinary differentiation . imitating the argument there , one can eliminate @xmath80 by substitution , and obtain the analogue of for @xmath118 alone : @xmath119 we have now fulfilled the promise , made at the beginning of the paper , that all forms  of the basic differential equation would occur in the context of symplectic cohomology .",
    "this section is not strictly speaking needed for the rest of the paper .",

    "the classical case corresponds to taking @xmath125 to be the diagonal bimodule @xmath120 .",
    "one can also use the linear dual @xmath126 , in which case @xmath127 for us , another choice will be of special interest , namely when @xmath125 is the inverse dualizing bimodule @xmath128 ( * ? ? ? * definition 8.1.6 ) .",
    "a little confusingly , its cohomology is already itself a hochschild cohomology group , @xmath129 @xmath128 itself can be defined by equipping the standard cochain complex underlying with an @xmath121-bimodule structure .",

    "<S> floer cohomology groups are usually defined over a field of formal functions ( a novikov field ) . under certain assumptions , one can equip them with connections , which means operations of differentiation with respect to the novikov variable . </S>",
    "<S> this allows one to write differential equations for floer cohomology classes . here </S>",
    "<S> , we apply that idea to symplectic cohomology groups associated to lefschetz fibrations , and obtain a relation with enumerative geometry . </S>"
