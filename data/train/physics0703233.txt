    "the transport of excitons - and hence energy - through molecular materials is determined by the exciton transfer integral between neighboring conjugated chromophores",
    ". typically , the length of these chromophores are larger than the distances between them , and thus the usual expression for the transfer integrals , derived by invoking the dipole approximation , is invalid .",
    "indeed , the use of the dipole approximation implies that the exciton transfer integral between equivalent neighboring chromophores scales linearly as the chromophore length .",
    "this prediction contradicts the computations of the transfer integrals using various computational techniques , which predict that the transfer integrals vanish in the asymptotic limit@xcite - a result in agreement with the decreasing davydov splitting as a function of chromophore length observed in self - assembled molecular aggregates@xcite .",
    "the exciton transfer integral , @xmath6 , between two polymer chains ( or linear conjugated chromophores ) @xmath7 and @xmath8 is defined by@xcite , @xmath9      \\left[{_n}\\langle \\textrm{ex } |\\hat{n}_j|\\textrm{gs}\\rangle_n      \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the ground and excited states of polymer @xmath7 .",

    "the exact computation of exciton transfer integrals using transition densities is computationally expensive .",
    "a convenient approximation is the so - called line - dipole approximation@xcite , which provides a physically intuitive , yet accurate description for exciton transfer when the chromophore separation is large enough ( typically , three or four times the monomer length ) .    in this paper",
    "we use the exciton model to explicitly derive the line - dipole approximation .",
    "next , using the line - dipole approximation , analytical expressions for the exciton transfer integral between parallel and collinear conjugated polymers are derived , and the scaling with polymer length is determined .",
    "we conclude by discussing the implications of these results for exciton transfer via the frster mechanism .    before deriving the line - dipole approximation , however , we review the point - dipole approximation for the evaluation of @xmath6 .",

    "it is these interference effects that mean ultimately the exciton transfer integral must vanish in the asymptotic limit for chain separations greater than a few monomer lengths .",
    "a second way to motivate this scaling behavior is to consider the sign of @xmath0 as two finite - length dipoles are moved longitudinally relative to another .",

    "the standing wave approximation is more relevant than the plane wave approximation in linear conjugated polymers or chromophores , although the plane wave approximation enables analytical results to be derived . in reality , however , disorder or self - trapping will modify the exciton center - of - mass wavefunction from both of these idealized functional forms , and under these circumstances it is necessary to evaluate eq .",
