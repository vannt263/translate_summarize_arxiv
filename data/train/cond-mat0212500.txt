    "statistics of a set of one - dimensional random walks _ conditioned never to collide _ in a given time interval , say @xmath2 , has its own importance in statistical physics , since , if we set @xmath4 , it realizes the one - dimensional fermi statistics @xcite , and with @xmath5 it is used to analyze the models for wetting and melting phenomena @xcite .",
    "we will refer to such non - colliding random walks and the continuum counterpart , non - colliding brownian motions , simply as _ vicious walks _ following the terminology used by m. fisher @xcite . for",
    "the pioneering work on vicious walker models , see @xcite .",
    "a generic setting of vicious walk problems is discussed in @xcite .",
    "recently the interest on the vicious walks in mathematical physics is renewed and growing very rapidly , for close relationships of the vicious walk problem with the study of ensembles of young tableaux and the symmetric functions @xcite , the theories of orthogonal polynomials and random matrices @xcite , and some topics of representation theory and probability theory @xcite have been clarified .    in an earlier paper @xcite ,",
    "the continuum limit of non - colliding random walks on a lattice was taken by letting the temporal and spatial units @xmath6 go to zero with the relation @xmath7 and a system of non - colliding brownian motions was derived . since each random walk tends to be a brownian motion in this _",
    "diffusion scaling limit _ , such a construction of non - colliding brownian motion is plausible , and indeed mathematical rigor can be established as a functional central limit theorem of vicious walks @xcite .",
    "the important fact is that the repulsive interaction among the obtained brownian particles is no longer contact interaction as in the original vicious random walks on a lattice but is long ranged .",
    "the origin of this long - ranged interaction is the restriction of allowed configurations by the non - colliding condition , so that we can say it is an example of entropy - origin effective force .",
    "moreover , the following setting was considered in our vicious walks ; ( i ) even after taking the continuum limit , still we let the time interval , in which the non - colliding condition is imposed , be finite @xmath5 , and ( ii ) all the brownian particles are assumed to start from an origin and the time interval of non - colliding is @xmath0 $ ] .    in this",
    "setting the process is temporally inhomogeneous . at the very early stage @xmath8 the repulsive interaction",
    "should be strong , since the brownian motions will be restricted so that they will not collide for a long time period up to time @xmath2 in the future . as the time @xmath1 going on , the strength of repulsion is decreasing as is the remaining time until @xmath2 , and attains its minimum at the final time @xmath9 ,",
    "at which there is no more restriction of motion in the future @xmath10 .",
    "it was dyson s idea that such systems of brownian motions with long - ranged repulsion could have the equilibrium states , which can be described by the distribution functions of eigenvalues of random matrices in the ensembles appropriately specified by symmetry of the system @xcite .",
    "the previous paper @xcite showed that the spatial distribution of vicious walkers at @xmath8 realizes the eigenvalue - statistics of the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) , one at @xmath9 does that of the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) , and the gue to goe transition is observed in the intermediate time , which is equivalent with the transition studied in the two - matrix model by pandey and mehta @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we will characterize this transition in distribution by calculating the moments of the positions of @xmath11 particles as functions of time @xmath1 , @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the position of @xmath14-th vicious walker and @xmath15 the average at time @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "in addition to such an interest of statistical physics , we can put emphasis that our present study possesses another importance as an interesting application of the graphical expansion theory . in high energy physics , graphical expansions for the matrix models of su(@xmath11 )",
    "gauge theory were studied using _ ribbon graphs _ representing propagators and it was shown that the dominant graphs for large @xmath11 are the planar ones and the leading corrections come from the graphs embedded in a torus , which are depressed by a factor @xmath17 with respect to the planar graphs @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it was clarified that in the graphical expansion of so(@xmath11 ) gauge theory the leading corrections only are depressed by a factor @xmath18 for large @xmath11 with respect to the dominant planar graphs , in which propagators can be represented by _ twisted ribbons _ @xcite . in the gauge theory ,",
    "the presence of non - gaussian interaction terms of cubic or higher power is crucial and it leads to _ triangulations of random surfaces_. although the gaussian matrix models associated with the present vicious walker model are not related with the triangulation problem of random surfaces and only give purely enumerative problems of surfaces , the proper structures of large @xmath11 expansions in su(@xmath11 ) and so(@xmath11 ) gauge theories are also found in the gue and goe models , respectively .",
    "we can show that , if @xmath4 in our vicious walker model , the moments of the walker positions ( [ eqn : moment0 ] ) can be calculated by the graphical expansion method of gue using the ribbon graphs and the results are given in the form of power series in the inverse of the _ square _ of matrix size @xmath11 , @xmath19 here the coefficients @xmath20 are the numbers of _ orientable surfaces of genus _",
    "@xmath21 made from @xmath22-gon by some specified procedure @xcite ( see also @xcite and sec.5.5 in @xcite ) . on the other hand , for the goe we have to take into account the _ non - orientable surfaces _ as well as the orientable ones and the expansion is in the form of power series in @xmath18 .",
    "in other words , in order to generate necessary surfaces , we need to use twisted ribbons , whose type of graphs is now called of _ mbius graphs",
    "for the moments ( [ eqn : moment0 ] ) of our vicious walkers , we will perform the mbius graph expansion in the present paper .",
    "now the weights of the graphs are depending on the time @xmath1 ; in the limit @xmath3 all the weights on the twisted ribbons are zero , but they are growing as time @xmath1 going on , and at @xmath9 twisted ribbons are equally weighted as untwisted ones .",
    "this gives another characterization of the temporally inhomogeneity of the process and the gue - to - goe transition .",
    "quite recently nagao , tanemura and one of the present authors applied the method of skew orthogonal polynomials and quaternion determinants developed for the multimatrix models @xcite to the vicious walk problem and derived the quaternion determinantal expressions for dynamical correlation functions @xcite . using this result",
    ", we will present an expression of the coefficients in our expansion of moments using the stirling number of the first kind .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we briefly review the previous results reported in @xcite and give the precise definition of the moments which we will study .",
    "graphical representations are demonstrated in sec.iii .",
    "application of the result of @xcite is given in sec.iv to give the expression for the coefficients of expansion and some concluding remarks are given in sec.v .",
    "appendices a and b are prepared to derive the expression of the density function used in sec.iv and the @xmath18-expansions of the one - point green function discussed in sec.v , respectively .",
    "we study a continuum model of vicious walks , the non - colliding brownian motions in the time interval @xmath23 $ ] , constructed in @xcite as the diffusion scaling limit of vicious random walks on a lattice .",
    "first we briefly review our previous results .",
    "the configuration space of the present @xmath11 vicious walkers is @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a set of all real numbers .",
    "the probability density of vicious walkers at time @xmath16 $ ] with the initial condition that all walkers start from the origin @xmath26 is denoted by @xmath27 .",
    "it was given as @xmath28 with @xmath29 for @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the gamma function , @xmath32 and @xmath33 by using the harish - chandra / itzykson - zuber integral formula @xcite , we will see that @xmath27 is proportional to the integral @xmath34 with @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the @xmath37 diagonal matrix with @xmath38 , and the integrals @xmath39 and @xmath40 are taken over the groups of @xmath37 unitary matrices @xmath41 and real symmetric matrices @xmath42 , respectively . the proportional coefficient is determined so that the probability density is normalized . on the other hand , the integral over @xmath43 in ( [ eqn : p0nt2 ] )",
    "can be regarded as the convolution of the gaussian distribution of complex hermitian matrices @xmath44 with variance @xmath45 and that of real symmetric matrices @xmath43 with variance @xmath46 , and thus we have the expression @xmath47 with @xmath48 where and in the following we use the abbreviations @xmath49 and @xmath50 for the real and the imaginary part of the complex number @xmath51 , respectively , i.e. @xmath52 for @xmath53 with @xmath54 .",
    "remark that , if we set @xmath55 and @xmath56 , @xmath57 is equal to the probability density of the two - matrix model of pandey and mehta with the parameter @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "corresponding to changing the parameter @xmath58 from 1 to 0 in the pandey - mehta two - matrix model , a gue - to - goe transition occurs in the time development of particle distribution in our vicious walks .",
    "now we define the quantity , which we will study in the present paper ; the moment of particle positions in the vicious walks . since the distribution ( [ eqn : p0nt1 ] ) of @xmath59 is symmetric about the origin @xmath26 ,",
    "all of the odd moments vanish .",
    "the even moments are defined and denoted as follows , @xmath60 for @xmath61 .",
    "first we notice that ( [ eqn : p0nt3 ] ) is invariant under any permutation of @xmath62 . then ( [ eqn : mk1 ] ) is written as @xmath63 next we introduce the integration measure for the @xmath37 complex hermitian matrices @xmath64 since @xmath65 , if @xmath66 are the eigenvalues of @xmath44 and @xmath67 ( e.g. see @xcite ) , and @xmath68 for @xmath69 with any unitary matrix @xmath70 , ( [ eqn : mk2 ] ) with ( [ eqn : mu ] ) becomes @xmath71 where @xmath72 for functions @xmath73 of the elements of @xmath44 with @xmath74 note that @xmath75 where the sum is taken over all @xmath76 combinations of indices @xmath77 , and that @xmath78 with the hermitian condition @xmath79 , the integrand @xmath80 in ( [ eqn : mk3 ] ) is a polynomial of the @xmath81 independent random variables @xmath82 . since the probability density ( [ eqn : mu2 ] ) is a product of independent gaussian integration - kernels",
    ", we can apply the wick formula with the variances @xmath83 for @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is kronecker s delta .",
    "we can readily prove that ( [ eqn : wick1 ] ) is equivalent with @xmath86 where @xmath87 is given by ( [ eqn : c ] ) and @xmath88 the wick formula for ( [ eqn : mk3 ] ) is thus    @xmath89    with the identification @xmath90 , where the first sum is taken over all @xmath76 combinations of indices @xmath91 , and the second one over the set of permutations @xmath92 of @xmath93 with the restriction @xmath94 the total number of the terms in the second summation is @xmath95 .      in this section , by performing calculation of the fourth moment @xmath96",
    ", we will demonstrate how to obtain graphical expansions from the wick formula ( [ eqn : mk4 ] ) with the variance ( [ eqn : wick2 ] ) .",
    "we start from the wick formula for @xmath97 , @xmath98 which has @xmath99 terms in the summand of @xmath100 .",
    "substitution of ( [ eqn : wick2 ] ) and binomial expansion give the @xmath101 terms in the form , @xmath102 with    @xmath103    ]    graphically , we prepare a square with four vertices labeled @xmath104 in a cyclic order for each term as shown in fig.1 and connect the vertices @xmath105 and @xmath106 by a line for each kronecker s delta @xmath107 .",
    "we then regard these lines connecting vertices as the hems of ribbons connecting the two edges of the square .",
    "for example , the two lines connecting @xmath108 and @xmath109 in the term @xmath110 are considered as the two hems of a ribbon , say @xmath111 , connecting the edges @xmath112 and @xmath113 of the square , while the lines @xmath114 and @xmath115 are as those of a ribbon , say @xmath116 , connecting @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "there are two ways to connect two distinct edges by a ribbon , by untwisting as @xmath111 and by twisting as @xmath116 in the above example , respectively . for each twisted ribbon",
