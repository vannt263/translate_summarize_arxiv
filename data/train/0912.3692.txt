    "the coalescence of neutron star - neutron star ( ns - ns ) and black hole - neutron star ( bh - ns ) binaries is one of the most promising sources of gravitational waves to be detected by ground based gravitational wave detectors like virgo and ligo @xcite .",
    "these detectors have now reached the planned sensitivity and they will evolve toward a second generation , the advanced ( virgo and ligo ) detectors , with a sensitivity enhanced by an order of magnitude .",
    "furthermore , a design study for an even more sensitive third generation detector , et ( einstein telescope ) , is in progress @xcite .    in a recent study , based on a population synthesis approach @xcite , the formation and",
    "the evolution of compact binary systems has been followed from the onset of star formation , both in the galactic field , where their massive binary progenitors evolve in isolation , and in dense clusters , where they can form at high rates due to dynamical interactions .",
    "the authors estimate that advanced ligo should detect the merger of ns - ns binaries at a rate of @xmath1 events per year and the merger of bh - ns binaries at a rate of @xmath2 per year .",
    "similar estimates hold for the advanced version of virgo .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to expect that in a near future we may be able to detect the gravitational wave ( gw ) signals emitted by these sources and study their features .",
    "a further reason to be interested in these coalescing binaries is that they have been proposed as providing the engine for short gamma - ray bursts ( sgrbs ) ; the detection of a gravitational wave signal emitted by one of these systems in coincidence with a sgrb would validate this model , thus clarifying one of the most interesting open issues in astrophysics .    in this paper",
    "we study the disruption of a neutron star in a bh - ns coalescing binary , to envisage a method to extract information on the equation of state ( eos ) of matter in the ns interior from the detection of the gravitational wave signal emitted in the process .",
    "we use the _ affine model _",
    "approach @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , which treats the ns as an extended object , which responds to its self - gravity , to its internal pressure forces and to the relativistic bh tidal field , under the constraint that its shape is always that of an ellipsoid . in the original formulation of this model , the internal structure of the star was treated at a newtonian level and the eos was assumed to be polytropic . in @xcite",
    "( to be referred to as paper i hereafter ) we have improved this approach by introducing a general relativistic description of the stellar structure , and generalizing the relevant equations to include more general equations of state .",
    "this improved approach has been applied to study quasi - equilibrium sequences of bh - ns binaries , and to determine the critical orbital separation at which the star is torn apart by the black hole tidal field .",
    "when the ns is disrupted before reaching the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) , the emitted gw signal is expected to change abruptly and its amplitude is expected to decrease sharply ; such signal should exhibit a cutoff frequency @xmath0 , corresponding to the orbit at which the disruption occurs , i.e. @xmath3 . this prediction",
    "is confirmed by numerical simulations where the coalescence of a black hole and a neutron star and the tidal disruption of the star have been studied i ) in the framework of newtonian gravity @xcite , @xcite , and ii ) in full general relativity @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the frequency cutoff is a distinctive feature of the waveform emitted by a bh - ns coalescing binary and indicates the disruption of the star .",
    "this was first pointed out in @xcite , where a relation between @xmath0 and the stellar radius was derived , using the formulation of the affine model appearing in @xcite and describing the inspiralling of an incompressible , homogeneous , newtonian ellipsoid moving on circular orbits around a rotating black hole .",
    "hints on the role of the compressibility were derived in @xcite using some results of @xcite , where the same process was studied for a polytropic , newtonian star .",
    "in this paper we study the relation between the cutoff frequency and the neutron star eos . using the same approach developed in paper i",
    ", we explicitly compute for which values of the masses of the binary components and of the black hole angular momentum the star is tidally disrupted before reaching the isco , for a variety of realistic equations of state .",
    "knowing the disruption distance @xmath4 , we evaluate @xmath0 and show how a measure of this quantity from a detected gw signal may be used to infer interesting information on the equation of state of matter in the neutron star interior .",
    "it is known that the fully relativistic numerical study of the last phases of bh - ns binary coalescence is a quite difficult task , especially for large values of the mass ratio @xmath5 ; this is due to a number of reasons , which include the lack of symmetry , the difficulty in evolving the ns while handling the bh singularity , and the prohibitively high computational costs required to span the parameter space ( mass ratio , eos , spins etc . ) . for these reasons ,",
    "the literature on the subject is limited to a restricted number of studies , most of which are in the framework of newtonian gravity .",
    "bh - ns coalescence in general relativity has been studied in the following papers ( see @xcite for a recent review on the subject ) : non spinning black hole and @xmath6 in @xcite ; @xmath7 in @xcite ; @xmath8 in@xcite ; and @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "quasi - equilibrium sequences of black hole - neutron star binaries have been studied in general relativity for @xmath12 .",
    "the case of a rotating black hole has been considered in @xcite , where the coalescence has been studied for three values of the black hole angular momentum ( @xmath13 ) and for @xmath14 , whereas in @xcite the case @xmath15 has been investigated .",
    "it should be stressed that in _ all _ these studies the neutron star is modeled using a polytropic equation of state .",
    "the improved affine model approach which we use in our study is an approximate method , but it has the advantage of allowing one to explore a large region of the parameter space , including large values of the mass ratio @xmath5 , and to use modern equations of state to model matter in the neutron star interior , at a much lower computational cost than fully relativistic simulations .    with respect to ref .",
    "@xcite our study introduces several novelties : we describe the internal structure of the star using general relativity , we explicitly take into account the stellar compressibility and describe the matter inside the star using realistic equations of state ; in addition , in @xcite @xmath0 was provided by the kerr geometry in the approximation of a point mass ns following geodesics in this geometry , while we determine this quantity using the 2.5 post newtonian equations of motion for the orbital dynamics of a binary system .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in section [ affinemodel ]",
    "we briefly describe the affine approach ; in section [ nutide ] we discuss how to determine the cutoff frequency @xmath0 .",
    "the equations of state we employ are briefly described in section [ eos ] ; in section [ errorbar ] we discuss the errors which affect the measure of the binary parameters from a detected gw signal , and how they propagate and affect the evaluation of @xmath0 and of the neutron star radius .",
    "the results of our study are reported in section [ results ] and in section [ concl ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "the equations of the improved affine model approach , which we need in order to determine the radial distance @xmath4 at which the neutron star is torn apart by the tidal interaction with the black hole , are described in detail in paper i. here we will summarise the assumptions underlying this approach and we shall write only the equations to be solved .",
    "we consider a star in the tidal field of a kerr bh whose center of mass follows equatorial , circular orbits ; while moving , the star maintains an ellipsoidal shape ; more precisely it is a riemann - s type ellipsoid , i.e. its spin and vorticity are parallel and their ratio is constant ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the ns equilibrium structure is determined using the stellar structure equations of general relativity , while dynamical behaviour is governed by newtonian hydrodynamics improved by the use of an effective relativistic self - gravity potential .",
    "the equations for the ns deformations are written in the principal frame , i.e. the frame associated with the principal axes of the stellar ellipsoid .",
    "tidal effects on the orbital motion are neglected , as well as the perturbation that the star induces on the bh .",
    "we study the evolution of the system in the quasi - equilibrium approximation , i.e. we neglect all time derivatives appearing in the ordinary differential equations of the model .",
    "physically this means that we assume that the ns follows a quasi - equilibrium sequence during the bh - ns coalescence ; according to the model , moreover , the circulation @xmath16 of the fluid along this sequence is constant . in particular , we set @xmath17 , that is , we consider the ns fluid to be irrotational . in the principal frame ,",
    "the fluid variables of the improved affine model are five : the three principal axes of the stellar ellipsoid @xmath18 and @xmath19 , the angular frequency of the internal fluid motion @xmath20 and the star spin @xmath21 .",
    "the axes @xmath22 and @xmath23 both belong to the orbital plane , while @xmath19 is perpendicular to it ; @xmath22 indicates the axis that lies along the binary orbital radius .",
    "the quasi - equilibrium equations governing these variables are : @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are , respectively , the effective relativistic self - gravity potential and the scalar quadrupole moment of the ns at spherical equilibrium ( see below ) .",
    "@xmath27 is the ns radius and the @xmath28 s are defined as @xmath29 the @xmath30 s denote the components of the bh tidal tensor in the principal frame ; @xmath31  which is connected to @xmath21 by @xmath32  is the angle that brings the parallel - propagated frame in the principal frame , by a rotation around the @xmath19 axis @xcite .",
    "finally , @xmath33 is an angle that governs the rotation of the parallel - propagated frame in order to preserve its parallel transport , and its time evolution is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the bh mass and the bh - ns orbital separation respectively .",

    "we then fix the black hole spin parameter @xmath46 and the binary mass ratio @xmath52 and place the star at a distance @xmath53 from the black hole ( we obviously make sure that the sequence we obtain is independent of @xmath54 ) .",
    "subsequently , we gradually reduce the orbital separation and solve eqs.([eq : a1])-([eq : a3 ] ) at each step and monitor the star axes until a critical separation @xmath4 is reached , at which a quasi - equilibrium configuration is no longer possible .",
    "this critical distance physically corresponds to the tidal disruption of the neutron star .",
    "it may be identified by exploiting the fact that the newton - raphson algorithm can not find any solution to the system of equations , or by calculating numerically the derivative @xmath55 , where @xmath56 and keeping track of it since it tends to zero at tidal disruption : both methods yield the same values of @xmath4 .",
    "we mention that an alternative approach to evaluate @xmath4 in a newtonian framework , based on the estimate of the roche lobe radius , has been used in @xcite .",
    "if the tidal disruption is not encountered , the quasi - equilibrium ends when the neutron star surface crosses the black hole horizon and hence the coalescence terminates with a plunge .    the quantity @xmath4 has to be compared with the value of the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit @xmath57 , which is determined by using the formulae derived in @xcite for a point mass in the gravitational field of a kerr bh : @xmath58^{1/2}\\}\\nonumber\\\\ z_1 & = & 1+(1-a^2/m_{bh}^2)^{1/3}\\nonumber\\\\ & \\times&[(1+a / m_{bh})^{1/3}+(1-a / m_{bh})^{1/3}]\\nonumber\\\\ z_2 & = & ( 3a^2/m_{bh}^2+z_1 ^ 2)^{1/2}\\ , , \\label{risco}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the upper ( lower ) sign holds for co- ( counter-)rotating orbits .",

    ", for a given value of the ns mass , of the radius ( i.e. of the stellar compactness ) and of the mass ratio , the value of @xmath0 evaluated in @xcite is systematically smaller than the value we find .",
    "this happens for a number of reasons .",
    "for instance , let us consider two binary systems having a black hole of the same mass and a neutron star with the same mass and compactness ; in one case the ns structure is computed using the equations of newtonian gravity and an @xmath212 polytropic eos , in the other case using the tov equations and one of the eos we consider in this paper .",
    "if we evaluate the value of @xmath4 for the first system using the affine approach in newtonian gravity as in @xcite , and for the second system using our improved affine approach , we will always find @xmath213 . as a consequence",
    "the value of @xmath0 evaluated by the newtonian approach will be smaller than that evaluated with our improved approach .",
    "furthermore , given the value of @xmath4 , in @xcite @xmath0 is calculated using the formula for a point mass moving on a circular orbit in kerr spacetime , while we compute this quantity using the 2.5 post newtonian equations describing the orbital evolution of a binary system .",
    "this introduces a further difference which makes our @xmath0 larger than that evaluated with the geodesic approximation , and the difference increases when we consider small values of the mass ratio @xmath52 , as shown in fig .",

    "let us assume that a gravitational wave signal has been detected and exhibits a frequency cutoff at , say , @xmath221 hz .",
    "a suitable data analysis on the chirp part of the signal allows to determine the neutron star mass , the mass ratio , with the corresponding uncertainty given in table  [ table1 ] , and the black hole angular momentum with , say , an error of about 10% .",
    "let us suppose that their values are @xmath222 , @xmath223 and @xmath129 , with @xmath122 and @xmath121 given in table  [ table1 ] . with this information , we compute the ns radius versus @xmath0 for the considered eoss as explained in section [ compute ] , and plot the results in fig .  [ fig9 ] .",
    "the two continuous black lines are the parabolic fits of the points which , for each eos , are at the extreme of the horizontal error bar . if we draw a vertical line corresponding to the supposed detected cutoff frequency , i.e. @xmath221 hz , we see that it intercepts the two lines in two points , which identify a region within which the stellar radius should fall . the data shown in fig .  [ fig9 ]",
    "tell us that we would determine the ns radius with an error of 2.5% .",
    "the error would be smaller if the detected value of @xmath0 is smaller , and larger if it is larger .",
    "for instance for @xmath224 hz it would be 3.3% , and 2.2% for @xmath225 hz .",
    "moreover , we would be able to exclude the eoss which fall outside the region framed by the horizontal dashed lines , putting strict constraints on the equation of state inside the neutron star .",
    "in this paper we show that , by detecting a gravitational wave signal emitted by a bh - ns coalescing binary which exhibits a frequency cutoff due to the disruption of the star before the isco , we may be able to determine the radius of the star with quite a good accuracy , of the order of a few percent , and to put strict constraints on the equation of state of matter in the neutron star core .",
    "our study does not intend to be exhaustive , since many more equations of state may be considered in the analysis ; for instance we did not consider quark stars .",
    "there may exist other branches in the plots shown in figs .",
    "[ fig3]-[fig7 ] corresponding to more exotic eoss .",
    "however , from our study it emerges that the quantity which mostly affects @xmath0 is the stellar compactness ; therefore , we expect that in general the cutoff frequencies lay on the parabolic fits which correspond to a given neutron star mass , mass ratio and black hole angular momentum .",
    "a further point which should be discussed is the following . in our analysis",
    "we have assumed that the value of @xmath0 is known from the detection of a gravitational wave signal , but of course this quantity also is affected by uncertainties . for instance , we do not know how quickly the amplitude of the chirp goes to zero at tidal disruption , and therefore how sharp the step in the fourier transform of the gravitational signal @xmath226 at @xmath0 is . to answer this question , an accurate modeling of the bh - ns coalescence process",
    "is certainly needed . moreover , assuming a given `` slope '' in @xmath226 at tidal disruption , how large would the experimental error in the determination of @xmath0 be ?",
    "we plan to investigate this problem with a suitable data analysis study on the data of virgo .",
