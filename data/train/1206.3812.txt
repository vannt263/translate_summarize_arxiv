    "neutrinoproduction of photons and pions from nucleons and nuclei plays an important role in the interpretation of neutrino - oscillation experiments , such as miniboone @xcite .",
    "the neutral current ( nc ) @xmath6 and photon production produce detector signals that resemble those of the desired @xmath7 signals .",
    "currently , it is still a question whether nc photon production might explain the excess events seen at low reconstructed neutrino energies in the miniboone experiment , which the microboone experiment plans to answer @xcite .",
    "moreover , pion absorption after production could lead to events that mimic quasielastic scattering .",
    "ultimately , the calculations must be done on nuclei , which are the primary detector materials in oscillation experiments . to separate the many - body effects from the reaction mechanism and to calibrate the elementary amplitude , we study charged current ( cc ) and nc pion production from free nucleons in this work , which serves as the benchmark . moreover ,",
    "nc photon production , which is not a topic under intense investigation , is studied within this calibrated framework . in future papers",
    ", we will include the electroweak response of the nuclear many - body system to discuss the productions from nuclei in the same framework .",
    "here we use a recently proposed lorentz - covariant meson  baryon effective field theory ( eft ) that was originally motivated by the nuclear many - body problem @xcite .",
    "( this formalism is often called _ quantum hadrodynamics _ or qhd . )",
    "this qhd eft includes all the relevant symmetries of the underlying qcd ; in particular , the approximate , spontaneously broken @xmath8 chiral symmetry is realized nonlinearly .",
    "the motivation for this eft and some calculated results are discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this eft , we have the @xmath0 resonance consistently incorporated as an explicit degree of freedom , while respecting the underlying symmetries of qcd noted earlier .",
    "( the generation of mesons and the @xmath0 resonance through pion - pion interactions and pion - nucleon interactions has been investigated in @xcite . )",
    "we are concerned with the intermediate - energy region @xmath9 , where the resonant behavior of the @xmath0 becomes important .",
    "the details about introducing @xmath0 degree of freedom , the full lagrangian , and electroweak interactions in this model have been presented in @xcite .",
    "the well - known pathologies associated with introducing @xmath0 are not relevant in the context of eft .",
    "the couplings to electroweak fields are included using the external field technique @xcite , which allows us to deduce the electroweak currents .",
    "because of the approximate symmetries in the lagrangian , the vector currents are automatically conserved and the axial - vector currents are partially conserved .",
    "form factors are generated within the theory by vector meson dominance ( vmd ) , which allows us to avoid introducing phenomenological form factors and makes current conservation manifest .. in other approaches , for example @xcite , these form factors are introduced by hand , which requires specific relations between the nucleon vector current and the pion vector current form factors .",
    "this is explained in secs .",
    "[ sec : currentmatrixelement ] and [ sec : diag ] .",
    "] we discuss the power counting of both vertices and diagrams on and off resonance and consistently keep all tree - level diagrams through next - to - leading order .",
    "explicit power - counting of loop diagrams in this eft has been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "the contributions of the loops are assumed to be ( mostly ) saturated by heavy mesons and the @xmath0 resonance , so the couplings of contact interactions are viewed as being renormalized .",
    "the mesons role in effective field theory has also been investigated in @xcite .",
    "one major goal of this work is to calibrate electroweak interactions on the nucleon level .",
    "it is typically assumed that the vector part of the @xmath10 transition current is well constrained by electromagnetic interactions @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty is in the axial - vector part of the current , which is determined by fitting to argonne national laboratory ( anl ) @xcite and brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) @xcite bubble - chamber data .",
    "the data have large error bars , which leads to significant model dependence in the fitted results @xcite . here",
    "we choose one recently fitted parametrization @xcite and use it to determine the constants of our vmd parametrization ( but note that our basis of currents is different from the conventional one as used in @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , we make use of other form factors , the ones in @xcite for example . we then compare results of using different current basis and form factors with the data at low and intermediate neutrino energies .",
    "there have been numerous earlier studies of neutrinoproduction of pions from nucleons in the resonance region @xcite .",
    "they basically fall into two categories . in the first one @xcite resonance dominance above intermediate energy",
    "is assumed .",
    "the contributions of resonances are summed incoherently and hence it is difficult to determine the interference effect . in the second category , @xcite , the contributions are summed coherently including the background , since either an effective hamiltonian or lagrangian is utilized .",
    "our approach belongs to the second category , while differences from other models should be mentioned .",
    "first , there exists a finite energy range in which eft is valid , so we insist on low - energy calculations .",
    "however , a different attitude has been taken , for example , in refs .",
    "@xcite , in which the born approximation based on an effective lagrangian has been extrapolated to the region of several gev .",
    "second , we have discussed the consequence of higher - order contact terms .",
    "naturally , these contributions should obey naive power counting @xcite ; however , some of them may play an important role in scattering from nuclei .",
    "third , electroweak interactions of nucleons are calibrated in this work while the strong interaction has been calibrated to nuclear properties .",
    "this is a unique feature that is absent in other models targeting the production from free nucleons only .",
    "furthermore , the calibration on the nucleon s electroweak interaction impacts the strong interaction .",
    "for example , the @xmath11 coupling , introduced because of vmd in the pion s vector current , gives rise to an interesting contribution in the two - body axial current in a many - body calculation @xcite .",
    "in our theory with @xmath0 , it can be quite interesting to investigate similar consequences , for example , the @xmath0 s role in the two - body current , in which meson - dominance couplings can give rise to relevant interactions .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : lnodelta ] and  [ sec : ldelta ] , we introduce our lagrangian without and with @xmath0 , and we calculate several current matrix elements that will be useful for the subsequent feynman diagram calculations . the theory involving @xmath0 is emphasized .",

    "neutrinoproduction of photons and pions from nucleons and nuclei produce important backgrounds in neutrino - oscillation experiments and therefore must be understood quantitatively . in this work , we studied the productions from free nucleons in a lorentz - covariant , chirally invariant , meson  baryon eft . for ( anti)neutrino energy around @xmath241 ,",
    "the @xmath0 resonance is important .",
    "we therefore included the @xmath0 degrees of freedom explicitly in our eft lagrangian , in a manner that is consistent with both lorentz covariance and chiral symmetry .",

    "because of the symmetries built into our lagrangian , the vector and baryon currents are conserved and the axial - vector currents are partially conserved automatically , which is not true in some other approaches to this problem ( with special constraints among different form factors having to be introduced by hand to conserve vector current in other approaches ) .",

    "moreover , we studied the convergence of our power - counting scheme at low energies ( where the @xmath0 needs to be counted differently in different energy regions ) and found that next - to - leading - order tree - level corrections are small .",
    "this power counting scheme is different from the canonical one , because it can be used in nuclear many body problems .",

    "the difference between the nc photon production and pion production is that , at @xmath179 , no diagrams contribute in the photon case , while there are several in pion production .",
