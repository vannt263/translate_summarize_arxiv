    "this paper is dedicated to professor kleinert on the occasion of his 60th birthday with special thanks for the exciting years i had the good fortune to be his _ wissenschaftlicher assistent _ at the freie universitt berlin .",
    "it is an implementation of one of the many neat ideas he shared with me over the years .",
    "this particular one he told me about four years ago in the late summer of 1996 .",
    "it is a commonly held belief that the order of an equilibrium phase transition can be inferred from the form of the effective potential at criticality .",
    "the presence of , for example , a cubic term in the order parameter is taken as signalling a discontinuous transition , while the absence of such a term is taken as indicating a continuous transition . at the mean - field level , where fluctuations in the order parameter are ignored ,",
    "this is certainly true@xcite .",
    "however , the question about the order of a transition is settled in the full theory , and fluctuations may well change the mean - field result .    in a renormalization - group ( rg )",
    "approach , a continuous phase transition is associated with an infrared - stable fixed point in the space of coupling parameters characterizing the theory . sufficiently close to the transition , such a fixed point acts as an attractor to which the couplings flow when one passes to larger length scales by integrating out field fluctuations of smaller length scales .",
    "when no infrared - stable fixed point is detected in this process , the transition is discontinuous .",
    "it is important to note that a fixed point is probed by changing a scale .",
    "the effective potential evaluated at criticality in itself is inadequate for this as it lacks a scale . in this contribution",
    "we show that a scale can be introduced by extending the effective potential to include derivative terms .",
    "the resulting effective free energy contains the same information as that obtained in rg . along",
    "the way we are able to implement kleinert s idea of finding a fixed point without calculating flow functions first .",
    "to be specific we consider the superconductor - normal phase transition described by the o(@xmath0 ) ginzburg - landau model , which has been one of kleinert s research topics for many years , and to which a large part of the first volume of his textbook@xcite _ gauge fields in condensed matter _ is devoted .",
    "the model is specified by the free energy density ( in the notation of statistical physics ) @xmath1 with a complex order parameter @xmath2 having an even number @xmath0 of real field components : @xmath3 a conventional superconductor with cooper pairing in the s - channel corresponds to @xmath4 .",
    "the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the electric charge and mass of the field , while @xmath7 is the coupling constant characterizing the 4th - order interaction term .",
    "we included a gauge - fixing term with parameter @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the ( magnetic ) field strength . for convenience we will work in the gauge @xmath10 , which is implemented by taking the limit @xmath11 .",
    "the mass term depends on the temperature @xmath12 , and changes sign at the critical temperature @xmath13 . in the ginzburg - landau model , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the length scale of fluctuations in the amplitude of the order parameter .        as a first step to investigate the effect of fluctuations on the mean - field picture ,",
    "we consider , following halperin , lubensky , and ma@xcite , those in the vector field @xmath16 . since ( at least in the normal phase )",
    "the corresponding mode is gapless , it can have an important impact on the infrared behavior of the theory .",
    "the functional integral over @xmath16 is a simple gaussian and gives as contribution to the effective potential energy density in @xmath17 dimensions @xmath18 assuming that the order parameter is a nonfluctuating background field denoted by @xmath19 . in deriving this",
    ", it is used that the combination @xmath20 which appears in intermediate steps , is a projection operator satisfying @xmath21 , and that its trace gives the number of transverse components : @xmath22 .",
    "the momentum integral is easily carried out using dimensional regularization , with the result @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the gamma function . for @xmath25 ,",
    "this leads to the cubic term in the effective potential mentioned in the introduction@xcite .",
    "the 1-loop contribution is to be added to the mean - field potential @xmath26 , and is often taken as indicating a discontinuous phase transition at a  what kleinert@xcite likes to call  precocious temperature @xmath27 above the mean - field critical temperature @xmath13 , @xmath28 where the mass term is still positive , and the order parameter jumps from zero to the finite value @xmath29 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : pot ] ) .",
    "since this result is obtained in perturbation theory , both @xmath5 and @xmath7 are assumed to be small .",
    "this still leaves the ratio of the two , or the so - called ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath30 undetermined .",
    "this parameter separates type - ii ( @xmath31 ) superconductors , which have a meissner phase where an applied magnetic field can penetrate the sample in the form of quantized flux tubes , and type - i ( @xmath32 ) superconductors , for which these flux tubes become unstable .",
    "neglecting fluctuations in the order parameter , as is done here , is valid in the type - i regime , where @xmath33 is small .",
    "( in the opposite limit , of deep type - ii superconductors where @xmath33 is large , fluctuations in the vector field can be neglected instead . )",
    "this then led to the conclusion that type - i superconductors undergo a discontinuous phase transition@xcite .",
    "it should , however , be noted that fluctuations in the order parameter produce at criticality also a cubic term in the effective potential . according to this argument",
    ", this would imply that also type - ii superconductors should undergo such a transition .",
    "as the result discussed in this section is independent of the number of field components , it should be valid for any @xmath0 , including large numbers .",
    "this opens the possibility to check it using a @xmath34 expansion .",
    "the @xmath34 expansion can be applied when the number @xmath0 of field components is large , so that its inverse provides the theory with a small parameter .",
    "contributions are then ordered not according to the number of loops , as in the loop expansion , but according to the number of factors @xmath34 . the leading contribution in @xmath34 due to fluctuations in the vector field",
    "is obtained by dressing its correlation function with arbitrary many bubble insertions , and summing the entire set of feynman diagrams@xcite .",
    "the resulting series is a simple geometrical one , which leads to the following change in the correlation function : @xmath35 where @xmath36 , with @xmath37 the 1-loop integral @xmath38 below @xmath39 , the infrared behavior has become less singular as a result of including the bubble insertions . instead of the effective potential ( [ veff ] )",
    ", we now obtain @xmath40 for large fields , @xmath41 , the main contribution to the integral comes from large momenta , where @xmath42 , so that in this limit we recover the result ( [ vfinal ] ) obtained in the loop expansion : @xmath43 . in the limit of small fields , on the other hand ,",
    "the main contribution comes from small momenta , where @xmath44 .",
    "we then find latexmath:[${\\cal v}_{\\rm eff } \\propto    @xmath34 expansion no longer gives a cubic term in the effective potential .",
    "[ this argument captures only those terms in the taylor expansion of the logarithm in the effective potential ( [ vlargen ] ) which diverge in the infrared .",
    "these are the important ones for our purposes as they can produce nonanalytic behavior .",
    "the first terms in the expansion may be infrared finite , depending on the dimensionality @xmath17 , and have to be treated separately .",
    "but they always lead to analytic terms and are therefore of no concern to us here . ]",
    "the @xmath34 expansion calls into question the validity of the result obtained in the loop expansion as it corresponds to large field values and it is not clear whether this is still in the realm of perturbation theory .",
    "in the next section , we show that by extending the calculation of the effective potential to that of the effective free energy , which includes derivative terms , matters become consistent and in agreement with rg .",
    "when computing the effective free energy , not only fluctuations in the vector field are to be considered , but also those in the order parameter . to this end , we set @xmath46 with @xmath47 a nonfluctuating background field , and integrate out the fluctuating field @xmath48 .",
    "the main difference with the previous calculation of the effective potential is that the background field is no longer assumed to be constant , but can vary in space .",
    "we therefore also have to analyze the derivative terms in the effective theory .",
    "because of gauge invariance , the results will depend solely on the absolute value @xmath49 . without loss of generality",
    "we can therefore assume that the background field @xmath19 has only one nonzero component , say the first one , @xmath50 .",
    "for convenience we will work at criticality and set the mass parameter @xmath6 to zero .    a straightforward calculation yields in the gauge @xmath10 the 1-loop effective free energy @xmath51 & = & \\frac{1}{2 } { \\rm tr } \\ln \\left(1 + 3 \\lambda \\frac{1}{p^2 } v^2 \\right ) + \\frac{n-2}{2 } { \\rm tr } \\ln \\left(1 + \\lambda \\frac{1}{p^2 } v^2 \\right )   \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{2 } { \\rm tr } \\ln \\left [ \\left ( \\begin{array}{cc } 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\delta_{\\mu \\rho } \\end{array } \\right ) + \\frac{1}{p^2 } \\left ( \\begin{array}{cc } 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & p_{\\mu \\nu}(p ) \\end{array } \\right ) \\left ( \\begin{array}{cc } \\lambda v^2 & e \\partial_\\nu v \\\\",
    "e \\partial_\\rho v & e^2 v^2 \\delta_{\\nu \\rho } \\end{array } \\right ) \\right ] , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we ignored an irrelevant constant , and the trace tr denotes the trace tr over discrete indices as well as the integration over momentum and space .",
    "more precisely , @xmath52 = { \\rm tr } \\int d^dx \\ , \\int \\frac{d^d k}{(2 \\pi)^d } \\ , { \\rm e}^{- i k \\cdot x } \\ln[1 + k(x , p ) ] \\ , { \\rm e}^{i k \\cdot x},\\ ] ] with @xmath53 the derivative operating on everything to its right . since the background field is space - dependent , the integrals in eq .",
    "( [ seff ] ) can not be evaluated in closed form , but only in a derivative expansion @xcite .",
    "the first step in this scheme is to expand the logarithm in a taylor series .",
    "each term of the series contains powers of the derivative @xmath54 , which in the second step are shifted to the left using the identity @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are arbitrary functions .",
    "the symbol @xmath58 in the last term denotes the derivative which , in contrast to @xmath54 , operates _ only _ on the next object to its right .",
    "the next step is to repeatedly integrate by parts until all the @xmath54 derivatives operate to the left .",
    "they then simply produce factors of @xmath59 as only the function @xmath60 appears at the left . in shorthand , for an arbitrary function @xmath61 : @xmath62 ignoring total derivatives .",
    "in this way , all occurrences of the derivative operator @xmath54 are replaced with a mere integration variable @xmath59 . the function @xmath63 at the right",
    "can now be moved to the left where it is annihilated by the function @xmath64 .",
    "the momentum integration can then , in principle , be performed and the effective free energy takes the form of a space integral over a local density @xmath65 .    applied to the formal expression ( [ seff ] ) , the derivative expansion yields for the quadratic terms in the expansion of the logarithms there , the following terms in the effective free energy density : @xmath66 , we can replace all occurrences of the derivative @xmath67 with @xmath68 .",
    "it is important to note the absence of infrared divergences here since @xmath68 acts as an infrared cutoff .",
    "without such a cutoff , as in the effective potential ( [ veff ] ) , the individual terms in the taylor expansion can not be integrated because of infrared divergences , and the entire series has to be summed , which can lead to nonanalytic contributions . from the perspective of rg ,",
    "the presence of the momentum scale @xmath68 is crucial as it allows the study of the fixed point by letting that scale approach zero .    with the tree contribution @xmath69 added , we obtain after carrying out the integrals over the loop momentum @xmath70 \\left|\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi\\right|^2 + \\left\\ { \\hat{\\lambda } - c \\left [ ( n+8 ) \\hat{\\lambda}^2 + d(d-1 ) \\hat{e}^4 \\right ] \\right\\ } \\kappa^{4-d } |\\phi|^4,\\ ] ] where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the rescaled dimensionless coupling constants . as an aside , by evaluating the integrals in fixed dimension @xmath73 , and not in an @xmath74 expansion close to the upper critical dimension @xmath39 , we in effect implement parisi s approach to critical phenomena@xcite .",
    "the factor in front of the kinetic term in eq.([eval ] ) amounts to a field renormalization",
    ". it can be absorbed by introducing the renormalized field @xmath75 , with @xmath76 the field renormalization factor @xmath77 the effective free energy density then becomes @xmath78 with @xmath79 the renormalized coupling @xmath80.\\ ] ] it was kleinert s idea to put this equation in this form .",
    "the reason being that the critical point is approached by letting the momentum scale approach zero .",
    "since the original coupling constant @xmath7 is fixed , the left side tends to zero when @xmath81 .",
    "the resulting quadratic equation then determines the value of @xmath82 at the critical point , provided we know the value of @xmath83 there .",
    "this procedure is equivalent to finding the root of the flow equation for @xmath82 in conventional rg@xcite .    to obtain the value of @xmath83 at criticality",
    ", we rescale the vector field @xmath84 and consider it instead of the order parameter to be the background field . the 1-loop effective free energy obtained after integrating out the scalar fields reads : @xmath85 = \\frac{n}{2 } { \\rm tr } \\ln \\left[1 + \\frac{1}{p^2 } ( 2 p_\\mu a_\\mu - a_\\mu^2 ) \\right],\\ ] ] where we again ignored an irrelevant constant and used the gauge @xmath86 .",
    "the second term in the expansion of the logarithm yields the first nonzero contribution @xmath87 if we assume that the vector field carries the same momentum @xmath68 as does the order parameter , we obtain after carrying out the momentum integral for the sum of the tree and the 1-loop contribution @xmath88 with @xmath89 the renormalized coupling constant , @xmath90 keeping @xmath5 fixed and letting @xmath81 to approach the critical point , we see that the renormalized coupling tends to a constant value @xmath91 when this value is substituted in eq .",
    "( [ lasol ] ) with the left side set to zero , the resulting quadratic equation in @xmath82 has two real solutions @xmath92,\\ ] ] provided that the determinant @xmath93 is real . for fixed dimensionality , this condition is satisfied only for a sufficient number of field components @xmath0 . specifically , the minimum number in @xmath94 is @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and@xcite @xmath97 .",
    "the plus sign in eq.([deltad ] ) corresponds to the infrared - stable fixed point , while the minus sign corresponds to the tricritical point , where the continuous phase transition changes to a discontinuous one . for a fixed number of field components @xmath0",
    ", this 1-loop result shows that continuous behavior is favored when @xmath98 , while in the opposite limit , @xmath99 , discontinuous behavior is favored .",
    "for a conventional 3-dimensional superconductor corresponding to @xmath4 , the 1-loop result fails to give an infrared - stable fixed point .",
    "it should , however , be kept in mind that there are infinitely many loop diagrams , and the values of the coupling constants at criticality are not particular small to justify low - order perturbation theory .",
    "for example , @xmath100 according to eq.([esol ] ) with @xmath25 , which only for large @xmath0 is small .",
    "different approaches are therefore required to investigate the presence of a fixed point .",
    "one is the dual approach@xcite , which is a formulation in terms of magnetic vortex loops .",
    "monte carlo simulations of the dual model led to the conclusion that 3-dimensional type - ii superconductors undergo a continuous phase transition belonging to the xy universality class with an inverted temperature axis@xcite . using this approach ,",
    "kleinert@xcite predicted the presence of a tricritical point at a value of the ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath101 .",
    "another approach within the framework of the ginzburg - landau model itself was put forward in ref .",
    "@xcite , where  in our language  the vector field was assumed to carry not the same momentum @xmath68 as the order parameter , but @xmath102 instead .",
    "the charged fixed points for @xmath4 and @xmath25 are then located at @xmath103 which becomes small for large @xmath104 , facilitating the existence of an infrared - stable fixed point .",
    "the free parameter @xmath104 was determined by matching @xmath105 with kleinert s estimate or monte carlo simulations@xcite which gave @xmath106 .",
    "form eqs .",
    "( [ esol ] ) and ( [ tri ] ) one obtains with the parameter @xmath104",
    "included@xcite @xmath107 the resulting values for the critical exponents are consistent with the expected ( inverted ) xy universality class .",
    "also resummation techniques applied to results @xcite obtained to 2nd - order in the loop expansion predict the existence of an infrared - stable fixed point in the ginzburg - landau model@xcite .    in conclusion , by extending the effective potential to include derivative terms , we achieved agreement with rg as they provide the theory with a low momentum scale which can be varied to probe the fixed point .",
    "the presence of a nonanalytic term in the effective potential at criticality was argued to be immaterial as far as the order of the phase transition is concerned .",
