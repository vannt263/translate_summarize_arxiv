    "density functional theory@xcite ( dft ) has proved to be a vital tool in gaining information on many gas - surface processes .",
    "this may be surprising , since dft is only valid for relaxed systems in their ground state and therefore not directly applicable to dynamical situations .",
    "however , often the electrons relax much faster than the time scale of the atomic movement , such that the electron gas can be considered relaxed in its ground state at all times .",
    "then potential energy surfaces ( pes ) of the ground state obtained by dft , or any other method , can be used to describe the motion of atomic cores .",
    "this is the born - oppenheimer approximation .    in some situations",
    ", however , the born - oppenheimer approximation is not valid .",
    "this is for example the case when the electronic system is excited by a femtosecond laser@xcite or hot electrons are produced with a metal - insulator - metal junction.@xcite the born - oppenheimer approximation also breaks down if the time scales for the electronic and nuclear motions are comparable or if the separations between the electronic states are very small , such that transitions between the electronic states will occur . in these situations",
    "it is necessary to go beyond the born - oppenheimer approximation either by considering the coupling between electronic states@xcite where it becomes necessary to obtain pess of excited states , or by an electronic friction model.@xcite    the problem of calculating excitation energies are being approached in many different ways , even within dft .",
    "time dependent density functional theory ( tddft)@xcite gives , compared to the computational cost , good agreement with experiments for excitations in atoms and molecules.@xcite however , tddft suffers some problems in excitations involving charge transfer.@xcite the gw approximation@xcite can be used to gain accurate excitation energies for molecules and clusters .",
    "the embedding method,@xcite which combines high - accuracy quantum chemistry methods with dft , makes it possible to handle larger periodic systems with great accuracy .",
    "the embedding theory has been applied to estimate pess of excited molecules on surfaces.@xcite however , the computational cost and involved complexity is still very high .",
    "our aim has been to find a method , which at a computational cost close the level of ground state dft can estimate excited state energies of molecules on surfaces with reasonable accuracy .",
    "such a method would make it more feasible to consider a large range of systems in search of systems with interesting or desired properties .    constrained dft@xcite and @xmath0scf@xcite are two different approaches , which both can be considered as small extensions of ground state dft , such that the computational cost lies close to that of ground state dft . in constrained dft",
    "an additional potential is introduced and varied until a certain constraint on the electrons is fulfilled .",
    "the simplest approach is to lower ( or increase ) the potential in a certain part of space until you have the desired number electrons in this area.@xcite a different approach is to introduce potentials on the orbitals in a localized basis set , which depends on the orbitals positions in space.@xcite in section [ sec : mol_on_surf ] we will argue that when considering molecular resonance states on surfaces it may be problematic with such a strict constraint on the electrons , since a part of the charge may return to the surface on a much shorter time - scale than the lifetime of the resonance .    in the @xmath0scf scheme the positions of the electrons are controlled by controlling the occupation of the kohn - sham ( ks ) states as the system reaches self - consistency .",
    "the @xmath0scf scheme has for a long time been justified in cases , where the excited state corresponds to the lowest state of a given symmetry.@xcite the scheme has , however , often been applied to more general cases .",
    "more recently , grling@xcite extended the ks formalism to include excited states , such that @xmath0scf gets a formal justification in the general case , although a special unknown orbital - dependent exchange - correlation potential should be used for the excited states . in practical implementations standard exchange - correlation potentials from ground state dft",
    "are typically used .",
    "this traditional way of just controlling the occupation of the ks orbitals has some limitations .",
    "for example when a molecule is placed on a metallic surface the molecular orbitals will hybridize with the orbitals in the surface , such that the molecular orbitals will be spread over several ks states .",
    "for such systems there is no good way of representing a resonance on the molecule as a change in the occupations of the ks orbitals .",
    "the optimal thing one can do within this scheme is to occupy the ks orbital with the largest overlap with the molecular orbital in question , but this overlap can be quite small and highly system size dependent . this problem was also pointed out by hellman et al.@xcite  and behler et al.@xcite    in this paper we modify the @xmath0scf approach , such that electrons are allowed to occupy arbitrary linear combinations of ks orbitals . in this way",
    "one achieves much better control on the position of the excited electron .",
    "as is the case for traditional @xmath0scf some knowledge of the resonance one wants to consider is needed in order to apply the method .",
    "the method is especially relevant in newns - andersson@xcite type systems , where a resonance can be attributed to a known single level , which has been hybridized through interactions with other states .",
    "this includes systems with molecules adsorbed on metal surfaces and molecules trapped between to metal contacts .",
    "the modification we propose only has minor implications on the way practical calculations are performed , which is very similar to performing an ordinary ground state dft calculation . in the following",
    "we will go through the details of the method and apply it to a few diatomic molecules on metallic surfaces .",
    "the obtained results will be compared to the ordinary @xmath0scf method , spatially constrained dft and ipes measurements .",
    "finally we present some tests on the performance of the @xmath0scf approach on n@xmath1 and co in the gas phase .",
    "in the following we go through the differences between the linear expansion @xmath0scf method we propose , ordinary @xmath0scf and standard dft . we start by stating the modification of the ks equations when considering an electron excited from the fermi level to a higher lying state .",
    "then we show how this affects the energy calculation .",
    "finally we generalize the approach to other types of excitations .",
    "the fundamental ks equations@xcite represent a practical way of finding the ground state electron density for a given external potential and a given number of electrons through an iterative process . @xmath3({\\mathbf{r}})\\right]\\psi_i({\\mathbf{r}})=\\epsilon_i\\psi_i({\\mathbf{r } } ) \\label{eq : ks_s}\\\\ n({\\mathbf{r}})=\\sum_{i=1}^n\\psi^*_i({\\mathbf{r}})\\psi_i({\\mathbf{r } } ) \\label{eq : ks_n } \\\\",
    "v_{ks}[n]({\\mathbf{r}})=v_{ext}({\\mathbf{r}})+\\int d{\\mathbf{r}}'\\frac{n({\\mathbf{r}}')}{\\vert { \\mathbf{r}}-{\\mathbf{r } } ' \\vert } + \\frac{\\delta e_{xc}}{\\delta n({\\mathbf{r}})},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the ks potential , @xmath5 is the exchange - correlation energy and @xmath6 is the number of electrons . as seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ks_n ] ) only the @xmath6 orbitals with lowest energy contribute to the density , ie .",
    "the electrons are placed in these orbitals.@xcite in ordinary @xmath0scf one estimates properties of excited states by placing the electrons differently .",
    "for example the homo - lumo gap in a molecule could be estimated by replacing eq .",
    "( [ eq : ks_n ] ) with @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the ks orbital resembling the lumo from the ground - state calculation .",
    "naturally , the ks orbitals found when solving these modified ks equations will differ from the ones found in an ordinary dft calculation , due to the change in the hamilton through the change in the density when different orbitals are occupied .    in the linear expansion @xmath0scf method",
    "we propose , the excited electron is not forced to occupy a ks orbital , but can occupy any orbital that is a linear combination of empty ks orbitals : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the number of ks orbitals in the calculation . in practice this means that the ks many - particle wavefunction is no longer just a slater determinant of @xmath6 ks orbitals , but a slater determinant of @xmath11 ks orbitals and @xmath12 . only empty ks orbitals are included in the linear expansion , since otherwise @xmath12 will not be orthogonal to the filled ks orbitals .",
    "( [ eq : ks_n ] ) is then replaced with @xmath13 since the expansion coefficients , @xmath14 , in principle could have any value some a priori knowledge is needed in order to choose good values . in the case of molecular resonances on surfaces",
    "the expansion coefficients are chosen such that @xmath12 resembles the relevant molecular orbital as much as possible , ie .",
    "@xmath15 where @xmath16 is the molecular orbital .",
    "this is consistent with a newns - andersson@xcite picture , where the resonance corresponds to an electron getting in the molecular orbital , but the resonance broadening and energy shift is due to hybridization with the metallic bands and an image charge effect .    in calculations with k - point sampling the linear expansion is performed independently in all k - points . in the linear expansion @xmath0scf one then avoids the difficulties one can encounter in choosing which ks state to occupy in each k - point in the traditional way of performing @xmath0scf calculations : for example one may risk occupying different bands in each k - point , when just choosing the ks orbital with the largest overlap with the molecular orbital in each k - point .      the energy calculation , which is performed after the ks equations have reached self consistency , is not significantly different in the linear expansion @xmath0scf scheme compared to ordinary dft .",
    "the hartree energy is evaluated directly from the density , which is also the case for the exchange - correlation energy if an orbital independent functional is used .",
    "so in linear expansion @xmath0scf these terms are evaluated exactly as in ordinary dft . in ordinary dft",
    "the kinetic energy is evaluated as @xmath17&= & \\sum_{i=1}^n\\langle\\psi_i\\vert-\\frac{\\nabla^2}{2}\\vert\\psi_i\\rangle \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\sum_{i=1}^n\\epsilon_i - \\int v_{ks}[n]({\\mathbf{r}})n({\\mathbf{r}})d{\\mathbf{r}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the last equality is seen directly from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ks_s ] ) .",
    "similarly the expression for the kinetic energy in the linear expansion @xmath0scf is found to be @xmath17&=&\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\\epsilon_i + \\sum_{i = n}^{m}\\vert a_i\\vert^2\\epsilon_i -\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\int v_{ks}[n]({\\mathbf{r}})n({\\mathbf{r}})d{\\mathbf{r}}\\label{eq : dscf_t}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for orbital dependent exchange - correlation functionals some effort must be put into ensuring that the exchange - correlation energy is evaluated correctly .",
    "this should however be quite straightforward , since all the occupied orbitals are known .",
    "gradients of pess are easily evaluated in ordinary dft due to the hellman - feynman theorem .",
    "the hellman - feynman theorem , however , only applies to eigenstates and not linear expansions of eigenstates . due to this",
    "there is no easy way of gaining the gradients in a linear expansion @xmath0scf calculation . in section [ sec : gradients_calc ]",
    "we will show that the hellman - feynman gradients do in fact not match the true gradients .",
    "above we only considered excitations where an electron is removed from the fermi energy and placed in some specified orbital .",
    "the method is , however , easily extended to other types of excitations by representing each removed and each added electron as a linear expansion of ks orbitals .",
    "( [ eq : dscf_n ] ) then gains an extra sum for each extra linear expansion . in cases of removed electrons",
    "the sign should of course be negative and the sum be over ks states below the fermi energy . similarly eq .",
    "( [ eq : dscf_t ] ) gains extra sums .",
    "we have implemented the method in ` gpaw`,@xcite which is a real - space dft code that uses the projector - augmented waves@xcite ( paw ) formalism to represent the core electrons .",
    "the self - consistent electron density is determined by an iterative diagonalization of the ks hamiltonian and pulay mixing of the resulting density.@xcite for calculations on single molecules we use the local density approximation ( lda)@xcite as well as rpbe@xcite to describe exchange and correlation effects .",
    "the lda is used because we compare to tddft results obtained using the alda approximation.@xcite and rpbe is used to see whether or not the generalized gradient description improves results . for calculations on molecules at surfaces we only use rpbe , because this is designed to perform well for molecules adsorbed on transition metal surfaces .",
    "the projection step described in section [ sec : method_ks ] can easily be approximated within the paw formalism if the atomic orbitals are chosen as partial waves ; see appendix [ app : paw ] for details .    for reasons of comparison",
    "we have also made a few linear response tddft ( lrtddft ) calculations .",
    "these have been made using the ` octopus ` code,@xcite which is a real - space tddft code using norm - conserving pseudopotentials to represent core electrons .",
    "the linear expansion @xmath0scf method is especially relevant for molecules on metallic surfaces , because the molecular state , due to hybridization , is spread over many ks states , ie .",
    "it is necessary to write the resonant state as a linear combination of ks states . in this section",
    "we will make a detailed investigation of the 2@xmath2 resonance of n@xmath1 on a ruthenium ( 0001 ) surface .",
    "furthermore we apply the proposed method to several diatomic molecules on different metallic surfaces and compare the results to other methods and experiments .",
    "finally we map out a part of the pess for n@xmath1 on ruthenium ( 0001 ) and use it to estimate how much energy could possible be put into molecular motion from an electron hitting the resonance .",
    "the two top panels on fig .",
    "[ fig : bader_convergence ] shows the @xmath18 resonance energy for n@xmath1 on a ruthenium ( 0001 ) surface as a function of the system size , ie .",

    "right panels are for a ( 2,1 ) surface cell and different number of layers .",
    "the extra amount of charge is estimated using bader decomposition.@xcite , scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the resonance energy is the total energy difference between a resonant calculation and a ground state calculation , both performed with atomic positions corresponding to the minimum of the ground state pes , ie .",
    "it is vertical resonance energies .",
    "we minimize the energy in the ground state calculations by keeping all surface atoms frozen and found that the nitrogen molecule is placed on - top with the two nitrogen atoms placed 2.084  and 3.201  above the surface . in the resonance calculation the @xmath19 orbital of the n@xmath1 molecule has been expanded on all ks states above the fermi energy .",
    "this expansion has been used as @xmath20 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : psi_res ] ) .",
    "although an extra electron is placed on the molecule we keep the total number of electrons unchanged , such that the unit cell is neutral .",
    "this is reasonable because a charged molecule will form an image charge in the surface , keeping the entire system neutral .",
    "the resonance energy is converged to within 0.1 ev at a surface unit cell of ( 2,2 ) .",
    "the rather large variation in energy for smaller unit cells is probably due to dipole interactions between periodic images .",
    "this is confirmed by a simple estimation of the dipol - dipol interaction energies .",
    "the resonance energy is not influenced significantly by the number of layers in the ruthenium , indicating that the charge redistribution only occurs very near to the surface .",
    "that the charge redistribution is local is confirmed by fig .",
    "[ fig : vtk_run2_area ] , which shows the change in charge between the resonance calculation and the ground state calculation for 4 different surface unit cells .",
    "+        for the larger unit cells , where the resonance energy has converged , a clearly localized image charge is seen below the nitrogen molecule and above the first layer of ruthenium atoms .",
    "the area with extra charge clearly resembles the @xmath18 orbital of nitrogen , indicating that the @xmath18 orbital is well represented by the linear expansion of ks orbitals .",
    "[ fig : vtk_run2_area ] also reveals that some charge is redistributed within the molecule .    in order to get an estimate of the size of the charge redistribution we also performed bader decomposition@xcite on the density found in the ground state calculation and the resonance calculation .",

    "the converged value is close to 0.5 electron charge , ie .",
    "only half of the electron is placed on the nitrogen molecule according to the bader decomposition .",
    "this discrepancy could either be due to the ambiguity in the way one chooses to assign charge to the atoms or a more physical effect of charge going back into the surface when extra charge is placed on the molecule .",
    "the former reason is very likely , since the image charge is located very close to the molecule .    in order to investigate the effect of charge going back into the surface",
    "we start by considering the @xmath18 orbital itself .",

    "the pdos has moved upward in energy such that the tail no longer goes below the fermi energy , ie .",
    "some charge goes back into the surface as charge is placed on the molecule .",
    "similar effects are seen for the other molecular orbitals as visualized on fig .",
    "[ fig : pdos ] , which shows the pdos for the @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 orbitals .    , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 orbitals of a n@xmath1 molecule sitting on a ruthenium slab .",
    "the pdoss are plotted for both the ground state calculation and the resonance calculation .",
    "the grey area indicates energies below the fermi level.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    again it is seen that all the pdoss are shifted up in energy as more charge is placed on the molecule .",
    "almost the entire pdoss are still under the fermi level , but small ripples can be seen above the fermi level , also contributing to the amount of charge going back into the surface .",
    "this backtransfer of charge is not an unwanted effect , since we try to model the long - lived resonance state , ie .",
    "the resonably localized peak in the pdos on fig .",
    "[ fig : dos ] .",
    "the backtransfer of charge is due to some on the energy scale very delocalized bands , indicating a much shorter lifetime , ie .",
    "the backtransfer is expected to happen on a much shorter time scale than the decay of the resonance .",
    "it is however clear from figs .",
    "[ fig : dos ] and [ fig : pdos ] that the charge backtransfer in this case is far from the 0.5 electron indicated by the bader decomposition .",
    "we then conclude that the main part of the discrepancy in this situation can be assigned to the ambiguity in the way charge is assigned to the different atoms .",

    "<S> this comparison shows that the modified @xmath0scf method gives results in close agreement with experiment , significantly closer than the comparable methods . for n@xmath1 adsorbed on ruthenium ( 0001 ) </S>",
    "<S> we map out a 2-dimensional part of the potential energy surfaces in the ground state and the 2@xmath2-resonance . from this </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that an electron hitting the resonance can induce molecular motion , optimally with 1.5 ev transferred to atomic movement . </S>",
    "<S> finally we present some performance test of the @xmath0scf approach on gas - phase n@xmath1 and co , in order to compare the results to higher accuracy methods . here </S>",
    "<S> we find that excitation energies are approximated with accuracy close to that of time - dependent density functional theory . </S>",
    "<S> especially we see very good agreement in the minimum shift of the potential energy surfaces in the excited state compared to the ground state . </S>"
