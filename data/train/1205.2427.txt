    "in solids , the electronic states are described by the bloch wavefunctions with the energy dispersion @xmath5 where @xmath6 being the band index and @xmath7 the crystal momentum .",
    "the velocity of electrons given by @xmath8 is usually much smaller than that of light @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the lorentz invariance is terribly broken and hence many of the beautiful results in quantum electrodynamics ( qed )  @xcite are not applicable to the bloch electrons in solids .",
    "the smallness of the factor @xmath9 naturally leads to the gauge choice ( i.e. , coulomb gauge ) where the scalar potential gives the coulomb interaction without retardation while the electron - electron interaction through the transverse part of the vector potential @xmath10 is often neglected .",
    "the latter is often treated as the external electromagnetic field for the probe of the electromagnetic response of the system .",
    "this gauge choice is regarded as the `` physical gauge . '' for example , one can discuss the physical meaning of the green s function @xmath11 in this gauge where the quasi - particle corresponds its pole structure .",
    "angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) is also formulated in this gauge [ i.e. , arpes intensity is proportional to the electron spectrum function @xmath12  @xcite .    while the nonrelativistic quantum mechanics is basically justified for the electrons in solids , there are some cases where the dirac fermions appear in the electronic band structure .",
    "a representative case is graphene , a two - dimensional sheet of carbon network with hexagonal lattice , where the @xmath13 dirac spectrum near @xmath14 and @xmath15 points describes the low - energy physics  @xcite .",

    "the relativistic spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) rearrange the spin states to yield the `` twist '' of the bloch wavefunctions in the first brillouin zone .",
    "this twist is characterized by the @xmath17 topological integer . in general ,",
    "topological integers can change only discontinuously when the gap closes , which can be described by the local hamiltonian in @xmath18 space .",
    "when the inversion symmetry exists , the effective hamiltonian near this quantum phase transition is the dirac hamiltonian expanded around the time - reversal invariant momentum ( trim ) @xmath19 ( @xmath19 is equivalent to @xmath20 ) . in this case , the orbitals and spins are coupled to form the @xmath16 dirac hamiltonian and the sign change of the mass @xmath21 corresponds to the quantum phase transition between trivial insulator and topological insulator .",
