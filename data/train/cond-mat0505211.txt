    "transport properties of hybrid structures consisting of a superconductor ( s ) multiply connected to several normal metal ( n ) or ferromagnetic ( f ) electrodes has focused an important interest recently@xcite . in usual andreev reflection at a single ns interface , a spin - up",
    "electron coming from the n side is reflected as a hole in the spin - down band while a cooper pair is transferred in the superconductor .",
    "multiterminal structures allow `` non local '' processes , in which a spin - up electron in one electrode is andreev reflected as a hole in the spin - down band in another electrode , corresponding to non local transmission in the electron - hole channel . conversely non local transmission in the electron - electron channel corresponds to a process in which a spin - up electron from one electrode is transmitted as a spin - up electron in another electrode .",
    "transport theory of three - terminal fsf junctions including non local transmission in the electron - electron and electron - hole channels has been discussed recently@xcite , in the tunnel limit@xcite and for highly transparent interfaces@xcite , on the basis of microscopic green s functions@xcite and in the framework of the scattering approach@xcite .",
    "the models were also extended to describe disorder@xcite , non collinear ferromagnets@xcite , and the noise@xcite . on the experimental side ,",
    "two experiments probing non local transport were carried out recently@xcite , in fsf and nsn three - terminal junctions .",

    "[ fig : schema-3d ] ) .",
    "we have already shown that the crossed josephson current vanishes on average in the diffusive limit@xcite , because the andreev reflected hole does not follow the same sequence of impurities as the incoming electron since they propagate in different electrodes . however , by evaluating the statistical fluctuations of the dc crossed josephson current , we show here that the fluctuations of the josephson current decay over the phase coherence length @xmath0 in the ferromagnet , larger than the decay length of the local average josephson current set by the exchange length @xmath1 ( see refs .  ) .",
    "the fluctuations of the crossed supercurrent do not show @xmath2-shift oscillations and damping as a function of the ferromagnet length , because the spin - up and spin - down electrons of correlated pairs extracted from one superconductor do not see the same realization of disorder , so that the center of mass momentum of the spatially separated correlated pair averages to zero after propagation over a length comparable to the elastic mean free path . the root mean square of the crossed josephson current is proportional to the square root of the junction area , because the number of diagrams involved in the supercurrent is equal to the junction area divided by the fermi wave - length .",
