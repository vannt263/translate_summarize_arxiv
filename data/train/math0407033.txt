    "phylogenetic combinatorics_. by `` phylogenetic algebraic geometry '' we mean the study of algebraic varieties which represent statistical models of evolution . for general background reading on phylogenetics",
    "we recommend the books by felsenstein @xcite and semple - steel @xcite .",
    "they provide an excellent introduction to evolutionary trees , from the perspectives of biology , computer science , statistics and mathematics .",
    "they also offer numerous references to relevant papers , in addition to the more recent ones listed below .",
    "phylogenetic algebraic geometry furnishes a rich source of interesting varieties , including familiar ones such as toric varieties , secant varieties and determinantal varieties .",
    "but these are very special cases , and one quickly encounters a cornucopia of new varieties . the objective of this paper is to give an introduction to this subject area , aimed at students and researchers in algebraic geometry , and to suggest some concrete research problems .    the basic object in a phylogenetic model is a tree @xmath0 which is rooted and has @xmath1 labeled leaves .",
    "each node of the tree @xmath0 is a random variable with @xmath2 possible _ states _ ( usually @xmath2 is taken to be @xmath3 , for the binary states @xmath4 , or @xmath5 , for the nucleotides \\{a , c , g , t } ) . at the root , the distribution of the states is given by @xmath6 . on each edge @xmath7 of the tree",
    "there is a @xmath8 transition matrix @xmath9 whose entries are indeterminates representing the probabilities of transition ( away from the root ) between the states .",
    "the random variables at the leaves are _ observed_. the random variables at the interior nodes are _",
    "let @xmath10 be the total number of entries of the matrices @xmath11 and the vector @xmath12 .",
    "these entries are called _",
    "model parameters_. for instance , if @xmath0 is a binary tree with @xmath1 leaves then @xmath0 has @xmath13 edges , and hence @xmath14 . in practice",
    ", there will be many constraints on these parameters , usually expressible in terms of linear equations and inequalities , so the set of statistically meaningful parameters is a polyhedron @xmath15 in @xmath16 .",
    "sometimes , these constraints are given by non - linear polynomials , in which case @xmath15 would be a semi - algebraic subset of @xmath17 . specifying this subset @xmath15 means choosing a _ model of evolution_. several biologically meaningful choices of such models",
    "will be discussed in section [ sec:3 ] .",
    "fix a tree @xmath0 with @xmath1 leaves . at each leaf",
    "we can observe @xmath2 possible states , so there are @xmath18 possible joint observations we can make at the leaves .",
    "the probability @xmath19 of making a particular observation @xmath20 is a polynomial in the model parameters .",
    "hence we get a polynomial map whose coordinates are the polynomials @xmath19 .",
    "this map is denoted    @xmath21 the map @xmath22 depends only on the tree @xmath0 and the number @xmath2 .",
    "what we are interested in is the image @xmath23 of this map . in real - world applications ,",
    "the coordinates @xmath19 represent probabilities , so they should be non - negative and sum to @xmath24 .",
    "in other words , the rules of probability require that @xmath23 lie in the standard @xmath25)-simplex in @xmath26 .",
    "in phylogenetic algebraic geometry we temporarily abandon this requirement .",
    "we keep things simpler and closer to the familiar setting of complex algebraic geometry , by replacing @xmath22 by its complexification @xmath27 , and by replacing @xmath15 and @xmath23 by their zariski closures in @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively .",
    "as we shall see , the polynomials @xmath30 are often homogeneous and @xmath23 is best regarded as a subvariety of a projective space .    in section [ sec:2 ]",
    "we give a basic example of an evolutionary model and put it squarely in an algebraic geometric setting .",
    "this relation is then developed further in section [ sec:3 ] , where we describe the main families of models and show how in special cases they lead to familiar objects like veronese and segre varieties and their secant varieties .",
    "section [ sec:4 ] is concerned with the widely used _",
    "jukes - cantor model _",
    ", which is a toric variety in a suitable coordinate system .",
    "in the last section we formulate a number of general problems in phylogenetic algebraic geometry that we find particularly important , and a list of more specific computationally oriented problems that may shed light on the more general ones .",
    "in this section we explain the polynomial map @xmath22 associated to a tree @xmath0 and an integer @xmath31 . to make things as concrete as possible ,",
    "let @xmath32 and @xmath0 be the tree on @xmath33 leaves pictured below .",
    "[ fig:3 ]    the probability distribution at the root is an unknown vector @xmath34 . for each of the four edges of the tree",
    ", we have a @xmath35-transition matrix :    @xmath36    altogether , we have introduced @xmath37 parameters , each of which represents a probability .",
    "but we regard them as unknown complex numbers .",
    "the unknown @xmath38 represents the probability of observing letter @xmath39 at the root , and the unknown @xmath40 represents the probability that the letter @xmath39 gets changed to the letter @xmath24 along the edge @xmath41 .",
    "all transitions are assumed to be independent events , so the monomial @xmath42 represents the probability of observing the letter @xmath43 at the root , the letter @xmath44 at the interior node , the letter @xmath45 at the leaf @xmath24 , the letter @xmath46 at the leaf @xmath3 , and the letter @xmath2 at the leaf @xmath47 .",
    "now , the probabilities at the root and the interior node are hidden random variables , while the probabilities at the three leaves are observed .",
    "this leads us to consider the polynomial @xmath48 this polynomial represents the probability of observing the letter @xmath45 at the leaf @xmath24 , the letter @xmath46 at the leaf @xmath3 , and the letter @xmath2 at the leaf @xmath47 .",
    "the eight polynomials @xmath49 specify our map @xmath50 in applications , where the parameters are really probabilities , one immediately replaces @xmath51 by a subset @xmath15 , for instance , the nine - dimensional cube in @xmath52 defined by the constraints @xmath53 in phylogenetic algebraic geometry , on the other hand , we allow ourselves the luxury of ignoring inequalities and reality issues .",
    "we regard @xmath22 as a morphism of complex varieties .",
    "the most natural thing to do , for an algebraic geometer , is to work in a projective space .",
    "the polynomials @xmath54 are homogeneous with respect to the different letters @xmath55 and @xmath12 .",
    "we can thus change our perspective and consider our map as a projective morphism @xmath56 this morphism is surjective , and it is an instructive undertaking to examine its fibers .    to underline the points made in the introduction ,",
    "let us now cut down on the number of model parameters and replace the range of the morphism by a natural subset @xmath15 .",
    "for instance , let us define @xmath15 by requiring that the four matrices are identical @xmath57 equivalently , @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the diagonal of @xmath60 .",
    "the restricted morphism @xmath61 is given by the following eight polynomials :    @xmath62    the image of @xmath63 lies in the @xmath64-dimensional projective subspace of @xmath65 defined by @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "it is a hypersurface of degree eight in this @xmath68 .",
    "the defining polynomial of this hypersurface has @xmath69 terms .",
    "studying the geometry of this fourfold is a typical problem of phylogenetic algebraic geometry .",
    "for instance , what is its singular locus ?",
    "the definition of the map @xmath22 for an arbitrary tree @xmath0 with @xmath1 leaves and an arbitrary number @xmath2 of states is a straightforward generalization of the @xmath70 example given above .",
    "it is simply the calculation of the probabilities of independent events along the tree . in general , each coordinate of the map @xmath22 is given by a polynomial of degree equal to the number of edges of @xmath0 plus one .",
    "if the root distribution is not a parameter , the degree of these polynomials is one less .",
    "one staple among the computational techniques for dealing with tree based probabilistic models is the sum - product algorithm .",
    "the sum - product algorithm is essentially a clever application of the distributive law that allows for the fast calculation of the polynomials @xmath19 as well as the derivation of some polynomial relations among these .",
    "the basic idea is to factor the polynomials that represent @xmath19 up the tree .",
    "for instance , in our example above with homogeneous rate matrix : @xmath71 which can be evaluated with 10 multiplications and 3 additions instead of the initial expression which required 16 multiplications and 3 additions . in section [ sec:3 ] , we will show how these factorizations help in identifying polynomial relations among the @xmath19 , i.e. , polynomials vanishing on the image of @xmath22 .",
    "most evolutionary models discussed in the literature have either two or four states for their random variables . the number @xmath1 of leaves ( or _ taxa _ ) can be arbitrary .",
    "computer scientists will often concentrate on asymptotic complexity questions for @xmath72 , while for our purposes it would be quite reasonable to assume that @xmath73 is at most ten .",
    "there are no general restrictions on the underlying tree @xmath0 , but experience has shown that trivalent trees and trees in which every leaf is at the same distance from the root are often simpler .",
    "suppose now that the number @xmath2 of states , the number @xmath1 of taxa and the tree @xmath0 are fixed . the choice of a model is then specified by fixing a subset @xmath74 .",
    "the set @xmath15 comprises the allowed model parameters .",
    "here is a list of commonly studied models :    general markov : :    this is the model @xmath75 . all the transition    matrices @xmath9 are pairwise distinct , and there are no    constraints on the @xmath76 entries of @xmath9 .",
    "the algebraic geometry of this model was studied by allman and rhodes    @xcite .",
    "group based : :    the matrices @xmath9 are pairwise distinct , but they all    have a special structure which makes them simultaneously    diagonalizable by the fourier transform of an abelian _ group_. in    particular , @xmath15 is a linear subspace of    @xmath28 , specified by requiring that some entries    of @xmath11 coincide with some other entries .",
    "for example ,    the _ jukes - cantor model _ for binary states @xmath77    stipulates that all matrices @xmath11 have the form    @xmath78 .",
    "the _ jukes - cantor model _ for dna @xmath79 is the topic of    the next section . for more information on group - based models",
    "see    @xcite .",
    "stationary base composition : :    the matrices @xmath9 are distinct but they all share the    common left eigenvector @xmath6 .",
    "this hypothesis expresses the assumption that the distribution of the    four nucleotides remains the same throughout some evolutionary    process .",
    "an algebraic study of this model appears in @xcite .",
    "reversible : :    the matrices @xmath11 are distinct _",
    "symmetric _ matrices with    the common left eigenvector @xmath80 .",
    "again ,    as before , @xmath15 is a linear subspace of    @xmath28 . commuting : :    the matrices @xmath9 are distinct but they commute    pairwise .",
    "we have not yet seen this model in the biology literature ,    but algebraists love the commuting variety @xcite .",
    "it provides    a natural supermodel for the next one .",
    "substitution : :    the @xmath11 matrices have the form    @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a fixed    matrix .",
    "equivalently , all matrices @xmath11 are powers of a    fixed matrix @xmath83 with constant entries , but    where the exponent @xmath84 is a real parameter .",
    "this is    the most widely used model in biology ( see @xcite ) but for us it has    the disadvantage that it is not an algebraic variety , unless the _ rate    matrix _ @xmath82 has commensurate eigenvalues .",
    "homogeneous : :    the matrices @xmath9 are all equal , or they all belong to    a small finite collection . in this model ,",
    "the number of free    parameters is small and independent of the tree , so the parametric    inference algorithm of @xcite runs in polynomial time .",
    "no hidden nodes : :    when all nodes are observed random variables then the parameterization    becomes monomial , and the model is a toric variety . for the    homogeneous model ,",
    "the combinatorial structure of this variety was    studied in @xcite mixture models : :    suppose we are given @xmath85 trees    @xmath86 ( not necessarily distinct ) on the same    set of taxa .",
    "each tree @xmath87 has its own map    @xmath88 .    the _ mixture model _",
    "is given by the sum of these maps , that is ,    @xmath89 .",
    "for example , the case    @xmath90 and @xmath91 may be    used to model the fact that different regions of the genome evolve at    different rates . see @xcite .",
    "root distribution : :    for any of the above models , the root distribution @xmath12    can be taken to be uniform , @xmath92 , or as    a vector with @xmath2 independent entries .    among these models are many varieties which are familiar in algebraic geometry .",
    "segre varieties : :    these appear as a special case of the model with no hidden nodes .",
    "veronese varieties : :    these appear as a special case of the homogeneous model with no hidden    nodes .",
    "the models in @xcite are natural projections of veronese    varieties .",
    "toric varieties : :    the previous two classes of varieties are toric .",
    "all group - based    models are seen to be toric after a clever linear change of    coordinates .",
    "the toric varieties of some jukes - cantor models will be    discussed in the next section .",
    "grbner bases of binomials for    arbitrary group - based models are given in @xcite .",
    "secant varieties and joins : :    joins appear when taking the mixture models of a collection of models .",
    "the secant varieties of a model amounts to taking the mixture of a    model with itself . a special case of the general markov model includes    the secant varieties to the segre varieties @xcite .",
    "the secant    varieties to veronese varieties @xcite appear as special cases of the    homogeneous models with hidden nodes .",
    "determinantal varieties : :    many of the evolutionary models are naturally embedded in    determinantal varieties , because the tree structure imposes rank    constraints on matrices derived from the probabilities observed at the    leaves .",
    "getting a better understanding of these constraints is    important for both theory and practice @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this section is the discussion of one example which aims to demonstrate that phylogenetic trees arise quite naturally when studying these classical objects of algebraic geometry .",
    "consider the segre embedding of @xmath93 in @xmath94 .",
    "this four - dimensional complex manifold is given by the familiar monomial parameterization @xmath95 its prime ideal is generated by the @xmath96-minors of the following three @xmath97-matrices : @xmath98 these three matrices reflect the following three bracketings of the parameterization : @xmath99 and , of course , these three bracketings correspond to the three binary trees below .",
    "[ fig:3bin ]    let @xmath100 denote the _ first secant variety _ of the segre variety @xmath101 .",
    "thus @xmath100 is the nine - dimensional irreducible subvariety of @xmath102 consisting of all @xmath103-tensors which have tensor rank at most @xmath3 . the secant variety @xmath100 has the parametric representation @xmath104 this shows that the secant variety @xmath100 equals the general markov model for the tree below .",
    "[ fig : claw ]    the prime ideal of @xmath100 is generated by all the @xmath105-minors of the three matrices above .",
    "we write @xmath106 for the variety defined by the @xmath105-minors of the leftmost matrix , @xmath107 for the variety of the @xmath105-minors of the middle matrix , and @xmath108 for the variety of the @xmath105-minors of the rightmost matrix .",
    "then we have , scheme - theoretically , @xmath109 these three varieties are the general markov models for the three binary trees depicted above .",
    "for instance , the determinantal variety @xmath106 equals the general markov model for the binary tree below .        [ fig:4 ]    indeed , the standard parameterization @xmath22 of this model equals @xmath110 this representation shows that the leftmost @xmath97 matrix has rank at most @xmath3 , and , conversely , every @xmath97 matrix of rank @xmath111 can be written like this . we conclude that the general markov model appears naturally when studying secant varieties of segre varieties .",
    "it is instructive to redo the above calculations under the assumption @xmath112 .",
    "then the ambient @xmath102 gets replaced by the four - dimensional space @xmath113 with coordinates @xmath114 under these substitutions , all three @xmath97-matrices reduce to the same @xmath105-matrix @xmath115 the ideal of @xmath96-minors now defines the _ rational normal curve _ of degree four .",
    "this special veronese variety is the small diagonal of the segre variety @xmath116 .",
    "the secant variety of the rational normal curve is the cubic hypersurface in @xmath113 defined by the determinant of the @xmath105 matrix .",
    "hence , unlike ( [ treestrata ] ) , the homogeneous model satisfies @xmath117    studying the stratifications of @xmath118 induced by phylogenetic models , such as ( [ treestrata ] ) and ( [ treestrata2 ] ) , will be one of the open problems to be presented in section [ sec:5 ] .",
    "first , however , let us look at some widely used models which give rise to a nice family of toric varieties .",
    "the jukes - cantor model appears frequently in the computational biology literature and represents a family of toric varieties which have the unusual property that they are not toric varieties in their natural coordinate system .",
    "furthermore , while at first glance they sit naturally inside of @xmath119 , the linear span of these models involve many fewer coordinates . in this section , we will present examples of these phenomena , as well as illustrate some open problems about the underlying varieties .",
    "[ ex : jc3 ] let @xmath0 be the tree with 3 leaves below .",
    "[ fig : jc3 ]    we consider the jukes - cantor dna model of evolution , where each random variable has 4 states ( the nucleotide bases a , c , g , t ) and the root distribution is uniform , i.e. , @xmath120 .",
    "the transition matrices for the jukes - cantor dna model have the form @xmath121 the transition matrices @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 are expressed in the same hankel form as @xmath125 with``@xmath126 '' replaced by @xmath41 , @xmath127 , and @xmath128 respectively . from these matrices and the rooted tree @xmath0 , we get the map @xmath129 where the coordinates of @xmath130 are the possible dna bases at the leaves .",
    "for example , @xmath131 that is , @xmath132 is the probability of observing the triple @xmath133 at the leaves of the tree . since this parameterization is symmetric under renaming the bases , there are many linear relations .",
    "@xmath134 we are left with 5 distinct coordinates . from the practical standpoint ,",
    "one is often interested in the accumulated coordinates , which are given parametrically as follows @xmath135 where @xmath136 and @xmath137 . interpreting these coordinates in terms of the probabilistic model : @xmath138 is the probability of seeing the same base at all three leaves , @xmath139 is the probability of seeing the same base at leaves @xmath45 and @xmath46 and a different base at leaf @xmath2 , and @xmath140 is the probability of seeing distinct bases at the three leaves .    note that the image of @xmath22 is a three dimensional projective variety .",
    "this is a consequence of the uniform root distribution in this model .",
    "the fiber over a generic point is isomorphic to @xmath141 and stems from the fact that it is not possible to individually determine the matrices @xmath125 and @xmath122 .",
    "only the product @xmath142 can be determined .",
    "it is easily computed that the vanishing ideal of this model is generated by one cubic with 19 terms .",
    "remarkably , there exists a linear change of coordinates so that this polynomial becomes a binomial .",
    "thus the corresponding variety is a toric variety in the new coordinates .",
    "this change of coordinates is given by the fourier transform , see @xcite for details .",
    "in these coordinates the parameterization factors : @xmath143 in the fourier coordinates , the cubic with nineteen terms becomes the binomial @xmath144    these fourier coordinates are indexed by the _ subforests _ of the tree , where we define a subforest of a tree to be any subgraph of the tree ( necessarily a forest ) , all of whose leaves are leaves of the original tree .",
    "for instance , the coordinate @xmath145 corresponds to the empty subtree , the coordinate @xmath146 corresponds to the tree from leaf 1 to leaf 3 and not including the edge to leaf 2 , and the coordinate @xmath147 corresponds to the full tree on three leaves . in general",
    "there are @xmath148 fourier coordinates for a tree with @xmath1 leaves , where @xmath149 is the @xmath85-th fibonacci number .",
    "now we consider an example of the jukes - cantor dna model with uniform root distribution on the following tree @xmath0 with 4 leaves .",
    "the variety of this model naturally lives in a @xmath150 dimensional projective space .",
    "however , after noting the symmetry of the parameterization , as in the previous example , there are only @xmath151 coordinates in this model which are distinct . after applying the fourier transform , the parameterization factors into a product , and",
    "hence , the variety is naturally described as a toric variety in @xmath152 . however , there are in fact 2 extra linear relations which are not simply expressed as a simple equality of probabilities so that our variety sits most naturally inside a @xmath153 .",
    "note that @xmath154 , a fibonacci number , as previously mentioned .",
    "we will present the parameterization in these 13 fourier coordinates .    associated to each of the six edges in the tree",
    "is a matrix with two parameters ( @xmath155 and @xmath156 , @xmath157 and @xmath158 , etc . ) as in the previous example .",
    "the fourier transform is a linear change of coordinates not only on the ambient space of the variety , but also on the parameter space .",
    "the new parametric coordinates are given by @xmath159 and so on down the alphabet . to each subforest of the 4 taxa tree @xmath0",
    ", there is a coordinate @xmath160 , where the index @xmath161 is the indicator vector of the edges which appear in the subforest .",
    "the parameterization is given by the following rule @xmath162    the ideal of phylogenetic invariants in the fourier coordinates is generated by polynomials of degrees two and three .",
    "the degree two invariants are given by the @xmath96 determinants of the following matrices : @xmath163 @xmath164 the dimensions of these matrices are also fibonacci numbers .",
    "the rows of these matrices are indexed by the different edge configurations to the left of the root and the columns are indexed by the edge configurations to the right of the root .",
    "there are also cubic invariants which do not have nice determinantal representations .",
    "they come in two types : @xmath165 the only condition on @xmath166 is that each index is actually the indicator function of a subforest of the tree .",
    "the variety of the jukes - cantor model on a 4 taxa tree has dimension 5 , so its secant variety is a proper subvariety in @xmath153 . in applications , the secant varieties of the model are called _ mixture models_. for this model , the secant variety has the expected dimension 11 , and so is a hypersurface .",
    "since the matrix @xmath167 has rank 1 on the original model , it must have rank @xmath3 on the secant variety : thus , the desired hypersurface is the @xmath105 determinant of @xmath167 .",
    "[ ex : jc5 ] now consider the jukes - cantor dna model with uniform root distribution on a binary tree with 5 leaves , as pictured :        as in example  [ ex : jc3 ] , the fourier coordinates ( modulo linear relations ) are given by the subforests of @xmath0 , of which there are 34 . in the fourier coordinates , this ideal is generated by binomials of degree 2 and 3 , of the types we have seen in the previous example .",
    "while the cubic invariants have a relatively simple description , the quadratic invariants are all represented as the @xmath35 determinants of matrices naturally associated to the tree . in particular , tools from numerical linear algebra can be used to determine if these invariants are satisfied .",
    "since the degree 2 invariants are all determinantal , it seems natural to ask what algebraic set these determinantal relations cut out : that is , what is the _ determinantal closure _ of the variety of the jukes - cantor dna model on a five taxa tree ?",
    "the ideal of this determinantal closure is generated by the @xmath96-minors of the four following matrices : @xmath168 @xmath169 @xmath170 @xmath171 surprisingly , this ideal is actually a prime ideal , and so the algebraic set is a toric variety .",
    "it has dimension 10 and degree 501 , whereas this jukes - cantor model has only dimension 7 .",
    "how does the jukes - cantor model sit inside its determinantal closure ?",
    "the main problem in phylogenetic algebraic geometry is to understand the complex variety , i.e. , the complex zariski closure @xmath172 of a phylogenetic model .",
    "this problem has many different reformulations , depending on the point of view of the person posing the problem .",

    "@xcite ) ?    the tropicalization of a variety is the `` logarithmic limit set '' of the points on the complex variety .",
    "tropical geometry is the geometry of the min - plus semi - ring .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the tropical geometry of statistical models plays a crucial role in parametric inference .",
    "how does the tropicalization of a mixture model relate to the tropical mixture of the tropicalization of the model : that is , compare the tropicalization of secant varieties and joins to the secant varieties and joins of tropicalizations , see @xcite .    in practice ,",
    "it has proven to be difficult to find a full set of generators of the ideal of @xmath173 , therefore , we suggest certain subsets of the ideal that may be enough to distinguish between different models ( as problem  [ two ] asks ) .",
    "we think of these subsets as types of closure operation , for example , @xmath173 is the zariski closure ( over @xmath175 ) of @xmath176 .",
