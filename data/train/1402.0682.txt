    ". in particular , numerical simulations of collisionless cold dark matter ( dm ) describe the gravitational growth of infinitesimal primordial density perturbations , probed by the cosmic microwave background anisotropies , that lead to the formation of the present - day large - scale structure of the universe .",
    "these simulations provide us with a number of predictions about the structure of cold dm halos and their basic properties  ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "although the standard cosmological model has proven to be highly successful in explaining the observed large - scale structure of the universe , it has been less successful on smaller scales .",
    "recent data on low mass galaxies suggests that the inferred subhalo dm distributions have almost flat cores  ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in contradiction with the cuspy profile distributions predicted by numerical simulations  ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and that sub halo numbers are overpredicted at both low mass and intermediate masses  ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and massive dwarf galaxy scales  ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "some of the issues associated with dwarf galaxies can be addressed if the dm is more `` collisional '' ( with baryons ) than currently considered in numerical simulations .",
    "this hypothesis favors constant - density cores with lower central densities than those coming from cold dm models , such as self interacting dm  ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , the closeness between @xmath4 and @xmath5 , usually referred as cosmic coincidence , may suggest a profound link between the dark and the ordinary sectors . indeed , although the two sectors have different macroscopic properties , the total amount of dm observed today could be produced in the early universe by a mechanism identical to baryogenesis , and therefore an asymmetry between dm particles and their antiparticles would be expected .",
    "a detailed account of current progress in asymmetric dm studies can be found in the literature  ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "all of these cosmological facts may suggest that dark and ordinary matter may have more properties in common than expected . in view of this",
    ", it is tantalizing to imagine that the dark world could be similarly complex ( cp violating and asymmetric ) and full of forces that are invisible to us ( hidden parallel sector or mirror world ) .",
    "the history of the early mirror universe has been studied in ref .",

    "@xcite .    more specifically , since in our sector only long  range electromagnetic force and gravity affect the dynamical evolution of virialized astrophysical objects , the physics of a complex dark sector in which the matter fields are charged under an extra @xmath0 gauge group is particularly interesting to study . indeed ,",
    "if the mass of the new gauge boson ( dark photon ) is smaller that the typical momenta exchanged in the scattering , the phenomenology of the dark world can in itself be as complicated as that of our sector ( e.g. dark electromagnetism with quite large self - interactions ) , providing at the same time also a feeble long - range interaction between the two worlds ( thanks to the kinetic mixing of the new @xmath0 gauge boson with the photon ) .",
    "this implies in general that the dark world is more collisional than the standard cold dm , and therefore some of the previously mentioned problems can probably be solved  ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , since a long - range dm - nucleus interaction is enhanced for small momentum exchanges , this class of models can also relax the tension between the positive results of direct detection experiments ( the annual modulation observed by dama  @xcite and cogent  @xcite , and the hints of an observed excess of events on cresst  @xcite and cdms - si  @xcite ) , and the constraints coming from null results ( e.g.  cdms - ge  @xcite , xenon100  @xcite and very recently lux  @xcite ) .",

    "the helioseismic data that we use was obtained by several international collaborations , such as the solar and heliospheric observatory ( soho ) mission and the birmingham solar oscillations network ( bison ) observational network  @xcite .",

    "one often assumes a symmetric dark sector in which the dm scattering off of baryon nuclei is done by a contact - like interaction . in our study , we will instead focus on a class of asymmetric dm models in which the interaction between dm particles and target nuclei is mediated by a light messenger .",
    "if the typical momenta exchanged in the scattering is bigger than the mass of the mediator , a long  range interaction then arises .    a specific realization of this kind of picture is offered by particle physics models where a new @xmath0 hidden gauge boson @xmath11 ( dark photon ) possesses a small kinetic mixing @xmath12 with the photon .",
    "in this case , the interaction between a nucleus with mass @xmath13 and electric charge @xmath14 ( @xmath15 is the number of protons in the baryon nucleus and @xmath16 the electrical charge ) and a dm particle with mass @xmath17 and dark charge @xmath18 ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the equivalent quantities of @xmath15 and @xmath16 in the dark sector ) is described in the non - relativistic limit by the following yukawa potential  ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the electromagnetic fine structure constant and the parameter @xmath23 measures the strength of the dm - dark photon coupling . here",
    "@xmath24 is the mass of the dark photon that acts like an electronic cloud which screens the charges of the particles involved in the scattering . since both @xmath25 and @xmath12 are unknown , we define @xmath26 and we treat it as a free parameter of our model together with @xmath17 and @xmath24 . before moving on",
    "we have however verify whether the symmetric component of @xmath27 in the dark sector is annihilated away or not .",
    "in general , since for this simple model the dominant annihilation channel is given by @xmath28 , we can put a lower bound on the parameter @xmath25 by demanding that the annihilation cross section into dark photons ( @xmath29 ) is bigger than the thermal one ( @xmath30 pb ) . in agreement with refs .",
    "@xcite , this condition requires @xmath31 , where @xmath32 .",
    "we shall come back to this point at the end of sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] because for this kind of models the dm - dm scattering can plays an important role in the capture rate and in the energy transport by dm particles in the sun .",
    "the differential cross section , neglecting the form factor of the target nuclei , can be simply obtained by performing the fourier transform of eq .",
    "[ vr ] and it reads @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the dm - nucleus reduced mass and @xmath36 is the momenta exchanged in the interaction with @xmath37 the recoil energy . as is apparent from the dependence on the dark photon mass ,",
    "two different regimes clearly appear :    * _ point  like limit _",
    "( @xmath38 ) : in this regime the interaction is of a contact type .",
    "indeed the differential cross section turns out to be proportional to @xmath39 which plays the same role as fermi s constant in weak interactions .",
    "the interaction reduces to the `` standard '' spin - independent picture , apart from the fact that in this case , dm particles only couple with protons ( @xmath40 ) . *",
    "_ long  range limit _ ( @xmath41 ) : in this regime , the differential cross section acquires an explicit dependence on the momenta exchanged in the interaction and therefore a rutherford - like cross section arises ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "this is extremely interesting because ideal experiments with very low energy threshold and light target nuclei ( e.g.  the sun ) are in principle more sensitive than the ones with high threshold and heavy targets ( e.g.  xenon100  and lux ) . to give a concrete example ,",
    "once dm particles are thermalized with baryons in the center of the sun , their collisions occur with @xmath43 mev considering a dm mass of 10 gev . for direct detection experiments ,",
    "the typical momenta transferred in the scattering is instead bigger ( @xmath44 mev ) . thanks to this fact , we expect that dm models feature a long - range interaction with ordinary matter can affect the sound - speed radial profile of the sun without being excluded by terrestrial experiments .",
    "having the differential cross section at our disposal , we assume that the normalization of both the capture rate and the transport of energy by dm particles in the sun is controlled by the energy transfer cross section obtained by weighting eq .   with ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "this is of course a good estimator for the transport mechanism , while for the capture process the introduction of the same cross section is justified because the sun s escape velocity @xmath46 is much bigger than both the thermal velocity of baryons in the sun and the typical dispersion velocity of the dm particles in the halo @xmath47 .",
    "in particular , we have checked that the error in the total rate is negligible , if we replace the total cross section in the rate per unit time @xmath48 given e.g. in eq .",
    "7 of  @xcite , with the energy transfer cross section computed for @xmath49 . in the born approximation ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",

    "unlike the customary dm models , in this case @xmath55 depends on @xmath54 in the long  range regime .",
    "thanks to this main novelty , one therefore expects that the typical scattering cross section in the capture process differs compared to the one entering in the transport mechanism . on a more specific level , one has :    _ capture : _ in general , the infalling dm particles reach a given shell of radius @xmath56 with a velocity @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the dm velocity at infinity with respect to the sun s rest frame",
    ". since both the thermal velocity of baryons in the sun and the dispersion velocity of dm particles in the halo are much smaller than @xmath59 , we can assume as commented upon above that the relative velocity @xmath60 .",
    "furthermore , since the total number of dm particles captured by the sun is independent on @xmath56 , it is a good approximation to define an average infalling dm velocity by @xmath61 here @xmath62 is the sun s mass density , @xmath63 kg is its total mass and @xmath64 cm is its radius . as explained in more detail in the next section , the capture rate",
    "is then computed numerically considering a constant cross section @xmath65 .",
    "_ transport : _ in this case , the typical relative velocity for the scattering is much smaller than @xmath66 being due to dm particles thermalized together with the ordinary plasma in the center of the sun .",
    "it is then a good approximation to assume @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the thermal speed and @xmath69 is the time - dependent temperature in the sun s core .",
    "as explained in more detail in the next section , we compute the transport of energy numerically by considering @xmath70 .",
    "it is worth stressing that since the solar code follows the time evolution of the sun , in the early stages the energy transport , and in turn the thermal conduction by dm particles , was much more efficient with @xmath69 at that time being smaller than the present - day central temperature .    in this study , we focus on the interaction of dm with hydrogen ",
    "the most abundant chemical element in the sun s interior .",
    "[ fig:1 ] shows an illustrative example of the dm - hydrogen energy transfer cross section @xmath55 as a function of the mass of the dark photon @xmath24 for a fixed value of the kinetic mixing parameter @xmath6 and a dm mass @xmath7 gev . on a more specific level",
    "we show in blue the scattering cross section responsible for the capture process",
    "@xmath8 , while in red is shown the one entering into the energy transport mechanism @xmath9 computed at the present time ( @xmath10 k ) .",
    "we can see that if the mass of the dark photon is smaller than a few mev ( long  range regime ) , the capture and the transport processes are controlled by different scattering cross sections .",
    "it is worth pointing out that in this limit , the ratio @xmath71 is barely dependent on @xmath24 , if @xmath17 is larger than the hydrogen mass .",
    "it instead depends on the mass of the dm particle through the thermal velocity relation and in particular for a 10 gev candidate , @xmath72 .",
    "the main new aspect is actually given by this enhanced conduction in the inner part of the sun compared to the usual dm models .",
    "thanks indeed to this fact , dm particles , interacting via long - range forces with ordinary matter , can produce an impact on the helioseisomology data without evading the constraints coming from direct dm search experiments .    in our analysis",
    ", we consider the observed sound speed radial profile of the sun and compare it to the theoretical prediction over a broad range of dm masses ( 4 gev@xmath73 20 gev ) , dark photon masses ( 0.1 kev @xmath74 1 gev ) and therefore our results can also be extended for lighter mediators . ] and kinetic mixing parameters ( @xmath75 ) .",

    "the sun , as are all stars in the milky way , is immersed in a halo of dm . as with any other star in the galaxy ,",
    "the sun captures substantial numbers of dm particles during its evolution , but any impact on the star depends on the properties of these particles , as well as on the stellar dynamics and structure of the star . in general , for low - mass stars evolving in low density dm halos , the presence of dm inside the star changes its evolution by providing the star with a new mechanism to evacuate the heat produced in the stellar core  ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is quite different for stars evolving in dm halos of high density  as occurs during the formation of the first generation of stars . in these cases , the annihilation of dm particles supplies the star with an additional source of energy capable of substantially extending the lifetimes of these stars  @xcite .",
    "the computation of the impact of dm in the evolution of the sun is done by a modified version of the cesam code  , which has been widely used to compute the ssm and for modelling other stars by different research groups  . in this study , we follow a procedure identical to other studies published in the literature by some of us as well as other authors  ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , there are some important differences between this study and the previous ones , which we will highlight in the remainder of this section .",
    "as commented upon in the previous section , the impact of dm in the sun s interior depends on two major physical processes : the accumulation of dm inside the star , and the efficiency of dm in transferring energy from the core to the external layers . in any case",
    ", the density of dm in the halo is the single major ingredient affecting the impact of dm in the sun .",
    "as usually done in these studies , we consider that the local density of dm is @xmath97  @xcite .",
    "the choice of this value is in part made to facilitate the comparison with other work .",
    "still , this is a very reliable value : the most recent estimates of @xmath98 made by two independent groups have obtained values of @xmath99  @xcite and @xmath100  @xcite . in particular",
    "@xcite argue that their new method is quite robust , and they have obtained their value at 90% confidence level . in our computation , we will also consider that the dm particles in the solar neighborhood have dispersion velocity @xmath101  ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the accumulation of dm in the sun s core during its evolution from the beginning of the zams until the present age ( @xmath102 ) is regulated by three physical processes : capture , annihilation and evaporation of dm particles . at each step of the evolution ,",
    "the total number of dm particles @xmath103 , that is captured by the star is given by @xmath104 where @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 refer to the dm capture , self - capture , annihilation and evaporation rates respectively .",
    "it is worth noticing that , unlike previous studies , in this work we resolve numerically the equation ( [ eq - n ] ) for each step of the star s evolution .",
    "a detailed discussion about these processes can be found in the literature  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the capture rate @xmath105 is computed numerically from the expression obtained by  @xcite as implemented by  @xcite .",
    "the scattering of dm particles with the baryons inside the sun is the main factor affecting the capture rate @xmath105 .",
    "we restrict our study to the scattering of dm particles to the most abundant element , i.e. , hydrogen .",
    "we consider that the capture rate is controlled by @xmath8 obtained by substituting @xmath54 with the averaged infalling speed @xmath66 in eq .",
    "( [ eq - sigma ] ) as briefly explained in the previous section .",
    "in particular , in the long - range regime ( @xmath109 or in terms of the exchanged momenta , @xmath41 ) , the dm - hydrogen energy transfer cross section responsible for the capture process is independent of @xmath17 and logarithmically dependent on @xmath24 .",
    "it reads @xmath110 where @xmath111 is a sort of coulomb logarithm that measures the strength of the screening effect in the capture process and @xmath112 is its value for @xmath113 kev .",
    "the other chemical elements are under - abundant , consequently their contribution for the capture of dm is negligible .",
    "the dependence of the scattering cross - section on the parameter space of long - range dm particles is given by equation  ( [ eq - sigma ] ) .",
    "the description of how this capture process is implemented in our code is discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the evaporation rate @xmath108 is relevant only for very light particles , i.e. , particles with @xmath114  @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimated the evaporation mass for dm particles in the sun , @xmath115 , to be such that @xmath116 .",
    "if @xmath117 the dm particle escapes the solar gravitational field and consequently has no impact on the structure of the star .",
    "@xcite also found that the evaporation of dm particles is completely irrelevant for @xmath118 .",
    "it is worth noticing the fact that because the evaporation boundary has a exponential dependency on the mass and the scattering cross - section of the dm particle  @xcite , it follows that if @xmath17 exceeds @xmath115 by a few percent , then the evaporation of dm particles is totally negligible .",
    "furthermore it is also important to point out that our dm model can easily have a quite large self  interaction in the long  range regime with size similar to the electromagnetic scattering . if then this self  interaction is attractive ( e.g. this can be obtained if the dark sector is composed by light and heavy species with a different sign of the dark charge @xmath18 ) we expect that @xmath108 can be set to zero for dm masses below 4 gev as well , in such cases the properties of the dark plasma being similar to the ordinary one ( electrons are indeed trapped in the sun ) .",
    "we leave further discussion of this important effect for future studies .    in our computation , we use @xmath108 estimated by  @xcite in the regime where the sun is optically thin with respect to the dm particles .",
    "nevertheless , we restrict our analysis to particles with mass larger than @xmath119 , for which the evaporation rate is almost negligible .    once gravitationally captured by the star ,",
    "the dm particles thermalise with baryons after a few kepler orbits around the solar centre , colliding through elastic scattering with hydrogen and other elements , and thus providing the star with an alternative mechanism for the transport of energy .",
    "the relatively efficiency of the dm energy transport in relation to the radiative heat transport depends on the knudsen number , @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the free mean path of the dm particle inside the star and @xmath122 is the characteristic radius of the dm distribution  @xcite given by @xmath123 where @xmath124 gev/@xmath125 is the today s density of the sun s core .",
    "depending on the value of @xmath126 , the transport of energy by dm is local ( conductive ) or non - local , which corresponds to @xmath127 or @xmath128 . in the conductive regime",
    "the effective luminosity carried by dm particles is proportional to @xmath129 , while in the non - local one to @xmath130 .",
    "the maximal luminosity is instead achieved when @xmath131 ( see e.g. fig .",
    "11 of @xcite ) . here",
    "@xmath132 is the number density of dm particles captured in the sun which is given by @xmath133 $ ] where @xmath134 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we assume that the thermal conduction by dm particles is controlled by @xmath9 obtained by substituting @xmath54 with the thermal speed @xmath135 in eq .",
    "( [ eq - sigma ] ) as briefly explained in the previous section . unlike the cross section responsible for the capture process , in the long  range",
    "limit @xmath9 depends on the dm mass via the thermal velocity @xmath135 .",
    "it explicitly reads @xmath136 where @xmath137 emulates the screening effect in the energy transport and @xmath138 is its value for @xmath113 kev , @xmath7 gev and @xmath139 .",
    "once computed the energy transfer cross section the average mean free path in the long - range regime , can be estimated as @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the average number density of baryons in the sun and @xmath142 .",
    "depending on the free parameters of the model scanned in our analysis , the energy transfer cross section covers a broad range of values ( @xmath143 ) . in this case the corresponding range of the knudsen number is ( @xmath144 ) .",
    "both mechanisms of energy transport are considered in this study  @xcite . in the case of the non - local regime , we follow the numerical prescription of  @xcite rather than the original one proposed by  @xcite .    we note that in the long - range limit , a rutherford - like dm - baryon interaction can significantly enhance the energy transport ( @xmath145 ) compared to the usual picture ( for the standard spin - independent and spin - dependent cases , one always has @xmath146 ) . indeed ,",
    "even if the capture cross section is around @xmath147 @xmath83 ( this choice correspond to @xmath148 ) , the dm particles can have a mean free path around @xmath149 , providing then the maximum luminosity carried by dm particles . for the standard contact interaction and for the same cross section , the mean free path is much longer and therefore the luminosity is reduced being in this case the transport non - local .",
    "this is the main new element , and in particular , as we will see in sec .",
    "[ cconstraints ] , this class of models with enhanced energy transport can solve the so - called solar abundance problem without being excluded by direct searches experiments .",
    "a similar conclusion can also be found in ref .",
    "in particular they implement the formalism of  @xcite in order to properly account for both velocity and exchanged momenta dependencies in the differential cross section . although their method is more refined compare to the one we are using they did not incorporate their results in a solar simulation software yet .",
    "the impact of dm in the sun is studied by inferring the modifications that dm causes to the sun s structure and to the solar observables . in the following , the standard solar model  ( ssm",

    "* ) is used as our model of reference , which predicts solar neutrino fluxes and helioseismology data consistent with current measurements . the excellent agreement obtained between theory and observation results from the combined effort between the fields of helioseismolgy and solar modelling , a collaboration extended by several decades which lead to a high precision description of physical processes present inside the sun  @xcite .",
    "this was very relevant in the case of the physical processes related with microscopic physics , including the equation of state , opacities , nuclear reactions rates , and microscopic diffusion of helium and heavy elements .",

    "[ fig:2 ] we compare the sound speed profile of ssm with the sound speed computed by an inversion technique from helioseismology data  @xcite .",
    "the green square dots correspond to the relative sound speed difference @xmath150 , where @xmath151 and @xmath96 are the sound speed from ssm and helioseismic data .",
    "@xmath152 is smaller than 2% throughout the solar interior , above 20% and below 90% of the sun s radius .",
    "although agreement between @xmath151 and @xmath96 is very good , a discrepancy remains between the present ssm and helioseismic data , from which there is no obvious solution  @xcite .",
    "it is worth noticing that the quality of the sound speed inversion is highly reliable , as most of the helioseismic data has a relative precision of measurements larger than @xmath153 .",
    "contrarily , in the sun s inner core below @xmath154 , the seismology data available is quite sparse and consequently the sound speed inversion is less reliable ( cf .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "as pointed out by  @xcite the inversion of the sound speed profile in the sun s inner core is limited by the low number acoustic frequencies measured ( see table 1 in  @xcite and references therein ) , as well as by the weak sensitivity of the eigenfunctions of global acoustic modes to the structure of the sun s core .",
    "this difficulty can only be overcome with the positive detection of gravity modes .",
    "equally , in the most external layers of the sun , the inversion of the sound speed profile is not possible , mainly due to the fact that the inversion technique breaks down ( acoustic oscillations are no - longer adiabatic ) , as a complex interaction occurs between convection , magnetic fields and acoustic oscillations  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , for the purpose of this study , we choose to consider the theory - observation uncertainty to be of the order of 4% rather than 2% . in the remainder of the article we will refer to this value as the _ ssm uncertainty _ , meaning the undistinguished uncertainty related to the physical processes of the ssm or helioseismogy sound speed inversion .",
    "the dmlri solar models were obtained in an identical manner to the ssm , by adjusting the initial helium @xmath155 and the mixing length parameter @xmath156 in such a way that at the present age ( @xmath157 ) , these solar models reproduced the observed values of the mass , radius and luminosity of the sun , as well as the observed photospheric abundance ratio @xmath158 , where @xmath159 and @xmath15 are the mass fraction of hydrogen and the mass fraction of elements heavier than helium , respectively .",

    "[ fig:2 ] is the fact that there are some dmlri solar models that can resolve the current discrepancy with helioseismology data , as @xmath162 reproduces the observed discrepancy @xmath163 .    in dmlri models ,",
    "the dm impact is most visible in the core of the star where the dm particles accumulate .",
    "however , because the solar models are required to have the current observed values of radius and luminosity , a decrease of the production of nuclear energy in the sun s core due to the reduction of the central temperature ( caused by the thermalisation of dm with baryons ) , is compensated by an increase of the sound speed in the radiative region . in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] we show an illustrative dmgri solar model with benchmark parameters : @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath6 ( _ black curve _ ) . moreover , all the dmlri solar models have an identical impact behaviour on the solar structure , however , based upon the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath24 it is possible to distinguish three sets of models : @xmath164 dmlri models for which the squared sound speed difference is larger than the _ ssm uncertainty _ ( _ red curves _ ) ; @xmath165 dmlri models for which the agreement with the helioseismic data is better than the current ssm ( _ green curves _ ) ; @xmath166 dmlri models for which the squared sound speed difference is smaller than the _",
    "ssm uncertainty _",
    "( _ blue curves _ ) .",
    "although , there is a large set of dmlri models ( _ red _ and _ green curves _ ) for which @xmath162 tends to agree @xmath163 , as for those models for which the central value of @xmath161 varies more than @xmath167 , the central temperature will change for an identical amount .",
    "consequently , the solar neutrino fluxes of these models become strongly in disagreement with the current neutrino flux observations  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , we make the conservative option in this preliminary study to only consider models for which the central temperature does not change very much from the ssm ( _ green curves _ dmlri models ) .    fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] shows the maximum sound speed difference @xmath168}$ ] in the full parameter space of dmlri models ( @xmath169 ) once the constraint @xmath170 is imposed .",
    "the represented percentages are performed for @xmath171 . on a more specific level in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] we project the parameter space in the ( @xmath172 ) plane by choosing @xmath113 kev . in the central plane",
    "the ( @xmath173 ) plane is shown for @xmath7 gev , while on the left panel , the parameter space is projected in the ( @xmath174 ) plane keeping fix @xmath175 . once @xmath176 is larger than the _ ssm uncertainty _",
    "it is reasonable to exclude all dmlri models , since they produce a large impact on the sun s core sound speed profile ( _ red regions _ ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath176 is in the range @xmath177 the agreement with the helioseismic data , as commented upon above , is improved ( _ green regions _ ) .",
    "for instance , we find that dm particles with a mass in the range 4 gev8.5 gev coupled with ordinary baryons via a kinetic mixing parameter @xmath12 bigger than @xmath178 , produce a very large impact on the sun s core in the long  range regime ( @xmath24 smaller than a few mev )",
    ". therefore they can be excluded as possible dm candidates . on the other hand , we can see that dm particles with a mass of the order of @xmath179 , a kinetic mixing parameter @xmath180 and a mediator with a mass smaller than a few mev improve the agreement between the best solar model and the helioseismic data .",
    "this is quite interesting since direct dm searches experiments , as we shall see in the next section , either do not , or barely exclude , these kinds of dm models with long  range interactions with baryons .",
    "furthermore , it is worth noticing that for very light dark photon ( @xmath24 smaller than few kev ) , and for @xmath181 the transport occurs in the conductive regime . in this case , as we can see in the figure , our results are independent on @xmath24 , because the effective luminosity carried by dm particles in the conductive regime is proportional to @xmath182 .",
    "this is important because , as we will see in the next section , the complementary constraints coming from supernova observations and astrophysical or cosmological arguments are very week for very light mediators .",
    "in this section , we present the complementary constraints which are relevant for dmlri models .",
    "a first class of them come from terrestrial direct detection experiments . in particular , since the interactions considered in our work is spin - independent , we only compute the constraints coming from the xenon100   and lux  experiments .",
    "the statistical analysis used to treat the datasets can be found in @xcite where the authors have provided a complete sets of numerical tools for deriving the bounds in direct searches in a completely model independent way . without entering in the details of this work we can compute the bounds in the relevant parameter space of our model following the main steps summarized in sec .  6 of @xcite .",
    "in particular , as pointed out in the first three steps ( 1a-1c ) , we have to identify the non - relativistic operator and its coefficient associated with a yukawa - type interaction given in eq .  .",
    "since this interaction is spin independent the operator is simply the identity , while the non - relativistic coefficient is given by @xmath183 ( see e.g.  @xcite for details ) .",
    "thanks now to ready - made scaling functions provided in the webpage of @xcite , the bounds on the parameter space of our model can be obtained by following the last two steps ( 2a-2b ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] we show the constraints in the relevant parameter spaces of our model .",
    "as we did in the previous section , we project the parameter space in the ( @xmath184 ) plane ( left panel ) , ( @xmath185 ) plane ( central panel ) and ( @xmath174 ) plane ( right panel ) .",
    "the dark blue ( red ) lines refer to the constraints coming from xenon100(lux ) , while the different hatching ( dotted , dashed - dotted , dashed ) indicates the three values of the third direction in the parameter space that we kept fixed ( @xmath186(1 , 0.1 , @xmath187 0.01 ) gev on the left panel , @xmath188(6 , 10 , 14 ) gev on the central panel and @xmath189 on the right panel ) .",
    "the areas of the parameter space above the first and second plots , and the ones below the third plot are excluded .",
    "similar constraints can also be found in ref .",
    "we can see that in the long  range regime ( mediator masses below roughly 10 mev ) , the constraints becomes independent of @xmath24 . indeed in this case , the interaction is rutherford - like and therefore the differential cross section in eq .  , which sets the normalization of the total number of events in certain experiments , solely depends on the exchanged momentum @xmath190 .",
    "by virtue of this fact , we can just use the left plot of fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] and compare it directly with the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "we can see that in the relevant dm mass range that affects helioseismic data ( 420 ) gev , the constraints , coming from the lux  experiments , exclude dmlri models that are coupled with baryons through kinetic mixing parameters larger than roughly ( @xmath191 ) .",
    "therefore , as is apparent , long - range spin - independent dm - baryon interactions can easily improve the agreement between the best solar model and the helioseismic data without being excluded by direct detection experiments for dm masses in the range ( 4 - 12 ) gev .",
    "indeed , as we have already pointed out , the sun is an ideal experiments for dm models which posses an enhanced cross section with baryons for small momentum exchanges .",
    "a third class of constraints which instead solely depend on the characteristics on the dark sector itself are those coming from self  interactions . indeed , since for this type of model , the dm - dm scattering is not suppressed by @xmath12 , the self ",
    "interactions , especially in the long  range limit , can easily reach large values , affecting the dynamics of virialized astrophysical objects . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the constraints on @xmath24 coming from the observations of a few elliptical dm halos have been presented .",
    "these constraints are in general very stringent for dm masses below 10 gev : in this case , in fact , the time over which energy is transferred in the system is extremely rapid and therefore a spherical dm halo tends to form in contradiction with observations . in particular , dark photon masses below roughly 100 mev are excluded",
    ". however , the derivation of this last class of constraints is very uncertain , both from the theoretical and experimental side , because we do not really know how virialized astrophysical objects are formed in the presence of a dm sector with long  range interactions . indeed , since the self - interaction needed to change their dynamics is in general of the order of the thompson scattering ( @xmath192 @xmath83 ) , from trivial dimensional analysis of such large cross sections , the following rough estimate yields that the self - interaction is of a long  range type in most of the virialized astrophysical objects under the assumption that the dm - dark photon coupling is of the order of @xmath193 . in this case",
    ", the probability to radiate a dark photon in the scattering process is different from zero and therefore it might well be possible that the dm sector is dissipative just like our sector .",
    "the time over which energy is transferred in the system is no longer a good indicator , since the relevant quantity that describes the dynamical evolution of the system is now the cooling time : in particular , for a dm sector composed of heavy and light species , the dissipation time due to the soft emission of dark photons ( dark bremsstrahlung ) can be smaller than the age of the virialized astrophysical objects ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case",
    ", the system is no longer stable and in general it starts to collapse . by virtue of this fact",
    ", we do not consider this last class of constraints , since a more dedicated and careful analysis also involving numerical simulations is clearly needed .",
    "we have examined how dm - baryon long  range interactions can affect the sun s sound speed radial profile . the phenomenological approach used in our analysis lets us explore all the parameter space from the contact regime to the long - range regime .",
    "we find that dm particles lighter than 8.5 gev coupled with ordinary baryons through a kinetic mixing parameter @xmath194 bigger than @xmath178 , produce a very large impact on the sun s core in the long  range regime ( @xmath24 smaller than few mev ) .",
    "therefore they can be excluded as possible dm candidates . however , solar models for which the dm particle has a mass of @xmath179 and the mediator a mass smaller than @xmath195 improve the agreement with helioseismic data . nevertheless , when the mass of the dark photon is larger than @xmath196 the impact on the sun s structure is very small , being in this case the interaction of a contact - type ( standard spin - independent picture ) .",
    "in particular , the results obtained here reveal that dm models featuring a long - range interaction with ordinary matter can affect the sound - speed radial profile and in turn probably solve the so - called solar abundance problem without being excluded by terrestrial experiments ( e.g. lux  and xenon100 ) in which the scattering cross section is suppressed by the strong inverse dependence on @xmath190 .",
    "the sun is in fact an ideal dm detector for the type of particle considered here , since it measures the entire nuclear recoil energy spectra in the scatterings .    to summarize , in this work we have obtained two main results .",
    "firstly , for the first time , a dm - baryon velocity dependent total cross - section has been implemented in solar simulation software .",
    "secondly , but even more importantly , our analysis shows that dm particles with a mass of 10 gev and a long  range interaction with ordinary matter mediated by a very light mediator ( below roughly a few mev ) , can have an impact on the sun s sound speed profile without violating the constraints coming from direct dm searches .",
    "our results are valid if the parameter @xmath25 which controls the self - interaction is of the order of @xmath197 .",
    "larger values of this parameter , as we have shown in the last paragraph of sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] , can dramatically reduced the effective luminosity carried by dm particles in the sun and therefore our results can not be applied in that case . furthermore , as commented upon in sec .",
    "[ cconstraints ] , it might well be possible that a dark sector with long  range forces can dissipate a relevant amount of energy through the emission of dark photons .",
    "a dissipative dark sector is extremely interesting because it can offer a rich array of new ideas ranging from the detection of primordial dark radiation to new possibilities for dm dynamics in virialized astrophysical objects .",
