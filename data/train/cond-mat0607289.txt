    "the renormalization group ( rg ) method provides a way to attack , and in many cases solve , the infrared problem of models in field theory , statistical mechanics and many  body theory .",
    "infrared problems are ubiquitous and physically natural , since they are inherent to systems with gapless excitations , such as critical systems of statistical mechanics , massless field theories , and systems with spontaneously broken continuous symmetries .    in systems of correlated fermions modelling metals , excitations around the fermi surface",
    "are gapless .",
    "the attempt to treat interaction effects by naive perturbation theory leads to a severe infrared problem in the form of divergences due to small denominators .",
    "the rg has been used for weak , short  range two  body interactions to cure this problem in perturbation theory and to classify the interaction terms by their power counting degree @xcite .",
    "the one  body ( or self  energy ) terms , quadratic in the fermion fields , are the relevant ones , followed by the marginally relevant parts of the two  body interaction , which are quartic in the fermion fields .",
    "all higher terms are power counting irrelevant at weak coupling .",
    "energy terms change the fermi surface , which is the location of the singularity of the fermion propagator . because the singularity has to be kept track of precisely",
    ", neglecting these terms leads to problems even in formal perturbation theory ( provided it is done to higher than second order ) . for this reason , the self ",
    "energy terms are the most relevant ones .",
    "the marginally relevant parts of the two  body terms determine the quasiparticle interactions and give information about ordering tendencies and collective phenomena .",
    "the hierarchy of equations couples the evolution of the different terms .    by the above arguments , a possible way to proceed is to assume that the fermi surface given by the free propagator is already that of the interacting system .",
    "one can then take the dispersion function of a certain form , hence the interacting fermi surface of a certain shape , assuming that this can be realized in an interacting system , and treat the remaining selfenergy effects by keeping them in the form of two  legged vertices .",
    "this also involves the assumption that there is no large correction to the quasiparticle weight .",
    "both assumptions can , with considerable technical effort , be verified for the situation of smooth , positively curved fermi surfaces @xcite .",
    "technically , this is done in @xcite using counterterms to fix the fermi surface .",
    "the counterterm function determines the shift from the fermi surface of the free to that of the interacting system .",
    "the above realizability question takes the form of an inversion problem , which is solved under certain conditions in @xcite .",
    "although the importance of the self  energy terms is known and clearly acknowledged in the literature , a way to proceed in applied studies has been to focus on the study of the two  body interactions while neglecting self  energy terms in the flow .",
    "the main motivation for this is simplicity . controlling the relevant selfenergy terms",
    "carefully is technically complicated already in the case of a smooth fermi surface .",
    "the counterterm method of @xcite provides a conceptually clear way of dealing with the problem , but it has been used only in a few applied studies so far .    in the two  dimensional hubbard model ,",
    "the case with van hove singularities is of interest for high-@xmath0 superconductivity @xcite . for this case , a renormalized expansion using counterterms",
    "is developed , and some regularity properties of the self  energy are shown , in @xcite .",
    "however , the question of realizability of singular fermi surface shapes has not been fully answered yet , although it is very important for deciding how generic van hove singularities really are in two  dimensional interacting systems @xcite .",
    "the effects of fermi surface dynamics near van hove points can be rather nontrivial , since the fermi surface is most easily moved in the vicinity of a zero of the gradient of the dispersion relation .",
    "this point was first clearly realized in @xcite , and it was shown that quantum fluctuations of the fermi surface can arise and lead to non  fermi liquid behaviour @xcite .",
    "in this situation , it is useful to have a method in which the adjustment of the fermi surface is done in the flow itself , because the concept of a non  fluctuating fermi surface itself may make sense only down to a certain scale , below which the fluctuations emerge and may become dominant .",
    "the method discussed in this paper allows to use dynamically adjusting scale decompositions and to study fermi surface flows . as a method",
    ", it applies more generally and can be used flexibly to adapt and adjust propagators in bosonic and fermionic ( or mixed ) systems , both for continuous and discrete flows .",
    "variants of the method are used in mathematical studies of fermi surface flows and fermi liquid theory @xcite .",
    "also , the method has already been used to calculate the fermi surface flow for the hubbard model ( see the appendix of @xcite ) .",
    "various renormalization group schemes have already been used to study correlated fermion systems : polchinski s original scheme @xcite , the wick ordered scheme @xcite , the 1pi scheme @xcite .",
    "flow equations for the 2pi functions were introduced @xcite and studied for quasi-1d systems @xcite . in this context",
    "one may well ask why one would want to investigate another scheme . in the following ,",
    "i give some further motivations for this .",
    "as is well  known , all the above  mentioned schemes are equivalent on the level of untruncated hierarchies , because all of them contain the full information about all green functions , as long as they are kept as infinite hierarchies .",
    "but they start to differ once the approximations that are necessary in nontrivial applications , are made , most importantly truncations of infinite hierarchies , gradient expansions of the generating functionals , or simplifying assumptions about the dependence of the green functions or vertices on momenta and frequencies .",
    "it is then useful to understand which features of a given scheme make it useful for a particular situation .",
    "all of the above  mentioned schemes include , in their untruncated form , all self  energy effects in the flow , albeit in a rather different way . in their original form ,",
    "the polchinski and wick ordered schemes keep self ",
    "energy effects as vertices , while the 1pi scheme includes them in the most natural way , namely by having full propagators on the lines . on the other hand ,",
    "the wick ordered scheme can be transformed so as to have full propagators on the lines ( see section 4.7.2 of @xcite ) , and a similar transformation also applies to the polchinski scheme .",
    "however , the standard momentum space setup of the rg with a cutoff in momentum space near to the fermi surface does not include an adaptive scale decomposition , and thus does not allow for the above  mentioned flow of the fermi surface .",
    "this is the case in all schemes , so a correct procedure would require using counterterms even in the 1pi scheme ( in most applied studies , the fermi surface shift was neglected , so that this problem did not appear ) .",
    "alternatively , one can try not to use a cutoff on the fermion momentum @xcite , but power counting has been done rigorously in more than one dimension only in the momentum space scheme @xcite .    in two or higher  dimensional applications , it is a serious practical problem to take the momentum and frequency dependence of the flowing vertex functions into account .",
    "the full propagator @xmath1 of the 1pi scheme has support on all scales above the cutoff scale .",
    "this makes it necessary to extend the loop integrals over all of momentum space , which in turn requires having an accurate form of @xmath1 , _ and _ of the higher vertex functions , over a wide range of momenta and frequencies .",
    "this has not been achieved so far .",
    "the situation in the other schemes is better in this respect : in the polchinski equation , all internal lines carry a derivative of the cutoff function .",
    "therefore , at scale @xmath2 , the propagators get evaluated only at values of the momentum @xmath3 with @xmath4 .",
    "the integration procedure for polchinski s equation makes the equation nonlocal in the scale parameter in the standard way @xcite , but a significant advantage is that whenever a momentum region @xmath5 further away from the fermi surface contributes to a loop integral in the flow equation , it does so only via a propagator on scale near to @xmath6 , which was already calculated in an earlier stage of the flow , and which does not need to be adjusted in every further integration step . in the wick ordered scheme , all propagators are supported at or below the cutoff , so only small neighbourhoods of the fermi surface occur in the loop integrals at low scales .",
    "thus the propagators and vertices are needed only close to the fermi surface and at small frequencies .    in studies and talks by the g \" ottingen group @xcite ,",
    "it was pointed out that in simple models , the 1pi scheme has a better strong coupling behaviour than the other schemes .",
    "namely , the 1pi flow equation is accurate in these toy models at much larger coupling values than one might believe at first , far beyond the weak coupling regime , and it remains accurate in a region of intermediate to strong couplings where all other schemes fail .",
    "the dynamically adjusting scheme is examined for this toy model in section 4 .",
    "it turns out that propagator adjustment , namely putting selfenergy effects into the denominator instead of keeping them as vertices , is a necessary , but not sufficient , ingredient in stabilizing the equations at strong coupling .",
    "the polchinski scheme still fails at strong coupling , while the dynamically adjusted wick ordered scheme is accurate up to arbitrarily large couplings .",
    "the analysis also clarifies the reasons for the success of the 1pi scheme . in section 4",
    ", i also give a more general discussion about strong initial couplings , and show that for reasons that are simple , but specific to the rg method , the `` weak  coupling '' rg flow is a well  defined starting point at strong coupling also in `` real '' models ( such as the two  dimensional hubbard model ) , contrary to what one may believe at first , and to what is stated in many places . whether this can be used efficiently in computations",
    "depends on certain relative rates of growth ; this is under investigation and will be discussed at the end .",

    "the integral in @xmath32 is a convergent finite  dimensional integral in the case of bosons . in the case of fermions",
    ", it is a linear functional on a finite  dimensional space .",
    "the theory can also contain both bosonic and fermionic fields .",
    "every formal functional integral can be regularized so that it takes this form .",
    "the logarithm of @xmath40 generates the connected green functions of the theory .",
    "assume that @xmath23 is invertible and let @xmath33 .",
    "a shift in the integration variable gives ( using the symmetry of the quadratic part under @xmath41 ) @xmath42 with @xmath43 the normalized gaussian measure with covariance @xmath26 . in this form ,",

    "typically , this situation arises by introducing cutoff functions that vanish strictly in parts of momentum space ; see the following examples .",
    "although the equations derived in this paper work for the general case set up above , it is useful to keep two prototypical examples in mind .    the first example is scalar field theory on a finite lattice @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 is the discrete laplacian with ( say ) dirichlet boundary conditions , and @xmath48 , with @xmath49 a polynomial that is bounded below . in that case",

    "@xmath73 is an even element of the grassmann algebra with @xmath74 . in the simplest case",

    "the number @xmath77 is an auxiliary quantity coming from an application of the lie ",
    "trotter product formula . to recover a representation of the partition function of the many  fermion model , as given by a trace over fock space , one must take @xmath78 first . for details , see chapter 4 of @xcite .",
    "the renormalization group comes into play when the inverse of @xmath23 becomes unbounded , or even fails to exist , in the limit @xmath79 , or when the inverse remains bounded , but its norm becomes nonuniform in an essential physical parameter . in the above examples , the fourier transform diagonalizes @xmath23 and one can read off that the eigenvalues go to zero in the limit of interest .",
    "in example 1 above , taking @xmath80 to be a cube of sidelength @xmath81 , @xmath82 with @xmath83 ; clearly , @xmath84 goes to zero for infinitely many @xmath85 in that limit , so that @xmath86 becomes singular .",
    "similarly , in example 2 , one gets zero eigenvalues when the temperature @xmath87 , and when @xmath88 . at small positive @xmath89 ,",
    "@xmath90 is of order @xmath91 . in both cases , @xmath92 , and thus @xmath26 itself , fails to be square integrable in the limit @xmath87 , so that integrals over a square of a propagator ( and higher powers of it ) are ill  defined .",
    "this is not just mathematical pedantry but physically relevant  if in the case of the many  fermion system , @xmath92 were square integrable at @xmath93 , there would be no superconductivity , because the superconducting gap is driven by the @xmath94 from @xmath95 .",
    "similarly , the singularity of @xmath96 in the bosonic case leads to anomalous decay exponents of correlation functions .",
    "hence in the following , a guideline for getting a useful rg equation in these systems is that _ squares of unregularized propagators are to be avoided_.    a standard approach to obtain a renormalization group equation @xcite in the above examples is as follows .",
    "introduce a scale parameter @xmath97 , an @xmath98dependent energy , say @xmath99 , which goes to zero in the limit @xmath100 .",
    "choose a fixed decreasing @xmath101 cutoff function @xmath102 with @xmath103 for @xmath104 and @xmath105 for @xmath106 , and set @xmath107 , so that @xmath108 is a smooth partition of unity .",
    "decompose the propagator into an infrared part @xmath109 and a part supported at higher scales , @xmath110 , via @xmath111 and define the effective action @xmath112 the partition function is then expressed in terms of the effective action as @xmath113 the effective action @xmath114 is a function of a fields which , when expanded in the fields , has a quadratic term . in infrared problems ,",
    "this term is relevant in the rg sense .",
    "that is , the order of the singularity may get changed , producing the anomalous exponents , in the scalar field theory example , or , in the many  fermion system , the changes to the quadratic term also shift the location of the singularity of the propagator , the fermi surface , in fourier space .",
    "the above scale decomposition does not take this into account , because it zooms in on the fixed fermi surface @xmath115 .",
    "therefore , with such a fixed choice of scale decomposition , counterterms are needed to avoid divergences @xcite .",
    "it is possible to justify the use of counterterms by an inversion theorem @xcite , but it seems desirable to have a simple method for moving the quadratic terms from @xmath114 into the propagator , in a way that the shift of the singularity gets included in the flow automatically . the flow introduced in this paper allows to put self  energy terms into the propagator and hence to define a convenient adaptive scale decomposition both in continous ( and in discrete ) renormalization group flows .",
    "it is such that an analogue of @xmath116 continues to hold , but with a propagator that changes dynamically in the flow , and @xmath117 replaced by an interaction from which all , or part of , the quadratic part is removed .",
    "finding a scheme that implements an adjusting scale decomposition in a differential equation is not completely straightforward . on graphical grounds ,",
    "one expects the full propagator to be @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the dyson self  energy .",
    "thus the first idea may be to make the ansatz @xmath120 with @xmath121 , @xmath122 to be determined .",
    "@xmath123 is well - defined because @xmath124 is nonzero only on a subspace where @xmath125 can be inverted , and the cutoff function now adapts dynamically because it depends on @xmath126 .",
    "the propagator of the unintegrated fields must be defined as @xmath127 to ensure that @xmath128 .",
    "but this has a singularity at the noninteracting fermi surface for any @xmath98 , as well as one developing on the new one , so ( apart from being a very unnatural object ) it does not vanish for @xmath100 , so that not all degrees of freedom get integrated out",
    ". then this flow would not give useful information about the model , even if it converged for @xmath100 .",
    "trying instead to keep the form of @xmath116 , but putting @xmath129 leads to disaster : the derivative @xmath130 contains a term @xmath131 , which has a square of the inverse , _ but no infrared cutoff _ because @xmath103 for @xmath104 . in all cases where the self  energy shifts the fermi surface , @xmath132 on the singularity set , so that effectively , a square of the propagator appears .",
    "because this propagator is not square integrable , this scheme leads to divergent integrals already in the rg differential equation at fixed @xmath98 .",
    "the method developed in the following sections avoids these problems .",
    "i now return to the general field theoretic situation of section [ secsetup ] and consider the generating function in the form @xmath133 , i.e.@xmath134 instead of @xmath135 i make the slightly more general choice @xmath136 where @xmath137 can be chosen as an operator that cuts off very large energies , chosen such that @xmath138 is @xmath139symmetric , and for bosons , nonnegative ( but @xmath140 is also allowed ) . in applications , such an ultraviolet cutoff allows to start the flow at a scale where degrees of freedom with very high energies have already been integrated over .",
    "the flow is set up by posing restrictions on the general , @xmath98dependent partition function @xmath141 here @xmath142 , @xmath1 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , _ and _ @xmath145 to be determined as functions of @xmath98 . for fixed @xmath98",
    ", @xmath146 is a complex number , @xmath144 is an operator , @xmath1 and @xmath145 are @xmath27symmetric operators , and @xmath147 is a function of the fields @xmath7 , which , for bosons , has to be such that the integral exists ( see below ) .",
    "i impose the following general conditions .",
    "1 .   @xmath148 , @xmath149 , and @xmath150 .",
    "2 .   for all @xmath151 and all @xmath7 , @xmath152 .",
    "3 .   @xmath153 as @xmath154 .    these conditions have the following simple interpretation .    1 .",
    "@xmath155 is the generating function of the model of interest .",
    "2 .   the generating function @xmath156 , and hence all correlation functions , are invariant under the rg .",
    "3 .   in the end , all degrees of freedom are integrated out .    the field ",
    "independent term @xmath157 is ( up to a factor @xmath158 ) equal to the free energy .",
    "the term involving @xmath159 naturally arises once one starts adding terms to the denominator of the propagator .",
    "this is most easily seen in the case when one requires that @xmath147 should contain no quadratic term in @xmath7 .",
    "then , if the limit @xmath100 exists and @xmath160 in that limit ( as required by condition 3 ) , @xmath161 because @xmath162 has no quadratic term for any @xmath98 , the same holds for @xmath163 .",
    "therefore the term involving @xmath164 is the only quadratic term and hence @xmath164 is the full propagator .",
    "the limit exists e.g.  if the temperature is above all critical temperatures @xcite or if the fermi surface is asymmetric under reflections @xcite .",
    "thus , the full propagator @xmath1 is built up gradually in the rg flow . for finite @xmath98 , @xmath165 has the usual rg interpretation that @xmath166 is the propagator of particles with interaction @xmath162 , but now @xmath162 can be chosen not to contain any self  energy terms .",
    "thus , even if the limit @xmath154 can not be taken because the flow is accurate only up to some @xmath167 ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) , the effective propagator and interaction can still be used as an input for the theory of the excitations with energy below @xmath168 .",
    "the above conditions do not determine @xmath146 and the functions @xmath169 , @xmath147 , @xmath170 , and @xmath171 uniquely .",
    "they are just the minimal conditions one wants to impose .",
    "the freedom of choosing the various functions can be used to impose the constraint that the quadratic part of @xmath162 should vanish , or that a certain part of it be removed from @xmath162 and put into @xmath171 instead .    the flow @xmath116 satisfies h1h3 , but it restricts to the propagator @xmath172 with the fixed scale function @xmath173 of @xmath174 , which does not adjust to a shifting location of the singularity .",
    "this condition is relaxed when one drops @xmath116 in favour of @xmath165 . in particular",
    ", one can choose the functions such that the propagator @xmath171 incorporates all , or part of , the selfenergy corrections .",

    "the conditions on @xmath177 are satisfied in the above examples and in most other interesting applications .",
    "2 .   the dependence of the cutoff function @xmath197 on @xmath195 allows for an @xmath98dependent , adaptive scale decomposition .",
    "this makes showing the existence of a solution to @xmath200 nontrivial .",
    "this existence problem will be discussed in more detail in section [ sec:2.9 ] .",
    "the fluctuation propagator @xmath201 given in @xmath202 is now indeed proportional to the derivative of the scale function , thus has an infrared cutoff .",

    "this must be so for general reasons , as will be explained in section [ diagrammar ] .",
    "the strategy to satisfy h3  as well is to choose a solution for which the support of @xmath197 becomes empty as @xmath100 , and for which the singularity of @xmath206 as @xmath154 is such that @xmath207 still vanishes in the limit .",
    "theorem [ th1 ] gives a family of solutions to the conditions h1   and h2  parametrized by @xmath208 .",
    "moreover , it will become clear in the proof that even given a fixed @xmath208 , there are many other possibilities to choose the equation for @xmath37 , and as explained , there is a further freedom of choosing @xmath209 as a function of @xmath177 when seeking a solution @xmath210 to @xmath200 .",
    "thus , there seems to be an enormous freedom in solving h1h2 . however , not every choice has good analytical properties , and most solutions diverge already at a small value of @xmath98 . to have a bounded solution on a maximal interval for @xmath98 requires a careful choice of @xmath181 .",
    "for instance , in the fermi surface problem in @xmath211 , @xmath208 must take the fermi surface shift into account fully ; whether it also needs to contain corrections to the fermi velocity and the coefficient of @xmath68 depends on finer details , such as the shape of the fermi surface . if this is done properly , the limit @xmath100 of the flow exists at temperatures above the mean  field transition temperature @xcite , and h3  is satisfied . 7 .",
    "compared to the polchinski equation obtained from @xmath116 by differentiating with respect to @xmath98 , which reads @xmath212 ( with @xmath213 as in @xmath174 ) , there are two changes .",
    "first , there are terms of order 0 and 2 in the fields @xmath7 on the right hand side of @xmath214 , which can be chosen to cancel the field  independent and quadratic part arising from the first term on the right hand side , so that @xmath215 starts with terms of order @xmath216 in @xmath189 .",
    "second , the fluctuation propagator @xmath201 now includes selfenergy corrections from the integration up to scale @xmath98 ( if @xmath181 is chosen to absorb only selected parts of the quadratic part generated by the integration , e.g.  only cancelling the fermi surface shift , then the propagator @xmath195 , and hence @xmath201 , contain only those ) . +",
    "thus @xmath214 has a simple and natural interpretation : the propagator is allowed to change dynamically , and the selfenergy ( or part of it ) can be put into the denominator .",
    "although the rhs of @xmath217 has the same structure as the first term on the rhs of @xmath214 , the change of the quadratic part , and the ensuing replacement of @xmath218 by @xmath201 leads to a major change in the behaviour of the rg equations .",
    "some aspects will be discussed in section [ toysec ] .      to make the proof more readable",
    ", i first give an algebraic derivation which applies both to bosons and fermions , and in a subsequent section provide the mathematical justifications of all steps .",
    "define the convolution with the gaussian measure as @xmath219 the partition function is @xmath220 if @xmath221 is differentiable in @xmath98 and @xmath189 , @xmath222 with @xmath223 the equation @xmath224 implies @xmath225 with @xmath226 using @xmath227 gives @xmath228 acting with @xmath229 on @xmath230 and using @xmath231 ( recall @xmath232 for bosons and @xmath233 for fermions ) i get @xmath234 with @xmath235 to simplify the equations , i remove the dilation term @xmath236 , i.e.choose @xmath144 so that @xmath237 this implies @xmath238 , so that @xmath239 this equation makes it natural to regard @xmath181 as an input , and to seek a solution for @xmath145,@xmath37 , and @xmath142 .",
    "once this is done , the remaining functions are obtained by integrating the equations @xmath240 and @xmath241 .",
    "let @xmath145 be of the form @xmath242 with @xmath195 and @xmath197 the solution to @xmath200 .",

    ", the amputation operator @xmath144 can now also be determined : @xmath243 , with initial condition @xmath244 has the unique solution @xmath245 stated in @xmath246 .",
    "thus theorem [ th1 ] is proven algebraically for bosons and fermions .",
    "adapting the derivation to the case of a theory involving bosons and fermions is straightforward , provided that the interaction @xmath247 is an even element of the grassmann algebra .      in the above derivation",
    ", it was assumed    1 .   that @xmath37 and @xmath156 are indeed differentiable in @xmath98 and in @xmath7 2 .   that @xmath248 holds , and 3 .",
    "that the commutator equations hold , when applied to @xmath249 .",
    "item 1 follows from the existence of the solution to the initial value problem for @xmath142 and @xmath37 , as stated in the hypotheses of theorem [ th1 ] ( and already explained there ) .    concerning item 2 ,",
    "note that for any polynomial @xmath250 in the fields , @xmath251 was proven in @xcite both for bosons and fermions , but @xmath249 is in general not a polynomial .",
    "similarly , the commutator equations @xmath252 and @xmath253 hold when applied to polynomials in @xmath7 , but again , the above proof involves an application to @xmath249 .    consider first the case of fermions . in the present setup , the grassmann algebra is finite  dimensional , so every function of the grassmann variables is a polynomial .",
    "thus @xmath254 and @xmath255 are polynomials in @xmath30 and @xmath256 is a polynomial , hence infinitely differentiable in @xmath7 .",
    "thus @xmath248 holds , and @xmath252 and @xmath253 hold as well",
    ". moreover @xmath257 is differentiable in @xmath98 by hypothesis of theorem [ th1 ] , and @xmath177 is differentiable in @xmath98 because it solves the differential equation @xmath200 , so @xmath145 is differentiable in @xmath98 as well .",
    "by @xmath248 , the convolution in @xmath165 is a polynomial in @xmath171 and in @xmath258 .",
    "thus by expanding @xmath37 in homogeneous parts of degree @xmath259 in @xmath189 ( see also section [ diagrammar ] ) , one easily proves by induction on @xmath260 that @xmath37 , and hence also @xmath156 , is differentiable in @xmath98 .    for bosons ,",
    "@xmath261 is not a polynomial , but , under our assumptions , it has a fast decay for @xmath262 .",
    "this decay and some analyticity could be used to justify first truncating @xmath249 to a polynomial and then taking a limit . a different , easier way",
    "to adapt the argument is to avoid @xmath248 , i.e.  go back to @xmath263 and use integration by parts  arguments of the type @xmath264 to bring the equation into the form @xmath265 where @xmath266 is the difference between the left and right hand sides of @xmath267 . keeping @xmath268 in the derivation and obtaining the general case of nonnegative @xmath145 by a limit ,",
    "an equation of this form implies that @xmath269 .",
    "this yields the same differential equation as the algebraic method of the previous section and thus completes the derivation for bosons .    in conclusion ,",
    "all steps in the derivation of the rg equations in the previous subsection are justified mathematically . in the case of fermions ,",
    "the smoothness of @xmath188 in @xmath98 and @xmath189 follows from easy general arguments . for bosons ,",
    "it is part of showing that the solution to the equations for @xmath37 and @xmath142 exists .",
    "for brevity i call the rg differential equation for @xmath270 and @xmath271 derived above the dynamical rg or dynrg equation . expansion of @xmath37 in powers of the fields gives a hierarchy of equations for the @xmath260point functions . in this section ,",
    "i assume that @xmath37 is even and choose @xmath208 and @xmath142 such that @xmath37 does not contain any quadratic and constant part , which gives the hierarchy with the simplest graphical structure .",
    "the expansion in the fields @xmath272 with @xmath273 homogeneous of degree @xmath259 in @xmath189 , leads to the hierarchy ( shown graphically for @xmath208 , @xmath274 and @xmath275 in figure [ fig1 ] ) @xmath276 by @xmath200 , @xmath277 reads @xmath278 so it integrates to @xmath279 for fermions , @xmath280 and @xmath281 , where pf @xmath282 denotes the pfaffian of the antisymmetric matrix @xmath177 . for covariances of the form @xmath283 , pf @xmath284 , so that @xmath285 for bosons , @xmath232 and @xmath286",
    ". thus for real bosons , @xmath287 for complex bosons with a hermitian covariance there is a factor @xmath288 which squares this to @xmath289 .",
    "thus the relation of the operator @xmath177 to the free energy density is simple : if @xmath290 for @xmath100 , the free energy is ( modulo a conventional factor of the inverse temperature ) simply given by @xmath291 this also clarifies why the equation @xmath292 for @xmath1 can not simply be @xmath293 : the exact relation between the full propagator @xmath1 and the free energy involves the luttinger ",
    "ward functional .",
    "it is a nice feature of the dynrg flow that the relation between @xmath177 and the free energy @xmath142 is so simple .",
    "clearly , the diagrammatic structure of the hierarchy ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) differs from the polchinski hierarchy obtained from @xmath217 by the absence of one  particle functions ( or two  point functions ) which get absorbed into @xmath177 via the equation @xmath294 for @xmath208 and @xmath200 .",
    "the standard iterative solution of this hierarchy produces a graphical expansion .",
    "it should be noted that from a purely graphical perspective , the dynamical propagator adjustment does not make any of the functions one  irreducible .",
    "this is obvious for the six  point and higher functions , but also holds for the graphs contributing to the four  point function @xmath274 and to @xmath208 : taking the tree diagram of the six  point function and joining two legs of one of the vertices to a tadpole produces a one  reducible contribution to @xmath274 , taking two legs of the other vertex and joining them to a tadpole gives a one  reducible contribution to @xmath208 .",
    "the point here is that these two  point insertions ( the _ single - scale insertions _ defined in @xcite ) are harmless because they do not generate singularities . in the fermi surface example , the size of such an insertion at scale @xmath98 is by power counting ( see @xcite ) of order @xmath295 , while the size of the propagators on the adjoining lines is of order @xmath296 .",
    "thus the combination of two propagators and such a two  point insertion is of order @xmath297 , which is the same size as a single propagator .",
    "however , if one inserted a two  point graph that is integrated from @xmath298 to @xmath98 , its value would be @xmath299",
    ". then the combination of this insertion with two propagators is of size @xmath300 , hence @xmath301 larger than it should be .",
    "it is contributions of this type that lead to a problem with unrenormalized expansions . here ,",
    "this problem does not arise because renormalization is implemented by a changing propagator . in summary , for the analytic questions , namely which terms are large and which are small , the reducible graphs contributing to @xmath274 and @xmath208 are inessential .      expanding in wick ordered polynomials provides essential simplifications in the mathematical analysis of the rg equations @xcite ; moreover the wick ordered scheme has been useful for calculations in two  dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "a distinctive feature of the wick ordered equation is that all propagators are supported on scales below @xmath302 , so that only low ",
    "energy degrees of freedom enter the integration . in the many ",
    "fermion example , this means that all momentum integrals are restricted to a neighbourhood of the fermi surface .",
    "therefore projections to the fermi surface , which are needed to solve the equations numerically , are better under control than in other schemes .",
    "an further advantage is that structures of overlapping loops @xcite become explicit in the equations and make the study of improvements to power counting much easier .",
    "these improvements are needed for showing fermi liquid behaviour in higher dimensions and controlling two  particle interactions .    a natural ( but not the only ) way to fix the wick ordering covariance is to require that tadpoles be removed . in the case of the fixed scale decomposition",
    "@xmath174 , this is easy to do : the condition to cancel tadpoles is to have @xmath303 , because then the linear term in the rgde drops out @xcite . in this case",
    ", the solution to that equation is simply @xmath304 , with the @xmath109 of @xmath174 . in the adaptive scheme @xmath214",
    ", the corresponding equation is @xmath305 which is _ not _ solved by @xmath306 .",
    "the reason for this is simply that a wick ordering that removes all tadpoles requires information about the propagator at later scales @xmath307 , which requires solving self  consistency equations . in theoretical studies ,",
    "this self  consistency can be solved by fixed  point arguments .",
    "alternatively , one can choose the wick ordering covariance such that it leads to the above improvements without cancelling tadpoles exactly .",

    "there are some further conditions on @xmath316 that were automatically satisfied in the case without propagator adjustment in @xcite .",

    "in this section , i briefly discuss the fermi surface flow in @xmath525 in the scheme without wick ordering . a discrete fermi surface flow with wick ordering is defined and controlled mathematically for @xmath526 in @xcite .",

    "although different methods , such as the @xmath89flow of @xcite have been used to calculate rg flows , and other regularizations , such as a cutoff on the frequencies only , are possible , the momentum space flow remains the only one where precise mathematical estimates for power counting of all green functions , not just the first few truncations , have been given @xcite .",
    "let the covariance and interaction be those of the standard many ",
    "fermion system with short  range interaction @xmath75 , as described in the introduction , with @xmath78 .",
    "( for more details , see @xcite , chapter 4 ) . in fourier space ,",
    "the covariance is a multiplication operator , namely the inverse of @xmath527 times the unit matrix in spin space . here",
    "@xmath71 is the dispersion relation for free particles , given by the hopping amplitudes of the model . by standard ( formal ) diagrammatics , the full propagator is the inverse of @xmath528 , with @xmath529 the fermion self  energy .",
    "one natural choice for would then be to take @xmath177 as the full propagator , with @xmath529 understood to depend on @xmath98 ( but without a cutoff function ) . in the following ,",
    "i shall discuss another choice , where only the frequency zero part of the selfenergy is put into the denominator .",
    "this then implies that @xmath49 still has a quadratic part , but one which vanishes at zero frequency . in cases where the field renormalization is a marginally relevant parameter",
    ", one can also put in the linear part of @xmath530 in @xmath531 .",
    "thus the freedom in chosing @xmath208 and @xmath177 allows to adapt to the situation at hand , while keeping the denominator as simple as possible .",
    "so , let @xmath532 in terms of the scale  dependent self ",
    "energy @xmath533 , @xmath534 , so that the difference @xmath535 vanishes at @xmath536 .",
    "let @xmath537 be a decreasing cutoff function with @xmath538 for @xmath539 and @xmath540 for @xmath106",
    ". set @xmath541 ( another choice would be to use a cutoff on the frequencies as well : @xmath542 .    with this choice , @xmath162 still has a quadratic part , which is of the form @xmath543 with @xmath544 ( here @xmath545 , and @xmath546 @xmath547 with @xmath548 the set of fermionic matsubara frequencies ) .",
    "thus with this choice of moving only frequency  independent parts of the selfenergy into the denominator , there remain some quadratic terms in the action .",
    "but by construction , these terms vanish on the fermi surface ( see @xmath549 ) , and hence do not cause divergences .",

    "this is essentially a restriction on the size of @xmath571  it will fail if @xmath571 gets so large that its backreaction on @xmath568 becomes of order 1 .",
    "a sufficent condition is @xmath572 in a suitable norm .",
    "this allows to rewrite @xmath573 as @xmath574 because @xmath567 depends on @xmath568 , it is necessary to find a set of @xmath568 on which @xmath575 uniformly .",
    "the existence of this set already requires conditions on @xmath71 ; the set is then essentially a ball around @xmath71 .",
    "the general theory of ordinary differential equations then implies existence and uniqueness of the solution for all @xmath98 in some bounded interval , provided that @xmath576 is lipschitz . proving that this condition is satisfied is again nontrivial , in fact it is closely related to questions of possible symmetry breaking .",
    "3 .   to get global existence (",
    "i.e.  for all @xmath98 , one needs to prove that the flow actually never leaves the ball around @xmath71 .",
    "4 .   in steps 13 ,",
    "@xmath49 was still regarded as fixed ; in the true system of equations , @xmath571 depends on @xmath98 and the rhs of the equation for @xmath577 depends on @xmath568 as well .",
    "thus one needs to show that @xmath571 stays bounded .",
    "there is a similar set of steps for the discrete fermi surface flow .",
    "steps 13 are already nontrivial , but the hard part is including 4 , because it requires dealing with the hierarchy as a whole . for the differential equation ,",
    "an all  order proof that steps 14 work can be given along the lines of @xcite .",
    "a nonperturbative proof , i.e.  without truncation on the hierarchy , remains an open problem , mainly because to this day there are no good nonperturbative bounds for the continous rg equation @xcite , which would be needed in step 4 .",
    "up to now , this step requires an integration over short scale intervals and corresponding estimates on discrete rg transformations @xcite .",
    "such a proof is given in the wick ordered approach , for two  dimensional fermi systems , in @xcite .",
    "in particular , the boundedness of @xmath571 necessary in step 4 can be shown in the temperature range of the fermi liquid criterion of @xcite .",
    "these mathematical points also correspond to physically natural problems .",
    "the question of the existence of the inverse of @xmath578 is , in physical terms , basic to the consistency of the method itself : the rg flow is parametrized by energy scales on the ( changing ) kinetic part of the action , i.e.  the part quadratic in the fields . the nonquadratic interaction part is not taken into account when labelling the scales .",
    "however , it influences the change @xmath559 of the quadratic part , and the equations become inconsistent when this change becomes larger than the maximal kinetic energy scale itself . note that it is this condition that is important in the flow ; the typical interaction energy , measured by the coupling constant , can be much larger than the scale @xmath302 , and this situation indeed occurs at low scales in all nontrivial models because @xmath579 for @xmath100 .",
    "it is a nontrivial fact of fermionic field theory that the method can be controlled by convergent expansions even in that situation @xcite .",
    "the invertibility of @xmath195 at all scales @xmath98 is related to this ; the @xmath98dependent fermi surface must never leave the region where @xmath580 , otherwise an inconsistency manifests itself as divergences in the equation .",
    "this condition can be satisfied because power counting implies that the selfenergy at scale @xmath98 is of order @xmath302 times the coupling constant ( in fact , improved power counting @xcite gives a better @xmath98behaviour of the bound , which is needed to control derivatvies of the selfenergy in the flow ) .",
    "the counterterms used in @xcite can be obtained from the adaptive flow : if @xmath581 exists , the difference @xmath582 can be taken as the counterterm @xmath142 of @xcite .",
    "this can be used to avoid solving the inversion equation @xcite .",
    "however , the question whether there is a one  to  one relation between the free and the interacting dispersion function and fermi surface , which is answered by the inversion theorem , is not solved this way .",
    "the need to invert @xmath583 for a tadpole operator @xmath567 also arises in the 1pi scheme when one reexpresses the single  scale propagator @xmath144 in terms of the full propagator @xmath584 in the equation for the self  energy @xmath585 @xcite . with the tadpole operator defined in a natural way , the equation for the selfenergy in the 1pi hierarchy becomes @xmath586 where @xmath587 is the 1-irreducible two ",
    "particle vertex and @xmath1 is the full green function .",
    "this equation can be rewritten as @xmath588 more generally , the occurrence of such operators can be expected in any scheme where the propagator changes , be it with an adaptive scale decomposition , as done here , or without ( as in the usual 1pi hierarchy ) .",
    "the flow discussed here can be adapted to a flow where the density , not the chemical potential @xmath589 , is kept fixed .",
    "this variant was used in the appendix of @xcite to calculate the flow of the fermi surface at fixed density in the hubbard model .",
    "in this section , i study the flow equations for a very simple example , namely the integral over one complex variable , corresponding to the partition function of a zero  dimensional complex bosonic field , @xmath590 with @xmath591 , re @xmath592 ( for simplicity , i take @xmath593 real in the calculations below . ) , and @xmath594 a complex source field . for @xmath595 , @xmath596 .",
    "thus it is simply a two  dimensional integral .",
    "this analysis is motivated by @xcite , where it was observed that the 1pi rg equations give an accurate solution for a function similar to @xmath597 even for large @xmath598 .",
    "this is unexpected at first sight because the diagrammatic approach to these equations may suggest that they are useful only for small @xmath598 .",
    "moreover , it is interesting because only the combination of rg and irreducibility seemed to induce the good behaviour at large couplings , namely ( 1 ) in contrast to the 1pi scheme , the other schemes studied in @xcite , namely polchinski s original hierarchy and the wick ordered hierarchy of @xcite , were accurate only at small @xmath598 , as one would expect from small  coupling schemes and ( 2 ) perturbation theory for the 1pi vertices @xmath599 fails as badly as in the other schemes when the coupling constant is not small .",
    "thus it is not merely irreducibility , but a different feature of the 1pi rg hierarchy , that makes for the difference",
    ".    a closer look at the equations reveals a first crucial feature : the 1pi equation contains the selfenergy @xmath600 in the denominator .",
    "when @xmath593 gets large , @xmath600 becomes of order @xmath601 after a very short flow time already , and ( because the signs conspire well in this toy model ) the factor @xmath593 in the numerator is balanced by a factor @xmath593 in the denominator , which prevents the right hand side of the flow equation from getting very large .",
    "this suggests that a dynamic adjustment of the propagator , such as discussed in this paper , improves the behaviour of the other hierarchies as well .",
    "this is the case , but the above explanation is not the full story , as we shall see in the following .",
    "although we have written @xmath40 as a function of @xmath594 , it is understood that it also depends on @xmath602 . indeed , by the @xmath603 symmetry of the measure it depends only on @xmath604 .",
    "a gaussian transformation gives the representation @xmath605 from which analyticity in @xmath606 is obvious .",
    "write @xmath607 rescaling the integration variable in @xmath608 , one gets @xmath609 where @xmath610 is analytic in @xmath611 for @xmath612 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath613 this convergent expansion gives the behaviour at large @xmath593 as @xmath614 and @xmath615 with @xmath616 thus for large @xmath593 , the @xmath617 moments of the integral , which play the role of the @xmath259point functions in this toy model , become small .",
    "in the following i discuss to what extent this can be reproduced by the rg with propagator adjustment .",
    "the usual shift gives @xmath618 with the notations @xmath619 and @xmath620 .",
    "as in the general case , write @xmath621 and impose @xmath622 , @xmath623 , @xmath624 , @xmath625 , @xmath626 , as well as @xmath627 .",
    "the rg equations are derived using straightforward differentiation , in analogy to the general case .",
    "expand @xmath628 and for @xmath325 @xmath629 the initial interaction @xmath630 has no constant and quadratic part .",
    "we now impose that the function @xmath631 has the same properties . by requiring @xmath632 and @xmath633 .",
    "this gives equations for @xmath562 and @xmath3 : @xmath634 finally , we fix the flow by setting @xmath635 where @xmath636 is to be determined and @xmath637 a given function of @xmath98 that decreases from @xmath638 to @xmath639 ( here we take @xmath640 as the final value of the flow parameter . in this simple example",
    ", we do not need to make @xmath209 depend on @xmath641 ) .",
    "we require @xmath641 and @xmath209 to be nonnegative to have the same for @xmath642 , so that the gaussian measure is really a measure .",
    "now set @xmath643 then @xmath644 .",

    ", a glance at @xmath660 and @xmath661 reveals that @xmath662 .",

    "the difference of the true second moment to the one calculated in this truncation is much bigger : @xmath684 but the qualitative behaviour , namely the vanishing at large @xmath593 , is still reproduced correctly .",
    "the fourth order moment has the right scaling as a function of @xmath593 , but the coefficient is too large .",
    "the usual polchinski hierarchy would not have given even a qualitatively correct behaviour of these coefficients . clearly , the adjustment of the propagator is crucial for large @xmath593 because the end result @xmath685 for the quadratic term is very different from the starting value @xmath686 at large @xmath593 .",
    "however , the adjustment of the propagator alone is not sufficient for obtaining good asymptotics at large @xmath593 because truncations at higher @xmath260 improve the result only for small @xmath593 , but not at large @xmath593 . to see this ,",
    "let us now truncate by setting @xmath687 , so that @xmath688 becomes @xmath689 this corresponds to the usual truncation of the polchinski equation , where the six  point function is replaced by the tree contribution ( see figure [ fig3 ] ) . used to obtain the one  loop equation for the four  point function . in the general case ,",
    "@xmath690 is converted into an integral equation which is then substituted back into @xmath691 , leading to a flow equation for @xmath646 that is nonlocal in the scale parameter @xmath98 . in the toy model , @xmath691 and @xmath690",
    "can be combined to @xmath692 because @xmath693 at small @xmath694 by @xmath688 , @xmath695 with this , @xmath691 becomes @xmath696 and @xmath697 and @xmath669 now become a closed system .",
    "now there is a serious problem : @xmath646 decreases in the flow because @xmath698 is negative , but this decrease never stops : even if @xmath699 , the @xmath593 term in @xmath697 keeps @xmath700 negative , and the flow then goes to negative @xmath646 and becomes unstable .",
    "a numerical analysis of higher truncations shows a partial stabilization , but there is still an instability already at moderately large @xmath593 .",
    "the reason for this behaviour will be discussed in the next subsections .",
    "the above findings for the toy model can be understood easily in more general terms .",
    "the lowest truncation of the hierarchy is well  behaved in the toy model because the correction to @xmath701 has a good sign , i.e.  @xmath702 remains positive for all @xmath98 because the @xmath703dependent terms get added to it ( in addition , it is reasonably accurate ) .",
    "the higher truncations become unstable at large couplings because the hierarchy is effectively nonlocal in the flow parameter : if one truncates by putting the eight  point function to zero , the right hand side of the flow equation for the six  point function @xmath704 becomes a tree diagram of four  point functions , so that the equation can be integrated , and the equation for the four  point function @xmath646 becomes ( assuming @xmath705 ) @xmath706 the graphical representation of this procedure is shown in figure [ fig3 ] . because the entire flow history gets inserted on the right hand side , it does not help if @xmath646 decreases in the flow because there is always the contribution from small @xmath707 where @xmath708 is still close to @xmath593 , hence large .",
    "this is the generalization of the right hand side of @xmath697 , in which the @xmath593 term kept driving the flow to negative @xmath646 even at @xmath699 .",
    "thus the nonlocality in the flow parameter makes it impossible to see in this truncation that the effective coupling constant decreases , _ but remains positive _ , even at large initial coupling .",
    "in contrast , the 1pi equation is local in the flow parameter , and the just described `` infrared asymptotic freedom '' of the toy model at large @xmath593 is seen easily .",
    "thus in conclusion , to use the truncated equations at strong coupling it is necessary that the scheme is stable in the sense that asymptotic freedom is not violated in these truncations even at large couplings .      in the light of the above discussion",
    ", one may ask how an adaptive wick ordered scheme would fare in this example , because the wick ordered equation also has the property that it is local in the flow parameter . as shown below",
    ", the wick ordered flow turns out to be well  behaved .",
    "in fact , already the initial wick ordering provides a reasonable approximation to the true result at large @xmath593 .",
    "as already discussed in previous sections , wick ordering has to be done self ",
    "consistently if one wants to keep the interaction free of quadratic terms .",
    "the initial wick ordering provides , when done self  consistently , the solution of the mean  field theory ( hartree  fock equations ) as a starting point for the flow . in the toy model , self  consistent wick ordering means finding @xmath709 such that @xmath710 because @xmath711 and @xmath712 , the analogue of @xmath713 is @xmath714 comparison of the quadratic terms in @xmath715 gives the self  consistency condition @xmath716 the integral becomes @xmath717 and the standard shift operations then give @xmath718 in contrast to mean  field equations in @xmath57 dimensions , no integrations appear in the self ",
    "consistency relation @xmath719 .",
    "it is simply a quadratic equation with solution    @xmath720    for small @xmath593 , @xmath721 gives an @xmath722 correction to @xmath701 , and @xmath723 gives the lowest order correction to @xmath724 . for large @xmath593 , @xmath725",
    "originally , the strength of the coupling is given by the `` dimensionless '' ratio @xmath726 .",
    "after the initial wick ordering , this has decreased to @xmath727 thus the `` strong coupling problem '' in this integral is removed already by the initial wick ordering .",
    "motivated by this , one can evaluate the remaining convolution integral in @xmath728 to first order in @xmath593 , to get the approximation @xmath729 at large @xmath593 , inserting @xmath730 gives @xmath731 comparison with @xmath732 and @xmath733 shows that this approximation for @xmath734 differs from the exact value by 8 % , the one for the prefactor of @xmath735 in @xmath685 differs from the exact value by 12 % , and the approximation for the prefactor of @xmath736 in @xmath737 differs from the true value by less than 50 % .",
    "note that these are the prefactors ; the asymptotic behaviour as a function of @xmath593 comes out correctly .",
    "thus a simple initial wick ordering , together with first order perturbation theory , gives a reasonable approximation for @xmath738 even at arbitrarily large @xmath593 .",
    "let us now consider the simplest truncation of the wick ordered flow with this initial condition .",
    "for the toy example , the choice @xmath739 is possible , so we use this to fix the wick ordering covariance .",
    "it has the advantage that @xmath740 is determined without any self ",
    "consistency argument , but on the other hand , some tadpole terms remain in the equation . setting @xmath741 with @xmath742 and expanding @xmath743 ,",
    "the rg equations for the wick ordered functions read @xmath744 the initial condition is given by the result of initial wick ordering as ( fixing @xmath745 in the definition of @xmath156 and recalling @xmath721 ) @xmath746 and the function @xmath747 is given by @xmath748 the numerator is the value  in this toy model  of the two  loop sunset diagram which is the only one contributing to @xmath747 in the truncation @xmath749 .",
    "the denominator in the definition of @xmath747 comes from a tadpole term , which is there because @xmath750 .",
    "this is a special case of the term @xmath751 discussed in the previous section .",
    "again , the sign is nice in the toy example  for @xmath752 , the denominator is always at least @xmath753 , so this inversion does not introduce singularities . only the equations @xmath754 and @xmath755 are coupled ; once their solution has been obtained , the other two simply follow by integration .",
    "transform to the `` dimensionless '' functions @xmath756 then @xmath757   \\ ] ] with @xmath758 and @xmath759 .",
    "given the solution of @xmath760 , @xmath761 is obtained from the solution of @xmath762 equation @xmath760 can be integrated explicitly but it is more instructive simply to note that @xmath763 is decreasing and @xmath764 for all @xmath765 because @xmath766 and the right hand side of @xmath760 is negative and vanishes for @xmath767 ( the last property failed for the polchinski  type equation ) .",
    "thus @xmath768 appears only with @xmath769 $ ] . with @xmath770",
    "this implies @xmath771 , hence @xmath772 thus the solution for @xmath763 is bounded above and below by that of the prototypical equation for `` asymptotic freedom '' .",
    "solving this equation and setting @xmath640 gives @xmath773 .",
    "thus there is no instability in the wick ordered scheme .    to obtain the coefficient of @xmath736 in @xmath737 , the correct starting values are @xmath770 and @xmath774 . with this , the truncated equations give the approximation @xmath775 which differs from the exact value given in @xmath733 by about 20 % .",
    "the solution for @xmath671 gives @xmath776 .",
    "comparison with @xmath733 shows a deviation of the coefficient of @xmath735 of about @xmath777 .    in summary ,",
    "the bad behaviour of the polchinski  type scheme at large couplings is absent from the wick ordered adaptive flow .",
    "the standard truncation @xmath778 is stable and reproduces the coefficients of the expansion of the exact result in inverse powers of @xmath593 well , i.e.  with errors of order 1  10 % .",
    "of course , the equation can also be used for all ( not only large ) values of @xmath593 , where it has to be evaluated numerically .",
    "the stability properties are independent of @xmath593 .",
    "the numerical values are in good agreement with the exact result .",
    "a similarly good strong coupling behaviour of the wick ordered functions may also be expected in the more general examples discussed in @xcite .      in this section",
    "i briefly discuss the question of well  definedness of the rg flow in fermionic systems at large couplings .",
    "it has been stated in many places that the rg hierarchy is a diagrammatic method that can not be taken as a starting point at strong coupling .",
    "the true situation is , however , not really so bad : the very strategy of the rg of integrating out degrees of freedom in small steps makes the rg flow well  defined also at large values of the initial coupling function .",
    "this is not a special feature of the differential equations but holds also for discrete rg flows , provided the stepsize is chosen small enough .    to see this ,",
    "consider a fermionic theory , as defined in the introduction . by integrating the rgde over short intervals , or using a discrete transformation",
    ", one can show that the generating function @xmath779 has the representation @xmath780 where in @xmath781 , the argument @xmath37 appears @xmath782 times and @xmath783 }   { \\prod\\limits}_{t \\in t }   \\delta_c^{(t ) } { \\prod\\limits}_{q=1}^p { { \\cal v}}_q ( \\psi_q ) { { { \\rbrack\\!\\rbrack}}}\\ ] ] where @xmath784 is the set of all trees on @xmath782 vertices , and @xmath156 is a probability measure ( i.e.  positive and normalized , @xmath785 ) , and @xmath786 is a positive definite @xmath787 matrix with diagonal entries equal to @xmath753 .",
    "both @xmath156 and @xmath788 can be written down explicitly , but only the above  mentioned properties matter ( see @xcite , where the above formula is derived and explained in more detail ) .",
    "@xmath789 can be thought of as a resummation of the perturbation expansion in terms of trees . because @xmath790 , the sum converges if the contribution of every tree @xmath89 can be bounded by @xmath791 . for fermions",
    ", this can be shown using determinant bounds ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) . the crucial point for the present discussion",
    "is that for a short  range interaction @xmath37 sufficient conditions for convergence are that the determinant constant @xmath792 of @xmath26 ( see @xcite ) and the decay constant @xmath793 are so small that @xmath794 . in a rg flow with stepsize @xmath478 , the covariance @xmath26 is split into many small parts @xmath795 and in every rg step , the @xmath26 in the above formula is replaced by @xmath795 . because @xmath796 and @xmath797 , the above convergence condition can be satisfied for any @xmath703 by making the rg stepsize @xmath478 small enough .",
    "thus , for small enough @xmath478 the first steps in the rg integration are given by convergent perturbation theory in @xmath703 , and therefore the rg flow can be started at large coupling . the really interesting analytical and physical question is whether a large , repulsive local initial interaction indeed decreases in the course of the flow ( i.e.  it gets screened ) , and whether the rate of this decrease is so fast that the flow can be controlled in the regime where the local coupling is not yet small , as is the case in the toy model .",
    "one may indeed expect that a strong on  site repulsion gets screened in the course of an rg flow , because even a hard  core condition gets softened , thus effectively weaker when one considers larger blocks on the lattice .",
    "namely , if there is a strong on  site repulsion , double occupancy of single sites is exponentially suppressed , but hopping into a block of @xmath798 lattice sites , @xmath799 , is still possible because of local fluctuations in the number density , even if the overall density is fixed .",
    "a standard example for a stochastic system with a hopping term and a hard  core repulsion is the asymmetric exclusion process .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that averaging in a suitable way effectively allows to _ remove _ the hard  core constraint in this model and still get precise asymptotics of the decay of correlations . because the truncations of the correlation hierarchy in this example have the property that they provide successive upper and lower bounds for the exact solution , one can obtain their asymptotic properties in some detail @xcite .",
    "for fermion systems , such monotonicity properties are in general not known , nevertheless averaging , such as provided by the rg , seems a very promising strategy to see screening effects .",
    "in fact , a low  order evaluation of the flow at very large scales in the two  dimensional hubbard model shows the screening , as well as the generation of the usual antiferromagnetic interaction term @xcite .",
    "the above argument is about the issue of the behaviour of an _ initial _ strong short ",
    "range interaction .",
    "the `` flow to strong coupling '' at low scales that has been observed in studies of initially weakly coupled systems is an independent phenomenon ( as discussed in @xcite , such flows may be kept under control for a while by phase space arguments , but eventually , the growth of the coupling function wins ) .",
    "the growth of certain parts of the coupling function in these flows is really due to the emergence of order parameter fluctuations that become more and more long  range , hence lead to fermionic interaction vertices that develop singularities in momentum space at a scale where symmetries get broken . in situations",
    "where , e.g.   the singular part of the fermionic four  point function can be parametrized by an exchange of a boson that becomes massless at a certain scale , approximations that set the momentum of this boson to zero give a coupling constant of order @xmath800 which `` runs to strong coupling '' and diverges at a certain scale . whether the boson can really become massless depends on the situation , in particular the dimensionality of the system",
    "moreover , in systems with long  range interactions , the anderson ",
    "higgs mechanism may interfere .",
    "however , unless this is the case , the goldstone theorem implies such singularities whenever continuous symmetries are broken .",
    "because such singularities occur only at points , their effect is very different from that of a strong local interaction , which is equally large everywhere in momentum space .",
    "the rg equations developed here allow for a dynamical adjustment of propagators in a convenient and flexible way .",
    "in particular , they allow for countinuously adjusted scale decompositions , which are useful in fermi surface studies , when one wants to avoid the use of counterterms , or fix the density ( instead of the chemical potential ) in rg flows .",
    "a numerical study of the adaptive flow equation discussed here , with fixed density , was done for the two  dimensional hubbard model in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "a mathematical study for the case of regular fermi surfaces is in @xcite .",
    "taking the fermi surface deformation into account is important also for the case of singular fermi surfaces , where the question of pinning of the fermi surface at van hove singularities can be addressed using such flows .",
    "this situation is studied in @xcite using counterterms .",
    "the adaptive method is expected to lead to useful results also here .    in flows with fermion and boson fields ,",
    "a generalization of the strategy for the adaptive flow becomes obvious : quartic terms in the fermions contribute to the boson propagators , so the dynamical adjustment of the boson propagator allows to take out also certain terms from the fermionic four  point function .",
    "a related method has already been used in the 1pi scheme in @xcite ; a straightforward generalization of the method developed here will allow to do it in any scheme .",
    "finally , the role of the propagator adjustment for the strong coupling behaviour of flows was investigated for a very simple toy model .",
    "it was shown that the wick ordered scheme with dynamic propagator adjustment correctly reproduces the asymptotic behaviour for arbitrarily large couplings , and already its simplest truncation gives the coefficients of the leading term in the asymptotic series with an error of order 1  10 % ( depending on the order of the moment ) .",
    "the analysis made clear that the adjustment of propagators is indeed crucial for the success of a scheme at strong coupling , but that in addition , a stability property of the four  point flow is necessary .",
    "namely , the rg equations must be such that asymptotic freedom holds for the solution also if the flow is started at a large value of the coupling .",
    "the polchinski scheme does not have the second property , even with an adapted propagator , but the 1pi and wick ordered schemes do .",
    "needless to say , the toy example is very special because there , the signs work out such that a large initial coupling @xmath593 decreases to a very small final value , and the quadratic term @xmath701 increases to a large final value . because only the combination @xmath801 matters , this effectively leads to a very rapid transition to a small  coupling situation in the flow , provided the above  mentioned stability holds .",
    "this explains the success of the 1pi and wick ordered scheme . in the latter , already the initial wick ordering removes the strong coupling problem right away , if it is done self - consistently",
    ". it would be too much to hope for such benign signs in more general ( and more interesting ) models , but , as discussed in some detail in section [ scgen ] , the flow equations are well  defined at strong coupling ( contrary to what has often been stated in the literature ) and there are reasons to be optimistic about screening of initially strong local repulsions in rg flows .",
