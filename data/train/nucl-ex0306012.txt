    "the three - nucleon system is both fascinating and remarkable . despite decades of intensive study with increasingly sophisticated theoretical tools , fundamental facets of the system remain mysterious , confusing , and contradictory .",
    "realistic nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) potentials underbind @xmath13he and @xmath13h by several hundred kev @xcite .",
    "the p - d and n - d scattering lengths in the doublet _ s_-wave channel , which are apparently strongly correlated to the @xmath13he and @xmath13h binding energies respectively , are likewise poorly predicted by nn force models .",
    "convergence between theory and experiment for these fundamental parameters can be obtained only by the _",
    "ad hoc _ admixture of three - nucleon ( 3n ) forces .",
    "although it is well understood that 3n forces must exist with a weaker strength and shorter range than the nn force , little else is known .",
    "the incomplete nature of current 3n force models is demonstrated by their tendency to resolve certain problems , such as tri - nucleon underbinding , at the expense of exacerbating discrepancies in other observables @xcite .    of course one must first understand two - nucleon forces in detail before one can isolate possible 3n force effects .",
    "a wide variety of nn forces are deployed in modern nuclear physics calculations , but they have certain features in common .",
    "they all employ short - range , semi - phenomenological forces matched to a one pion exchange potential ( opep ) tail beyond @xmath14  fm , and they all give roughly the same results for the low - energy observables .",
    "they are all constrained to reproduce the nn observables as well as the properties of the deuteron .",
    "they also must incorporate deviations from isospin symmetry to describe the data .",

    "p scattering lengths@xcite .    the accessible places to look for 3n force effects are the bound states of @xmath11h and @xmath11he and the scattering states of n - d and p - d . since @xmath11h and n - d are free from electromagnetic complications ( both theoretical and experimental ) , they are the systems of choice for precision tests . for all of these systems ,",
    "the computational tools presently available are believed to be excellent .",
    "`` exact '' fadeev solutions are available for the scattering states below the deuteron breakup threshold . above breakup threshold ,",
    "the n - d equations can also be solved exactly throughout the entire range of applicability of the potential models employed .",
    "in addition to these exact models , other methods based on the reactance matrix ( _ k_-matrix ) , such as the hyperspherical harmonic expansion of kievsky _",
    "et al._@xcite , the effective field theory of bedaque _",
    "et al._@xcite , as well as dispersion theory / phenomenological models such as that of hale@xcite , provide complementary insights and information that goes beyond tests of potential models .",
    "recently , significant insight into certain features of three - nucleon systems has come from the effective field theory ( eft ) approach @xcite .",
    "eft has been used to solve the three nucleon problem with short - range interactions in a systematic expansion in the small momentum region set by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the momentum transfer and @xmath17 is the scattering length .",
    "for the two - body system eft is equivalent to effective range theory and reproduces its well - known results @xcite .",
    "the chiral eft expansion does not require the introduction of an operator corresponding to a 3n force until next - to - next - to leading order ( nnlo ) in the expansion , and at this order it requires only two low energy constants@xcite .",
    "with these two parameters determined from experiment , chiral eft can make precise predictions for other three - body observables .",
    "it is clear that precision measurements of the three - nucleon scattering lengths provide both valuable theoretical benchmarks and critical input parameters for the study of three - nucleon systems .    the most important data , of course , is the measurement of the zero - energy scattering . with the neutron interferometer at nist , we have made measurements of the coherent n - p and n - d bound scattering lengths , @xmath17 , which are related to the free scattering length @xmath18 by @xmath19 here , @xmath20 is the mass of the neutron and @xmath21 is the mass of the atom . for hydrogen",
    ", @xmath18 is the linear combination of the singlet and the triplet scattering lengths given by , @xmath22 and for deuterium it is the linear combination of the doublet and quartet scattering lengths , @xmath23 these new measurements have uncertainties that are comparable to ( in n - p ) and smaller than ( in n - d ) previous results .",
    "d measurement yields a linear combination of the doublet and quartet scattering lengths and not the separate channel scattering lengths .",
    "there are good reasons however to have confidence that the doublet ( @xmath24s@xmath25 ) scattering length can be extracted from this measurement reliably with some help from theory . in the first place , the quartet @xmath26-wave scattering length ( @xmath27s@xmath28 ) can be unambiguously determined . because the three nucleons in this channel exist in a spin - symmetric state , and hence have an antisymmetric space - isospin wavefunction , the scattering in this state is completely determined by the long range part of the triplet @xmath26-wave nn interaction in the n - p channel ; i.e. by n - p scattering and the properties of the deuteron .",
    "furthermore , the use of multi - energy phase shift analysis , such as that conducted by black _ et al . _  in the p - d system@xcite , could allow one to extrapolate to the very low energy quartet phase shifts on the basis of data at higher energies .",
    "this is possible because , unlike the @xmath24s@xmath25 effective range function , the @xmath27s@xmath28 effective range function is free of singularities .",
    "therefore , one can independently predict the zero energy quartet @xmath26-wave scattering length @xmath29 both from fundamentally sound theory and from the totality of the sub - breakup n - d database .",
    "a high accuracy determination of the @xmath24s@xmath25 scattering length in the n - d system is of interest for a number of reasons .",
    "the pauli principle does not deter this channel from exploring the shorter - range components of the interaction , where 3n forces should appear , and the coulomb interaction is not present to complicate experiment or analysis .",
    "the n - d system is also in principle sensitive to charge symmetry breaking ( csb ) effects . due to charge symmetry breaking ,",
    "the n - p force and the n - n force are different .",
    "csb is explicitly included in modern nn potentials such as the argonne av18 potential .",
    "the accuracy in this observable that can be achieved in modern calculations is sufficient to be sensitive to csb .",
    "it was discovered in the early days of work on nuclear three - body systems that there is an empirical relation between the calculated doublet n - d scattering length and the binding energy of the tri - nucleon system . these so - called `` phillips lines '' @xcite",
    "have been shown to be strictly linear for the n - p system , ( in which case it is the triplet scattering length that is linked with the deuteron binding energy ) and they are approximately linear for n - d scattering . when phillips lines are plotted for the n - d calculations , the physical triton binding energy ( 8.48  mev ) intersects the currently accepted doublet value @xmath30  fm @xcite , in excellent agreement with the measurement of dilg _ et al . _  of @xmath31  fm @xcite .",
    "by contrast , a charge - symmetric r - matrix analysis of n - d data conducted by hale @xcite at energies up to the three - body breakup threshold gives the preliminary value @xmath32  fm , even though the dilg _",
    "et al._measurements were the only ones included in the n - d data set .",
    "these results , although preliminary , call into question the experimental values of the n - d scattering lengths , particularly in the doublet spin state . if the value of @xmath33 really is significantly less than 0.65  fm , then the presumably well - understood phenomenology of the phillips line is thrown into disarray .",
    "the current values of the n - d scattering lengths were determined by measurements performed almost 30  years ago using a neutron gravity reflectometer @xcite .",
    "these measurements were not performed using pure d@xmath34 gas samples because the experimental technique required samples in liquid or solid form : they were performed on d@xmath34o , sio@xmath35 and si from which the scattering length for n - d was deduced .",
    "this report describes the first high - precision measurement of the n - d coherent scattering length performed using a pure sample .",
    "in addition , we chose to pursue a precision measurement of the n - p coherent scattering length .",
    "the measurement of @xmath10 should yield a result that is consistent with the world average of other n - p measurements .",
    "if it does nt then we may have an unaccounted for systematic effect in our measurement .",
    "therefore the measurement of @xmath10 provides a secondary check on possible unknown systematic errors of our method .",
    "we use neutron interferometry to measure the coherent scattering lengths of these gases .",
    "interferometry measures a phase shift which is simply related to the coherent scattering length of the nuclei and is therefore sensitive to a particular linear combination of the scattering amplitudes in the two channels . from an experimental point of view , it is possible to measure this linear combination to much higher precision than one can determine the individual scattering lengths .",
    "for example , the coherent scattering length of silicon has been measured using neutron interferometry to the incredible accuracy of @xmath36  % , surely one of the most accurate measurements of a nuclear scattering amplitude ever performed@xcite .",
    "the experiment requires neither polarized beams nor polarized targets and is sensitive to the amplitude as opposed to the square of the amplitude that enters into cross section measurements .",

    "neutron optics is based on the existence of the `` coherent wave '' which is the coordinate representation of the coherent state formed by the incident wave and the forward scattered wave in a scattering medium .",
    "it is determined by the solution of a one - body schrodinger equation @xmath37\\psi(r)=e\\psi(r)\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the coherent wave and @xmath39 is the optical potential of the medium .",

    "one must make an approximation for the @xmath43 matrix of the neutron in a medium of scatterers .",

    "[ eq : fermiapprox ] we then arrive at an expression for the optical potential @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the number density of scatterers .",
    "the effect of the optical potential on the beam for a nonabsorbing uniform medium is to slow down the neutrons as they encounter the potential step due to the matter , thereby decreasing the neutron wave vector , _ k _ , within the medium .",
    "the neutron index of refraction is defined by this relative change in the magnitude of the wavevector @xmath55 .",
    "conservation of energy at the boundary determines the relation to the optical potential @xmath56    in general the scattering amplitude is complex to account for incoherent scattering and absorption of the wave amplitude .",

    "scattering length measurements were performed at the national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) center for neutron research ( ncnr ) interferometer and optics facility @xcite .",
    "this facility , situated on cold neutron guide seven ( ng7 ) , consists of a perfect crystal silicon neutron interferometer with high phase contrast ( @xmath69 ) and long - term phase stability ( @xmath70c per day ) . the single crystal interferometer is schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : interferometer ] . a monochromatic cold neutron beam ( @xmath71  mev , @xmath72  nm , @xmath73 ) is diffracted into the facility using a pair of pyrolytic graphite ( pg ) crystals operated in a non - dispersive double crystal mode using the ( 002 ) reflection .",
    "this beam is collimated and vertically focused onto the interferometer .",
    "the neutron beam is coherently divided in the splitter slab near point a by bragg diffraction into two beams that travel along paths @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",

    "two of the wave fields are coherently recombined to interfere in the third si mixer slab near point d. the perfect single crystal nature of the device ensures the required alignment precision which allows the bragg diffraction condition to be met by all three silicon slabs simultaneously .",
    "in addition , the narrow phase space acceptance of the device is an efficient filter for all incoherent neutron interactions in the silicon , phase shifter , and samples .",
    "the geometry traced out by this kind of interferometer is commonly referred to as mach - zehnder by analogy with similar optical interferometers . here",
    ", however , the splitter , mirror and mixer crystals have been machined from a monolithic si ingot in which the lower backbone maintains the perfect lattice registry of the original ingot .",
    "this avoids the mechanical difficulties associated with permanently aligning separated crystals to tolerances much less than the angular acceptance of a perfect crystal ( @xmath76rad ) .",

    "the relative intensities recorded for the two exit beams , called the o - beam and the h - beam here , depend upon the phase difference of the neutron waves traversing path @xmath75 relative to path @xmath74 . the phase shift that we measure is due to the phase difference of the neutron wave traversing path @xmath74 with the sample in this path relative to its phase with the sample removed .",
    "for the samples used in these measurements , the attenuation cross section does not significantly influence the real part of the refractive index .",
    "to very high accuracy , the phase shift due to the sample can be written as , @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the effective neutron optical thickness of the sample medium along the direction of wave propagation .",
    "thus , a measurement of the coherent scattering length @xmath17 to @xmath79  % absolute accuracy demands an absolute measurement of the following quantities at the @xmath80  % level :    \\(1 ) the neutron optical phase shift of the gas , @xmath81 ,    \\(2 ) the atom density @xmath82 ,    \\(3 ) the sample thickness @xmath78 , and    \\(4 ) the wavelength @xmath60 .",
    "in addition , it is necessary to verify the purity of the gas at the same level of accuracy . sections [ sect : phaseshiftmeas ] through  [ sect : wavelength ] discuss these measurements in detail .",
    "the phase shift , @xmath83 , is measured by a secondary sampling method in which a flat phase shifter plate ( denoted as the quartz phase flag in fig .",

    "if the cell was present in only one of the interferometer beams , a small unknown misalignment would lead to a large systematic uncertainty in the background phase shift . to minimize this systematic effect",

    "the scale of the correction is set by the ratio of the scattering length ( a few fm ) to the vibration amplitude of the atom ( 0.1  nm or so ) , which is small and typically neglected in neutron optics theory .",
    "however , since the size of this correction is a decreasing function of @xmath195 , it is largest for h and d. in the particular case of a bound proton the scattering amplitude becomes @xmath196\\ ] ] where @xmath197 and @xmath198 are the triplet and singlet n - p scattering lengths and the numerical factor of @xmath199 comes from evaluating the integral .",
    "the factor multiplying the expression is the usual coherent scattering length for hydrogen . for the particular case of hydrogen , where @xmath200  fm and @xmath201  fm , the size of the correction term is anomalously large from the small denominator , @xmath202 for a typical atomic oscillation amplitude of @xmath79  nm .",
    "however there is another effect of the same order of magnitude that must be taken into account associated with intraparticle multiple scattering . in eq .",
    "[ eq : tapprox ] the @xmath43 matrix of the bound system of @xmath82 scatterers is expressed as the sum of the ( impulse approximation ) one - body @xmath43 matrix .",
    "but this is known in exact treatments of scattering theory to be an approximation@xcite .",
    "the next order of approximation for the @xmath43 matrix of the system is @xmath203 where @xmath204 is the green s function .",
    "therefore the @xmath43 operator for the system to second order is not the sum of the @xmath43 operators for the individual particles due to interparticle multiple scattering .",
    "so to calculate the full @xmath43 operator of the system , which is what is required to obtain the optical potential in eq .",
    "[ eq : coherent ] one must take multiple scattering also into account",
    ". then finally the optical potential , which is now a function of the neutron momentum , must be solved from eq .",
    "[ eq : tmatrix ] and inserted into eq .",
    "[ eq : refractionindex ] .",
    "nowak@xcite performed this calculation to obtain the modified expression for the index of refraction @xmath205 and two correction terms at second order : one from the binding potential @xmath206 and the other from multiple scattering @xmath207\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath208 in these equations @xmath209 is the number density of scatterers , @xmath16 and @xmath210 are the wave vectors of the incident and in - medium neutrons ( very close to identical for cold neutrons ) , @xmath50 is the ( spin dependent ) scattering length operator of atom @xmath49 , and the averaging @xmath211 is the usual trace over spins and internal states of the scattering system .",
    "these expressions are related to ( but not identical with ) the well - known dynamic structure factors defined in the theory of thermal neutron scattering@xcite and make it clear that the second order approximation to the optical potential is a function of the dynamics and correlations of the scattering medium .    from this expression",
    "we can understand why the multiple scattering correction to the optical potential is especially large for the case of h and d gas molecules and much smaller for hydrogen atoms embedded in the large polyatomic molecules that have been used for the most precise n - p and n - d coherent scattering length measurements in past work in liquid .",
    "first of all , the multiple scattering term @xmath212 vanishes if the nuclei in the polyatomic molecule possess uncorrelated nuclear spin directions and uncorrelated relative motions , which is true to an excellent approximation . from a physical point of view , multiple scattering from uncorrelated nuclei can not contribute to coherent scattering .",
    "by contrast , as is well - known , the spins of hydrogen and deuterium molecules are tightly correlated as a result of the identical particle constraints , and the relative motions are perfectly correlated for isolated molecules by the conservation of momentum",
    ". therefore the multiple scattering correction will be much larger for h and d molecules than for larger polyatomic molecules .",
    "in addition , one can see that the size of this effect will be larger for hydrogen than for deuterium .",
    "in addition to the effect of the larger mass , deuterium has a smaller ratio of incoherent to coherent scattering , and as one can see from eq .",
    "[ eq : hydrocorrection ] the effect is proportional to this ratio , which is anomalously large for hydrogen .    the expression for the dynamic structure factor in the corrections calculated by nowak can be evaluated exactly for hydrogen and deuterium gas in thermal equilibrium in the rigid rotor approximation.@xcite the calculation draws on the work of young and koppel@xcite on the dynamic structure factor for neutron scattering from hydrogen and deuterium molecules .",
    "the rigid rotor approximation is known to be an excellent approximation for slow neutron scattering in hydrogen and deuterium .",
    "since the neutron energy is too low to excite the first vibrational level only transitions to rotational states need to be taken into account .",
    "these detailed calculations are presently in progress .",
    "we consulted the existing compilations of previous measurements@xcite for which we found the measurements of the coherent scattering length of hydrogen @xcite and deuterium@xcite .",
    "we excluded all measurements that were not published in a refereed journal and all measurements that were later retracted for hydrogen@xcite and for deuterium@xcite with the exception of ref .",
    "@xcite , which updates a previous value reported in ref .",
    "@xcite for isotopic purity . although the result of bartolini _",
    "et al._@xcite was never formally withdrawn it was excluded here due to the fact that the result was @xmath213 from the world average . the value quoted by bartolini _ et al._@xcite was due to a reanalysis of the h@xmath35o content of the sample used 4 years prior in ref .",
    "this large discrepancy was also discussed by dilg _",
    "et al._@xcite , and nistler @xcite who found this result to be inconsistent .",
    "in addition , there were two measurements of the ratio of the bound coherent scattering lengths of hydrogen and carbon whose originally reported uncertainties could be lowered by a factor of 2 as a result of subsequent precision measurements of the bound coherent scattering length of carbon , which is now known to be @xmath214  fm@xcite . including this new value for @xmath215 with the measurement of dickinson _",
    "et al._@xcite of @xmath216  fm gives @xmath217  fm for which permission was obtained from one of the coauthors @xcite to modify the original published result ( original value : @xmath218  fm ) .",
    "however permission was not obtained to modify the measurement of burgy _",
    "et al._@xcite . without permission to modify this result",
    "we will only state the result here of how the new value of @xmath215 affects the published value for @xmath169 , but this updated value will not be used in the calculation of the average value of @xmath219 . from the measurement of burgy _",
    "et al._@xcite @xmath220  fm gives @xmath221  fm ( original value : @xmath222  fm .",
    "note that burgy _",
    "et al._reported the ratio of the atomic scattering lengths as opposed to the nuclear scattering lengths : we have converted their ratio into a ratio of nuclear scattering lengths using the expression @xmath223  fm  is the neutron - electron scattering length@xcite .    to calculate an average of all previous measurements we have followed the following procedure given by hagiwara _ et al _ @xcite",
    "the data was combined into an average with results weighted inversely with the size of their ( @xmath224 ) uncertainties .",
    "the result of this evaluation is @xmath2  fm  and @xmath3  fm .",
    "the reduced chi square , @xmath225 , of the average value for h is 3.6 and for d is 0.7 . since the @xmath225 for h is greater than 1 we chose to scale up the uncertainty by @xmath226 based on the method of hagiwara _ et al _ @xcite .",
