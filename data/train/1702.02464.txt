    "it has been known that the observed number density of satellite galaxies in the local group and our own milky way is orders of magnitude lower than the predictions from the cosmological simulations , the so - called ` missing satellite problem ' @xcite .",
    "one of the popular solutions to this problem is that low - mass halos fail to form stars efficiently such that they are below the detection limit of most imaging surveys . under this paradigm , ` dark ' galaxies are gas - rich galaxies that do not emit sufficient optical light due to their low efficiency in forming stars , but are thought to be building blocks of normal star - forming galaxies .",
    "this type of galaxy is an ideal laboratory to study early stages of star formation , which could lead to understanding how the star formation is triggered .",
    "it is in general very difficult to identify dark galaxies since they are extremely faint in the optical .",
    "very few dark candidates have been identified and confirmed to date .",
    "the alfalfa ( arecibo legacy fast alfa ) hi survey @xcite has discovered on the order of @xmath5 hi sources not associated with apparent optical counterparts , but most of them are likely to have tidal origins @xcite .",
    "a pilot study suggested that none of remaining objects they have explored is a dark galaxy after cross - checking with data in other wavelengths @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite have identified a new class of low surface brightness ( lsb ) dwarf galaxies in the coma cluster , often referred to as ` ultra - diffuse ' galaxies ( udgs ) , using the dragonfly telescope array @xcite .",
    "these udgs not only have a low surface brightness ( 24  26 mag arcsec@xmath2 ) , but also show extended structures with size comparable to @xmath6 galaxies . although these udgs are found in special environments and may not necessarily represent the global dwarf population , the discovery of this type of galaxy suggests we might have missed numerous faint dwarfs due to observation limitations in the past .",
    "in addition to the aforementioned efforts , the optical integral field unit ( ifu ) observations open a plausible window to probe the dwarf populations .",
    "normally , emission lines ionized by star - forming regions , agns , or shocks are stronger than the stellar continuum and hence can be easily detected with reasonable integration time . with the large area covered by ifu",
    ", the structures of ionized gas can be probed out to several tens of kpc .",
    "isolated ionized gases that are separate from a nearby galaxy or a quasar have been readily studied in ifu as well as spectroscopic observations @xcite .",
    "although the majority of those ionized gas are suggested or inferred to have external origins , such as the result of gas accretion or minor mergers , their nature remains unknown .",
    "here we report the discovery of a giant  blob which does not have any optical counterpart in deep cfht @xmath7 images .",
    "however , the morphology and emission line analyses suggest that it could either be ejected gas due to past agn activity or a special type of udgs ( or ` dark ' galaxies ) . in  2 , we describe the multi - wavelength data for this system .",

    "as shown in the panel ( b ) of figure [ fig : song ] , they have been removed smoothly from the input image without any significant residual pattern . using this",
    "`` cleaned '' image as input , we model the two merging galaxies along with their `` common envelope '' together using different combinations of components .",
    "we started with three components ( one for each galaxy , additional one for the envelope ) , and gradually build up the complexity by adding more component .",
    "as we simply want to achieve smooth residual map to study the underlying structure , the number of the components and the detailed parameters are not a concern as long as each component behaves normally ( e.g. gu  et al .",

    "( including the envelope ) , all components are constrained to have the same center , and only symmetric components are used here . after visualizing the residual of initial model ,",
    "it becomes clear that , on the lower part of the image , there is an additional surface brightness enhancement ( caused by the merging process ) that are not well fit by the simple model .",

    "both of the merging galaxies , and the extended envelope are described by 2 components ; while the surface brightness in the south is modelled using single component .",

    "will not affect the above conclusion .",
    "adding more components could not further improve the residual map , but results in ill - behaved components .",

    "figure [ fig : velocity ] displays the velocity and dispersion maps for this system . while the stellar velocity field indicates that the main galaxy satsuki is primarily pressure supported , the gas component reveals more complex structures .",
    "the central galaxy shows a weak rotation structure , while there is strong variation in the line - of - sight velocity across totoro region , redshifted in the left tail and blueshifted in the right tail .",
    "the inconsistent velocity fields between stars and gas suggests that some part of the gas of satsuki might have been either accreted or ejected recently . in the former case , it is similar to those early - type galaxies that exhibit misaligned gas and stellar kinematics , the so - called early - type ` counter rotators ' @xcite , although counter rotators in general are defined for systems with a rotating stellar component .",
    "the gas inflow scenario is also consistent with the  morphology which shows bridge ( tail)-like structures that connect totoro and satsuki . on the other hand , the complicated velocity field can also be explained if the main galaxy satsuki underwent a strong outburst phase , during which totoro was expelled from satuski .",

    "the multiple line detections also allow us to classify the emission line regions into hii or agn regimes using the standard baldwin - phillips - terlevich ( bpt baldwin , phillips & terlevich 1981 ; veilleux & osterbrock 1987 ; kauffmann et al .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to separate various regions .",
    "all the three classifications indicate ` liner'-type excitations for satsuki .",
    "as the liner emission is extended across the entire main galaxy , this object falls in to the extended lier ( elier ) category according to the classification scheme by @xcite    on the other hand , in the regions of totoro , the line ratios are consistent with the ` composite ' , ` hi ' . and liner regions when using the [ nii ] , [ sii ] , and [ oi ] diagnostics , respectively .",
    "in the remaining part of this paper , we treat totoro as ` composite ' regions based on the [ nii ] , as it allows for the intermediate excitation state as opposed to the other two methods .",
    "to further understand the properties of totoro , we also measure the gas - phase metallicity ( z ) for this system .",
    "conventionally , there are many ways to estimate the gas metallicity through emission line ratios ( see * ? ? ?",
    ". however , most of those tracers are calibrated against the hii regions , and may not be applicable to systems with ionization parameters or interstellar medium ( ism ) pressure different from typical hii regions . here",
    ", we adopt the ` n2s2 '   calibrator that is suggested to be less sensitive to the ionization parameters @xcite to estimate the metallicity .",

    "the [ nii ] to [ sii ] ratio is found to nearly independent of the agn luminosity and hence provides a good metallicity indicator for even agns @xcite .",
    "however , we note with caution that the derived metallicity may still be subject to large systematic uncertainty since the line ratios of the main galaxy and totoro are located in the liner and composite regions , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig : metal ] shows the z(n2s2 ) map for this system .",
    "the metallicity of the gas around satsuki is close to solar and is @xmath1 0.3 dex lower than the expected value ( z = 9.1 ) for a massive galaxy with a stellar mass of @xmath41   based on the local mass  metallicity relation @xcite .",
    "the offset we see here , however , may be easily accounted for by the different metallicity calibrators adopted . on the other hand ,",
    "the averaged metallicity in the   region is greater for totoro than satsuki by a factor of 0.3 dex and is more consistent with the gas metalltcity of high mass galaxies .",
    "although the difference is significantly larger than the statistical uncertainty ( 0.03 - 0.1 dex ) in the metallicity measurement , it is difficult to interpret this result given the systematic uncertainty in the metallicity measurement due to their different ionization states .",
    "the environment of this system is rather complex .",
    "as already mentioned , it has an early - type companion ( mei ) just 4 kpc away to the south , which makes them a possible dry merger candidate .",
    "moreover , satsuki is also part of the system mcg+10 + 24 - 117 , a small group falling onto a galaxy cluster with ngc 6338 as a central brightest cluster galaxy that is 43 kpc away to the south ( see figure [ fig : cfht ] ; pandge et al .",

    "this object , however , does not have any optical counterparts down to 26.9 mag arcsec@xmath2 in deep cfht / megacam @xmath42 , and @xmath22 images .",
    "there are several possible scenarios to explain the origins of totoro :    scenario 1 : totoro is associated with gas tidally stripped from satsuki during the interaction between satsuki and mei .",
    "scenario 2 : totoro is associated with the gas ram - pressure stripped during the infall of satsuki toward the center of ngc 6338 galaxy cluster , similar to ngc4569 located in the virgo cluster ( boselli et al .",
    "2016 ) .",
    "scenario 3 : totoro is associated with gas ejected from satsuki by an agn outflow during the mergers between satsuki and mei . if the central black hole of satsuki is turned on during mergers , the energy can ionize the stripped gas , resulting in the  emissions , similar to the known ` hanny s voorwerp ' phenomenon ( lintott et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "scenario 4 : totoro is an udg ( or alternatively , a lsb galaxy ) , which falls below the detection limit ( 26.9 mag arcsec@xmath2 in @xmath21-band ) of cfht imaging data , making it a ` dark ' galaxy .",
    "the morphology of totoro ( figure 1 ) , especially the ( tail ) bridge - like structures that connect between satsuki and totoro , indicates that satsuki is likely under interaction with the hosting galaxy of totoro , which has a comparable physical size as satsuki .    to estimate the mass of the warm gas component ,",
    "we follow the approach adopted by @xcite .",
    "we first estimate the electron density @xmath43 to be @xmath1 260 @xmath44 based on the median value of the [ sii]6717/[sii]6731 ratio in the region of totoro following equation 3 of @xcite , which assumes the electron temperature @xmath45 .",
    "next , we calculate the extinction - corrected  luminosity , @xmath46 , to be 3.1@xmath47 erg s@xmath10 . the ionized gas mass can then be derived using the following equation @xcite : @xmath48 we obtain the ionized gas mass @xmath1 8.2@xmath32 10@xmath49 .",
    "the hi observation of this system provides an upper limit of ( 8.99.2 ) @xmath35  for the hi mass due to the null detection .",
    "we account for he gas by applying a factor of 1.33 to this upper limit",
    ". we can also infer the h@xmath50 content of this totoro using the  emission .",
    "the integrated  flux over spaxels within totoro region is 3.3@xmath51 erg s@xmath10 cm@xmath2 , corresponding to a luminosity of 7.8@xmath47 erg s@xmath10 .",
    "assuming all the  flux results from star formation , we obtain the total star formation rate ( sfr ) of totoro to be 0.059yr@xmath10 using the conversion between the  luminosity and star formation rate from @xcite .",
    "we then estimate the total h@xmath53 gas mass ( = sfr x t@xmath54 ) of the h@xmath31 blob to be @xmath55 assuming a typical gas depletion time ( t@xmath54 ) of 2 gyr .",
    "this value is also an upper limit since we have assumed that all the  fluxes are contributed by the star formation .",
    "this implies an upper limit of the entire cold gas ( hi + he + h@xmath50 ) of @xmath1 1.3 @xmath56 .",
    "although satsuki and its companion mei are consistent with being early - type galaxies ( etgs ) , the amount of the cold gas in totoro is not totally unexpected if it is part of satsuki . for example",
    ", recent works have found that a significant fraction of massive etgs that show signs of star formation possess cold gas with gas mass comparable to this totoro @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to speculate that totoro may originally be part ( if not all ) of the cold gas contained satsuki , and then get ejected during the galaxy - galaxy interaction or because of the ram - pressure stripping ( scenarios 1 to 3 , respectively ) .    to test the galaxy interaction scenario ( scenario 1 ) , we have performed and examined a set of n - body simulations of the interaction of two elliptical galaxies ( e - e ) with the code gadget2 ( springel 2005 ) . different initial orbital configurations ( e.g pericentric distance ) have been considered in a similar way to peirani et al .",
    "although we did not include any gas component in our dry merger simulations , the features in the stellar components can still be useful to understand the system as the stellar streams well trace the gas streams before 1 gyr during galaxy interaction .    among all the cases we have looked at",
    ", we did not see the formation of any clear stellar stream or a centrally concentrated blob - like structures during the interaction .",
    "this strongly suggested that totoro is unlikely to be produced during an e - e interaction .",
    "in addition , based on other existing gas - rich merger simulations ( see for instance barnes & hernquist 1996 ; di matteo et al .",
    "2007 ; peirani et al . 2010 ) , the prominent gas ( or stellar ) streams are expected to be formed when at least one of merger progenitors have extended disk structures , unlikely to be the case for this dry merger system even if these two ellipticals have small amount of gas . furthermore , such latter simulations also suggest that it is very difficult to produce such blob - like structure .",
    "although tidal dwarf galaxies can be formed during the interaction of disk galaxies ( see for instance bournaud , duc et masset 2003 ; duc , bournaud et masset 2004 ) in these cases , the blob - like structure is more extended with no clear star formation activity .",
    "nevertheless , we note that the simulations we have examined have the following caveats : 1 ) the possible parameter space is extensive , so it is impossible to fully explore , and 2 ) the stellar / agn feedback which could drive galactic scale outflows and these physics are not included .",
    "such advanced simulations are beyond the scope of this work .",
    "we defer more detailed comparisons with simulations to a future work .",
    "on the other hand , the centrally concentrated blob - like structure is not expected in the ram - pressure stripped gas ( scenario 2 ) , either , which often shows the tail and/or ` jellyfish ' like structures ( e.g. , boselli et al .",
    "moreover , galaxies that show ram - pressure stripping phenomena are mostly gas - rich late - type galaxies , unlike satsuki .",
    "another explanation for totoro is the materials ejected by an agn located in satsuki ( scenario 3 ) , similar to the extended emission - line regions found around quasars @xcite .",
    "the outflow scenario is also consistent with the complicated velocity field seen in the gas component of this system . on the other hand ,",
    "as discussed in  2 , we do not detect an x - ray point source or an extended radio jet in the main galaxy , suggesting that there is no on - going strong agn activity .",
    "however , it has been known that the agn brightness can vary over timescales of several to 10@xmath57 years @xcite , either due to a change in the black - hole accretion rate or tidal - disruption events ( tdes , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , we can not rule out the possibility of a recent past agn outflow , similar to the notable phenomena of henny s voorwerp , in which the ionizing source has already diminished whereas a clump of ionized gas is found several kpc away .",
    "nevertheless , it is unclear why the ejected gas would have a higher metallicity than than the gas remaining in satsuki ( although it is unclear whether the metallicity difference is real given the potential systematics in our metallicity estimate ) .",
    "an alternative explanation of the  blob is a separate faint galaxy , interacting with the dry merger system ( scenario 4 ) .",
    "a few morphological features , for example , the centrally concentrated  and the bridges extended from totoro toward satsuki , are most consistent with totoro being a separated gas component . according to numerical simulations , these features can indeed be explained by the interaction between the main galaxy and a faint disk galaxy ( scenario 1 ) ( see for instance , peirani et al .",
    "2010 ; cheung et al . 2016 ) .",
    "recently , a class of udgs has been identified in the coma cluster and several low - redshift clusters @xcite .",
    "these udgs are surprising large in size ( @xmath58 = 1.5  4.6 kpc ) despite of their low stellar masses ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "the majority of these udgs are found to lie on the red - sequence , indicating old stellar populations and quenched star formation activities @xcite .",
    "possible formation mechanisms include that gas is stripped by the ram pressure when falling into the cluster , which prevents subsequent star formation , or that gas is expelled due to strong stellar or supernova feedback for galaxies with halo mass between @xmath60@xmath41  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it remains an open question regarding the origin of udgs and whether these udgs are already quenched before falling into the cluster environments .",
    "totoro identified in this work has a comparable size ( @xmath1 3.2 kpc ) as the udgs .",
    "however , the averaged surface brightness of totoro has an upper limit of 26.9 mag arcsec@xmath2 , at least 1 - 3 mag dimmer compared to that of the known udgs ranging from 24 to 26 mag arcsec@xmath2 .",
    "another aspect of totoro that is distinct from the known udgs is that the latter are generally old in the stellar populations as indicated from their red colors , whereas totoro shown in this work is likely to have small amount of on - going star formation based on the bpt diagnostics but with little old stellar populations .",
    "therefore , totoro may represent a different category of lsb galaxy from the quiescent udgs .",
    "the non - detection of optical light associated with totoro can provide an upper limit of the amount of star formation . assuming that this  cloud is a young star - forming system with age @xmath61 gyr , the flux in the optical regime is expected to be comparable to that in the uv ( 15002800  ) in the case of no dust extinction .",
    "following the conversion between the uv luminosity ,  luminosity , and the star formation rate given by @xcite and adopt the surface brightness limit ( 26.9 mag arcsec@xmath2 ) from our cfht megacam @xmath62band observation , we estimate that the corresponding  surface density of this totoro is on the order of 1.1 @xmath63erg s@xmath10 cm@xmath10 arcsec@xmath2 , which is one magnitude lower than the peak value of totoro . by integrating it over the  region",
    ", we estimate that the star formation contributes less than 37% to the total  flux , otherwise we should be able to detect the optical counterpart",
    ".    given the very low amount of star formation that can possibly occur in totoro , we speculate that totoro is a gas cloud that fails to form stars efficiently , and thus a ` dark ' gas cloud .",
    "the origin of this gas cloud , whether it is associated with a satellite dark matter , or a pure gas cloud , is difficult to pin down .",
    "however , the latter scenario is unlikely since it would be difficult to maintain the kpc - scale gas cloud against gravity without invoking the existence of a dark matter halo .",
    "if totoro is indeed hosted by a subhalo , it would be a strong evidence of the existence of ` dark ' subhalos , which help to alleviate the missing satellite problem .",
    "since there is no stellar component in the region of totoro , we could roughly estimate the halo mass of totoro based on the gas velocity dispersion using the virial theorem .",
    "taking r = 3.2 kpc and @xmath65 , we obtain the halo mass m@xmath66 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the high metallicity of totoro ( see section 3.4 ) is unexpected for a typical dwarf galaxy .",
    "one possible explanation is that the gas cloud has been enriched by the surrounding environment , and may has a different evolution process from the typical known dwarf galaxies .",
    "however , we caution that the metallicity measurement presented in this work is subject to large uncertainty since the ionization source is not well constrained .",

    ", the gas velocity dispersion ( @xmath75 ) is expected to be as high as several hundreds of . as revealed in figure [ fig : velocity ] , @xmath75 in the region of totoro is @xmath76 .",
    "although it is close to the lower end of velocity dispersion distribution that have been found in typical shocked regions , we can not ruled out the shock excitation of the emission lines . to gain insights to whether shock is responsible for producing the ionized ratios seen in this system",
    ", we show the shock and photoionization mixing models from @xcite as blue curves in the upper panels of figure [ fig : bpt ] .",
    "these models are produced based on the ` mappings iv code ` @xcite and span a wide range of shock fractions ( from 20% to 100% ) and shock velocities ( from 100 to 300 ) .",
    "as it can be seen , the models predict a greater /  ratio than what is observed in the data and do not cover the majority of the regions occupied by the data points even at shock velocity up to @xmath77 .",
    "in addition to the pure shock models , we also compare the data to the shock + precursor models of allen et al .",
    "( 2008 ) with @xmath78 = 1 @xmath44 and solar metallicity , shown as the gray grid in figure [ fig : bpt ] .",
    "although the grid starts with the shock velocity of 200 , it is expected by extrapolation that models with lower velocity values still can not reproduce the [ nii]/  ratios of totoro .",
    "these comparisons suggest that shocks are unlikely to be the dominant mechanism that is responsible for ionizing the gas blob .",
    "there have been studies showing that agn is able to ionize gas clouds extending to several kpc @xcite , and the effect from agn may persist even @xmath79yr after the central engines shut off ( e.g. , the  hanny s voorewerp  ; * ? ? ?",
    "if totoro is indeed a ` dark ' galaxy or a cloud interacting with satsuki , the tidal field would cause a gas inflow that fuels the central black hole of satsuki and possibly trigger the agn activity . although no x - ray point source is detected in the position of either satsuki or totoro , the detection of point - like radio source ( see sec .",
    "2.3 ) in the center of satsuki indicates the presence of a low - activity agn .",
    "therefore , an alternative explanation for the line ratios seen in totoro is due to the star formation  agn mixing effect @xcite .",
    "observationally a starburst  agn mixing sequence is often found in starbursting galaxy that hosts a central agn , in which case the line ratio moves from seyfert to composite to hii regions as the distance from the central agn increases .",
    "the position of line ratios depends on the fractional contribution between agn and star formation .",
    "according to the mixing model by @xcite , when the star - forming cloud is photonionized by an agn , the line ratios can fall into the ` composite ' region on bpt diagrams . in the case of 100% contribution from agn ,",
    "the emission line ratio falls into the ` agn ' region , instead of ` composite ' region where totoro lies .",
    "this implies that the emission line ratios seen in totoro can not be fully attributed to pure agn photonionization , and some level of star formation may be required . unlike the typical star formation ",
    "agn mixing @xcite , our case is analogous to the star formation  liner sequence ,",
    "in which the liner excitation is due to the low - activity agn located in satsuki .",
    "there are several similar systems reported in the literature that show offset ionized gas components , and hence it is intriguing to compare this totoro with previous cases .",
    "for example , the famous hanny s voorewerp @xcite , also exhibits a separate warm gas component that is offset from the main galaxy by several kpc .",
    "however , there are several different features between hanny s voorewerp and totoro presented in this work .",
    "first , the ionized gas of hanny s voorewerp has much higher excitation state and its line ratios are consistent with seyfert , as opposed to the ` composite ' region for totoro .",
    "moreover , the  morphology of the hanny s voorewerp is lumpy and irregular , unlike a disk - like structure seen in our case .",
    "another well - known example is an  emission line component ( often referred as the ` cap ' ) at a projected distance of 11 kpc northwest of m82 @xcite .",
    "the cap has a shell - like structure and may possibly be bow shock formed by the starburst - driven superwind . in both cases , the nearby galaxy is a late - type star forming galaxy , different from satsuki , which is an early - type galaxy .",
    "totoro may thus represent a different category of offset ionized gas in nearby galaxies .",
    "here we report a discovery of a puzzling giant  blob , totoro , identified from the first - year manga data .",
    "the data disfavor the scenario that totoro is tidally - stripped gas from manga 1 - 24145 ( satsuki ) that is interacting with the southern companion ( mei ) , or the ram - pressure stripped gas when satsuki falls into the center of the cluster it is located . despite there being no x - ray point source or radio jet detected in this system , we can not rule out the possibility that totoro is ejected from a past agn activity in satsuki , which likely hosts a faint agn given its radio luminosity . on the other hand ,",
    "the  morphology and the lack of stellar tidal streams suggest that totoro could also be a separate ` dark ' galaxy ( or an extremely lsb galaxy ) interacting with satsuki .",
    "the non - detection of the stellar continuum suggests totoro is different from known dwarf populations or udgs : it is either completely ` dark ' or with a star formation rate that contributes @xmath80 of the  flux .    as for the source that powers the line excitation for totoro , the ` composite ' line excitation can be explained either by a star - forming cloud being excited by a low - velocity shock or by the star formation  liner mixing effect .",
    "the shock scenario , however , is less favoured because of the low velocity dispersion observed in totoro region .",
    "the decrease in the /  ratio away from satsuki indicates that the ionizing source is possibly located inside satsuki .",
    "thus , the star formation  liner mixing effect seems to be the most probable ionizing mechanism . in this scenario ,",
    "the hypothesis is that the ionizing source is the low - activity agn residing in satsuki , being triggered by the gas inflow induced during the interaction between satsuki and the ` dark ' galaxy ( or gas cloud ) .",
    "the agn subsequently photoionizes the ` dark ' gas cloud , which then emits the  photons .    however , we have not considered the case where totoro is tidally - stripped from satsuki while falling into the cluster center at the same time , which results in the non - typical tidally or ram - pressure stripped gas morphology of totoro .",
    "more sophisticated modelling considering both the effects of tidal disrupting and the orbital motions of satsuki relative to the cluster environments , as well as future resolved atomic and molecular gas observations , such as hi and co , are required to further understand the origin of totoro .",

    "<S> we report the discovery of a mysterious giant  blob that is @xmath0 kpc away from the main manga target 1 - 24145 , one component of a dry galaxy merger , identified in the first - year sdss - iv manga data . </S>",
    "<S> the size of the  blob is @xmath1 3 - 4 kpc in radius , and the  distribution is centrally concentrated . </S>",
    "<S> however , there is no optical continuum counterpart in deep broadband images reaching @xmath126.9 mag arcsec@xmath2 in surface brightness . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate that the masses of ionized and cold gases are @xmath3  and @xmath4 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the emission - line ratios indicate that the  blob is photoionized by a combination of massive young stars and agn . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the ionization line ratio decreases from manga 1 - 24145 to the  blob , suggesting that the primary ionizing source may come from manga 1 - 24145 , likely a low - activity agn . </S>",
    "<S> possible explanations of this  blob include agn outflow , the gas remnant being tidally or ram - pressure stripped from manga 1 - 24145 , or an extremely low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxy . however , the stripping scenario is less favoured according to galaxy merger simulations and the morphology of the  blob . with the current data , we can not distinguish whether this  blob is ejected gas due to a past agn outburst , or a special category of ` ultra - diffuse galaxy ' ( udg ) interacting with manga 1 - 24145 that further induces the gas inflow to fuel the agn in manga 1 - 24145 . </S>"
