    "this and computational data led them to believe that the @xmath14-th coefficient does not depend on @xmath12 so long as @xmath15 .",
    "the goal of this paper is to prove this conjecture for all alternating links .",
    "it is also known that this property of @xmath0 does not hold for all knots . in @xcite , with oliver dasbach , we examined the case of the @xmath16 torus knot for which this property fails .    for two laurent series @xmath17 and @xmath18",

    "another way of phrasing the above definition is that @xmath28 if and only if their first @xmath29 coefficients agree up to sign .    in @xcite we defined two power series , the head and tail of the colored jones polynomial @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",

    "given a link diagram @xmath50 there are two ways to smooth each crossing , described in figure [ smoothings ] . a state of the diagram is a choice of smoothing for each crossing .",
    "two states are particularly important when dealing with the colored jones polynomial ; they are the all - a state @xmath51 and the all - b state @xmath52 .",
    "the all - a ( respectively all - b ) state is the state for which the a ( b ) smoothing is choosen for every crossing .    for a state @xmath53",
    "we can build a graph @xmath54 called the state graph for @xmath53 .",
    "the graph @xmath54 has vertices the circles in @xmath53 , and edges the crossings in @xmath50 .",
    "each edge connects the two vertices corresponding to the two circles that the crossing meets .",
    "a link diagram is a - adequate ( b - adequate ) if the state graph for @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) has no loops .",
    "a link diagram is adequate if it is both a and b - adequate .",
    "a link is adequate if it has an adequate diagram .",
    "the most important property of a - adequate diagrams is that the number of circles in @xmath51 is a local maximum . in other words ,",

    "another important fact about adequate diagrams is that parallels of a - adequate diagrams are also a - adequate diagrams . given a diagram @xmath50 , the @xmath56-th parallel of @xmath50 denoted @xmath57 is the diagram formed by replacing @xmath50 with @xmath56 parallel copies of @xmath50 .      for a more detailed explanation of skein theory ,",

    "[ idem ] if @xmath63 , then @xmath69 is at least twice the minimum word length of @xmath60 in terms of the @xmath70 s .",
    "this follows easily from the recursive definition of the idempotent by an inductive argument .",
    "the only issue is that terms of the form @xmath71 \\draw ( 0,0 ) node[right]{\\small{n}}--(0,1 ) node[left]{\\scriptsize{n-1 } } --(0,2 ) node[right]{\\small{n } } ; \\draw[ultra thick , fill = white ] ( -0.2 , 0.5 ) rectangle ( 0.4 , 0.65 ) ;   \\draw ( 0.2 , 0.65 ) arc ( 180:0:0.25 ) ; \\draw ( 0.7,0 ) node[right]{1}--(0.7 , 0.65 ) ; \\draw[ultra thick , fill = white ] ( -0.2 , 1.5 ) rectangle ( 0.4 , 1.35 ) ;   \\draw ( 0.2 , 1.35 ) arc ( -180:0:0.25 ) ; \\draw ( 0.7,2 ) node [ right]{\\small{1 } } --(0.7 , 1.35 ) ; \\end{tikzpicture}$ ] may have a circle which needs to be removed .",
    "in this situation , the minimum degree of the coefficient is reduced by two , but the number of generators used is also reduced by one .",
    "using lemma [ idem ] we can find a lower bound for the minimum degree of any element of @xmath72 which contains the jones - wenzl idempotent . before we do this , consider a crossing - less diagram @xmath53 in the plane consisting of arcs connecting jones - wenzl idempotents .",
    "we will define what it means for such a diagram to be adequate in much the same way that a knot diagram can be a or b- adequate .    construct a crossing - less diagram @xmath73 from @xmath53 by replacing each of the jones - wenzl idempotents in @xmath53 by the identity of @xmath74 .",
    "thus @xmath73 is a collection of circles with no crossings .",

    "if @xmath53 is adequate , then the number of circles in @xmath73 is a local maximum , in the sense that if the idempotents in @xmath53 are replaced by other elements of @xmath67 such that there is exactly one hook total in all of the replacements , then the number of circles in this diagram is one less than the number of circles in @xmath73 .",

    ", then there will be a hook somewhere in the diagram . by removing a single hook",
    ", we get a different term @xmath81 in the expansion .",
    "the number of circles in @xmath80 differs from the number of circles in @xmath81 by exactly one .",
    "also there are fewer hooks in @xmath81 ,",
    "so by lemma [ idem ] and the fact that removing a circle results in multiplying by @xmath82 , the minimum degree of @xmath80 is at least as large as the minimum degree of @xmath81 .",
    "this tells us that the lowest degree amongst terms in the expansion of @xmath53 is the degree of the term with the idempotents replaced by the identity , @xmath73 .",
    "if @xmath53 is adequate , then for any term @xmath80 with only a single hook , @xmath81 will be @xmath73 , and thus @xmath81 will have one more circle than @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , @xmath83 .",
    "this tells us that any term @xmath84 in this expansion will have @xmath83 , and thus @xmath85 .",
    "if there were crossings in @xmath53 , then we can get an expansion of @xmath53 by expanding the idempotents that appear in @xmath53 and summing over all possible smoothings of the crossings .",
    "if we expand over the smoothings first , we get a collection of terms each of which is a coefficient times a crossingless diagram with idempotents .",
    "we can apply the previous argument to say that the minimum degree of each term is the minimum degree of that term with the idempotents replaced with the identity .",
    "now consider @xmath73 . by expanding @xmath73 by summing over all possible smoothings of @xmath73",
