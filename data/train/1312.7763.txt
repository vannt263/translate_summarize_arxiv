    "for slow particles decoupling from an ideal fluid , it was found that eq .",
    "( [ p.u_slow ] ) leads to the remarkable property that the particle distribution resulting from the cooper ",
    "frye prescription is simply ( the degeneracy factor times ) a function of mass multiplying a species - independent function of the particle transverse velocity @xmath33 , azimuth @xmath27 , and rapidity @xmath2  @xcite : @xmath42 as a consequence , the particle spectra for different species , plotted vs.  @xmath33 at a given rapidity , should only differ by a normalisation factor .",
    "expanding the particle distribution in fourier series of the azimuthal angle , the fourier coefficients @xmath43 should be identical for different species of slow particles .",
    "plotting as a function of transverse momentum @xmath1 , instead of transverse velocity , one finds the so - called `` mass ordering '' of the flow coefficients , with @xmath44 being smaller for heavier particles  thanks to the fact that @xmath20 is a monotonously increasing function of transverse momentum .    as we shall show next , these generic features  namely transverse momentum spectra as product of a particle type dependent coefficient and a universal function of the particle velocity and anisotropic flow coefficients depending only on @xmath33 and @xmath2actually persist for slow particles decoupling from a dissipative fluid , at least as far as first - order or conformal second - order effects are concerned .",
    "note , however , that the prefactors @xmath45 and the shape of the species - independent function @xmath46 do depend on the form of the dissipative corrections .    to see that the latter still lead to a functional dependence of the type  ( [ slow : scaling_law ] ) , we have to inspect the form of the dissipative corrections at freeze out more closely",
    ".    consider first the correction accounting for shear viscous effects .",
    "this contribution contains at least a multiplicative factor @xmath47 , with @xmath48 the shear stress tensor . for our discussion ,",
    "the latter possesses the important property that it is orthogonal to the fluid velocity , @xmath49 . as we have seen above , the saddle point for slow particles is such that @xmath35 , which yields at once @xmath50 thus , the additive correction at decoupling from shear viscosity vanishes for slow particles in the saddle - point approximation .",

    ", the bulk pressure at freeze out only includes the expansion rate @xmath56 , taken at the same ( saddle ) point for particles having the same transverse velocity .",
    "again , one finds that the particle distribution depends on momentum only through the variables @xmath33 , @xmath2 , and @xmath27 , so that the conclusions found for the freeze out from an ideal fluid remain valid , albeit with modified factors @xmath45 and shape @xmath57 .",
    "conformal second - order corrections to the phase space distribution of slow particles can be handled in the same way as the shear or bulk viscous terms above .",
    "consider thus eq .",
    "( [ df2_teaney - yan ] ) in appendix  [ app : teaney - yan_eqs ] , in which the corrections computed in ref",
    ".  @xcite are repeated .",
    "the five first terms contain contractions of the particle four - momentum with tensors orthogonal to the fluid four - velocity , and they thus yield a vanishing contribution at the saddle points for slow particles , by the same argument as for first - order shear corrections . the last term of eq .",
    "( [ df2_teaney - yan ] ) involves on the one hand the quantity @xmath58 defined in eq .",
    "( [ xi4 ] ) , which in turn only depends on the energy and momentum of the particle in the fluid local rest frame : at the saddle point , these are simply the particle mass and zero , respectively .",
    "besides , that last term also involves the ( second - order ) dissipative stress tensor , which has to be evaluated at the same `` universal '' saddle point for particles having a given transverse velocity , and thus will contribute a term depending on momentum only through @xmath33 , @xmath2 , and @xmath27 .",
    "all in all , the correction will again lead to a distribution obeying the scaling law  ( [ slow : scaling_law ] ) .",
    "one can anticipate that nonconformal second - order corrections can be dealt with as easily . yet",
    "it may be noted that freeze out is most commonly assumed to take place at a temperature at which the fluid , according to lattice gauge field theory results , is approximately conformal , so that such corrections might actually turn out to be quite small , especially for particles that freeze out later .",

    "hereafter , we shall assume that they obey the hierarchy @xmath67 , and that higher coefficients vanish .",
    "yet our calculations can easily be repeated with any other hierarchy of the anisotropies of the maximum transverse flow velocity at freeze out .",

    "we shall for simplicity neglect this dependence , considering that it only represents a small modulation of a quantity which is already small in itself .",

    "the actual form of @xmath73 , in particular the functional dependence on @xmath1 , directly reflects that of @xmath23 .",
    "we give as an example the function @xmath73 resulting from considering only first - order shear viscous corrections as given by grad s prescription in appendix  [ app : df1_shear ] .",
    "more generally , one can compute @xmath73 starting from any ansatz for @xmath23 . this",
    "can then be compared with the shape constrained from experimental results as we explain below .    before that , let us discuss the relations  ( [ vn(pt ) ] ) , starting with the `` ideal case '' when dissipative effects vanish , i.e.  @xmath74 .",

    "another change , which is not reflected in our notations , affects the average @xmath63 and fourier coefficients @xmath64 of the maximum flow velocity at freeze out , which do depend on the amount of dissipation along the system evolution . in the following discussion",
    ", we take the values of these quantities as fixed , and we only consider the effect of including @xmath73 or not .    first , one sees at once that when @xmath78 , its inclusion leads to a decrease of every flow harmonic  ( [ vn(pt ) ] ) .",
    "now , the actual sign of @xmath73 depends on the flow profile at freeze out . in existing hydrodynamical simulations",

    "( anti)protons is identical in the transverse momentum range where they are `` fast '' ; the ratio is however not constant , but increasing .",
    "this might be due to the fact that in the considered centrality range , the hierarchy of flow harmonics does not hold , so that the nonlinear @xmath81 contribution to @xmath82 starts playing a role . in the absence of the relevant @xmath83 data",
    ", we could not investigate this idea further .",
    "] likewise , eqs .",
    "( [ v1(pt ) ] ) and ( [ v5(pt ) ] ) are very similar and predict analogous @xmath83 and @xmath84 in the regime where the linear contributions to these harmonics become negligible with respect to the @xmath85 term .",
    "let us emphasise that these similarities between different flow harmonics hold in the regime of fast particles , i.e.  far from @xmath86 , where the analyticity of the momentum distribution induces different scaling behaviours for each flow harmonic  @xcite .",
    "another finding from eqs .",
    "( [ vn(pt ) ] ) is that the nonlinear relations valid in the ideal case no longer hold .",
    "thus , @xmath87 is now smaller than @xmath88 when @xmath89 can be neglected and , more generally , this ratio is decreased by the inclusion of the dissipative correction at freeze out @xmath73 , whether or not @xmath89 is taken into account .",
    "in contrast , when neglecting @xmath90 the ratio @xmath91 increases for @xmath92 and is thus larger than the `` ideal '' value of 1 .",
    "these qualitative results are borne out by results either from a boltzmann transport model  @xcite or from hydrodynamical simulations  @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear relations can actually be exploited for more quantitative results , still in the case of negligible linear contributions .",

    "@xmath94 that is , one can isolate the dissipative contribution from decoupling to @xmath75and more generally , the term @xmath73 .",
    "here we gave two independent relations from which the dissipative term can be experimentally constrained and then compared with the functional form derived from a functional ansatz for @xmath23 .",
    "in the previous two sections , we investigated the effect of the dissipative correction @xmath23 to the phase space distribution of particles at freeze out on the particle spectrum .",
    "we first found that for slow particles , which are emitted by a fluid region moving at the same velocity , the results valid in the ideal case are qualitatively not modified by dissipative effects : spectra for different particles coincide , up to a multiplicative factor , when considered as a function of transverse velocity @xmath33 ; and this implies mass ordering of the flow harmonics .",
    "this result starts bridging the gap between the limiting cases of ideal fluid dynamics on the one side  @xcite , and boltzmann transport calculations with very few scatterings per particle on the other side  @xcite , in which the role of velocity as scaling variable was emphasised .",
    "for fast particles , we focussed on the anisotropic flow coefficients @xmath44 . here , we recovered the qualitative behaviours already identified in numerical simulations for both `` linearly '' and `` nonlinearly responding '' harmonics . in addition , we showed that by investigating appropriate combinations of several flow harmonics  involving a nonlinear one and the linear ones that contribute to it , one could ideally reconstruct from the data the momentum dependence of @xmath23 .",
    "we only gave two examples  ( [ vn_relation_1 ] ) or  ( [ vn_relation_2 ] ) of such relations , but other can be derived , in particular by generalizing our present `` single - particle '' study to multiparticle correlations .",
    "to gauge the validity of our results , especially of the relations found for fast particles , we tested them on the flow coefficients arising from the numerical integration over a three - dimensional freeze - out hypersurface @xmath15 of some flow profile .",
    "more precisely , we took for @xmath15 an infinite ( along the longitudinal axis ) azimuthally symmetric cylinder of radius @xmath95 , at a constant proper time @xmath96 . using as space - time coordinates the proper time @xmath97 , cylindrical coordinates @xmath98 and space - time rapidity @xmath99 , we assumed for the fluid velocity on @xmath15 a generalised blast wave - like profile for the radial coordinate  @xcite @xmath100 together with @xmath101 in the azimuthal and @xmath99 directions , as well as naturally @xmath102 in the timelike direction . from this expression ,",
    "one directly reads off the maximal transverse velocity [ cf .",

    "@xcite  and additionally @xmath109 , and all other @xmath110 .",
    "we performed tests with other values , without changing the findings we now report .",
    "with such a choice of flow profile , 7 out of the 10 different components of the shear viscous stress tensor @xmath111 are non - zero .",
    "nevertheless , in our saddle - point approximation we only keep @xmath112 as explained in appendix  [ app : df1_shear ] . with the relatively small chosen value of @xmath63 and with a ratio @xmath113 , the coefficient @xmath114 defined in that appendix is of order 0.6 , which ensures that some of the terms we have neglected in deriving the correction term  ( [ d(pt)_shear ] ) remain small as long as @xmath1 ( or more accurately @xmath115 ) is not too large .",
    "one can naturally depart from this assumption , at the cost of considering a more lengthy formula for the correction @xmath116 .",

    "the saddle - point behaviours  ( [ vn(pt ) ] ) represent a bad approximation to those of the numerical simulation in the @xmath1 range which seems reasonable for the comparison to experimental data .",
    "to list a few discrepancies , which already appear for the decoupling from an ideal fluid : @xmath75 in the exact blast wave model grows quadratically at low @xmath1 ( for pions , until about 11.5  gev/@xmath105 ) , while eq .",
