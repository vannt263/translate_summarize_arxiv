    "the fabrication of planar ( 2d ) microcavities has provided experimental access to the strong coupling regime between light and matter in a spatially extended system @xcite .",
    "the excitations of the coupled modes are polaritons , quasi - particles which are bosons with a very small effective mass , typically @xmath2 times that of an electron .",
    "this makes it possible to study quantum effects in a solid state system at a relatively high temperatures @xcite .",
    "the short life time of the polaritons , @xmath3 ps @xcite , means that the system has to be constantly pumped to observe bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) .",
    "it can be achieved either resonantly @xcite or non - resonantly @xcite producing condensates with long coherence times @xcite and long range spatial coherence @xcite .",
    "these have been shown to exhibit interesting nonlinear and many - body phenomena , such as vortex formation @xcite , solitons @xcite and superfluid - like flow @xcite .    in recent experiments @xcite , microcavity polaritons",
    "have been confined in wire like geometries , to study the peculiar interaction effects of bosons in a 1d system as well as a step to the realisation of polariton circuits @xcite .",
    "the extra confinement was provided in two different ways : by etching of the whole planar structure to form a wire @xcite and by excitation of surface acoustic waves ( saw ) to form a dynamic 1d lattice @xcite .",
    "it is the spatial coherence measurements in the latter setup that are the subject of the present paper . in the experiment ,",
    "the same sample area was studied with and without the saw , so it was possible to measure how the coherence length changed when the 1d confinement was introduced . without confinement , the entire 2d emission spot was coherent , that is , the coherence length was the same as the spot size @xcite . with confinement",
    "it was observed that the coherence length in the direction perpendicular to the saw wavefronts was reduced to the saw wavelength , as the condensates confined in the individual minima became decoupled .",
    "however , there was also a significant reduction in the coherence length measured parallel to the wavefronts @xcite , along the ` wires ' , which is less easily explained .    in this paper",
    "we analyse possible mechanisms for the reduction of the spatial coherence along the 1d wires .",
    "we consider the effect @xcite of polariton - polariton interactions , disorder , and finite momentum modes occupation in a harmonic trap on the first order correlation function @xmath0 .",
    "the theoretical predictions are compared with the experimentally measured @xmath0 @xcite which has a gaussian shape up to the noise floor .",
    "this shape can only be reproduced by the non - equilibrium occupation of a set of the finite momentum modes . performing a more quantitative fit , using the occupation numbers as fitting parameters , we find that the number of the excited modes in the experiment @xcite is @xmath4 .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we formulate the model of the 1d polariton system with different types of interactions . in section 3",
    "we calculate the spatial dependence of the coherence function @xmath0 when finite momentum modes are occupied in a harmonic trap .",
    "section 4 contains discussion of the anderson localisation due to disorder in a 1d system . in section 5",
    "we discuss the effect of the short range polariton - polarion interaction on @xmath0 .",
    "section 6 contains the fitting of the experimental data with the theoretical predictions from the previous sections .",
    "we consider one dimensional polaritons formed by the equal mixture of exciton and photon at the zero momentum following the experimental setup of @xcite .",
    "the motion of photons in @xmath5direction is restricted by a planar microcavity which is formed by a pair of bragg mirrors giving a small mass to the 2d photons @xmath6 .",
    "excitons are bound electron - hole pairs , they are bosons @xmath7 , which are confined to the same 2d plane by a quantum well , see the scheme in fig .",
    "the eigenmodes of a strongly interacting @xmath7 and @xmath6 are two hybrid particles , lower and upper polarions ( lp and up ) .",
    "we will consider only the lp branch as bosons @xmath8 with a parabolic dispersion and mass @xmath9 assuming that the photons and the excitons are at resonance at @xmath10 , e. g. a lp around the zero momentum consists of equal mixture of the exciton and the photon @xmath11 .",
    "bosonic nature of these polaritons allows a macroscopic occupation of the single zero momentum state that leads to a long - range phase coherence in the system .",
    "access to this regime is not straightforward as the short lived polaritons do not have time to relax at low momenta due to a slow emission of the low energy phonons forming a relaxation bottleneck and forbidding formation of the truly equilibrium condensate .",
    "this difficulty can be overcome in a nonequilibrium regime under a strong pumping when the @xmath10 state is populated directly or indirectly by employing an optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) .    in the opo scheme",
    "the system is excited by the pump at a finite momentum @xmath12 and energy @xmath13 . due to the polariton - polariton interactions the @xmath14 excitations can scatter fast to a low momentum . above a threshold density of the directly pumped polaritons",
    "the interaction becomes strong enough to reach the zero momentum state @xmath15 , signal , which also forms a significant population in the idler state @xmath16 due to the conservation of the energy @xmath17 and the momentum @xmath18 by the scattering process . above the threshold the systems locks only to these three states @xcite with a significant population of the signal state at @xmath15",
    "this approach is more advantageous than the direct pumping as in the opo regime the pump at a finite @xmath12 does not obstruct the emission from the condensate at @xmath15 .",
    "the 2d polaritons are constrained further to a set of 1d wires by an in - plane surface acoustic wave propagating along @xmath19-direction , see the scheme in fig .",
    "the @xmath19-component of the momentum belongs to the lowest energy subband leaving the only motion along @xmath20-axis unconstrained .",
    "the polaritons are detected though the photonic part which constantly escapes the system forming a spatial distribution of the electric field outside of the cavity that contains information about the polaritons inside the structure ,    @xmath21    and can be registered by a detector . here @xmath22 are the eigenmodes of the external potential in @xmath20-direction , e. g. @xmath23 if the there is no extra potential along @xmath20-axis , @xmath24 is the dispersion of the electro - magnetic modes , and @xmath25 is the length of the wire .",

    "we consider three possible mechanisms that can affect spatial coherence of free polaritons in the signal , @xmath26 around @xmath27 .",
    "first is a confining potential originating from a finite size of the excitation spot .",
    "we assume that the single particle potential is harmonic,@xmath28 where the frequency @xmath29 defines the system size as @xmath30 .",
    "second is a disorder potential that has a finite correlation length @xmath31 , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a function that vanished when @xmath34 , i. e. @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "and the third mechanism is the pair polariton - polariton interaction .",
    "it has a short range interaction potential as the polaritons have zero electric charge with the interaction strength @xmath37 .",
    "we neglect the interaction of polariton with phonons mechanism for decoherence as it is ineffective at low momenta .",
    "the polariton - phonon scattering time is @xmath38 ps @xcite which is much longer than the polariton life time @xmath39 ps . the latter is due to detuning chosen in the experiment @xcite where the polaritons at @xmath40 consist of the equal mixture of the exciton and the photon .    to analyse the spatial coherence that is observed via the photonic part of the lp we consider the first order correlation function , @xmath41\\right\\rangle } { \\left\\langle \\hat{n}\\left[e^{\\dagger}\\left(0\\right)e\\left(0\\right)\\right]\\right\\rangle } , \\label{eq : g1_def}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 $ ] is the normal ordering operator that eliminates the vacuum fluctuations of the quantised electro - magnetic field and @xmath43 is the average with respect to a state of the system .",
    "the eigenstates of the free polariton hamiltonian are plain waves .",
    "the expectation value over the zero momentum state occupied by many polaritons gives an infinite range coherence , @xmath44 . in the next three sections we analyse each of the possible mechanisms separately to see how they restrict this behaviour",
    "here we obtain the single particle eigenstates of polaritons in the harmonic trap .",
    "then we evaluate @xmath0 as the expectation value with respect to a density matrix assuming a non - equilibrium distribution of the polariton occupation numbers around the zero momentum state .",
    "the single particle hamiltonian for a polariton in a harmonic potential ,    @xmath45    is the one of the quantum harmonic oscillator .",
    "it is a well known and solved model .    following the standard approach to the diagonalisation problem we search for a solution in form of a polynomial @xcite .",
    "the eigenfunction problem for the model eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_hamonic ] ) leads to hermite s differential equation which is solved by @xmath46 where @xmath47 are the hermite polynomials , @xmath30 is the size of the system , and @xmath48 is the number of the energy level that describes a finite momentum state of the 1d polariton .",
    "the complementary eigenvalue problem can be solved via a taylor expansion . as a result",
    "the eigenenergies of the finite momentum states @xmath49 have a linear spectrum @xmath50    a many polariton state , which is created in a pumping process , is described by a density matrix .",
    "the expectation value in the correlation function eq .",
    "( [ eq : g1_def ] ) has to be evaluated as an ensemble average , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a density matrix .    in a continuous wave experiment",
    "the signal is accumulated on the time scale of seconds .",
    "the phase coherence of a polariton condensate is limited by few hundreds of pico - seconds @xcite which partitions the long accumulation interval into a large ensemble of many very short measurements .",
    "thus the total signal is averaged over many realisations with different distribution of the polariton occupation numbers and the total number of polaritons which also changes slightly in time due to the power fluctuation in the pumping laser @xcite . as the phase coherence is lost between different realisations the density matrix , which describes such an ensemble , is diagonal in the representation of the polariton occupation numbers , @xmath53 here",
    "@xmath54 is a state with @xmath55 polaritons at the momentum @xmath56 , @xmath57 polaritons at the momentum @xmath58 , etc and @xmath59 are the diagonal matrix elements that describe a non - equilibrium distribution of the boson occupation numbers .    substituting eqs .",

    "note that @xmath62 are not completely equivalent to the occupation number of the polaritons , @xmath63 , due to the normalisation of the correlation function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : g1_def ] ) .",
    "when only a few low momenta modes are excited with probabilities that are approximately equal , @xmath64 , the shape of the correlation function is almost gaussian with a reduced system size @xmath65 , @xmath66 .",
    "when many modes are excited with an arbitrary @xmath62 the shape is arbitrary as polynomials in eq .",
    "( [ eq : psi_harmonic ] ) of a high order @xmath67 can approximate a wide range of different functions .",
    "polaritons are subject to a random potential which originates from two sources .",
    "one is disorder of the quantum well that influences the exciton component of polaritons . and another is imperfections of the cavity mirrors that influences the photon component @xcite . here",
    "we consider a simplified model of the disorder characterised by a single correlation length eq .",
    "( [ eq : disorder_def ] ) and we assume that the wave length of the surface acoustic wave is smaller then the correlation length of disorder potential in the 2d heterostructure to model the strictly 1d system .",
    "if the latter is not true the polariton wire becomes a quasi-1d system which would give a longer localisation length . in this section",
    "we also neglect interplay between disorder and polariton - polariton interactions which can lead to a many body metal - insulator transition above a finite temperature @xcite and consider the low temperature case only .",
    "scaling analysis of the potential disorder problem @xcite shows that conductance of a 1d system is zero at low temperatures as all of the zero momentum states become localised when the system size increases to infinity .",
    "the lowest energy eigenstates of the single particle model ,    @xmath68    are localised with the exponential tails @xmath69 , for example see a review @xcite .",
    "therefore the first order correlation function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : g1_def ] ) evaluated with respect to these states gives a finite coherence length with the same exponential tail , @xmath70 where , in general , the localisation length @xmath71 is not equal to the correlation length of the random potential @xmath31 .",
    "here we do not perform a more detailed study of the features that are specific to the disorder in the polariton systems , e.g. @xcite , but only use the exponential tails of the correlation function as a characteristic feature of the localisation mechanism .",
    "the mermin - wagner theorem @xcite states that a long range order in a 1d system is absent due to any finite - range exchange interaction which results in a large long - range quantum fluctuations . in this section",
    "we discuss the manifestation of this general statement in the specific system of interacting 1d polaritons .",
    "the exciton component of a polariton has zero charge but a finite dipole moment . neglecting the photonic non - linearity",
    ", interaction between two polaritons has dipole - dipole nature thus it is short range .",
    "this interaction limits temporal coherence of the polariton condensate @xcite .",
    "the spatial coherence , within the model of density - density interaction with the delta - function interaction , was was analysed in details in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the coherence length is finite which is manifested by the exponential tails of the coherence function , @xmath72 in accordance with the general mermin - wagner theorem @xcite that forbids an infinite range order in the 1d systems .",
    "it was also shown in @xcite that the coherence length decreases with increase of the interaction constant , @xmath73 .",

    "the 2d spot of the pumping laser defines the system size and , therefore , limits the coherence length of the polaritons .",
    "then the microwave radiation is applied to confine the polaritons to a wire - like geometry .",
    "it was observed that the coherence length in the direction perpendicular to the wavefront was reduced from the system size to the wave length of the surface acoustic wave but , unlike it was expected , the coherence length in the unconstrained direction , parallel to the wavefront , was also reduced .",
    "we start from the qualitative analysis of the shape of the measured coherence function , @xmath75 , to identify the main mechanism that reduces the coherence length along the wires .",
    "the data on @xmath75 is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : g1_log ] on a logarithmic scale .",
    "the thick dashed lines marks an exponential function , which would correspond to the anderson localisation or polariton - polariton interaction mechanisms from sections 4 and 5 , and serve as guides for the eye . investigating both tails simultaneously , starting from the noise flow marked by the thin dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : g1_log ] , we find that the measured function has a super - linear character away from the maximum point @xcite .",

    "it is advised to use a static method of the polariton confinement to extend the spatial coherence in the 1d geometry .",
    "the finite momentum modes are most probably excited due to dynamical nature of the acoustic lattice that interacts with the zero momentum polaritons , populated indirectly in the opo setup , and scatters them to finite momenta .",
