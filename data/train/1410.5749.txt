    "alexandrov introduced the reflection method for surfaces with constant mean curvature proving that a sphere is the only closed embedded surface of constant mean curvature @xcite .",

    ", one can have a certain control of the mean curvature of the inverted surface in order to use the maximum principle of elliptic pdes theory .",
