    "the interaction hamiltonian between electrons and phonons involves a complicated matrix element or coupling function @xmath2 which describes the scattering of an electron initially in the state @xmath3 to any final state @xmath4 through the exchange of a phonon @xmath5 . here",
    "@xmath6 is a phonon branch index and the momentum transfer @xmath7 can fall outside the first brillouin zone and so phonon umklapp processes enter . in a real metal",
    "the bloch states of the band structure can be complicated and this is reflected in the electronic state labeled by @xmath3 .",
    "fortunately , many important properties of an electron - phonon system require for their understanding only a fermi surface to fermi surface average of the coupling , namely the function@xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the chemical potential , @xmath10 the electron energy , @xmath11 the electron density of states and @xmath12 the phonon spectral function .",
    "for example , in the eliashberg formulation@xcite of superconductivity based on migdal s theorem for electron - phonon vertex corrections , it is @xmath0 that enters . for the infrared conductivity",
    "another , somewhat different weighting of @xmath2 comes in and the resulting function of @xmath13 is usually called the transport spectral density denoted @xmath14.@xcite here we will not deal directly with these differences",
    ". an important goal of experiments in conventional superconductors has been to determine the electron - phonon spectral function @xmath0 .",
    "this has been successfully accomplished for a large number of conventional materials using tunneling data and the inversion technique of mcmillan and rowell.@xcite in a few cases the infrared optical conductivity@xcite was also used and excellent agreement with tunneling results was found .",
    "extensions to the consideration of the a15 compounds revealed that additional features of the band structure such as the energy dependence of the electronic density of states @xmath15 can also be important.@xcite more recently the optical data in the alkali doped c@xmath16 compounds has been inverted@xcite and found consistent with its superconductivity . when experimentally determined electron - phonon spectral functions are compared with first principle band structure calculations extended to include electron - phonon interaction good agreement is obtained .    in dealing with",
    "the high-@xmath1 oxides several complications immediately arise .",
    "first , their superconductivity is not generally believed to be due to the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "a consensus exists that the gap has @xmath17-wave rather than @xmath18-wave symmetry and comes out as a result of strong correlation effects .",
    "a natural explanation for the @xmath17-wave gap is found in the antiferromagnetic interaction certainly present in the cuprates .",
    "a possible model is the nearly antiferromagnetic fermi liquid model ( naffl ) of pines and coworkers.@xcite it needs to be pointed out , however , that there is no a priory reason why the electron - phonon interaction itself could not lead to a @xmath17-wave gap and there exists recent work on this possibility . in any case , when @xmath17-wave symmetry is involved , the spectral function acting in the gap channel eq .",
    "need not be the same as the one that determines the renormalizations in the @xmath13-channel eq .  . at @xmath1 in the normal state",
    "it is only the latter spectral density that enters .",
    "there exists considerable literature on extensions of eliashberg theory to include a @xmath17-wave gap based on model spectral densities for the electron - boson interaction that may be involved.@xcite of course , there is no guarantee that the final theory of strongly correlated systems that is needed to describe the oxides will fall within the class of boson exchange models .",
    "nevertheless , such an approach has proven valuable in providing insight into the physics of the oxides as we will see also in this paper .    in the recent literature , tunneling spectroscopy@xcite as well as",
    "angular resolved photo emission has been used to analyze data in terms of boson structure . here",
    "we wish to concentrate on optical data.@xcite optimally doped yba@xmath19cu@xmath20o@xmath21 ( ybco@xmath21 ) was first considered within a complete eliashberg formalism generalized to include @xmath17-wave pairing by carbotte _ et al._@xcite ( csb ) . a model form for the electron - boson spectral function coming possibly from exchange of spin fluctuations and denoted by @xmath22",
    "is assumed with two fitting parameters , the coupling @xmath23 and the spin fluctuation energy @xmath24 in the model of millis _ et al._@xcite ( mmp ) which are varied to get the best fit to the normal state infrared data at or close to @xmath25 .",
    "for the superconducting state the same form of @xmath22 is assumed to also determine the gap channel but its magnitude is different and is fit to get the measured value of @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , it is found that the data in the superconducting state indicates the formation of an optical resonance in @xmath22 not present at @xmath1 which increases in amplitude as @xmath26 is reduced and is positioned at @xmath27mev .",
    "similar optical resonances were later found in the superconducting state of other cuprates although not in all.@xcite in some the resonance seems to persist even in the normal state.@xcite while the work described above involves a least squares fit of an assumed form for @xmath22 to the optical scattering rate data other inversion techniques@xcite have been considered but so far these are based on approximate analytic formulas for the relationship between the optical scattering rate and the electron - boson spectral density rather than the full eliashberg formulation of carbotte and coworkers .",
    "such approximate formulas were given by allen@xcite for an electron - phonon system and are based on ordinary second order perturbation theory at zero temperature . allen considered the normal as well as the superconducting state with @xmath18-wave symmetry .",
    "a generalization to finite temperature was provided by shulga _",
    "et al._@xcite who only considered the normal state but started directly from an eliashberg formalism and the kubo formula for the conductivity . a generalization to include as well",
    "a pseudogap was recently provided by sharapov and carbotte.@xcite finally , carbotte and schachinger@xcite generalized the original work of allen to a superconductor with @xmath17-wave gap symmetry .",
    "the advantage of these simplified but approximate equations is that they relate directly through an integral the optical scattering rate to the desired spectral function @xmath22 and various numerical techniques such as singular value decomposition@xcite can be used to numerically invert the equation .",
    "of course , the alternate method of assuming some characteristic functional form for @xmath22 and least squares fit a few parameters to the data can also be employed based on the simplified equations described above instead of employing the full eliashberg equations .",

    "the second subsection discusses approximate formulas for the normal and superconducting state which allow one to calculate the optical scattering rate @xmath29 from a given spectral density @xmath0 using a convolution integral .",
    "section  [ sec:3 ] discusses numerically the caveats and merits of the various methods of inversion by studying normal metals as well as high-@xmath1 cuprates .",
    "computer generated and experimental @xmath29 data for the normal and superconducting state are used as input for the inversion .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] .",
    "two appendices have been added .",
    "appendix  [ app : a ] gives an overview of the maximum entropy method in terms of bayesian probability theory .",
    "appendix  [ app : b ] presents all important equations which allow to calculate the optical scattering rate within the framework of full eliashberg theory .",
    "in order to understand the mechanism of superconductivity it is important to have detailed knowledge of the spectral function @xmath0 and as tunneling , the established source of information on @xmath0,@xcite was initially not a successful tool in the high-@xmath1 superconductors , the infrared optical conductivity , @xmath30 , became increasingly important , particularly in the form of the optical scattering rate @xmath31\\ ] ] of extended drude theory . here",
    ", @xmath32 is the plasma frequency .",
    "there are , in principle , three methods to extract the information on @xmath0 from the optical scattering rate ( inversion ) .",
    "an essential requirement for a solution obtained with any of these methods is that the result should match the data points as well as possible . in order to assess the quality of the fit we need to know how the experimental data points @xmath33 scatter around the ` true ' values @xmath34 ,",
    "that is , we need to know in terms of bayesian probability theory the likelihood @xmath35 .",
    "it describes the distribution of @xmath36 data points @xmath37 given the ` exact ' values @xmath38 , which are usually expressed in terms of the parameters of the physical model .",
    "the symbol @xmath39 designates all additionally available background information comprising the experimental setup as well as the physical model employed .",
    "the likelihood is determined by the experimental setup and we have to keep in mind that the experimental signal contains at least three contributions@xcite @xmath40 with @xmath41 usually a slowly varying background signal which is typical of the experimental setup and @xmath42 , the noise in the data .",
    "unfortunately , we do not have any knowledge concerning the functional form of the likelihood for the experimental data sets considered in this study .",
    "therefore , we make the _ assumption _ of an uncorrelated normal distribution with standard deviation @xmath43 : @xmath44 here @xmath45 is the misfit @xmath46 which is expressed in terms of the residuals @xmath47 they measure the deviation of the data points @xmath48 from the ` true ' values @xmath49 ( or the best estimates thereof ) in units of the error bar @xmath43 .    for lack of further information , we argue that the likelihood is a reasonable choice and we note that it is , in fact , the most uninformative probability distribution given only the mean value and the variance and _ no further information_.@xcite we want to stress that curve fitting with minimization of the misfit @xmath45 is also implicitly based on the assumption of a gaussian likelihood .",
    "the problem of obtaining @xmath0 from @xmath50 is extremely ill conditioned .",
    "this implies that a direct solution will be totally dominated by noise and , therefore , be completely meaningless .",
    "for this reason , all methods discussed here involve a _ nuisance _ or regularization parameter that can be tuned in order to suppress noise contributions .",
    "apart from ad - hoc settings , a sensible choice is to adjust the regularization parameter such that @xmath51 is obtained .",
    "( see appendix  [ app : a ] . )",
    "the first method of inversion is based on the relationship@xcite @xmath52\\ ] ] which is approximately equal to @xmath0 in the normal state at zero temperature .",
    "application of this formula to experimental data will result in numerical difficulties because we have to keep in mind that the experimental signal @xmath50 consists , according to eq .",
    ", of at least three contributions .",
    "two of these , namely @xmath41 and @xmath42 can obscure completely the looked for spectral function @xmath0 when the second derivative of @xmath50 is calculated .    on first sight , eq .",
    "would require that @xmath50 must be ambiguously smoothed ` by hand'@xcite which is certainly not true .",
    "first of all , it is much better to ` smooth ' the function @xmath53 which is monotonically increasing , much less structured , and equal to zero at @xmath54 .",
    "the application of standard data processing techniques like fast - fourier - transform ( fft ) smoothing or fft low pass filters on this function allows one to remove quite reliably the noise contribution @xmath42 .",
    "for instance , the upper frequency threshold applied to the fft low pass filter will play the role of a nuisance ( or renormalization ) parameter in this particular case . if there is further knowledge about the background function @xmath41 application of eq .   is much safer than it looks on first sight .",
    "we will discuss caveats and merits of this _ second derivative method _",
    "later on using computer generated results which ensure @xmath55 and which allow a controlled noise contribution @xmath42 .",
    "the second method of inversion is based on the deconvolution of the approximate relation @xmath56 where @xmath26 denotes the temperature .",
    "the kernel @xmath57 is determined from theory .",
    "the caveat of this method is that solutions of eq .   for @xmath0",
    "are not unique because , generally , the deconvolution of eq .",
    "constitutes an ill - posed problem .",
    "there are two approaches to solve this deconvolution problem and both are based on a discretization of eq .   of the form",
    "@xmath58 with @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the first approach is straight forward and is called _ singular value decomposition_@xcite ( svd ) which is based on the vector form of eq .  ,",
    "namely @xmath61 with the vector @xmath62 , the matrix @xmath63 , and the vector @xmath64 .",
    "using svd , the matrix of dimension @xmath65 is transformed into the matrix product @xmath66 , with and being unitary matrices of dimension @xmath65 and @xmath67 respectively .",
    "the matrix @xmath68 with @xmath69 the singular values ( svs ) .",
    "finally , @xmath70 denotes the transposed matrix .",
    "if the vector * t * and the matrix are known the vector * a * and , thus , @xmath0 can be determined by ` inverting ' eq .",
    ": @xmath71 with @xmath72 .",
    "however , noise contained in the data * t * will be dramatically magnified by smallest svs , rendering the result meaningless .",
    "for this reason , all contributions by svs below a certain threshold have to be discarded by replacing the corresponding diagonal elements @xmath73 in the matrix @xmath74 by zeros .",
    "this threshold plays the role of the nuisance parameter in the svd method .",
    "et al._@xcite studied this approach extensively and discussed in particular the number of svs necessary to get a ` smooth ' spectral function @xmath0 together with a reasonable reconstruction of the input data . in principle the problem of ` smoothing by hand ' is moved from the input to the output of the process .",
    "the caveat of this approach is the fact that it does nt ensure that the resulting spectral function @xmath0 be positive definite .",
    "most of the time , @xmath0 will contain negative parts which can not be removed even by applying further regularization schemes.@xcite such negative parts are unphysical .",
    "the second approach to the deconvolution problem is the so - called _ maximum entropy method _ ( maxent ) .",
    "originally , e.t .",
    "jaynes@xcite suggested the maximum entropy principle for the assignment of probability distributions : if only some testable information such as the mean value is given , one should select that probability distribution @xmath75 which maximizes the shannon entropy@xcite @xmath76 subject to all known constraints . in the case where only the mean and the variance are known",
    ", the normal distribution is the ` most uninformative ' probability distribution ( pdf ) .",
    "although the ` true ' pdf may be completely different , a normal distribution can be a sensible choice for lack of further background information .",
    "the maxent principle has been generalized to the inference of strictly positive functions such as the spectral function @xmath0 within bayesian probability theory .",
    "this fully probabilistic description allows for an explicit treatment of the ambiguity inherent in badly conditioned problems and is discussed in some detail in appendix  [ app : a ] . in our particular case",
    "the generalized shannon - jaynes entropy is applicable with the default model vector * m * chosen to be constant . most of the time this constant is chosen in such a way that the spectral function @xmath0 develops a certain high energy behavior .",
    "the third method of inversion uses model spectral functions which depend on a few parameters which are then determined using a _",
    "least squares fit _ to experiment based either on approximate formulas of the form or full eliashberg theory .",
    "very often preliminary results derived with the help of the second derivative method from experiment ( or using one of the other above mentioned methods ) can be utilized to minimize the number of parameters to be fitted .",
    "results from other experiments , for instance inelastic neutron scattering etc . , can easily be incorporated . nevertheless , in general this method",
    "will also result in non - unique solutions for @xmath0 .      for the normal state at zero temperature allen@xcite",

    "another important issue discussed in detail is the accuracy , advantages , and limitations of various numerical methods which are needed to invert data even within the limitations of approximate formulas for the optical scattering rate .",

    "the second derivative technique applied to computer generated optical scattering rates based on eliashberg theory reproduces well the spectral function @xmath0 of pb .",
    "there is a slight overestimate of the longitudinal and transverse phonon peaks as well as a small shift to higher energy .",
    "the region between the peaks is slightly underestimated and unphysical tails occur beyond the debye energy but these are to be ignored . if the same data is inverted using either svd or maxent , the agreement between the spectral function of pb and and the deconvoluted spectral functions remains good even though both inversion methods are based on an approximate lowest order perturbation theory expression for the relation between spectral function and scattering rate while the @xmath29 data is based on eliashberg relations .",
    "it is noted , however , that maxent does somewhat better than svd which introduces additional oscillations into the resulting spectral density not present in the @xmath0 of pb . as the temperature is increased in the normal state",

    "these oscillations are also seen in the case of the maxent inversion but they are less prominent and quite small . of the two inversion methods considered above maxent",
    "is to be preferred because it has the advantage that few assumptions , namely a default model and error bars attached to the data , will result in a deconvoluted spectrum which allows excellent data reconstruction .",
    "this spectrum can also be expected to contain , at least qualitatively , all the main features of the ` real ' spectrum .    as a result of all this ,",
    "inversion of normal state @xmath50 data , even at high temperatures , can lead to useful quantitative results if the boson exchange spectral function is expected to be rather smooth with little structure .",
    "the application of methods based on the approximate kernel is to be favored because there are only little differences between this kernel and full eliashberg theory",
    ".    for the low temperature superconducting state use of the eliashberg equations for the calculation of the optical scattering rate @xmath29 along with numerical inversion based on approximate lowest order perturbation theory simplified formulas leads to larger quantitative differences between the @xmath0 spectrum of lead and deconvoluted spectrum than were noted for the normal state of lead .",
    "nevertheless , both svd and maxent methods yield very useful , qualitative and even semi quantitative information on the shape and size of @xmath0 with the maxent method , again , to be preferred .",
    "inversion of experimental data on the optical scattering rate ( as opposed to computer generated data ) already exists in the literature in a few cases and these are based on full eliashberg solutions and the kubo formula .",
    "these inversions , however , proceed through a least squares fit of the scattering rates assuming a specific mathematical form for @xmath22 characterized by a few parameters , namely an mmp form with a low frequency cutoff plus a resonance peak at a specified frequency .",
    "such fits have had considerable success when applied to normal and superconducting state in optimally doped cuprates .",
    "attempts have been made since additional complications arise due to the emergence of the pseudogap .",
    "as yet no consensus exists as to the origin of this pseudogap and , thus , modeling its effect remains controversial .",
    "even though , as noted above , the svd and maxent methods are limited due to inaccuracies in the approximate second order perturbation form used to relate optical scattering rate to spectral density ( instead of the complete eliashberg analysis ) , we have used maxent inversions to confirm the previously obtained least squares fits .",
    "all qualitative features of the resulting @xmath22 function , namely , coupling to an optical resonance at low energy and to a background extending even beyond @xmath179mev are confirmed and new features have been unveiled .",

    "other constraints such as known properties of the superconducting state could be added as well in the fit .",
