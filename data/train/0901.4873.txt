    "the littlest higgs model with t - parity is one of the attractive candidates for physics beyond the standard model because it solves both the little hierarchy and dark matter problems simultaneously .",
    "one of the important predictions of the model is the existence of new heavy gauge bosons , where they acquire mass terms through the breaking of the global symmetry necessarily imposed on the model .",
    "the precise measurements of their masses allow us to determine the most important parameter of the model , namely the vacuum expectation value of the breaking .    at the large hadron collider ( lhc )",
    ", it is difficult to determine the properties of heavy gauge bosons , because they have no color charge @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the ilc will provide an ideal environment to measure the properties of heavy gauge bosons .",
    "heavy gauge bosons are expected to be produced in a clean environment at the ilc , which enables us to determine their properties precisely .",
    "we study the sensitivity of the measurements to the masses of heavy gauge bosons and the vacuum expectation value at the ilc based on a realistic monte carlo simulation .",
    "in order to perform a numerical simulation , we need to choose a representative point in the parameter space of the littlest higgs model with t - parity .",
    "firstly , the model parameters should satisfy the experimental results of the precise measurements on the electroweak parameters @xcite .",
    "in addition , the cosmological observation of dark matter relics also gives important information .",
    "for that reason , we consider not only the electroweak precision measurements but also the wmap observation @xcite to choose a point in the parameter space . at selected representative point ,",
    "the vacuum expectation value(@xmath7 ) is 580 gev , and the masses of the heavy gauge boson are 81.9 gev and 369 gev for @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "r0.3        because sum of @xmath5 and @xmath6 is less than 500 gev , @xmath5 and @xmath6 can be generated through the process @xmath8 at @xmath0 gev .",
    "feynman diagram for the signal process is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : signal diagrams ] .",
    "@xmath2  decays into @xmath9 with almost 100% branching fractions .",
    "we have used madgraph @xcite to generate signal events of the little higgs model , while standard model events have been generated by physsim @xcite .",
    "initial - state radiation and beamstrahlung have not been included in the event generations .",
    "we have ignored the finite crossing angle between the electron and positron beams . in both event generations",
    ", helicity amplitudes were calculated using the helas library @xcite , which allows us to deal with the effect of gauge boson polarizations properly .",
    "phase space integration and the generation of parton 4-momenta have been performed by bases / spring @xcite .",
    "parton showering and hadronization have been carried out by using pythia6.4 @xcite , where final - state tau leptons are decayed by tauola @xcite in order to handle their polarizations correctly .",
    "the generated monte carlo events have been passed to a detector simulator called jsfquicksimulator , which implements the gld geometry and other detector - performance related parameters @xcite .",
    "the simulation has been performed at @xmath10 500 gev with an integrated luminosity of 500 fb@xmath11 . the heavy gauge bosons , @xmath1  and @xmath2  , are produced with the cross section of 1.9 fb . since @xmath2  decays into @xmath1  and the higgs boson , the signature is a single higgs boson in the final state , mainly 2 jets from @xmath12 ( with a 55% branching ratio ) .",
    "we , therefore , define @xmath13  as our signal event . for background events ,",
    "contribution from light quarks was not taken into account because such events can be rejected to negligible level after requiring the existence of two @xmath14-jets , assuming a @xmath14-tagging efficiency of 80% for @xmath14-jets with 15% probability to misidentify a @xmath15-jet as a @xmath14-jet .",
    "this @xmath14-tagging performance was estimated by the full simulation assuming a typical ilc detector .",
    "signal and background processes considered in this analysis are summarized in table [ tb : zhevlst ] .",
    "the clusters in the calorimeters are combined to form a jet if the two clusters satisfy @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 is defined as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the angle between momenta of two clusters , @xmath20 are their energies , and @xmath21 is the total visible energy .",
    "all events are forced to have two jets by adjusting @xmath22 .",
    "we have selected events with the reconstructed higgs mass in a window of 100 - 140 gev . in order to suppress the @xmath23  background ,",
    "the transverse momentum of the reconstructed higgs bosons ( @xmath24 ) is required to be above 80 gev .",
    "this is because the higgs bosons coming from the @xmath25 fusion process , which dominates the @xmath23  background , have @xmath24  mostly below w mass .",
    "finally , multiplying the efficiency of double @xmath14-tagging ( @xmath26 ) , we are left with 272 signal and 5,419 background events as shown in table [ tb : zhevlst ] , which corresponds to a signal significance of 3.7 ( @xmath27 ) standard deviations .",
    "the indication of the new physics signal can hence be obtained at @xmath0 gev .",
    "the @xmath1  and @xmath2  boson masses can be estimated from the edges of the distribution of the reconstructed higgs boson energies .",
    "this is because the maximum and minimum higgs boson energies ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) are written in terms of these masses , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the @xmath32 factor of the @xmath2  boson in the laboratory frame , while @xmath33 is the energy ( momentum ) of the higgs boson in the rest frame of the @xmath2  boson .",
    "note that @xmath34 is given as @xmath35 .",
    "deviations from the best fit point in the @xmath1  and @xmath2  mass plane .",
    "the shaded area in shows the unphysical region of @xmath36 gev . ]",
    "figure [ fig : hene](a ) shows the energy distribution of the reconstructed higgs bosons with remaining backgrounds .",
    "we obtained the signal distribution after subtracting backgrounds as shown in fig.[fig : hene](b ) .",
    "the endpoints , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , have been derived by fitting the distribution with a line shape function which was determined by a high statistics signal sample .",
    "the fit resulted in @xmath5 and @xmath6 being @xmath37 gev and @xmath38 gev , respectively , which should be compared to their true values : 81.85 gev and 368.2 gev .",
    "figure [ fig : hene](c ) shows the probability contour for the masses of @xmath1  and @xmath2  .",
    "since the masses of the heavy gauge bosons depend on the vacuum expectation value , @xmath7 can be determined by measurement of the gauge boson masses .",
    "we obtained @xmath39 gev .",
    "the input value of @xmath7 is 580 gev in our simulation study .",
    "at the ilc with @xmath0 gev , it is possible to produce @xmath1   and @xmath2  bosons with a signal significance of 3.7-sigma level . by using the energy distribution of the higgs bosons from",
    "the @xmath2  decays , the masses of these bosons can be determined with accuracies of 16.2% for @xmath5 and 4.3% for @xmath6 . from the results , it turns out that the vacuum expectation value can be determined with accuracy of 4.3% .",
    "the details on this analysis can be found in @xcite .",
    "we would like to thank all the members of the ilc physics subgroup @xcite for useful discussions .",
