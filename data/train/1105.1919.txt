    "<S> the transmission of the probe through the single atom+mirror system is mathematically equivalent to a cavity , but the origin of the peaked transmission profile can be interpreted as a line - narrowing effect due to the qed - induced changes of the spontaneous emission rate and level shift . in our experiment , we observed a change of the coupling between the atom and the probe mode , due to the modification of the mode density induced by the mirror . </S>",
    "<S> deviations from the sinusoidal shape due to line narrowing would be visible for a lens covering a solid angle of more than 10% . we note that , with this interpretation , the aberration - free dependence of the extinction contrast is analogous to an almost complete cancelation and enhancement by a factor of two of the atomic coupling constant in the probe mode .    </S>",
    "<S> we foresee a direct application of our system . in discrete variable quantum communications , and specifically for quantum repeater architectures , single photons must be stored and released from stationary qubits @xcite to prevent the unavoidable losses in optical fibers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the required efficient coupling between a single photon and a single atom can be obtained through the use of a high finesse cavity @xcite , or parabolic mirrors for mode - matching the incoming field with the whole atomic dipole field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our single atom - mirror set - up is an attractive alternative solution for full absorption of a single photon . </S>",
    "<S> in such a scenario , the retro - reflection of the back - scattered field by the mirror mediates the required interference effect so that the excitation probability of the atom can reach more than 50% @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , unlike standard lossless mirrors , the ion will fully reflect the light back into the probe mode only for @xmath36 so in the realistic na case , the scattered field is emitted into almost @xmath37 steradian . since impedance matching is here not immediately fulfilled , in order to attain a steady state transmission of the optical field through such a system , one can optically pump a fraction of atomic population to another state to match the input mirror reflectivity . implementing a dynamic coherent transfer of population @xcite to another metastable ground state will furthermore allow efficient and long lived quantum storage of a single photon pulse in the atom . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , one could ramp the mirror position from the anti - node to the node of the standing wave so as to match the incoming photon s temporal profile to the ion - mirror system and store the photon in the long lived atomic excited state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although the present results are obtained in the elastic scattering regime with two levels , our experimental results may be seen as the first tests of such a new single atom - photon interface .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we successfully observed the operation of a single atom as an optical mirror of a fabry - prot - like cavity . </S>",
    "<S> our investigations are performed in a novel regime where a significant fraction of the power of a probe field can be affected by the atom in free space . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to realize an experiment in which both the properties of an atom as a reflector and the modification of the atomic coupling constant can play a role . </S>",
    "<S> although a simple cavity interpretation lends itself naturally to a description of our experiment , a more general qed formulation should be preferred for an unambiguous discrimination of the involved mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , for our experimental parameters ( weak excitation , small atom - mirror distances ) , we found that both interpretations are equivalent . </S>",
    "<S> besides the appealing quantum memory application that we presented above , our set - up has a number of other realistic prospects . </S>",
    "<S> it will , for instance , be a useful tool for operating the ion as an optical switch , similar to the single atom transistors using eit implemented in @xcite or using a population inversion @xcite .    </S>",
