    "the helium atom has proven to be a productive testing ground for fundamental physics .",
    "frequency metrology has been employed as a sensitive test of qed calculations , and also to probe the influence on level energies of the finite size of the nucleus .",
    "such measurements are currently receiving a lot of attention since a measurement of the proton radius in muonic hydrogen found a @xmath6 discrepancy with the 2010 codata value  @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy has been named the `` proton radius puzzle '' , and research is extended to the helium nucleus , with current experiments focussing on the muonic helium ion  @xcite .",
    "in neutral helium , theory and experiment have developed to a level where it is possible to determine the difference in nuclear charge radius between @xmath7 and @xmath8 with high accuracy  @xcite .",
    "one transition very sensitive to the nuclear charge radius is the @xmath0 transition , which has recently been measured in an ultracold gas trapped in an optical dipole trap ( odt )  @xcite .",
    "this was done both in a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of @xmath9 in the metastable @xmath10 state ( @xmath11 ) and in a degenerate fermi gas of @xmath12 .",
    "the 2.3 khz experimental accuracy of the isotope shift was limited by the ac - stark shift induced by the odt .",
    "this problem is also encountered in optical lattice clocks where it is solved by employing so - called magic wavelength traps  @xcite . in a magic wavelength trap ,",
    "the wavelength of the trapping laser is chosen such that the upper and lower state polarizability are exactly the same , cancelling out the differential ac - stark shift .",
    "for the @xmath10 and @xmath13 levels of helium , we have previously calculated the ac polarizability and compiled a list of magic wavelengths for both isotopes  @xcite .",
    "all useful magic wavelengths are in the ultraviolet spectral region with the most promising candidate located at 319.815  nm for @xmath8 and 319.830  nm for @xmath7 .",
    "trapping atoms at this wavelength is not straightforward .",
    "first of all , to achieve a trap depth comparable to  @xcite , where an infrared odt at 1557  nm was used , an optical power of approximately 1  w is required .",
    "such powers are not readily available at ultraviolet wavelengths .",
    "secondly , the lifetime of atoms trapped at this magic wavelength is intrinsically limited by two mechanisms : off - resonant excitation to the nearby @xmath14 transition at 318.9  nm , and two - photon ionization .",
    "the total loss rate from these processes should not exceed about 1 @xmath15 , to allow sufficient probe time for spectroscopy .",
    "considerable progress has been made in the production of laser light at the nearby wavelength of 313  nm , for the purpose of laser cooling @xmath3 ions  @xcite .",
    "high power ( 750  mw ) was generated by sum frequency mixing and subsequent frequency doubling of two fiber lasers , retaining most of their high spatial and spectral mode quality  @xcite .",
    "more recently , production of up to 2  w was demonstrated with such a scheme  @xcite .    in section  [ sec : lasersys ] , we demonstrate a laser system producing over 2  w at 319.8  nm based on a modification of this scheme . our system is built out of commercially available components which makes it simple , compact , and reliable . in section  [ sec :",
    "trapping ] we show that our source can be used to trap helium atoms with an acceptable lifetime of a few seconds , such that spectroscopy on the @xmath0 transition can be performed .",
    "the system can be divided in a sum frequency generation ( sfg ) part , which generates 639.6  nm light from two infrared lasers , and a second harmonic generation ( shg ) part which frequency doubles the sfg light to 319.8  nm . in the following , we will first give a full overview of the optical system before discussing the results and performance of the sfg and shg parts separately .",
    "figure  [ fig : setup ] shows a schematic overview of the optical setup .",
    "the setup is relatively compact with all of the components , except for the lasers and the control electronics , mounted on a single 1000@xmath16500 @xmath17 optical breadboard .",
    "the system starts with two fiber lasers ( nkt photonics koheras adjustik e15 and y10 ) with center wavelengths of 1557.28  nm and 1085.45  nm .",
    "the thermal tuning ranges are 1000  pm and 700  pm respectively , covering a spectral range much larger than the uncertainty in the calculated magic wavelength .",
    "the lasers seed two 10  w fiber amplifiers ( nufern nua-1084-pb-0010-c2 and nua-1550-pb-0010-c2 ) , with isolated polarization maintaining free - space output couplers .",
    "the beams are separately focussed to achieve optimal sum frequency generation .",
    "the output beams are to an excellent degree of approximation gaussian , and can be described completely by two parameters : their ( minimum ) waist size ( @xmath18 ) , which is directly related to their rayleigh range ( @xmath19 ) , and the position of their focus . in order to achieve optimal conversion these parameters must be matched both to each other and to the crystal .",
    "achieving this condition is not entirely straightforward because of the coupled nature of the problem .",
    "we first collimate the 1557.3  nm beam with an @xmath20 lens , and then focus by two lenses with focal distances of -100  mm and 200  mm .",
    "the beam waist can now be changed by moving either of the focussing lenses , but doing so will also move the focal point .",
    "the 1085.5  nm beam is first passed through a telescope consisting of two lenses with focal distances of 200  mm and 50  mm and is then focussed by an @xmath20 lens .",
    "the focal point can be changed without affecting the waist size by moving the focussing lens . in this way ,",
    "the foci of the beams are matched by first setting the waist of the 1085.5  nm beam to the desired focussing , secondly matching the 1557.3  nm beam waist to it , and finally overlapping the focal point of the 1085.5  nm beam with that of the 1557.3  nm beam .    with fixed beam parameters ,",
    "the infrared beams are overlapped on a dichroic mirror and passed through a 40  mm mgo doped periodically poled lithium niobate ( ppln ) crystal ( covesion ) with a poling period of @xmath21 .",
    "the crystal is mounted in an oven and temperature stabilized at @xmath22c .",
    "the output beam from the crystal contains both the sum frequency and residual infrared light .",
    "this residual light is filtered from the beam by two dichroic mirrors and the sfg beam is collimated by a @xmath23 lens to a waist of @xmath24 .",
    "the light is then coupled ( free - space ) into a commercial frequency doubling system ( toptica shg  pro ) where it is mode - matched to the cavity and passed through an electro - optical modulator ( eom ) .",
    "the eom modulates 2  mhz sidebands on the laser carrier frequency to allow pound - drever - hall locking of the cavity .",
    "the doubling cavity is similar to @xcite , the main differences being the locking scheme ( pound - drever - hall instead of hnsch - couillaud ) and the crystal ( ar - coated rather than brewster cut ) .",
    "the uv output is collimated and passed through an anamorphic prism pair to reduce beam ellipticity .",
    "the purpose of the sfg stage is to convert the available infrared laser light into useful sfg light with high efficiency . to achieve this",
    "it is necessary to focus the input beams tightly so that a high peak intensity is reached , but not so tightly that the beams diverge too quickly before they reach the end of the crystal .",
    "as described by boyd and kleinman  @xcite , this process can be optimized with respect to the dimensionless focussing parameter @xmath25 , which is the ratio of the crystal length @xmath26 to the confocal parameter of the beam ( twice the rayleigh length @xmath27 ) .",
    "although optimal at @xmath28 , the efficiency varies quite slowly so that at confocal focussing ( @xmath29 ) it is still approximately 80% of its maximum value .",
    "the system produces more power than required and the confocal condition is chosen because of practical considerations such as the available path length and the size of the entrance surface of the crystal .",
    "the infrared beams were set to the confocal condition as described in section  [ sec : overview ] .",
    "the waist sizes are measured to be @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) for the 1085.5  nm beam and @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) for the 1557.3  nm beam , with their waist positions located within 1  mm of each other . by correcting for the refractive index of the crystals , which can be calculated based on known sellmeier coefficients  @xcite",

    "( b ) contourplot of the sum frequency power as a function of both input powers , based on a linear interpolation of the same dataset as ( a ) .",

    "( b ) contourplot of the sum frequency power as a function of both input powers , based on a linear interpolation of the same dataset as ( a ) .",
    "black diamonds indicate measured datapoints , the dashed lines indicate contours of constant ipp.,title=\"fig:\",height=151 ]    figure  [ fig : sfgconv]a shows the converted power as a function of the product of the input powers ( input power product , ipp ) .",
    "when different combinations of input powers with equal ipp are used they produce almost the same sfg output power .",
    "this can be seen more clearly in a contour plot of the output power as a function of input powers ( figure  [ fig : sfgconv]b , based on a linear interpolation of the same dataset ) where contours of constant ipp follow constant output power . from this",
    "we conclude that the total converted power is a function of ipp only , and does not depend on the exact composition of infrared powers .    in order to achieve the power conversion plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig : sfgconv]a and [ fig : sfgconv]b , it is necessary to optimize for crystal temperature at each input power product .",
    "the reason for this is shown in figure  [ fig : sfgtemp ] , which shows the conversion efficiency as a function of crystal temperature at different input powers .",
    "as the input power becomes higher , the optimal temperature shifts to lower temperature and the crystal temperature needs to be adjusted to achieve maximum conversion .",
    "a possible explanation for this behaviour is that light is absorbed in the center of the crystal and heats it locally .",
    "this causes a slightly elevated temperature , and consequently imperfect phase matching at the center of the crystal ( where conversion occurs ) compared to the crystal edge ( with respect to which the temperature is controlled ) .",
    "this effect is compensated when the crystal temperature is set to a slightly lower temperature .",
    "( blue circles ) , @xmath36 ( red squares ) , and @xmath37 ( black diamonds ) . at higher input powers",
    "the temperature graph becomes slanted towards lower temperature , indicating thermal effects.,height=151 ]    at low input powers the shg output power scales linearly with a slope of @xmath38 , comparable to other experiments using a similar crystal  @xcite . at higher output powers a deviation from the linear behaviour",
    "this may be a left - over thermal effect , or it may be that , because of the high conversion efficiency , pump depletion needs to be taken into account . at an ipp of @xmath39 , consisting of 8  w at 1557.3  nm and 10  w at 1085.5  nm ,",
    "a maximum output power of almost 6  w of sfg light is produced , which corresponds to a conversion efficiency of 33% .      with the generated sfg light ,",
    "the toptica shg pro system is pumped .",
    "using a commercial frequency doubling system has the advantages of reliability and stability but a downside is that some system parameters are not disclosed .",
    "we will therefore describe the system as a whole with reported in- and output powers measured before and after the full system .",
    "50%.,title=\"fig:\",height=151 ] 50%.,title=\"fig:\",height=151 ]    figure  [ fig : shgconv ] shows the system output power and conversion efficiency of the shg section . at an input power of @xmath402 w",
    "the conversion efficiency saturates at about 50% and at an input power of 4  w a maximum output power of more than 2  w of uv light was achieved . at this point",
    "the cavity coupling efficiency is just over 80% .",
    "this behaviour is qualitatively similar to what is observed in other shg systems  @xcite .",
    "although more sfg input power is available , we choose to remain below 4  w input power as the system is already operating close to the ( uv induced ) damage threshold of the crystal at these powers  @xcite .",
    "peak - to - peak uv intensity fluctuations of 4% were measured over a 4  hour period .",
    "this is within the specifications for intensity noise of the fiber amplifiers .",
    "the beam profile of the cavity output is still gaussian , but shows ellipticity due to crystal walk - off . directly from the cavity we observe a beam waist of @xmath41 in the vertical and @xmath42 in the horizontal direction .",
    "this beam is passed through a collimating lens and an anamorphic prism pair to produce a more circular beam .",
    "we measure the final beam waist of @xmath43 . despite the modest ellipticity",
    "these beam parameters still allow tight focussing , an essential requirement for optical dipole trapping .",
    "now that we are able to produce sufficient power at 319.8  nm , we implement the laser system into our existing setup to demonstrate trapping and to characterize the trap lifetime .",
    "we prepare the beam for trapping by enlarging it with a 1:2 telescope and focus it inside the vacuum chamber with an @xmath44 lens to a waist of @xmath45 .",
    "the focus positions along the horizontal and vertical axes are found to lie 12(2 )  mm apart which is small compared to the rayleigh lengths ( 40.0(6 )  mm and 30.0(4 )  mm ) .",
    "we measure 62% total transmission of the two windows of the vacuum chamber . while high , these losses are expected from uncoated sapphire vacuum windows  @xcite .",
    "a transmission per window of @xmath46 is assumed to estimate the power inside the vacuum chamber .",
    "therefore , at a power ( @xmath47 ) of 1  w and neglecting astigmatism , the beam has peak intensity @xmath48 based on the polarizability ( calculated in  @xcite ) this translates to a trap depth of @xmath49 for a single beam .",
    "the trap depth of our odt is therefore far below the recoil temperature @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the photon wavenumber and @xmath52 is the atomic mass of helium .",
    "we can therefore safely assume that each photon scattering event leads to the loss of the scattered atom .",
    "additionally , the excess energy of the scattered atom can heat the other atoms or even kick more atoms out of the trap .    when two- and three - body losses can be neglected , the total loss rate is a combination of three distinct rates : a background loss rate @xmath53 due to the background pressure inside the chamber , a loss rate @xmath54 due to photon scattering , and a loss rate @xmath55 due to two - photon ionization .",
    "these mechanisms scale in different ways with odt power .",
    "the total loss rate is @xmath56    the rayleigh length of the focussed uv beam is comparable to the @xmath404 cm spacing between the vacuum windows .",
    "therefore , in a single beam odt trapped atoms are able to collide with the windows and leave the trap .",
    "to avoid this some means of axial confinement is necessary .",
    "we use two different methods to provide this confinement .",
    "the first is to add a magnetic field gradient along the beam direction to create a hybrid trap  @xcite . with this method",
    "the loss rate and trap depth are straightforward to interpret",
    ". however , peak densities are not high enough to produce a bec .",
    "the other method is to create a two - colour crossed - beam odt using the uv beam and additionally a focussed 1557 nm beam which was already in place  @xcite .",
    "this trap gives a high enough peak density for a bec to form .",
    "we prepare an ultracold sample in a way previously described  @xcite .",
    "a beam of @xmath57 atoms is generated from a liquid nitrogen cooled dc - discharge , collimated , slowed in a zeeman slower , and captured in a magneto - optical trap .",
    "here the atoms are cooled to approximately 0.5  mk .",
    "subsequently they are spin - polarized , loaded into a ioffe - pritchard type magnetic trap and doppler cooled to approximately @xmath58 . finally , the atoms are cooled to @xmath1 by forced rf evaporative cooling inside the magnetic trap .",
    "the cloud is transferred to the hybrid trap consisting of the uv beam and a quadrupole magnetic trap ( qmt ) generated by a set of qmt coils in anti - helmholtz configuration .",
    "figure  [ fig : hybridtrap ] shows a schematic of this trap .",
    "the quadrupole field has a strong axis gradient of 0.54  gauss / cm but gravity acts in a direction perpendicular to this axis . in this direction",
    "the gradient is only half the magnitude which is well below the leviation gradient of @xmath59  @xcite . below this gradient gravity is stronger than the confining magnetic force so that atoms are not trapped in the absence of the uv beam .",
    "the qmt therefore adds confinement but does not contribute to the trap depth .",
    "a homogeneous magnetic field is applied with a set of fine - tune coils to minimize trap oscillations induced by the loading step .     with the magnetic field axis .",

    "the loss rate varies linearly with power , which is consistent with only background collisions and off - resonant scattering ; two - photon ionization would depend quadratically on power .",
    "a linear fit gives a slope of about 0.16(2 ) @xmath60 ( @xmath61 , see equation  [ eq : rates ] ) , with a background loss rate of 0.12(2 ) @xmath62 .",
    "this background loss rate is consistent with the loss rate of 0.13(1 ) @xmath62 in a hybrid trap of comparable depth using our 1557  nm odt for which off - resonant scattering is negligible  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : httemp ] shows the fitted temperature as a function of hold time in the hybrid trap .",
    "this temperature is not constant ; after a quick thermalization the cloud starts heating up .",
    "this heating may be caused by scattered atoms dumping a small portion of their high recoil energy in the atomic cloud . in principle",
    "it is also possible that a scattered atom is able to dump all of its energy in the cloud and thermalize instead of leaving the trap . at the highest observed heating rate @xmath63",
    ", this contributes no more than @xmath64 to the loss rate , negligible compared to other processes .    to give an estimate of the equilibrium temperature inside the trap ( in the absence of scattering ) we take",
    "the minimum achieved temperature as an upper bound , and a linear extrapolation of the heating to zero hold time as a lower bound . in this way we extract temperatures of @xmath65 and @xmath66 respectively .",
