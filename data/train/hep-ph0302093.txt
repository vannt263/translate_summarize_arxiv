    "lepton flavour violation is observed in atmospheric and solar neutrino experiments .",
    "the atmospheric neutrino deficit is mainly due to muon neutrino disappearance : the @xmath15 flux measured at super - kamiokande ( sk ) has a strong zenith angle dependence , which deviates from the standard model ( sm ) expectation by more than 7@xmath16 @xcite .",
    "neutrinos change flavors as they travel to the earth from the center of the sun , as was seen directly at the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) through the measurements of the charged current and the neutral current reactions for @xmath17 solar neutrinos @xcite .",
    "these results demonstrate simply that new physics is required . in principle , the atmospheric and solar neutrino deficits can be explained by neutrino masses or by giving the neutrinos new interactions .",
    "data disfavor non standard interactions ( nsi ) of neutrinos as an explanation for the atmospheric neutrino deficit @xcite through the energy and baseline dependence .",
    "kamland detector has recently confirmed the large mixing angle ( lma ) oscillation explanation of the solar neutrino puzzle@xcite .",
    "prior to this , nsi were a viable alternative solution@xcite .",
    "neutrino masses are the leading mechanism in the solar and atmospheric anomalies .",
    "nonetheless , nsi may be comparable to ( or larger than ) oscillation effects in other processes or at other energies .",
    "this is a particularly relevant issue for neutrino factories @xcite , where nsi may affect the oscillation parameters inferred from experimental data , biasing the value of some of the mixing angles .",
    "for instance , it was suggested in @xcite that nsi could interfere with the determination of @xmath18 at a neutrino factory .",
    "it is important to understand how significant is this possibility .",
    "the original aim of this paper was to show that short baseline and precision experiments are more sensitive to nsi than the far detector at a neutrino factory .",
    "we will see that this is true for some nsi , but borderline for those involving a @xmath10 .",
    "we consider neutral current nsi , from a phenomenological perspective : we follow @xcite , and assume that the new physics which induces the non - standard @xmath19 operator , where @xmath1 is a charged lepton ( @xmath20 ) or quark , does @xmath21 introduce new charged lepton physics at tree level . within this approach",
    ", nsi can be constrained @xcite from neutrino deep inelastic scattering experiments and from elastic scattering @xmath22 , where the baseline is too short for oscillations .",
    "nsi would contribute to @xmath9 scattering events , and therefore to the determination of @xmath23 in these experiments .",
    "so short baseline , high - flux neutrino experiments , that measure for instance @xmath23 , can set significant bounds on nsi involving @xmath8 and @xmath7 .    a @xmath19 operator ,",
    "will nonetheless induce a @xmath24 and/or @xmath25 operator , where @xmath26 is the su(2 ) partner of @xmath1 , via external one - loop standard model dressing .",
    "this is independent of the new physics that induces the @xmath19 operator . even in the case",
    "in which there are no tree level bounds on nsi of neutrinos , because there is no appropriate experiment , in general radiative corrections will generate other types of interactions which could be tested at present ( or future ) experiments .",
    "bounds on charged lepton operators therefore set model independent bounds on the nsi operators . however , at present these bounds are only significant for @xmath27 flavor changing operators , because the loop suppression is a small number .",
    "nsi in loops can also make flavour dependent contributions to the decay rates of the electroweak gauge bosons , which can set relevant bounds on flavour diagonal nsi",
    ".    present bounds still allow sizable ( diagonal ) nsi of @xmath10 , but we will show that they can be constrained by comparing sno / sk solar data and kamland results .",
    "the bounds are significantly better if kamland finds an oscillatory signal , that is if @xmath28 ev , as we will assume for definiteness .",
    "we introduce our notation and assumptions in section 2 .",
    "section 3 presents current constraints on flavour diagonal and flavour changing neutral current nsi , both from tree level effects ( short baseline , high - flux neutrino scattering experiments , lep , atmospheric neutrinos ) and from one - loop processes ( flavour changing charged lepton interactions , lep ) . in section 4",
    ", we discuss the sensitivity of solar neutrino experiments , sno and super - kamiokande , using kamland to pin - point the solar oscillation parameters , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "we also discuss the sensitivity of future experiments , using the near detector at a nufactory as an example .",
    "we summarize our results in section [ summary ] , tabulating the best current and future bounds we obtained .",
    "at energy scales @xmath31 ( where there is a large amount of precise @xmath9 scattering data ) , the standard model interactions of neutrinos can be described by the effective lagrangian _",
    "eff = - 2g_f ( [ |__l _ ] [ |f ^l f ] + ) - 2g_f _ p , f , g^f_p [ |__l _ ] [ |f ^p f ] [ sm ] where @xmath32 , @xmath20 is a charged lepton , @xmath1 is a lepton or quark , @xmath26 its su(2 ) partner , and the @xmath33 couplings @xmath34 are given in table  [ tab : gai ] .",
    "greek indices from the beginning of the alphabet ( @xmath35 ... ) label lepton flavours , roman indices ( @xmath36 ... ) correspond to neutrino mass eigenstates , and late alphabet greek letters ( @xmath37 ... ) are space - time indices .",
    "we consider non - standard , neutral current neutrino interactions , so we add operators with the form of the second term in equation ( [ sm ] ) .",
    "we do not include new charged current interactions .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , nsi can contribute to a `` neutrino oscillation '' signal via charged current interactions in the source or detector , or via neutral current interactions in the propagation from source to detector .",
    "however , we anticipate that other experimental processes are more sensitive to charged current nsi that long baseline neutrino oscillations ( _ e.g. _ flavour changing nsi in the source could induce taus and wrong sign muons in the near detector ) .",
    "@xmath38    non - renormalisable operators involving a standard model neutrino and anti - neutrino can be ordered by their dimension , or by their number of legs in the @xmath39 invariant effective theory of sm fermions and photons .",
    "these options are different , because higgs fields saturated by the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) are not counted as legs .",
    "if we count by legs , then new physics coupled to neutrinos can appear as a four fermion operator .",
    "we require this operator to conserve electric charge , colour and lepton number , which forces it to be of @xmath40 form .",
    "we assume three light neutrinos , with majorana masses and the sm interactions of equation ( [ sm ] ) .",
    "we allow them to have nsi , parametrised as _ eff^nsi = - ^fp _ 2 g_f ( | _ _ l _ )",
    "( |f ^p f ) [ eps ] where @xmath1 is now a first generation sm fermion : @xmath41 or @xmath42 , and @xmath43 or @xmath44 .",
    "we are not concerned with @xmath1 from the second or third generation , because such interactions could not affect oscillation experiments .",
    "we neglect possible cp violation in the new interactions ( this has been considered in @xcite ) , so we take @xmath45 . if the only new neutrino interactions are neutral current , the neutrino flavour basis is well - defined ( see @xcite ) , and we can label neutrinos by their sm flavour .    assuming that the four - fermion vertices of equation ( [ eps ] ) arise in an @xmath46 gauge invariant theory containing the sm spectrum with a single higgs doublet , they can be generated by operators of dimension six , eight and larger @xcite containing more and more vevs of the higgs doublet . in this paper",
    "we will not consider dimension seven @xmath47 = 2 operators @xcite because , unless their coupling is very small , we expect these interactions to generate too large neutrino majorana masses .",
    "there is an important difference between the dimension 6 and dimension 8 @xmath48 operators : new physics which induces the dimension 6 operator also induces an operator involving charged leptons , with a coefficient of the same order ( by @xmath3 invariance ) @xcite .",
    "charged lepton physics imposes tight constraints on these coefficients of dimension 6 operators . at dimension 8 ,",
    "an operator as in equation ( [ eps ] ) can appear at tree level , for instance as |e_r(h^^a ) ( | ^a h ) e_r - 1 2 h ^2 ( |e ^r e ) ( | _ l ) [ ex ] without any charged lepton counterpart @xcite . )",
    "are contracted @xmath49 .",
    "the @xmath16s carry gauge @xmath3 indices . ]",
    "we include the operator ( [ eps ] ) , and neglect the associated tree - level charged current vertex , so we are effectively assuming that these operators are generated at dimension eight .",
    "if new physics operators are generated at tree level by exchange of particles with mass @xmath50 , naive power counting tells us that dimension six operators should give rise to @xmath51 where @xmath52 is some generic coupling of the new physics particles .",
    "taking into account present data collected at lep and tevatron one can reasonably assume that @xmath53  gev . even though somehow lighter particles are not excluded ( _ e.g. _ if neutral or only produced in pairs or having small couplings with ordinary particles ) , we are using an effective lagrangian approach which is only valid below @xmath50 .",
    "this counting tells us that we expect @xmath54 for dimension 6 operators .",
    "if nsi interactions are generated by dimension 8 operators one expects an extra suppression proportional to @xmath55 which is only important if @xmath56 , therefore one naturally expects @xmath57 .",
    "however , @xmath52 could be relatively large without leaving the perturbative regime .",
    "thus , @xmath58 s order one are not completely unnatural if the scale of new physics is not extremely large and the couplings of new particles are large .",
    "it is , therefore , important to check how large these nsi can be on purely phenomenological grounds .",
    "thus , in this paper , we will concentrate on the phenomenology of @xmath59 invariant @xmath60 operators , with arbitrary coefficients . as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", there will nonetheless be constraints from charged lepton physics on these operators .",
    "one loop sm dressing of the tree level nsi vertices @xmath61 ( for instance exchanging a @xmath5 between the external legs ) , will _ necessarily _ induce @xmath62 and/or @xmath63 .",
    "this is discussed in section [ oneloop ] .    in the effective theory described by equations ( [ sm ] ) and ( [ eps ] )",
    ", there will normally be a number of four - fermion operators which can contribute to a process .",
    "experimental measurements of different processes will set limits on different sums of operators .",
    "it is common , in setting a limit on a given four - fermion operator , to assume that all other four - fermion operators are zero .",
    "this approach makes sense when the new physics contributions add incoherently,_cest  dire _ when one adds probabilities not amplitudes .",
    "it also makes sense if the different new physics amplitudes interfere with different sm amplitudes  for instance , if there is an nsi - sm interference term @xmath64 , these two terms can only cancel against each other if the nsi know @xmath23 .",
    "we consider this unlikely ( since we assume they are generated at dimension 8 , rather than 6 ) , so we quote limits on one @xmath58 at a time in our summary tables .",
    "we will assume that the only unknown new physics are the non - standard neutrino interactions .",
    "we calculate what current experiments should measure according to the sm , and require the nsi contribution to be less than the experimental error ( 1.6 @xmath16 ) , or less than the theory - experiment discrepancy .",
    "before considering particle physics bounds , let us discuss briefly astrophysical and cosmological bounds on neutrino nsi .",
    "neutrino interactions with matter , electrons and light quarks , can affect many astrophysical and cosmological scenarios .",
    "they could keep neutrinos in thermal equilibrium with ordinary matter for a longer time at the time of nucleosynthesis and disturb one of the great successes of modern cosmology .",
    "they could also produce stronger interactions of neutrinos with matter in the core of supernovae therefore keeping neutrinos trapped for a longer time and disturbing the duration of the neutrino pulse observed in sn1987a @xcite .",
    "they could also contribute to the energy loss of stars due to processes like plasmon decay ( @xmath65 ) which are determinant for the evolution of red giants .",
    "all these processes occur in the sm mediated by neutral or charged currents and the sm value is essential to understand the three scenarios mentioned . now the question is how large nsi are allowed in order not to disturb present observations ?",
    "for instance , the case of plasmon decay in red giants has been used to place stringent bounds on a possible neutrino magnetic moment@xcite .",
    "the sm gives contributions to plasmon decay from neutral and charged currents for @xmath8 and only from neutral currents for @xmath7 and @xmath10 . to destabilize the sm results",
    "one should modify some of these interactions by a factor larger than one@xcite .",
    "therefore , generically one can say that @xmath66 from energy loss in red giants .",
    "we expect , at best , similar results from supernova data or nucleosynthesis .",
    "as we will see , laboratory data already place better limits on @xmath8 and @xmath7 nsi , and sno , super - kamiokande and kamland will also improve the bounds for @xmath10 .",
    "we first consider tree level effects of the operators in ( [ eps ] ) , which contain only the neutrino current with either the electron or first generation quark currents .",
    "low energy scattering experiments can constrain nsi involving @xmath8 and @xmath7 , while to derive bounds on diagonal @xmath10 nsi one should use the measurement of the @xmath67 cross section at lep @xcite and atmospheric neutrino data @xcite .",
    "we set further bounds using the fact that such operators always induce one loop effects in much better tested charged lepton processes .",
    "these constrain flavor changing nsi involving first and second generation neutrinos to be undetectably small .",
    "neutrino nsi with either electrons or first generation quarks can be constrained by low energy scattering data .",
    "we review previous analysis @xcite and update them by including the recent results of the nutev experiment . as we shall see below , the bounds are rather stringent for @xmath7 interactions , looser for @xmath8 and do not exist for ( diagonal ) @xmath10",

    "the combined analysis leads to the following 90% cl bounds when both diagonal and flavour changing nsi are simultaneously present @xcite : -0.016 < ^dv _ < -0.009 0 < ^dv _ < 0.013 |^dv _ - ^dv_| < 0.03 although the fit has been done assuming only neutrino - down quark nsi similar results can be expected for the neutrino - electron and neutrino - up quark cases .",
    "this result leads to a stringent constraint on flavour changing four - fermion operators involving @xmath115 , and provides a complementary bound on diagonal nsi of @xmath10 with quarks , only loosely constrained by lep .      on general grounds we expect that interactions in which the @xmath116 are replaced by the corresponding leptons will be generated by one loop diagrams with virtual @xmath117 s .",
    "effective interactions , however , are nonrenormalizable and , therefore , a precise prescription has to be given in order to estimate these corrections .",
    "our point of view will be that these are originated from a more complete theory at scales @xmath118 which is renormalizable ( or perhaps finite ) and in which observables can be computed in terms of a few parameters .",

    "it is _ not _ a realistic example of the type of model we wish to constrain ( see _ e.g. _",

    "so the paschos - wolfenstein ratio : r_pw = is not available , and @xmath366 can not be so elegantly disentangled from parton distributions .",
    "it was conservatively estimated in @xcite that a neutrino factory could measure @xmath366 to one part in @xmath367 , via a ratio of the form r_^- & = & + & = & where @xmath368 is defined in eq.([eqnr ] ) , and the @xmath369 with lepton subscripts are as defined in equations ( [ gl2]),([gr2 ] ) , replacing @xmath370 as required .",
    "a similar ratio @xmath371 can be defined for the beam produced in the decay of a @xmath358 : r_^+ & = & + & = & @xmath371 and @xmath372 can be measured with equal sensitivity , so @xmath366 can be independently determined from both .",

    "this would occur via the external dressing of the four fermion operator with a @xmath5 loop , as discussed in section [ oneloop ] .",
    "for instance , exchanging a @xmath5 between the @xmath7 and @xmath376 legs of @xmath377 would generate the operator @xmath378 .",
    "this would produce a @xmath10 from @xmath379 decay , which could turn into a @xmath121 in cc scattering off quarks .",
    "the sensitivity of the near detector to operators of the form @xmath380 was estimated in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) to be 10 ^ -4 where @xmath381 is the number of @xmath121 events required in the detector for a signal .",
    "@xmath382 was taken in @xcite . for @xmath383 ,",
    "this is a weaker bound on @xmath384 than from measuring @xmath23 .",
    "however , in the opposite limit of @xmath385 ( for instance if the nsi are induced by dimension 6 operators ) , it is clear that flavour changing nsi are more readily detected via cc interactions than nc interactions .",
    "we have considered non - standard interactions of neutrinos with first generation leptons and quarks , parametrised as _",

    "[ epsinsum ] we have taken a phenomenological approach , assuming that the new physics which induces these non - standard neutral current operators does not generate the @xmath3 related charged lepton operators at tree level .",
    "this could be the case if the operators in ( [ epsinsum ] ) are of dimension eight or larger .",
    "then the tight bounds on charged lepton nsi do not apply , so we have assembled present and future constraints on such operators from purely neutrino processes .",
    "we point out though , that even if only neutrino neutral current nsi are present at tree level , they will necessarily induce the related vertices with charged leptons at one loop , via @xmath5 exchange .",
    "moreover , radiative corrections involving these neutrino nsi could affect a variety of precision observables .",
    "thus we have also set bounds on the strength of the nsi in ( [ epsinsum ] ) from their one loop effects , which in some cases are more stringent than the tree level ones .",
    "our results are summarized in tables [ tab : ffopt ] and [ tab : fcffv ] .",

    "we have collected present constraints , including the recent nutev data , and estimated future limits attainable at the near detector of a neutrino factory from measuring @xmath6 ( both , leptonically and in neutrino dis ) .",
    "we found that these experiments are more sensitive to @xmath387 and @xmath388 than the @xmath9factory far detector .",
    "they also provide the best bounds on flavour changing interactions involving @xmath10 .    one loop bounds on lepton flavour",
    "violating operators are very stringent for @xmath389 .",
    "the present experimental limits are so strong , that even with the loop suppression , the @xmath389 are constrained to be @xmath390 .",
    "the analogous bounds on @xmath391 ( @xmath392 ) from several tau decays are just order one , although the experimental limits on some of these decays could improve , in which case the relevant bound can be rescaled . regarding flavour diagonal nsi , one loop bounds on @xmath393 from the precise measurement of @xmath394 at lep are of the same order as the tree level limits from @xmath395 , while the limits on @xmath396 from the invisible @xmath33 width are the only constraints from laboratory data .",
    "finally , we have estimated future bounds from comparing kamland and solar neutrino data .",
    "these could constrain @xmath397 at the level of @xmath398 ( which is roughly one order of magnitude improvement of the present limits ) , and set bounds on @xmath393 which are comparable to those from lep .",
    "we hoped to show that long - baseline experiments at a neutrino factory would indeed measure oscillation parameters , since nsi would be seen first in other experiments , like short baseline , high intensity , precision neutrino scattering experiments .",
    "to what degree have we succeeded ?",
    "suppose that no evidence for nsi is found ; does this mean such interactions can be ignored in long baseline oscillation experiments ?",
    "that is , if the near detector of a neutrino factory sees no nsi , will the far detector measure oscillation parameters ?",

    "the error on the dis determination of @xmath23 could be significantly smaller than estimated in @xcite , because the source of error is the parton distribution functions , and the near detector will measure these @xcite . so the near detector might indeed be able to constrain @xmath405 .",

    "the bounds on non - standard neutrino interactions ( nsi ) are affected as follows : there are finite contributions of the same order , but unlike the leading log , the corrections are renormalisation scheme - dependent .",
    "the scheme dependence can be cancelled by matching corrections at the high scale , which are model dependent .",
    "model and scheme independent bounds could be obtained by performing a nlo calculation .",
