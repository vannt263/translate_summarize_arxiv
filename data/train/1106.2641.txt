    "<S> * in the search for the mechanism of high - temperature superconductivity , intense research has been focused on the evolution of the spin excitation spectrum upon doping from the antiferromagnetic insulating to the superconducting states of the cuprates.@xcite because of technical limitations , the experimental investigation of doped cuprates has been largely focused on low - energy excitations in a small range of momentum space.@xcite here we use resonant inelastic x - ray scattering  @xcite to show that a large family of superconductors , encompassing underdoped yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 and overdoped yba@xmath0cu@xmath3o@xmath4 , exhibits damped spin excitations ( paramagnons ) with dispersions and spectral weights closely similar to those of magnons in undoped cuprates . the comprehensive experimental description of this surprisingly simple spectrum permits quantitative tests of magnetic cooper pairing models . </S>",
    "<S> a numerical solution of the eliashberg equations for the magnetic spectrum of yba@xmath0cu@xmath3o@xmath4 reproduces its superconducting transition temperature within a factor of two , a level of agreement comparable to eliashberg theories of conventional superconductors .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite *    the twenty - fifth anniversary of the discovery of high - temperature superconductivity is approaching without a clear and compelling theory of the mechanism underlying this phenomenon . after the discovery of an unconventional ( @xmath5-wave ) symmetry of the cooper pair wave function in the copper oxides , </S>",
    "<S> the thrust of research has been focused on the role of repulsive coulomb interactions between conduction electrons , which naturally explain this pairing symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> however , since even simple models based on repulsive interactions have thus far defied a full solution , the question of whether such interactions alone can generate high - temperature superconductivity is still open . a complementary </S>",
    "<S> , more empirical approach has asked whether antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations , which are a generic consequence of coulomb interactions , can mediate cooper pairing in analogy to the phonon - mediated pairing mechanism in conventional superconductors  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario requires the existence of well - defined antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations in the superconducting range of the cuprate phase diagram ( for mobile hole concentrations @xmath6 per copper atom ) , well outside the narrow stability range of antiferromagnetic long - range order ( @xmath7 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> an extensive series of experiments using inelastic spin - flip scattering of neutrons has indeed revealed low - energy spin fluctuations in doped cuprates  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> signatures of coupling between spin and charge excitations have also been identified  @xcite , and evidence has been reported that this coupling is strong enough to mediate superconductivity in underdoped cuprates .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite however , for cuprate compounds hosting the most robust superconducting states , namely those that are optimally doped to exhibit @xmath8 k , inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) experiments have thus far mostly revealed spin excitations over a narrow range of excitation energies @xmath9 mev , wave vectors @xmath10 covering only @xmath11 % of the brillouin zone area around the antiferromagnetic ordering wave vector @xmath12 , and temperatures @xmath13  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the energy- and momentum - integrated intensity of these excitations constitutes only a few percent of the spectral weight of spin waves in antiferromagnetically ordered cuprates  @xcite , and is thus clearly insufficient to support high-@xmath14 superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> although the recent discovery of a weakly dispersive magnetic excitation in the model system hgba@xmath0cuo@xmath15 with @xmath16 mev may account for some of the missing spectral weight  @xcite , the apparent weakness of antiferromagnetic fluctuations in optimally doped compounds has been used as a central argument against magnetically mediated pairing scenarios for the cuprates @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> this picture is , however , strongly influenced by technical limitations of the ins method that arise from the small cross section of magnetic neutron scattering in combination with the weak primary flux of currently available high - energy neutron beams . because of intensity constraints , </S>",
    "<S> even the detection of undamped spin waves in antiferromagnetically ordered cuprates over their full band width of @xmath17 mev has required single - crystal samples with volumes of order 10 @xmath18 , which are very difficult to obtain  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> doping further reduces the intensity of the ins profiles and exacerbates these difficulties .    here </S>",
    "<S> we take advantage of recent progress in the development of high - resolution resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) in order to explore magnetic excitations in a wide energy - momentum window that has been largely hidden from view by ins . </S>",
    "<S> experiments on undoped cuprates have shown that rixs with photon energies at the cu @xmath19 absorption edge is sensitive to single - magnon excitations  @xcite by virtue of the strong spin - orbit coupling of the @xmath20 core - hole intermediate state  @xcite , in excellent agreement with ins measurements  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> initial rixs experiments on doped la@xmath21sr@xmath22cuo@xmath1 have revealed a complex two - component lineshape with excitations extending up to about 350 mev ; the presence of two branches was attributed to phase separation between the superconducting state and a competing state with incommensurate spin and charge orde r  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have applied the same method to yba@xmath0cu@xmath3o@xmath23 ( ybco@xmath23 ) , nd@xmath24ba@xmath25cu@xmath3o@xmath23 ( ndbco@xmath23 ) , and yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 , which are much less affected by doping - induced disorder and do not show phase separation  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> although one can not reach @xmath26 with rixs , one of its great advantages over ins is that it allows measurements of magnetic excitations with sizable intensity over much of the accessible reciprocal space , even on very small sample volumes . </S>",
    "<S> the results presented here have been obtained on thin films and on millimeter - sized single crystals far below the volume requirements of ins ( see supplementary information ) . </S>",

    "<S> , we can see in both compounds an inelastic feature centered around 250 mev and a resolution - limited elastic peak .    for undoped antiferromagnetic ndbco@xmath27 </S>",
    "<S> , we can decompose the response in the mid - infrared ( mir ) region of the spectra ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1e ) for energy losses below @xmath35 500 mev following the method employed in ref . . </S>",
    "<S> in the @xmath29 scattering geometry , this leads to ( i ) an intense resolution - limited peak around 250 mev , ( ii ) a high - energy tail of this peak centered around 400 mev , and ( iii ) a weak low - energy contribution around 100 mev . in the @xmath30 scattering geometry , </S>",
    "<S> feature ( i ) is strongly suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> this polarization dependence allows us to assign this feature to a single - magnon excitation , in agreement with theoretical considerations  @xcite and previous investigations on other cuprates  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this assignment is further confirmed by the disappearance of the mir inelastic response as the incident photon energy is moved away from the cu-@xmath19 ab sorption edge ( not shown ) . the weak features ( ii ) and ( iii ) </S>",
    "<S> are associated with higher - order spin excitations and lattice vibrations ( single and multiple phonon excitations that are not individually resolved ) , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> the energy of the single - magnon feature in ndbco@xmath27 depends strongly on @xmath31 ( left panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) . since the lineshape of the mir spectrum is @xmath31-independent , the fitting procedure described above can be used to obtain the magnon dispersion relation . </S>",
    "<S> the result displayed in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3a is clearly different from the sinusoidal magnon dispersion observed in la@xmath0cuo@xmath1  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , due to the presence of two antiferromagnetically coupled cuo@xmath0 layers per unit cell , two magnon branches with different spin precession patterns are expected  @xcite for ndbco@xmath27 : an acoustic branch with intensity @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the momentum transfer perpendicular to the cuo@xmath0 layers and @xmath5 is the spacing between the two cuo@xmath0 layers , and an optical branch with intensity @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> the result of the calculation of the relative intensities of these two branches for our scattering geometry is displayed in the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3a . </S>",
    "<S> it shows that close to the brillouin zone center the gapped optical branch dominates . </S>",
    "<S> fitting our data using the spin - wave dispersion calculated for a bilayer in the framework of a simple heisenberg model  @xcite , we obtain @xmath39=133 @xmath40 2 mev and @xmath41=12 @xmath40 3 mev for the intra- and inter - layer exchange constants , respectively , in excellent agreement with the values obtained in antiferromagnetic ybco@xmath23  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to the doped systems . </S>",
    "<S> figure  2 provides a synopsis of the experimental spectra for all systems investigated here , which span a wide range of doping levels : undoped ndbco@xmath27 , strongly underdoped ndbco@xmath28 and ybco@xmath42 ( @xmath43 = 65 k and 61 k , respectively ) , weakly underdoped yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath44 </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath43 = 80 k ) , and weakly overdoped ybco@xmath28 ( @xmath43 = 90 k ) . because of their stoichiometric composition and electronic homogeneity , the latter two compounds have served as model compounds in the experimental literature on high-@xmath43 superconductivity , but apart from the `` resonant mode '' that appears in ybco@xmath28 below @xmath43 @xcite no information has been available on their magnetic excitation spectra . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 shows that broad mir features are present at all doping levels in the same energy range as the single - magnon peak in undoped ndbco@xmath27 . since these features obey the same polarization dependence as the magnon mode ( figs . 1 f , h ) </S>",
    "<S> , they can be assigned to magn etic excitations .    </S>",
    "<S> based on the metallic nature of the doped cuprates , one expects strong damping of magnetic excitations in the stoner continuum of incoherent electron - hole excitations . </S>",
    "<S> we have therefore fitted these spectra to voigt profiles that are the result of the convolution of the lorentzian lineshape of excitations with finite lifetime with the gaussian resolution function . since the fits yield excellent agreement with this simple profile ( solid lines in figs . 1 and 2 ) </S>",
    "<S> , we can accurately extract the energies and half - widths - at - half - maximum ( hwhm ) of the magnetic excitation as a function of the transferred momentum ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3b , c ) . before discussing these results , it is interesting to compare them to those previously reported on underdoped la@xmath21sr@xmath22cuo@xmath1  @xcite . as no double - peak structure </S>",
    "<S> is observed here , our data confirm the absence of phase separation in the ybco and ndbco families of compounds @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic excitation energies of ndbco@xmath28 , ybco@xmath42 , and ybco@xmath28 at the brillouin zone boundary are nearly identical to the ones found in ndbco@xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the in - plane exchange constant @xmath39 is not as strongly renormalized with doping as previously suggested based on extrapolation of lower - energy ins data  @xcite , in agreement with the most recent ins findings on ybco@xmath45 using high energy neutrons  @xcite . upon approaching the @xmath46 point ( @xmath47 ) </S>",
    "<S> , we observe that the dispersion in the doped compounds is steeper than in ndbco@xmath27 . despite the fact that @xmath46 and @xmath12 are no longer equivalent in the absence of magnetic long - range order , the rixs data obtained on ybco@xmath42 nicely extrapolate to the low - energy `` hour glass '' dispersion around @xmath12 previously extracted from ins data on samples prepared in an identical manner  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since the slope of the upward - dispersing branch close to the magnetic zone center is flatter than the one of the antiferromagnetic spin - wave dispersion  @xcite , this indicates the presence of an inflexion point in the dispersion of magnetic excitations in the doped compounds . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the situation seems somewhat different for yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath44 , where the energy of the magnetic excitations close to the zone boundary is significantly reduced compared to the other systems ( @xmath35 210 mev instead of @xmath35 300 mev ) , and the dispersion is flatter than in ndbco@xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> this may reflect different values of @xmath39 and @xmath41 in this system , and deserves further investigation . </S>",
    "<S> the intrinsic hwhm of @xmath35 200 mev of the inelastic signal extracted from our data ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3c ) is much larger than the instrumental resolution and comparable to the magnon energies , indicating strong damping by stoner excitations . </S>",
    "<S> the damping rate does not change substantially with @xmath31 and with doping . </S>",
    "<S> finally , while it is not possible yet to obtain absolute magnetic intensities from rixs data , we can extract the relative intensity of the rixs profiles by integrating the inelastic signal in the mir region ( see supplementary information ) . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the integrated intensity obtained in this way is conserved upon doping from the antiferromagnetic insulator to the slightly overdoped superconductor .    </S>",
    "<S> we have thus demonstrated the existence of paramagnons , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ damped but well - defined , dispersive magnetic excitations , deep in the stoner continuum of cuprates with doping levels beyond optimal doping . </S>",
    "<S> their spectral weights are similar to those of spin waves in the undoped , antiferromagnetically ordered parent material .    in order to obtain insight into the origin of this surprising observation , </S>",
    "<S> we have performed exact - diagonalization calculations of the @xmath48 hamiltonian with @xmath49 on finite - sized clusters , following the method proposed in refs . . </S>",
    "<S> we used clusters with 18 and 20 spins arranged in various shapes to map the ( h , k,0 ) reciprocal plane with sufficient momentum resolution ( see supplementary information ) . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting spectra were convoluted by a gaussian function with hwhm @xmath50 in order to simulate the experimental resolution function . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated imaginary part of the spin susceptibility is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4a for different hole concentrations . in the undoped case </S>",
    "<S> , one can observe two peaks in the imaginary part of the spin susceptibility : an intense peak corresponding to the single - magnon excitation , and a weaker feature at higher energy corresponding to higher - order processes . </S>",
    "<S> the single - magnon peak clearly disperses , although its energy is slightly above the value expected from linear spin - wave theory ( dotted lines ) , due to the finite size of the cluster . in the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4a , we present the energy - integrated magnetic intensity in the ( h , k,0 ) reciprocal plane . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , the intensity for in the u ndoped situation is strongly peaked at @xmath12 , and rather uniformly distributed in the rest of the plane . </S>",
    "<S> as holes are added to the clusters , the magnetic spectral weight strongly decreases only around @xmath12 , but remains essentially constant everywhere else . </S>",
    "<S> this can also be seen in fig .  4b , where the imaginary part of the energy - integrated spin susceptibility is plotted as a function of doping . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental and numerical data are thus in excellent agreement .    </S>",
    "<S> armed with essentially complete knowledge of the spin fluctuation spectrum , and motivated by the agreement with the numerical data for the @xmath48 model , we now estimate the superconducting transition temperature @xmath43 generated by a cooper pairing mechanism in which the experimentally detected spin fluctuations play the role of bosonic glue . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , we have self - consistently solved the eliashberg equations using the vertex function of the @xmath48 model @xcite and the experimental spin fluctuation spectrum of ybco@xmath28 ( inset in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4c ) , without adjustable parameters . </S>",
    "<S> details are given in the supplementary information . </S>",
    "<S> figure 4c shows the outcome of the calculation . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting @xmath43 of 170 k is similar to the maximum @xmath43 observed in the cuprates and to another recent estimate based on the comparison of ins and photoemission data on underdoped ybco@xmath23 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement with the experimentally observed @xmath43 of ybco@xmath28 is satisfa ctory in view of the neglect of vertex corrections beyond eliashberg theory and other simplifying assumptions in the calculation , and in view of a similar level of quantitative agreement reported for eliashberg calculations of conventional low-@xmath43 superconductors .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in order to resolve the relative contribution of the strongly doping dependent region around @xmath12 and the high - energy part of the spin susceptibility revealed by rixs to the pairing strength , we have introduced momentum cutoffs around @xmath12 in the calculation ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4c ) . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , both low- and high - energy spin fluctuations contribute substantially to the pairing . in underdoped cuprates with lower gaps and stronger antiferromagnetic correlations , </S>",
    "<S> vertex corrections are expected to become essential  @xcite , reducing the @xmath43 values calculated here . </S>",
