    "extensive empirical data analysis of big price movements in the financial markets confirms the assumption that volatility itself is a stochastic variable or more generally the function of a stochastic variable @xcite . by analogy with physics",
    "we can assume that speculative prices @xmath2 change in a `` random medium '' described by the random diffusion coefficient .",
    "such analogy may be reversible from the point that the complex models of stochastic price movements can be applicable for the description of complex physical systems such as stochastic resonance , noise induced phase transitions and high energy physics applications .",
    "this analogy contributes to further development of statistical mechanics - nonextensive one and superstatistics have been introduced @xcite .",
    "additive - multiplicative stochastic models of the financial mean - reverting processes provide rich spectrum of shapes for the probability distribution function ( pdf ) depending on the model parameters @xcite .",
    "such stochastic processes model the empirical pdf s of volatility , volume and price returns with success when the appropriate fitting parameters are selected .",
    "nevertheless , there is the necessity to select the most appropriate stochastic models able to describe volatility as well as other variables under the dynamical aspects and the long range correlation aspects .",
    "there is empirical evidence that trading activity , trading volume , and volatility are stochastic variables with the long - range correlation @xcite and this key aspect is not accounted for in widespread models .",
    "moreover , rather often there is evidence that the models proposed are characterized only by the short - range time memory @xcite .",
    "phenomenological descriptions of volatility , known as heteroscedasticity , have proven to be of extreme importance in the option price modeling @xcite .",
    "autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity ( arch ) processes and more sophisticated structures garch are proposed as linear dependencies on previous values of squared returns and variances @xcite .",
    "these models based on empirically fitted parameters fail in reproducing power law behavior of the volatility autocorrelation function .",
    "we do believe that the stochastic models with the limited number of parameters and minimum stochastic variables are possible and would better reflect the market dynamics and its response to the external noise .",
    "recently we investigated analytically and numerically the properties of stochastic multiplicative point processes @xcite , derived formula for the power spectrum and related the model with the general form of multiplicative stochastic differential equation @xcite .",
    "preliminary the comparison of the model with the empirical data of spectrum and probability distribution of stock market trading activity @xcite stimulated us to work on the definition of more detailed model .",
    "the extensive empirical analysis of the financial market data , supporting the idea that the long - range volatility correlations arise from trading activity , provides valuable background for further development of the long - ranged memory stochastic models @xcite .",
    "we will present the stochastic model of trading activity with the long - range correlation and will investigate its connection to the stochastic modeling of volatility and returns .",
    "earlier we proposed the stochastic point process model , which reproduced a variety of self - affine time series exhibiting the power spectral density @xmath0 scaling as power of the frequency @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the time interval between point events in this model fluctuates as a stochastic variable described by the multiplicative iteration equation @xmath3 here interevent time @xmath4 between subsequent events @xmath5 and @xmath6 fluctuates due to the random perturbation by a sequence of uncorrelated normally distributed random variable @xmath7 with the zero expectation and unit variance , @xmath8 denotes the standard deviation of the white noise and @xmath9 is a coefficient of the nonlinear damping .",

    "we will investigate how the proposed modulated poisson stochastic point process can be adjusted to model trading activity with the empirically defined statistical properties . detrended fluctuation analysis @xcite is one of the methods to define the second order statistics , the autocorrelation of trading activity .",
    "the histogram of the detrended fluctuation analysis exponents @xmath49 obtained by fits for each of the 1000 us stocks shows a relatively narrow spread of @xmath49 around the mean value @xmath50 @xcite .",

    "the histogram of exponents obtained by fits to the cumulative distributions of trading activites of 1000 us stocks @xcite gives the value of exponent @xmath53 describing the power - law behavior of the trading activity .",
    "empirical values of @xmath52 and @xmath54 confirm that the time series of the trading activity in real markets are fractal with the power law statistics .",
    "time series generated by stochastic process are fractal in the same sense .",
    "nevertheless , we face serious complications trying to adjust model parameters to the empirical data of the financial markets . for the pure multiplicative model ,",
    "when @xmath55 or @xmath56 , we have to take @xmath57 to get @xmath52 and @xmath58 to get @xmath54 , i.e. it is impossible to reproduce the empirical pdf and power spectrum with the same relaxation parameter @xmath41 and exponent of multiplicativity @xmath43 .",
    "we have proposed possible solution of this problem in our previous publications @xcite deriving pdf for the trading activity @xmath59 @xmath60    when @xmath61 this yields exactly the required value of @xmath62 and @xmath52 for @xmath57 .",
    "nevertheless , we can not accept this as the sufficiently accurate model of the trading activity as the empirical power law distribution is achieved only for very high values of the trading activity .",
    "probably this reveals the mechanism how the power law distribution converges to normal distribution through the growing values of the exponent , but empirically observed power law distribution in wide area of @xmath59 values can not be reproduced .",

    "moreover , only the smallest values of @xmath15 or high values of @xmath34 contribute to the power spectral density of trading activity @xcite .",
    "this suggests us to combine the point process with two values of @xmath43 : ( i ) @xmath65 for the main area of diffusing @xmath15 and @xmath34 and ( ii ) @xmath55 for the lowest values of @xmath15 or highest values of @xmath34 .",

    "we present the power spectral density calculated for the equivalent processes and ( see @xcite for details of calculations ) .",
    "this approach reveals the structure of the power spectral density in wide range of frequencies and shows that the model exhibits not one but rather two separate power laws with the exponents @xmath70 and @xmath71 . from many numerical calculations performed with the multiplicative point processes we can conclude that combination of two power laws of spectral density arise only when multiplicative noise is a crossover of two power laws , see and .",
    "we will show in the next section that this may serve as an explanation of two exponents of the power spectrum in the empirical data of volatility for ` s&p 500 ` companies @xcite .",
    "empirical data of the trading activity statistics must be modeled by the integrated flow of event @xmath59 defined in the time interval @xmath72 . in figure  [ fig:2 ]",
    "we demonstrate the cumulative probability distribution functions @xmath73 calculated from the histogram of @xmath74 generated by eq . with increasing time interval @xmath47 .",
    "this illustrates how distribution of the integrated signal @xmath59 converges to the normal distribution ( the central limit theorem ) through growing exponent of the power - law distribution and provides an evidence that the empirically observed exponent @xmath54 of the power - law distribution of @xmath59 @xcite can be explained by the proposed model with the same parameters suitable for description of the power spectrum of the trading activity .",
    "the power spectrum of the trading activity @xmath59 can be calculated by the fast fourier transform of the generated numerical series . as illustrated in figure  [ fig:3 ] , the exponents @xmath52 of the power spectrum are independent of @xmath47 and reproduce the empirical results of the detrended fluctuation analysis @xcite .",

    "here we refer to the theory of price diffusion as a mechanistic random process @xcite . for this idealized model",
    "the short term price diffusion depends on the limit order removal and this way is related to the market order flow .",
    "furthermore , the empirical analysis confirms that the volatility calculated for the fixed number of transactions has the long memory properties as well and it is correlated with real time volatility @xcite .",
    "we accumulate all these results into strong assumption that standard deviation @xmath91 may be proportional to the square root of the trading activity , i.e. , @xmath92 .",

    "we see that proposed model enables us to catch up the main features of the volatility : the power law distribution with exponent @xmath102 and power spectral density with two exponents @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "this is in a good agreement with the empirical data @xcite .",
    "earlier proposed stochastic point process model @xcite as a possible model of trading activity in the financial markets has to be elaborated .",

    "more precise model definition enables us to reproduce power spectral density with two different scaling exponents .",
