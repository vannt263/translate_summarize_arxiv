    "with the discovery of two - dimensional ultra - relativistic material  graphene , many exotic phenomena have found their wonderland , and can further be realized in simple table - top experiments.@xcite beyond graphene , three - dimensional ultra - relativistic materials , dubbed dirac semimetals , have been predicted and confirmed recently.@xcite the energy dispersion is linear near the band touching points ( dirac points ) , which is protected by the crystalline symmetry .",
    "when either the time - reversal symmetry or the inversion symmetry is broken , the dirac semimetals ( dsms ) evolve into the weyl semimetals ( wsms ) , in which low energy weyl fermions are embedded.@xcite both dsms and wsms are called topological semimetals ( tsms ) . like the dsms",
    ", wsms also have linear energy dispersion near the band touching nodes ( weyl nodes ) .",
    "importantly , the weyl nodes can be viewed as magnetic monopoles in k - space , and generate the berry curvature @xmath0.@xcite due to the transverse anomalous velocity @xmath1,@xcite a host of novel transport phenomena can happen in wsms , such as the chiral magnetic effect , the topological imbert - fedorov effect , etc.@xcite .",
    "the weyl semimetal state has been confirmed by photoemission and magneto - transport experiments in the noncentrosymmetric taas family of compounds.@xcite    all of the transport experiments confirmed two striking universal features of the tsms : ( i ) the negative magnetoresistance when the magnetic field is parallel to the electric field,@xcite and ( ii ) the ultrahigh mobility in the tsms systems.@xcite the negative magnetoresistance feature has been predicted theoretically , which is caused by the chiral anomaly effect in wsms .",
    "however , the physical mechanism that leads to the ultrahigh mobility remains puzzling .",
    "the mobility is determined by the transport lifetime @xmath2 .",
    "conventionally , @xmath3 is regarded as the same order as the quantum lifetime ( or single particle scattering time ) @xmath4.@xcite in the case of two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in gaas / algaas , the ratio @xmath5 can be large ( @xmath6 ) because the scattering centers are separated from the carriers.@xcite the charge fluctuations in the dopant layer lead only to small - angle scatterings , which strongly limit @xmath7 but hardly affect @xmath3.@xcite unexpectedly , a recent experiment showed that the ratio @xmath8 can be as large as @xmath9 in tsm.@xcite if @xmath7 is assumed to be of normal magnitude , large ratio @xmath8 implies ultrahigh mobility in tsm .",
    "however , there is no obvious separation of the scattering centers from the conduction electrons in tsm , yet @xmath8 is much larger .",
    "there should exist an unknown mechanism that strongly suppresses the backscattering .    in this paper , we address the unknown mechanism that leads to the ultrahigh mobility in the tsms .",
    "first , we show that a chirality - protected shift occurs in the wave - packet scattering process .",
    "our result shows that the chirality - protected shift reaches its maximum in the backscattering case .",
    "second , we discuss how the shift modifies the effective impact parameter of the wave packet , and thereby results in the anomalous scattering probability .",
    "third , to validate the argument we made , we present a full quantum calculation on the wave - packet scattering process , and the results are consistent with our semiclassical argument . at last , we calculate the transport lifetime @xmath3 and the quantum lifetime @xmath7 .",

    "when one views the scattering process in the z direction , the momentum direction of the outgoing wave forms a texture , and the radius of the texture is the chirality - protected shift . for weyl fermions with chirality @xmath14 ,",

    ", there can also be a longitudinal shift in the wave - packet scattering process .",
    "however , the longitudinal shift should not contribute to the total angular momentum , and we do not consider it here . because of the rotational symmetry about the z axis , the z component of the total angular momentum should be conserved in the wave - packet scattering process , by which the transverse shift can be obtained . because of the massless nature of weyl fermions , the chirality is the same as the helicity , which can be understood as the projection of the spin angular momentum to the canonical momentum .",

    "this indicates that only small - angle scatterings are possible in the wave - packet scattering process in wsms .",
    "we remark that the physical mechanism of the ultrahigh mobility in topological semimetals is different from that in gaas - based 2deg.@xcite in the appendices , we also calculate the wave - packet scattering for the dirac fermions in graphene .",
    "the scattering probability is still exponentially decayed with the increase of the impact parameter @xmath42 , i.e. , @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the scattering cross section for dirac fermions .",
    "notably , there is no chirality - protected shift @xmath12 for the dirac fermions in graphene .",
    "previously , we discussed that the chirality - protected shift could lead to the anomalous scattering probability . to validate this argument , we perform the full quantum calculation on the wave - packet scattering problem . notably ,",
    "the two valleys in weyl semimetals are usually separated with a large momentum difference . in our paper",
    ", we use the born approximation to deal with the coulombic impurity scattering problem .",
    "the inter - node scattering requires large momentum transfer , which will seldom happen due to the long range feature of the coulomb potential . as a contrast",
    ", we firstly calculate the scattering cross section for the plane - wave scattering process in wsms .",
    "assume that the plane wave is incident in the z direction , which is expressed as @xmath58 .",
    "the incident plane wave is scattered by a single impurity with the potential @xmath59 . using the first born approximation ,",

    "the angle @xmath10 is the scattering angle satisfying @xmath67 .",
    "next , we consider the wave - packet scattering process .",
    "the wave packet is described by the gaussian distribution @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the width of the wave packet in k space , and @xmath70 is the mean wave vector.@xcite we assume that the wave packet is incident in the z direction , and is scattered by an impurity @xmath21 located at the origin of the coordinate system .",
    "the general eigenfunction of the hamiltonian [ eq.(1 ) ] is @xmath71 , with the angles @xmath72 and @xmath73 characterizing the propagating direction of the plane wave .",
    "therefore , the incident wave packet can be expressed as @xmath74 @xmath75 is the initial position of the wave packet , and @xmath76 is the propagating velocity of the incident wave packet . in deriving the above expression , we used the approximation @xmath77 ( see the appendices ) .",

    "consequently , the probability of observing a scattered particle in the time interval @xmath90@xmath91 is @xmath93 .",

    "strikingly , we find that @xmath12 is exactly the chirality - protected shift we previously obtained by the angular momentum conservation method .",
    "this result strongly supports the validity of our argument on the wave - packet scattering , i.e , the chirality - protected transverse shift modifies the impact parameter effectively , and thereby leads to the anomalous scattering probability of the wave packet .",
    "the quantum lifetime and transport lifetime are two important time scales in condensed matter physics . the quantum lifetime @xmath7 measures the inter - collision events in all directions , which can be obtained from the shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) oscillations .",
    "in contrast , the transport lifetime @xmath2 measures the collision events in one particular direction , which can be obtained from the conductivity.@xcite conventionally , the quantum lifetime and the transport lifetime are usually of the same order . however , in ref.@xcite , the authors find that the ratio between the transport lifetime and quantum lifetime can be as large as @xmath97 in tsms . indeed ,",
    "almost all of the transport measurements of the tsms show the ultrahigh mobility , which challenges our consensus.@xcite in the tsms , for instance , the  ideal \" @xmath98 lattice , there are 64 sites for @xmath99 ions in each unit cell , and that exactly @xmath100 of the sites are vacant , which can easily attract impurities and act as the scattering centers.@xcite this means that even in the  ideal \" @xmath98 material , the mobility should be severely suppressed by the presence of the vacancies .",
    "remarkably , the puzzled ultrahigh mobility can be explained in the wave - packet scattering scenario .",
    "for example , in the case of zero impact parameter(@xmath101 ) , the chirality - protected shift @xmath12 reaches its maximum leading to the infinitely large effective impact parameter @xmath102 , which strongly suppresses the backscattering . in the plane - wave scattering scenario",
    ", the quantum lifetime is obtained from the scattering cross section , i.e. @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the fermi velocity , @xmath105 is the impurity concentration .",
    "by contrast , the transport lifetime is @xmath106 .",
    "@xmath107 is the ratio between the transport lifetime and quantum lifetime in the plane - wave scattering process . in analogy with the lifetime",
    "defined above , we can define the quantum lifetime and transport lifetime in the wave - packet scattering process . in the wave - packet scattering process",
    ", the scattering cross section is replaced by the scattering probability , i.e. @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the cutoff of the impact parameter decided by the density of the impurities ( see the appendices ) .",
    "therefore , one can define the quantum lifetime and transport lifetime : @xmath110 the ratio between the transport lifetime and the quantum lifetime is @xmath111 .",
    "we calculate the quantum lifetime , transport lifetime and the ratio @xmath8 .",
    "assume the density of the impurities is about @xmath112 .",
    "to ensure the single impurity scattering process , we set the impact parameter cutoff as @xmath113 , which is the half of the average distance between the two nearest impurities . fig .",
    "2(a ) shows the transport lifetime and quantum lifetime , which saturate at large fermi energy .",
    "2(b ) shows the ratio @xmath8 versus the fermi energy for wave - packet scattering and plane - wave scattering , respectively . in fig .",
    "2(b ) , the ratio @xmath8 increases steeply when the fermi energy approaching to the weyl nodes , and is saturated at large fermi energy.@xcite the large ratio @xmath8 indicates that the impurities can strongly limit @xmath7 but hardly affect @xmath3 , which is the physical mechanism of the ultrahigh mobility in tsms .     and transport lifetime @xmath2 vs the fermi energy @xmath114 in wsms .",
    "@xmath115 is the unit of the y axis .",
    "( b ) the blue solid line is the lifetime ratio @xmath5 in the wave - packet scattering process , whereas the red dashed line is the lifetime ratio @xmath116 obtained from the plane - wave scattering.[fig:2],width=317 ]    in experiment , the exact impurity density is not easy to identify , but can be quantitatively identified .",
    "therefore , we calculate how the impurity density @xmath117 influences the quantum lifetime @xmath7 and transport lifetime @xmath118 .",
    "since the cutoff of the impact parameter is decided by the impurity density , the variation of the impurity density affects both the quantum lifetime and the transport lifetime .",
    "3 shows how the quantum lifetime and the transport lifetime change with the impurity density .",

    "before the conclusion , we make several remarks on our work in this section .",
    "( i ) side jump effect : the chirality - protected shift is reminiscent of the side jump effect in spin - orbit coupling systems.@xcite however , the chirality - protected shift is very nontrivial because of the divergence of the berry curvature near the weyl points . in this paper",
    ", we study the impurity scattering effect of the weyl fermions . in the backscattering case",
    ", the shift tends to infinity leading to vanished scattering probability , which is the reason for the ultrahigh mobility .",
    "( ii ) wave - packet width : there are several important length scales , including the wave - packet width @xmath45 , impact parameter cutoff @xmath109 , chirality - protected shift @xmath120 , and lattice constance @xmath121 .",
    "because we are using the continuous low - energy model , we demand that @xmath122 . if we also demand that the final result does not depend on the wave - packet width , we require that @xmath123 . in practice , we only need @xmath124 to eliminate the wave - packet width @xmath45 dependence of the final result . therefore , in order to make our result solid , we need to combine the above conditions , i.e. , @xmath125 .",
    "( iii ) temperature influence : the real experiments are always done in finite temperature , and the temperature influence must be taken into account .",
    "however , the temperature only serves as the fluctuation of the fermi energy .",
    "when temperature is low enough , the final result will not change much .",
    "( iv ) large fermi energy in ref . [ 3 ] : we comment that our theory may not be applicable to ref . [ 3 ] , in which the authors report the observation of the ultrahigh mobility for large fermi energy ( 232 @xmath126 ) . in our model , the lifetime ratio @xmath8 is extremely large when fermi energy approaches to the weyl nodes , and can be strongly suppressed due to the increasing of the fermi energy.@xcite",
    "we found the chirality - protected shift in the wave - packet scattering process by using the angular momentum conservation method . the chirality - protected transverse shift modifies the effective impact parameters , and leads to the anomalous scattering probability .",
    "more importantly , we give a full quantum treatment of the wave - packet scattering process and derive the exact result of the wave - packet scattering probability .",
    "our results show that the ratio between the transport lifetime and the quantum lifetime increases sharply when the fermi energy approaches the weyl nodes .",
    "the unexpected large ratio can lead to the experimental findings of the puzzling ultrahigh mobility in topological semimetals .",
