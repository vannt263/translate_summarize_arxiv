    "grand unified theories ( guts ) are considered as one of the most appealing extensions of the standard model where one understands the origin of the gauge interactions . in the context of guts",
    "@xcite the standard model interactions are just different manifestations at low - energy of the same fundamental interaction .",
    "unfortunately , these theories are realized at very high energy scales , @xmath0 gev  @xcite , and one can not hope to test these ideas directly in experiments .",
    "supersymmetric unification  @xcite is very appealing and works very well in the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard model .",
    "however , the unification is also only possible at energy scales around @xmath1 gev or even at the string scale , see for example  @xcite .",
    "the most generic prediction coming from grand unification is proton decay  @xcite and in most of the gut models one needs an extra suppression mechanism to satisfy the experimental limits on the proton lifetime .",
    "this is the main reason to assume the large energy gap between the electroweak and gut scale which is known as the great desert .",
    "it is well - known that in the standard model baryon and lepton numbers are conserved symmetries at the classical level . in our modern view , the standard model is just an effective theory which describes physics at the electroweak scale . in general",
    ", one should think about the impact of all possible higher - dimensional operators which modify the standard model predictions .",
    "for example , in the standard model one can have the following higher order effective operators @xmath2 where the first operator violates lepton number , the second violates baryon number and the third breaks the flavour symmetry of the standard model gauge sector .",
    "the experimental bounds demand @xmath3 gev , @xmath4 gev @xcite , and @xmath5 tev  @xcite , when @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are of order one .",
    "since in any generic gut one generates the second operator due to new gauge interactions , it is impossible to achieve unification at the low scale without predicting an unstable proton and therefore one needs the great desert . if one could imagine a theoretical framework where the second operator is absent , the proton is stable and the unification scale is only constrained by flavor physics and has to be above @xmath9 tev .",
    "this is the main goal of this article .    in this article",
    ", we investigate the possibility to achieve unification at the low scale in the context of theories where baryon and lepton numbers are local symmetries spontaneously broken at the low scale . in these theories ,",
    "the proton is stable and the new fields needed to define an anomaly free theory allow for unification at the low scale .",
    "one can imagine different scenarios where the unification scale could be between @xmath10 tev and the planck scale .",
    "if the unification scale is smaller than @xmath10 tev , one needs an extra mechanism to suppress the flavor violating effective operators .",
    "following the recent results presented in refs .",
    "@xcite we find that the lepto - baryons needed to cancel the baryonic and leptonic anomalies allow us to have unification at the low scale .",
    "we discuss in detail the possible scenarios where the unification scale is around @xmath9 tev and point out the main features of the model .",
    "see fig .  1 for the unification of standard model gauge interactions at @xmath9 tev .",
    "see the text for details.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "in order to investigate the unification of gauge interactions at the low scale it is important to make sure that the proton is stable or the baryon number violating operators are highly suppressed .",
    "recently , the minimal theory  @xcite where the baryon and lepton numbers can be defined as local symmetries has been pointed out .",
    "this theory is based on the gauge group @xmath11 and the new fermions called  lepto - baryons \" needed for anomaly cancellation are @xmath12 where @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the number of copies . notice that these fields change only the evolution of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 gauge couplings .",
    "the higgs sector of this theory is composed of the fields @xmath17 and @xmath18 . therefore , when @xmath19 acquires a vacuum expectation value we will have @xmath20 processes . when @xmath21 is spontaneously broken and @xmath22 ( @xmath23 is an integer number ) the proton is stable because one only has @xmath24 interactions .",
    "the evolution of the standard model gauge couplings at one - loop level is described by the equation @xmath25 where @xmath26 are the normalization factors . in the simplest grand unified theory based on @xmath27 one",
    "has @xmath28 .",
    "however , in general the @xmath29 value depends of the embedding in a given theory .",
    "the coefficients @xmath30 contain all possible contributions from the low scale , @xmath31 , to the unification scale , @xmath32 .",
    "here , @xmath33 is the mass scale of the new fermions , @xmath34 is the step function , and @xmath35 are the coefficients in the standard model .    using the above equations one can solve for the unification scale as a function of the values of the gauge couplings at the @xmath31 scale and the mass of the new fields @xmath36 where @xmath37 in the same way , we can find the expression for the value of @xmath29 for given values of @xmath33 @xmath38 in the model discussed above , where baryon and lepton numbers are local symmetries , the new coefficients are @xmath39 .",
    "now , we are ready to understand the numerical results assuming the unification of gauge interactions . in table",
    "i we show different scenarios where @xmath14 takes the values from one to five , excluding @xmath40 .",
    "assuming for simplicity that the new fermions are at the same scale , @xmath41 gev , we compute the unification scale and the allowed values for the @xmath29 parameter . as one can see the unification scale can be as low as @xmath9 tev in agreement with the constraints from flavor violation . in all these scenarios",
    "the proton is stable .",
    ".solutions for the unification at the low scale in models with gauged baryon and lepton numbers . [ cols=\"<,^,<,^,<,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in fig .  1 we show the evolution of the gauge couplings in the standard model and in the model with lepto - baryons",
    ". the lepto - baryons at the low scale change the evolution of @xmath42 and @xmath43 dramatically without affecting @xmath44 .",
    "we assume four copies of lepto - baryons with baryon and lepton numbers equal to @xmath45 .",
    "since they have different baryon and lepton numbers than the standard model fields we never induce new sources of flavor violation and the unification scale @xmath32 is larger than @xmath9 tev in order to suppress the flavor violating effective operators discussed in the introduction .",
    "the lightest neutral field in the new sector is always stable after symmetry breaking as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and one has a candidate to describe the cold dark matter in the universe .",
    "the collider bounds on the new fermions are weak because they can only be produced through electroweak interactions at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "therefore , this type of model is in agreement with all constraints coming from collider experiments and cosmology .      in this minimal theory for local baryon and lepton numbers the evolution of the new couplings is defined by the equation @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",
    "the @xmath48 coefficients are given by @xmath49 and @xmath50 notice that the values of these gauge couplings at different scales and the @xmath51 are barely constrained .",
    "however , one can envision that it is possible to define a theory where all gauge couplings are unified , the standard model couplings , @xmath43 , @xmath42 , @xmath44 , and the new couplings @xmath52 and @xmath53.therefore , assuming unification at the @xmath32 scale , we can find the values of @xmath52 and @xmath53 at the @xmath31 scale for given values of @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the contribution of the standard model fields to the running of the baryonic and leptonic couplings is given by the coefficients @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the new fields contribute as follows @xmath58 notice that the right - handed neutrinos and @xmath19 contribute to the running of the leptonic coupling , defining the difference between the running of @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "we assume for simplicity @xmath59 for the running of the @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "at the @xmath31 scale we find @xmath60 and @xmath61.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    hence , we can calculate the values of these couplings assuming unification at the low scale . for simplicity",
    ", we have assumed the same @xmath62 factor for all abelian symmetries in the theory .    in fig .",
    "2 we show the numerical results for the running of all gauge couplings",
    ". as one can appreciate the couplings @xmath52 and @xmath53 are small at the electroweak scale .",
    "this result is welcome because in this way one can satisfy the bounds on the leptophobic @xmath63 and quarkphobic @xmath64 gauge couplings coming from collider experiments .",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite for the bounds on the leptophobic gauge bosons .",
    "now , let us explicitly write down the relevant interactions for the model in order to understand how the different fields can obtain mass after symmetry breaking .",
    "the relevant interactions are given by @xmath65 where @xmath66 are the right - handed neutrinos and @xmath67 is the standard model higgs boson . in general for @xmath14 copies of the fields the couplings @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 are @xmath75 matrices .",
    "notice that when @xmath76 breaks @xmath21 all the new fields can have large masses even before the electroweak symmetry is broken .",
    "the leptonic @xmath77 symmetry is broken by the vacuum expectation value of @xmath19 , and in the same way we generate large right - handed neutrino masses .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we have investigated the possible implications for baryogenesis if the local baryon number is broken at the low scale for @xmath78 . in this scenario",
    "the sphalerons must satisfy the extra condition that total baryon number is conserved .",
    "as one can see in ref .",
    "@xcite it is possible to have a consistent relation between the final baryon asymmetry and the @xmath79 asymmetry generated by some mechanisms in the early universe such as leptogenesis .",
    "these results can be easily generalized for several copies of the new fermions . in ref .",
    "@xcite we also discussed the existence of a dark matter candidate which is the lightest majorana fermion in the new sector .",
    "if we have several copies of these fields , the same candidate can be used to describe the cold dark matter in the universe .    before we summarize our main results , it is important to discuss the impact on the running of the gauge couplings in the context of other models where the cancellation of the baryonic and leptonic anomalies is possible . in ref .",
    "@xcite the anomaly cancellation was realized using an extra chiral family . unfortunately",
    ", this solution is ruled out by the lhc due to the existence of a standard model - like higgs . in ref .",
    "@xcite the possibility to use vector - like families for anomaly cancellation was pointed out .",
    "these vector - like families change the running of the gauge couplings , but the unification is always realized at high scales because the new quarks change the evolution of the strong coupling as well .    the possibility to cancel the b and l anomalies using lepto - baryons",
    "was also discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the new fields do not change the evolution of the strong coupling and they are singlets or live in the fundamental representation of @xmath80 . since the fundamental representation of @xmath80 contributes less than the adjoint representation one will need many copies of these fields to achieve the low scale unification .",
    "therefore , we focus on the scenarios studied in this article since they are the minimalistic setting where we can make sure that the proton is stable after symmetry breaking and the unification can be realized at the low scale as shown in fig .  1 and fig",
    "we have presented our results at one - loop level in order to illustrate the main idea .",
    "it is also important to understand the predictions at two - loop level and in a given unified theory the threshold effects could be very important .",
    "in this article , we have shown that the unification of the standard model gauge interactions can be achieved at the low scale . in order to investigate this issue we focused on theories where baryon and lepton numbers are defined as local gauge symmetries spontaneously broken at the low scale . in this class of theories ,",
    "the proton is stable and the unification of the gauge couplings can be realized at the low scale in a consistent way .",
    "we have illustrated the numerical results in fig .  1 and fig .  2 for the case @xmath81 , where the unification scale is @xmath82 tev , in agreement with the constraints from flavor violating decays .",
    "in our opinion , one can have an even lower unification scale adding more copies of the new fermions , but it is only reasonable if there is a mechanism to suppress flavor violation .",
    "we listed one example in table i where the unification is below @xmath9 tev in order to complete our studies .",
    "the low unification scale which can be achieved with lepto - baryons motivates the possibility to test the idea of grand unification at future colliders .",
    "one should say that these results are just one step towards the possibility to have a complete unified theory at the low scale .",
    "we have identified which type of theories allow us to realize low scale unification . in this context , using different copies of lepto - baryons needed for anomaly cancellation we find the allowed values for the @xmath62 coefficients for exact unification .",
    "these results should motivate the model builders in the gut and string communities since now one can search for alternative ways to have unification at the low scale . in our opinion , these results tell us that the dream of testing the unification of gauge interactions is maybe not too far .",
    "the main priority in this field is to find the simplest unified theory which could allow us to have the embedding of this low energy theory with gauged baryon and lepton numbers .",
