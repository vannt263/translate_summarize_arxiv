    "the motivation of this work is the large - degree analysis of the behavior of the jacobi polynomials @xmath5 , when the parameters @xmath6 , @xmath7 are complex and depend on the degree @xmath8 linearly .",
    "recall that these polynomials can be given explicitly by ( see @xcite ) @xmath9 or , equivalently , by the well - known rodrigues formula @xmath10 .\\ ] ] clearly , polynomials @xmath5 are entire functions of the complex parameters @xmath11 .",
    "if we fix @xmath12 and allow @xmath13 , the zeros of @xmath14 will cluster on @xmath15 $ ] and distribute there according to the well - known arcsine law .",
    "a non - trivial asymptotic behavior can be obtained in the case of varying coefficients @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "namely , we will consider sequences @xmath16 where both @xmath17 and @xmath18 are fixed .",
    "the case @xmath19 can be studied by the already standard techniques from the potential theory @xcite or by the saddle point method applied to their integral representation , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the general situation @xmath20 was analyzed in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are interested in the situation when at least one of the parameters , @xmath17 or @xmath18 , is non - real , see e.g.  figure  [ fig : onlyzeros ] .",
    "to be more precise , we assume that @xmath21 clearly , results for the case @xmath22 and @xmath23 can be easily deduced by reversing the roles of @xmath24 and @xmath25 .    fig1(29,31)@xmath26 ( 68,33)@xmath27    the key feature of the jacobi polynomials that we use in their asymptotic analysis is their orthogonality property .",
    "it is well known that when @xmath28 , the jacobi polynomials are orthogonal on @xmath15 $ ] with respect to the weight function @xmath29 .",
    "but as it was shown in @xcite , for general @xmath12 we can associate with @xmath14 a complex , non - hermitian orthogonality , where the integration goes along some contour in the complex plane .",
    "this is the key , at least in theory , to the study of the limit root location , as well as of the so - called weak ( or @xmath8-th root ) asymptotics of these polynomials ( via the gonchar - rakhmanov - stahl ( grs ) theory @xcite ) , and of their strong uniform asymptotics on the whole plane ( by means of the riemann - hilbert ( rh ) steepest descent method of deift - zhou @xcite ) .",
    "the grs method , in its general form , allows to reduce the description of the cluster set of the zeros of the sequence  to the problem of finding in a given homotopic class of curves the one with the so - called @xmath4-property in the associated external field @xmath30 ( see the definition in section  [ section : equilibrium ] ) , which in our case is @xmath31    the most general known existence theorem for the @xmath4-curves is contained in @xcite under the assumption that external field is harmonic in a complement to a finite set ( see also @xcite for the polynomial external fields ) .",
    "this is the case of @xmath30 in for @xmath20 , see @xcite for the analysis of the weak asymptotics ( via the grs theory ) and @xcite for the strong uniform asymptotics on @xmath3 ( by the rh technique ) .",
    "however , @xmath30 is not harmonic ( it is not even single valued ) in @xmath3 if we assume , which adds a new essential feature to the problem . in this case ,",
    "the explicit construction of the curve with the @xmath4-property is a consequence of the analysis of the structure of trajectories of the following quadratic differential on the riemann sphere @xmath32 : @xmath33 where @xmath34 although the local structure of such trajectories is well known , the global topology of the so - called critical graph is usually much more difficult to analyze .",
    "thus , one of the central results of this paper is this description , carried out in section  [ section_trajectories ] , theorem [ thm:1 ] . as a result",
    ", we claim that for every pair of parameters @xmath35 satisfying there exists an analytic jordan arc @xmath36 , homotopic in the punctured plane @xmath37 to a jordan arc connecting both zeros of the polynomial @xmath38 in @xmath39 $ ] , and given by the equation @xmath40 this curve is the limiting set for the zeros of the jacobi polynomials .",
    "namely , with each @xmath41 we associate its normalized zero - counting measure @xmath42 , such that for any compact set @xmath43 in @xmath3 , @xmath44 here the zeros are counted with their multiplicities .    in section  [ section : jacobi ]",
    "we show that the sequence @xmath45 converges ( as @xmath13 ) in the weak- * topology to a measure @xmath46 , supported on @xmath47 , absolutely continuous with respect to the linear lebesgue measure on @xmath47 , and given by the formula @xmath48 see theorem  [ teojac1 ] . in section  [ section : equilibrium ]",
    "we establish that this is the equilibrium measure on @xmath47 in an external field , characterized by the above - mentioned @xmath4-property .",
    "it is worth noticing that the fact @xmath49 has an alternative interpretation from the point of view of the hypergeometric differential equation corresponding to @xmath14 : for each @xmath50 , @xmath45 is a discrete critical measures in the external field @xmath30 , and @xmath46 is the continuous critical measure in the same field . a general convergence theorem of this kind was proved in @xcite .",
    "however , the reduction of the case analyzed here to the results of @xcite is not direct . in particular ,",
    "the existence and uniqueness of continuous critical measures for external fields with complex parameters is in general an open problem .",
    "our final remark is that using the construction of the measure @xmath46 and the steepest descent method for the riemann ",
    "hilbert characterization of the jacobi polynomials @xcite the strong asymptotic formula can be proved .",
    "for instance ( see below ) , @xmath51 where we take the holomorphic branch of the square root in @xmath52 such that @xmath53 then function @xmath54 is holomorphic in the same domain .",

    "constants @xmath57 are chosen to match the leading term of @xmath41 .",
    "this result ( as well as its analogues on the limiting curve @xmath47 and at @xmath55 ) is established following almost literally the arguments of @xcite , and we refer the interested reader to that paper for details .",

    "let us return to the jacobi polynomials considered in section [ sec : intro ] , and consider the case of varying coefficients @xmath6 and @xmath7 and study the asymptotic behavior of the zeros of the sequences of polynomials @xmath41 given in , where the constants @xmath17 and @xmath18 satisfy the assumptions . as it was mentioned , it is sufficient to restrict our attention to the case .",
    "our main goal now is to study the convergence of the sequence @xmath45 of the zero counting measures in the weak-@xmath243 topology and , if the limit exists , to find it explicitly .    the main result of this section is the following theorem :    [ teojac1 ] let the sequence of generalized jacobi polynomials @xmath41 in ( [ eq_p ] ) be such that the pair @xmath72 satisfies assumptions .",
    "then there is a unique measure @xmath46 such that @xmath244 the measure @xmath46 is supported on the short trajectory @xmath47 , is absolutely continuous with respect to the linear lebesgue measure on @xmath47 , and is given by the formula .",

    "it is straightforward to obtain the following result , proved in @xcite :    [ proport ] under assumptions , let @xmath209 be a jordan curve joining @xmath210 and @xmath211 , and lying entirely ( except for its endpoints ) in @xmath212 $ ] .",
    "then , for all sufficiently large @xmath50 , @xmath245 here the integral is understood in terms of the analytic continuation of any branch of the integrand along @xmath209 .",
    "the main tools for the study of the weak asymptotic behavior of polynomials satisfying a non - hermitian orthogonality have been developed in the seminal works of stahl @xcite and gonchar and rakhmanov @xcite .",
    "they showed that when the complex analytic weight function depends on the degree of the polynomial , the limit zero distribution is characterized by an equilibrium problem on a compact set in the presence of an external field and satisfying the @xmath4-property described in section  [ section : equilibrium ] .",
    "in fact , theorem  [ teojac1 ] is a direct consequence of proposition  [ proport ] , the properties of @xmath46 established in section  [ section : equilibrium ] , and the original work @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .    finally , as it was mentioned in the introduction , measure @xmath46 and the structure of the trajectories of @xmath59 are also the main ingredients of the steepest descent method for the riemann ",
