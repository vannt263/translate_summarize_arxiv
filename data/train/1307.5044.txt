    "in a general cosmological set up , the accretion of a satellite , initially on hubble flow , into a galaxy occurs when it decelerates under the gravitational attraction of its host , reaches a zero velocity surface , turns around and falls back into the host potential . as the parameter space for our problem is unmanageably large , we focus the initial conditions for our simulations around these cosmologically most - plausible configurations . in our model ,",
    "the satellite starts its infall onto m31 from its first turnaround radius .",
    "an estimate of the turnaround radius of the satellite can be made as follows .",
    "the turnaround radius grows , roughly , as @xmath5 which is given by a simple secondary infall model @xcite for a highly radial and smooth accretion .",
    "it has been shown that the secondary infall model represents quite well the numerical simulations in which dark matter haloes grow by clumpy accretion of satellites @xcite .",
    "it is hard to estimate the present turnaround radius of m31 , as milky way and m31 are thought to have a common halo .",
    "however , most observations put the present turnaround radius of m31 at around 1 mpc . hence using the above expression , we see that a few gyrs ago , the turnaround radius of m31 was about a few hundreds of kpcs .",
    "we run around 40 full n - body simulations to fine - tune in this part of the parameter space . in our best - fit model ,",
    "the satellite starts at its first turnaround radius at about 200 kpcs with a null velocity and along the direction    lcl x_0 = -84.41 , + y_0 = 152.47 , + z_0 = -97.08 , + [ eq : orbit_infall ]    where the coordinates are given in kpc and in a reference frame centered on m31 with the @xmath6 axis pointing east , the @xmath7 pointing north and the @xmath8 axis correspond to the line - of - sight direction .",
    "these initial conditions have been found by sampling the parameter space in the region corresponding to the direction of the gss observations , which is remarkably the same plane that is inhabited by the majority of the satellites of m31 @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : thinplane - mw ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : thinplane - m31 ] .",
    "a satellite on such an orbit would have a very large velocity at the pericentre passage and would not be able to account for the large mass of the gss , as it would loose too little mass .",
    "however , it could slow down by dynamical friction , which can be significant if the satellite is dark - matter - rich .",
    "therefore , we consider a dark - matter - dominated satellite which is also consistent with the observation of most local group dwarfs ( see _ e.g. _",
    "we assume that the stellar mass of the satellite is still the same as we used for the empirical models , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath9 , studied in section [ sec : empirical ] .",
    "this assumption is reasonable as the stellar mass of the satellite is relatively well - constrained by the stellar mass of the gss @xcite . in our best fit initial conditions , the ratio of total to stellar mass is @xmath10 and the halo has a mass of @xmath11 .      in order to assess the ability of our model to reproduce the gss observations",

    "we trace the orbit of the satellite by following the initially most - bound particles in our simulation .",
    "the resulting trajectory is represented as a dashed line in the real space projection and shows that the merger is almost a head - on collision between m31 and the satellite .",
    "we are also able to identify the tidal structures in phase - space and find again the presence of an extended stream and two caustics formed by coherent group of particles with same number of pericentric passages .",
    "the stellar density maps in sky coordinates compared to the position of the observed fields of the gss and the edges of the two shelves is shown in fig .",

    "we obtain a good agreement between our simulated stream and the gss in the case of the spherical plummer model . on the other hand ,",
    "the disk model is unable to reproduce correctly the angular direction of the stream .",

    "<S> a different and somehow far - fetched argument in favour of such a model is to assume that the satellite actually formed at a distance of around 40 kpc from m31 a few hundreds of megayears ago . </S>",
    "<S> however , this is rather unlikely in a @xmath0cdm hierarchical model in which satellite galaxies are in general older and form earlier than their parent galaxies and also it would be difficult to explain the stellar population of the giant stellar stream in such a model .    in the next section , </S>",
    "<S> we propose a new set of initial conditions that are cosmologically - motivated and overcome the difficulties encountered in the empirical models for the formation of gss and show that indeed such reasonably - conceived models do satisfy a full range of observational constraints . </S>"
