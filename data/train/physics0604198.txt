    "recent years have seen a remarkable progress in the technology of producing supermirrors , both in terms of the critical angle and the reflectivity , which resulted in substantial increase in neutron flux at various neutron beam facilities .",
    "however , for transporting neutrons over long distances ( @xmath1  m ) , the finite reflectivity for angles above @xmath2 ( the critical angle for natural nickel ) causes a significant loss in the neutron flux exiting the guide .",
    "( the reflectivity of a good @xmath0 guide is 80% at @xmath0 ) .",
    "the so - called `` ballistic guide '' geometry , first proposed by mezei  @xcite , allows neutrons to be transported over long distances without significant losses .",
    "the first ballistic guide using supermirror was installed as the h113 beamline at ill  @xcite .",
    "this guide was 72  m long .",
    "it diverged linearly in width from 6  cm to 9  cm over the first 10  m. the width stayed at 9  cm over the next 44  m , and then converged back linearly to 6  cm .",
    "it showed an excellent performance providing a factor four increase in neutron fluence over the @xmath3ni coated straight guide installed before . in ref .",
    "@xcite , an optimization of a 46.8  m long ballistic guide geometry is presented and the results are compared to the existing straight guide 1rnr14 at sinq at psi . in this study , parabolic and elliptic tapering in both horizontal and vertical directions was considered for the diverging and converging horns as well as straight ( = linear ) tapering .",
    "it was found that for their input neutron distribution , a guide geometry with elliptically tapered sections performs better than a ballistic guide geometry with straight taper , giving a factor 5 higher neutron flux compared to that of the existing @xmath4 straight guide .",
    "we have performed a careful optimization of the ballistic guide design for the sns fnpb 8.9   neutron beam line using a custom made monte carlo simulation program .",
    "we carefully optimized various aspects of the ballistic guide geometry .",
    "in particular , we adopted a new parameterization of the shape of the tapered section , which allowed us to optimize the shape of the tapered section in an efficient manner . with a careful tuning of the shape of the tapered section and the width of the straight section ,",
    "this optimization resulted in more than a 75% increase in the neutron flux exiting the 33  m long guide over that of a straight @xmath0 guide with the same length . in this paper",
    ", we describe the optimization process and present the obtained results .",
    "one important point that needs to be emphasized is that the optimum choice for various aspects of the ballistic guide geometry , such as the shape of the tapered section and the widths of the straight section , strongly depends on the angular and positional distribution of the neutron flux entering the ballistic guide .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : general_consideration ] , the principle of the ballistic guide and some important design considerations are reviewed .",
    "then in section  [ section : optimization ] , after a brief description of the sns fnpb beamline and its characteristics , the optimization process including the monte carlo program is described in detail , and the results are presented .",
    "the term `` ballistic guide '' refers to an arrangement in which a diverging horn is followed by a wide ( and usually long ) straight section , and then by a converging horn ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ballistic_schematic ] ) .",
    "with such an arrangement , the divergence ( angular spread ) of the incident neutron distribution is turned to a spatial spread by the diverging horn , which results in a reduced loss during the propagation through the straight section because of the smaller angles ( i.e. higher reflectivity ) and fewer bounces ( due to the smaller angles and the larger guide width ) .",
    ", width=377 ]    liouville s theorem states that the following inequality holds for the phase space occupied by an ensemble of neutrons traveling through a ballistic guide : @xmath5 and where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the angular and spatial spreads of the initial distribution of the neutrons entering the diverging horn of the ballistic guide , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are those for the neutrons in the straight section right after the diverging horn .",
    "a similar inequality holds for the neutrons in the straight section right before the converging horn and the neutrons exiting the converging horn .",
    "note , however , in general in both the diverging and converging horns , there is an unavoidable loss of neutron flux due to the fact that the reflectivity is less than unity for angles larger than @xmath2 .",
    "in fact , as we will see later , the loss in the diverging horn is a major source of loss in ballistic guide geometry .",
    "the task of optimizing the design is to perform this `` phase space rotation '' ( from large @xmath6 and small @xmath7 to small @xmath8 and large @xmath9 ) in the diverging horn as efficiently as possible , i.e. as closely to the equality limit as possible , while minimizing the loss ( due to the finite reflectivity ) in the diverging horn itself .",
    "an inefficient phase space rotation would result in a larger than necessary guide width for the straight section , which would not only be more expensive to build but would also cause a larger loss in the converging horn .",
    "also , the shape of the converging horn has to be optimized to minimize additional losses during the second phase space rotation .",
    "the converging horn does not exactly reverse the effect of the diverging horn on the neutron phase space .",
    "rather , a loss of neutrons also occurs in the converging horn , due to the nonlinear nature of ballistic transport .",
    "the loss in the converging horn is another major contributor to the loss in the ballistic guide .",
    "this point is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : neutron_tracks ] , where the solid and dashed lines represent the trajectories of two neutrons that had slightly different initial conditions ( the neutrons travel from left to right ) . despite the small difference in the initial conditions , one ( solid line )",
    "makes it to the end whereas the other ( dashed line ) does not ( these trajectories were calculated by the simulation program described in this document ) .",
    "the neutron represented by the dashed trajectory gets lost when it makes the second interaction with the wall of the converging horn , where the angle was too large for the neutron to be reflected ( the first interaction in the converging horn has the same angle as that in the diverging horn ) .",
    "it can also be seen that the neutron with the dashed trajectory too would make it to the end without making the second interaction with the wall in the converging horn , if the straight section were a little shorter or the neutron started at a slightly different location .",
    ", width=480 ]    for a typical supermirror , the reflectivity is virtually unity for angles less than @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , @xmath8 does not have to be infinitesimally small .",
    "it should rather be around @xmath2",
    ". otherwise @xmath9 would be unnecessarily large , which would cause a larger loss in the converging horn .",
    "this argument provides a good estimate for the optimum guide width of the straight section . in general ,",
    "if the input neutron distribution has an angular spread that extends to @xmath10 , then , the optimum guide width is expected to be in the neighborhood of @xmath11 times the width of the entrance of the diverging horn ( or perhaps slightly narrower , because the narrower the guide is in the straight section , the smaller the loss is in the converging horn ) .",
    "the simplest realization of a ballistic guide uses a straight taper for the diverging and converging horns .",
    "however , a more efficient phase space rotation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : phase_space_rot ] ) can be achieved by using a curved taper as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : curved1 ] .",
    "this figure  [ fig : curved1 ] illustrates how the use of a curved taper for the diverging horn can result in a smaller loss in the horn and in a more favorable neutron angular distribution in the straight section .",
    "the solid arrow represents a trajectory of a neutron with a large angle .",
    "it would hit the wall of the horn at a larger angle at point a for the straight taper than it would at point a for the curved taper .",
    "since the reflectivity is larger for smaller angles of incident ( when the angle is larger than @xmath2 ) , the curved taper causes a smaller loss for large angle neutrons than the straight taper .",
    "the dashed arrow represents a trajectory of a neutron with a small angle . in this case",
    ", the neutron would hit the wall at a larger angle for the curved taper than it would for the straight taper .",
    "however , in this case , the angle is already small ( smaller than @xmath2 ) so hitting the wall at a larger angle does not lead to a loss . instead , the final angle resulting from the bounce is closer to being parallel to the @xmath12 axis for the curved taper , which results in a reduced loss in the converging horn .",
    "( note if all the neutrons have a trajectory parallel to the @xmath12 axis , the loss in the converging horn is substantially reduced . )    , width=384 ]    we therefore considered using a curved taper for the diverging and converging horns in this study . as is obvious from the discussion in the previous paragraph",
    ", the shape of the curved taper has to be optimized for the given neutron distribution . to conveniently parameterize the shape of the curve , we used the following expression for the shape of curved tapers : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the half width of the entrance and exit of the horn and @xmath16 is the length of the horn , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : curved2 ] .",
    "the neutron beam travels in the positive @xmath12 direction in this figure , and @xmath17 is perpendicular to @xmath12 . note that the first two terms if eq .",
    "( [ eq : curve ] ) give the straight line that connects the two points determined by the entrance and exit widths and the length of the horn .",
    "the third term is a quadratic in @xmath12 , fixed at the endpoints , which represents the first order deviation from the straight line .",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath18 determines the size of this term : @xmath19 corresponds to the straight line , and @xmath20 corresponds to matching the derivative at the end of the horn with the straight section .",
    "it gives a curve that deviates from the straight line by @xmath21 at @xmath22 ( note that both the factor @xmath12 and @xmath23 are divided by @xmath16 so that @xmath18 is dimensionless ) .",
    "there is no point in using a parabola , since the source is not point - like .",
    "the advantage of using this parameterization , instead of using parabola , hyperbola , or ellipsoid , is that it is linear in the limit of @xmath19 instead of in the asymptotic limit of some parameter @xmath24 .",
    "no matter which shape we use  parabola , hyperbola , or ellipsoid  the actual deviation from the straight line will be small because the horn is several meters long whereas it is only a few tens of centimeters wide .",
    "therefore our parameterization should capture the essence of the curved guide .",
    "in other words , we do not expect the results to be too dependent of the details of the shape , which was confirmed for our particular neutron distribution by adding terms in higher order in @xmath12 and seeing no significant gain in performance ( see section  [ sec : fulloptimization ] ) .",

    "the spallation neutron source ( sns ) , currently under construction at the oak ridge national laboratory , is an accelerator - based neutron source , and will provide the world s most intense pulsed neutron beams for scientific research and industrial development  @xcite .",
    "the fundamental neutron physics beamline ( fnpb ) , one of the 24 neutron beamlines in the sns target hall , is dedicated to fundamental physics using cold and ultracold neutrons .",
    "figure  [ fig : fnpb ] shows the schematic of the layout of the fnpb beamline .",
    ", width=453 ]    the fnpb has two neutron beamlines , the `` cold neutron line '' and the 8.9  line ( or `` ucn line '' ) .",
    "the 8.9  line is dedicated to experiments that will uses the superthermal process in superfluid liquid helium to produce ultra - cold neutrons .",
    "the 8.9  neutrons will be selected by a double crystal monochromator and will be sent to an external building located about 30  m downstream .",
    "a calculation  @xcite shows that a neutron fluence of @xmath25  n / s /   can be obtained when a straight @xmath0 guide with a cross section of 12  cm  @xmath26  14  cm and a length of 33  m is used to transport the 8.9  neutrons from the monochromator to the external building .",
    "the goal of this study is to find the optimum geometry for a ballistic guide which transports the 8.9  neutrons from the monochromator to the external building .      as mentioned in section  [ sec : general_consideration ] , the optimum choice for various aspect of the ballistic guide geometry , such as the shape of the tapered section and the widths of the straight section , strongly depends on the angular and position distribution of the neutron flux entering the ballistic guide .",
    "it is therefore important to examine the characteristics of the incident neutron distribution in order to intelligently optimize the design of the ballistic guide .",
    "figures  [ fig : pos_in ] and [ fig : ang_in ] show the position and angular distribution in the horizontal ( @xmath17 ) and vertical ( @xmath27 ) directions of the neutrons coming out of the double crystal monochromator .",
    "these distributions were obtained from a monte carlo program written by p.  huffman based on mcstas  @xcite , which generates neutrons according to the neutron input source files for the sns target and tracks neutrons through the fnpb beamline elements including the double crystal monochromator that extracts the 8.9   neutrons  @xcite .",
    ", width=480 ]    .[fig : ang_in],width=480 ]    the position distributions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pos_in ] confirm that the choice of the cross section of 12  cm  @xmath26  14  cm for the entrance of the ballistic guide is reasonable .",
    "for the angular distributions , from fig .",
    "[ fig : ang_in ] we notice that the horizontal angular spread is only @xmath28 whereas the vertical angular spread is as large as @xmath29 .",
    "this is because of the mosaic structure of the crystals that are used in the double crystal monochromator , and also because of how the two crystals are arranged in the double crystal monochromator .",
    "the angular spread caused by the randomly oriented small `` blocks '' in the mosaic of one crystal cancels that of the other crystal to the first order in the horizontal direction but not in the vertical direction when the two crystals are arranged horizontally .",
    "the narrow horizontal angular distribution also indicates that the neutron guide upstream of the double crystal monochromator is long enough for the neutrons with large angles be be lost while they travel from the sns target to the monochromator .",
    "the implication of these two angular distributions to the design of the ballistic guide is as follows ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ballistic_schematic2 ] for the notation ) :    * for the horizontal direction , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : phase_space_rot ] ) and the succeeding argument , the optimum width of the straight section is expected to be @xmath30  cm . * also , since the angular spread is relatively small in the horizontal direction , it is expected that the supermirror coating can have a smaller value for @xmath31 on the side walls of the diverging horn . * on the other hand , in the vertical direction , because of the large angular spread , the width of the straight section should ideally be @xmath32  cm .",
    "however , it is mechanically limited to @xmath33  cm .    as discussed in section  [ sec : simulation ] , we varied @xmath34 between 15  cm and 30  cm in search of the optimum ballistic guide design .",
    "we note that the angular spread could be reduced by using graphite crystals with a smaller mosaic angle  @xcite .",
    "the optimization of the ballistic guide was performed using a monte carlo simulation .",
    "a new neutron ray tracing package , dubbed neutrack 8.9 , was written to perform a series of transmission calculations to optimize the ballistic guide for the 8.9 line .",
    "while there was already an mcstas program to simulate the whole fnpb beamline system , we decided that it was advantageous to develop a new ray tracing package and write a whole new program using it to design the 8.9   line for several reasons , including the following :    * the mcstas fnpb simulation tracks neutrons all the way from the sns target down to the end of the beam line for all wavelengths .",
    "the fraction of the neutrons that get selected by the monochromator and get sent to the 8.9   line is very small .",
    "however , optimizing the ballistic guide design only involve simulating neutrons downstream of the monochromator .",
    "the simulation can be done more efficiently if the program simulates only the components downstream of the monochromator , generating only 8.9  neutrons at the entrance to the ballistic guide . * information important in designing a ballistic guide  such as ,",
    "where exactly in the system neutrons are lost and what the distribution is like for the angle at which the neutrons interact with each segment of supermirror  is not easily accessible by the user in mcstas .",
    "neutrack 8.9 is designed to simulate only a single wavelength of neutrons .",
    "the user has a complete access to information such as where exactly in the system neutrons are lost and what the distribution is like for the angle at which the neutrons interact with each segment of supermirror .",
    "a monte carlo simulation program using neutrack 8.9 was written to simulate a ballistic guide for the 8.9   line .",
    "neutrons were generated so that their distribution reproduces that of the neutrons coming out of the double crystal monochromator calculated by the mcstas fnpb simulation .",
    "the neutrons were then introduced into the ballistic guide , and the behavior of the neutrons in the guide was simulated .",
    "the performance of various geometries was evaluated using the transmission ( txmit )  the ratio of the number of neutrons exiting the guide to the number of neutrons entering the guide  and the relative transmission ( rel .",
    "txmit )  the ratio of the transmission of the guide geometry under consideration to that of the 12  cm @xmath26 14  cm straight guide .",
    "( note that since the input to the ballistic guide is the same for all different geometries , the relative transmission is the same as the output neutron flux or fluence normalized to that of the straight guide . )    various parameters including properties of the supermirrors were adjusted so that the results of this 8.9   line simulation program agreed with those from the mcstas fnpb simulation program for the same ballistic guide geometry .",
    "it was confirmed for several selected geometries that the results for the relative transmission from both simulation programs for the same geometry agreed within the statistical error of the simulation ( @xmath35% ) as shown in table  [ tab : comparison ] .",
