    "we consider a discrete - time approximation for the price of european call option in the model of financial market with stochastic volatility driven by the ornstein  uhlenbeck process .",
    "an analytic expression for the price of the option is derived in @xcite ; however , the resulting formula is complicated and difficult to apply in most of available software .",
    "the discrete - time approximation is ready to be modeled even in the nonspecific software .",
    "the problem of construction of discrete - time analogues for stochastic volatility models of financial markets is studied in a series of works including @xcite .",
    "various techniques are implemented , for example , multilevel monte carlo @xcite , conditional monte carlo @xcite , exact simulation @xcite , and it  taylor approximations @xcite .    in most of the works ,",
    "authors construct discrete - time approximations both for processes that describe the evolution of the price of asset and for processes driving the volatility of asset price . the model considered in this paper",
    "allows us to apply another approach : we only discretize the volatility process .",
    "the resulting discrete - time volatility process is then averaged in a special way and substituted into the option pricing formula .",
    "the option price is determined conditionally on the path of volatility process , and thus the conditional monte carlo approach is used .",
    "the rate of convergence of the option price calculated using the discrete - time volatility to the true option price for a given trajectory of volatility process is estimated .",
    "discretization of the model is naturally connected with the problem of discrete - time approximations to the solutions of stochastic differential equations .",
    "these matters are widely investigated and systematized in @xcite .",
    "the simplest discrete - time approximation is the stochastic generalization of euler approximation for deterministic differential equations proposed in @xcite , which is also referred to as the euler ",
    "maruyama scheme .",
    "another suitable for implementation and effective method is the milstein scheme @xcite .",
    "since the model under consideration is a diffusion with additive noise , both schemes coincide which is referred to below .",
    "it is worth noticing that euler and milstein schemes both belong to the class of it  taylor approximations and have orders of convergence 0.5 and 1 , respectively .",
    "for some diffusions , the approximation schemes can be enhanced to provide higher - order convergence , but this usually results in great increase in computation time .",
    "although exact simulation provides more precision compared to the euler approximation , in this paper , we use the latter .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that the euler approximation is cheaper in terms of computation time and by our desire to assess the rate of convergence of conditional option prices when the volatility is discretized using the euler scheme .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "we begin with the definition of the model under consideration and the discretization scheme used . in section  [ sec3 ] , the prices of the european call option",
    "are compared for discrete - time and continuous volatility processes to derive the estimate of strong convergence order .",
    "section  [ sec4 ] provides numeric results of the simulation . in section  [ sec5 ] ,",
    "we demonstrate the precision of discrete - time approximation for the case of deterministic volatility .",
    "appendix a contains definitions and auxiliary results on discretization schemes and orders of their convergence mostly coming from @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 be a complete probability space with filtration generated by wiener processes @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 .",
    "we consider the model of the market where one risky asset is traded , its price evolves according to the geometric brownian motion @xmath4 and its volatility is driven by a stochastic process .",
    "more precisely , the market is described by the pair of stochastic differential equations    @xmath5",
    "@xmath6    we denote by @xmath7 and @xmath8 the deterministic initial values of the processes specified by eqs .  .",
    "we further impose the following assumptions :    * the wiener processes @xmath9 and @xmath10 are uncorrelated ; * the volatility function @xmath11 is measurable , bounded away from zero by a constant @xmath12 : @xmath13 and satisfies the condition @xmath14 a.s . ; * the coefficients @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 are positive .",
    "for example , the conditions mentioned in assumption ( c2 ) are satisfied for the measurable function @xmath18 such that @xmath19 for @xmath20 and some constants @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , given the square integrability of @xmath22 , the solution of differential equation is given by @xmath23 which yields that @xmath24 is continuous .",
    "hence , the product @xmath25 is square integrable : @xmath26 a.s .",
    "the unique solution of the langevin equation @xmath27 is the so called ornstein  uhlenbeck ( ou ) process .",
    "its properties make it a suitable tool for modeling volatility in financial markets .",
    "one of the most important of the features is the mean - reversion property .",
    "the ou process is gaussian with the following characteristics : @xmath28=y_0\\operatorname{e}^{-\\alpha t } , \\qquad \\operatorname{var}[y_t]=\\frac{k^2}{2\\alpha } \\bigl(1-\\operatorname { e}^{-2\\alpha t } \\bigr).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    moreover , the ou process is markov and admits the explicit representation    @xmath29    following @xcite , we proceed to the risk - neutral setting characterized by the minimal martingale measure @xmath30 . with @xmath31 being the interest rate , eqs .",
    " are now in the following form ( see section 5 in @xcite ) : @xmath32 where @xmath33 are independent wiener processes w.r.t .",
    "@xmath30 .",
    "this continuous - time model admits a variety of discrete - time approximations . in this paper",
    ", we apply the familiar euler ",
    "maruyama scheme , also referred to as the euler scheme .",
    "the euler  maruyama approximation to the true solution of the langevin equation is the markov chain @xmath34 defined as follows :    * the partition of the interval @xmath35 $ ] into @xmath36 equal subintervals of width @xmath37 is considered ; * the initial value of the scheme is set : @xmath38 ; * @xmath39 , which we will use as a shorthand for @xmath40 , @xmath41 , is recursively defined by @xmath42 where @xmath43 .    the continuous - time process @xmath44 is a step - type process defined by @xmath45t / m } , \\quad t \\in[0,t],\\ ] ] where @xmath46 $ ] denotes an integer part of @xmath47 .",
    "the price of european call option @xmath48 in the initial time moment of in model   is provided by @xmath49    the inner expectation is conditional on the path of @xmath50 , and therefore , it actually is the black ",
    "scholes price for a model with deterministic time - dependent volatility . according to lemma 2.1 in @xcite , the inner expectation in has the following representation : @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 is the standard normal distribution function .",
    "the function @xmath54 may be viewed as the volatility averaged from the initial moment of time to maturity .",
    "the arguments of @xmath53 in are denoted as @xmath55 and  @xmath56 .",
    "our aim is to estimate the error arising as a result of approximation of the exact formula by application of the euler approximation to the process that drives volatility .",
    "thus , we need to assess the expectation of @xmath57 given by @xmath58 where  @xmath36 is the number of discretization points dividing the time interval @xmath35 $ ] into equal intervals , @xmath59 denotes the price of the option in discrete setting calculated using the formula similar to : @xmath60 where @xmath61 with@xmath62 where @xmath63 is defined in .",
    "it is unlikely that we are able to find an exact or even approximate value for  @xmath57 .",
    "however , what really makes interest for investigation of the above bundle of models is the rate of convergence of the discrete setting to the continuous one . in order to assess the rate of convergence , the expression for an upper bound of @xmath57 in terms of @xmath36 needs to be derived .    comparing and",
    ", we can see that the approximation error arises solely due to the difference between @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "so , the first step would assessing the upper bound of expectation of absolute value of this difference w.r.t .",
    "after that , @xmath57 might be expressed in terms of @xmath66 .",
    "[ lemsigma ] let @xmath67 satisfy the hlder condition @xmath68 where @xmath69 , and @xmath70 is some positive constant .",
    "then @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is some positive constant .",
    "since @xmath65 and @xmath54 are both square root functions , it is be more convenient to work with @xmath73 and @xmath74 . to this end , we will use hlder s inequality : @xmath75 now we represent the integral as a sum of integrals over shorter intervals . since the second summand does not depend on @xmath76 , we may move it inside the integral sign , multiplying it by the inverse to the interval length : @xmath77 we apply the hlder property of @xmath67 : @xmath78 recall that @xmath79 is a shorthand for @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and proposition from the appendix a yields that @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is some positive constant .",
    "we use hlder s inequality to derive that @xmath84 and arrive at @xmath85 for @xmath86 , which proves the lemma .",
    "the above lemma enables us to prove the main result of this section .",
    "let @xmath67 satisfy hlder condition .",
    "then @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is some positive constant .",
    "the function @xmath89 has a continuous bounded derivative on @xmath90 ; hence , we can use its lipschitz property : @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the density of the standard normal distribution . in the above representation , @xmath93 where @xmath12 is a positive constant , and",
    "the last inequality is due to the assumption that @xmath18 is bounded away from zero for any @xmath94 ( see assumption ( c2 ) ) .",
    "hence , using lemma  [ lemsigma ] , we get @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are positive constants",
    ".    similarly , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and we arrive at @xmath100 for a positive constant @xmath88 .",
    "the theorem is proved .",
    "theorem 6.1 in @xcite provides an analytic representation for the price of european call option for the stochastic volatility model under consideration .",
    "however , using it to calculate the price of an option is rather difficult and time - consuming .",
    "we further present the results of calculation of the price of european call option using simulation techniques .",
    "the calculation process is performed in matlab 7.9.0 and is structured as follows :    * the choice of discrete ranges of values of input parameters ; * the choice of the function @xmath22 ; * for each combination of input we generate 1000 trajectories of an ornstein  uhlenbeck process by splitting the time interval into subintervals of length @xmath101 and modeling values of the ou process at these points ( that is , generating normally distributed variables with known mean and standard deviation using relationship ) . for each trajectory , is applied to calculate @xmath73 and the price of an option .",
    "the results for all trajectories are then averaged and discounted to provide the sample average of the price denoted by @xmath102 .",
