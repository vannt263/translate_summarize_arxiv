    "the transition temperature and the equation of state ( eos ) of qcd at finite temperature belong to the most basic information for understanding the early universe and heavy ion collisions .",
    "full qcd studies of these quantities have been made mainly with the kogut - susskind quarks , particularly for the eos @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present the first result of the eos from wilson - type quarks .",
    "we study two - flavor qcd on @xmath0 lattices . in order to suppress lattice artifacts , which are known to be severe for the combination of the plaquette gauge and wilson quark actions ,",
    "we adopt a renormalization - group ( rg ) improved gauge action @xcite combined with a meanfield - improved clover quark action .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for details of our action .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] we show the phase diagram with our action at @xmath1 .",
    "the line of finite - temperature transition is determined by the polyakov loop and its susceptibility .",
    "the parity - broken phase @xcite is not yet identified .",
    "dashed lines are used in a test discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : eos ] .",
    "we compute the pressure @xmath2 by the integral method @xcite , which is based on the formula , valid for large homogeneous systems , that @xmath3 the integration path in the parameter space @xmath4 should start from a point in the low temperature phase where the integrand approximately vanishes .",
    "we evaluate the quark contributions to the derivatives @xmath5 and @xmath6 by the method of noisy source using u(1 ) noise vectors .    the value for the pressure computed in ( [ eq : integral ] )",
    "should be independent of the choice of the integration path . to check this point",
    ", we make a series of test runs on @xmath7 and @xmath8 lattices along three paths shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] , generating 500 hmc trajectories at each point .",
    "the results for @xmath9 obtained from these paths are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : prs84 ] .",
    "we find that @xmath9 at @xmath10 and @xmath11 in the two figures are in good agreement , confirming the path independence of the integral .    encouraged by this result , we perform production runs on @xmath12 and @xmath13 lattices . at each dots plotted in fig .  [",
    "fig : phase ] , we generate 5002000 trajectories on the @xmath12 lattice and 200300 trajectories on the @xmath14 lattice",
    ". measurement of the derivatives is made at every trajectory .",
    "hadron propagators are calculated at every fifth trajectory to compute pseudo scalar ( @xmath15 ) and vector ( @xmath16 ) meson masses .    as is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : prs84 ] , paths along the @xmath17-direction give much smaller errors in @xmath9 than those from paths in the @xmath18-direction .",
    "therefore , we carry out the integral in the @xmath17-direction",
    ". we then obtain pressure plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : prs - pirho ] as a function of the mass ratio @xmath19 at zero temperature .",
    "interpolating these data , we find @xmath9 for each value of @xmath19 .",
    "figure [ fig : prs - ttc ] shows the pressure as a function of @xmath20 at fixed @xmath19 . here",
    "@xmath21 is the pseudo - critical temperature at the same value of @xmath19 .",
    "the temperature scale is set by @xmath22 through @xmath23 with @xmath24 the pseudo - critical coupling .",
    "we find that the pressure for fixed @xmath20 depends only weakly on the quark mass even for relatively heavy quark in the range @xmath250.8 . for heavier quark masses , the pressure decreases toward the pure gauge value ( dashed line ) @xcite as expected .",
    "we also note that the magnitude of pressure is much larger than that for the pure gauge system for @xmath0 , and that it overshoots the stefan - boltzman value in the continuum at high temperatures .",
    "these features are probably the result of large discretization errors from the clover quark action here @xcite . indeed the large stefan - boltzman value on an @xmath0 lattice shown at the top - right in fig .",
    "[ fig : prs - ttc ] is dominated by the quark contribution .",
    "the chiral phase transition of two - flavor qcd is expected to belong to the universality class of o(4 ) spin system in three dimensions . in particular , identifying the magnetization , external magnetic field , and reduced temperature of the spin model with @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the chiral transition point , we expect a scaling relation @xmath30 to hold with the o(4 ) scaling function @xmath31 @xcite and the o(4 ) critical exponents @xmath18 and @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "a previous study using the rg - improved gauge action and unimproved wilson quark action @xcite found this relation to be well satisfied for the quark mass and the chiral condensate defined by axial ward identities @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : o4 ] shows the result of a similar analysis from the present work .",
    "data for @xmath33 are fitted to the scaling relation , adjusting @xmath29 and the scales for @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the scaling ansatz works well , yielding @xmath36 for the best fit of data for @xmath37 and @xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
