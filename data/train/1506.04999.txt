    "one of the main achievements in quantum information theory has been the development of a generalization of shannon s theory for quantum communication@xcite . in particular , the holevo bound @xcite sets a limit on the rate of reliable transmission of classical information through a quantum channel , which is also achievable in the asymptotic limit of infinitely long sequences @xcite . consequently , via proper optimization and regularization @xcite , it provides the quantum analog of the shannon classical capacity formula .",
    "+ the original proof  @xcite was carried out by extending to the quantum regime the concept of typical subspaces used in shannon communication theory @xcite .",
    "a crucial point is the choice of a proper povm which allows bob to identify the right message with small error probability .",
    "the first explicit detection scheme used in this context is a one - step collective - measurement povm known as _ pretty good measurement _",
    "( pgm ) @xcite , highly effective theoretically but not easily realizable in practice .",
    "+ following the proof of ogawa and nagaoka @xcite , hayashi and nagaoka @xcite , which establishes a connection with the quantum - hypotesis - testing problem @xcite , the possibility of asymptotically achieving the bound through a series of `` yes - no '' projective measurements was investigated @xcite . this sequential protocol checks whether the received state resides in the typical subspace of a given codeword , for each codeword in the code , until it receives a positive answer or else declares failure .",
    "the `` yes - no '' question is asked , for each codeword , by applying the projector on its typical subspace and thus makes the decoding protocol more suited for practical implementations than the pgm .",
    "indeed a design for an explicit and structured optical receiver was proposed @xcite , which used this protocol , with applications both to optical communication and quantum reading . in particular , for a lossy bosonic channel  @xcite ( a model most commonly used to represent realistic fiber and free - space communication ) it was shown that the sequential decoder can be built with gaussian displacement operators and vacuum - or - not measurements  @xcite .",
    "an alternative , near - explicit approach , for capacity - achieving classical - quantum communication was also recently developed by wilde and guha@xcite , adapting to the quantum scenario the classical polar coding introduced by arikan@xcite .",
    "in particular , making use of optimal helstrom measurements in the quantum - hypotesis - testing procedure and of sen s non - commutative union bound@xcite , they proposed an encoding technique which realizes channel polarization and consequently introduced a quantum successive cancellation decoder .",
    "later work modified such decoding strategy to obtain a partially non - collective measurement@xcite and extended polar coding to private and quantum communication through arbitrary qubit channels@xcite .",
    "the relevance of this approach is associated with the fact that , at variance with other proposals  @xcite , it allows optimal decoding with a linear ( in the amount of bits ) number of collective measurements .",
    "+ in this paper we propose a bisection decoding scheme for classical communication through a quantum channel and show that it achieves the maximum capacity in the asymptotic limit of infinitely long codewords , providing yet an alternative proof of the attainability of the holevo bound . while being inspired to the sequential decoding algorithm  @xcite , analogously to refs .",
    "our scheme exhibits an exponential advantage in the number of measurements which have to be performed in order to recover the message : specifically if the sequential method is built on @xmath2 concatenated `` yes - no '' detections , where @xmath1 is the number of codewords , the bisection method only requires @xmath0 of such  atomic \" steps , thus scaling linearly with the number of bits @xmath3 which one wishes to transmit .",
    "we stress however that , being our individual detections explicitly many - body operations , at present we have no evidence in support of the fact that such advantage could be translated in a decoding scheme which is efficient from the computational point of view , i.e. in terms of the number of quantum gates one has to apply to the received string of quantum information carriers.a similar problem arises also in the case of polar codes ( see e.g. ref .  ) , and it is caused by the lack of an explicit implementation ( or at least of an estimate of its complexity ) of the `` atomic '' steps involved in the two protocols , i.e. the `` yes - no '' set detections for the present method and the helstrom measurement for polar coding .",
    "still we believe that our method can be of some interest as it widens the class of known decoding strategies which are asymptotically optimal , increasing hence the chances of identifying at least one which is suitable to implementations . in this respect",
    "it is also worth noticing that the proposed scheme exhibits the nontrivial advantage of gaining a bit of information at each step of the procedure , a feature which may be extremely appealing when dealing with faulty decoders , as it allows partial identification of the transmitted message even in the presence of subsequent detection failures .    as in all the previous works on the subject , in our derivation we heavily rely on the structure of typical projectors , although we need to properly combine them in order to build efficient `` yes - no '' set measurements which reconstruct the message bit - by - bit by checking , at each step of the procedure , whether the received message belongs to one of two possible sets of codewords . in a effort to make the paper",
    "self - contained , we reproduce a series of known results  @xcite providing , in some cases , alternative proofs which are explicitly presented in the framework which best fits with the proposed approach .",

    "it is known that the inequality  ( [ bound ] ) is achievable , in the sense that , for any output ensemble @xmath38 , one can identify a set @xmath25 of @xmath39 quantum codewords and a decoding povm  ( [ povm ] ) for which the error probability goes to zero as @xmath3 increases .",
    "this can be done by exploiting what , in classical information theory , is known as shannon s averaging trick .",
    "the idea is as follows : the ensemble @xmath40 can be seen as a source which , when operating @xmath3 times , will produce @xmath3-long product states @xmath41 of the form with probability @xmath42 therefore iterating @xmath1 times this operation , @xmath40 will be able to generate a code @xmath25 defined as in eq .",

    "accordingly , instead of optimizing the total error probability  ( [ err ] ) of a single element of such a set , we can now consider its averaged value with respect to the probability @xmath46 , @xmath47 the rationale being that if this quantity can be forced to go to zero in the limit @xmath28 then at least one ( actually almost all ) code exists in @xmath48 for which @xmath49 tends to zero in the same limit .    the first proof  @xcite of this fact made use of a single - step decoding povm  ( [ povm ] ) , known as _ pretty good measurement _ ( pgm ) or _ square root measurement _ , which is extremely efficient from a theoretical point of view but difficult to implement .",
    "more recently , a sequential decoding scheme has been introduced  @xcite , which makes use of projective `` yes - no '' measurements to verify whether the received state corresponds to a certain codeword or not . following an arbitrary ordering of codewords",
    ", this question is asked for each of them in turn , until either a positive answer is obtained for some @xmath50 or else a negative answer for all the codewords . to some extent",
    "the sequential scheme appears to be easier to realize in practice as it decomposes the process into a series of simple steps , and indeed several proposals have been made for its use in the context of continuos variable communication lines  @xcite .",
    "still it has a major drawback in its scaling , since an order of @xmath30 operations is required for its application .",
    "the protocol presented here is inspired by the sequential decoding but makes use of a bisection method , performing at each step a `` yes - no '' measurement for a set of possible codewords , whose size is progressively halved , allowing bob to recover the transmitted message bit - by - bit .",
    "this section reviews some basic facts about typical subspaces and presents some inequalities which will be useful in proving the optimality of our decoding scheme . for a complete description of the following properties we refer the reader to refs .  .",
