    "entanglement , first recognized as the characteristic trait of quantum mechanics  @xcite , has been used for a long time as the main indicator of the quantumness of correlations . indeed , as shown in ref .",

    "however , the role played by entanglement in mixed - state computation is less clear .",
    "for instance , in the so - called deterministic quantum computation with one qubit ( dqc1 ) protocol  @xcite , quantum speed - up can be achieved using factorized states . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , speed - up could be due to the presence of another quantifier , the so called quantum discord  @xcite , which is defined as the difference between two quantum analogs of the classical mutual information .",
    "the relationship between entanglement and quantum discord has not been completely understood , since they seem to capture different properties of the states . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is shown that even if quantum discord and entanglement are equal for pure states , mixed states maximizing discord in a given range of classical correlations are actually separable .",
    "the relation between discord and entanglement has been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , and an operational meaning in terms of state merging has been proposed in  @xcite .",
    "recently , the use of quantum discord has been extended to multipartite states .",
    "a measure of genuinely multipartite quantum correlations has been introduced in  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , an attempt to generalize the definition of quantum discord in multipartite systems based on a collective measure has been proposed . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors proposed different generalizations of quantum discord depending on the measurement protocol performed .",
    "entanglement in multipartite systems has been shown to obey monogamy in the case of qubits  @xcite and continuous variables  @xcite .",
    "monogamy means that if two subsystems are highly correlated , the correlation between them and other parties is bounded .",

    "they also suggested , based on numerical results , that w states are likely to violate monogamy .",
    "in this brief report , using the koashi - winter formula  @xcite , we prove that , for pure states , quantum discord and entanglement of formation obey the same monogamy relationship , while , for mixed states , distributed discord exceeds distributed entanglement .",
    "then , we give an analytical proof of the violation of monogamy by all w states .",
    "furthermore , we suggest the use of the interaction information  @xcite as a measure of monogamy for the mutual information . finally , as a further application of koashi - winter equality , we prove , the conjecture on upper bounds of quantum discord and classical correlations formulated by luo _",

    "given a measure of correlation @xmath24 , monogamy implies a tradeoff on bipartite correlations distributed along all the partitions @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) : @xmath27 coffman , kundu , and wootters  @xcite showed that this property applies to three - qubit states once the square of the concurrence  @xcite ( @xmath28 ) plays the role of @xmath24 .",
    "the extension of the proof to @xmath29-partite ( @xmath30 ) qubit systems has been given in ref .",

    "actually , a numerical analysis shows that about half of them do not respect monogamy . to see a transition from observation to violation of monogamy , we consider the family of states @xmath54 .",

    "( [ kw ] ) becomes an inequality : @xmath69 .",
    "then , @xmath70 , or , using the subadditivity of von neumann entropy , @xmath71 thus , for mixed states , monogamy of quantum discord has a stricter bound than monogamy of entanglement .",
    "the search for monogamy of correlations can be extended to @xmath72 .",
    "it is actually easy to note that , for pure tripartite states , monogamies of quantum discord and classical correlations are complementary , that is @xmath73 . to prove it , it is sufficient to observe that mutual information obeys @xmath74 the generalization of eq .",

    "the interaction information has been introduced with the aim of measuring the information that is contained in a given set of variables and that can not be accounted for considering any possible subset of them .",

    "@xcite , it can not be used as a correlation measure .",
    "then , its meaning is widely debated .",
    "equation  ( [ minfxmon ] ) suggests that it plays the role played by the tangle in the distribution of @xmath28  @xcite , since it is invariant under index permutation , and it can be called a `` mutual information tangle . '' when @xmath86 is negative , it quantifies the lack of monogamy of the mutual information . as shown by prabhu _",
    ", monogamy of discord relies on the relationship between @xmath86 and its interrogated version  @xcite .",

    "if inequality  ( [ discmix ] ) were an equality , it would be easy to extend the proof to discord .",
    "actually , inequality  ( [ discmix ] ) is telling us that distributed discord could exceed distributed entanglement , and these upper bounds could be violated . while a a partial proof of the conjecture has been given in ref .",
    "@xcite using the language of quantum operations , a full proof for the case of rank 2 states of two qubits can be given using the koashi - winter formula . by applying a purification procedure ,",
    "we add an ancillary hilbert space @xmath90 and write a pure tripartite state @xmath91 such that @xmath92 . since @xmath87 has rank 2 , @xmath91 is a three - qubit state . as a consequence of eq .",
