    "the isotropic majority - vote ( mv ) model for opinion dynamics is a well - known nonequilibrium spin model which has been studied by many researchers , see eg .",
    "one of the reasons , why physicists became interested in the model , is its critical behavior .",
    "the model was originally introduced in 1992 , in ref .",
    "@xcite , where , for the two - dimensional square lattice , it was shown to have a continuous phase transition with the same static critical exponents as the 2d ising model .",
    "this result was an important confirmation of an earlier hypothesis according to which nonequilibrium models with up - down symmetry and spin - flip dynamics fall within the universality class of the equilibrium ising model @xcite .",
    "since then , there have been many numerical studies aimed at final approval or rejection of that hypothesis for different models . in particular , a number of monte carlo simulations of the mv model on regular lattices and random networks have been carried out providing contradictory conclusions ( cf .",
    "eg .  @xcite and @xcite ) and leaving unsolved the problem of its universality classes .",
    "for example , it is still controversial whether the upper critical dimension of the mv model on @xmath0-dimensional hypercubic lattices is @xmath1 ( as in the ising model ) or @xmath2 ( as suggested in @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , mean - field critical exponents for the mv model have not yet been exactly determined , although their numerical values seem to agree with the results known for the ising model .",
    "this contribution is the first of two , in which we refer to the last point among those listed at the end of the previous paragraph . here",
    ", we present exact solution of the isotropic majority - vote model on the complete graph of @xmath3 nodes .",
    "we provide the probability distribution , @xmath4 , of finding the system in a certain microstate @xmath5 , where @xmath6 denotes the spin variable associated to the site @xmath7 and @xmath3 is the total number of sites .",
    "we show that the probability depends only on the absolute value of magnetization : @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the standard noise parameter of the majority - vote model ( see eq .",
    "( [ rate0 ] ) for its formal definition ) . given the result",
    ", we also show that the mv model on the complete graph fulfills the detailed - balance condition : just as the one - dimensional mv model @xcite and unlike the model on the two - dimensional square lattice @xcite . in the next paper",
    ", we study critical properties of the model and determine exact values of its mean - field critical exponents .",
    "the isotropic majority - vote model is a spin model in which to each site @xmath7 a spin variable @xmath6 is assigned . in the rest of this paper ,",
    "the global configuration of the system is denoted by @xmath11 where @xmath3 is the total number of sites .",
    "the dynamics of the model is such that , at any time step , only one site has its spin modified .",
    "let us assume that the considered spin is @xmath12 .",
    "the transition rate from a configuration @xmath13 to another configuration @xmath14 which only differs from @xmath13 by the sign of the @xmath7th spin variable , is given by @xmath15,\\ ] ] where @xmath16 takes one of three values @xmath17 depending on the local magnetization , @xmath18 of the nearest neighborhood of @xmath12 .",
    "the role of the noise parameter @xmath10 can be easily deduced from eq .",
    "( [ rate0 ] ) . in the case , when , in the initial configuration @xmath13 , the sign of the variable @xmath12 is consistent with the sign of its neighborhood , i.e. @xmath19 , the transition rate , which is proportional to the probability that @xmath12 changes the sign to the opposite , is equal to @xmath20 . otherwise , when @xmath21 one has @xmath22 .",
    "thus , the transition rate from a spin configuration @xmath13 to @xmath23 is @xmath24 if the flipping follows the majority rule among the nearest neighbors of @xmath7 , and @xmath10 if it does not .",
    "the case when @xmath25 corresponds to @xmath26 , which means that the chosen site takes either sign with equal probability . from the above discussion",
    ", it is clear that the parameter @xmath10 in the mv model can be interpreted as an effective temperature .",
    "however , the meaning of @xmath10 is much richer .",
    "in particular , when @xmath27 the majority rule mimics a kind of ferromagnetic coupling in the system , while @xmath28 corresponds to anti - ferromagnetic coupling . finally , when @xmath29 the model behaves like a typical paramagnet .",
    "the time evolution of the majority - vote model is governed by the master equation : @xmath30,\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the time - dependent microstate distribution , i.e. the probability of occurrence of configuration @xmath13 at time @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is the transition rate from @xmath13 to @xmath23 , which is given by eq .",
    "( [ rate0 ] ) . in the stationary regime ,",
    "when @xmath34 eq .",
    "( [ mastereq0 ] ) simplifies to the following balance equation : @xmath35=0,\\ ] ] which , in general and differently than it is in the ising model , can not be further simplified to the detailed balance condition : @xmath36    with regard to the majority - vote model , the only known exception to eq .",
    "( [ mastereq3 ] ) is the one - dimensional chain of spins , which is equivalent to the 1d glauber model , whose dynamics may be interpreted as a dynamics for the 1d ising model ( see @xcite , chap .",
    "in other words , in the stationary regime , the one - dimensional mv model is equivalent to the 1d ising model .",
    "therefore , its stationary distribution @xmath4 is the boltzmann - gibbs distribution . in higher dimensions",
    ", one believes that the mv model does not show microscopic reversibility which underlies the detailed balance , although , in a similar way to what happens in the microscopically reversible ising model , the mv model exhibits continuous phase transitions .",
    "( the lack of microscopic reversibility in the square - lattice mv model is simply shown in ref .",

    "12.6 . ) for example , in the stationary regime , for small values of the parameter @xmath10 , the square - lattice mv model presents a ferromagnetic phase characterized by the presence of a majority of spins with the same sign . above the critical value @xmath37 @xcite of the noise parameter",
    ", the model presents a paramagnetic state with equal , in the average , number of spins with distinct signs .",
    "furthermore , it is known that the square - lattice mv model falls into the same universality class as the 2d ising model .",
    "recent numerical simulations indicate that these findings may also be true in higher dimensions , for @xmath38 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "one still lacks strict theoretical results concerning , in particular , the mean field critical behavior of the model .    in the next section ,",
    "starting with the balance equation , eq .",
    "( [ mastereq2 ] ) , we find recurrence relations for the probability , @xmath4 , of finding the mv model on a complete graph in a given spin configuration , @xmath13 .",
    "then , we derive exact formulas for @xmath4 and @xmath39 , with the latter being the probability that the system has a magnetization equal to @xmath40 .",
    "we also show that the mv model on complete graphs fulfills the detailed balance condition .",
    "our theoretical predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations .",
    "let us note that , in the case of a complete graph , the local magnetization , eq .",
    "( [ defmi ] ) , of each node is @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the total magnetization of the system in a spin configuration @xmath13 .",
    "later in the text , if not explicitly stated otherwise , quantities such as magnetization , @xmath40 , the number of positive spins , @xmath43 , and the spin variable , @xmath12 , always refer to the configuration @xmath13 .",
    "accordingly , if we want to emphasize that these variables refer to another configuration , e.g. @xmath23 , we write it in the following way : @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .    given eq .",
