    ", the idea of the mrj state has replaced the mathematically ill - defined notion of random close packing @xcite .",
    "nearly half - a - century ago these systems were thought to describe the disordered structure of liquids @xcite , but it is now known that three - dimensional mrj monodisperse sphere packings possess unusual quasi - long - range ( qlr ) pair correlations decaying as @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this property is markedly different from typical liquids , in which pair correlations decay exponentially fast @xcite .",
    "similar qlr behavior has also been observed in noninteracting spin - polarized fermionic ground states @xcite , the ground state of liquid helium @xcite , and the harrison - zeldovich power spectrum of the density fluctuations of the early universe @xcite .",
    "however , for each of these examples and for mrj hard sphere packings , the structural origins of these correlations have been heretofore unknown , even for monodisperse systems .",

    "motivated by the observation that mrj packings are structurally rigid with a well - defined contact network , torquato and stillinger conjectured @xcite that all strictly jammed ( i.e. , mechanically rigid ) , saturated @xcite packings of monodisperse spheres in @xmath2-dimensional euclidean space @xmath4 are hyperuniform , meaning that infinite - wavelength local density fluctuations vanish @xcite , a proposition for which no counterexample has been found to date @xcite .",

    "hyperuniform point patterns possess local density fluctuations that asymptotically grow more slowly than the volume of the window .",
    "recently , the concept of hyperuniformity has been extended to include systems composed of finite - volume inclusions of arbitrary geometries @xcite ; in these cases , the quantity of interest is the fluctuation in the so - called local volume fraction , defined as the fraction of the volume within an observation window covered by a given phase .",

    "the situation is apparently even more complex for the polydisperse system in figure [ figone ] since the size distribution results in a highly inhomogeneous local structure with small particles trapped between larger ones with a high probability .",

    "first , what is the appropriate extension of the torquato - stillinger conjecture for monodisperse mrj packings to systems with a size distribution ? clearly , one must explicitly account for the shape information of the particles .",
    "second , in the event that one can generalize the torquato - stillinger conjecture , there is to date no satisfactory structural explanation for the _ linear _ small - wavenumber scaling of the structure factor observed for 3d mrj monodisperse hard sphere packings , which indicates the presence of qlr pair correlations .",
    "this extraordinarily difficult problem is tantamount to providing an analytical prediction of the mrj state .",
    "unfortunately , no such rigorous theory currently exists , even for the considerably simpler problem of predicting the scalar mrj density @xcite .",
    "the presence of qlr correlations makes this problem inherently nonlocal , and , therefore , methods that attempt to predict the mrj state based only on packing fraction and local criteria , such as nearest - neighbor and voronoi statistics , are invariably incomplete @xcite .",

    "3 .   strict jamming places a strong constraint on the distribution of the available void space external to the particles such that hyperuniformity is observed when considering local - volume - fraction fluctuations , even when the point pattern of the sphere centers is locally inhomogeneous .",

    "since the integer packing is not even strictly jammed , this comparison suggests that strict jamming is neither a necessary nor a strong determinant of hyperuniformity in heterogeneous media .",
    "identifying the origin of the linear small - wavenumber region of the spectral density is an open problem that must be related to the structural features of the mrj state .",
    "this problem is particularly difficult for our polydisperse packings since the underlying point pattern generated by the particle centroids possesses non - vanishing infinite - wavelength local number density fluctuations .",

    "this result follows directly from an expansion of .",
    "as @xmath139 , we therefore find @xmath146 implying that the particle volumes provide the appropriate _ weights _ to properly balance the small- and large - particle variances with the covariance between the particles .",
    "additionally , since @xmath134 possesses no linear term in its small - wavenumber taylor expansion , it follows that the appearance a linear small - wavenumber region in the spectral density , and therefore qlr correlations , _ must _ involve an appropriate superposition of linear contributions in the partial structure factors .",
    "this observation suggests that quasi - long - range correlations in mrj packings arise from the competing effects of strict jamming and maximal randomness .",
    "incompressibility of the structure from strict jamming implies that particles should be correlated over several characteristic length scales ; indeed , along the equilibrium branch of the binary hard - disk phase diagram , one expects that correlations become fully long - ranged at the close - packed density , corresponding to phase - separated lattice structures @xcite . however , maximal randomness interferes with this long - range order , resulting in the apparent @xmath1 asymptotic scaling in the pair correlation function . for our binary packings , this",
    "scaling is encoded in the partial pair correlations of the structure , which , after appropriate weighting with the shape information of the particles , induces hyperuniformity .",
    "we emphasize that a complete explanation for the appearance of the linear small - wavenumber region of the spectral density is intractable because the problem is inherently non - local due to hyperuniformity and the presence of qlr correlations .",
    "furthermore , it has recently been established that decreasing the exponential scaling of the small - wavenumber is associated with greater disorder within a many - particle system , potentially even inducing clustering among the particles @xcite , an effect clearly inconsistent with strict jamming .",
    "more generally , hyperuniformity is associated with an effective interparticle repulsion that attempts to evenly distribute the particles throughout space , and the length scale of this repulsion increases with increasing exponential scaling of the small - wavenumber region of the spectral density @xcite .",
    "the conditions of saturation and impenetrability in an mrj packing induce structural order that apparently competes with the constraint of maximal randomness to minimize the scaling of the small - wavenumber region of the spectral density to its smallest integer value , an effect that we argue is physically tied to the void - space distribution of the system .",
    ", as a function of the radii of the particles in the packing .",
    "a uniform decrease in the particle radii defines a basin of hyperuniform systems.,scaledwidth=65.0% ]    to motivate our discussion of the void space and its fundamental importance to polydisperse mrj packings , we mention a peculiar property of hyperuniformity in these packings .",
    "namely , one can maintain hyperuniformity in polydisperse mrj hard - particle systems even upon shrinking the particles at a fixed size ratio so long as one does not affect the underlying statistical distribution of the point process ; this effect is illustrated in figure [ figninea ] .",
    "to understand this behavior , we note that the leading - order term governing the expansion of the fourier transform of the particle indicator function @xmath134 is the volume of the particle @xmath147 , meaning that for small wavenumbers we have ( in the case of the binary packings ) @xmath148 which , upon rescaling @xmath149 for @xmath150 , suggests @xmath151 therefore , hyperuniformity of the mrj binary packing is not lost when performing this scaling operation .",
    "physically , the small - wavenumber region of the spectral density effectively homogenizes the medium due to the coupling between the wavenumber and the particle radius in the indicator function @xmath134 , meaning that this region is not affected by changes at the boundaries of the particles so long as the underlying statistics of the point pattern generating the medium remain constant .",
    "this observation suggests that a saturated and strictly jammed sphere packing extends naturally to an uncountably infinite family of hyperuniform heterogeneous media related by an appropriate scaling parameter .",
    "one can map this behavior directly using the result , which indicates that the spectral density at small wavenumbers defines a quadratic form in the particle radii when the underlying point pattern of the disk centers is held fixed ; the corresponding curve is plotted in figure [ qformfig ] .",
    "furthermore , this scaling has the effect of deforming the void space surrounding the particles in a _ uniform _ manner that preserves the regularity of the pore distribution even upon breaking both the jamming and saturation constraints .",
    "the medium therefore is able to retain information from the strictly jammed configuration even upon relaxing the sizes of the inclusions .",
    "additionally , it follows from the quadratic form that _ non - uniform _ changes in the particle radii inherently break the hyperuniformity of the packing .    .",
    "the parameter @xmath152 is the scaling factor.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    this behavior has important implications for mrj packings .",
    "first , this effect is geometric in origin and depends on the explicit inclusion of particle shape information to appropriately balance the partial structure factors of the packing .",
    "this observation immediately implies that `` point '' information contained in the particle centers is not sufficient to describe the system .",
    "second , the presence of interparticle contacts is not essential for the onset of hyperuniformity and qlr correlations .",
    "this subtle point , though easy to appreciate mathematically , is highly nontrivial from a physical perspective .",
    "it implies that on the _ global _ scale of the microstructure , the space is regularized in such a way that hyperuniformity is preserved upon making uniform scaling deformations of the particle phase .",
    "importantly , since the spectral density is a descriptor of both the particle and the void phases , this homogenization is invariant to the choice of reference phase .",
    "note in particular that upon breaking the contact network of the mrj packing , the void space can become _ connected _ throughout the space , implying that the spatial statistics of the microstructure must account for correlations over large length scales .",
    "it is for these reasons that we turn our attention to the void - space distribution in the following sections .",
    "note that our scaling analysis does not apply if the particle radii are uniformly increased since breaking the impenetrability constraint implies that higher - order microstructural information is necessary to characterize the medium , and is no longer valid . additionally ,",
    "if the particles are shrunk to the point that the small particle radius vanishes , then the packing will no longer be hyperuniform since important shape information about the system has been lost . in terms of the void space , the distribution of pore sizes will be skewed toward higher values due to the sudden appearance of `` holes '' in the microstructure , corresponding to the lost small particles , thereby de - regularizing the microstructure and breaking hyperuniformity .",
    "it is clear from the discussion above that the void phase surrounding the disk inclusions of the binary mrj packings plays a significant role in characterizing local fluctuations in the medium .",
    "indeed , we argue that the conditions of strict jamming and saturation place strong constraints on the distribution of the pore sizes , effectively regularizing the local structure around each disk such that the system is hyperuniform with respect to local - volume - fraction fluctuations even though the disk centers do not consitute a hyperuniform point pattern . to support our arguments concerning the void space , we have quantified the size of the available void space using the so - called _ complementary pore - size cumulative distribution function _",
    "@xcite , which represents the fraction of the void space external to the inclusion phase with a pore radius larger than @xmath154 .",
    "equivalently , if we define @xmath155 as the probability density that a randomly chosen point in the void space lies within @xmath154 and @xmath156 from the _ nearest _ point on the void - inclusion interface , then : @xmath157    figure [ porefig ] shows the cumulative pore - size distribution function for the binary mrj packings along with the corresponding results for the integer and binary integer packings and a system of equilibrium monodisperse hard disks at volume fraction @xmath158 .",
    "the equilibrium hard disk packing is neither saturated nor jammed ; it is also known that this system is not hyperuniform @xcite . as a result , it possesses a broad distribution of pore sizes , and the probability of finding large pores ( i.e. , on the order of a particle diameter ) is nonvanishing . in contrast , both the integer packing and its binary variant possess narrow pore - size distributions with compact supports , which result from the close - packed nature of the packings .",
    "interestingly , figure [ porefig ] indicates that the binary mrj packing also possesses a narrow pore - size distribution that essentially falls between the square and binary square packings .",
    "this observation suggests that the void space is highly constrained by the condition of strict jamming and almost regular in its distribution .     for the binary mrj packing , the square lattice @xmath159 , a saturated binary variant of @xmath159 , and a system of equilibrium hard spheres with volume fraction @xmath158.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    one can directly compute the moments @xmath160 of the pore size density from the cumulative distribution @xmath153 using the relation @xcite : @xmath161 lower - order moments of the pore - size density arise in bounds on the mean survival times and principal relaxation times of heterogeneous materials and are thus important descriptors of microstructures @xcite ( see section v.b below ) . table [ tableone ] provides the first moments and standard deviations of the pore size for the systems mentioned in figure [ porefig ] .",
    "the average pore sizes for the hyperuniform systems are significantly smaller than for the equilibrium hard disk packing . in fact",
    ", the pore size distribution of the binary mrj packing appears to be more localized about its mean than even the integer packing .",
    "we conclude from this information that the available void space in the binary mrj disk packing is sufficiently restricted such that local volume fraction fluctuations decay faster than the volume of an observation window , thereby reflecting the underlying regularity of the pore space .",
    ".first moments and standard deviations of the pore size for distributions of hard disks . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is interesting to note that the series lower bound provides a better estimate of the mean pore size than the poisson upper bound .",
    "this observation is reasonable since the compact support of the lower bound more closely matches the behavior of the actual pore - size distribution , which also has compact support due to the saturation of the packing .",
    "however , it is unclear if the constraint of saturation can be relaxed while still maintaining hyperuniformity in the medium .",
    "one can conjecture that so long as the probability of finding a large pore decays faster than the corresponding behavior for a poisson pattern , then hyperuniformity holds .",
    "although our results provide a quantitative basis for understanding the appearance of hyperuniformity in polydisperse mrj packings , a complete explanation for the linear scaling of the small - wavenumber region of the spectral density is still not apparent .",
    "again , we emphasize that this problem is inherently non - local , and its solution must account for the presence of qlr correlations within the packing .",
    "such correlations are difficult to discern with the distribution @xmath153 that we have presented here , which is essentially a one - point descriptor of heterogeneous media @xcite .",
    "in the following section , we characterize the allowable @xmath3-particle loops within a binary mrj packing .",
    "this analysis suggests that the variance in pore sizes is bounded by the strict jamming of the packings , supporting our argument these constraints are sufficient to induce hyperuniformity .",
    "the preceding discussion shows how the void space is a _",
    "fundamental _ descriptor of a two - phase random heterogeneous medium .",
    "as we have seen , fluctuations in the local volume fraction contain information about the void space and therefore provide a more complete picture of hyperuniformity in heterogeneous media . here",
    "we quantitatively characterize the voids in mrj binary disk packings and argue that strict jamming restricts the variance of pore sizes .",
    "@xmath3-particle void _ is associated with a loop of @xmath3 contacting disks ( an _ @xmath3-particle loop _ ) in which each disk only contacts two neighbors .",
    "these loops are defined topologically , meaning that their identification is invariant to local shears of the particle contacts .",
    "the smallest loops contain three mutually contacting particles .",
    "the constraint of saturation places an upper bound on the number of particles in a loop , and the largest loop we find in the mrj binary disk packings contains 6 particles .",
    "the number of @xmath3-particle loops in a packing decreases rapidly as @xmath3 increases .",
    "the area of the void associated with a loop can be rigorously computed by substracting the area of particles falling into the polygon constructed by connecting the centers of the disks in the loop .",
    "we note that , except for the 3-particle loop , the polygons associated with other @xmath3-loops ( @xmath162 ) can be continuously deformed while maintaining the contacts between the particles .",
    "such deformations change the area of the voids associated with the loop .",
    "the rigidity of mrj packings also strongly constrains the number of particles in a loop . in the mrj packings of binary disks ,",
    "the majority of the voids involve 3-particle loops , which form the `` backbone '' of the network .",
    "certain 4-particle loops can be observed at the effective grain boundaries between disks with different sizes .",
    "a large portion of these 4-particle loops are very distorted with a void area almost equal to that associated with two 3-particle loops .",
    "loops with more particles are rare in the packings , and the observed ones are all strongly distorted with void areas almost equal to those associated with 3- or 4-particle loops .",
    "therefore , we only discuss the voids associated with 3- and 4-particle loops here , focusing on the maximum possible void areas associated with these loops .        there are four distinct 3-particle loops in the binary disk packings as shown in figure [ fig3loop ] . defining the radii of small and large disks",
    "be @xmath163 and @xmath164 , respectively , the @xmath3-particle void areas @xmath165 , normalized by the volume of a small particle , are @xmath166 , @xmath167 , @xmath168 and @xmath169 for a size ratio @xmath170 .",
    "it can be seen clearly that the void areas constitute a small fraction of the small particle area .",
    "since these 3-particle voids dominate the packing , it is reasonable to conclude that the regularity of these local clusters enforces hyperuniformity on the medium despite the nonuniform distribution of the sphere centers .",
    "there are total of six distinct types of 4-particle loops ( see figure [ fig4loop ] ) in the binary disk packings , each associated with a void that can possess a spectrum of shapes and sizes by distorting the quadrangle formed by the centers of the disks .",
    "although most of the void areas associated with these highly distorted 4-particle loops are almost equal to the area associated with two 3-particle loops , there are still relatively large voids .",
    "the maximum normalized void areas are given by @xmath171 , @xmath172 , @xmath173 , @xmath174 , @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "these values are relatively large but more tightly distributed around the mean when compared to the normalized areas for 3-particle voids . as a result",
    ", they can be considered as an estimate of the upper bound on the degree of local inhomogeneity that can be consistent with hyperuniformity of the packings .",
    "we have provided a detailed study of local - volume - fraction fluctuations in mrj packings of polydisperse hard disks and have shown that these systems are hyperuniform with quasi - long - range correlations .",
    "our results strongly suggest that these qlr correlations are a signature of mrj hard - particle packings , in contrast to previous misconceptions in the literature @xcite .",
    "although it is true that the structure factors for these systems do not vanish at small wavenumbers except in the monodisperse limit , we have shown that the more appropriate structural descriptor of mrj packings is the spectral density , which accounts appropriately for the shape information of the particles .",
    "our work therefore generalizes the torquato - stillinger conjecture for hyperuniform point patterns by suggesting that all saturated , strictly - jammed sphere packings are hyperuniform with respect to local - volume - fraction fluctuations .",
    "furthermore , mrj sphere packings are expected to exhibit quasi - long - range pair correlations scaling as @xmath1 in @xmath2 euclidean dimensions .",
    "importantly , this generalization contains previously - published results for monodisperse mrj packings @xcite as the special case where the particle shape information can be rigorously separated from the `` point '' information of the particle centers .",
    "based on the observations that local - volume - fraction fluctuations are invariant to the choice of reference phase and that one can maintain hyperuniformity in mrj polydisperse packings under a uniform scaling deformation of the particles , we have argued that the onset of hyperuniformity and quasi - long - range correlations results from the homogenization of the void space external to the particles .",
    "the conditions of saturation and strict jamming limit the sizes and shapes of the local voids , which are completely determined by the contact network of particles . using a local analysis of the voids and rigorous bounds on the pore - size distribution",
    ", we have argued that the void space is highly constrained by strict jamming , thereby suppressing infinite - wavelength local - volume - fraction fluctuations .",
    "furthermore , we suggest that the presence of quasi - long - range correlations reflects the inherent structural correlations from the contact network between void shapes . specifically , saturation and strict jamming of the packings compete with the maximal randomness of the particle distributions to drive the small - wavenumber region of the spectral density to its smallest integer value .",
    "although our work has addressed important problems related to the structural properties of mrj hard - particle packings , a number of unanswered questions remain .",
    "first , a rigorous foundation for the observed linear scaling in the small - wavenumber region of the spectral density is still missing .",
    "this problem is immensely difficult to handle theoretically because the problem is inherently long - ranged , and any local analysis of the mrj structure will therefore be unable to account correctly for this behavior @xcite .",
    "second , although we have considered only polydisperse mrj packings of @xmath2-dimensional spheres , our results are expected to hold more generally for strictly jammed packings of hard particles of arbitrary geometry .",
    "indeed , our arguments concerning the void space of an mrj packing are easily extended to include these more general cases , and in a companion paper we will provide direct evidence that mrj packings of hard ellipses and superdisks @xcite are also hyperuniform with signature quasi - long - range correlations indicated by linear scaling of the small - wavenumber region of the spectral density . these results will suggest a remarkably strong extension of the torquato - stillinger conjecture , namely that all maximally random strictly jammed saturated packings of hard particles , including those with size- and shape - distributions , are hyperuniform with universal quasi - long - range correlations [ via the two - point probability function @xmath177 scaling asymptotically as @xmath1 .",
    "we mention that recent , independent work , appearing in preprint form shortly after our own manuscript was posted , @xcite has shown that hyperuniformity and vanishing infinite - wavelength local - volume - fraction fluctuations in saturated mrj packings of polydisperse disks are consistent with certain fluctuation - response relations involving a generalized `` compressibility . ''",
    "however , this work does not address the appearance of quasi - long - range pair correlations in mrj hard - particle packings and does not consider mrj packings of nonspherical particles as in our companion paper @xcite .",
    "our arguments suggest in particular that certain quantum many - body systems and cosmological structures with the same linear small - wavenumber scaling in the structure factor @xcite are statistically `` rigid '' in the sense that their microstructures are effectively homogeneous over large length scales with vanishing infinite - wavelength number density fluctuations .",
    "these unique features are inherently linked to the _ structural _ properties of the system , independent of the physical model itself .",
    "finally , we note that the systems examined in this paper are constrained to be both saturated and strictly jammed .",
    "saturation of the packings is responsible for enforcing compact support in the pore - size distribution function and therefore plays an important role in regularizing the void space surrounding the jammed disks .",
    "however , it is not clear if saturation is a necessary condition to ensure hyperuniformity in strictly jammed heterogeneous media ; this situation corresponds to a weakening of the torquato - stillinger conjecture .",
    "namely , what conditions must a strictly jammed but unsaturated packing of hard spheres meet in order to be hyperuniform ?",
    "we note that the event - driven molecular dynamics algorithm used here to generated the binary mrj disk packings inherently precludes the presence of arbitrarily large `` holes '' within the packing .",
    "however , it does produce a small concentration ( @xmath1782.5% ) of `` rattler '' particles , which are particles that are free to move within some small caged region of the packing .",
    "removal of such particles is known to break hyperuniformity of the medium even though the strict jamming of the surrounding structure remains @xcite ; therefore , strict jamming alone is not sufficient to induce hyperuniformity if large holes are `` common enough '' in the statistics of the microstructure .",
    "this scenario corresponds to skewing the pore - size distribution and thereby de - regularizing the void space .",
    "it is indeed possible to construct strictly jammed packings of two - dimensional disks with a hole of arbitrarily large size by starting with a ring of particles encompassing a large pore ; this ring can be jammed by surrounding it with a close - packed collection of particles that approximates an impenetrable `` wall '' ( see figure [ hole ] ) .",
    "one is then free to construct any strictly jammed system of particles outside the hole @xcite .",
    "if such holes are sufficiently rare , then it is possible that the system may still be hyperuniform since the pores do not become very large on average .",
    "the converse statement is not true , meaning that hyperuniformity does not imply strict jamming .",
    "the square lattice in two dimensions is one example of a hyperuniform packing that is not strictly jammed .                                a _ bravais lattice _",
    "is defined by the integer linear combinations of a set of @xmath2 basis vectors in @xmath4 . by taking the union of a bravais lattice with its translate(s ) by one or more vectors",
    ", one can also form periodic non - bravais lattices , also known as lattices with a basis in the physics literature .",
    "unless otherwise stated , in this paper we use the term _ lattice _ to refer exclusively to a bravais lattice .",
    "although we only consider packings in 2d for this study , our results are expected to apply in higher dimensions as well .",
    "we have already seen that our methodology contains known results for 3d monodisperse mrj sphere packings as a special case , and the arguments we make in this section concerning the constrained void space extend directly to higher - dimensional packings .",
    "it is not clear if this analogy can be extended to higher dimensions , where it is intimately related to the problem of finding optimal spherical codes ; see : j. h. conway and n. j. a. sloane , _ sphere packings , lattices and groups _ ( springer , new york , 1999 ) , 3rd ed ."
