    "in a glass - forming liquid , with decreasing temperature , the viscosity and the structural relaxation time grows rapidly , and thus the system exhibits a transition to an amorphous solid  @xcite .",
    "the understanding of the underlying mechanism behind this drastic slowing down is still an open problem in condensed matter physics even though various theories , experiments , and computer simulations have been put forth  @xcite .",
    "the huge increase in relaxation times occurs without any obvious structural change  @xcite .",
    "there is instead a clear change in the dynamics which becomes increasingly heterogeneous as shown by experimental and computational studies  @xcite .",
    "in particular , correlated motion in space and time increases upon lowering temperatures , resulting in dramatic effects such as violations of the stokes - einstein relationship  @xcite .",
    "the increasingly large correlations in the dynamics of supercooled liquids lead to a rather natural definition of growing dynamical length scales and susceptibilities .",
    "indeed , if one borrows the standard relationship between order parameter fluctuations and susceptibilities from the theory of critical phenomena and generalizes the definition of the average order parameter to be the time - dependent correlation function , e.g. the intermediate scattering factor , then one is led naturally to the non - linear , four - point susceptibility @xmath0 as the fluctuation of the order parameter .",
    "additionally , the associated length scale @xmath1 is quantified from the wave number dependence of the four - point correlation function @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "given that @xmath0 measures the spatial correlations in the equilibrium relaxation process , it is natural to ask whether one can define a related response function , again trying to follow the usual route set up in critical phenomena .",
    "intuitively , a local static perturbation should affect the dynamics far away if the system is indeed dynamically correlated .",
    "it was indeed shown that within mode - coupling theory this is the case : the dynamical response function of a supercooled liquid to a _ spatially modulated _ external field yields interesting information pertaining to the length scales of dynamical heterogeneity  @xcite . unlike the case of standard critical phenomena , there is no direct fluctuation - dissipation relation between the equilibrium fluctuations of the dynamical order parameter , @xmath3 , and the susceptibility calculated from the dynamical response of the system to an external field that couples to the fluid density  @xcite .",
    "the latter quantity formally is related to a three - point , as opposed to four - point , correlation function .",
    "this object , distinct from the standard @xmath0 of traditional studies , can be given the physical interpretation as a measure of the `` compressibility '' of dynamical trajectories perturbed by an external field modulated at a fixed length scale .",
    "because inhomogeneous molecular dynamics simulations are considerably more difficult to perform reliably than homogeneous ones , one may ask whether there is any benefit in calculating dynamic heterogeneity length scales from the dynamical response functions alluded to above .",
    "in fact there are several compelling reasons to undertake the study of such quantities .",
    "first , it has been argued on rather general grounds that the correlation functions and susceptibilities evaluated from the response to an external field are less ambiguous with respect to _",
    "ensemble dependence _",
    "indeed , the ensemble dependence of quantities associated with @xmath0 has be the root cause of some degree of confusion related to the interpretation of dynamical heterogeneity length scales  @xcite .",
    "specifically , the behavior of @xmath3 obtained as the @xmath4 limit of @xmath2 is quite intricate because it is expected to be given by two terms : one term is the @xmath3 determined in the specific ensemble and the other term includes the correlations of fluctuations which are suppressed in the chosen ensemble .",
    "second , an untested prediction put forward on rather general grounds is that the length scales associated with the two distinct formulations discussed above are identical  @xcite .",
    "this prediction deserves scrutiny .",
    "third , the formulation of approximate microscopic theories of dynamical heterogeneity such as the `` inhomogeneous mode - coupling theory '' ( imct ) of biroli _ et al .",
    "_ provides quantitative predictions on the dynamical response to spatially modulated external fields  @xcite .",
    "a simulation of such function in model supercooled liquids would provide the first _",
    "direct _ test of the predictions of imct .",
    "a final reason for undertaking a study of dynamical heterogeneity from consideration of the response to an external field is that  if indeed it turns out that this approach may reliably yield information associated with dynamical heterogeneity ",
    "such an avenue may be a fruitful means for extracting dynamical length scales in experiments , in particular in colloidal systems .",
    "the use of laser tweezer technology would allow for a facile route of dynamical heterogeneity length scales in systems for which @xmath0 may be difficult or impossible to estimate  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to establish by numerical simulations that the dynamical response function introduced in the context of imct is indeed able to probe dynamical correlations .",
    "we shall analyze its critical properties , in particular the dynamic correlation length that can be extracted from it , and compare them to their counterparts obtained by usual four point functions .",
    "finally , we will also contrast our numerical findings to the prediction of imct thus performing the first test of this theory .",

    "<S> we examine the critical properties shown by this function , in particular the associated dynamic correlation length , that is found to be comparable to the one extracted from standardly - employed four - point correlation functions . </S>",
