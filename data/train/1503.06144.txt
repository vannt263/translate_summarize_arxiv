    "= -1 power transmission systems have multiple electromechanical oscillatory modes in which power system areas can swing against each other . in large grids , these interarea oscillations typically have low frequency in the range 0.1 to 1.0 hz , and can appear for large or unusual power transfers . poorly damped or negatively damped oscillations can become more frequent as power systems experience greater variability of loading conditions and can lead to equipment damage , malfunction or blackouts .",
    "practical rules for power system security often require sufficient damping of oscillatory modes @xcite , such as damping ratio of at least 5% , and power transfers on tie lines are sometimes limited by oscillations @xcite .",
    "there are several approaches to maintaining sufficient damping of oscillatory modes , including limiting power transfers @xcite , installing closed loop controls @xcite , and the approach of this paper , which is to take operator actions such as redispatching generation @xcite .",
    "it is now feasible to monitor modal damping and frequency online from synchrophasors ( also known as pmus ) @xcite .",
    "suppose that a mode with insufficient damping ratio is detected",
    ". then what actions should be taken to restore the mode damping ?",
    "this paper calculates the best generator pairs to redispatch to maintain the mode damping by combining synchrophasor and state estimator measurements with a new analytic formula for the sensitivity of the mode eigenvalue with respect to generator redispatch .",
    "this formula , previously thought to be unattainable , is derived with a combination of new and old methods in @xcite .",
    "the length of the derivation ( more than 8 pages ) precludes its presentation here . in this paper we state ,",
    "explain , and demonstrate the application of the new formula and show how the terms of the formula could be obtained from power system measurements .",
    "in particular , we propose using synchrophasors to measure the terms of the formula that depend on dynamics and using the state estimator to measure the terms of the formula that depend on statics . in applying a first order sensitivity formula , we assume that the power system ambient or transient behavior is dominated by the linearized dynamics associated with an asymptotically stable operating equilibrium .",
    "= -1 changes in generator dispatch change the oscillation damping by exploiting nonlinearity of the power system : changing the dispatch changes the operating equilibrium and hence the linearization of the power system about that equilibrium that determines the oscillatory modes and their damping .",
    "this open loop approach that applies an operator action after too little damping is detected can be contrasted with an approach that designs closed loop controls to damp the oscillations preventively .",
    "the closed loop control design chooses control gains that appear explicitly in the power system jacobian , whereas generator redispatch changes the jacobian indirectly by changing the operating point at which the jacobian is evaluated .",
    "we now review previous works using generator redispatch to damp oscillations ; these have considered heuristics , brute force computations , and formulas that are difficult to implement from measurements .",
    "these approaches have established that generator redispatch can damp oscillatory modes .",
    "fischer and erlich pioneered heuristics for the redispatch in terms of the mode shapes for some simple grid structures and for the european grid @xcite .",
    "their heuristics seem promising for insights , elaborations and validation , especially since there has also been progress in determining the mode shape from measurements @xcite .",
    "there are also previous approaches that require a dynamic grid model .",
    "the effective generator redispatches can be determined by repetitive computation of eigenvalues of a dynamic power grid model to give numerical sensitivities @xcite .",
    "also , there are exact computations of the sensitivity of the damping from a dynamic power grid model @xcite that are based on the eigenvalue sensitivity formula @xmath0 = -1 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are left and right eigenvectors associated with the eigenvalue @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the derivative of the jacobian with respect to the amount of generator redispatch @xmath5 .",
    "the calculation of @xmath4 involves the hessian and the sensitivity of the operating point to @xmath5 .",
    "however , requiring a large scale power system dynamic model poses difficulties . it is challenging to obtain validated models of generator dynamics over a wide area and particularly difficult to determine dynamic load models that would be applicable online when poor modal damping arises .",
    "we think that a good way to solve the difficulties with online large scale power system dynamic models is to combine models with synchrophasor measurements to get actionable information about mode damping .",
    "in particular , the dynamic information about the power system can be estimated from synchrophasors .",
    "however , formula ( [ reportformula ] ) is not suitable for this purpose since it is not feasible to estimate from measurements the left eigenvector @xmath1 in ( [ reportformula ] ) ( or derivatives of eigenvectors in other versions of ( [ reportformula ] ) ) .",
    "this was a primary motivation for developing our new formula in @xcite .",
    "in particular , the formula shows that the first order effect of a generator redispatch largely depends on the mode shape ( the right eigenvector ) and power flow quantities that can be measured online .",
    "the assumed equivalent generator dynamics only appears as a factor common to all redispatches .",
    "given a lightly damped interarea mode of a system , the method can rank all the possible generators pairs .",
    "the rank is based on the size of the change of the damping ratio of the interarea mode .",
    "the main objective of ranking the generator pairs is to provide advice to the operator of several effective generator redispatches to damp the oscillations from which a corrective action can be selected .",
    "there are many economic goals and operational constraints governing the final selection of an appropriate dispatch by the operator , and the integration of this decision with optimal power flow and the power markets is left to future work .    in this paper , the role in the method of measurements and the formula",
    "are first illustrated in a simple 3-bus system .",
    "then the general formula derived in @xcite is presented . how static and dynamic power quantities",
    "are obtained from measurements is discussed .",
    "the complex denominator of the formula contains the effect of the assumed equivalent generator dynamics , and a technique to obtain from measurements the phase of this complex denominator is presented .",
    "the paper then explains how to calculate the best generator pairs to damp a given mode , and illustrates and verifies the calculation with interarea modes of the new england 10-generator system .",
    "we first present the eigenvalue sensitivity formula for a special case in which the formula simplifies . consider the interarea mode of the simple 3-bus , 3-generator system shown in fig .",
    "[ 3bussystem2 ] .",
    "the generator dynamics is described by the swing equation and the transmission lines are lossless . in this special case ,",
    "the bus voltage magnitudes are assumed constant . at the base case ,",
    "the system is at an stable operating point and fig .",
    "[ 3bussystem2 ] shows the line power flows and the interarea oscillating mode pattern .",
    "the mode pattern shows that generator g1 is swinging against g3 , and that g2 is not participating in the oscillation .",
    "the gray lines joining the buses show the magnitude of the power flow with the grayscale and the direction of the power flow with the arrows .",
    "the red arrows at each bus show the oscillation mode shape ; that is , the magnitude and direction of the complex entries of the right eigenvector @xmath6 associated with the interarea mode . ]",
    "the bus voltage phasor angles are @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath8 and @xmath9 be the voltage angle differences across line 1 and line 2 , and let @xmath10 and @xmath11 be the real power flows through line 1 and line 2 .",
    "the interarea mode has complex eigenvalue @xmath3 and complex right eigenvector @xmath6 .",
    "generator redispatch causes changes in the angles across the lines @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and these in turn cause changes @xmath14 in the eigenvalue . according to @xcite , the formula for the first - order change in @xmath3 with respect to generator redispatch in a 3-bus system with constant voltage magnitudes reduces to @xmath15 all quantities",
    "are in per unit unless otherwise indicated .",
    "the complex denominator @xmath16 seconds depends on the inertia and damping coefficients of the generators , the eigenvalue @xmath3 and its right eigenvector @xmath6 .",
    "the right eigenvector written with components corresponding to the bus angles is @xmath17 .",
    "is the right eigenvector of a quadratic formulation of the eigenvalue problem @xcite , it contains the angle components , but not the frequency components , of the conventional right eigenvector .",
    "that is , the conventional right eigenvector is @xmath18 . ]",
    "the right eigenvector may also be expressed in terms of the angles across the line as @xmath19 .",
    "that is , @xmath20 is the change in the eigenvector across line 1 , and @xmath21 is the change of the eigenvector across line 2 . it is these changes @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the right eigenvector across the lines that appear in ( [ formulavconstant ] )",
    ".    = -1 formula ( [ formulavconstant ] ) is in terms of static load flow quantities @xmath24 and @xmath5 that are available from state estimation , and dynamic quantities @xmath3 and @xmath6 that could be available from synchrophasor measurements .",
    "table [ static and dynamic quantities 3-bus ] shows the values at the base case .",
    "formula ( [ formulavconstant ] ) indicates which lines have suitable power flow and eigenvector components to affect oscillation damping . in particular , it is effective for the redispatch to change the angles across the lines that have both changes in the mode shape across the line and sufficient real power flow in the right direction .",
    ".[static and dynamic quantities 3-bus]quantities from measurements [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath25 is the internal constant voltage magnitude of generator @xmath26 at the base case ; i.e. , at zero redispatch , and @xmath27 is the transient generator reactance .",
    "this appendix proves from ( [ reportformula ] ) that the first order eigenvalue sensitivity to redispatch does not depend on linear parts of the power system model .",
    "this result was first mentioned in @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to use the extended differential - algebraic form of the power system equations @xcite with state vector @xmath28 , jacobian @xmath29 , and extended right and left eigenvectors @xmath30 and @xmath31 . in this notation ,",
    "( 1 ) becomes @xmath32 in this case , the parameter @xmath5 parameterizes the generator redispatch , and it appears linearly in the system equations .",
    "therefore @xmath5 does not appear explicitly in the jacobian @xmath29 , and @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the sensitivity of the operating point @xmath28 to the redispatch .",
    "then substituting in ( [ reportformulabar ] ) and writing it out in coordinates gives @xmath35 it is clear from ( [ lambdap ] ) that the linear parts of the model vanish in @xmath36 and that if a dynamic state is associated with a linear differential equation , the corresponding entry of @xmath31 gets multiplied by zero in the numerator of ( [ lambdap ] ) .",
