    "to predict the transport phenomena of complex fluids caused by the coupled heat and momentum transfer processes is challenging from both a scientific and engineering point of view .",
    "molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations are often used to predict material properties ( e.g. , the rheological , thermal , and electrical properties ) , in which the simulation is performed for a very small piece of the material under a certain ideal environment.@xcite however , in actual engineering and biological systems , the macroscopic features of complex fluids are highly affected by the spatial heterogeneity caused by the macroscopic transport phenomenon involved in the boundary conditions . a typical example is the generation of heat in lubrication systems.@xcite to predict such complicated behavior in complex fluids , the entire system , including the boundary conditions , must be considered on the basis of an appropriate molecular model . in principle , full md simulations of the entire system can meet these requirements . however , it is difficult in practice to perform full md simulations on the macroscopic scale , which is common in actual engineering systems and is far beyond the molecular size .",
    "multiscale modeling is a promising candidate to address this type of problem .",
    "the multiscale simulation for the flow behaviors of complex fluids was first advanced in the connffessit approach for polymeric liquids by laso and ttinger@xcite , where the local stress in the fluid solver is calculated using the microscopic simulation instead of using any constitutive relations .",
    "the generic approach is also presented for the non - isothermal polymeric flows by making important corrections and clarifications to the connffessit scheme.@xcite the strategy exploited in the connffessit approach is also introduced into the heterogeneous multiscale modeling ( hmm ) , which was proposed by e and enquist,@xcite as a general methodology for the efficient numerical computation of problems with multiscale characteristics .",
    "hmm has been applied to various problems , such as the simple polymeric flow@xcite , coarsening of a binary polymer blend@xcite and the channel flow of a simple lennard - jones liquid@xcite .",
    "the equation - free multiscale computation proposed by kevrekids et al .",
    "is also based on a similar idea and has been applied to various problems.@xcite de et al .",
    "proposed the scale - bridging method , which can correctly reproduce the memory effect of a polymeric liquid , and demonstrated the non - linear viscoelastic behavior of a polymeric liquid in slab and cylindrical geometries.@xcite the multiscale simulation for polymeric flows with the advection of memory in two and three dimensions was developed by murashima and taniguchi.@xcite we have also developed a multiscale simulation of md and computational fluid dynamics ( cfd ) .",
    "the multiscale method was first developed for simple fluids@xcite and subsequently extended to polymeric liquids with the memory effect.@xcite    however , a multiscale simulation for the coupled heat and momentum transfer of complex fluids has yet to be proposed . for complex fluids , it is usually difficult to describe the heat generation coupled with the momentum transport using only macroscopic quantities .",
    "the spatial variation in the temperature also becomes notable at the macroscopic scale due to local viscous heating under shear flow .",
    "thus , multiscale modeling is important for the coupled heat and momentum transfer of complex fluids . in the present paper ,",
    "we propose a multiscale simulation , termed the synchronized molecular dynamics simulation ( smd ) , for the coupled heat and momentum transfer in complex fluids by extending the multiscale simulation for momentum transport and apply it to the polymer lubrication . using this method , we investigate the rheological properties and conformation of polymer chains for the thermohydrodynamic lubrication of a polymeric liquid composed of short chains in a gap between parallel plates , in which the width of the gap is sufficiently large compared to the characteristic length of the flow behaviors , e.g. , the length of the viscous boundary layer , such that the macroscopic quantities , e.g. , the velocity , stress and temperature , become spatially heterogeneous .",
    "the full md simulations for confined short - chain molecules in slab geometry were previously studied in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the viscous heating of simple liquids in the same geometry was also studied using a full md simulation in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , these results are exclusively for the molecularly thin films , i.e. , the slab width is approximately ten times the molecular size , whereas in the present study , a width of over a thousand times the molecular size is considered in the smd simulation .    in the following ,",
    "we first describe the problem considered in the present paper .",
    "the simulation method is explained after the presentation of the problem .",
    "the smd simulation of polymer lubrication is performed , and the results are discussed ; these results are mainly the rheological properties and the coupling of the conformations of the polymer chains with heat generation under shear flows .",
    "we also present a critical analysis of the conceptual and technical issues of the smd method .",
    "finally , a short summary and a perspective on the future of smd are given .",
    "we consider a polymeric liquid contained in a gap of width @xmath0 between parallel plates with a constant temperature @xmath1 ( see fig . [ fig_problem](a ) ) . the polymeric liquid",
    "is composed of short kremer - grest chains@xcite of ten beads , in which all of the bead particles interact with a truncated lennard - jones potential defined by @xmath2 + \\epsilon , & \\quad ( r\\le 2^{1/6}\\sigma),\\\\ 0 , & \\quad ( r\\ge 2^{1/6}\\sigma ) , \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] and consecutive beads on each chain are connected by an anharmonic spring potential , @xmath3,\\ ] ] with @xmath4=30@xmath5 and @xmath6=@xmath7 .",
    "the polymeric liquid is in a quiescent state with a uniform density @xmath8 and a uniform temperature @xmath1 before a time @xmath9 .",
    "hereafter , the @xmath10-axis is perpendicular to the parallel plates , and the boundaries between the upper and lower plates and the polymeric liquid are located at @xmath11 and 0 , respectively . the upper plate starts to move in the x direction with a constant shear stress @xmath12 at a time @xmath13=0 , while the lower plate is at rest .",
    "the macroscopic behavior of the polymeric liquid is described by the following transport equations :    [ eq_macro ] @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the velocity , @xmath16 is the stress tensor , @xmath17 is the internal energy per unit mass , and @xmath18 is the shear rate , i.e. , @xmath19 .",
    "hereafter , the subscripts @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 represent the index in cartesian coordinates , i.e. , \\{@xmath20,@xmath21,@xmath22}@xmath23\\{@xmath24,@xmath10,@xmath25}. here , we assume that the macroscopic quantities are uniform in the @xmath24 and @xmath25 directions , @xmath26=@xmath27=0 , and the density of the polymeric liquid is constant .",
    "law for a heat flux with a constant and uniform thermal conductivity @xmath28 is also considered in eq .",
    "( [ eq_ene ] ) .",
    "note that the thermal conductivity of polymeric liquids is anisotropic under shear flows in general@xcite , and some experimental studies have reported that the linear stress - thermal relation between the stress tensor and thermal conductivity holds.@xcite however , in the present study , we only consider the isotropic thermal conductivity as the first step because the effect of shear thinning of the viscosity is thought to be more crucial to viscous heating under strong shear flows than that of the anisotropy of the thermal conductivity .",
    "involving the anisotropic thermal conductivity in the smd simulation is an important future work .",
    "we also assume that the velocity and temperature of the polymeric liquid are the same as those of the plates at the boundaries , i.e. , the non - slip and non - temperature - jump boundary conditions .",

    ", we consider a characteristic temperature necessary to substantially change the viscosity of the polymeric liquid , i.e. , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the characteristic viscosity of the polymeric liquid at a temperature of @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the nahme - griffith number @xmath36 , defined as @xmath37 represents the effect of viscous heating on the changes in the rheological properties.@xcite usually , in lubrication systems and in high - speed processing operations with polymeric liquids , the nahme - griffith number is not negligibly small because of the large viscosity and the small thermal conductivity of the polymeric liquid.@xcite for example , when a lubrication oil in a gap with a width of 1 @xmath38 m is subjected to shear deformation with a strain rate of @xmath39 @xmath40 , the nahme - griffith number is estimated to be @xmath41 .",
    "thus , the rheological properties of the lubricant in such micro devices must be significantly affected not only by the large velocity gradient but also by the temperature increase caused by local viscous heating .",

    "thus , the smd method is not applicable for the dilute polydisperse fluids but is rather designed for dense fluids such as the polymer melt . in the concept of locality of the smd method ,",
    "the viscous diffusion and the vortex structures are resolved in the global mesh system .",
    "thus , the mesh interval and the size of the md cell must be sufficiently small such that the fluid inertia and convection can be ignored at those scales , i.e. , the local reynolds number at the mesh interval @xmath124 must be very small .",
    "this is also related to the technical aspects of the smd method because this condition warrants exploiting the sllod algorithm and the homogeneous rescaling of the kinetic energies in each md cell .",
    "we have proposed a synchronized molecular dynamics simulation via macroscopic heat and momentum transfer and applied this method to the analysis of the lubrication of a polymeric liquid , coupled with viscous heating .",
    "the rheological properties and the conformations of the polymer chains are investigated using a non - dimensional parameter , i.e. , the nahme - griffith number .",
    "the smd simulation demonstrates that strong shear thinning , which is almost inversely proportional to the shear rate , and the transitional behavior for the conformation of the polymer chains occur with a rapid temperature increase when the nahme - griffith number exceeds unity .",
    "the results show that the linear stress - optical relation holds despite the complicated behaviors of the temperature , shear rate , and conformation of the polymer chains .",
    "we have also carried out numerical tests under various calculation conditions by varying the number of mesh intervals @xmath42 ( i.e. , @xmath124=@xmath125 ) , time interval @xmath45 , and number of polymer chains in each md cell @xmath69 and found the following critical issues in the implementation of the smd simulations :    1 .",
    "the time interval @xmath45 must be smaller than the viscous diffusion time @xmath130 , within which the viscous force propagates for the mesh interval @xmath124 ; otherwise , the smd simulations reproduce the solutions with a pseudo viscosity that is smaller than the true viscosity .",
    "2 .   the temperature profile at a small applied shear stress is strongly affected by the noise arising from the local md cells . to obtain an accurate solution , taking the long - time averages as well as increasing the number of particles in each md cell is required .",
    "3 .   concerning the concept of locality in the smd method ,",
    "the flow behaviors involving the viscous dissipation and the vortex structures are resolved in the global mesh system .",
    "thus , the mesh interval @xmath124 and the size of the md cell @xmath72 must be sufficiently small such that the fluid inertia and convection can be ignored at those scales , i.e. , the local reynolds numbers at those scales must be very small .",
    "+    the first issue concerns the numerical stability condition for the macroscopic transport equations eq .",
    "( [ eq_macro ] ) , although the exact stability condition is unknown for the smd method .",
    "the second issue is the consequence of the comparisons between the smd simulations and the analytic solutions . for the present problem",
    ", an smd simulation using 10,000 particles in each md cell can successfully reproduce an accurate temperature profile that is described by the analytic solution .",
    "the third issue is concerned with the locality concept of the smd method , and this also involves the technical aspects of the smd method because the use of the small local reynolds number warrants exploiting the sllod algorithm and the homogeneous rescaling of the kinetic energies at each time interval @xmath45 , which are described in sec .",
    "although these issues must be considered , the smd simulation has two distinctive advantages over the full md simulations : first , the smd simulation can reduce the computational effort ( i.e. , the number of molecules ) compared to that of the full md simulation by a factor of @xmath141 , where @xmath142 is the dimension number of the macroscopic transport equation . in the present simulation ,",
    "the factor is 0.128 because @xmath142 is one .",
    "however , the extension to the two- and three - dimensional cases is also possible by incorporating the algorithms developed in , for example , refs . .",
    "second , almost perfect parallelization efficiency ( i.e. , using @xmath143 cpus in the parallel computation speeds up the calculation compared to using a single cpu by @xmath143 times ) is achieved in a parallel computation with as many cpus as there are md cells by assigning each cpu to an md cell.@xcite this efficiency is obtained because each md simulation is performed independently in the time interval @xmath45 .",
    "the advantage in parallel computation holds not only for the short - range interaction molecular models but also for any complicated molecular models for which the parallelization of md simulations is difficult .",
    "these advantages enable us to analyze the complicated flow behaviors of complex liquids at the macroscopic scales found in actual engineering and biological systems on the basis of the appropriate molecular model .",
    "this study was financially supported by the hyogo science and technology association and by the grant for basic science research projects from the sumitomo foundation .",
