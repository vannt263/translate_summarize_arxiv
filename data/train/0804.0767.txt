    "<S> unlike in the mpd case , which shows resonances for an integer number of optical phonons , the paiei rate shows a much weaker energy dependence . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the paiei rate at the bottom of the each band in _ all chirality _ tubes is largest for the lowest energy dark exciton , while the finite angular momentum , higher energy , dark exciton has the smallest paiei rate ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]a ) . as the doping increases , the paiei rate increases proportionally ( fig .  [ fig3]b ) .    in the low doping limit , which is the main interest here , the eipai rate can be found analytically . </S>",

    "<S> the number of final hole states is given by the density of states , which we calculate using hyperbolic band dispersion @xcite , at the hole energy @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is half the bandgap . </S>",
    "<S> the tail of the exciton wavefunction in momentum space is the key factor determining the paiei rate . in the case of an uncorrelated ( free ) e - h pair , </S>",
    "<S> the two particle wavefunction is a delta function and the paiei decay can not take place . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the reciprocal space wavefunction of the lowest energy exciton is best approximated by the following functional form @xmath46 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the excitonic radius @xmath26 is a fit parameter here and scales with tube diameter @xmath18 and effective dielectric constant @xmath27 as @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> the analytical expression of the paiei decay can then be written as : @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 m / s is the fermi velocity of graphene , @xmath51 is the wavefunction normalization constant , @xmath52 is an effective interband huang - rhys factor . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq2 ] ) fits remarkably well the paiei rate at room temperature and fixed carrier concentration for _ all chirality _ semiconducting tubes with diameter range between 0.8 nm and 2.0 nm and for a variety of @xmath27 with just one adjustable parameter @xmath53 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]c ) . </S>",
    "<S> this value of @xmath52 suggests an electron - phonon coupling @xmath54 ev@xmath22 , which is in good agreement with the calculated value here and measured in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we also note that the paiei decay rate decreases with increasing effective dielectric constant due to the increased exciton radius .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have calculated the non - radiative lifetimes of excited semiconducting cnts via multiphonon decay and by a new , phonon - assisted electronic decay channel , as a function of the cnt diameter . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the mpd rate for free excitons is too slow , especially for small diameter cnts , to account for the experimentally measured decay rates . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , we predict that the mpd decay rate of localized excitons is increased by a few orders of magnitude , due to a coherent contribution of exciton - phonon matrix elements and a stronger effective exciton - phonon coupling . </S>",
    "<S> thus , localized exciton mpd rates can account for a wide range of available experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> exciton localization is usually associated with charge transfer and doping . in these doped tubes , we find that the decay channel involving phonon - assisted indirect exciton ionization can dominate both the free and localized exciton decay , even at moderately small doping levels .    </S>",
