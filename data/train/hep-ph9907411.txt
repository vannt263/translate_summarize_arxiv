    "<S> modifications of @xmath0-mesons formed at the last stage of evolution of hadronic matter produced in heavy ion collisions are studied . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that while the mass shift is on the order of a few tens of mev , the width and spectral density become so broad that @xmath0 may lose its identity as a well defined resonance .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ section ] ]    the problem of how the properties of hadrons change in hadronic or nuclear matter in comparison to their free space values has attracted a lot of attention . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear on physical grounds that the in - medium mass shift and width broadening of a particle are only due to its interaction with the constituents of the medium , for not too dense media anyway . </S>",
    "<S> thus one can use phenomenological information on this interaction to calculate the mass shift and width broadening@xcite .    for meson @xmath1 scattering on hadron @xmath2 in the medium the contribution to the self - energy </S>",
    "<S> is : @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the energy and momentum of the meson , @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the occupation number , and @xmath8 is the forward scattering amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> the normalization of the amplitude corresponds to the standard form of the optical theorem @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the applicability of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) is limited to those cases where interference between sequential scatterings is negligible . in the limit that the target particles @xmath2 move nonrelativistically , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the spatial density . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to the mass shift and width broadening@xcite @xmath12    these relations hold also in the general case provided the amplitudes are averaged over momentum distributions of the constituents . </S>",
    "<S> we assumed@xcite that @xmath0-mesons are formed during the last stage of the evolution of hadronic matter created in a heavy ion collision ,    when the matter can be considered as a weakly interacting gas of pions and nucleons . </S>",
    "<S> this stage is formed when the _ local _ temperature is on the order of 100 to 150 mev and when the _ local _ baryon density is on the order of the normal nucleon density in a nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> the description of nuclear matter as such a gas , of course , can not be considered as a very good one , so it is clear that our results may be only semiquantitative . </S>",
    "<S> the main ingredients of our calculation are on - shell @xmath13 and @xmath14 forward scattering amplitudes and total cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> the scattering amplitudes were obtained by saturation of the low energy part with resonances and using a combination of vector meson dominance ( vmd ) and regge theory at high energy@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> using vmd we are restricted to the case of transversally polarized @xmath0-mesons . </S>",
    "<S> one can argue though , that for unpolarized @xmath0-mesons our results should be multiplied by a factor ranging from 2/3 to 1@xcite . using experimental information on momentum distributions of pions and nucleons and on the @xmath15 ratio </S>",
    "<S> shows that @xmath16 tens of mev , while the width increases by several hundred mev at beam energies of a few gev@xmath17a and by twice that amount at about a hundred gev@xmath17a .    </S>",
    "<S> we also considered@xcite the @xmath0 meson dispersion relation for finite temperature and baryon density for momenta up to a gev / c or so as this is very interesting for the production of dileptons in high energy heavy ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> the dispersion relation is determined by the poles of the propagator after summing over all target species and including the vacuum contribution to the self - energy . in the narrow width approximation </S>",
    "<S> we have @xmath18/e_r(p ) \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> we can also define a mass shift , @xmath20 while @xmath21 in eq.(4 ) coincides with the one in eq.(1 ) for small @xmath22 , the two definitions of width correspond to the rest frame of the @xmath0-meson ( eq.(2 ) ) and to that of the thermal system ( eq.(3 ) ) and differ by the time dilation factor , @xmath23 .    </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate @xmath24 and @xmath25 for @xmath26 = 100 and 150 mev and nucleon densities of 0 , 1 and 2 times normal nuclear matter density ( 0.155 nucleons/@xmath27 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is done by utilizing a fermi - dirac distribution for nucleons . </S>",
    "<S> the nucleon chemical potentials are 745 and 820 mev for densities of 1 and 2 times normal at @xmath26 = 100 mev , and 540 and 645 mev for densities of 1 and 2 times normal at @xmath26 = 150 mev . </S>",
    "<S> anti - nucleons are not included .    </S>",
    "<S> fig.1 shows the mass shift for different temperatures and nucleon densities ( in units of normal nuclear density ) . </S>",
    "<S> the effect with pions alone is negligible ( on the order of 1 mev ) . </S>",
    "<S> the main effect comes from nucleons . </S>",
    "<S> the effective mass increases with nucleon density and with momentum , but is almost independent of temperature . these trends and numbers </S>",
    "<S> are roughly consistent with other analyses @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> fig.2 shows the behavior of the @xmath0 meson width @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> once again pions have very little effect . </S>",
    "<S> the main effect comes from nucleons . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to @xmath0 mesons moving in vacuum or through a pure pion gas the width remains roughly constant with momentum when nucleons are present . </S>",
    "<S> the width is about 240 mev at 1 times nuclear density and about 370 mev at 2 times nuclear density . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the @xmath0 meson becomes a rather poorly defined excitation with increasing nucleon density .    </S>",
    "<S> the rate of dilepton production is proportional to the imaginary part of the photon self - energy @xcite which is itself proportional to the imaginary part of the @xmath0 meson propagator because of vdm@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath29 ^ 2 + [ { \\rm im}\\pi_{\\rho}]^2}\\ ] ] the vacuum part of @xmath30 can only depend on the invariant mass , @xmath31 , whereas the matter parts can depend on @xmath4 and @xmath5 separately . </S>",
    "<S> since we are using the on - shell amplutudes , the matter parts only depend on @xmath5 because @xmath32 is fixed at @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the vacuum parts are obtained from the gounaris - sakurai formula @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the imaginary part of the propagator is proportional to the spectral density . </S>",
    "<S> the former is plotted in fig.3 for a pure pion gas and in fig.4 for a gas of pions and nucleons at @xmath26 and @xmath34 characteristic of the final stages of a high energy heavy ion collision . </S>",
    "<S> pions have very little effect on the spectral density even at such a high temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of nucleons , however , is dramatic . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral density is greatly broadened , so much so that the very idea of a @xmath0 meson may lose its meaning .    </S>",
    "<S> the above remarks on the relative importance of pions and nucleons may need to be re - examined when really applying these calculations to heavy ion collisions , where @xmath35 6 . </S>",
    "<S> the pions seem to be overpopulated in phase space , compared to a thermal bose - einstein distribution , and this could be modeled either by introducing a chemical potential for pions or simply by multiplication by an overall normalization factor . </S>",
    "<S> pions would need to be enhanced by a substantial factor ( 5 or more ) to make a noticeable contribution at a density of 0.155 nucleons per @xmath27@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> recently data in pb - au collisions at 160 gev@xmath17a have been presented @xcite where it was found that the @xmath0-peak is absent at @xmath36 mev , but reappears at @xmath37 mev . </S>",
    "<S> this seems to be just the opposite of our findings . </S>",
    "<S> however , our calculations refer to the @xmath0 momentum relative to the _ local _ rest frame of the matter and a low momentum @xmath0 may actually be moving faster relative to the outflowing matter than a higher momentum one . </S>",
    "<S> no conclusion can really be drawn without putting our results into a space - time model of the evolution of matter .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have studied the properties of the neutral @xmath0 meson in the gas of pions and nucleons with experimental and thermal momentum distributions . in the former case , </S>",
    "<S> pions give the dominant effect , in the latter case they are not important . </S>",
    "<S> this difference is due to completely different @xmath15 ratios . </S>",
    "<S> however , in both cases interaction with the gas provides a generally positive mass shift for the @xmath0 mesons and greatly increase their width . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 meson spectral density is so broadened that the @xmath0 may lose its identity as a well defined particle or resonance . at sufficiently high energy density </S>",
    "<S> the matter can no longer be described very well as a gas of noninteracting pions and nucleons . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless the trends must be obeyed by any realistic calculations of the @xmath0 meson in - medium . </S>",
    "<S> applications to thermal and hydrodynamic models of heavy ion collisions are under investigation . </S>"
