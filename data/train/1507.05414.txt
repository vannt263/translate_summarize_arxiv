    "graphene , a one - atom - thick layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice , has outstanding electrical  @xcite and mechanical  @xcite properties , as well as high optical transmittance  @xcite . for this reason , many electronic and photonic devices employing graphene , as either an active layer or a transparent electrode , have been demonstrated , such as light - emitting diodes ( leds )  @xcite , solar cells  @xcite , field - effect transistors  @xcite , photodetectors  @xcite , touch screens  @xcite , terahertz wave modulators  @xcite , and schottky junction devices  @xcite . in many such demonstrations ,",
    "a graphene layer has been deposited by transferring it onto a device substrate following the conventional wet - transfer method , where a graphene  polymer bilayer floating on a water bath is scooped by the substrate  @xcite .",
    "and when the patterning of graphene layers is required , it has mostly been performed after graphene transfer , typically using photolithography followed by reactive - ion etch ( rie )  @xcite .",
    "however , this method of obtaining patterned graphene layers  the wet - transfer and subsequent patterning process  has only a limited range of applications , where graphene layers must be deposited and patterned , when necessary , prior to deposition of any material that is too fragile to withstand a wet , high - temperature , or plasma process .",
    "notable , practically important examples of such materials are organic semiconductors  @xcite and organometal trihalide perovskite compounds  @xcite    attention , therefore , has been focused on development of dry - transfer techniques  @xcite . for example , a graphene layer grown on a cu layer on a donor substrate can be directly transferred onto a target substrate , by delaminating the graphene ",
    "cu interface when the target substrate in contact with the graphene layer is peeled off from the donor substrate  @xcite .",
    "however , for selective delamination , the target substrate needs to be coated with an epoxy adhesion layer , which makes this technique unsuitable for high - performance electronic devices : for example , it can not be applied to fabrication of an led with a top graphene electrode , since the adhesion layer in this case would be placed in the device interior , just beneath the graphene electrode , impeding efficient charge injection .",
    "another approach is to transfer - print a graphene layer coated with a ` self - release ' layer from an elastomeric stamp onto a target substrate  @xcite , where reliable transfer is achieved by choosing an appropriate self - release layer that assures the selective delamination at the interface between that and the elastomer .",
    "although the transfer process itself is dry , removing the self - release layer transferred along with the graphene is typically achieved with an organic solvent , ultimately limiting applications of this method .",
    "et al . _ demonstrated a technique capable of transferring graphene monolayers without an adhesion or a self - release layer  @xcite . in this mechano - electro - thermal process ,",
    "complete transfer , instead , requires application of high temperature ( @xmath1 ) and voltage ( @xmath1 ) while a graphene layer grown on cu foil is pressed onto a target substrate .        here , we demonstrate a low - temperature , dry transfer process capable of transfer - printing a patterned graphene monolayer onto a target substrate that can be damaged or degraded by a wet , plasma or high - temperature process . in this process",
    ", a graphene monolayer on cu foil , which is grown by chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) and then patterned using a conventional lithographic process , is transferred onto a stamp made of poly(dimethylsiloxane ) ( pdms ) , and subsequently transfer - printed from the stamp onto the target substrate . the graphene transfer from cu foil to pdms",
    "is achieved using the conventional wet - transfer process  @xcite , with the following two modifications : the use of au , instead of poly(methyl methacrylate ) ( pmma ) , as a material for the support layer , and the decrease in surface tension of the liquid bath using a water - ethanol mixture .",
    "these modifications are critical in preventing defect formation in a graphene monolayer during its transfer onto a pdms stamp , thereby leading to a minimum sheet resistance of for a graphene monolayer transfer - printed onto a glass substrate .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate transfer - printing of patterned graphene monolayers on poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate ( pedot : pss ) and moo@xmath0 , which are representative examples of organic electronic materials and practically important metal oxides  @xcite , respectively , that are usually damaged or degraded when exposed to aqueous or aggressive patterning processes .",
    "the morphological and elemental characterizations of the surfaces of transfer - printed graphene show the existence of contaminants that are likely to be siloxane oligomers transferred from the pdms stamp .",
    "we discuss the current range of application of this technique and possible means to expand it by eliminating the contamination problem .",
    "to transfer a graphene monolayer onto a target substrate that can be damaged or degraded by a wet or high - temperature process ( fig .",
    "[ fig : process_schematic ] ) , we first transfer a cvd - grown graphene onto a pdms stamp following the conventional wet - transfer method ( a to f ) : by scooping up , with the pdms stamp , a graphene  support bilayer floating on liquid .",
    "after the support layer is removed by chemical etching , the graphene is transfer - printed on a target substrate ( g to h ) .",
    "the first part of this process ( a to f ) , although seemingly similar to the conventional wet - transfer technique  @xcite , has two distinct features , which are crucial to obtain a high - quality graphene monolayer on a target substrate .",
    "first , as a support layer material , we use thermally deposited au , instead of pmma , which is mostly widely used for this purpose in the wet - transfer method  @xcite .",
    "pdms , the material chosen for a stamp owing to its mechanical and chemical properties suitable for various transfer - printing techniques  @xcite , swells when immersed in an organic solvent  @xcite that can dissolve the pmma support layer , such as acetone and chloroform . when this occurs , the graphene monolayer cracks , creating a large number of defects ( supplementary fig .",
    "s1 ) . on the contrary",
    ", the use of a au support layer allows one to obtain a high - quality graphene monolayer on pdms , since au can be removed using an aqueous etchant , which does not swell pdms .",
    "second , for the liquid on which the graphene  au bilayer floats and from which it is scooped with a pdms stamp [ fig .",
    "[ fig : process_schematic](d ) ] , we use an ethanol  water mixture , instead of water commonly used in the conventional wet - transfer technique .",
    "this is to decrease the surface tension of the liquid . in the conventional case , after the graphene  support bilayer is scooped with a hydrophilic substrate [ as in fig .",
    "[ fig : process_schematic](d ) ] , a thin layer of water is present throughout the graphene  substrate interface , providing sufficient lubrication at that interface . as a result ,",
    "when the sample is blow - dried using a n@xmath2 gun , the graphene and substrate form a conformal contact without wrinkles throughout the substrate , as the water is laterally displaced [ supplementary fig .",
    "s2(a ) ] . since the surface of a pdms stamp is hydrophobic , which is favorable for reliable transfer of a graphene monolayer onto a target substrate via stamping ( g to h in fig .",
    "[ fig : process_schematic ] ) , the use of water bath in fig .",
    "[ fig : process_schematic](d ) leads to a discontinuous lubrication layer between the bilayer and substrate , as schematically shown in supplementary fig .",
    ". therefore , blow - drying in this case results into bursting of trapped water droplets , tearing the graphene monolayer .",
    "this can be effectively prevented by using an ethanol ",
    "water mixture as the liquid bath , which sufficiently wets the pdms surface to provide a continuous lubrication layer [ supplementary fig .",
    "s2(c ) ] .",
    "when patterning of graphene is required , a conventional patterning process , such as o@xmath2 rie of graphene using photoresist patterned by photolithography as an etch mask  @xcite , is performed before step ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : process_schematic ] .",
    "then , performing the remaining processes [ step ( b ) to ( h ) ] , one can obtain a patterned graphene monolayer on a target substrate .",
    "this pre - transfer patterning of graphene allows one to avoid possible damage to the fragile material that is likely to occur , when a process such as photolithography  @xcite , rie  @xcite , or laser ablation  @xcite is performed after the graphene is transferred to the target substrate .",
    "to show that the surface tension of a liquid used in step ( d ) in fig .  [ fig : process_schematic ] is a critical factor determining the quality of transfer - printed graphene , we transfer - printed a graphene monolayer on a si substrate coated with a 285-nm - thick sio@xmath2 layer following a process described in fig .",
    "[ fig : process_schematic ] , while varying the liquid bath : in one set of experiments , we used water , and in the other , a water  ethanol mixture ( water and ethanol by volume ) .",
    "when water bath was used , although the entire graphene sheet ( by ) was seemingly well - transferred , a closer observation revealed that there are randomly distributed irregular - shaped holes where graphene is absent , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : water_vs_mixture](a ) .",
    "the density of these defects is approximately . when the pdms stamp was observed by an optical microscope after step ( f ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : process_schematic ] , it was found that similar defects , albeit smaller in size , were present ( supplementary fig .",
    "s3 ) , indicating that the defects are formed while transferring the graphene layer onto the pdms surface and are exacerbated during the transfer - printing onto the substrate .",
    "as described in the previous section , the defects arise from insufficient wetting of the pdms surface by water . since pdms is hydrophobic , immediately after a graphene",
    " au bilayer is scooped by a pdms stamp , water dewets the pdms surface in several locations , making the bilayer form contacts to the pdms surface that is only locally conformal [ supplementary figs .",
    "s2(b ) and s4(a ) ] . as the sample is blow - dried using a n@xmath2 gun , these locally conformal contacts laterally expand , generating narrow wrinkles with water droplets trapped inside , as shown in the right image of supplementary fig .",
    "we speculate that further application of n@xmath2 pressure causes the water droplets to burst , resulting into defects such as that shown in supplementary fig .",
    "in fact , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : water_vs_mixture](a ) , the locations of many defects in the graphene transferred onto the substrate seem to coincide with the intersection of the wrinkles , where relatively large water droplets are expected to form : the linear regions in fig .  [",
    "fig : water_vs_mixture](a ) indicated by the white arrow are where the graphene monolayer is folded , which results from the wrinkles in the graphene  au bilayer .",
    "in contrast , when the ethanol ",
    "water mixture was used , its lower surface tension ( @xmath3 at  @xcite allows a continuous lubrication layer to form between the graphene and pdms surfaces , providing effective `` decoupling '' of the bilayer from the pdms surface .",
    "therefore , no wrinkles , except a few with much smaller heights , were observed in the graphene  au bilayer on the pdms stamp [ supplementary fig .",
    "s4(b ) ] . we found that mild baking at removes these wrinkles , resulting into the flat graphene  au bilayer that is globally conformal to the pdms stamp , and consequently , successful transfer - printing of the graphene monolayer was achieved without defects , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : water_vs_mixture](b ) .",
    "the sheet resistance ( @xmath4 ) was measured for graphene monolayers transfer - printed on glass substrates , using the van der pauw method  @xcite .",
    "the size of the graphene monolayers are approximately by . in the following , a graphene monolayer transfer - printed onto a final substrate from a pdms stamp onto which a graphene  au bilayer was scooped from a bath of water and the ethanol ",
    "water mixture are referred to as @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively . for @xmath5 ,",
    "the sheet resistance , averaged over five samples ( @xmath7 ) is , with a minimum equal to . in contrast , for @xmath6 , @xmath7 is , with a minimum being .",
    "figure  [ fig : water_vs_mixture](c ) shows raman spectra of graphene monolayers shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : water_vs_mixture](a ) and ( b ) , where for @xmath5 they were obtained from defect - free regions .",
    "the spectra show that , for both cases , ( i ) each raman peak occurs at the same location ( d : , 2d : , g : ) , ( ii ) the height of the d peaks is negligible , and ( iii ) the 2d / g peak ratios are larger than 2.7 , confirming that the transfer - printed graphene is indeed a monolayer  @xcite .",
    "this result indicates that significantly larger values of @xmath4 for @xmath5 , in comparison to that for @xmath6 , are due not to the properties of graphene in defect - free regions , but to large - scale defects as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : water_vs_mixture](a ) , which has been prevented by decreasing the surface tension in the case of @xmath6 .    figure  [ fig : water_vs_mixture](d ) shows the optical transmission spectra of @xmath5 and @xmath6 transfer - printed on a 0.7-mm - thick glass substrate , averaged over five samples for each case .",
    "transmittance ( @xmath8 ) , plotted on the @xmath9-axis , is the intensity of the optical beam transmitted through a glass / graphene sample normalized to that transmitted through a glass substrate .",
    "the size of the optical beam at the sample location was approximately by . for both @xmath5 and @xmath6 ,",
    "the values of @xmath8 are consistent with what was previously measured for a graphene monolayer on a quartz substrate  @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath8 for @xmath5 is slightly higher than that for @xmath6 , primarily because the absence of graphene in the defects in @xmath5 allow more light to be transmitted . under this hypothesis ,",
    "the ratio of total area of the defects to the entire area of the graphene sheet ( @xmath10 ) , can be estimated as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are transmittance of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath10 calculated at each wavelength in fig .",
    "[ fig : water_vs_mixture](d ) ranges from to , which is consistent with our estimation based on optical microscope images .",
    "as expected , successful transfer - printing of graphene requires a defect - free graphene monolayer that is globally conformal to a pdms stamp .",
    "our proposed technique achieves this with the water  ethanol mixture , which provides a continuous lubrication layer , and with an au support layer , which allows for its removal without swelling pdms .",
    "alternatively , one may attempt to obtain a defect - free graphene monolayer on a pdms stamp by pressing the stamp onto a graphene layer grown on cu foil and then etching away the cu foil by floating the cu / graphene / pdms on a bath of a cu etchant .",
    "since the surface of cu foil commonly used in cvd growth of graphene typically has corrugations on the micron scale  @xcite , the pdms attached to the graphene in this case is in contact with the graphene only partially . as a result ,",
    "subsequent processes such as n@xmath2 blow - dry and transfer - printing tend to cause defects in the graphene layer , as shown in supplementary fig .",
    "in fact , it was previously reported that @xmath4 of a transfer - printed graphene monolayer by this approach was , even with a self - release layer inserted for reliable graphene transfer  @xcite .        to fabricate practical electronic devices where graphene is used as active layers or electrodes , the patterning of graphene is required .",
    "our technique , described in fig .",
    "[ fig : process_schematic ] , can achieve this with a simple modification : the process begins with a patterned graphene on cu foil in step ( a ) , instead of an unpatterned graphene layer . in our current demonstration , we first prepared a patterned graphene monolayer on cu foil by etching unpatterned graphene grown on cu foil by o@xmath2 rie using a photoresist etch mask patterned by photolithography .",
    "next , the patterned graphene was transfer - printed on a si / sio@xmath2 substrate coated with moo@xmath0 or pedot : pss , both of which are susceptible to degradation when exposed to an aqueous condition or aggressive patterning process",
    ". figures  [ fig : patterning](a ) and ( b ) are optical micrographs of the substrates , where patterned graphene monolayers were transfer - printed in regions indicated by the arrows , showing that the patterns defined on photomasks were replicated in the transfer - printed graphene monolayers .",
    "the widths of the smallest features  lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : patterning](a ) and arcs in fig .",
    "[ fig : patterning](b )  are and , respectively , which are identical , within the resolution of the optical imaging system used ( @xmath14 ) , to those of the corresponding features on the photomask .",
    "a closer observation of the pattern edge using a field emission scanning electron microscope ( fe - sem ) revealed that it is not straight on the nanoscale , with an `` edge resolution '' of , which is probably attributed to the edge resolution of the photomask patterns and/or limitation of the photolithography process ( supplementary fig .",
    "s7 ) . from this , together with the fact that previously demonstrated transfer - printing - based patterning techniques can create patterns whose size is well below 100  nm  @xcite , we expect that our technique is capable of creating sub - micrometer graphene patterns , if a nanopatterning process , for example electron - beam  @xcite , nanoimprint  @xcite , or nanosphere  @xcite lithography , is employed , instead of photolithography .",
    "raman spectra obtained from the graphene transfer - printed on the moo@xmath0 show the distinct g and 2d peaks , with the 2d / g intensity ratio of 2.5 , and the negligible d peak , suggesting that the quality of the graphene is comparable to that in fig .",
    "[ fig : water_vs_mixture](b ) . for the case of the graphene",
    "transfer - printed onto the pedot : pss , the peaks associated with graphene , except the 2d peak , can not be identified due to the overlap with raman spectra of pedot : pss .",
    "next , we observed the surface of the transfer - printed graphene on a si / sio@xmath2 substrate , using a fe - sem and an atomic force microscope ( afm ) .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sem_afm](a ) , irregularly shaped dark patches , as enclosed by a white circle , are randomly distributed throughout the surface .",
    "also shown are the dark lines , as marked by the white arrow .",
    "these two features , patches and lines , are commonly found in the transferred graphene cvd - grown on cu foil  with the former and latter attributed to graphene multilayers and wrinkles , respectively  @xcite  and hence are not caused by our transfer technique .",
    "it is also shown that in the patches , there are darker spots with diameters of approximately .        the surface profile measured using an afm along the white dotted line in fig .  [",
    "fig : sem_afm](c ) shows that the spots have heights as high as approximately [ fig .",
    "[ fig : sem_afm](d ) ] . to identify the origin of the dark spots ,",
    "elemental analysis was carried out using a scanning transmission electron microscope capable of energy dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( stem - eds ) . in order to prepare a sample for this analysis , a graphene layer was transfer - printed from a pdms stamp onto a si / sio@xmath2 substrate coated with a pedot : pss separation layer , and then transferred onto a lacey carbon tem grid using the conventional wet - transfer method ( see the method section for the experimental detail ) .",
    "an eds spectrum obtained from a region shown in supplementary fig .",
    "s8(a ) shows that , in addition to carbon , silicon atoms are present on the graphene surface [ supplementary fig .",
    "given many previous reports showing that uncured siloxane oligomers were present on pdms surfaces  @xcite , it is highly likely that the dark spots on the graphene surface are siloxane residues that have been transferred from the pdms stamp .",
    "this speculation was further supported by the fact that the dark spots can be eliminated by annealing the sample at under h@xmath2 and ar , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sem_afm](b )  @xcite . the afm measurements [ fig .  [ fig : sem_afm](c ) and ( d ) ] show that the surface in the background , that is , regions away from the patches and lines , is much rougher than that of a clean graphene surface  @xcite , suggesting that the oligomer residues are also present throughout the surface , not only on the multilayer regions .",
    "the morphological and elemental characterizations of the surface of transfer - printed graphene discussed above help determine the range of application of our technique in its current form .",
    "since the oligomer residues are likely to be present only on the top surface , that is , the graphene surface that used to be in contact with the pdms , our technique can be applied to fabrication of ( i ) devices where only the bottom surface of the graphene electrode is involved in injection or collection of charge carriers , such as leds and solar cells , made of organic semiconductors  @xcite or organometal trihalide perovskite compounds  @xcite , with top graphene electrodes , and ( ii ) devices whose graphene electrodes are used to establish electric fields without charge carrier transport , such as thin - film transistors with graphene gate electrodes  @xcite and terahertz wave modulators  @xcite . meanwhile , when charge carrier injection or collection occurs in both sides of the graphene layer , such as in tandem leds and solar cells where it is part of the interlayers , our technique is not applicable .",
    "therefore , expanding the range of application of our technique by eliminating the oligomer contamination , possibly with the following modification , is important future work : replacing pdms with other stamp material that can be completely cured ; or depositing a blocking layer on the pdms surface to prevent possible transfer of uncured oligomers onto the graphene surface , with a potential candidate being a pressure sensitive adhesive layer  @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have developed a low temperature , dry process capable of transfer - printing a patterned graphene monolayer grown on cu foil on a target substrate .",
    "two features distinct from the conventional wet - transfer method  @xcite  the use of a support layer composed of au , instead of pmma , and the decrease in surface tension of the liquid bath on which a graphene  au bilayer floats  allow one to obtain a graphene monolayer on a pdms stamp without defects that would otherwise arise . subsequently , the graphene is transfer - printed from the stamp onto a target substrate .",
    "the characteristics of a graphene monolayer transfer - printed using our technique are comparable to those obtained with the conventional wet - transfer method , with a sheet resistance as low as and optical transmittance of at . in addition , with pre - transfer patterning of graphene on cu foil using conventional patterning processes , our technique is capable of creating graphene monolayer patterns on materials that are easily degraded when exposed to high - temperature processes , organic solvents , or aqueous chemicals . as an example , using photolithography followed by reactive - ion etch to pattern graphene monolayers on cu foil and then transfer - printing them , we have obtained graphene monolayer patterns on moo@xmath0 and pedot : pss , with the smallest feature size and edge resolution of @xmath3 and , respectively . immediate application areas of this technique include organic electronic devices whose top electrodes are composed of graphene .",
    "moreover , by eliminating siloxane oligomer residues on graphene using alternate stamp material , the technique can be further applied to devices whose graphene electrodes are in their interiors , such as tandem leds and solar cells .",
    "finally , with possible appropriate modification , it may also be applied to dry - transfer of other two - dimensional materials , including boron nitride  @xcite and molybdenum disulfide  @xcite .",

    "<S> graphene has recently attracted much interest as a material for flexible , transparent electrodes or active layers in electronic and photonic devices . however , realization of such graphene - based devices is limited due to difficulties in obtaining patterned graphene monolayers on top of materials that are degraded when exposed to a high - temperature or wet process . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate a low - temperature , dry process capable of transfer - printing a patterned graphene monolayer grown on cu foil onto a target substrate using an elastomeric stamp . </S>",
    "<S> a challenge in realizing this is to obtain a high - quality graphene layer on a hydrophobic stamp made of poly(dimethylsiloxane ) , which is overcome by introducing two crucial modifications to the conventional wet - transfer method  the use of a support layer composed of au and the decrease in surface tension of the liquid bath . using this technique , patterns of a graphene monolayer </S>",
