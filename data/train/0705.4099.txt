    "in this paper we study the nematic to isotropic quantum phase transition ( qpt ) , deep within the d - wave superconducting phase of a quasi two dimensional tetragonal crystal .",
    "the `` nematic '' refers to a broken symmetry phase in which the four - fold rotational symmetry of the crystal is broken down to a two - fold symmetry .",
    "more specifically , it is an `` ising nematic , '' which spontaneously breaks the discrete rotational symmetry of the tetragonal crystal to an orthorhombic subgroup , @xmath1 , while retaining translational symmetry .",
    "the superconducting order opens a gap in the quasiparticle excitation spectrum , except at four gapless nodal points , but these nodal quasiparticles ( qp s ) couple strongly to the nematic order parameter fluctuations . in the nematic phase",
    ", these nodes are displaced from the relevant symmetry directions by an amount proportional to the nematic order parameter , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd ] we derive a phenomenological theory to describe this `` nodal nematic qpt '' consisting of a nematic mode coupled to the nodal qp s of the d - wave superconductor .    our motivation to investigate this problem is two - fold : firstly",
    ", there is , now , considerable experimental evidence that a nodal nematic phase occurs in at least some `` underdoped '' cuprate superconductors , so this study has potential relevance to the transition from this state to the isotropic state in these materials .",
    "the best evidence of this comes from measurements@xcite of strongly temperature dependent transport anisotropies in underdoped yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 , and more recent ( and more direct ) neutron scattering experiments in underdoped yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath5 ( ybco)@xcite . specifically , the spontaneous onset of one - dimensional incommensurate spin modulations in the neutron experiments is clear evidence of an isotropic - to - nematic transition with transition temperature @xmath6 . for @xmath7 ,",
    "@xmath8 is greater than the superconducting @xmath9 .",
    "however at higher o concentration , @xmath10 , both the neutron scattering and transport experiments see no evidence of a transition to a nematic phase down to the lowest temperatures@xcite .",
    "it is thus reasonable to assume that @xmath11 for a critical value , @xmath12 , with a qpt at @xmath13 inside the sc phase . @xcite .",
    "the extent to which nematic phases are generic to the cuprates is a question that is beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "however , matsuda and coworkers@xcite have recently reported that the `` fluctuating stripe '' phase of underdoped ( with @xmath14 ) is actually a ( diagonal ) nematic phase .",
    "moreover , stm studies@xcite have revealed a glassy phase with nematic domains in underdoped bi@xmath2sr@xmath2cacu@xmath2o@xmath15 .    , separating the nodal nematic phase for @xmath16 from the symmetric phase , and its quantum critical fan . @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the superconducting and nematic critical temperatures and the ( purple ) wedge corresponds to the thermal critical regime . ]    secondly , the topic of quantum critical points ( qcp ) in 2d systems with itinerant fermions has been and continues to be a topic of broad interest . here",
    "we study a new qcp in a 2d itinerant fermion system .",
    "in general , the presence of gapless fermions at the fermi surface makes the study of this topic theoretically challenging .",
    "since gapless fermions interact with massless bosons associated with order parameter fluctuations , this interaction affects both low energy degrees of freedom , making it difficult to obtain a correct description of the critical physics .",
    "simplifications occur when one considers nodal fermions which are gapless only at four nodal points of the underlying fermi surface in a d - wave superconductor .",
    "the limited phase space for the gapless fermions restricts the possibilities for scattering mechanisms permitting a controlled analysis .",
    "electronic nematic phases were first predicted to occur in doped mott insulators@xcite , and have now been experimentally observed in a number of different systems .",
    "in addition to ybco , they have been discovered in transport experiments in semiconductor heterostructures@xcite and in the bulk transition metal oxide sr@xmath3ru@xmath2o@xmath19@xcite .",
    "while in all cases the thermal transition to the nematic phase appears to be continuous , the character of the quantum transition at zero temperature is less clear , and at least in the case of sr@xmath3ru@xmath2o@xmath19@xcite appears to be first order .",
    "however , interesting universal physics can be expected in the case of a continuous transition .",
    "vojta , zhang and sachdev @xcite analyzed various types of ordering transitions in a nodal superconductor , including ising nematic ordering .",
    "they employed an @xmath20 expansion ( @xmath21 ) to derive a perturbative renormalization group ( rg ) flows near the decoupled fixed point , @xmath22 . in the nematic case , they found runaway flows which they tentatively interpreted as a fluctuation induced first order transition .",
    "of course , a runaway flow can also imply a breakdown of perturbation theory .",
    "in this paper we work directly in @xmath23 , and use a large @xmath24 theory to access a non - trivial critical point at finite coupling @xmath25 .",
    "this is achieved by generalizing the problem to one in which there are @xmath24 `` flavors '' of nodal qp s ( with the physical @xmath26 case corresponding to two spin polarizations)@xcite . in the large @xmath24 limit , we present a theory of the nodal nematic qpt@xcite , whose critical behavior should be smoothly and systematically corrected by the @xmath0 expansion@xcite .",
    "we find : a ) the quantum phase transition is continuous , with non - trivial critical exponents that we compute for @xmath27 , b ) the transition occurs at a _ finite _ critical coupling between the nodal qp s and the nematic order parameter , so is inaccessible by perturbation theory , c ) the anisotropy of the nodal qp dispersion strongly influences the interplay between the critical fluctuations and the qp s .",
    "we also speculate on the implications of this theory to the phenomenology of nodal qp s in cuprates . with minor changes",

    ". it also produces an edc with a ` peak - dip - hump ' .",
    "the existence of _ entirely _ undamped quasiparticles inside sharply defined @xmath191-space wedges is likely an artifact of the first order corrections in the @xmath0 expansion , since higher orders terms are likely to introduce finite damping .",
    "it is therefore more plausible that the wedge delineates a crossover from a regime in which the qp s are highly damped , to a regime inside the wedge in which the qp peaks are relatively narrow with a width that vanishes as one approaches the tangential direction along the fs .",
    "consider now the nodal nematic phase away from criticality , @xmath192 , where the nematic order parameter has a non - zero expectation value , as in eq .. because of the ising character of the ordered state , there is a gap in the nodal nematic fluctuation spectrum , @xmath193 . at energies large compared to @xmath194 ,",
    "the spectral function is little different from its behavior at criticality .",
    "however , at energies small compared to @xmath194 , the nodal qp s are undamped , but the nodal positions are shifted from the symmetric points in @xmath191-space by an amount @xmath195 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd ] , and the velocity tangential to the fermi surface is renormalized , as in eq ..    unfortunately , quenched disorder ( impurities ) has a devastating effect on nematic phases , and indeed macroscopic manifestations of electron nematic order have only been seen in ultra - pure systems  @xcite .",
    "specifically , the order parameter theory in the presence of impurities is equivalent to the random - field ising model@xcite , and hence nematic systems are more generally expected to exhibit glassy dynamics rather than a broken symmetry.@xcite thus , more detailed spectroscopies and/or local measurements play an especially central role in experimental studies of nematic phases . here",
    "we sketch the effects of disorder on the single - particle spectral function in the nematic phases .",
    "we consider two extremal cases : short range and mesoscopic range disorder .",
    "short range disorder produces an imaginary part to the self - energy , which smears the mdc at @xmath196 in _ all directions _ about the nodal point . due to the intrinsic dispersion anisotropy",
    ", this broadened weight is severely elongated along the tangential direction so the resulting mdc has a shape that resembles a fermi `` arc . ''",
    "however the width of the mdc in the normal direction is still proportional to the arc length .    in sufficiently clean systems ,",
    "the effects of disorder are only significant on longer distances , producing a `` nematic glass '' . here",
    "we focus on the static effects leaving out ( important ) dynamical effects generally expected in glassy phases , such as hysteresis and noise .",
    "if each domain is large enough to support a defined local nematic order , the variance @xmath197 among domains amounts to a distribution of nodal positions along the fs .",
    "in such a mesoscale glass phase , a local measurement ( such as stm ) will see sharply defined nodal quasiparticles at low enough energy , but a measurement , such as arpes , which averages over a large area , will measure the domain averaged spectral function @xmath198 where @xmath199 is the probability density that @xmath46 which shifts the position of the node by @xmath200 , and @xmath201 is the spectral function for free qp s @xmath202\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] with @xmath90 given in eq .  . for a gaussian distribution of @xmath46 with variance @xmath203 , @xmath204 and it is straight forward to show that the average spectral function in eq . becomes @xmath205 \\label{eq : glassa}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] note that this defines a fermi arc of length @xmath206 with a vanishing perpendicular width , along the fs ( @xmath207 ) at zero energy @xmath196 .",
    "in this paper we have presented a phenomenological theory of the nodal nematic qpt .",
    "formally similar problems arise in studies of the nodal quasiparticles near other qpts.@xcite in all these cases , the ordered phase preserves the @xmath54 symmetry , and the velocity anisotropy is irrelevant so the fixed point is isotropic with emergent lorenz invariance . in the case of a nodal nematic critical point ,",
    "the dispersion anisotropy is enhanced at criticality .",
    "this has unforeseen effects on the single - particle spectral function .",
    "we conclude with a few observations on the possible relevance of a nodal nematic quantum criticality to the cuprate physics , recognizing the danger of extrapolating large @xmath24 results down to @xmath26@xcite .",
    "the previously cited evidence of a nematic phase yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath208 near @xmath209 from@xcite transport anisotropy measurements and from inelastic neutron scattering in untwined samples@xcite , involves studies of materials with unusual purity and crystalline perfection .",
    "nematic order couples linearly to spatial inhomogeneity and disorder , which thus generically causes the ordered phase to be replaced by a glassy ( domain ) phase .",
    "a glassy phase with anisotropic domains has been seen in stm studies of underdoped bi@xmath2sr@xmath2cacu@xmath2o@xmath15@xcite .",
    "it is tempting to identify these structures , and the `` fermi arcs '' seen in arpes experiments on the same material@xcite , with the nematic glass .",
    "however , this interpretation requires an extrapolation from the phase with strong sc order where the theory is valid to the non - superconducting pseudogap regime where the experiment is carried out .",
    "moreover , this interpretation is far from unique.@xcite a critical test of this interpretation is that as the disorder is made increasingly weak , there will be a crossover from a short range disorder behavior with a nodal point that is broadened in all direction , to a nematic glass regime with a longer @xmath210 arc length but a narrower width ( with eq . as the limiting case ) .",
    "the existence of a nodal nematic phase@xcite , related to ordered or fluctuating stripes , is moderately clear@xcite in la@xmath211sr@xmath212cuo@xmath213 and related materials near @xmath214 , but it seems likely that the critical phenomena in this system will be considerably affected by quenched disorder .    the structure of the single particle spectral function at the nodal nematic qcp shown in fig.[fig : mdc ] with sharp qp s within a narrow wedge around the fs but otherwise broad , may provide a consistent explanation for both the observation of broad qp s in arpes@xcite and of sharp qp interference peaks in stm@xcite@xcite on .",
    "since the wedge is so narrow due to the extreme dispersion anisotropy , it is unlikely to be observed in a direct momentum space probe .",
    "hence in arpes , one is likely to only observe broad qp s .",
    "however the interpretation of peaks in the fourier transform of stm on  in terms of qp interference invoke the notion of coherent qp s at the tips of the equal energy ellipses ( or `` banana ' 's as it is frequently referred to ) along the fs@xcite .",
    "the narrow wedge provides a natural and possibly unique mechanism for this interpretation .",
    "this aspect will be further analyzed in a future publication@xcite .",
