    "motivated by works on lifshitz scaling in condensed matter physics , it is possible to take different lifshitz scaling for space and time , and the resultant theory is called horava - lifshitz gravity @xcite . in the ir limit",
    "this gravity reduces to general relativity , and so it can be considered as a uv completion of general relativity . motivated by this work on horava - lifshitz gravity , different lifshitz scaling for space and time have been considered for type iia string theory @xcite , type iib string theory @xcite , ads / cft correspondence @xcite , dilatonic black branes @xcite , and dilatonic black holes @xcite . another uv completion theory of general relativity which reduces to general relativity in the ir limit is called gravity s rainbow @xcite .",
    "in fact , it has been demonstrated that gravity s rainbow is related to horava - lifshitz gravity @xcite .",
    "this is because both of these theories are based on the modifying the usual energy - momentum dispersion relation in the uv limit such that it reduces to the usual energy - momentum dispersion relation in the ir limit .",
    "it may be noted that such modification of the usual energy - momentum has also been obtained in discrete spacetime @xcite , spacetime foam @xcite , spin - network in loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) @xcite , ghost condensation @xcite and non - commutative geometry @xcite .",
    "the non - commutative geometry occurs due to background fluxes in string theory @xcite , and is used to derive one of the most important rainbow functions in gravity s rainbow @xcite .",
    "it may be noted that the uv modification of the usual energy - momentum relation implies the breaking of the lorentz symmetry in the uv limit of the theory .",
    "the spontaneous breaking of the lorentz symmetry can occur in string theory because of the existence of an unstable perturbative string vacuum @xcite .",
    "it is possible for a tachyon field to have wrong sign for its mass squared in string field theory , and this causes the perturbative string vacuum to become unstable .",
    "the theory becomes ill - defined if the vacuum expectation value of the tachyon field is infinite .",
    "it is also possible for the vacuum expectation value of the tachyon field to be finite and negative . in this case , the coefficient of the quadratic term for the massless vector field is nonzero and negative , and this breaks the lorentz symmetry .",
    "the spontaneous breaking of the lorentz symmetry in string theory has also been investigated using the gravitational version of the higgs mechanism @xcite .",
    "this has been done for the low energy effective action obtained from string theory .",
    "the lorentz symmetry breaking has been also studied using black brane in type iib string theory @xcite . in this analysis ,",
    "moduli stabilization was studied using a kklt - type moduli potential in the context of type iib warped flux compactification .",
    "it was demonstrated that a higgs phase for gravity will exist if all moduli are stabilized .",
    "another study regarding the breaking of lorentz symmetry was done by using compactification in string field theory @xcite .",
    "it may be noted that various other approaches to quantum gravity also indicate that the lorentz symmetry might only be an effective symmetry which occurs in the ir limit of some fundamental theories of quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "hence , there is a good motivation to study the uv deformation of geometries that occur in string theory .",
    "in fact , motivated by lifshitz deformation of such geometries , and the relation between horava - lifshitz gravity and gravity s rainbow @xcite , recently rainbow deformation of geometries that occur in string theory has been performed .",
    "thus , the modifications of the thermodynamics of black rings has been analyzed using gravity s rainbow @xcite .",
    "it has been observed that a remnant exists for black rings in gravity s rainbow .",
    "it has also been argued that a remnant might exist for all black objects in gravity s rainbow @xcite .",
    "this has been explicitly demonstrated for kerr black holes , kerr - newman black holes in de sitter space , charged ads black holes , higher dimensional kerr - ads black holes and black saturn @xcite .",
    "this was done by generalizing the work done on the thermodynamics of black holes in gravity s rainbow @xcite . as the usual uncertainty principle still holds in gravity s rainbow @xcite , and it is possible to obtain a lower bound on the energy @xmath0 , using the usual uncertainty principle .",
    "this energy can be related to the energy of a particle emitted in hawking radiation .",
    "furthermore , the value of the uncertainty in position can be equated to the radius of the event horizon , @xmath1 this energy can be related to the energy at which spacetime is probed , and hence it describes the energy @xmath2 in gravity s rainbow .",
    "this is because effectively this particle emitted with the energy @xmath2 can be viewed as a probe which is probing the geometry of the black hole .",
    "this consideration modifies the temperature of the black hole @xcite .",
    "the entropy and heat capacity of black hole in gravity s rainbow can be calculated using this modified temperature .",
    "an interesting consequence of this modified solution is that it predicts the existence of remnants for the black hole .",
    "thus , the temperature of the black hole reduces to zero , when black hole has a small but finite size . at this size",
    ", the black hole does not emit any hawking radiation .",
    "the existence of black hole remnants can be used as a solution for the information paradox @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it also solves problem related to the existence of naked singularity at the last stage of the evaporation of a black hole . as in this picture ,",
    "a black hole does not evaporate completely producing a naked singularity , but rather a remnant is produced at the last stage of the evaporation of the black hole .",
    "the existence of a remnant also has phenomenological consequences .",
    "this is because it is not possible to produce black holes smaller than these remnants .",
    "this increases the energy at which mini black holes can be produced at the lhc @xcite .",
    "recently , a lot of interest has been generated in gravity s rainbow @xcite .",
    "it may be noted that the rainbow functions have been constrained from experimental data @xcite .",
    "black hole solutions in gravity s rainbow with nonlinear sources have been investigated in @xcite .",
    "in addition , the hydrostatic equilibrium equation for this gravity was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite .    as there is a strong motivation to study rainbow deformation of geometries that occur in string theory , so we analyze the rainbow deformation of charged dilatonic black holes in this paper . it may be noted that dilaton gravity arises as a low - energy effective field theory of string theory @xcite .",
    "the dilaton field is also a candidate for dark matter @xcite .",
    "in fact , in order to have better picture of nature of the dark energy , a new scalar field is added to the field content of the original theory @xcite .",
    "black objects in presence of dilaton gravity , have also been investigated @xcite .",
    "recently , dilaton field has been used for analyzing compact objects and hydrostatic equilibrium of starts @xcite .",
    "the evaporation of quantum black holes has also been investigated using two dimensional dilaton gravity @xcite .",
    "motivated by these applications , we analyze dilaton field using the formalism of gravity s rainbow .",
    "thermodynamical aspects of black holes have been of a great interest ever since of pioneering works of hawking and beckenstein @xcite . the idea that geometrical aspects of black holes could be interpreted as thermodynamical quantities provides a deep insight into the connection between gravity and quantum mechanics .",
    "on the other hand , introduction and developments in gauge / gravity duality highlighted the importance of black holes thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "in addition , hawking and page showed the existence of a phase transition for asymptotically anti de - sitter black holes @xcite .",
    "this phase transition was reconsidered through the use of ads / cft correspondence by witten @xcite .",
    "these works motivated a large number of researches to be conducted in context of black holes thermodynamics , stability and their phase transitions @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been demonstrated that , it is possible to treat the cosmological constant as the thermodynamic pressure in extended phase space .",
    "there are several reasons for such consideration which among them one can point out the existence of second order phase transition for black holes , van der waals like liquid / gas behavior in phase diagrams and formation of the triple point @xcite .",
    "the consideration of the cosmological constant as a thermodynamical variable could be supported by studies that are conducted in context of ads / cft @xcite .",
    "in addition , it was shown that a case of ensemble dependency exists for charged @xmath3-dimensional black holes which could be removed by considering cosmological constant as a thermodynamical variable @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamical critical behavior of black holes in presence of different matter fields and gravities has been investigated in literature @xcite another interesting method of studying thermodynamical structure of the black holes is through the use of geometry .",
    "it is proposed that one can build a phase space of the black holes by employing one of thermodynamical quantities of the black holes as thermodynamical potential and its corresponding extensive parameters as components of the phase space .",
    "the information regarding phase transitions of the black holes is within the singularities of ricci scalar of the constructed phase space . in other words , the divergencies of the ricci scalar of thermodynamical metric",
    "are representing bound and phase transition points .",
    "the thermodynamical potential for this method could be mass which is used in weinhold @xcite , quevedo @xcite and hpem @xcite metrics or entropy which is employed in ruppeiner @xcite metric .",
    "it was pointed out that ruppeiner and weinhold methods are related to each other with temperature as conformal factor @xcite .",
    "it was shown that for specific cases of black holes , weinhold , ruppeiner and quevedo metrics may fail to provide consistent results regarding phase transitions while the hpem metric is proven to be successful one @xcite . in what follows ,",
    "we use all of these methods to study phase transitions of the black holes .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we obtain the charged black hole solutions in dilaton gravity s rainbow and analyze their properties .",
    "this will be done by making the metric of charged black hole solutions in dilaton gravity depends on the energy .",
    "we also examine the first law of thermodynamics for this solution .",
    "next , we study the stability of such solutions in gravity s rainbow and phase transition of these black holes through heat capacity , geometrical thermodynamics and the analogy between cosmological constant and thermodynamical pressure .",
    "finally , we obtain critical pressure and horizon radius through another method .",
    "last section is devoted to conclusion .",
    "in this section , we obtain charged black hole solutions in dilaton gravity s rainbow and investigate their properties . this will be done by writing an energy dependent version of the metric for dilaton - maxwell gravity . it may be noted that gravity s rainbow is based on the generalization of doubly special relativity @xcite , and so it is not possible for a particle to attain energy greater than the planck energy in gravity s rainbow .",
    "this is because gravity affects particles of different energies differently , and so the spacetime is represented by a family of energy dependent metrics in gravity s rainbow @xcite .",
    "the gravity s rainbow can be constructed by considering the following deformation of the standard energy - momentum relation @xmath4 where energy ratio is @xmath5 , in which @xmath2 and @xmath6 are , respectively , the energy of test particle and the planck energy . the functions @xmath7 and @xmath8 are required to be constrained in such a way that the standard energy - momentum relation is obtained in the infrared limit .",
    "thus , we require @xmath9    it may be noted that the spacetime is probed at the energy @xmath2 , and by definition this can not be greater than the planck energy . @xmath10 and @xmath11 are called the rainbow functions and their functional forms are phenomenologically motivated .",
    "now it is possible to define an energy dependent deformation of the metric @xmath12 as @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 here @xmath15 and @xmath16 refer to the energy independent frame fields .",
    "the @xmath17-dimensional action of charged dilaton gravity is @xcite @xmath18 ,   \\label{action}\\]]where @xmath19 is the ricci scalar curvature , @xmath20 is the dilaton field and @xmath21 is a potential for @xmath20 .",
    "the electromagnetic field is @xmath22 in which @xmath23 is the electromagnetic potential .",
    "in addition , it should be pointed out that @xmath24 is a constant which determines the strength of coupling of the scalar and electromagnetic field . due to the fact that we are looking for the black hole with a radial electric field ( @xmath25 )",
    ", the electromagnetic potential will be in the following form @xmath26    using variational principle and varying eq .",
    "( [ action ] ) with respect to the gravitational field @xmath27 , the dilaton field @xmath20 and the gauge field @xmath23 , we can obtain the following field equations @xmath28@xmath29@xmath30    in this paper we are attempting to obtain dilaton - maxwell rainbow solutions .",
    "to do so , one can employ following static metric ansatz @xmath31 , \\label{metric}\\]]where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are radial dependent functions which should be determined , and @xmath34 represents the line element of a @xmath35 dimensional hypersurface with the constant curvature @xmath36 and volume @xmath37 .",
    "we should note that the constant @xmath38 indicates that the boundary of @xmath39 and @xmath40 can be a positive ( elliptic ) , zero ( flat ) or negative ( hyperbolic ) , constant curvature hypersurface with following explicit forms @xmath41    using eq .",
    "( [ maxwell equation ] ) , one can obtain electromagnetic tensor as @xmath42where @xmath43 is an integration constant which is related to the electric charge of the black hole .    here",
    ", in order to find consistent metric functions , we use a modified version of liouville - type dilation potential with following form @xmath44where @xmath45 and @xmath46 is a free parameter which plays the role of the cosmological constant .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that for the case of @xmath47 , one obtains @xmath48which is the usual liouville - type dilation potential that is used in the context of friedman - robertson - walker scalar field cosmologies @xcite and einstein - maxwell - dilaton black holes @xcite .",
    "next , we employ an ansatz , @xmath49 , in the field equations .",
    "the motivation for considering such an ansatz is due to black string solutions of einstein - maxwell - dilaton gravity which was first introduced in ref .",
    "now , we are in a position to obtain metric functions .",
    "it is a matter of calculation to show that by using eq .",
    "( [ ftr eq ] ) , the metric ( [ metric ] ) and the mentioned ansatz for @xmath33 , we have following solutions for the field equations , ( eqs .",

    ", @xmath54 is an integration constant which is related to the total mass of the black hole .",
    "it is notable that , in the absence of a non - trivial dilaton ( @xmath55 ) , the solution ( f(r ) ) reduces to @xmath56which describes a @xmath17-dimensional asymptotically ads topological charged black hole in gravity s rainbow with a positive , zero or negative constant curvature hypersurface .    in order to confirm black hole interpretation of the solutions , we look for the curvature singularity .",
    "to do so , we calculate the kretschmann scalar .",
    "calculations show that for finite values of radial coordinate , the kretschmann scalar is finite . on the other hand , for very small and very large values of @xmath57",

    "in this section , we study thermal stability of the solutions in context of the canonical ensemble .",
    "the stability conditions in the context of canonical ensemble are determined by the sign of the heat capacity . in other words , the positivity / negativity of the heat capacity",
    "is denoted as the black object being in stable / unstable state .",
    "therefore , in order to study the stability of the charged black holes in dilatonic gravity s rainbow , we study the changes in the sign of corresponding heat capacity . it is worthwhile to mention that investigating the behavior of the heat capacity enables one to obtain the phase transitions of the solutions at the same time .",
    "the root and divergence point of the heat capacity are denoted as bounded point ( @xmath74 ) and second order phase transition point ( @xmath75 ) , respectively . bounded point is related to the root of temperature and the sign of @xmath76 changes at @xmath74 , while we expect to obtain positive temperature at @xmath75 .",
    "the system in canonical ensemble is considered to be in fixed charge .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath77    considering the mentioned bounded and phase transition points , one can obtain @xmath78    there are three valuable known cases for the rainbow functions which are characteristics of the rainbow solutions .",

    "this condition for ds spacetime is opposite .",
    "in other words , the real valued divergency is obtained if @xmath91 .",
    "( see eqs .",
    "( [ root - flat ] ) and ( [ div ] ) for more details ) .",
    "in order to charged black holes in dilatonic gravity s rainbow with flat horizon be stable , following conditions must be hold @xmath92    as for the cases of @xmath93 , it was not possible to obtain the analytical relations for the root and divergence point of the heat capacity .",
    "therefore , we employ numerical method for studying the properties of the heat capacity for spherical and hyperbolic horizons . as for the stability conditions ,",
    "there are different orders of the horizon radius for each term .",
    "these terms will have dominant effect in specific regions of horizon radius and other parameters .",
    "considering the effectiveness of these terms , the stability conditions will vary from one case to another one .",
    "also , these effective behaviors may present different regions of stability and instability . taking a closer look at different terms",
    ", one can see that the most effective parameter in stability conditions which modifies the exponent of horizon radius highly and changes the positivity and negativity of each term , is dilaton parameter , @xmath94 .",
    "in other words , considering different values of @xmath94 , stable / unstable regions will be modified highly .",
    "this highlights the effect of dilaton field on thermodynamical behavior of the solutions .    in order to give a better insight regarding the thermodynamical behavior of these black holes , we study the behavior of the temperature",
    "the reason is the fact that negativity of the temperature represents nonphysical systems which are not of our interest .",
    "therefore , we study the conditions for positivity / negativity of the temperature . considering eq .",
    "( [ temp ] ) , there are three terms which are related to electric charge , cosmological constant and topological structure of the metric .",
    "the effectiveness of each term is a function of their factors .",
    "therefore , considering different values for these factors may lead to one of the following scenarios : one root and temperature is an increasing function of horizon radius ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , no root and temperature is negative with one maximum ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , two roots with one region of positivity and two regions of negativity ( fig .",

    "charged term is always negative in eq .",
    "( [ temp ] ) .",
    "if one considers ads solutions , the second term will be positive .",
    "as for the last term , if spherical solution is chosen , then in order for topological term be positive , the dilaton parameter must be @xmath95 .",
    "whereas in case of hyperbolic horizon the condition will be modified into @xmath96 . on the other hand , if ds solutions are considered , the second term will be negative .",
    "therefore , the possibility of having positive temperature depends on topological term with mentioned conditions for spherical and hyperbolic cases .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that horizon flat of ds solutions has negative temperature .",

    "this phase transition point is represented by a divergency of the heat capacity .",
    "increasing dilaton parameter leads to decreasing the place of divergency of the heat capacity and increasing the region in which we have unstable physical solutions ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . the larger root of the temperature is highly sensitive to variation of the @xmath24 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . for sufficiently large values of the dilaton parameter ,",
    "the temperature is a decreasing function of the horizon radius with one root .",

    "the singularities of the ricci scalar of this phase space , marks two different properties of the solutions : one is a bound point which is related to the root of the temperature and marks the physical and non - physical solutions . the other one is related to singularities of the heat capacity which are marking the points which system goes under phase transition .",
    "considering such property for the constructed phase space , a valid approach of the geometrical thermodynamics produces a ricci scalar which has singularities that cover both of the mentioned points . depending on the thermodynamical potential",

    "in other words , the divergencies of their ricci scalar may not coincide with root and divergencies of the heat capacity . on the other hand",
    ", it is seen that all the divergencies of the curvature scalar of the hpem metric match with bound and phase transition points of the heat capacity .",
    "the nature of the behavior of the ricci scalar around each one of these divergencies enables one to recognize whether it is a bound point or a divergence point in heat capacity @xcite .",

    "is give by @xcite @xmath108    it was shown that the gravitational theory under consideration may affect this relation and modifies it @xcite . in calculations of the conserved and thermodynamical quantities , we found that these quantities were modified due to existence of gravity s rainbow and dilaton field .",
    "it is natural to question whether the usual relation between cosmological constant and thermodynamical pressure could be modified in presence of the dilaton field as well as rainbow functions . to investigate such modification",

    "it is worthwhile to mention that critical horizon radius depends only on one of the rainbow functions whereas the other critical values and also the ratio @xmath120 are functions of both of them . in addition , it is notable that in the absence of dilaton field ( @xmath121 ) and low energy limit ( @xmath122 ) , eq .",

    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] ) , energy of different phases and size of swallow - tails ( right panels of figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] ) are functions of gravity s rainbow and dilaton parameter .",
    "the effects of rainbow functions and dilaton parameter on critical values are different from each other ( compare figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] with [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "interestingly , for a set of values , it is possible to obtain positive critical pressure and horizon radius whereas the temperature is negative .",
    "the plotted diagrams for these cases show a normal critical behavior in @xmath131 diagram ( left panel of fig .",

    "also normal critical behavior is observed except that this behavior is located in negative temperature .",
    "in this section , we will obtain critical points through a method which was developed in ref .",

    "the denominator of the heat capacity is employed to obtain an explicit relation for thermodynamical pressure .",
    "obtained relation may yield a maximum(s ) for pressure which is(are ) critical pressure(s ) in which a second order phase transition takes place .",
    "this critical pressure is exactly the same as that of obtained through the use of phase diagrams .    using eqs .",

    "now , by using values that are employed for plotting phase diagrams ( figs . [ fig4]-[fig6 ] ) , we plot following diagrams ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "a simple comparison shows that the maximums of the plotted diagrams are exactly where corresponding critical pressure and horizon radius are located in phase diagrams .",
    "this shows that these two approaches yield consisting picture regarding the critical behavior of these black holes . on the other hand ,",
    "plotted diagram which corresponds to one with abnormal behavior ( middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) also represents the characteristic behavior of the phase transition point .",
    "therefore , in case of these black holes , a phase transition occurs in the mentioned critical point .",
    "in this paper , we studied @xmath17-dimensional charged dilatonic black holes in gravity s rainbow and their thermal stability conditions .",
    "we obtained thermodynamical quantities such as temperature , electric charge , entropy and total mass of the black holes .",
    "these quantities were modified in gravity s rainbow and became energy dependent .",
    "next , we conducted a study regarding physical / nonphysical black holes ( positivity / negativity of temperature ) and thermal stability of the solutions .",
    "it was pointed out that dominant factor in studying these properties is the dilaton parameter . in other words , these properties were highly sensitive to variation of @xmath94 . due to different factors of dilaton parameter ,",
    "different types of behavior were observed for temperature which put restrictions on the solutions being physical . observed behaviors for the temperature were : a ) two roots with maximum , b ) an increasing ( a decreasing ) function of horizon radius with one root c ) a negative definite function with one maximum .",
    "the analyzed behaviors were , increasing function of horizon radius with one root , increasing and decreasing function of horizon radius with two roots , decreasing function of the @xmath101 with one root located and being negative with one maximum located at negative temperature .",
    "as for the stability and phase transition , we found depending on the behavior of the temperature , heat capacity could have phase transition and stable state for larger values of horizon radius . in case of two roots for temperature ,",
    "interestingly , a phase transition of larger / smaller black hole was observed .",
    "finally , as for temperature being decreasing function of @xmath135 , for physical solutions ( positive temperature ) , unstable solutions were observed . in other words , in this case , physical solutions are unstable .    next",
    ", geometrical approach was employed to study the bound and phase transition points of these black holes .",
    "it was demonstrated that the ricci scalars of the phase spaces of weinhold , ruppeiner and quevedo metrics , have divergencies which do not match with mentioned points while the singular points of curvature scalar of the hpem coincide with roots and divergence points of the heat capacity .",
    "we also , studied the critical behavior of these black holes in extended phase space .",
    "it was shown that the usual relation between cosmological constant and thermodynamical pressure was modified due to existence of dilaton gravity whereas such modification was not seen for gravity s rainbow .",
    "on the contrary , it was shown that volume of the black holes depends on both of these modifications .",
    "then , we showed that the critical values are related to the rainbow functions as well as the dilaton parameter . in order to have positive critical temperature , we found restrictions which were purely dilatonic dependant . therefore , one is not free to choose any value for dilaton parameter .    in studying phase diagrams ,",
    "two different behaviors were observed for different diagrams , especially in @xmath127 diagrams .",
    "interestingly , although we observed an anomaly in these diagrams , other corresponding phase diagrams presented usual thermodynamical behavior around critical points . in other words , the observed abnormal behaviors in phase diagrams present the existence of a second order phase transition for these black holes .",
    "next , we used a new method which was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , for studying the critical behavior of the system .",
    "this method is based on obtaining an explicit form for thermodynamical pressure from denominator of the heat capacity .",
    "it was seen that the maximum maximum of this relation is located at the critical pressure and horizon radius in which second order phase transition takes place .",
    "it was shown that in this method , for irregular behavior which was observed in phase diagrams , also a second order phase transition occurs .",
    "this indicates that these points are phase transition point despite their abnormal behavior .    finally , it is worthwhile to think about the physical interpretation of abnormal behavior which was seen in this paper .",
    "it is notable that , one can generalize obtained linear solutions in this paper to nonlinear case of electrodynamics and investigate the effects of nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "in addition , one may investigate the extended phase space and thermodynamic criticality in higher order lovelock - maxwell gravity s rainbow as well as lovelock - nonlinear electrodynamics @xcite .",
