    "with over 900 exoplanets discovered and more to come in the near future , exoplanet research today is anything but dull .",
    "the synergy between space and ground work is delivering outstanding results and the menagerie of exoplanets is becoming more diverse .",
    "for instance the _ kepler _ mission ( borucki et al . 2010 , 2011 ) has delivered , among other impressive discoveries , the smallest exoplanet known to date ( barclay et al .",
    "2013 ) , and the high - resolution spectrograph _ harps _ at the european southern observatory has detected a new earth - sized exoplanet around @xmath1 centauri b ( dumusque et al .",
    "2012 ) .    beyond the key parameters of mass , radius and orbital inclination , the next critical step is to determine the chemical composition of these exotic worlds .",
    "detecting atmospheric features , which have a contrast of about 10@xmath2 compared to the host star s radiation , is quite a challenge .",
    "however , for transiting exoplanets this has proven to be feasible from space and the ground . with the high stability of the spitzer space telescope and the hubble space telescope ,",
    "the spectra of bright close - in massive planets have been obtained and ionic / atomic / molecular species such as ionized forms of hydrogen , silicon , carbon , magnesium , as well as alkali metals , water vapor , methane , carbon monoxide and dioxide have been detected in a handful of these planets . with the demise of  cold spitzer  and nicmos",
    "though , the wavelength range covered from space has narrowed .",
    "however on the positive side the new wide field camera 3 on hubble is already delivering novel and interesting results ( berta et al .",
    "2012 , swain et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "whilst in previous years the transit technique , combined with the photometric precision of hubble and spitzer , has been an asset for the success of this field , the impossibility of repeating observations had led to debates in the community .",
    "some of these concerns have been addressed by adopting more robust and objective statistical techniques to remove instrumental systematics ( gregory 2011 , gibson et al .",

    "however , observations from the ground can be repeated more easily ( waldmann et al . 2012 ) and in some cases they can cover spectral regions not reachable from space ( swain et al .",

    "the remaining nights were sufficiently photometrically stable to allow the extraction of low resolution spectra in those bands . given that the j- , h- and k - bands were observed simultaneously , these measurements have a clear advantage for atmospheric interpretation over photometric data recorded at different times ( sing et al .",

    "2012 ) .    to analyse the data , we have used the techniques described in swain et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and waldmann et al .",
    "( 2012 ) tailored for transmission spectroscopy .",
    "these techniques have been validated on observations with a reference star in the field over the 0.28 - 4.2 @xmath0 m spectral range ( l - band ) , where the telluric contamination is high .",
    "waldmann et al .",
    "( 2012 ) found that the spectrum of the observed reference star was flat , indicating an adequate background subtraction .",
    "we describe here the observations obtained on 12 june 2008 and 22 july 2008 , using the spex spectrograph at the nasa infrared telescope facility .",
    "the instrument was configured in the short - wavelength cross - dispersed mode ( sxd : 0.8 - 2.5 @xmath0 m ) , in which five orders of the spectrograph covered the spectral range from 0.8 to 2.5 @xmath0 m simultaneously , with a small gap in wavelength coverage due to a strong telluric absorption feature between 1.81 and 1.86 @xmath0 m ( rayner et al .",
    "we used a slit of 1@xmath76@xmath815@xmath7 , an average integration time of 6 sec and the abba nodding sequence .",
    "flat field and argon lamp calibrations were obtained before and after the transit .",
    "the observations were scheduled to start two hours before the planetary ingress and to stop two hours after the planetary egress .",
    "comparing the two nights , 22 july 2008 presents a higher scatter and a gap in the lightcurves between -0.032 and -0.028 of the normalized orbital phase , due to a switch - off of the instrument . moreover its signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) is lower than the snr obtained over the night of 12 ( fig .",
    "[ snr ] ) .",
    "an additional transit event has been observed with the same settings on 23 june 2010 , but was discarded due to the unrecoverable changes of throughput during the planetary ingress .",
    "we used the spex data reduction package , spextool ( cushing et al .",
    "2004 ) and we applied the standard calibration procedure , which includes background subtraction , flat fielding and wavelength calibration .",
    "this procedure yielded sets of 382 and 450 individual stellar spectra for the first and the second night respectively .",
    "we removed the outliers by sigma clipping the time - series @xmath9 at 4@xmath10 and we replaced the bad pixels with the mean of the surrounding pixels .",
    "we applied a first - order airmass correction , using the cosine - based approximation provided by david tholen in the idl library .",
    "we then obtained the modified time - series @xmath11 .",
    "to extract the planetary signal from the raw data , we used de - noising techniques followed by amplification of the signal .",
    "we applied the _ model - correlate - fit _ ( mcf ) method ( swain et al .",
    "2010 , waldmann et al .",
    "2012 ) to the data , which is useful when the wavelength correlated noise is stronger than the channel - to - channel differential signal .",
    "the mcf approach allows the extraction of the exoplanetary signal by correlating multiple time - series in the fourier domain .",
    "since here we treat primary transit observations , we removed the average transit depth in the j- , h- and k- bands by dividing by the mean flux of the analysed band .",
    "the final spectrum is thus a differential transmission spectrum .",
    "a critical step in our analysis is the cleaning of all the non - random temporal changes in the spectro - photometric time - series that are not strictly associated with the exoplanetary transit ( i.e. variations of pixel sensitivity , bias offsets ) .",
    "we therefore normalised each spectrum @xmath12 ( @xmath13 corresponds to each spectral frame of the dataset ) to remove all the systematic errors correlated in wavelength :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the normalized spectrum , @xmath12 is the flux of each spectrum @xmath13 as a function of wavelength @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the mean flux of the analysed band , which ranges from @xmath18 = 0.94 @xmath0 m to @xmath19 = 1.39 @xmath0 m for the j - band , from @xmath18 = 1.41 @xmath0 m to @xmath19 = 1.81 @xmath0 m for the h - band and from @xmath18 = 1.94 @xmath0 m to @xmath19 = 2.42 @xmath0 m for the k - band :    @xmath20    it is important to stress that the normalisation of the broad - band flux does not erase the wavelength - dependent spectral modulations .    among the data sets analysed , the one recorded on 12 june 2008 presents fewer systematics and",
    "is more uniform in terms of scatter and flux modulations .",
    "in contrast , 22 july 2008 data exhibit a higher scatter , especially during the pre - ingress , most likely due to the poorer atmospheric conditions ( i.e. probably the presence of a thin layer of cirrus ) .",
    "we noticed that for highly scattered time - series , the removal of the mean broad - band flux caused an offset between the a and b frames obtained with the nodding technique .",
    "these problematic time - series , either at the edges of the bands analysed or associated with low snr ( fig .",
    "[ snr ] ) , were discarded to prevent the addition of systematics .",
    "however , one needs to be cautious about this process : while a proper correction must be applied to eliminate the systematics , too few spectral channels do not allow us to extract a meaningful signal .",
    "the number of data points and the uncertainties in the final spectra ( fig .",
    "[ hband ] , [ kband ] ) are directly related to this critical step .",
    "we applied a second normalisation to remove residual fluctuations in the time - series , obtaining @xmath21 :    @xmath22    @xmath23    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the number of spectral channels we combined and @xmath26 is the mean flux of the @xmath25 channels .",
    "@xmath27 represents a set of @xmath25 channels .",
    "@xmath25 should be optimised depending on the quality of the dataset .",
    "we found that usually @xmath28 100 to 150 was a good compromise between the snr requirements and the spectral resolution .",
    "the second panel in fig .",
    "[ block_diagram ] shows a lightcurve for a single channel after all the corrections .    after the pre - cleaning process , each lightcurve @xmath29 is still too noisy to show the transit .",
    "we extracted the signal common to all time - series by fourier - transforming all the time - series in the spectral band considered and by stacking together the @xmath25-transformed spectral channels ( fig .",
    "[ block_diagram ] , third panel ) . in effect",
    ", we are taking the geometric mean of _ x _ channels . as a result",
    ", the spectral resolution is reduced .",
    "finally , we take the inverse fourier transform to convert the data back into the time domain :    @xmath30 ) ^{1/x } \\label{selfcohe}\\ ] ]    where @xmath31 denotes the fourier transform and @xmath32 its inverse ( see details in appendix [ appendix ] ) .",
    "we fitted each of the final lightcurves with two components : a residual baseline curve ( characterised by a second order polynomial function ) fitted to the out - of - transit and a transit lightcurve model ( mandel @xmath6 agol 2002 ) with the transit depth being the only free parameter ( fig .",
    "[ block_diagram ] , bottom panel ) .",
    "we used the limb - darkening coefficients by claret ( 2000 ) .",
    "the transit depths @xmath33 of these final lightcurves are the differential transmission spectra .",
    "we repeated the same procedure for j- , h- and k- bands for both nights .    to calculate the error bars",
    ", we considered both the standard deviation of the model subtracted residual , @xmath34 , and the standard deviation of the transit depth derived from changing baseline fits , @xmath35 .",
    "the final standard deviation @xmath10 is given by the quadrature of the two previous terms : @xmath36 .    to test the robustness of our results",
    ", we used a markov - chain monte carlo method ( mcmc ) to re - fit the lightcurves .",
    "we did two mcmc fits , the first one to model the residual baseline curve and the second one to fit the transit lightcurves .",
    "the posteriors of the first fit were used to create a covariance matrix . from the same covariance matrix we generated a multivariate prior for the second fit .",
    "the retrieved depths and standard deviations are consistent with our previous analysis ( fig .",
    "[ histogram ] ) .    additionally , combining the spectra obtained for the 12 june 2008 night we obtained a transmission spectrum of hd-189733b that covers the wavelength range from 0.94 - 2.4 @xmath0 m .",
    "as the wavelength variation shown by the result is indicative of the presence of spectral features , we proceeded to analyse this aspect .",
    "we thus compared the final transmission spectrum with synthetic models of the planetary atmosphere ( see sect .",
    "[ results ] , fig . [ water ] , [ models ] ) .",
    "note that this comparison is possible as all the j-,h- and k- band spectra were recorded simultaneously .",
    "the transmission spectra were modelled using a line - by - line radiative transfer code as described in tinetti et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , tinetti et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and hollis et al .",
    "for all models , an isothermal atmospheric profile at @xmath37 , probing down to a pressure of 10 bar , was used .",
    "the atmosphere was taken to be cloud - free initially , but rayleigh scattering due to molecular hydrogen ( liou 2002 ) was included , determined assuming a bulk composition of @xmath38 molecular hydrogen and @xmath39 atomic helium , with particle sizes and refractive indices from vardya ( 1962 ) and allen ( 2000 ) .",
    "thus the mean molecular weight of the atmosphere was taken to be @xmath40 , giving a pressure scale height of approximately @xmath41 for example at a temperature of @xmath42 .",
    "h@xmath3 - h@xmath3 collision - induced absorption ( hereafter : cia - borysow et al .",
    "1997 ) was also included - this continuum ( plus rayleigh scattering at the shorter wavelengths ) provides an effective absorption floor , on top of which was added absorption from h@xmath3o , ch@xmath4 , co@xmath3 and co , these being the molecules previously detected on the dayside ( swain et al .",
    "2009 , madhusudhan @xmath6 seager 2009 , lee et al .",
    "2012 , line et al . 2012 ) . the mixing ratios ( abundances ) of these molecules were varied in order to determine the best composition , i.e. to provide an adequate fit to the observations .    for most of the molecules",
    "considered , theoretical line lists from the _ exomol _ project ( tennyson et al . 2012 ) were used . for the h@xmath3o molecule , absorption cross - sections were obtained from barber et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , which contributes absorption features in the 0.94 - 2.42 @xmath0 m range in particular .",
    "the ch@xmath4 opacity was modelled using a preliminary version of a new variational line list at high temperature ( t=1000k ; yurchenko et al . , in prep .",
    ") . for the co and co@xmath3 molecules , the hitemp line list ( rothman et al .",
    "2010 ) was used .",
    "the cloud opacity was calculated using the mie - lorenz scattering approximation given by liou ( 2002 ) , with the cloud particle size taken to be single - valued rather than a distribution around some mean size , for simplicity and to avoid further model degeneracies where possible .",
    "even with this simplified approach though , it can be seen that it is possible to fit both data with a mie - like signature at small wavelengths with those data exhibiting spectral features due to molecular absorption at longer wavelengths .",
    "thus multi - band observations that have previously been claimed to be mutually inconsistent can potentially be drawn together into a single model framework .",
    "a more rigorous approach including more physically - motivated cloud properties ( e.g. using various cloud particle size distributions , and appropriate refractive indices ) would allow further tuning of such models for better fits to the observations .",
    "however , since the different data were measured at different epochs with different instruments , and are further subject to varying systematic offsets and stellar activity levels , combining and comparing such datasets must always be done with the utmost caution , with any inferences also subject to these caveats .",
    "using the method described in the previous section , we analysed the j- , h- and k - band data for both nights . by combining sets of 150 channels we extracted the differential depths as a function of @xmath16 ( table [ depth ] ) .",
    "we show in figs .",
    "[ j_lightcurves ] and [ lightcurves ] the lightcurves for the first night , j- and h- , k- respectively . notice that this approach does not provide an accurate absolute calibration , but rather a relative measurement",
    ". uncertainties much higher than the photon - noise and the residual correlation are typical of ground - based observations and depend on the quality of the data .",
    "the uncertainties in our data are , on average for the first night , three times larger than photon noise in the h - band and two times larger in the j- and k - bands . for the second night",
    "the uncertainties for the h- and k- bands are three times larger than the photon noise .",
    "the j - band on the second night showed a lower signal level . + to test the statistical significance of our results we estimated the auto - correlation function ( acf ) for our time - series before and after the data reduction ( fig .",
    "[ autocorr ] ) . given a discrete signal @xmath43 , the acf(@xmath44 ) is the cross - correlation of the signal @xmath43 with itself , at lag @xmath44 :    @xmath45    where @xmath46 denotes the complex conjugate . for wide sense",
    "stationary white noise , the acf will show a peak at @xmath44 = 0 with all other lags within the one sigma bounds of white noise .",
    "values outside these bounds indicate a significant autocorrelation ( in this case in time ) of the signal at the respective lag . in fig .",
    "[ autocorr ] we present the acf over 370 lags for one raw lightcurve and for the residual to the final lightcurve .",
    "the raw data present a strong correlation .",
    "by contrast , the autocorrelation for final residuals is all within a 1@xmath10 confidence level and their amplitudes are negligible .",
    "this indicates that correlations in time were efficiently removed and that our results are normally distributed and auto - correlative noise is decreased at most frequencies . at lower lags , some residual correlation persists but these systematics are at frequencies higher than the time scale of the transit event of hd-189733b , hence the signal should not be directly affected .",
    "+ given the good atmospheric transmission window from 0.94 -1.30 @xmath0 m ( fig . [ transmission ] ) and the good quality of the 12 june 2008 data , we compared the j - band spectrum to synthetic models that included h@xmath3o , ch@xmath4 , co@xmath3 and co , these being the molecules detected in the dayside of the planet ( fig .",
    "[ models ] ) .",
    "we tested one molecule at a time followed by combinations of these .",
    "the best fit for the j - band was obtained with water with a mixing ratio of 5@xmath47 at a temperature of t @xmath28 1500k .",
    "we then compared the best model achieved with the whole 0.94 - 2.42 @xmath0 m spectral range .",
    "note that our j- , h- and k - band spectra are relative measurements , hence their absolute level is unconstrained .",
    "it is therefore possible to renormalise their offsets .",
    "thus , keeping our j - band spectrum fixed , we matched the h- and k - band spectra to the model , finding an excellent agreement .",
    "the best fit was given by the model that includes water with a mixing ratio of 5@xmath4810@xmath2 at a temperature that ranges between t@xmath281000 - 1500 k. we also tested the possibility of a flat spectrum by fitting a straight line to the data , however this gave a poor fit as confirmed by the @xmath49 ( see fig .",
    "[ water ] ) .",
    "while the spectra obtained during the two nights are consistent with each other within the error bars , the spectra extracted on the first night are of superior quality . among the hurdles encountered , we can list the small gap in the flux during the orbital phase , the instrumental systematics ( e.g. variations of the pixel sensitivity ) , the residual telluric contamination , and the presence of high altitude clouds during the second night .",
    "all these effects may influence our results at different levels , but by applying the mcf method to the irtf data we have been able to extract statistically significant planetary spectra .",
    "the acf test in fact proves that our results are normally distributed and auto - correlative noise is decreased at most frequencies .",
    "nonetheless these results could be largely improved by combining together a large number of good nights . as demonstrated by waldmann et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , we can potentially amplify our signal by a factor @xmath50 by combining @xmath51 multiple good observations . in the work presented here two of the nights",
    "could be used including one of excellent quality , one was unusable .",
    "we decided to flag the measurements at 1.35 @xmath0 m and 2 @xmath0 m ( marked in figs .",
    "[ water ] , [ models ] in yellow ) as less reliable . at these wavelengths ,",
    "the telluric contamination is very high and it might affect the measurements ( fig . [ transmission ] ) .",
    "in addition , the data point at 1.35 @xmath0 m includes fewer spectral channels than our standard procedure , as it lies at the end of the band .",
    "the entire mcf method is an efficient procedure to remove , through several steps , the telluric contamination contained in the raw data .",
    "the raw data contain both the signal and the noise components .",
    "these components are difficult to disentangle in the time - domain , but can be described by different sets of frequencies in the fourier domain .",
    "this is why , when we combine together @xmath52 fourier - transformed lightcurves , noise such as the telluric contamination is weakened , while the transit signal is strengthened .",
    "we refer to waldmann et al .",
    "( 2012 ) for a detailed explanation . to quantify the residual contamination by systematics we applied the procedure described in sect .",
    "[ datanalysis ] only to the out - of - transit lightcurve , i.e. , removing the eclipse signal .",
    "we find that the amplitude of the systematic noise and the residual telluric component is within the uncertainties of the planetary signal over the whole spectrum .",
    "the effectiveness of the mcf was tested with the acf .",
    "+ additionally , we report the weather conditions over the two nights . fig .",
    "[ weather ] shows the temperature , relative humidity and pressure readings of the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) weather station as well as the atmospheric opacity at 225 ghz by the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) .",
    "no significant correlations between these parameters and the expected transit shape was found .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ transmission ] the atmospheric trasmission on mauna kea , obtained in similar conditions to our nights ( ukirt web pages ) .",
    "the intensity of the transmission is on average @xmath53 , with some absorption features around 1.125 @xmath0 m , 1.41 @xmath0 m , and 2.06 @xmath0 m whose effect reflects directly on the error bars of the data points evaluated at the same wavelength .",
    "those error bars are in fact the largest in the j- , h- and k- band respectively .",
    "the strongest telluric absorptions are reported around 1.355 @xmath0 m and 2.0 @xmath0 m ; hence the decision to flag the two measurements at those wavelengths as less reliable .      to test the robustness of our technique we injected a synthetic planetary spectrum into our data and we proceeded with the mfc process as detailed in [ datanalysis ] . for the simulation we chose co@xmath5 as it is an abundant molecule in the earth s atmosphere .",
    "we used a mixing ratio of 10@xmath54 and an isothermal atmosphere temperature of t@xmath281500k .",
    "the mcf process retrieved the correct amplitude of the artificially injected signal within the errors .",

    "given that the irtf ground - based measurements and the hubble space - based measurements have completely different sources of systematic errors , the consistency among ground and space observations is quite remarkable .",
    "as mentioned in sect . [ results ] we used the 12 june 2008 j - band spectrum and simulated models to calibrate the h- and k- band spectra recorded during the same night .",
    "the models generated included the contributions of h@xmath3o , ch@xmath4 , co@xmath3 and co. the best fit to the data was given by the water opacity , with a retrieved abundance somewhere in the range 1 - 5@xmath56 if in the models the floor is due to collision - induced absorption and rayleigh scattering .",
