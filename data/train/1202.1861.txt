    ", these electrons may experience strong spin fluctuations and probably form extremely low - dimensional ( low - d ) antiferromagnet ( afm ) , or even exotic spin liquid , quantum disorder , or quantum spin hall state , so it has attracted great interest in recent theories @xcite .",
    "a recent synthesized honeycomb compound in@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 @xcite is such a system with reduced dimensionality and frustration . according to the chemical valence analysis ,",
    "the copper ions with 3@xmath13 configuration contribute a spin-1/2 magnetic moment , while the 3@xmath6 orbitals in vanadium ions are empty and contribute no magnetic moment . due to the large separation between cu",
    "/ v - o layers , the copper spins form a quasi-2d honeycomb lattice @xcite .",
    "this compound exhibits unusual magnetic behavior : it shows neither an afm long - range order in magnetic susceptibility measurement , nor any magnetic phase transition peak in specific heat data @xcite .",
    "however , zn or co doping can induce a weak or strong three - dimensional ( 3d ) afm long - range order observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "it inspires great interest in such a topic : whether the ground state of this compound is low - dimensional afm , or spin liquid predicted by meng _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "additionally , it is well known that noninteracting or weakly interacting electrons in hexagonal graphene is a typical example of _ dirac _ fermions .",
    "it is not very clear that how the properties of dirac fermions evolve with the increase of coulomb interactions .",
    "therefore , in@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 with hexagonal cu ions is probably a realistic material to testify how the electronic correlations affect the _ dirac _ fermions . in the meantime , through the magnetic susceptibility and specific heat measurements , it s hard to distinguish possible ground state between a low - dimensional afm and a spin liquid @xcite .",
    "all of these drive us to explore the electronic properties and magnetism in in@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 by combining the first - principles electronic structure calculations and analytic methods , since it could provide us first insight to this compound .    utilizing the local density functional ( lda ) and the correlation correction approaches , together with the analytical perturbation method , we show that in@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 is an afm charge transfer insulator with copper d@xmath3 orbitals half filled and contributing @xmath4 = 1/2 spins",

    "furthermore , we show that the absence of 3d afm long - range order observed experimentally in in@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 arises from the magnetic frustration of cu spins along the @xmath12-axis , leading to a quantum disorder phase . meanwhile , in terms of this new scenario , we address the evolution of the magnetic properties on the co and zn dopings in in@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 , giving a plausible explanation of the experimental behavior .",
    "we also suggest the possibility that doping in oxygen sites may drive the system to a spin liquid or superconducting phase . the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "iii , we present the major numerical results and our analysis ; sec .",
    "iv is devoted to the remarks and conclusion .",
    "we first study the electronic state properties of the honeycomb compound in@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 by employing the first - principles electronic structure calculation approach so as to elucidate its groundstate properties .",
    "the electronic structure calculations were performed using the self - consistent full potential linearized augmented - plane - wave ( fp - lapw ) scheme in the wien2k programme package .",
    "we used 36 @xmath15 points in the irreducible part of the first brillouin zone .",
    "the muffin - tin sphere radii were selected to be 2.36 , 1.93 , and 1.71 a.u .",
    "for in , cu ( v ) , and o in in@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 .",
    "the plane - wave cutoff parameter @xmath16 was 7.0 , and the cutoff between the core and valence states was @xmath177.0 ry in all calculations .",
    "exchange and correlation effects were taken into account in the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) by perdew , burk , and ernzerhof ( pbe ) @xcite . in order to explicitly take into account the correlated effect of the 3@xmath6 electrons of cu ( v ) ions",
    ", we also performed gga+@xmath18 calculations for in@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 .",
    "the effective coulomb interaction @xmath19 = @xmath20 ( @xmath18 and @xmath21 are the on - site coulomb interaction and the hund s rule coupling , respectively ) was used instead of @xmath18 .",
    "we take @xmath19 = 8.0 ev for copper and 4.0 ev for vanadium according to the similar compounds @xcite .    to model the low - energy process in in@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 , the tight - binding parameters in the nm ( or paramagnetic ( pm ) ) phase are necessary .",
    "we also perform the local density functional ( lda ) calculations for nm in@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 . the nm band structures of in@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 are obtained by using the full - potential linearized augmented plane - wave plus local orbitals ( fp - lapw+lo ) scheme implemented in the wien2k package @xcite . in order to compare our numerical results with the experimental data ,",
    "we adopt the experimental structural data of in@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 measured by neutron powder diffraction @xcite .",
    "this compound has an orthorhombic structure with space group @xmath22 and lattice constants @xmath23 = 10.0491 @xmath24 , @xmath25 = 5.8019 @xmath24 , and @xmath12 = 11.8972 @xmath24 , as shown in fig .",
    "it was found that in@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 has a honeycomb layered structure with cu atoms forming hexagonal net and v atoms in the center of an hexagon .",
    "a cu atom is surrounded by five o atoms in a trigonal bipyramidal environment .",
    "detailed results of band structure are addressed in what follows .",
    "we first present the nm electronic structures of in@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 in fig .",
    "it shows that the major orbital character of the band structures near @xmath26 is a @xmath27 symmetry of copper 3@xmath6 orbitals .",
    "this cu 3@xmath28 orbital in the honeycomb lattice , similar to the @xmath29 orbital of carbon in graphene , contributes an outstanding property of the band structures , _",
    "i.e. _ , a _ dirac _",
    "cone with the approximately linear spectrum is observed around the @xmath30 point , as seen in fig .",
    "the linear energy spectrum ranges from @xmath170.2 to 0.2 ev .",
    "we notice that the original _ dirac _ point around the @xmath31 points opens a small energy gap , about 0.2 ev , also as seen in fig .",
    "2 , which is attributed to the weak interlayer coupling between cu / v - o hexagonal planes .    though parts of empty v 3@xmath6 orbital are near the top of cu 3@xmath28 orbitals , they do not directly hybridize with each other considerably .",
    "a part of filled oxygen 2@xmath5 orbitals are close to the bottom of cu 3@xmath28 orbitals , and these 2@xmath5 orbitals also do not considerably mix with 3@xmath28 orbitals , as we see the partial density of states ( pdos ) of in@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 in fig .",
    "3 . thus the low - energy physics in in@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 could be approximately described by the cu 3@xmath28 orbitals across@xmath7 .",
    "based on the fact that cu 3@xmath28 orbitals mainly distribute from @xmath171.0 ev to 0.4 ev , we extract these four cu 3@xmath28 bands ( notice that we have four cu atoms in primitive cell ) from the full band structures and fit these bands with a single - orbital tight - binding model with the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) , next nn ( nnn ) and @xmath32 nn hopping integrals in the cu / v - o plane and between the planes .",
    "these tight - binding parameters are listed in table i. notice that the lda methods deal with the nm state rather than the pm one .",
    "but as we know , the overlap and hopping integrals of electrons depend on the spatial wavefunctions , and are independent of the spin degree of freedom .",
    "thus the hopping parameters obtained in the nm state are the same to those in the pm state .",
    ".tight - binding parameters @xmath33 and superexchange spin coupling strengths @xmath34 in in@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 .",
    "subscripts @xmath35 and @xmath36 represent the nn , nnn , @xmath32 nn hopping integrals or spin coupling strengths in the planes , and the nn ones between the planes , respectively .",
    "all the energies are measured in units of mev . [ cols=\"<,>,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     one can easily find that the intraplane nn hopping integral @xmath37 is about 7.5 , 31 and 3.7 times of the intraplane nnn hopping @xmath38 , 3@xmath39 hopping @xmath40 and the interplane nn hopping @xmath41 , respectively , suggesting the nn hopping and nn spin coupling dominate the transfer process and magnetic correlations in the ground state of in@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 .      to understand the magnetism and insulating nature of undoped compound , we further adopt the spin - polarized gga and correlation - corrected gga+@xmath18 schemes to uncover the groundstate properties of strongly correlated in@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 .",
    "we consider five kinds of different magnetic configurations , nm , ferromagnet ( fm ) , a - type afm ( _ i.e. _ , interlayer afm and intralayer fm ) , and g1- and g2-type afm as the possible candidate ground state . here",
    "g1- and g2-type afm configurations shown in fig .",
    "6 are two different magnetic structures , both of which are derived from a conventional g - type afm . in comparison with the g1-type afm structure ,",
    "the lower cu / v - o hexagon ( or cu / v - o layer ) in the g2-type structure rotates @xmath42/3 degree .",
    "thus the g1-type spin configuration differs from the g2-type one .",
    "our gga+@xmath18 numerical results show that the total energy of the nm state is the highest , and that of the g1- and g2-type afm states are the lowest .",
    "interestingly , we find that the g1- and g2-type afm states are degenerate .",
    "this arises from the interlayer magnetic frustration of cu spins , as will be discussed in detail later .",
    "the total energy difference between the fm and a - type afm configurations is rather small .",
    "the energy difference between the lowest g1(g2)-type afm and the second lowest a - type afm or fm states is about 58.5 mev , suggesting that the afm magnetic couplings between cu spins in in@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 are dominant .    to examine the effect of the on - site coulomb interaction parameter @xmath18 on the calculation results",
    ", we also perform the spin - polarized gga calculations for the purpose of comparison .",
    "the pdos of in@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 for g1(g2)-type afm state is shown in fig .",
    "it is found that the system is an insulator with an energy gap of 0.4 ev .",
    "however the calculated magnetic moment is only 0.4 @xmath43 , smaller than that observed by the experiment , about 0.5 @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "considering the fact that the lsda results usually overestimate the magnitude of a magnetic moment , while the experimental results underestimate it due to the significant disorder and fluctuations in realistic compounds , one can expect that there exists a larger magnetic moment than 0.5 @xmath43 . in a similar system cu@xmath1v@xmath1o@xmath44 with 0.73 @xmath43 for @xmath19= 6.52 ev @xcite ,",
    "the gga+@xmath18 calculations are also needed for in@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 .",
    "we choose the coulomb parameters lying in a physical parameter range for in@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 , _ i.e. _ @xmath19= 8 ev for cu ions , and 4 ev for v ions according to the similar compounds , such as cu@xmath1v@xmath1o@xmath44 @xcite and in@xmath1vo@xmath45 @xcite , as well as the general compounds , such as cuprates and vanadium oxides ( v@xmath1o@xmath0 @xcite ) , _",
    "etc._. notice that we perform the numerical calculations for several different coulomb parameters for cu and v atoms to systematically investigate their influence on our results , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath19= 6 @xmath46 8 ev for cu @xcite and @xmath19= 3 @xmath46 5 ev for v @xcite . from our numerical calculations",
    ", we find that the band gap and the magnetic moment vary from 1.37 to 1.5 ev and from 0.72 to 0.79 @xmath43 , respectively , when u@xmath47 changes from 6 to 8 ev for cu and from 3 to 5 ev for v. this clearly shows that the electronic and magnetic properties do not crucially depend on the values of the parameter u in the physical range .    to further uncover the insulating character of in@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 , the pdos for g1(or g2)-type afm state by the gga+@xmath18 approach is plotted , as seen in fig .",
    "the system is obviously an insulator with an energy gap of 1.5 ev .",
    "we found that oxygen 2@xmath5 orbitals consist of the major bands near @xmath7 , ranging from 0 to @xmath174.0 ev . while the gravity center of cu 3@xmath6 orbitals lie far from @xmath7 .",
    "the center of the spin - up 3@xmath6 orbital lies at about @xmath175.9 ev , and that of the spin - down 3@xmath6 orbitals lies at about @xmath174.8 ev .",
    "this gives rise to the exchange splitting of cu 3@xmath6 orbitals about @xmath48 @xmath9 1.1 ev , implying that the hund s rule coupling @xmath21 = @xmath49 @xmath9 1.1 ev . such a large exchange splitting also shows a strong coulomb correlation on cu 3@xmath6 orbitals .",
    "note that the charge transfer energy between o 2@xmath5 orbital and cu 3@xmath6 orbital in in@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 , @xmath50 = @xmath51 , which has the same order as the insulating energy gap , is considerably smaller than the on - site coulomb interaction of cu 3@xmath6 electrons , demonstrating that in@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 is a charge transfer insulator .",
    "the charge distribution and occupation numbers in the 3@xmath6 orbitals of cu and v are essential to understand the electronic properties of in@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 .",
    "our results show that in the cu 3@xmath6 orbitals , the hole mainly occupies the active @xmath52 orbital .",
    "it has a total number of 1.17 electrons , or 0.83 holes , in the @xmath52 orbital . in contrary to the chemical valence analysis",
    ", v has totally 1.87 electrons in its 3@xmath6 orbitals , though it shows nm or no spin polarization in the present gga+@xmath18 ansatz .",
    "this arises from a strong @xmath5-@xmath6 hybridization between v and o atoms , and a fraction of electrons transfer from oxygen 2@xmath5 orbitals to vanadium 3@xmath6 orbitals . fig .",
    "5 displays that the main dos of copper lies from @xmath177 ev to @xmath174 ev , though a tiny portion of 3@xmath6 electrons lie between @xmath174 ev to @xmath7 which arises mainly from the hybridization of cu 3@xmath6 orbital with the 2@xmath5 orbitals near @xmath7 of surrounding o anions .",
    "it s observed from fig .",
    "5 that the 3@xmath52 orbital in cu is almost fully spin polarized .",
    "the magnetic moment of cu spin is almost contributed from the well localized spin - up 3@xmath52 orbital at the position of about 7 ev below @xmath7 .",
    "we find that the orbital ground state is the cu 3@xmath52 character , in agreement with the electron spin resonance experiment by kataev _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , a small but finite dos distributed from @xmath176 ev to @xmath7 is seen in v 3@xmath6 orbitals , showing that the two 3@xmath6 electrons form a wide energy band below the fermi energy .",
    "obviously , other v 3@xmath6 electrons contribute the highest empty conduction bands , as we see in fig .",
    "the pdos of v shows that two 3@xmath6 electrons in v are not spin polarized and allocate in five 3@xmath6 orbitals with almost equal weight , in sharp contrast to those of cu atoms .",
    "5 shows that in 5@xmath5 orbitals give rise to a small dos in a wide energy range .",
    "in contrast , the dos of oxygen mainly distributes near @xmath7 and is greatly larger than that of in .",
    "such a strongly correlated character in in@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 is similar to that in the parent phases of high - t@xmath53 cuprates .",
    "this implies that the doping in o sites can readily affect the transport properties in in@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 , and easily drive the system transit to metallic or superconducting phase once hole carriers are doped in oxygen 2@xmath5 bands .",
    "the groundstate magnetic properties of in@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 is the central issue of this paper . as described above",
    ", our numerical results demonstrate that the stablest phase is the degenerate g1- and g2-type afm states .",
    "the magnetic moment mainly contributes from copper spins with a total net magnetic moment of 0.79 @xmath43 per cu atom in which the average electron number is 0.98 in the spin - up band , and 0.19 in the spin - down one .",
    "the magnetic moment mainly arises from the @xmath52 orbital of copper . apparently , a strong electron correlation and a large hund s rule coupling result in such a large spin polarization , leading to a well defined local moment in coppers . in contrast , vanadium is nm , though it is 3@xmath54 configuration with two electrons distributing from @xmath7 to @xmath177.0 ev .",
    "its nm character may arise from the strong _ p - d _ hybridization between v and o , resulting in a weak correlation between v 3@xmath6 electrons .",
    "we do not rule out the possibility of spin frustrations in the present cu - v geometry , which may deserve further discussion in the future .",
    "due to the full fillings of the oxygen 2@xmath5 orbitals and in 5@xmath5 orbitals , both o and in are not spin polarized .",
    "the insulating nature in in@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 suggests that the local spins of coppers interact through a superexchange couplings mediated via oxygens and vanadium .",
    "one expects that the contributions to the nn and nnn cu - cu superexchange couplings arise from the direct hopping between @xmath28 electrons , the indirect hopping between cu spins through the @xmath5-@xmath6 hybridization of intermediate oxygen anions and through the o - v - o bridge .",
    "to quantitatively obtain the superxchange coupling strengths , we utilize the tight - binding parameters obtained in table i to estimate the nn and nnn superexchange couplings between cu spins in the cu / v - o plane and between the planes , taking the effective coulomb interaction @xmath18 as 8 ev .",
    "a @xmath55/@xmath18 expansion of the hubbard model is used to obtain an effective @xmath8-@xmath10-@xmath56 spin @xmath4=1/2 model on a honeycomb lattice : @xmath57 where @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the nn , nnn intralayer and the nn interlayer magnetic couplings , respectively .",
    "we find that the intraplane and interplane nn superexchange couplings are about @xmath61 16.2 mev and @xmath62 1.2 mev , respectively ; and the intraplane nnn superexchange couplings are about @xmath63 0.3 mev .",
    "more long - range spin couplings are so small to be negligible .",
    "this gives rise to @xmath10/@xmath8 @xmath9 0.02 , in addition to a rather weak interlayer coupling of @xmath56/@xmath8 @xmath9 0.07 .",
    "all of these spin coupling strengths have been listed in table i. from the literature available , we find that the spin coupling strengths of in@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 fall in the parameter range of a 2d heisenberg afm @xcite , showing that in@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 is an insulator with 2d afm . as we will illustrate later , such a weak interlayer magnetic coupling and the spin frustration prevent from the long - range afm order in in@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 .",
    "it is observed experimentally that neither the specific heat nor magnetic susceptibility exhibits afm - pm transition @xcite : the former is almost t@xmath64 dependent , and the latter linearly increases with the lift of temperature .",
    "consequently , one naturally suspects that the ground state of in@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 might be a gapless spin liquid phase , a long - time searched exotic quantum phase both theoretically and experimentally , since such a phase in _",
    "kagome _ lattice also demonstrates similar unusual temperature - dependent behavior in the low t regime @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , a strongly low - d afm may exhibit similar behaviors @xcite . though both a low - dimensional afm and a spin liquid have local permanent magnetic moments , and do not display any sign of ordering in specific heat and magnetic susceptibility down to the lowest temperatures despite of comparable strong afm interactions .",
    "a low - dimensional afm could be different from a spin liquid in many aspects .",
    "for example , a 2d afm has a long - range correlation and long - range order at t= 0 k as well as short - range one at finite t , while a spin liquid only has short - range correlation , even at t= 0 k ; this leads to distinct low - temperature behavior in magnetic susceptibility for a 2d afm and a spin liquid , _ etc._. therefore our theoretical analysis above suggests 2d afm ground state rather than a spin liquid , though it is still mysterious why in@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 exhibits neither an afm long - range order in the low temperature regime nor a curie - weiss law in the high temperature regime @xcite , which is exotic and distinctly different from undoped cuprates .",
    "an earlier experimental study by m@xmath65ller _",
    "_ @xcite attributed the absence of a 3d afm long - range order to the disorder stacking of 2d cu@xmath66v order domains along the @xmath12-axis .",
    "however , from our preceding data and the particular geometry of in@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 , as an alternative explanation , we propose that it is the strong afm frustration along the @xmath12-axis leads to the absence of the 3d afm long - range order in in@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 . as seen the cu - v geometric configuration among two cu - v layers in fig .",
    "6 ,    a cu spin has two nn layers along the @xmath12-axis , it has the same distance to other two cu spins in the upper or lower layer , forming an isosceles triangle which is a notorious spin configuration with magnetic frustration .",
    "our analysis above has shown that both the spin couplings of the interlayer and intralayer spins are afm , indicating the spin fluctuations along the @xmath12-axis will be very large .",
    "thus in in@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 the intralayer cu spins are afm correlated , while the interlayer cu spins are quantum disordered .",
    "such a frustration scenario could unifiedly account for both the presence of low - d afm correlation @xcite and the absence of 3d afm order @xcite in recent experiments .",
    "furthermore , we apply our frustration scenario to uncover the evolution of the magnetic properties on the co and zn dopings in in@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 , giving a possible explanation of the experimental behavior , as shown in fig .",
    "the zn and co dopings break the inter - layer frustration , while the nm zn@xmath67 ions destroy the intra - layer afm . on the contrary ,",
    "high spin-3/2 co@xmath67 ions enhance it .",
    "thus the zn doping induces a weak afm at low doping , but suppresses the afm state completely at high doping . in comparison , the co doping results in a strong afm with large effective magnetic moment .",
    "all the results are in accordance with the experimental observations .    moreover , as we point out above",
    ", the hole doping in o sites of in@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 may introduce carriers near fermi energy . with the increase of carriers ,",
    "one expects that the screening effect can greatly reduce the coulomb interaction , and weaken the electronic correlation .",
    "this may drive the in@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 system from an afm ground state to a spin liquid phase @xcite , since in the intermediate correlation regime , a half - filled hubbard system with the honeycomb structure exists a spin - liquid ground state @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we do nt expect that doped in@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 will form the well - known zhang - rice singlet in the cu - o plane of cuprates , since the latter arises from the hybridization between cu 3@xmath68 and o 2@xmath5 orbitals , forming delocalized states in the xy plane ; while in the former , the 3@xmath52 orbital mixes with o 2@xmath5 orbital , forming a delocalized state in the @xmath69-direction .",
    "this results in completely different transport properties in doped compounds , as yan _",
    "et al . _ observed in in@xmath0cu@xmath70co@xmath71vo@xmath2 and in@xmath0cu@xmath70zn@xmath71vo@xmath2 @xcite .    in summary",
    ", the investigation of the electronic structure and magnetic properties in quasi-2d honeycomb compound in@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 demonstrates that the undoped phase is a charge transfer insulator with a gap of 1.5 ev , and oxygen 2@xmath5 orbitals dominate the bands near @xmath7 .",
    "spin-1/2 local moment antiferromagnetically interacts and occupies the 3@xmath72-@xmath73 orbital in copper .",
    "in contrast , the nm v ions have two electrons in the 3@xmath6 orbitals . the tight - binding parameters and estimated spin coupling strengths suggest that in@xmath0cu@xmath1vo@xmath2 is a strongly 2d _ nel _ afm .",
    "we propose that the spin fluctuations arising from the magnetic frustration along the @xmath12-axis destroy the 3d afm long - range order , leading to random stacking of cu - v layers .",
