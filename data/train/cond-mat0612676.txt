    "the electronic structure of the high - temperature ( high - t@xmath14 ) superconductors continues to remain a challenging topic in the physics of strongly correlated transition metal oxides .",
    "recent studies have elucidated important features involving electron - phonon coupling and charge - order @xcite , as well as two dimensionality of the magnetic excitations in the high - t@xmath14 cuprates @xcite .",
    "the zhang - rice singlet ( zrs ) , is a basic starting point for understanding the electronic structure of the cuprates .",
    "the zrs was originally postulated @xcite for a doped hole distributed over the oxygen sites in a cuo@xmath15 plaquette , which gets bound to the cu@xmath10 ( @xmath16 ) state and forms a singlet due to cu - o hybridization .",
    "it is the lowest energy electron removal state .",
    "since a photoemission process also removes an electron ( adds a hole ) , it was nicely shown that the zrs can be probed by valence band photoemission spectroscopy even for insulating copper oxides @xcite .",
    "polarization dependent @xcite and spin - resolved @xcite valence band photoemission have established the zrs feature as the lowest energy state in insulating and superconducting copper oxides .",
    "it was also predicted that cu @xmath0 core - level photoemission spectra should exhibit a low binding energy feature derived from the zrs , even for the parent insulating la@xmath8cuo@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "while the theoretical prediction was made very early , only recent studies with hard x - ray photoemission spectroscopy ( hx - pes ) could identify the zrs feature in the cu @xmath0 core - level spectra of the parent la@xmath8cuo@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "hx - pes has developed significantly in the last few years @xcite mainly due to its ability to overcome the high - surface sensitivity of conventional photoemission spectroscopy .",
    "hx - pes results in much higher kinetic energies of emitted electrons and hence longer mean free paths ( typically 50 - 150 @xmath17 ) , naturally leading to bulk - sensitive measurements @xcite . its application",
    "to strongly correlated systems has led to several significant results , making it an fundamental technique to reveal the true bulk electronic structure @xcite . in the last few years , we have reported bulk sensitive hx - pes with @xmath18=5.95 kev of transition metal ( tm ) @xmath0 core - level for various tm compounds ( pure and cr doped v@xmath4o@xmath19 @xcite , hole - doped lamno@xmath19 ( lsmo , lbmo ) @xcite and high - tc cuprates @xcite ) . unlike conventional soft x - ray ( sx ) pes , tm @xmath0 core - level hx - pes spectra have shown additional well - screened satellites with significantly large intensity in addition to @xmath20 and @xmath21 features , where @xmath22 represents a ligand hole .",
    "these satellites were located at an energy position few ev lower in binding energy than the @xmath23 and @xmath24 main line , respectively .    in the case of",
    "pure and cr doped v@xmath4o@xmath19 , clear changes in v @xmath0 hx - pes were observed across the metal - insulator ( mott - hubbard ) transition @xcite .",
    "the structure and position of the main peak and the high and low binding energy satellite structures were explained well by the cluster model including intra - atomic multiplet structure and a metallic screening channel derived from coherent states at the fermi energy .",
    "the low binding energy satellite structure was attributed to the screening from the coherent state at the fermi level .",
    "this has been independently confirmed by direct measurements of the valence band coherent feature and core - level spectra of v@xmath4o@xmath19 @xcite .",
    "a similar interpretation based on a mott - hubbard transition has been used to explain the ru @xmath25 core - level spectra for a series of ru oxides @xcite .    for hole - doped lamno@xmath19 ,",
    "a similar well - screened low binding energy feature in mn @xmath0 spectra was observed @xcite .",
    "the feature showed a noticeable increase with decreasing temperature on entering the ferromagnetic metal phase , indicating that the origin of this feature is strongly related to the ferromagnetic metal phase @xcite .",
    "new features at low binding energy are also seen in high - t@xmath14 cuprates @xcite .",
    "but its spectral shape is quite different in electron - doped nd@xmath26ce@xmath27cuo@xmath3 ( ncco ) and hole - doped la@xmath26sr@xmath27cuo@xmath3 ( lsco ) systems .",
    "it was clearly shown that lsco and ncco exhibit new bulk character electronic states , which are strongly suppressed in the surface .    a recent theoretical study @xcite offers an alternative interpretation for well - screened features in the cu @xmath0 , mn @xmath0 , and ru @xmath25 core - level spectra based on a non - local screening scenario with doping , magnetic and orbital ordering for the cuprates , manganites and ruthenates , respectively .",
    "we believe in so far as the additional screening channel is required to explain the low binding energy feature , our picture is not different from ref .  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we believe the non - local screening channel in the multi - site cluster model @xcite would develop into quasiparticle states at the fermi level ( @xmath28 ) as obtained in dynamical mean - field theory calculations @xcite . in the spirit of the non - local screening channel or screening from quasiparticle states at @xmath28 , we have used a single - site cluster model @xcite , with the screening from the states at @xmath28 but also including intra - site multiplets which are necessary for the observed structure in the core - level spectra .    in a previous study ,",
    "we have presented results of cu @xmath0 hx - pes for bi@xmath4sr@xmath8cacu@xmath8o@xmath9 ( bi2212 ) @xcite .",
    "we found that the spectral weight in the @xmath29 binding energy satellite increases considerably in hx - pes compared with sx - pes results .",
    "this enhancement of the satellite intensity in bi2212 is quite different as opposed to the other tm compounds mentioned above .",
    "v@xmath4o@xmath19 , lsmo and ncco have shown huge changes at the @xmath30 binding energy to the main peak , but bi2212 shows a change in the @xmath31 binding energy satellite .",
    "this fact would naively indicate an increase of @xmath32 weight in the bulk since the satellite is generally assigned to the @xmath33 state .",
    "the fitted parameter values indicated that hybridization strength was reduced in the bulk sensitive hx - pes as against the surface sensitive sx - pes .",
    "as previously mentioned @xcite , a decrease of the hybridization strength in the bulk is surprising . in general , the different atomic environment and reduced co - ordination , often conspire to reduce hybridizations and screenings at the surface .    in order to shed new light on the above - mentioned problem , we extend our previous work to study the cu - o layer - dependence , doping dependence and photon energy dependence by using hx - pes .",
    "we report the cu @xmath0 core - level spectra in single layer la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 ( lsco , @xmath34 = 0.0 , 0.145 and 0.26 ) , la doped bi@xmath4sr@xmath5la@xmath6cuo@xmath7 ( bi2201 ) and bilayer bi2212 .",
    "our main purpose is to resolve the puzzling observation of increase in the spectral intensity of the @xmath32 satellite in bi2212 by comparative measurements . from x - ray photon",
    "energy dependent measurements , the results show that the increased intensity in the satellite region is associated with bi @xmath13 core - level spectral intensity , which is usually neglected in sx - pes measurements .",
    "the corrected @xmath12 satellite intensity is independent of the doping content or number of cu - o layers .",
    "the results suggest a correlation of the relative intensities of the zrs feature and the hole - doping induced high binding energy spectral changes in the main peak with superconductivity .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows .",
    "the experimental details are briefly described in sec .",
    "the results and discussion on cu - o layer dependence , doping dependence , and photon energy dependence are given in sec .",
    "conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "hx - pes measurements were performed in a vacuum of 1 @xmath35 10@xmath36 torr at undulator beam line bl29xu , spring-8 @xcite using a scienta r4000 - 10kv electron analyzer .",
    "the instrumentation details are described in ref .",
    "the energy width of incident x - ray was 70 mev , and the total energy resolution , @xmath37e was set to @xmath38 0.4 ev . all spectra were corrected by subtracting a shirley - type background .",
    "sample temperature was controlled to @xmath39k during measurements .",
    "single crystal bi2212 and bi2201 were peeled with a scotch tape and measured at 30 k. the lsco samples were measured for surfaces fractured @xmath40-@xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath34 = 0.0 composition was measured at room temperature to avoid charging while the metallic compositions ( @xmath34 = 0.145 and 0.26 ) were measured at 30 k. a reference measurement on a metallic bi - based non - cuprate oxides ba@xmath42k@xmath43bio@xmath19 ( bkbo ) was measured at 30 k for an @xmath40-@xmath41 fractured surface .",

    "the line is fit to the bi @xmath13 hx - pes data as explained in the text .",
    "( b ) cu @xmath0 core - level hx - pes spectra of bi2212 and bi2201 with a photon energy @xmath45 kev .",
    "all cu @xmath0 spectra were corrected by subtracting a shirley - type background . ]",
    "in fig .  1(a ) we present the cu @xmath0 core - level hx - pes spectra of bi2212 and bi2201 with photon energy @xmath44 kev .",
    "the spectrum of bi2212 is consistent with our previous report @xcite .",
    "it consists of two prominent sets of structures and the main peaks at @xmath38 934 and 953 ev , separated by approximately 19 ev , originating from the spin - orbit splitting of the @xmath0 core - level , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "each prominent structure itself consists of two peaks , main peak ( @xmath46 state ) and satellite ( @xmath33 state ) nearly 7 ev above two main peaks .",
    "the spectral weight in the high binding energy satellite of @xmath23 at 940 ev is significantly higher in hx - pes as compared with the previous sx - pes @xcite and basically no change is seen over the @xmath24 satellite energy range . in the previous paper @xcite , we had carried out the cluster model calculation of cu @xmath0 hx - pes for bi2212 . to obtain the significant increase in the satellite intensity at 940 ev ,",
    "a reduced hybridization strength was needed ( by a factor of @xmath47 ) compared to that in the sx - pes , implying a decrease of the hybridization strength in the bulk . since a smaller hybridization",
    "is expected on the surface compared to that in the bulk , this fact is quite unusual .    from a comparison between bi2212 and bi2201",
    ", we found that the satellite intensity of bi2201 is higher than that of bi2212 , as shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) . even more surprisingly , its relative weight is almost comparable to the main line .",
    "this huge enhancement can not be explained by the reduced hybridization in the bulk .",
    "thus , we are led to another possibility for elucidating our observations .",
    "one possibility would be the photo - ionization cross section effect of bi @xmath13 core - level , because the binding energy of bi @xmath13 core - level is very close to the @xmath33 satellite energy of @xmath23 .",
    "the bi @xmath13 contribution in cu @xmath0 core - level spectra of the bi - based cuprates is generally neglected .",
    "this is a good approximation , because the small bi @xmath13 photo - ionization cross section leads to negligible intensity as far as the sx - pes is concerned .",
    "in fact , the cross section ratio @xmath48 in soft x - ray region is at most @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "the increase of the x - ray photon energy will give an increase of the cross section ratio @xmath48 .",
    "the @xmath50 ratio is very large and is approximately 1 in hard x - ray region .",
    "this means that bi @xmath13 contribution can by no means be neglected .",
    "moreover , the composition ratio of bi : cu is 2:2 for bi2212 . thus , we expect comparable contributions from the bi @xmath13 core - level respect to the cu @xmath0 spectra and was overlooked by us in the previous study .",
    "the considerable enhancement of the satellite intensity of bi2201 with respect to bi2212 can be similarly understood by comparing the composition ratio between bi2201 and bi2212 .",
    "the composition ratio of bi : cu is 2:1 for bi2201 and consequently , the relative contribution from the bi @xmath13 is enhanced by a factor of 2 with respect to bi2212 .    since , with further increase of the x - ray photon energy , the photo - ionization cross section ratio @xmath50 increases further , we expect the satellite intensity to be increased with higher value of @xmath18 compared to @xmath44 kev photon energy . to confirm this , we performed hx - pes measurements by using 7.93 kev x - ray photon energy . figure  1(b ) shows the cu @xmath0 core - level hx - pes spectra for bi2212 and bi2201 using photon energy @xmath45 kev .",
    "again , the intensities at 940 ev for both bi2212 and bi2201 are clearly enhanced and they are much stronger than those with @xmath44 kev , as we expected . in particular , for bi2201 , the intensity in the satellite region exceeds that of the main line and the satellite peak dominates over the main peak , confirming the bi 4s contribution .    to correct for the bi @xmath13 contribution in the cu @xmath0 hx - pes spectra of the b - based cuprates",
    ", we measured the bi @xmath13 core - level data taken from a single crystal bkbo in fig .",
    "1(a ) . since the measured signal - to - noise",
    "( s / n ) ratio of bkbo spectrum is not sufficient for the present correction procedure , the bi @xmath13 spectrum of bkbo was fitted with a lorenztian ( hwhm=4 ev ) .",
    "the result of the fit is illustrated by a line in fig .",
    "this lorenztian line shape was used to fit the cu @xmath0 hx - pes spectra for bi2212 and bi2201 with @xmath44 kev .",
    "then , we obtained the cu @xmath0 line shape by subtracting the best fit to the bi @xmath13 component , the only free parameter being the intensity ratio . figure  2(a ) shows the corrected cu @xmath23 hx - pes spectra of bi2212 and bi2201 compared with sx - pes data .",
    "thus , satisfactory corrections were obtained by subtracting the bi @xmath13 signal .",
    "the obtained ratio of the integrated intensities of the subtracted bi @xmath13 lorenztian contribution between bi2212 and bi2201 is 1:2 , which is consistent with the relative bi contribution between two materials .",
    "the resulting cu @xmath0 hx - pes for bi2212 and bi2201 are quite similar to those of sx - pes for bi2212 .",
    "( color online ) ( a ) comparison between experimental cu @xmath23 sx - pes from ref .",
    "@xcite and cu @xmath23 hx - pes after subtracting bi @xmath13 contribution .",
    "( b ) difference between cu @xmath0 hx - pes spectra of bi2201 and that of bi2212 .",
    "the dip feature at 931 ev is the zrs feature .",
    "the broad low intensity feature at higher binding energy is due to the poor s / n ratio in the bi2201 spectrum . ]",
    "( color online ) ( a ) cu @xmath23 hx - pes spectra of la@xmath1sr@xmath51cuo@xmath15 for several doping with a photon energy @xmath44 kev .",
    "( b ) difference spectra between several cu @xmath23 hx - pes spectra and reference spectrum of lco . ]    having subtracted the bi @xmath13 contribution , we now concentrate on the detailed structure in the main peak of cu @xmath23 . the bi2212 spectrum [ fig .",
    "2(a ) ] shows clear changes compared to bi2201 and the additional spectral weight is seen at the lower binding energy ( nearly 931 ev ) .",
    "this is particularly evidenced well by the difference spectra between bi2201 and bi2212 in fig .",
    "2(b ) . using the multi - site cluster model @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the cu @xmath0 spectrum has a low binding energy zrs feature due to the non - local screening .",
    "thus , this feature is assigned to the zrs feature , indicating that the zrs feature is enhanced in the bilayer bi2212 compared to the single layer bi2201 .      in order to better understand the character of the main line , we resort to a comparison with the lsco cu @xmath0 spectra obtained with hx - pes .",
    "cu @xmath23 hx - pes spectra of lsco as a function of doping are shown in fig .",
    "the spectra of lsco with @xmath34 = 0.0 and 0.145 are the same as those of our previous report @xcite .",
    "we observed a systematic change in spectral shape on hole - doping . to see these spectral features",
    "clearly we plot the difference spectra with respect to the lco reference spectrum in fig .",
    "the observed spectral changes in our data are consistent with previous works on the yba@xmath4cu@xmath19o@xmath52 @xcite .",
    "the shoulder at lower energy to the main peak @xmath46 in lsco can again be similarly attributed to the zrs feature , consistent with earlier work @xcite . as discussed in our earlier study , the zrs peak in @xmath34",
    "= 0.0 occurs at the lower binding energy to the @xmath46 state .",
    "the spectral intensity in the zrs feature reduces on increasing @xmath34 from @xmath34 = 0.0 to 0.145 , but does not change for @xmath34 = 0.26 .    note",
    "that fig .",
    "3(a ) shows another feature , @xmath53 , a broad feature centered at 934.5 ev ( feature @xmath54 ) which is enhanced as the hole - doping increases .",
    "in contrast to the zrs feature , the feature @xmath54 grows with increasing @xmath34 up to @xmath34 = 0.26 .",
    "we suggest two possible explanations for this broad feature @xmath54 . in lsco , since we dope holes due to sr content @xmath34 , it can lead to the cu@xmath55 character state which grows with doping .",
    "another possible explanation is the non - local screening effects .",
    "very recently , okada and kotani developed the multi - site cluster model calculation for the doping dependence @xcite and a similar enhancement as observed for the high binding energy feature was already apparent in their calculation .",
    "however the relation of non - local screening effects with cu@xmath55 configurations is not clear .",
    "we can not conclude from our experiments alone if the feature @xmath54 reflects the non - local screening effect or simply an increase in cu@xmath55 configurations with hole - doping , or a coupling of both effects .",
    "a comparison of lsco spectra indicates that the zrs feature intensity between @xmath34 = 0.145 ( t@xmath14=36 k ) and 0.26 ( non superconducting ) does not change much but the intensity of the feature @xmath54 beyond optimal doping increases . in terms of its superconducting @xmath56",
    ", it then suggests that an increase in the feature @xmath54 content is primarily responsible for the reduction in @xmath56 .",
    "on the other hand , for bi2201 ( @xmath56=28 k ) and bi2212 ( @xmath56=90 k ) , the high binding energy feature does not seem to change while the zrs feature shows a small but definite increase in intensity for bi2212 .",
    "this suggests that the retention or increase of the zrs feature is more important for higher tc in the hole doped cuprates .",
    "in conclusion , the aim of the present paper has been to understand the origin of the experimentally observed satellite at 940 ev in cu @xmath0 hx - pes of bi based high - t@xmath14 superconductors and in particular their evolution with x - ray photon energy and the composition change .",
    "we investigated the photon energy dependence of the cu @xmath0 core - level photoemission spectra for bi2212 and bi2201 by using hard x - ray photon energy .",
    "we exploited the sensitivity of the relative photo - ionization cross section to clarify the bi @xmath13 contribution from the measured cu @xmath0 hx - pes spectra .",
    "the results from bi based cuprates can be interpreted satisfactorily only by including the bi @xmath13 core - level contribution .",
    "thus the observed enhancement of the satellite is then due to the increase of the photo - ionization cross section of bi @xmath13 core - level rather than the reduction of the hybridization strength in the bulk .",
    "the corrected spectra lead to a systematic picture on the basis of the doping dependence and cu - o layers dependence of zrs feature and hole - doping induced high binding energy spectral changes in the main cu @xmath0 core - level line .",
    "the hx - pes experiments reported here have benefited tremendously from the efforts of dr .",
