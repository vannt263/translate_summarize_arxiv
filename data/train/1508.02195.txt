    "* ) , especially given its simplicity : it has no shape parameters .",
    "however , a closer examination of the profile shapes of relaxed halos shows that nfw does not fully capture the density run .",
    "most importantly , while the nfw profile has a central density cusp , with logarithmic slope @xmath4 , recent high resolution simulations have shown that the central cusp tends to become somewhat shallower at smaller and smaller radii ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , prompting the use of an einasto @xmath1-model @xcite .",
    "the einasto profile fits halos better at most radii , not just in the center , suggesting that the additional parameter @xmath1 is a real characteristic of dark matter halos @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that the mean value of @xmath1 ranges from about 0.17 for @xmath5 @xmath6 m@xmath7 halos to @xmath8 at @xmath9 @xmath6 m@xmath7 , which is consistent with @xcite who find a relation between einasto s @xmath1 and the ratio of the linear density threshold for collapse to the rms linear density fluctuation at a given mass scale .",
    "in addition to the mass - dependent @xmath1 , there is significant scatter of around @xmath10 in @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , halos with @xmath1 in the range @xmath10 to @xmath11 are also realized in simulations @xcite .",
    "these works show that the shape of the density profile , including the central logarithmic slope , is tied to the initial conditions and evolutionary history of the halos in simulations .",
    "@xcite suggest that the mass profiles of halos reflect their accretion history .",
    "the spread in @xmath1 index is observed not just for main halos , but also subhalos .",
    "@xcite find that the profiles of subhalos do not converge to a central power law but exhibit curving shapes well described by the einasto form with @xmath1 in the range @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "this is consistent with the findings of @xcite , who note that simulated satellite dark matter halos around galaxies are better fit with einasto profiles of index @xmath14 .",
    "@xcite find a correlation between @xmath15 ( ranging from 0.1 to 1 ) and satellite dark matter halo mass , i.e. , with higher masses corresponding to smaller values of @xmath1 , contrary to the trend found for more massive halos .",
    "the diversity in the density profiles of these satellites is attributed to tidal stripping , which acts mainly in the outer parts of the subhaloes .",
    "the conclusion is that simulated dark matter halos do not form a strictly self - similar family of systems as was originally suggested , but display non - universality @xcite .",
    "neither nfw nor einasto have any theoretical underpinnings ; they are purely empirical . in a series of papers @xcite",
    "we have proposed a theoretically based model , darkexp , which has been shown to allow good fits to a few simulated halos @xcite and observed galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "darkexp has one shape parameter , and its density profiles are very similar to einasto within a limited range of shape parameters . taking the broader range of achievable values into account , darkexp suggests that there should be a dispersion in the shapes of the density profiles between systems , parametrized by the shape parameter . at small radii , but sufficiently above the resolution limit achieved in cosmological simulations , these density profiles differ significantly . some have nearly flat cores , while others are steep , @xmath16 . in other words ,",
    "unless halos have identical normalized central potentials , darkexp predicts that the density profiles should not be universal , and that a logarithmic slope of @xmath17 at small radii robustly resolved in simulations is not a universal attractor of halos with different formation histories .",
    "testing this would be important because darkexp is not a fitting function but is derived from basic physics .",
    "we summarize the rationale and properties of darkexp in section  [ darkexp ] .",
    "while darkexp has the advantage of being derived from first principles , the resulting density profiles unfortunately can not be expressed analytically .",
    "we therefore also relate the properties of darkexp to those of phenomenological fitting functions , i.e. , generalized hernquist , dehnen ",
    "tremaine , and einasto models .",
    "we discuss non - universality of simulated and observed massive dark - matter halos in section 3 and show that , in cases where exact fits are not required , darkexp , einasto , or dehnen  tremaine profiles provide equally good representations , with considerable dispersion in their respective shape parameters .",
    "we relate observed , simulated and theoretical properties of lower mass halos in section  4 and conclude in section  5",
    "darkexp is a theoretical model for the differential energy distribution in a self - gravitating collisionless system .",
    "specifically , defining @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the normalized absolute particle energy per unit mass , a statistical mechanical analysis leads to @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the central dimensionless potential , @xmath2 , is the only free shape parameter of the model .",
    "some of the global properties of the model are analytic ( see appendix a ) , while the phase space distribution function and derived properties , such as the density profile , must be obtained numerically using an iterative procedure @xcite . apart from the assumption of isotropy ( which leads to spherical structures ) ,",
    "there are no additional assumptions involved in this computation .",
    "the scale parameters of the corresponding density profile follow from the resulting profiles themselves .",
    "darkexp is a maximum entropy theory and as such describes only the final , equilibrium states of systems , and not the evolutionary paths that brought them to the final state .",
    "the density profiles apply to isolated systems , i.e. , there is no cosmological context and so no concept of a virial radius or formation redshift .",
    "while the asymptotic logarithmic density slope is @xmath17 for @xmath21 @xcite , in reality the central logarithmic slope robustly resolved in simulations depends on @xmath2 : @xmath22 systems have inner logarithmic slopes shallower than @xmath17 , while @xmath23 have inner logarithmic slopes between @xmath17 and @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "darkexp was not designed to fit the properties of dark - matter structures . nevertheless , the energy distributions resulting from this first principles derivation are excellent representations of numerical simulations and the density profiles are reminiscent of einasto @xmath1 profiles for values of @xmath2 around 4 @xcite .",
    "note that in the @xcite formalism , the darkexp density run is independent of any velocity anisotropy .",
    "darkexp also provides very good fits to observed galaxy clusters @xcite , and globular clusters @xcite .",
    "we here compare darkexp to phenomenological fitting functions , notably the generalized hernquist , the special case of the dehnen ",
    "tremaine @xmath25model , and the einasto profile ( see appendix b for details).10 available for download at the darkexp website http://www.dark - cosmology.dk / darkexp/. ] we provide the correspondence between the shape parameters of these analytic fitting functions and the dimensionless parameter of darkexp , @xmath2 . these results can be used in any situation where fitting with darkexp is required .    by construction ,",
    "the darkexp energy distribution is discontinuous at the escape energy , and as a consequence the density falls off as @xmath26 at large radii @xcite . when searching for phenomenological or analytical profiles that may be useful approximations to darkexp , we recall that the generalized @xcite model has the same outer logarithmic slope of @xmath27 as darkexp , and also allows for a range of central logarithmic slopes , @xmath28 where @xmath29 governs the sharpness of the transition between the asymptotic inner logarithmic slope of @xmath30 and the outer logarithmic slope of @xmath27 . for @xmath31 the resulting @xmath3-models ,",
    "@xmath32 are largely analytical @xcite .",

    "we find an einasto model or @xmath3-model that matches darkexp ( i.e. , has the same value as darkexp ) in either density or log  log density slope . the anchor radius at which the matching is done is chosen to be @xmath35 , which is the typical resolution limit in cosmological simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we choose to anchor the profiles at a fixed radius rather than fitting the ( log ) density or slope as a function of ( log ) radius , over some range , for visual clarity .",
    "figure  [ phi0-gamma ] summarizes the results of the matching between darkexp and phenomenological models .",
    "it shows the relations between @xmath2 and either @xmath3 or @xmath1 , matched in either density or logarithmic slope .",
    "we also provide analytical approximations to these relations . for the @xmath3-model @xmath36 which suggests @xmath37 for @xmath38 . for the einasto model @xmath39 and @xmath40 for @xmath41 .",

    "density slope relation in the following sections .",
    "until about 510 years ago simulation results were consistent with halos being universal in shape .",
    "now , there is considerable evidence to the contrary .",
    "how does the darkexp expectation of non - universality compare to simulations ?",
    "we here analyze recent simulations , show that darkexp fits the density profiles at least as well as einasto , and quantify the non - universality .",
    "we use cluster halos identified in the bolshoi simulation , a dark matter - only simulation run in a @xmath42 box ( wmap5 cosmological parameters ) with @xmath43 particles , which corresponds to a mass resolution of @xmath44 ( for more details , see * ? ? ?",
    "for the purpose of our analysis , we select well - resolved equilibrium halos with at least @xmath45 particles within the virial radius @xmath46 ( defined as the radius of a sphere , whose enclosed density is @xmath47 times larger then the background density ) .",
    "the state of equilibrium is assessed using two diagnostics : the virial ratio and the relative offset between the minimum of the potential and the halo mass center .",
    "we find @xmath48 equilibrium halos defined by the virial ratio less than @xmath49 and the mass center offset less than @xmath50 , which are two commonly used relaxation criteria proposed by @xcite .",
    "this selection is done in order to make a meaningful comparison with darkexp , which by definition only applies to equilibrium systems .",
    "we calculate the density profiles in @xmath51 spherical shells equally spaced in a logarithmic scale of radius spanning the range from @xmath52 to @xmath46 , where @xmath53 is the convergence radius defined by @xcite and estimated for the minimum number of particles per halo .",
    "the halo centers are given by the minimum of the potential .",
    "darkexp , einasto , and dehnen  tremaine models are fitted to the density profiles of the halos by minimizing the following function @xmath54^{2},\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the number of shells and @xmath56 is the mean radius of particles inside the @xmath57-th shell . following @xcite ,",
    "we restrict all fits to the radial range @xmath58 , which prevents including dynamically less relaxed parts of the halos . here",
    ", @xmath59 is defined as the radius at which @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",
    "we first estimate @xmath59 by fitting an einasto profile in all @xmath51 shells , i.e. , within the radial range @xmath62 .",
    "this sets the restricted fitting range to be the same in both cases .",
    "next , @xmath59 , @xmath63 , and @xmath3 , @xmath1 or @xmath64 are obtained from a restricted fit to either model . in fitting darkexp , we used density profiles computed on a grid of @xmath64 , ranging from 2.0 to 8.0 with an interval of 0.01 .",
    "figure  [ density - sim ] shows the density profiles of all halos selected for the analysis , in three ranges of the shape parameter , i.e. , @xmath1 for the einasto model , @xmath3 for the dehnen  tremaine model , and @xmath64 for darkexp .",
    "the ranges were chosen such that there are equal numbers of halos in each of the three bins .",
    "the mean value of @xmath3 is 1.36 with an rms scatter of 0.18 while the mean value of @xmath1 is 0.19 ( rms scatter 0.05 ) .",
    "for @xmath2 the mean value is 3.9 ( rms scatter 0.6 ) .",
    "there is no significant correlation in these parameters with the mass over the narrow range of masses considered ( @xmath65  @xmath66 m@xmath7 ) . the lack of any difference between residuals from the best - fitting einasto , dehnen ",
    "tremaine , and darkexp profile leads to the conclusion that _ these models recover spherically averaged density profiles of simulated cosmological halos equally well . _",
    "the second important conclusion is that , in the narrow mass range considered , _ there is a range of density profile shapes among simulated systems , and that the darkexp family of models captures that spread very well_. figure  [ phi0-gamma ] ( top ) illustrates this pictorially ; it shows the best - fit shape parameters of the einasto and darkexp fits to the simulated halos ; @xmath2 and @xmath1 range between 2.56 and 0.050.35 , respectively ( @xmath3 ranges from 0.8 to 1.7 ) .",
    "the scatter in @xmath1 is about 0.05 . as expected ( section 2 ) ,",
    "the data show a tight relation between the central potential @xmath64 and the shape parameter @xmath1 of the einasto profile , which traces the @xmath1@xmath64 relations obtained from matching einasto and darkexp density profiles .",
    "have emphasized the wide range of central logarithmic slopes inferred observationally for different clusters of galaxies .",
    "darkexp applies to equilibrium collisionless systems , so in addition to dark matter halos it can also be applied to galaxies and clusters that host baryons , regardless of the physical processes that led to the formation of the final equilibrium systems , provided that the evolution and the present state of these systems are not dominated by two - body encounters , and the systems are not far from being spherical .",
    "we here show that relaxed galaxy clusters exhibit non - universality that can be described by the darkexp model .",
    "@xcite constructed spherically averaged density profiles of seven massive relaxed clusters , using central galaxy kinematics on the smallest scales , strong lensing on intermediate scales and weak lensing on large scales .",
    "to separate out dark matter density profiles they subtracted the stellar contribution of the central galaxy assuming constant mass - to - light ratio for the stellar population .",
    "the remaining dark matter profiles were fit with cored nfw and generalized nfw ( gnfw ) forms .",
    "the @xmath3-model we use here and the gnfw differ in the asymptotic outer logarithmic slope ( @xmath27 vs.  @xmath67 ) , so the differences are confined mostly to radii outside @xmath59 . at @xmath68",
    "the two models are parametrized similarly , therefore one can compare the two models , if one leaves out the outermost radii .",
    "the @xcite cluster profiles extend about 2 decades in radius interior to @xmath59 , and about 0.75 of a decade exterior to @xmath59 , so the bulk of the radial range is usable in the comparison .",
    "we took the @xcite inner logarithmic slope for each cluster and set it equal to @xmath3 .",
    "this supplies the vertical axis coordinate in figure  [ phi0-gamma ] ( bottom ) .",
    "we then fit darkexp directly to @xcite gnfw fits , excluding the outer radii beyond which the logarithmic slope is steeper than @xmath69 ( the fits are insensitive to the truncation logarithmic slope for values between @xmath24 and @xmath70 ) .",
    "this gave us @xmath2 , plotted along the horizontal axis .",
    "the seven galaxy clusters are plotted as solid points in figure  [ phi0-gamma ] ( bottom ) .",
    "they fit well the @xmath2@xmath3 relation matched in slope and are consistent with our proposed analytical approximation ( the dotted red line ) .    from figure  [ phi0-gamma ]",
    "we conclude that clusters are fit with a range of @xmath2 s , suggesting non - universality .",
    "observed relaxed clusters of galaxies appear to follow darkexp ; and seem to prefer @xmath2 values about 23.5 , on average smaller than cluster - sized dark matter halos in pure dark matter simulations , which are fitted with values of @xmath2 in the range 26 .",
    "so far we discussed dispersion in density profiles among massive pure dark matter halos .",
    "we next consider the differences between pure dark matter halos and observed low mass systems .",
    "the central density profiles of observed galaxy clusters appear to be , on average , shallower than those of clusters in pure dark matter simulations .",
    "likewise , the central logarithmic slopes of observed dwarf galaxies are shallower than simulated dark - matter subhalos . in this section",
    "we discuss the relative energies between the steeper pure dark matter and shallower observed structures",
    ". we will show that the differences amount to a large fraction of the total binding energies of the haloes , demonstrating that the differences in central logarithmic slopes or @xmath2 represent significant differences between the halos in terms of global energetics .",
    "moreover , assuming the difference between two states or halos is brought about by some dynamical or baryonic proces , we compute what it would take to induce a transformation between the two , such as the cusp  core transition . calculating relative ( fractional ) energetics allows us to bypass the uncertainties and unknowns associated with the specific physical processes that would bring about the transformation .",
    "the differences between the nfw and einasto descriptions of pure dark matter halos are small in comparison to the differences between dark matter profiles of subhalos / satellite halos and observed dwarf galaxies which may have central cores .",
    "most dwarf galaxies appear to exhibit significant central density cores @xcite .",
    "whether all dwarfs have a universal profile or not is still unclear because of the large uncertainties associated with the measurement of the central logarithmic density slopes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; conclusions seem to depend on the sample and the methods used .",
    "for example , @xcite claim that dwarfs are consistent with having a universal central logarithmic density slope of @xmath71 , with a scatter of 0.28 , while @xcite claim that individual dwarf spheroidals show considerable scatter around an average logarithmic slope of @xmath17 .    for reviews of this small scale controversy , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the suggested solutions to this set of problems are either baryonic or particle in nature .",
    "warm dark matter does not seem to be the solution : @xcite and @xcite find that warm dark matter leads to cusps just like cold dark matter does , although with very small central cores which however are astrophysically uninteresting and much smaller than what is claimed to be present in dwarf satellites .",
    "indeed , @xcite conclude that warm dark matter halos and subhalos have cuspy density distributions that are well described by nfw or einasto profiles ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite and @xcite argue that baryonic physics @xcite , via a process similar to violent relaxation , can lead to changes in the potential , specifically , a more shallow potential and hence a core ( see also * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively , self - interacting dark matter can produce large cores @xcite .",
    "real systems like dwarf spheroidals may have shallower central logarithmic slopes and larger central regions of near constant density than pure dark matter halos .",
    "how does one make the central potential less deep than found in numerical simulations ?",
    "the change is likely brought about by baryonic physics @xcite which may induce a transformation from a typical @xmath17 logarithmic slope to a cored halo @xcite . in our picture",
    "this would correspond to a change in the central potential , through some energy injection process .",
    "for darkexp to be valid , this energy injection would have to be collisionless to preserve the assumptions behind the darkexp derivation .",
    "it is interesting to note that the baryonic feedback process proposed by @xcite is not only collisionless but also dissipationless .",
    "we here illustrate the cusp - core transition as a transformation between two darkexp halos .",
    "we can use darkexp as a starting point for modeling baryonic effects if they are mostly non - collisional , in which case darkexp is also a good descriptor of the final state .",
    "note , however , that we do not intend to model the details of the transition in terms of detailed physics ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) such as the mass accretion history or star - formation history of the system , the supernova energy deposition efficiency , or the stellar initial mass function .",
    "cusps or cores of dark matter halos are governed by the normalized dimensionless depth of the central potential well , to the extent that their potentials are shaped by collective relaxation .",
    "how different are halos with different normalized central potentials , apart from their central logarithmic density slopes ?",
    "we obtain analytical expressions for their total potential energies in appendix a. we can also express the total potential energy of a halo as @xmath72 with @xmath73 @xcite ( see figure  [ w ] ) . here",
    "@xmath74 is the total mass ( which is finite for darkexp and the @xmath3-models ) and @xmath75 is the half - mass radius .    for a @xmath3-model , the halo binding energy relative to an nfw cusp model",
    ", i.e. , @xmath76 , is @xmath77 ( equation  [ wgamma ] ) .",
    "this relation is plotted in figure  [ w ] along with the corresponding relation based on darkexp .",
    "the binding energy of a cored halo ( @xmath78 ) is @xmath79 less than that of a cuspy halo ( @xmath76 ) , relative to the binding energy of the cored halo . for @xmath80 , @xmath81 the difference is @xmath82 .",
    "these differences are significant , i.e. , halos do not have universal structures or relative binding energies if they have different central cusp strengths .    for a dwarf galaxy with virial mass @xmath83 m@xmath7 , @xmath84 kpc ,",
    "the total potential energy is @xmath85 erg . the cusp ",
    "core transition therefore requires @xmath86 erg or @xmath87 supernovae ( for a supernova energy input of @xmath88 erg ) for @xmath78 ( higher values of @xmath89 require less energy input ) .",
    "this corresponds to a total stellar mass produced of @xmath90 m@xmath7 , with an uncertainty of about a factor of 2 depending on the initial mass function .",
    "these estimates are consistent with those of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "because supernovae do not transfer all their kinetic energy into the dark matter , the energy injection is less efficient and more supernovae are needed . on the other hand ,",
    "the energy input needed is diminished when considering the actual star formation and mass assembly history of dwarf spheroidals @xcite .",
    "finally , observations do not strictly require @xmath91 , further reducing the energy requirements .",
    "as discussed in section 3.2 , dark matter halos of clusters of galaxies also appear to have central logarithmic slopes that are more shallow than @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the effect seems to be generic @xcite , giving central logarithmic slopes in the range @xmath920.8 . while some of this may be due to substructure , line of sight effects , or elongated structures ( e.g. , due to merging ) , it does appear that central profiles more shallow than nfw are observed in clusters of galaxies .",
    "however , for a massive cluster of galaxies with @xmath93 m@xmath7 and @xmath94 kpc , the energy input required is @xmath95 erg , corresponding to an unrealistic total stellar mass of @xmath96 m@xmath7 , if supernovae were to provide the energy input .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that supernova feedback is the origin of cores in clusters of galaxies .",
    "it is possible that dynamical friction @xcite of infalling satellites or black holes , active galactic nuclei @xcite or cluster mergers @xcite ( although see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may provide the energy injection needed to erase the central cusp .",
    "some clusters may also be born with a shallow potential , although it is noteworthy that a fair fraction of simulated cluster dark halos have central logarithmic slopes steeper than @xmath17 .",
    "it has become standard practice to fit spherically averaged density profiles of dark matter halos , galaxies and clusters with phenomenological models , such as the nfw or its variants , or the einasto @xmath1-model .",
    "we suggest that the reason these functions fit well is because they happen to resemble darkexp , which is a theoretically derived model for collisionless self - gravitating systems , based on statistical mechanical arguments .",
    "moreover , in this paper we have argued that non - universality of dark - matter halos is a natural expectation of darkexp .",
    "if dark - matter halos would have logarithmic slopes at small radii robustly resolved in simulations equal to @xmath17 , this would require some fine tuning of the model .",
    "the expectation of a range of properties appears to be borne out in simulations , and in observations of dwarf galaxies , and clusters of galaxies . in this picture , the range of central logarithmic slopes inferred can be seen as a reflection of a range in their central normalized potentials , or , equivalently , their total normalized binding energies .",
    "this insight is useful when quantifying the extent to which halos differ as a result of their formation history and also can be used to analytically relate halos with different cusps to each other , such as required in the cusp - core transition .",
    "we do not suggest that the central potential is set up by some external process which then in turn causally sets the density profile .",
    "rather , the central potential and the logarithmic slope of the density profiles are both signatures of an underlying formation process which determines the final equilibrium state .",
    "future data on both dwarfs and clusters will be necessary to more fully examine the applicability of darkexp to the whole range of systems .    because darkexp does not have an analytical density profile , and if using tables of darkexp @xmath97 is not an option , we have identified phenomenological fitting functions that match darkexp reasonably well , and have presented relations between darkexp s @xmath2 and the best fitting @xmath3 of the @xmath3-model , and @xmath1 of the einasto model . the resulting darkexp @xcite density profiles are well represented by dehnen  tremaine @xmath3-models @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of these models is that they allow for a range of values of the central cusp logarithmic slope and so can be used to model both the standard nfw - type halos with @xmath98 as well as more shallow ( or steep ) halos . as shown in this paper ( figures  [ phi0-gamma ] and [ density - sim ] ) and in other recent work @xcite , cold dark",
    "matter numerical simulations by themselves generate a significant dispersion in @xmath1 of simulated halos , reflecting different formation , accretion , or tidal stripping histories .",
    "darkexp naturally accounts for such non - universality in profile shapes . in figure [ density - sim ]",
    "we demonstrate the non - universality of the pure dark matter halos . both the shallower and the steeper systems are well fit by darkexp . while we have demonstrated a significant non - universality found in simulations of massive dark - matter halos , with a similar dispersion noticable in simulations of lower mass halos ( e.g. , *",
    "* ) , it would be important to quantify the degree of non - universality and range of central potentials realized as a function of halo mass ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in section  4 we compare the potential energies associated with the core and cusp systems and discuss the required amount of energy and the possible injection mechanisms to bring about the transformation from a steeper pure dark matter system to a shallower observed system .",
    "core transition can not be simply modeled as a ` one - size - fits - all ' transition from an nfw halo ( or a darkexp with @xmath99 ) to a cored halo ( or a darkexp with @xmath100 ) , because for both dwarf galaxies @xcite and clusters @xcite there is a real dispersion in their observed properties .",
    "as highlighted in this paper the same is true for simulated massive dark - matter halos ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for other mass ranges ) .",
    "when modeling any transition of the central logarithmic slope properties as a result of some energy injection process , it is important to consider the significant dispersion in both the initial dark matter halos and those observed or affected by energy injection processes .",
    "finally , we note that the @xmath2@xmath3 relation ( figure  [ phi0-gamma ] ) can be directly tested in numerical simulations , e.g. , dissipationless collapse or cosmological simulations .",
    "halos with steeper profiles should have deeper central normalized potentials ( possibly due to different formation times and accretion histories ) . for clusters of galaxies",

    "the poorer fit at larger radii is because the einasto profile does not have a ` built - in ' outer logarithmic slope of @xmath27 , except for values around the canonical @xmath41 .",
    "the profiles were matched in density , so the corresponding blue and green curves intersect each other at @xmath117 .",
    "the dashed curves in the same plot are the corresponding logarithmic density slopes ; here too einasto models track the respective darkexp very well , although the blue and green dashed curves do not intersect each other at @xmath117 because the models can be matched either in density , or logarithmic density slope , not both .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ benchmark ] shows darkexp of @xmath118 as solid blue curves , and the matched @xmath3-models ( equation  [ gamod ] ) as red solid curves .",
    "these were matched in density .",
    "the @xmath3-models approximate darkexp very well over nearly 4 decades in radius .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ benchmark ] shows the same darkexp density profiles with the @xmath3-models that were matched in logarithmic density slope , at @xmath117 .",
    "these too provide very good fits to darkexp .",
    "figure  [ beta ] shows the effect of varying @xmath29 in the generalized hernquist model ( equation  [ hernmod ] ) , between @xmath119 and @xmath120 ( here we show model pairs matched only in density , not logarithmic slope ) .",
    "a value of @xmath121 appears to provide a slightly better fit than @xmath31 but the improvement is not sufficiently significant to justify the introduction of another parameter .",
    "note , however , that in the inner parts the correspondence with darkexp is inferior to that of the einasto profile , despite the fact that the generalized hernquist model has an extra shape parameter .",
    "overall , @xmath3-models appear to be useful representations of darkexp ."
