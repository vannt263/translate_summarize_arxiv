    "an understanding of the overshoot region at the bottom of the sun s convective envelope is important for a number of reasons .",
    "the overshoot region approximately coincides with the solar tachocline , a region of rotational shear which is generally believed to play a key role in the solar dynamo : overshooting is likely to be important for helping to store the magnetic flux below the convection zone during the solar cycle .",
    "bulk motion in the overshoot region also affects the thermal stratification and it may contribute to significant mixing of chemical elements , for example transporting fragile elements such as lithium to hotter regions where they are destroyed more easily than in the convection zone .",
    "more generally , convective overshoot in stars ( particularly those with convective cores ) is likely to be an important and as yet imperfectly understood process affecting age estimates of stars , and so improved constraints on theories of overshooting obtained from a study of how overshooting works in the solar case can be important for understanding stars more widely .",
    "helioseismology provides a means of probing directly the conditions inside the sun , because the frequencies of resonant modes set up by acoustic waves propagating in the solar interior depend in particular on the adiabatic sound speed @xmath0 which is given by @xmath1 here @xmath2 is the logarithmic derivative of pressure @xmath3 with respect to density @xmath4 at constant specific entropy , @xmath5 is temperature , @xmath6 is the mean molecular weight , @xmath7 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath8 is the atomic mass unit .",
    "hence the sound - speed gradient with respect to depth depends on the temperature gradient , which itself depends on the mechanism by which heat is transported .",
    "the transition between fully radiative heat transport beneath the convection zone and convective heat transport within the convection zone is manifest in the temperature gradient and hence too in the sound - speed gradient .",
    "if the transition in sound - speed gradient takes place over a distance that is small compared with the vertical wavelength of the acoustic waves near the base of the convection zone , then the transition appears to the waves to be more - or - less sharp and this gives rise to an oscillatory signal in the mode frequencies @xmath9 : the form of the signal gives information about the location and nature of this `` acoustic glitch '' @xcite .",
    "@xcite represented the effect of the base of the convection zone in terms of an additive contribution @xmath10 to the frequencies , relative to those of a corresponding model in which the transition had been smoothed out . for low - degree modes ( see @xcite ) a break in the first derivative of the sound speed gives rise to a contribution of the form @xmath11 while a break in the second derivative gives rise to a similar signal but with a sine term instead of a cosine , and with a different frequency dependence of @xmath12 . here",
    "@xmath13 is essentially the value of @xmath14 at the location of the acoustic glitch , where @xmath15 is acoustic depth beneath the surface , @xmath16 being the corresponding distance to the centre and @xmath17 the surface radius of the sun . also , @xmath18 is a phase introduced by the reflection of the mode at the turning points , depending in particular on the near - surface structure .",
    "the function @xmath12 is an amplitude which depends on the sharpness and nature of the convection - zone base : the smoother the transition , the smaller in general will be the amplitude .",
    "however , if moderate - degree data are used , as in the case of sun where we have accurate data for modes whose degree is above 3 , the above expression needs to include additional terms , both in the amplitude ( @xcite ) and in the argument of the signal ( @xcite ) , to account for the first - order effect of the mode degree on the signal .",
    "overshoot at the base of the solar convection has traditionally been modelled using non - local mixing - length theory ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "such models mostly predict an overshoot region that is nearly adiabatically stratified ; in terms of the logarithmic temperature gradient @xmath19 one finds that @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the adiabatic temperature gradient , @xmath22 being specific entropy .",
    "the depth of overshoot region is typically between @xmath23 and @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the pressure scale height at the base of the convection zone , with a very steep transition towards the radiative temperature gradient .",
    "the results have seemed rather robust , since the above behaviour is found in models incorporating quite different large - scale flow structures : for example @xcite assumed overturning convective rolls whilst @xcite explicitly modelled downward plumes in the overshoot region .",
    "we note , however , that other treatments of the overshoot region have suggested a much smoother transition to the radiative gradient ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "the rather abrupt transition in the temperature gradient predicted by the non - local mixing - length models has been parameterized and incorporated into solar models @xcite in order to compare the predicted acoustic - mode frequencies with those observed on the sun .",
    "models with and without overshooting all have an oscillatory signal in frequencies coming from the base of the adiabatically stratified region , but the amplitude of the signal in the frequencies in the overshoot models is greater than in models without overshooting .    when the observed and model frequencies are compared , it is found that the amplitude of @xmath10 in the sun is comparable with or smaller than that in models without overshooting , implying that the amount of overshooting of the kind predicted by these mixing - length models is very small .",
    "@xcite and @xcite concluded that the extent of any such overshoot at the base of the convection zone was less than one tenth of a pressure scale - height .",
    "a similar limit was found by @xcite , while @xcite obtained a somewhat weaker limit .",
    "@xcite noted that the composition gradient caused by the inclusion of helium settling produced a sharper transition in the sound - speed gradient , even in models without overshoot , and hence a larger oscillatory signal . from these analyses",
    "it would appear that the transition in sound - speed gradient at the base of the solar convection zone is if anything smoother than in the non - overshoot models .",
    "a caveat is that what we purport to measure in the above studies is the spherically symmetric component of the structure : departures from sphericity , such as a latitudinal dependence to the shape of the base of the convection zone , could make the transition appear smoother than it is locally . the helioseismic evidence , however , is that the location of the base of the convection zone is independent of latitude @xcite .",
    "changes of the base of the convection zone on time scales shorter than the observation interval could also have a similar effect by introducing a time - averaging effect on the mode frequencies that would mimic a smoother transition .",
    "the importance of this effect is difficult to estimate , however , and depends strongly on the 3d nature of convection at the base of the envelope .",
    "overshoot has been addressed in the last two decades by a variety of 2d and 3d numerical simulations @xcite . whilst the non - local mixing - length models have clearly predicted an adiabatic overshoot region of a sizeable fraction of a pressure scale height and a rather sharp transition to the radiative zone beneath ,",
    "the numerical simulations show a greater variety of possible behaviours .",
    "the work by @xcite is currently one of the best resolved and most turbulent investigations : it shows strongly subadiabatic overshoot with very smooth transition towards the radiative temperature gradient .",
    "most of the earlier 2d and 3d simulation were more in the laminar regime and found , depending on their parameters ( mainly the stiffness of the subadiabatic layer ) , both nearly adiabatic overshoot and extended subadiabatic overshoot .",
    "@xcite tried to understand the cause of the discrepancies in different overshoot treatments , which have been attributed either to over - simplifications in the mixing - length approach and related models or to the fact that numerical simulations are not in the correct parameter range . using a semi - analytic plume model @xcite showed that the main differences result from different values of the energy flux used in these models ( more exactly the energy flux divided by the filling factor of downflows , expressed by a dimensionless number @xmath26 , with the energy flux @xmath27 , the downflow filling factor @xmath28 , pressure @xmath3 and density @xmath29 at the base of the convection zone ) .",
    "the value of @xmath30 ranges from @xmath31 ( mixing - length models ) to up to @xmath32 ( numerical simulations ) .",
    "the influence of the energy flux ( lower energy flux leading to more adiabatic overshoot ) was already indicated in the work of @xcite and has been confirmed by @xcite by varying the energy flux over two orders of magnitude ( with the caveat that lowering the energy flux in a numerical simulations typically decreases also the degree of turbulence ) .",
    "the main conclusion of the work of @xcite is that non - local mixing - length models and current numerical simulations mark two extremes in terms of the parameter @xmath30 and the sun might have a solution somewhere in between , however most likely closer to the mixing - length regime unless the downflow filling factor at the base of the convection zone is tiny .",
    "this leads to the possibility that solar overshoot has a stratification close to adiabatic , but with a transition towards the radiative gradient that is smoother than found in non - local mixing - length models .",
    "accordingly , we have created a family of semi - analytic models that display a range of possible characteristics for the convection zone , which may give better agreement with the helioseismic observations than the old non - local mixing - length models .",
    "moreover , helioseismology may determine which model provides the best fit to the actual stratification of the sun ; this may , we hope , teach us something about the physics of convection and convective overshooting in stellar interiors .    the goal of the present paper is to discuss these models and compare their seismic properties with those observed .",
    "section  2 presents the characteristics of the semi - analytic overshoot model and its parameterization in our stellar structure calculations . in section  3",
    "we describe the seismological method we use to analyse the oscillation frequencies to establish the characteristics of the transition in structure near the base of the convective envelope , and we apply it to the analysis of solar data in section  4 .",
    "section  5 describes the solar models used in this study and presents the analysis of the frequencies computed from those models . in section  6",
    "we synthesize the observational and model results and discuss our inferences , and we present our conclusions in section  7 .",
    "as summarized in the introduction a variety of overshoot models including simplified plume models @xcite , non - local convection models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and 3d simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) predict overshoot profiles that are substantially smoother than those obtained through non - local mixing - length models .",
    "while the physical reasons for the smoother transitions differ among these models , the resulting profiles show a large degree of similarity . for the purpose of the helioseismic investigation in this paper",
    "it is not essential to use exactly one of these models .",
    "rather what is important is to realize that overshoot profiles smoother than those obtained by standard mixing - length theory are possible . using the models of @xcite as guidance we find the following properties to be rather general for all profiles :    1 .",
    "the overshoot profile matches smoothly with the radiative gradient beneath .",
    "2 .   in the overshoot region",
    "@xmath33 is in between @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "3 .   the lower part of the convection zone is weakly subadiabatic .    in this investigation",
    "we use a parameterization which produces overshoot profiles possessing the above - mentioned properties . after finding the overshoot profile that is most consistent with helioseismic data we shall return to overshoot models and discuss potential implications .",
    "the idea is to provide an analytical match to the behaviour obtained in the numerical simulations by rempel ( 2004 ) , constrained such that the temperature gradient and its first derivative are everywhere continuous .",
    "this is done by representing the actual temperature gradient as a function of @xmath16 thus : @xmath36 where @xmath37 . for @xmath38 ,",
    "the temperature gradient is radiative , @xmath39 .",
    "the constants @xmath40 and @xmath41 are determined such that @xmath42 where the dash indicates differentiation with respect to @xmath16 .",
    "thus the formulation is characterized by @xmath43 , which determines the overall location of the transition from the adiabatic to radiative temperature gradient , and @xmath44 , which is the radius at the bottom of the overshoot region , @xmath45 essentially controlling its width .",
    "we assume the full overshoot region , down to @xmath44 , to be chemically fully mixed .",
    "the parameter @xmath46 provides additional flexibility to the location of the overshoot region , relative to the base , @xmath47 , of the convectively unstable region , defined by @xmath48 .",
    "given @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath46 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are determined from eqs  ( [ eq : constraints ] ) , which yield @xmath49 \\ ;      \\big [ \\beta + \\exp(2 \\zetaf ) \\big ] \\ ; ,     \\label{eq : revvalcon}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 , and , neglecting @xmath51 , @xmath52 ^ 2 } % \\nonumber \\\\ % & = &   = - { 1 \\over d } \\ ; { 2 \\exp(2 \\zetaf ) \\over \\beta + \\exp(2 \\zetaf ) } \\ ; \\big[\\nablarad(\\rf ) - \\nablaad(\\rf ) \\big ] \\ ; , \\label{eq : revdercon } % \\end{eqnarray}\\ ] ] on using eq .",

    "following @xcite and @xcite , we consider the frequencies of the modes to be a sum of two components : a smooth component @xmath63 , and an oscillatory component @xmath10 coming from the acoustic glitch caused by the base of the convection zone and any overshoot .",

    "( [ eq : signal ] ) an expansion in @xmath77 has been used to derive the expression for the amplitude : moreover , it has been assumed that the acoustic glitch is adequately represented by a single location @xmath78 to perform the expansion in frequency .",
    "the phase function @xmath67 , due to the reflection of the modes at the inner and outer turning points , is assumed to be represented asymptotically @xcite by @xmath79 where @xmath80 are unknown expansion coefficients .",
    "the remaining parameters are related to the internal structure of the star through the following relations : @xmath81 while @xmath82 and @xmath83 depend on the structure at the transition ( see @xcite , for the details ) .",
    "note that the measurable quantity @xmath84 is not identical to @xmath85 , the acoustic depth of the acoustic glitch , because it includes a contribution @xmath86 from the dependence of @xmath67 on frequency .",
    "similarly , @xmath87 contains a contribution from the @xmath74-dependent part of @xmath67 .    in the present work we are mainly interested in exploring the nature of the profile of the transition near the base of the convection zone .",
    "thus we wish to measure the different contributions to the signal coming from the discontinuities in the first and second derivatives of the sound speed .",
    "in previous works we have found that if @xmath18 is also fitted as a free parameter , there is a strong correlation between the resulting values of @xmath84 and @xmath18 .",
    "this probably results from the fairly narrow range of frequencies included and the weak dependence on mode degree for most of the points , which means that a change in the average of @xmath88 can be compensated by a change in @xmath18 and @xmath71 . to overcome this difficulty the two terms in expression ( [ eq : signal ] )",
    "were previously combined in a single cosine function with a single amplitude that depends on frequency and mode degree . however , this option weakens our capacity to study the actual behaviour of @xmath82 and @xmath83 for different profiles of the transition .",
    "thus , in a departure from what we have done previously in @xcite and @xcite , here we use directly the expression ( [ eq : signal ] ) in the fit to the data to determine the four parameters @xmath89 .",
    "the two components of the signal are fitted in the frequencies of modes with degrees @xmath90 and cyclic frequencies @xmath91hz using an iterative least - squares procedure .",
    "the numerical approach is the same as described in appendix  c of @xcite .",
    "as noted above , if @xmath18 is fitted as a free parameter it may be highly correlated with @xmath84 . however , as discussed in appendix a , @xmath18 can be determined independently from analysis of the oscillation frequencies and hence can be regarded as known in the fit to eq .",
    "( [ eq : signal ] ) .",
    "we therefore adopt this procedure .",
    "there is still the difficulty of having @xmath71 as free parameter of the fitting , due to the connection with @xmath87 . considering that @xmath71 is a slowly varying function of @xmath14 in all models , we have chosen to adopt a reference value from the standard solar model corresponding to @xmath92 .    in order to compare the amplitude of the signal for different models and the solar data it is convenient to use a reference value of the amplitude at fixed frequency @xmath93 and at @xmath94 defined by @xmath95    the principal quantities characterizing the signal due to",
    "the transition near the base of the convection zone are the period , measured by @xmath84 , and the amplitude ( given by @xmath82 and @xmath83 ) .",
    "the secondary quantities @xmath87 and @xmath71 are necessary to account for the dependence on mode degree of the amplitude and the period of the signal ( see fig .  3 of @xcite ) as data up to @xmath96 is used .",
    "the advantage of including the higher - degree data is that in general their frequencies are more precisely determined , and the much higher number of mode frequencies being used renders the fitting much more reliable .    our least - squares fitting procedure weights all data equally ,",
    ", it does not take the quoted observational uncertainties into account .",
    "the reason for this choice is that we find it gives better determinations of the two amplitude parameters @xmath82 and @xmath83 : otherwise the largely systematic variation in mode frequency uncertainties with frequency causes these parameters to be less well constrained in the fitting . in practice",
    "it would correspond to putting all the weight on the low - frequency range of the spectrum .",
    "this would mainly lead to the determination of one of the @xmath97 coefficients , rendering the other unnecessary in the fit .",
    "the solution would then be mostly determined by the initial guess .",
    "such a frequency - dependent bias of the fitting can be removed if the fitting uses equal weights .",
    "the solar data used in this work have been obtained from mdi / soho observations over a total period of over 14 years . to determine the signal we use sets of frequenciesschou / anavw72z/. ] obtained for 72 days of continuous observations @xcite .",
    "sets of frequencies for 1-year periods are also considered .",
    "these have been obtained by combining 5 consecutive sets of 72-d frequencies to produce an average for each 1-year set .",
    "finally we considered frequencies from a coherently analysed set of 1-yr data from the beginning of the mdi observations .",
    "the results from this set were very similar to those of the corresponding 1-yr average of the 72-d sets and hence will not be discussed separately in the following .",
    "we use modes having degree @xmath98 and cyclic frequency between 1900 and @xmath99hz . because the least - squares fitting ignores the observational uncertainty on the frequencies , only modes with a quoted observational uncertainty below @xmath100hz are used . the phase constant @xmath18 was estimated as discussed in appendix a , from a differential asymptotic analysis of each frequency set relative to the frequencies of model   that was adjusted to match approximately the solar frequencies .",

    "the differences between the illustrated models ( and ) and the sun are similarly small .",
    "in fact , although the models in this paper span a large range of behaviours in terms of the stratification near the base of the convection zone , we stress that they are all close to the sun in terms of their small absolute differences in sound speed .",

    "( to avoid this for the very smooth model   we had to invoke a small opacity reduction to shift the location of the boundary of the convection zone . )",

    "this clear preference is a strong indication in favour of stratifications that include a sub - adiabatic layer within the proper convection zone , as a necessary condition to obtain sufficiently smooth transitions that will be consistent with the solar data .",
    "any model that includes overshoot will need to be extended from within the convection zone , replacing the commonly adopted procedure of adding an overshoot layer to the convective envelope as defined by the mixing - length theory ( or equivalent ) .",
    "the strong helioseismic preference for rather smooth profiles puts very strong constraints on many of the models we discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : intro ] . in the following discussion",
    "we shall try to link the smoothness of the transition in the overshoot region to the underlying physical processes .",
    "a common physical process relevant in most overshoot models is buoyancy braking , which decelerates downflow plumes once a positive temperature perturbation has been built up after travelling downward for a sufficient distance in a subadiabatic stratification .",
    "buoyancy breaking establishes a direct connection between the kinetic energy of downflows at the base of the convection zone and thermal properties of the overshoot region beneath .",
    "this leads to a relation between the mach number @xmath153 required at the base of the convection zone , the subadiabaticity as well as the depth of the overshoot region .",
    "assuming for simplicity a constant value for the superadiabaticity @xmath154 , we can estimate temperature and density perturbations as function of the overshoot depth , @xmath155 , as follows : @xmath156 buoyancy braking gives a relation between the kinetic energy of the plume at the base of the convection zone and the buoyancy work in the overshoot region : @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the gravitational acceleration . combining both equations",
    "leads to ( neglecting factors of order unity ) : @xmath159 in the traditional non - local mixing - length overshoot models we have @xmath160 and @xmath161 leading to @xmath162 , which corresponds to a convective velocity of about @xmath163 , consistent with mixing - length models assuming a filling factor of about @xmath164 .",
    "having a smooth transition of the overshoot from nearly adiabatic to radiative temperature gradients requires that the average values for @xmath165 are of the order of @xmath166 . in that case",
    "our estimate requires @xmath167 corresponding to a convective velocity of about @xmath168 at the base of the convection zone .",
    "the latter is ( if at all ) only possible if the filling factor for downflow plumes is very small .",
    "this is a inevitable consequence of buoyancy braking , which applies to overshoot models in a very general sense , whether numerical 3d simulation or any other simplified treatment .",
    "the key for the argumentation above is the fact that a smooth overshoot profile implies automatically substantial deviations from adiabaticity in an extended region that is convectively mixed .",
    "many of the numerical overshoot simulations to date show smooth transitions .",
    "however , the latter are to a large degree related to numerical setups that have either a reduced stiffness in the radiative interior or have large energy fluxes ( to reduce thermal relaxation time scales ) that result in much larger mach numbers and allow consequently for smooth overshoot profiles with substantial deviations from adiabaticity .",
    "@xcite presented a series of numerical experiments that show the return to more adiabatic step - like overshoot profiles with reduction of the overall energy flux .",
    "extrapolating these results to the solar energy flux seems to make a step - like quasi - adiabatic overshoot almost inevitable .",
    "the investigation of @xcite aimed at understanding the physical parameters under which a smooth transition can be expected .",
    "the two necessary conditions found were that a ) the downflow filling factor is small and b ) there is a continuous distribution of downflow strength .",
    "while the latter is a natural consequence of convection , the former is very controversial and not supported by any numerical simulations we know about ( the required downflow filling factors would be smaller than @xmath169 ) .",
    "overall it appears that within the framework of models discussed above it is almost impossible to obtain sufficiently smooth profiles that agree with the helioseismic constraints .",
    "this difficulty is strongly related to the effective role of buoyancy braking in the overshoot region .",
    "only if we relax this assumption is it possible to obtain smooth overshoot profiles for moderate mach numbers .",
    "it has been suggested by @xcite that smooth overshoot profiles can be easily obtained once the assumption of a strong correlation between vertical velocity and temperature fluctuation is dropped .",
    "they suggested that in the extreme case of vanishing correlation the penetration is only limited by turbulent dissipation , with no impact on the thermal stratification . for a smoothly diminishing correlation a smooth transition of all overshoot quantities results .",
    "@xcite , in fact , presented a model that leads to such very smooth transitions , by using a non - local convection model that is based on a moment approach computing auto and cross - correlations of turbulent velocity and temperature @xcite .",
    "this model predicts a strong decorrelation of velocity and temperature fluctuation in the lower overshoot region of the sun , while the authors find a strong anticorrelation in the upper overshoot region above the photosphere .",
    "the difference between the overshoot regions is attributed to the values of the pclet number , which are much smaller than unity in the photosphere and much larger in overshoot region at the base of the convection zone .",
    "the overall outcome is a temperature profile that is very similar to the best match we found in this investigation .",
    "their overshoot region extends about @xmath170 beneath the convection zone and shows already a significantly subadiabatic stratification within the lower parts of the convection zone .",
    "recently @xcite used a different non - local model based on the formulation of @xcite and @xcite and found overshoot of only @xmath171 . while still much smoother than the sharp profiles of non - local mixing - length theory , this model provided again a temperature profile that stayed closed to adiabatic for significant extent of the overshoot depth .",
    "this class of models involves a number of assumptions , including the treatment of closure , and parameters generally determined from laboratory experiments or atmospheric or oceanographic measurements ; thus a thorough study of their applicability under stellar conditions is indicated .",
    "in addition , a further investigation is required of the differences between the @xcite and the @xcite approaches .",
    "another possibility could be a spatial or temporal inhomogeneity of overshoot leading to an average profile looking more smooth ; however as estimated below this possibility seems unreasonable , too :    assume that we have a large filling factor @xmath172 so that the overshoot profile has a very sharp transition .",
    "intermittent downflows are able to perturb the sharp boundary between the almost adiabatic overshoot and the underlying strongly subadiabatic radiative zone .",
    "the consequence are buoyancy oscillations with the brunt vsail frequency @xmath173 . due to the sharp transition toward the radiation zone",
    ", @xmath174 would be given by the radiative values just beneath the overshoot region . with a value of @xmath175 at the base of the convection zone , overshoot with a depth",
    "@xmath176 leads to a value of @xmath177 . using @xmath178 , @xmath179 , @xmath180 yields @xmath181 .",
    "amplitude @xmath41 and velocity @xmath182 of the buoyancy oscillations at the overshoot radiative interior interface are related by @xmath183 , where @xmath182 should be of the order of the convective motions perturbing the interface . using a value of @xmath184 yields @xmath185 , which is comparable to the thickness of the transition expected from the overshoot model in the first place .",
    "a larger amplitude requires a larger @xmath182 , which can be only obtained by having faster downflows , meaning smaller filling factor ( so nothing is gained here ) .",
    "we note that the above discussion implicitly assumed again a strong correlation between temperature and velocity fluctuations .",
    "it has been also speculated that the depth of overshoot depends on latitude , due to the changing influence of rotation on convective motions .",
    "the study of @xcite found the deepest penetration at pole and equator and a minimum at around @xmath186 latitude with about @xmath187 of the maximum overshoot depth .",
    "this result was obtained by placing small cartesian simulation domains ( with periodic boundaries in the horizontal direction ) at different latitude positions . having a variation of overshoot depth in a global model adds additional complexity to the problem , since regions with different vertical temperature structures have to be in horizontal force balance .",
    "these temperature differences can be estimated from eq .",
    "( [ thermal ] ) and can be quite substantial . restricting @xmath188 to @xmath189 allows with @xmath190 , @xmath191 and @xmath192 for only a displacement of @xmath193 .",
    "a global force balance in latitude would require either zonal flows or magnetic forces of substantial strength ",
    "at least the zonal flows should leave observable helioseismic signatures given the fact that only about @xmath194 temperature difference are required in the convection zone to balance the deviations of differential rotation from the taylor - proudman state . without these flows or magnetic field",
    "such a configuration can not be in a hydrostatic balance and would return to spherical symmetry on a time scale given by @xmath174 .",
    "we have considered a variety of models with different stratification near the base of the convection zone , using a parameterization of the stratification that is motivated by models that have a spectrum of overshooting plumes with a range of depths of penetration . from the range of models we have considered",
    ", we find that a relatively smooth model ( model  ) fits the helioseismic data better than a standard model without convective overshoot , and better also than simple convective overshoot models which possess a more - or - less sharp transition to subadiabatic stratification beneath an overshoot region which is a nearly adiabatic extension of the convection zone .",
    "thus a model characterized by an overshoot layer extending for @xmath195 is compatible with the solar data , corresponding to an additional fully mixed zone of about 3% in radius .",
    "of course it is desirable that solar models be built whose stratification is determined self - consistently from the physics underlying the model , but the parameterization used here may be a reasonable way of approximating such stratification in the context of simple spherically symmetric models .",
    "our investigation method is very similar to that developed by @xcite , though with some differences due to the fact that here we determine the phase @xmath18 independent of our fitting to the oscillatory signal in the frequencies , and therefore we fit amplitude parameters @xmath82 and @xmath83 separately .",
    "it should though be noted that we find that the fitted values of @xmath82 and @xmath83 are not independent , probably because the frequency range of the modes used in the fitting is rather small and insufficient fully to separate the frequency dependent terms of the amplitude , and so their separate values can not be relied upon .",
    "indeed we find that noise in model data tends to cause the value of @xmath83 to be significantly underestimated , relative to its fitted value for noise - free data .",
    "we find , however , that the combination amplitude @xmath106 is a more robust indication of the sharpness of the transition in stratification near the convection - zone base .",
    "our selection of models demonstrates that the signal analysed here is sensitive to acoustic glitches that would barely be noticed through helioseismic inversion which provides averages over such features . on the other hand ,",
    "our analysis is by design insensitive to smooth differences between the sun and the model , including very substantial differences in the sound speed which would be obvious from an inverse analysis .",
    "thus these two techniques are obviously complementary in their ability to characterize the properties of the solar interior .",
    "it may be remarked that we have used models similar to model  , which incorporates the ",
    "old solar element abundances of @xcite , rather than the `` new '' abundances suggested by the work of asplund and collaborators ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the new abundances are known to modify the opacities in the solar interior in such a way as to produce models that are strongly in disagreement with the stratification inferred from helioseismology in the radiative interior , the largest discrepancy being in the vicinity of the base of the convection zone .",
    "since our aim in this work is to investigate the subtle effects of overshoot in this region , it is prudent to start with models that are broadly consistent with the known stratification of the sun s interior , rather than models based on the newer abundances that are further away from the sun s stratification .",
    "although the present analysis makes use of the full range of modes that are sensitive to the base of the convection zone , similar analyses are possible given just the low - degree modes available in observations of distant stars in the foreseeable future ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is potentially an important complement to the more detailed solar data , particularly given the very long timeseries and hence high frequency precision that will be obtained with the _ kepler _ mission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as from planned dedicated ground - based facilities .    from this investigation",
    "we can conclude that i ) overshoot is necessary to improve the agreement between models and helioseismic constraints , ii ) the required overshoot profiles are outside the realm of the classic ",
    "ballistic \" overshoot models and iii ) the lower part of the convection zone is likely substantially subadiabatic .",
    "we can not measure the latter directly , but our investigation indicates that the required level of smoothness can not be achieved without iii ) .",
    "currently only non - local convection models that are based on auto- and cross - correlations of velocity and temperature perturbations are capable of providing overshoot profiles with the desired degree of smoothness in the transition .",
    "however , these theories have hidden parameters and rely on closure models .",
    "to our current knowledge there has not yet been a thorough study on how robust the properties of overshoot ( under the conditions found at the base of the solar convection zone ) are within the framework of these models .",
    "we hope that our investigation motivates more research in that direction .",
    "the indication that the lower part of the convection zone could be substantially subadiabatic ( with values of @xmath196 ) has profound consequences for the storage and stability of magnetic field and the overall role that the lower convection zone ( not just the overshoot region ) might play in the solar magnetic cycle .",

    "<S> the stratification in that region gives rise to a characteristic signal in the frequencies of solar p modes , which has been used to determine the depth of the solar convection zone and to investigate the extent of convective overshoot . </S>",
    "<S> previous helioseismic investigations have shown that the sun s spherically symmetric stratification in this region is smoother than that in a standard solar model without overshooting , and have ruled out simple models incorporating overshooting , which extend the region of adiabatic stratification and have a more - or - less abrupt transition to subadiabatic stratification at the edge of the overshoot region . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we consider physically motivated models which have a smooth transition in stratification bridging the region from the lower convection zone to the radiative interior beneath . </S>",
    "<S> we find that such a model is in better agreement with the helioseismic data than a standard solar model .    </S>",
