    "this analysis is carried out for lhc point 5 , a minimal supergravity ( sugra ) point with @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 . for this point , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 .",
    "the lhc can trivially discover susy at this point and can use precision measurements of combination of masses to determine the sugra parameters . using only such precision measurements , the estimated errors for @xmath11 of luminosity are@xcite    * @xmath12 , * @xmath13 , * @xmath14 , * @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath15 is poorly determined because the weak - scale phenomenology is insensitive to it .",
    "the ultimate lhc precision is considerably better@xcite . given these results , one would presumably choose the energy of the fmc to be @xmath16 , the value assumed here .",
    "susy and standard model events were generated as @xmath17 events with isajet  7.31@xcite ; @xmath18 s and @xmath19 s were interchanged in the analysis .",
    "the toy detector simulation is the same as that used for the lhc studies@xcite except that the @xmath20 range is limited to @xmath21 , approximately equivalent to @xmath22 .",
    "jets were found with a fixed cone algorithm , and leptons were taken from the generator .",
    "slepton candidates are selected by requiring two @xmath19 or @xmath18 leptons with @xmath23 and @xmath24 and no other leptons or jets .",
    "the two leptons are required to satisfy    * @xmath24 , @xmath25 to select two identified leptons in the detector , * @xmath26 to reject lepton pair background , * @xmath27 to reject lepton pair and @xmath28 background , * @xmath29 to reject lepton pair and @xmath28 background .",
    "these cuts eliminate the @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 backgrounds .",
    "a @xmath33 mass cut was found to distort the @xmath34 distributions and was replaced by the cut on @xmath35 .",
    "after these cuts , the dominant background comes from leptonic decays of @xmath36 pairs .",
    "since @xmath37 s decay equally into @xmath38 and @xmath39 , the sm background vanishes up to statistical fluctuations in the combinations @xmath40 ( and also for @xmath41 ) .",
    "this distribution is shown in with error bars appropriate for @xmath11 but with larger monte carlo statistics .",
    "the origins of the signal are shown in .",
    "there are contributions from @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , the last coming from gaugino exchange in the @xmath45-channel .",
    "two - body kinematics implies that for production of @xmath46 , @xmath47 , the maximum and minimum energies are @xmath48\\ ] ] there are four distinct ranges for the lepton energy , one each for @xmath49 and @xmath50 events and two for @xmath51 events : @xmath52 if no other cuts had been made , one would obtain a sum of four square distributions with these limits .",
    "all of these limits can be seen as edges in .    the small lower limits for some of these distributions may make it difficult to identify and measure the electrons in the presence of the muon decay background .",
    "these limits are an `` accidental '' consequence of the masses at this point ; they decrease slowly as @xmath53 is increased .",
    "the easiest edge to detect in is the one at @xmath54 . statistically",
    ", one could detect this with bins of @xmath55 , ten times smaller , but detector resolution and possible confusion from the two edges at about @xmath56 must be included .",
    "we assume an error @xmath57 .",
    "this edge is associated with the @xmath58 sleptons , and its position is given by @xmath59\\ ] ] the other @xmath49 edge is at such low energy , @xmath60 , that it will probably be difficult to measure .",
    "the lhc can measure the endpoint of the @xmath30 mass spectrum and so determine @xmath61 with an estimated error @xmath62 for @xmath11.@xcite while one can estimate the masses independently , the results are not so accurate , so we assume @xmath63 .",
    "then the @xmath64 error ellipse in the @xmath65 plane is given by @xmath66 \\delta m_i \\delta m_j\\ ] ] the resulting error matrix is shown in and represents a significant improvement over the lhc alone .",
    "we next attempt to determine the @xmath67 mass by measuring the edge at @xmath68 in from @xmath69 production .",
    "the error is probably about one bin width , @xmath70 .",
    "unfortunately , the position of this edge , @xmath71\\ ] ] turns out to be very insensitive to @xmath72 for these values of the parameters ; the derivative of the @xmath43 endpoint has a zero as a function of @xmath73 that happens to occur very close to @xmath74 for these masses .",
    "numerically , @xmath75 as a result the sensitivity is accidentally very poor . for `` typical '' values the error on @xmath72",
    "would be about three times that on the edge .",
    "the second lhc point at which the fmc could contribute is lhc point  3 , a sugra point with @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 .",
    "these parameters were chosen so that every accelerator could find something ; in particular , lep recently announced discovery of the light higgs at @xmath81 .",
    "the lhc can make many precise measurements at this point .",
    "however , since sleptons do not occur in the cascade decays of gluinos and squarks , they are not directly constrained .",
    "shows the lepton energy distribution for point  3 and its sources ; compare with for point  5 .",
    "the sleptons are nearly degenerate at this point : @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "hence all the slepton edges are nearly degenerate ; the @xmath42 contribution dominates because the branching ratio for @xmath84 is nearly 100% .",
    "there is also a contribution to like - flavor dileptons from @xmath85 at this point , the long - dashed curve in . while the various contributions in probably can not be resolved , both the upper and the lower edges should be measurable , allowing one to determine @xmath86 and @xmath87 without additional assumptions.@xcite@xcite the resulting error ellipse is shown assuming a measurement error of @xmath88 on each edge .",
    "clearly this case is much more favorable than that for point  5 , although in part the difference is due to the fact that there is less information on sleptons from the lhc .",
    "while polarization is not essential to detect the signal , it would help to interpret it .",
    "in particular , the dominance of the @xmath42 contribution seen in is due to @xmath0 exchange in the @xmath45-channel . even rather modest beam polarization would show that this contribution was dominant and so provide another test of the susy model .",
    "the degree of polarization required needs study but is probably much smaller than that needed to suppress standard model backgrounds ."
