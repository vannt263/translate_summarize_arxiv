    "nasa s _ kepler _ mission @xcite is currently searching for transiting planets in photometric observations of @xmath3 solar - type stars in a 115 deg@xmath4 field of view in the constellation cygnus toward the orion arm of our galaxy . _",
    "kepler _ photometric observations will achieve 80 parts per million precision over 80%-90% of the telescope field of view , sufficient to identify the transit signal from an earth - sun equivalent system . by the end of its four - year mission ,",
    "the combination of _ kepler _ s unprecedented precision , sample size , and homogeneous selection will produce a near ideal set of exoplanet detections to compare with theoretical models of planet formation . though the preliminary exoplanet candidate list announced in @xcite",
    "is incomplete , it is still a valuable constrain on theoretical models of close - in planet formation .    in the core accretion model of close - in planet formation ( e.g. ,",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the cores of giant planets form near the ice line of their parent protoplanetary disk .",
    "the cores grow to an isolation mass and accrete gas until they are massive enough to open - up a gap in their parent disk .",
    "the newly - formed giant planets then type ii migrate into the close proximity of their host star and stop inside the magnetospheric truncation radius of their parent protoplanetary disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "lower - mass planets in the close proximity of their host stars result from the inward type i migration @xcite of planetary embryos that did not reach the mass necessary to initiate runaway accretion of gas and become giant planets .",
    "these lower - mass close - in planets may be hot neptunes or icy super - earths that formed near the ice line of their parent protoplanetary disks and then migrated to just outside the disk magnetospheric truncation radius ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively , they may be rocky earth and super - earth mass planets that formed interior to the ice line and then migrated either singly or in resonant planet convoys into the close proximity of their host star , eventually stopping just outside the disk magnetospheric truncation radius ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "theoretical exoplanet population synthesis ( eps ) models @xcite in the core accretion and migration paradigm have reproduced many trends in the observed distribution of exoplanet properties , and comparisons between observations and models are especially useful to constrain uncertain model parameters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "tidal interactions between close - in planets and their stellar hosts contribute significantly to the dynamical evolution of close - in planet systems after the dissipation of their parent protoplanetary disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "tidal effects tend to circularize and shrink orbits to the point that close - in planets suffer substantial mass loss and eventually tidal disruption ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the efficiency and timescale for these processes are both uncertain ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and highly dependent on the internal structure of the close - in planet ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and its stellar host ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "modeling of the properties of the close - in planet candidates identified by _ kepler _ will help resolve some of these uncertainties .    in this letter , we combine an extended version of the eps models of @xcite hereafter  with the mass  radius relations of @xcite to extract the expected period  radius distribution of the extended eps .",
    "we use monte carlo simulations in concert with a detailed model of _ kepler _ sensitivity and a simple model of tidal evolution to determine the exoplanet period  radius distribution that _ kepler _ would observe in the extended eps as a function of the strength of tidal evolution .",
    "we then compare the result with the observed period distribution of _ kepler _ transiting giant planet candidates announced in @xcite to constrain the strength of tidal evolution in the _ kepler _ candidate planet sample .",
    "we describe our monte carlo simulations and _ kepler_-like observations of the extended eps in section 2 .",
    "we discuss the results and implications of our simulations in section 3 , and we summarize our findings in section 4 .",
    "transit observations directly measure exoplanet radii and orbital periods , while radial velocity observations are necessary to confirm individual transit detections and to determine exoplanet masses .",
    "unfortunately , most exoplanet candidates identified by _ kepler _ will orbit host stars with faint apparent magnitudes . as a result",
    ", radial velocity follow - up will be telescope - time intensive for the more massive _ kepler _ exoplanet candidates and possibly too imprecise at faint magnitudes to confirm lower - mass candidates .",
    "consequently , it becomes important to carefully consider what insight can be gained from the exoplanet period distribution derived purely from _ kepler _ transit photometry .",
    "to that end , we use a monte carlo simulation to systematically observe an extended version of the eps to as much as possible match _ kepler _ observations of the milky way s exoplanet population . in this case",
    ", we have extended the eps such that the distribution of host stellar mass in the 10@xmath5 systems in the eps matches the distribution of host stellar mass expected in _",
    "kepler _ observations .",
    "that is , we match the distribution of host stellar mass in the extended eps to the mass distribution expected in a _ kepler_-like observation of the @xcite solar neighborhood luminosity function , given _",
    "s sensitivity as a function of host spectral type and apparent magnitude .",
    "the first step in our calculation is to approximate the radius of each planet in the extended eps .",
    "the models include the asymptotic semimajor axis , rock mass , ice mass , and gas mass of every planet . from those quantities ,",
    "we use the mass  radius relations given in @xcite to assign radii to giant planets as a function of semimajor axis , solid mass , and gas mass and to terrestrial planets as a function of solid mass and composition .",
    "we then do 100 iterations of a monte carlo simulation in which we assign each planetary system in the extended il10 eps a random host stellar mass , age , and apparent magnitude , as well as a random orbital inclination .",
    "we assign each eccentric planet a random argument of periastron .",
    "we first randomly assign spectral types and apparent magnitudes to the host stars of the extended exoplanet population .",
    "we use the solar neighborhood luminosity function given in table 8.3 of @xcite to determine the number density of fgk stars as a function of spectral type and apparent magnitude ; we use this information to determine the probability that a randomly selected star from the _ kepler _ field is of a given spectral type and apparent magnitude . the spectral type of the assigned host star determines the host stellar mass and radius .    to account for the effect of tidal evolution on the observability of the extended exoplanet population ,",
    "we exploit the fact that the two - gyr moving - average smoothed star formation history in the milky way has been more or less constant over the last @xmath6 gyr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as a result",
    ", the unknown age of a randomly selected star from a magnitude - limited survey of milky way disk stars with main - sequence lifetime @xmath7 short relative to that @xmath6 gyr interval should be distributed more or less uniformly between zero and its main - sequence lifetime .",
    "magnitude - limited transit surveys like _ kepler _ are biased toward stars with @xmath8 , and those stars have main - sequence lifetimes @xmath9 gyr .",
    "consequently , the unknown system age @xmath10 of a typical candidate exoplanet system identified by _ kepler _ in transit with host stellar mass @xmath11 should be well - approximated as uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath12 .",
    "for that reason , in the monte carlo we randomly sample the age of each exoplanet system from a uniform distribution between zero and the main - sequence lifetime of its stellar host . for sun - like stars",
    "@xmath13 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the total amount of hydrogen available for fusion is proportional to @xmath11 .",
    "the main - sequence lifetime is roughly then @xmath14 gyr .",
    "we consider an exoplanet observable if its randomly determined age @xmath10 is less than the timescale for the tidal evolution of its orbit to move it within @xmath15 of its stellar host @xmath16 at which point we assume that the planet is tidally disrupted and no longer observable ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in other words , a planet is only observable if @xmath17 .",
    "we define the time to disruption as ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* )    @xmath18 \\mathrm{,}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath19 is the initial semimajor axis of the planet before tidal evolution , @xmath0 is the specific dissipation function of the host star , @xmath20 is newton s gravitational constant , @xmath21 is the mass of the planet , and @xmath22 is the radius of the host star . the expression given in @xcite is strictly valid only for circular orbits , so we assume that the timescale for eccentricity damping is short relative to @xmath16 .    as a result of the assumptions we make in our treatment of tidal evolution",
    ", we assume that the all planets from the extended population with orbital period @xmath23 days are on circular orbits .",
    "we use the eccentricity distribution generated from the eps models for longer - period systems .",
    "we sample the orbital inclination and argument of periastron from the standard random distributions of those quantities .",
    "we adopt the analytic formulae given in @xcite and @xcite to determine the transit depth and transit duration of every planet found to transit .",
    "finally , we use a detailed model of _ kepler _ sensitivity ( d. koch et al .",
    ", private communication ) that gives the threshold detectable exoplanet radius as a function of host spectral type , host apparent magnitude , transit depth , transit duration , and number of transits over a given duration of observation to determine which of the simulated transiting exoplanets would be detectable in the first 43 days of _ kepler _ data .",
    "we save the results of this iteration , and repeat our monte carlo simulation 100 times to average over all of the given distributions to generate a prediction for the characteristics of the planetary systems _ kepler _ would likely identify in an exoplanet population matching the extended eps .",
    "we carry out this monte carlo simulation for four fiducial values of @xmath0 : 10@xmath24 ( strong tidal evolution ) , 10@xmath25 ( moderate tidal evolution ) , 10@xmath26 ( weak tidal evolution ) , and @xmath27 ( no tidal evolution ) .",
    "we present the results of our simulations for each assumed value of @xmath0 in figures  [ fig01 ] to [ fig04 ] .",
    "the exoplanet period  radius distribution that results from a _ kepler_-like observation of the extended eps is a strong function of @xmath0 . in the most dissipative case @xmath28 , hot jupiters are quickly disrupted and the period distribution of giant planets is flat with a peak at @xmath29 days . at the same time , the handful of planets at very short period @xmath2 day produced by dynamical interactions between planets in multiple - planet systems after the dissipation of their parent protoplanetary disk are tidally disrupted and unobservable in a _ kepler_-like observation . in the less dissipative cases @xmath30 and @xmath31 , hot jupiters survive for a significant fraction of the main - sequence lifetime of their host star and the period distribution of giant planets peaks in the range @xmath32 days in agreement with the giant planet period distribution in @xcite . in those cases ,",
    "the observed period distribution of super - earths would have a long tail toward periods shorter than one day . in the case with no tidal dissipation @xmath33 ,",
    "hot jupiters survive for the entire main - sequence lifetime of their stellar hosts and the period distribution of giant planets is a monotonically decreasing function of period . as a result , a _ kepler_-like observation would be dominated by planets with periods less than one day . unlike the models",
    ", our calculations suggest that in the case of weak or no tidal evolution super - earths should be observed to have a shorter average period than giant planets .    in figure  [ fig05 ]",
    "we compare the giant planet period distribution that results from our simulated _ kepler_-like observation of the extended eps with the _ kepler _ planet - candidate period distribution from @xcite .",
    "massive close - in planets are most sensitive to tidal evolution , so we only compare the period distribution of giant planets from the extended eps more massive than @xmath34 with those _ kepler _ planet candidates with radii greater than 0.5 jupiter radii .",
    "the _ kepler _ planet candidates from @xcite are not necessarily representative of the properties of the still - embargoed full sample of _ kepler _ planet candidates . at the same time , the announced candidates are very likely those candidates unsuitable for radial velocity follow - up . for the massive planet candidates at least , that only indicates they orbit apparently faint host stars .",
    "properties like the average metallicity of a stellar population are not a strong function of galactocentric radius , so there is no reason to believe that the subsample of planets that orbit apparently faint stars at distances @xmath35 pc from the sun is systematically different than the subsample of planets that orbit apparently bright stars at distances @xmath36 pc from the sun .",
    "for those reasons , we argue that a comparison of the period distribution of the announced _ kepler _ exoplanet candidates with the period distribution expected from a _",
    "kepler_-like observation of the extended eps under different assumptions for the strength of tidal evolution is meaningful .",
    "the period distribution of the _ kepler _ planet candidates is inconsistent with both strong tidal evolution and no tidal evolution given the extended eps .",
    "the observed distribution is consistent with the two intermediate values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 , with a better match provided by @xmath31 .",
    "this measurement is also consistent with the typically quoted @xmath37 from the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the average specific dissipation function @xmath31 suggested by our analysis implies that though very - hot super - earths are not common , their substantial transit probability ensures that they will be readily observable by _ kepler_. we expect that about 10% of detected planets with @xmath23 days and @xmath38 should be very - hot super - earths with @xmath2 day .",
    "very - hot super - earths are produced by dynamical interactions in multiple - planet systems , and we suggest that very - hot super - earths systems identified in transit surveys should frequently have observable companions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , the very - hot super - earth corot-7b @xcite is in a confirmed multiple system @xcite with the recently suggested possibility of a third planet @xcite .",
    "very - hot super - earths should also preferentially be found around sun - like stars with @xmath39 , as these stars are likely less dissipative than stars with @xmath40 @xcite . at the same time",
    ", there are other explanations for the properties of the corot-7 system that match the observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "there are many limitations to our approach .",
    "we use only a single value of @xmath0 to model the strength of tidal evolution regardless of host star age or spectral type , when is there is evidence from both observation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and theoretical models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that @xmath0 is a function of host star age and stellar structure , as well as exoplanet orbital period .",
    "this issue will be resolved in the future when the full list of _ kepler _ planet candidates is announced , as the increased host star statistics will allow us to do similar calculations in bins of host star effective temperature and thereby constrain @xmath0 as a function of @xmath41 and therefore stellar structure .",
    "we do not simultaneously evolve the orbit and radius of the exoplanet population ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the migration stopping conditions discussed in section 2.5 of are also uncertain .    in , planets that were massive enough to open - up a gap in their parent protoplanetary disk were stopped just inside the disk magnetospheric truncation radius ( taken to be at @xmath42 days ) , while planets that were not massive enough to open - up a gap were stopped just outside of the magnetospheric truncation radius ( taken to be at @xmath43 days ) .",
    "though these stopping conditions are dependent on the uncertain properties of the parent protoplanetary disk ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , they are self - consistent in that they describe where an exoplanet of a given mass will stop if the stellar magnetic field and disk mass - accretion rate have a given value .",
    "we coupled a detailed model of _ kepler _ sensitivity with the results of the extended eps , a simple model of tidal evolution , and published mass  radius relations for both terrestrial and giant planets to determine the period  radius distribution expected under the extended eps .",
    "we found that the period distribution of close - in giant planets is a strong function of the strength of tidal evolution parametrized as @xmath0 , and we showed that the period distribution of the _ kepler _ planet candidates announced by @xcite is best matched by the extended eps with @xmath1 . in that case , there exists a population of very - hot super - earths with periods less than one day that results from dynamical interactions in multiple - planet systems .",
    "though these very - hot super - earths are rare , their relatively high transit probability and long time - scale for tidal disruption when @xmath44 indicate that they will be observable by _ kepler_. the predicted very - hot super - earths are analogous to the corot-7 system , and we suggest that _ kepler _ should find many such very - hot super - earths in multiple - planet systems preferentially around stellar hosts with convective cores and radiative envelopes .",
