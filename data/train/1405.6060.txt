    "<S> , we have shown that making use of the soft information contained in the analog outcomes of a qubit readout apparatus , as opposed to irreversibly thresholding each qubit to a binary value , can significantly improve the performance of quantum information processing tasks involving the measurement of many qubits . </S>",
    "<S> we have focused on two examples of practical importance . in the case of enhanced state detection with the quantum repetition code </S>",
    "<S> , the number of qubits required to achieve a given error rate can be reduced by up to a factor of @xmath5 through improved data processing alone . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , we have shown that an advantage persists for small numbers of qubits and finite encoding errors . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we have shown that optimal processing of analog qubit readout outcomes can appreciably increase the precision on the measurement of qubit observables ( e.g. , the pauli operators ) . </S>",
    "<S> crucially , in both cases we have demonstrated a significant improvement for an experimentally relevant , non - gaussian qubit readout model  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our results offer encouraging prospects for direct improvements of both small and large scale quantum information processing applications through soft decoding of the qubit readout . </S>",
    "<S> for example , readout error models for decoders of topological codes @xcite could be modified using the ideas presented here to accept analog readout outcomes with realistic statistics at the single - physical - qubit level , improving error detection rates . while there are many possible extensions of this work , the direct improvements we have shown to enhanced state detection and quantum state or parameter estimation are both practical and immediately realizable in a wide array of current experiments .    </S>",
