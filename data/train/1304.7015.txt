    "star forming galaxies are the leading candidate for the source of ultraviolet photons required to reionize the universe .",
    "several lines of evidence indicate that reionization was underway by @xmath3 and ended a few hundred myr later at @xmath47 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "deep near - ir imaging with the hubble space telescope has provided good constraints on the uv luminosity density of star forming galaxies during the reionization epoch ( e.g. , @xcite ) which indicate that the ongoing star formation is likely capable of producing the required ionizing flux .",
    "however , it is unclear whether this radiation is able to escape from galaxies and actually ionize the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "based on estimates of the total uv luminosity density and igm clumping factor , the required escape fraction @xmath5 of hydrogen - ionizing photons is @xmath6 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the precise value of @xmath5 is a key uncertainty in determining the role of galaxies in reionization .",
    "direct measurements of @xmath5 during the reionization epoch are essentially impossible , not only because of the faint apparent luminosity , but also because foreground igm attenuates the ionizing flux to undetectable levels even at @xmath7 .",
    "direct imaging and composite spectra of galaxies at lower redshift has established a modest average @xmath8 for lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "if star forming galaxies dominated reionization , @xmath5 must have been higher at earlier times .",
    "this paper is concerned with improving the constraints on @xmath5 at higher redshifts for which direct measurements are not practical .",
    "our methodology is as follows : @xmath5 is set by the areal covering fraction of hot stars by h i such that @xmath10 , and @xmath11 can be inferred from intermediate dispersion spectroscopy of interstellar uv absorption lines .",
    "the difficulty , of course , is that lbgs at redshift @xmath12 are very faint , so securing suitably high quality absorption line spectra of individual examples is a very challenging proposition . in an earlier paper @xcite",
    "we therefore analyzed the average properties of lbgs at @xmath15 derived from composite spectra in a manner similar to that pioneered at @xmath2 by @xcite .    a particular motivation for the present study was the discovery of a marked reduction with increasing redshift in the equivalent width of low - ionization absorption lines at fixed uv luminosity , suggestive of changes in either the kinematic profile or the covering fraction of neutral gas @xcite .",
    "additionally , spectra of individual galaxies show a trend of increasing ly@xmath0  emission equivalent width with redshift which we argued could reflect evolution in the h  i covering fraction @xcite , especially given the strong correlation of ly@xmath0  and low - ionization absorption lines @xcite . a lower covering fraction for the neutral gas within typical lbgs would be particularly important as it could imply a higher escape fraction of ionizing photons .",
    "the composite spectra discussed by @xcite did not have adequate resolution to distinguish the effects of reduced covering fraction and kinematics , and so the present paper takes this investigation one step further by attempting to resolve this important ambiguity . here",
    "we present higher resolution spectra of 3 gravitationally lensed @xmath1 lbgs .",
    "although their unlensed luminosities are typical of the constituent galaxies comprising the @xcite composite , their individual lensed magnitudes are much brighter enabling comparable signal to noise to the stack of lbgs discussed in our earlier paper .    throughout the paper",
    "we adopt a flat @xmath13cdm cosmology with @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and h@xmath16 kms^-1km@xmath17s@xmath18mpc@xmath18 .",
    "all magnitudes are in the ab system @xcite .",
    "the spectra comprising the composite published by @xcite were taken with the 600 line mm@xmath18 deimos grating with a resolution of @xmath193.5  , although uncertain systemic redshifts led to reduced resolution of the composite spectrum ( corresponding to a velocity resolution of @xmath20 kms^-1km@xmath17s@xmath18  fwhm ) .",
    "the composite comprised galaxies with @xmath2126 with 90% completeness to @xmath22 at @xmath1 .",
    "the stacked spectrum reveals multiple low ionization lines such as si ii @xmath231260 , o i @xmath231302 + si ii @xmath231304 , and c ii @xmath231334 in the region where the signal / noise is optimal . as discussed by @xcite , these lines",
    "are normally saturated so the line depth at a given velocity provides a measure of the areal covering fraction @xmath11 of o and b stars by neutral h i gas along the line of sight .",
    "typical lbgs are too faint for detailed line profile studies even at @xmath24 , but strong gravitational lensing can boost the brightness of representative examples making such studies of individual sources a practical proposition .",
    "studies of several lensed @xmath253 lbgs have found that absorption velocities of low - ionization metal transitions range from @xmath26 to + 500 kms^-1km@xmath17s@xmath18  with typical line centroids @xmath27 kms^-1km@xmath17s@xmath18  @xcite .",
    "the mean low ionization absorption velocity in the @xcite composite is similar , @xmath28 kms^-1km@xmath17s@xmath18 .    in a similar fashion , for the present analysis",
    "we have located 3 gravitationally - lensed lbgs at @xmath1 .",
    "two are independent sources lensed by the well - studied cluster abell 2390 and the third was located in the cluster j1621 + 0607 in the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "a2390_h3 and h5 represent two distinct highly - elongated pairs of lensed images that were spectroscopically confirmed to be at different redshifts by , respectively , @xcite and @xcite . the tangential arc system in j1621 + 0607",
    "was spectroscopically confirmed by @xcite .",
    "the gravitational magnification factor is @xmath1910 in each case @xcite .",
    "we summarize the key properties in table  [ tab : arcs ] .",
    "the redshifts and absolute uv luminosities are representative of sources studied by @xcite .",
    "in addition , for comparison purposes , we include an analysis of high quality spectra for 3 further lensed @xmath243 sources ( courtesy of m. pettini ) in table  [ tab : arcs ] .",
    "these include the ` horseshoe ' ( @xmath29=2.38 , @xcite ) , cb58 ( @xmath29=2.73 , @xcite ) and the ` cosmic eye ' ( @xmath29=3.07 , @xcite ) .",
    "spectra were taken with the 1200 line mm@xmath18 deimos grating during two runs in october 2011 and june 2012 .",
    "this provides a resolution of @xmath191.7  corresponding to a velocity resolution of @xmath1970 km s@xmath18 , considerably better than for the composite discussed by @xcite .",
    "spectra of each galaxy covered wavelengths corresponding to at least 1175@xmath301675   in the rest frame .",
    "the lensed sources in abell 2390 were observed simultaneously with a multi - slit mask that sampled two images of each source .",
    "seeing varied between 04 and 14 fwhm during the observations , and the bulk of the data used has seeing in the range 07 - 09 . some exposures ( @xmath31% )",
    "were affected by cirrus and are not included in the final addition .",
    "total observing times for the final spectra are given in table  [ tab : arcs ] .",
    "the deimos spectra were reduced and calibrated using the spec2d pipeline following the techniques discussed in detail by @xcite . in the case of a2390_h3",
    ", care was taken to ensure that the extracted spectrum was not contaminated by light from a nearby cluster member .",
    "data from the october 2011 and june 2012 runs were reduced separately and the resulting one - dimensional spectra were combined with an inverse - variance weighted mean .",
    "spectra of j1621 are affected by poor sky subtraction residuals , while the abell 2390 arc spectra are of excellent quality .",
    "spectra of different images of the abell 2390 arcs were scaled to the same flux level before combining to a common wavelength scale with 0.7  pixels , roughly nyquist sampled .",
    "the final spectra , shown in figure  [ fig : spectra ] , reach an average continuum s / n per 70 kms^-1km@xmath17s@xmath18 resolution element of 5 for j1621 , 9 for a2390_h3 , and 10 for a2390_h5 over the rest - frame wavelength range 12501650  .",
    "this is comparable to that in the composite spectrum in @xcite which has s / n equivalent to @xmath31 at the improved resolution of 70 kms^-1km@xmath17s@xmath18of our new data .",
    "accurate systemic redshifts are required in order to examine the kinematics of gas seen in absorption and the techniques for estimating these are discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "this is straightforward when nebular emission lines are visible , such as is the case in both j1621 + 0607 ( o  iii ] @xmath321661,6 ) and a2390_h5 ( o iii ] @xmath321661,6 , he ii @xmath231640 , c iv @xmath321548,51 ) .",
    "the strong emission from highly ionized species such as he ii and c iv seen in a2390_h5 is uncommon but has been observed in some high redshift starburst galaxies and signifies an extremely young , metal - poor , and hot stellar population ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively they may signify the presence of an active galactic nucleus , but the narrow line widths ( @xmath33 kms^-1km@xmath17s@xmath18 fwhm , corrected for instrumental resolution ) suggest an origin in star - forming hii regions .",
    "no appropriate features are detected in the spectrum of a2390_h3 and so we estimate the systemic redshift from low - ionization absorption lines using the method of @xcite .",
    "this gives @xmath34 kms^-1km@xmath17s@xmath18 , with uncertainty dominated by an rms difference @xmath35 kms^-1km@xmath17s@xmath18 between redshifts derived from absorption lines and that obtained from nebular emission @xcite .",
    "the adopted systemic arc redshifts are listed in table  [ tab : arcs ] .",
    "ideally we would measure the covering fraction of neutral hydrogen directly from spatially resolved h i absorption .",
    "however , the only available transition ( ly@xmath0 ) is dominated by strong emission with net equivalent width @xmath36  , and the observed line profile is complicated by resonant scattering in the extended circumgalactic medium ( cgm ; @xcite ) .",
    "these effects are apparent from the ly@xmath0  line profiles which show redshifted emission as well as strong absorption arising from both the cgm and ly@xmath0  forest ( figure  [ fig : spectra ] ) .",
    "we therefore estimate the covering fraction of neutral hydrogen from absorption lines of heavier low - ionization species which arise in h i gas , i.e. , those with ionization potentials less than 1 rydberg .",
    "the covering fraction of any ion is related to its absorption line optical depth @xmath37 and residual intensity @xmath38 via @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the continuum level .",
    "optical depth is in turn related to column density as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the ion oscillator strength , @xmath23 is the transition wavelength expressed in  , and @xmath43 is the ion column density in @xmath44(kms^-1km@xmath17s@xmath18)@xmath18 . combining equations  [ eq : fcov ] and [ eq : n ] yields an expression for @xmath11 as a function of @xmath38 and @xmath43 . in cases where two or more transitions are measured for the same ion , from the same ground state , with different values of @xmath45 , it is possible to solve these equations for @xmath43 and @xmath11 . in the following analysis",
    "we will treat all variables as functions of velocity , i.e. , @xmath46 .    for the low ionization species of interest , our spectra",
    "cover three such transitions of si ii at 1260 , 1304 , and 1526  which we use to measure the covering fraction as a function of velocity @xmath46 , for each galaxy .",
    "si ii @xmath231304 is only used in the velocity range @xmath47 kms^-1km@xmath17s@xmath18 where it is not contaminated by o i @xmath231302 .",
    "we resample the spectrum of each transition to a common velocity scale , and find the values of @xmath43 and @xmath11 which minimize the least - square residual @xmath48 in each velocity bin .",
    "we additionally find the range of @xmath43 and @xmath11 for which @xmath49 is within 1 of the minimum value , and adopt this as the 1@xmath50 uncertainty .",
    "the best - fit @xmath11 and uncertainty calculated for each arc are shown as a function of velocity in figure  [ fig : fcov ] .",
    "since si ii is the dominant ion of silicon in h i gas , this is approximately equal to the covering fraction of h i ( provided that it is enriched with si ) which impedes the escape of ionizing radiation .",
    "a simple and complementary alternative to the method outlined in section  [ sec : fcov ] is to estimate the covering fraction from saturated transitions . in cases where @xmath51 , equation  [ eq : fcov ] simplifies to @xmath52 several of the strongest absorption lines covered by our spectra",
    "are typically saturated , including : si ii @xmath231260 , o  i @xmath231302 , si ii @xmath231304 , c ii @xmath231334 , and si ii @xmath231526 which are all tracers of h i gas . in order to minimize the statistical uncertainty",
    "we calculate the average intensity of these transitions as a function of velocity using an inverse - variance weighted mean , taking care not to use the wavelength region where o i @xmath231302 and si ii @xmath231304 are blended ( roughly @xmath53 kms^-1km@xmath17s@xmath18 depending on the kinematics of each source ) .",
    "these profiles are shown in figure  [ fig : fcov ] together with the covering fraction measured from si ii .",
    "we note that the covering fraction derived from equation  [ eq : profile ] is a strict lower limit .",
    "this work was motivated in large part by the need to disentangle kinematics and covering fractions of absorbing gas .",
    "in particular , we seek to explain the extent to which decreased absorption line equivalent widths measured from composite spectra in our earlier work @xcite result from changes in gas kinematics compared to covering fractions , and the implications of this result for the escape of ionizing radiation .",
    "we are limited in examining the redshift evolution of these properties by the small number of sources with suitable spectra , and we caution that this sample is not necessarily representative of the lbg population at these redshifts .",
    "nonetheless we can examine general trends within the existing data from this work and others in the literature @xcite .",
    "following the methods in section  [ sec : analysis ] we show the average absorption profiles and si ii covering fractions ( derived from unblended transitions at 1260 , 1526 , and 1808  ) of well - studied @xmath243 galaxies for comparison in figure  [ fig : fcov ] . to quantify trends in the absorption line profiles ,",
    "the velocity extent and maximum absorption depth for each galaxy are shown as a function of redshift in figure  [ fig : abs ] .    in the case of abell 2390",
    ", we take the most conservative approach noting that the interpretation of the absorbing gas is complicated by the physical proximity and similar redshift of the two arcs .",
    "their projected separation is @xmath54 kpc @xcite and it is unclear which source lies in the foreground . at lower redshifts , @xcite have shown that low - ionization absorption seen in a background source at @xmath55 kpc has a detectable average equivalent width @xmath56   for the transitions of interest .",
    "since we lack specific information about the 3-d geometry , the following analysis does not include any contribution from this effect .",
    "if anything , our results will overestimate the true covering fraction and therefore yield a more conservative constraint on the escape fraction .",
    "the kinematics of foreground low - ionization gas are revealed in the absorption line profiles shown in figure  [ fig : fcov ] . in all cases",
    "we see significant blueshifted absorption indicating outflows , as expected given the high star formation surface densities @xcite .",
    "the maximum outflow velocity at which absorption is detected is @xmath57 kms^-1km@xmath17s@xmath18 in a2390_h3 , with an uncertainty of @xmath58 kms^-1km@xmath17s@xmath18 since we do not directly measure the systemic redshift .",
    "a2390_h5 reveals weak absorption extending to @xmath59 kms^-1km@xmath17s@xmath18 , seen also in higher - ionization si iv and c iv lines , although it is only marginally detected at @xmath60 kms^-1km@xmath17s@xmath18 .",
    "the maximum outflow velocity in j1621 is @xmath61 kms^-1km@xmath17s@xmath18 .",
    "the outflowing low - ionization gas attains a somewhat lower ( @xmath62% on average ) maximum velocity at higher redshift .",
    "this trend is not due to lower quality data as it remains evident in figure  [ fig : fcov ] if we consider alternative measures such as the fwhm or an absorption threshold at 25% of the continuum flux .",
    "however all galaxies except j1621 have similar maximum velocities ranging from @xmath63 kms^-1km@xmath17s@xmath18 .",
    "likewise the extent of redshifted absorption is approximately @xmath64 kms^-1km@xmath17s@xmath18  for all sources , with the notable exception of the cosmic eye as discussed in detail by @xcite ; this indicates little difference in line broadening from rotation or other internal kinematic structure .",
    "therefore , in this limited sample , the low - ionization gas kinematics are similar with a somewhat lower average velocity extent at higher redshift .      the covering fraction of each galaxy as a function of gas velocity",
    "is estimated from the methods described in section  [ sec : analysis ] and shown in figure  [ fig : fcov ] .",
    "both methods are generally in good agreement indicating that equation  [ eq : profile ] is a valid approximation .",
    "si ii covering fractions derived for the cosmic eye are systematically higher than indicated by the average absorption profile ; this is largely an artifact caused by additional absorption at the wavelength of si ii @xmath231260 from intervening gas at @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "it is also apparent from figure  [ fig : fcov ] that the si ii covering fraction is poorly constrained in regions of weak absorption due to the marginal significance of individual absorption lines .",
    "this is most problematic in the high - velocity wings .",
    "the strong anticorrelation between absorption line strength and covering fraction , as well as results at lower redshift @xcite , suggest that the most likely solution for such ambiguous cases is a low covering fraction of optically thick gas .",
    "we therefore opt to compare galaxies on the basis of their average absorption line profile as this quantity is simpler to define and less susceptible to the uncertainties described above .",
    "nonetheless the si ii results are an important verification that the average profile accurately traces @xmath11 .",
    "we can now compare the covering fractions measured at @xmath66 with sources at lower redshift .",
    "figure  [ fig : abs ] shows the maximum absorption depth for each galaxy as a function of redshift .",
    "the @xmath66 galaxies have maximum absorption depths corresponding to @xmath670.9 , in each case occurring at @xmath68 kms^-1km@xmath17s@xmath18 .",
    "there is a large scatter in figure  [ fig : abs ] with @xmath69 and no strong redshift dependence .",
    "galaxies at @xmath66 do , however , have covering fractions which are lower on average by 25% or @xmath70 compared to @xmath243 .",
    "we now turn to trends with ly@xmath0  equivalent width .",
    "previous sections focused on possible redshift evolution of low - ionization absorption lines in our quest to examine whether this may signify an increasing ionizing escape fraction .",
    "the connection with ly@xmath0  is a natural one to explore given there is a strong correlation between its equivalent width @xmath71 and low - ionization absorption @xcite .",
    "since our previous work has suggested that the distribution of @xmath71 for lbgs of a fixed luminosity increases with redshift @xcite , we can hope to derive inferences about the low ionization absorption in sources for which ly@xmath0  measurements are now widely available .",
    "each galaxy in figure  [ fig : abs ] is color - coded according to @xmath71 .",
    "this value refers only to the equivalent width of ly@xmath0  emission , differing from the conventional net sum of emission and absorption .",
    "the maximum outflow velocity is lower on average in galaxies with stronger ly@xmath0  emission , consistent with well - quantified results from composite spectra @xcite .",
    "more interestingly , figure  [ fig : abs ] reveals a trend of lower absorption depth ( implying lower @xmath11 ) with stronger ly@xmath0  emission at @xmath72 significance .",
    "we show this relation in figure  [ fig : lya ] .",
    "in contrast , the trend of lower average @xmath11 at higher redshift has limited significance ( @xmath73 ) and is explained by ly@xmath0  demographics within the sample . although limited by the small sample size , this is an important first quantitative result at these redshifts . since the frequency and equivalent width of ly@xmath0  emission increases in lbgs at higher @xmath74 ,",
    "these results imply that the average covering fraction of low - ionization gas should decrease with redshift .",
    "direct measurements of the ionizing flux are impractical at the redshifts of interest in this paper both because of the faint apparent magnitudes of lbgs and the high opacity of the ly@xmath0  forest .",
    "nonetheless we can provide important constraints on @xmath5 using indirect tracers of h i.    before doing so , we consider the potential systematic uncertainties which may limit our ability to estimate the true value of @xmath5 from metal absorption lines .",
    "results at @xmath2 have shown that @xmath5 is indeed dependent on low - ionization absorption strength @xcite although this relation is not one - to - one , likely due to the factors described below . while in general these preclude accurate estimates of the escape fraction , the maximum absorption depth ( figures  [ fig : fcov ] , [ fig : abs ] ) is a valuable constraint on h i spatial homogeneity and sets a stringent upper limit on @xmath5 .    \\1 .",
    "we measure covering fraction as a function of velocity , yet gas at different velocities may cover different spatial regions and we lack the spatial resolution needed to evaluate this effect .",
    "the maximum absorption depth _ at a given velocity _ is thus a lower limit on the total h i covering fraction and an upper limit on @xmath5 .",
    "metal - free h i is not detected .",
    "to date only two instances of metal - free gas have been found at these redshifts @xcite and so this is likely insignificant .",
    "again , this possibility implies that covering fractions measured in section  [ sec : analysis ] yield upper limits on @xmath5 .",
    "low column density gas will not be detected , although such gas will not affect @xmath5 unless it has very low metallicity @xmath75 z@xmath76 .",
    "the optical depth of metal transitions used here compared to lyman continuum at @xmath77   is @xmath78 for the weakest line ( si ii @xmath231304 ) and 1020 for the strongest transitions",
    "( si ii @xmath231260 , c ii @xmath231334 ,",
    "o i @xmath231302 ) for solar abundance ratios @xcite .",
    "galaxies in the @xmath243 sample with measured interstellar abundance ratios have z @xmath79 z@xmath76 for the relevant elements , such that the attenuation of weaker si lines is roughly equal to that of ionizing radiation .",
    ". there may be narrow components with uniform covering fraction which are spectroscopically unresolved .",
    "however , such smooth absorption and column density profiles would require a remarkably regular spacing of discrete narrow components , and so a partial covering fraction appears more likely ( see @xcite ) .",
    "si ii and c ii are present in both h i and h ii regions .",
    "we have therefore confirmed that o i , with essentially the same ionization potential as h i , gives consistent results in all cases .",
    "we measure a covering fraction at 12601526  , but the stars which are bright at these wavelengths do not necessarily emit at @xmath80912  .",
    "our measurements therefore correspond to a constraint on the relative escape fraction @xmath81 as commonly used in the literature . however , the spatial distribution of @xmath82 is similar to ionizing emission as traced by balmer lines in @xmath83 galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , indicating that this effect may be minimal .    with these caveats in mind",
    ", we now summarize what can be learned about the ionizing escape fraction at @xmath66 .",
    "the depth of low - ionization absorption lines gives upper limits @xmath84 for a2390_h5 , @xmath85 for a2390_h3 , and @xmath86 for j1621 .",
    "the true values are likely well below the upper limits and in three lower - redshift galaxies we can verify that this is the case .",
    "@xcite show that the cosmic eye has an h i covering fraction of @xmath87% implying @xmath88 based on damped ly@xmath0  absorption , more stringent than the @xmath89 from our analysis .",
    "secondly , no ionizing radiation is detected from the horseshoe in deep uv imaging ( b. siana , private communication ) nor from the spectrum of q0000-d6 ( @xmath90 ; @xcite ) despite low maximum covering fractions ( figures  [ fig : fcov ] , [ fig : abs ] ) .",
    "non - uniform coverage of low - ionization metals is evidently a necessary , but not sufficient , condition for the escape of ionizing radiation .",
    "results derived in this paper should therefore be strictly interpreted as upper limits .",
    "nonetheless , our measurements at @xmath66 are readily compatible with the value @xmath91 required for galaxies to reionize the universe @xcite .",
    "in our previous work @xcite we found a decrease in the low - ionization absorption equivalent width with redshift in composite lbg spectra , but were unable to distinguish whether gas kinematics and/or covering fraction were the cause .",
    "the new data presented in this paper now resolve this ambiguity .",
    "although the sample of lbgs with high quality spectra at @xmath92 is small and not necessarily representative , the present data show an approximately equal decrease of @xmath93% in the gas velocity and covering fraction with redshift .",
    "the much stronger dependence of low - ionization absorption with ly@xmath0  emission appears to be predominantly due to the covering fraction of neutral hydrogen .",
    "the main limitation of methods used in this work to constrain @xmath5 is that we do not directly measure the fraction of ionizing emission covered by h i. while the spectrally - resolved covering fraction of heavy elements provides an important measure of the `` patchiness '' of h i , gas at different velocities may cover different spatial regions and so we can derive only a lower ( upper ) limit on @xmath11 ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "deep integral field spectroscopy with good spatial resolution may resolve this issue and provide better constraints on @xmath11 and @xmath5 .",
    "we have successfully measured the kinematics and covering fraction of low - ionization ( h  i ) gas in @xmath66 lbgs from high quality rest - uv spectra .",
    "resulting upper limits on the ionizing escape fraction @xmath94 are readily consistent with that required for star - forming galaxies to reionize the universe ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "importantly , the new data enable these measurements at a time @xmath95 gyr from the reionization epoch , much earlier than was previously possible .",
    "we note that in order for galaxies to reionize the universe , the escape fraction must increase rapidly from @xmath96 measured at @xmath9 @xcite to a value @xmath91 at @xmath97 @xcite .",
    "while the trends with redshift are poorly constrained , the available data reveal a reduced covering fraction with increasing @xmath71 indicating that galaxies with moderate or strong ly@xmath0  emission are likely to have larger @xmath5 .",
    "this is supported by direct evidence at @xmath9 , where galaxies with detectable ionizing flux have stronger ly@xmath0  emission and weaker low - ionization absorption than lbgs with lower @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "clearly the distribution of ( metal - enriched ) h i is patchier in galaxies with stronger ly@xmath0  emission , and therefore more likely that ionizing radiation can escape .",
    "since the frequency and strength of ly@xmath0  emission in typical lbgs increases with redshift @xcite , our results provide new evidence that the covering fractions decrease ( and therefore @xmath5 increases ) with redshift .",
