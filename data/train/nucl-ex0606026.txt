    "elliptic flow in relativistic nuclear interactions has its origin in the spatial anisotropy of the initial reaction volume in non - central collisions and in particle rescatterings in the evolving system which convert the spatial anisotropy into a momentum anisotropy  @xcite .",
    "the spatial anisotropy decreases rapidly because of the fast expansion of the system  @xcite making the momentum anisotropy measured at the end of this evolution strongly dependent on the matter properties and the equation of state ( eos ) at the early stage  @xcite .",
    "comparison of measured anisotropies with hydrodynamic model calculations provide an important test of the degree of thermalisation in the produced particle system at the early stage .",
    "flow of heavy particles is affected more strongly by changes in the eos than flow of pions  @xcite .",
    "the anisotropic flow parameters measured to date at sps and lower energies are mainly those of pions and protons  @xcite .",
    "rhic experiments have measured elliptic flow for many particle species  @xcite , including hyperons  @xcite . in these experiments ,",
    "the rapid rise of elliptic flow with transverse momentum ( @xmath3 ) up to 1.5  and its particle - mass dependence are well reproduced by hydrodynamic models  @xcite . at higher values of @xmath3 quark number",
    "scaling of elliptic flow has been observed at rhic  @xcite which indicates that the quark coalescence mechanism dominates hadron production in the intermediate @xmath3 region  @xcite . in order to test the validity of this scenario at sps energies we have extended elliptic flow measurements in 158  pb+pb ( @xmath4 gev ) collisions to @xmath0 hyperons . in this paper , results on @xmath0 elliptic flow as a function of the center of mass rapidity ( @xmath5 ) and transverse momentum",
    "will be presented and compared to model calculations .",
    "the main components of the na49 detector  @xcite are four large - volume time projection chambers ( tpcs ) for tracking and particle identification by energy loss ( @xmath6/@xmath7 ) measurement with a resolution of 3@xmath86% .",
    "the tpc system consists of two vertex chambers inside the spectrometer magnets and two main chambers placed behind the magnets at both sides of the beam .",
    "downstream of the tpcs a veto calorimeter detects projectile spectators and is used for triggering and centrality selection .",
    "the data sample consists of @xmath9 semi - central pb+pb events after online trigger selection of the 23.5% most central collisions .",
    "the events were divided into three different centrality bins , which correspond to the first three bins used in a previous analysis ( see table 1 in  @xcite ) and are defined by centrality ranges 0 - 5% ( bin 1 ) , 5 - 12.5% ( bin 2 ) , and 12.5 - 23.5% ( bin 3 ) .",
    "many model predictions are published for impact parameter ranges similar to those of our centrality classes , which are : 0 - 3.4 fm ( bin 1 ) , 3.4 - 5.3 fm ( bin 2 ) , and 5.3 - 7.4 fm ( bin 3 ) for our centrality classes .",
    "the measurement in the centrality range @xmath10 = 5@xmath823.5% ( called mid - central ) is obtained by averaging the results of bins 2 plus 3 with weights corresponding to the fractions of the total cross section in these bins .",
    "the @xmath0 hyperon candidates were selected from the sample of v@xmath11-track configurations consisting of oppositely charged particles , which include the @xmath0 decays into proton and @xmath12 ( branching ratio 63.9% ) .",
    "the identification method  @xcite relies on the evaluation of the invariant mass distribution and is enhanced by daughter particle identification applying a cut in @xmath6/@xmath7 around the expectation value derived from a bethe - bloch parametrization .",
    "the extracted @xmath0 candidates have a background contamination of 5 - 9% in the p-@xmath13 invariant mass window 1.108@xmath81.124 , depending on centrality .",
    "the yields of @xmath0 hyperons are obtained by counting the number of entries in the invariant mass peak above the estimated background as a function of the azimuthal angle @xmath14 of @xmath0 candidates with respect to the event plane angle @xmath15 .",
    "the background is estimated from a fit of invariant mass spectra to the sum of a lorentz distribution and a polynomial .",
    "it is subtracted in 16 bins of @xmath16 .",
    "the acceptance of @xmath0 hyperons covers the range @xmath17  and @xmath18 but the detection efficiency strongly depends on azimuthal angle , @xmath3 and @xmath5",
    ". thus we have to introduce differential corrections to avoid biases when averaging @xmath1 over rapidity and transverse momentum .",
    "multiplicative factors were introduced for every @xmath0 particle to correct the @xmath0 yields for detector and reconstruction efficiency .",
    "they were determined as ratios of published @xmath0 yields  @xcite , parametrized by the blast wave model , to the measured raw @xmath0 yields .",
    "the elliptic flow analysis is based on the standard procedure outlined in  @xcite to reconstruct the event plane for each event and the corrections for the event plane resolution .",
    "the event plane is an experimental estimator of the true reaction plane and is calculated from the azimuthal distribution of primary charged @xmath13 mesons .",
    "identification of pions is based on @xmath6/@xmath7 measurements in the tpcs . to avoid",
    "possible auto - correlations , tracks associated with @xmath0 candidates are excluded from the event plane calculation . the method to determine the event plane azimuthal angle @xmath15 uses the elliptic flow of pions , according to the formula : @xmath19 , \\nonumber \\\\ & y_{2}&= \\sum_{i=1}^{n}p^{i}_{{\\mbox{\\textrm{\\scriptsize t } } } } [ \\sin(2\\phi^{i})-\\langle \\sin(2\\phi)\\rangle ] ,   \\\\ & { \\ensuremath{\\phi_{{\\mbox{\\textrm{\\scriptsize 2ep}}}}}}&= \\frac{1}{2 } \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{y_{{\\mbox{\\textrm{\\scriptsize 2}}}}}{x_{{\\mbox{\\textrm{\\scriptsize 2}}}}}\\right ) , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 are the components of the event plane flow vector @xmath21 and the sums run over accepted charged pion tracks in an event .",
    "the acceptance correction is based on the recentering method  @xcite which consists of subtracting in eq .  1 the mean values @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "these mean values are calculated in bins of @xmath3 and rapidity for all pions in those events which contain at least one @xmath0 hyperon candidate .",
    "the values were stored in a 3-dimensional matrix of 20 @xmath3 intervals , 50 rapidity intervals , and eight centrality bins .",
    "a second level acceptance correction is done by using mixed events .",
    "hyperons with respect to the event plane for real events ( solid symbols ) and mixed - events ( open symbols ) in two centrality bins .",
    "the curves are fourier expansion fits ( see text eq .",

    "a comparison of @xmath1 of pions and protons obtained by na49  @xcite and star  @xcite for mid - central collisions is shown in fig .",

    ", @xmath1 of pions also rises faster with @xmath3 at rhic than at sps .",
    "protons seem to exhibit a similar trend , but the limited @xmath3 range and the larger measurement errors do not allow a firm conclusion .    a comparison of @xmath33 for pions , protons and @xmath0 hyperons as measured by the na49 experiment in mid - central events is displayed in fig .",
    "the elliptic flow grows linearly with @xmath3 for all particle species but the rise for pions starts from @xmath3 close to zero while for protons and @xmath0 particles it starts from @xmath35  .",
    "the elliptic flow for pions is significantly larger than that for heavier particles although at @xmath36  the flow becomes similar for all particle species .",

    "the values of freeze - out temperature and expansion rapidity are consistent with those obtained from @xmath41 spectra and bose - einstein correlations  @xcite . in fig .  5 the measured values of @xmath1",
    "are also compared to hydrodynamical model calculations  @xcite assuming a first - order phase transition to a qgp at the critical temperature @xmath42 mev .",
    "the initial conditions employed for the hydrodynamical calculations at sps are : initial energy density @xmath43  =  9.0  @xmath44 , baryon density @xmath45  =  1.1  @xmath46 , thermalization time @xmath47  =  0.8  @xmath48 .",
    "the initial conditions were fixed as in  @xcite by requiring a good fit to the @xmath3 spectra of protons and negatively charged particles in central pb+pb collisions at the sps . with the freeze - out temperature @xmath49 mev tuned to reproduce particle spectra , the model calculations significantly overestimate the sps results for semi - central collisions ( full curves in fig .  5 ) in contrast to predictions at rhic energy which agree quite well with data for @xmath50  @xcite ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "the discrepancy at sps may indicate a lack of complete thermalisation or a viscosity effect .",
    "however , the model reproduces qualitatively the characteristic hadron - mass ordering of elliptic flow .",
    "thus the data support the hypothesis of early development of collectivity . on the other hand ,",
    "the magnitude and trends of elliptic flow , measured by the second fourier coefficient @xmath1 is found to be underpredicted by a hadronic cascade model  @xcite .",
    "a more comprehensive description of experimental results was found by coupling a hadronic rescattering phase to the hydrodynamical evolution and hadronisation  @xcite .",
    "this model can reproduce @xmath41 spectra and elliptic flow both at top sps energy and rhic consistently , although predictions of @xmath1 for exactly the centrality range of the present analysis are not published in the literature .",
    "one should note , however , that none of the hydrodynamical models have yet been able to describe bose - einstein correlations successfully .",

    "the na49 measurements ( fig .",
    "6 , top ) are consistent with this result in the @xmath3 range covered by the data .",
    "the deviation of the pions from the universal curve has been attributed to the goldstone nature of the pion ( its mass is smaller than the sum of masses of its constituent quarks ) or to the effect of resonance decays  @xcite .",
    "the variable @xmath56 , where @xmath41 is the transverse mass and @xmath57 the rest mass of the particle , was proposed in  @xcite as an alternative to @xmath3 since pressure gradients which give rise to azimuthal asymmetry may naturally lead to collective transverse energy of produced particles .",

    "hydrodynamic models with a deconfinement phase transition and a microscopic freezeout treatment appear to provide a consistent description of @xmath1 and @xmath41 spectra at both top sps and rhic energies  @xcite .",
    "quark number scaling of elliptic flow ( @xmath51 versus @xmath53 ) was shown to hold also at the sps .",
