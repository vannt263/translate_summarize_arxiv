    "this paper is a glance at a generalization of the space of ultrafilters over @xmath1 , the stone - ech compactification of the natural numbers , or just @xmath0 . the space @xmath0 and its remainder , the space @xmath4 , are well - studied spaces with a lot of interesting properties .",
    "for example both spaces are quasicompact and hausdorff and therefore , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are banach algebras",
    ".    we shall provide the reader with a very general approach to ultrafilter spaces on arbitrary semilattices , but the main focus of this paper is a particular class of ultrafilter spaces because of their intimate category theoretical connection with the stone - ech compactification : spaces of ultrafilters on the semilattice of partitions .",
    "these objects are indeed the dualization of @xmath0 in the following category theoretical sense :    look at the category of sets @xmath7 . as usual for any object @xmath8 we define the subobjects of @xmath9 to be the equivalence classes of monos and @xmath10 are defined to be equivalent iff there is an isomorphism @xmath11 such that @xmath12 . ] ( _ i.e. _ , in the category of sets , injections ) with codomain @xmath9 . the collection @xmath13 of subobjects of @xmath9 is partially ordered by @xmath14\\leq [ g ] : \\iff \\exists h : a\\to b ( f = gh),\\ ] ] when @xmath15 and @xmath10 .    indeed , in this case @xmath13 is a boolean algebra with greatest element @xmath16 $ ] and least element @xmath17 $ ] where @xmath18 is the unique morphism with codomain @xmath9 whose domain is the initial object of the category @xmath7 ( the empty set ) .",
    "the stone - ech compactification @xmath0 is the space of ultrafilters in the boolean algebra @xmath19 .",
    "we can now dualize by reversing all occurring arrows : the dualization of @xmath13 is the collection @xmath20 of all equivalence classes of epis and @xmath21 are defined to be equivalent iff there is an isomorphism @xmath22 such that @xmath23 . ]",
    "( _ i.e. _ , in the category of sets , surjections ) with domain @xmath9 , which we will call the * cosubobjects * of @xmath9 . again , this collection is partially ordered by @xmath14\\leq [ g ] : \\iff \\exists h : b\\to a ( f = hg),\\ ] ] when @xmath24 and @xmath21 .    moving from the abstract to the concrete",
    ", in the category of sets , a cosubobject of @xmath1 is just an equivalence class of surjective functions with domain @xmath1 modulo permutation of their ranges .",
    "this gives us a partition of @xmath1 by looking at the preimages of singletons of elements of the range of such functions .",
    "note that following this translation , the relation @xmath25 defined on @xmath20 just gives us the `` is coarser than '' relation on partitions .",
    "thus @xmath26 is again a partially ordered structure and its space of ultrafilters is in this sense the dualization of the stone - ech compactification @xmath0 .    the important distinction between infinite sets and finite sets in the stone - ech compactification that allows to distinguish between principal ultrafilters ( _ i.e. _ , the representants of the countable dense subset @xmath1 of @xmath0 ) and non - principal ultrafilters becomes dualized to the distinction between partitions into infinitely many classes and partitions into finitely many classes . can be categorially expressed by use of the dedekind formalization of finiteness ( using the axiom of choice ) : @xmath27 $ ] is finite if and only if every mono from the domain of @xmath28 to itself is an isomorphism . ]    but the move from subobjects to cosubobjects changes quite a lot : we will see in this paper that @xmath26 can not be a boolean algebra .",
    "an immediate consequence of this lack of a complementation function is that some variations of techniques , that were merely different viewpoints in the case of the stone - ech compactification , now actually give different topological spaces .",
    "we will show that spaces that are homeomorphic in the classical case fall apart in the dual case , especially two consequences of compactness , countable compactness and the hausdorff separation property , belong to two different spaces in the dual case  so none of the possible dualization of the stone - ech compactification is compact anymore",
    ".    this alone should be enough motivation to delve deeper into that subject matter to get more information about these spaces and find the most natural dualization of @xmath0 .",
    "we close our paper with an extensive list of projects and open problems that result from these non - homeomorphicity results .",
    "many areas of application for the stone - ech compactification that are nowadays very well understood deserve to be explored in our dual case .",
    "we will restrict our attention in this paper to partitions which consist solely of infinite blocks .",
    "there is no innate category theoretical reason behind this , but we believe that the additional information that the size of a block might convey could add unwanted combinatorial phenomena to the theory of spaces of partition ultrafilters .",
    "after all , set - theoretically speaking , the elements of a subset of @xmath1 also do not carry an additional information about their size , so we try to avoid hidden information by restricting our attention to partitions with large blocks , and thus receive some sort of homogeneity .    for readers interested in other approaches , we mention this restriction ( and a possible lifting of it ) in section  [ sec : open ] .",
    "in this section we define topologies on the set of ultrafilters on semilattices .      a * semilattice * @xmath29 consists of a set @xmath30 , a least element @xmath31 and a partial ordering @xmath32 on @xmath30 such that for all @xmath33 we have the following : there is a @xmath34 with @xmath35 and @xmath36 , and for every @xmath37 with @xmath38 and @xmath39 we have @xmath40 ( the * infimum * of @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) which we denote as usual by @xmath43 . furthermore , for each @xmath44 , the least element @xmath45 should satisfy @xmath46 . a semilattice without a least element",
    "can easily be supplemented by one .",
    "furthermore , an element @xmath44 is called an * atom * if for all @xmath47 we have either @xmath48 or @xmath49 .",
    "a semilattice is said to be * downward splitting * if below each @xmath44 which is not an atom there are @xmath50 and @xmath51 such that @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .",
    "let @xmath55 be a semilattice .",
    "two elements @xmath33 are called * orthogonal * , and we write @xmath56 if @xmath57 . otherwise , they are called * compatible*. if we want to stress the connection between the relations @xmath58 and @xmath32 , we write @xmath59 .    a semilattice @xmath60 is called * complemented * if there is a function @xmath61 satisfying    * @xmath62 , * @xmath63 .",
    "complemented semilattices are extremely well - behaved : we can define the reverse relation by stipulating @xmath64 iff @xmath65 .",
    "then @xmath66 is a semilattice with least element @xmath67 ( where @xmath31 is the least element of @xmath60 ) and the semilattice @xmath68 is isomorphic to @xmath69 via the map @xmath70 .",
    "the semilattice we are mainly interested in is the semilattice of partitions of @xmath1 .    a * partition * @xmath71 ( of @xmath1 ) consisting of pairwise disjoint , non - empty sets such that @xmath72 .",
    "the elements of a partition are called the * blocks*.    we elaborated in section [ sec : int ] on the possibility of a categorial definition as cosubobjects of @xmath1 and why we will only consider partitions of @xmath1 all of whose blocks are infinite sets .",
    "so , in the following the word `` partition '' by convention always refers to partitions of @xmath1 all of whose blocks are infinite .",
    "we also consider finite partitions , this means partitions containing finitely many blocks , and the partition containing only one block is denoted by @xmath73 .",
    "the set of all partitions is denoted by @xmath74 , the set of all partitions containing infinitely ( resp.finitely ) many blocks is denoted by @xmath75 ( resp.@xmath76 ) .",
    "let @xmath71 and @xmath77 be two partitions .",
    "we say @xmath71 is * coarser * than @xmath77 , or that @xmath77 is * finer * than @xmath71 ( and write @xmath78 ) if each block of @xmath71 is the union of blocks of @xmath77 .",
    "let @xmath79 denote the finest partition which is coarser than @xmath71 and @xmath77 .",
    "similarly , @xmath80 denotes the coarsest partition which is finer than @xmath71 and @xmath77 .    in the following",
    "we investigate the semilattices @xmath81 and @xmath82 , and in section  [ sec : inf ] we will investigate @xmath83 .",
    "notice that the least element @xmath31 in @xmath84 is @xmath85 , whereas the set @xmath86 does not have a least element on its own , so we have to add one .",
    "because they figure prominently in the lattice theoretical description of @xmath0 , we also mention the two well - known semilattices @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the power - set of @xmath1 , and @xmath89^{\\omega}_{{}^{\\subseteq}}:={\\langle}{[\\omega ] ^\\omega } , { \\subseteq}{\\rangle}$ ] , where @xmath90^\\omega } $ ] is the set of all infinite subsets of @xmath1 . as we noted in section",

    "the cyrillic letter `` @xmath111 '' for the sound `` yu '' should remind the reader of the `` u '' in `` ultrafilter '' . note that we make use of the assumption that the semilattice has a least element : although we could get rid of the mention of @xmath112 in the definition of filter by postulating @xmath113 instead of @xmath114 , we can not prove fact [ fct : zorn ] without the least element . to see this ,",
    "look at an arbitrary linear order @xmath115 without least element .",
    "filters are just endsegments of @xmath60 , but there can be no maximal proper endsegment .",

    "we can define topologies on @xmath110 in two different ways :    first define for each @xmath44 two sets @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "set @xmath119 and @xmath120 and call the topology generated by @xmath121 the * positive topology * @xmath122 and the topology generated by @xmath123 the * negative topology * @xmath124 on @xmath110 .",

    "we shall call a topological space * principal * if it contains an open set with just one element .",

    "the nice characterization of proposition [ prop : principal ] does not work in the case of the negative topologies , since the existence of closed singletons ( which would be the analogue of being a principal space for the negative topologies ) is provable in general regardless of the existence of principal ultrafilters :    for any semilattice @xmath60 , the spaces @xmath140 and @xmath163 are @xmath164 spaces ( _ i.e. _ , all singletons are closed ) .",
