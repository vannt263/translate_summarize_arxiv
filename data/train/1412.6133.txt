    "protocol sequences , which were first introduced in  @xcite , provide feedback - free solutions for media access control ( mac ) in communication networks .",
    "while the dominant mac standards for cell - based systems , including cellular networks and wireless lan s , are feedback - based , the feedback - free approach has a strong appeal to networks without a backbone hierarchy .",
    "for example , recent works have begun to explore the application of protocol sequences to ad hoc networks , such as _ vehicular ad hoc network _ ( vanet )  @xcite .",
    "a fundamental challenge in mac design is due to the lack of synchronicity among different users who try to access the shared medium .",
    "protocol sequences are constructed specifically to handle the asynchronous reality .",
    "intuitively , a good design should ensure that no matter how the sequences are shifted with respect to one another , each sequence should permit its affiliated user to transmit at least one packet without suffering interference from other users .",
    "protocol sequence sets with this property are commonly referred to as possessing the user - irrepressible ( ui ) property  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that an important approach to construct ui protocol sequence sets is by means of cac , which stands for conflict - avoiding codes @xcite .",
    "therefore , there is a close tie between protocol sequences and cac .",
    "the objective of finding ui protocol sequence sets with large number of sequence elements with short sequence period can be transformed to finding cac sets with large code size and short code length .",
    "although it is difficult to ensure precise user - synchronicity in multi - user communication systems , in many applications it is relatively easy to maintain some rough degree of user synchronicity .",
    "for example , mobile users may have access to a global clock via the gps , which provides rough time synchronization .",
    "however , due to propagation delays and other engineering restrictions , transmitted signals can not be completely synchronized ( see for example @xcite ) . for partially synchronous applications , protocol sequence sets",
    "are only required to observe the ui property for relative shifts up to a certain magnitude .    in this paper , we define a partial shift version of user - irrepressible sequence sets in section  [ sec : ui ] .",
    "two prior known constructions : tdma and code - based scheduling ( via galois field or reed - solomon code ) , are then introduced to provide some quick baseline comparison .",
    "next , we introduce a new concept , called partially conflict - avoiding code ( pcac ) , in order to build a partially user - irrepressible sequence set . the definition of a partially conflict - avoiding code will be given in section  [ sec : combin ] together with its graphic representation .",
    "a useful tool in combinatorial design called disjoint difference set is also introduced . in section  [ sec : mainresult ] we provide a few families of partially user - irrepressible sequence sets by means of disjoint difference sets .",
    "comparison of the pcac approach with tdma and code - based scheduling will also be given in section  [ sec : mainresult ] .",
    "finally , we study the optimal partially conflict - avoiding codes of small weights in section  [ sec : pcac23 ] .",

    ", @xmath2 , on @xmath1 is defined by @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes the @xmath5-th component of @xmath1 .",
    "the following definition is an extension of _ user - irrepressible _ property which is proposed in @xcite .",

    "consider a sequence set with @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) elements , each having a length @xmath0 .",

    "denote by @xmath13 the @xmath14 matrix obtained by stacking any @xmath15 representations one above the other .",
    "the sequence set is _ @xmath16-user - irrepressible _ ( ui for short ) if we can always find a @xmath17 submatrix of @xmath13 which is a permutation matrix .",
    "an @xmath16-ui sequence set is obviously a solution to the problem we formulated in section  [ sec : intro ] . throughout this paper ,",
    "we use @xmath9 , @xmath15 , and @xmath0 to denote respectively the number of potential users in a system , the maximum number of active users at any time , and the common sequence period .",
    "it is not hard to find an @xmath16-ui sequence set .",
    "one simple way is based on the tdma approach . for @xmath18 , let @xmath19 be the binary sequence of length @xmath20 composed of all zeroes except for the @xmath21-th position , that is , @xmath22",
    ". then @xmath23 is obviously an @xmath16-ui sequence set of length @xmath24 and size @xmath25 . in practice , however , the set size @xmath9 is in theory larger than @xmath15 .",
    "an alternative construction for the case where @xmath9 is much larger than @xmath15 is based on galois fields . after appending @xmath26 ` zeroes ' to all entries of each sequence constructed in @xcite , we have the following result .",

    "it is worth mentioning that in @xcite , a solution based on reed - solomon codes was proposed which has the same order behavior .",
    "in this section , we define the new concept of partially conflict - avoiding codes and introduce two relevant combinatorial structures for analyzing them : graph packings and disjoint difference sets .",
    "the connection of these terms with ui sequence sets will be shown as    @xmath35      given a binary sequence @xmath1 , the _ weight _ of @xmath1 , denoted by @xmath37 , is the number of ` ones ' in it . for integers @xmath38 , let @xmath39 denote the set of all binary sequences of length @xmath0 and weight @xmath15 .",
