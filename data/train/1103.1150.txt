    "as shown in @xcite , the environmental correlation function corresponds to the autocorrelation value of this noise , i.e. @xmath19 , and in agreement with the fluctuation - dissipation theorem turns out to be a time dependent memory - kernel for the particle energy dissipation . exploiting the analogous properties of the environmental correlation function and the spectral correlation matrix we investigate the validity of the non - trivial semigroup evolution for the many channel decay and identify the necessary conditions with the well - known markovian limit @xcite . in this way we consider a natural imbedding of the wigner - weisskopf idea into a theory of interaction with a reservoir ( e.g. , generalization of anderson and fano @xcite and lee s formulation ) .",

    "by associating the spectral weights of the wigner - weisskopf model for unstable system decay with the statistical properties of coupling to an environment , we were able to characterize the reduced evolution in the subspace of unstable states in terms of the spectral correlation matrix . exploiting the properties of the latter",
    ", we showed that the markovian limit distribution is sufficient to account for semigroup behavior for an arbitrary number of the decay channels , observed in experiment , such as in @xcite .",
    "besides the important impact of the spectral correlation matrix notion for understanding the reduced evolution of the multi - channel decays , such as the two - channel k - meson decay @xcite , it is clear that the association of the coupling to a spectral continuum with an environment may be similarly useful for any analogously modeled theory .",
    "we thank dr .",
    "y. strauss for discussion of analogous results obtained by nagy - foias - kolmogorov dilation @xcite , in which the quantum mechanical problem is imbedded in a larger space as in the work of maassen @xcite , who constructs a fock space resulting in the generation of a  noisy environment \" of the type we have discussed .",
    "in this appendix we discuss the structure of the reduced propagator in the complex laplace plane .",
    "we specifically show that the propagator has poles only in the lower half plane near the real axis and also provide the background needed for establishing the connection between the reduced system evolution generator and the spectral density matrix eq .",
    "( [ wvsalpha ] ) . following the well - known procedure @xcite",
    "let us rewrite eq .",
    "( [ r ] ) as @xmath159 here the operator @xmath160 with @xmath161 and @xmath110 given by eqs .",
    "( [ h0s],[hatomega ] ) respectively , is found straightforwardly from the projection of the total system propagator on the discrete subspace .",
    "the last term of eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) can be recognized as the laplace transform ( for @xmath162 ) of the spectral correlation matrix @xmath16 eq .",
    "( [ alphai ] ) : @xmath163@xmath164 to obtain a singularity in @xmath26 eq .",
    "( [ rvsh ] ) we need that the determinant of @xmath165 eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) vanishes .",
    "these non - hermitian matrices can be put into jordan canonical form with a unitary transformation , with eigenvalues along the diagonal .",
    "a vanishing eigenvalue implies a vanishing determinant .",
    "we therefore can ask whether @xmath165 has a vanishing eigenvalue , i.e. @xmath166|\\chi(z)\\rangle_{\\rm r}=0,\\label{hchi}\\ ] ] where @xmath167 is the right eigenvector of @xmath165 with the presumed zero eigenvalue .",
    "taking the scalar product with @xmath168 eigenvector from the left yields @xmath169@xmath170 in general , for the convergence of the integral in the last expression , we must assume that @xmath110 decreases better than an , no matter how small , inverse power of @xmath96 since the integral contains @xmath171 for very large @xmath96 .",
    "now we consider the imaginary part of eq .",
    "( [ chihchi ] ) .",
    "since @xmath161 is hermitian , its expectation value in the state @xmath167 is real , and we are left with @xmath172 i.e. , @xmath173 times a positive quantity .",
    "this can never be zero for @xmath37 on the first riemann sheet .",
    "we are therefore required to go to the second sheet : @xmath174 @xmath175 here @xmath40 and @xmath176 are the smooth continuations of @xmath26 and @xmath165 into the lower half plane and @xmath177 is the analytic continuation of the spectral correlation matrix @xmath178 eq .",
    "( [ alphaz ] ) , where @xmath179 is the analytic continuation of @xmath110 into the lower half plane .",
    "the condition for a vanishing eigenvalue eq .",
    "( [ chihchi ] ) now reads @xmath169@xmath180 taking the imaginary part as before gives @xmath181@xmath182 so that there may be a solution for @xmath183 negative , since @xmath110 is positive definite .",
    "it is easy to see that the expectation of @xmath110 is the sum of absolute squares ; the analytic continuation of @xmath110 to the lower half plane for small imaginary part of @xmath35 , enough to reach a resonance pole , is assumed to remain approximately real since it is smoothly connected to real values of @xmath110 , for @xmath96 on the real line . in the markovian limit this function is taken to approach a constant .",
