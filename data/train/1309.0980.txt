    "the deviation ( [ deviation ] ) can be explained very well by the extra contributions from low - energy susy in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "however , a tension between @xmath7 , which prefers light susy particles , and lhc - results , which rule out certain mssm parameter regions with light coloured susy particles , seems to develop . in the general mssm",
    "there is no problem to accommodate all constraints simultaneously @xcite , but in more specific models , such as the constrained mssm @xcite or the scenarios of refs.@xcite motivated by the little hierarchy problem , it has become impossible to explain the deviation ( [ deviation ] ) .",
    "hence the new experimental input has motivated the construction and analysis of many new susy models and scenarios . some involve compressed spectra @xcite to allow lighter coloured susy particles without contradicting lhc limits .",
    "some go beyond the mssm and reconcile the higgs mass with @xmath7 by lifting the higgs mass with extra matter @xcite or gauge bosons @xcite .",
    "many recently proposed models which stay within the mssm framework involve rather split spectra , e.g.  heavy coloured , light non - coloured susy particles @xcite , heavy third family , lighter first and second family @xcite , non - universal gaugino masses @xcite , large higgsino masses and large stop mixing from more generic gauge mediation @xcite .    not only the lhc data but also the @xmath7 measurement will improve soon .",

    "the present theory error of the susy prediction has been estimated to @xmath10 @xcite , almost twice as large as the future experimental uncertainty .    in this work we present results of a new calculation of an important class of susy two - loop contributions to @xmath7 : contributions where a fermion / sfermion loop is inserted into a susy one - loop diagram .",

    "the computation of these diagrams is technically more demanding than the ones of the previously known two - loop contributions to @xmath7 .",
    "however , these two - loop fermion / sfermion - loop contributions are phenomenologically interesting particularly for split spectra because they are non - decoupling but logarithmically enhanced by heavy squarks .",
    "they further eliminate a significant source of theory uncertainty present in the one - loop contributions .    in the following we begin with an overview of the known contributions , stressing the variety of possibilities for large susy contributions to @xmath7 .",
    "we define benchmark points representing these possibilities .",
    "we then explain the new contributions from fermion / sfermion loops and their numerical behaviour .",
    "finally we give a comparison of the new and the previously known contributions .",
    "before describing the new contributions in more detail we give a brief account of the theory status of the susy prediction for @xmath7 . the one - loop contributions in arise from feynman diagrams with the exchange of the susy partners of the muon or neutrino , smuon @xmath11 or sneutrino @xmath12 , and the susy partners of the neutral or charged sm bosons , the neutralinos or charginos @xmath13 .",

    "this clearly shows that susy can be the origin of the deviation ( [ deviation ] ) .",
    "however , in the general case , already the one - loop contributions have an intricate parameter dependence , as shown on an analytic level in .",
    "we illustrate this variety of possibilities at the one - loop level by and define representative benchmark parameter points in tab .",

    "the benchmark point bm4 represents this large @xmath29-region . the possibility for such contributions with negative @xmath16 and their compatibility with dark matter constraints",

    "second , our later two - loop results will hold in larger regions of parameter space represented by the benchmark points .",
    "the susy two - loop contributions can be grouped into two classes @xcite : in class 2l(a ) a pure susy loop ( of either charginos , neutralinos , or sfermions ) is inserted into a sm - like diagram ; these contributions have been evaluated exactly in refs .",
    "they can be large in certain regions of parameter space , but they become small as the masses of susy particles and/or heavy higgs bosons become large .",
    "diagrams of class 2l(b ) involve a loop correction to a susy one - loop diagram .",
    "their results are not completely known , but leading qed - logarithms @xcite , the full qed - corrections @xcite , and @xmath34-enhanced corrections @xcite have been computed .",
    "further computations of selected diagrams of classes 2l(a ) and 2l(b ) have been carried out in refs .",
    "all known contributions of class 2l(b ) can be significant corrections to the susy one - loop contributions .",
    "we close the section by listing our standard values for the additional parameters that become relevant at the two - loop level , the additional squark and slepton mass parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 and the cp - odd higgs - boson mass @xmath37 . where not stated otherwise , we set , like ref.@xcite , @xmath38",
    "the two - loop fermion / sfermion - loop contributions of fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams ] considered in the present letter belong to the class 2l(b ) .",
    "their computation represents a big step towards the full two - loop computation of @xmath7 in the mssm .",

    "the fermion / sfermion pairs in the inner loop run over all quarks and leptons of all three generations and the associated squarks and sleptons .",
    "hence these contributions introduce a dependence of @xmath7 on all sfermion mass parameters for the squark and slepton doublets and singlets of all generations . with the assumption of universality of the first two generations stated above , and since the smuon mass parameters @xmath39 and",

    "technically , the two - loop fermion / sfermion - loop diagrams involve a higher number of heavy mass scales than all previously considered two - loop contributions to @xmath7 in the sm and the mssm .",
    "the sm diagrams involve up to three , the diagrams of refs.@xcite up to four , the diagrams here up to five different heavy mass scales .",
    "we have computed the diagrams in two ways  once by appropriately extending the standard techniques developed for refs.@xcite , and once using an iterated one - loop calculation similar to the simpler cases of ref .",
    "@xcite . a similar class of diagrams with neutralino or gluino exchange has been considered for electric dipole moments in refs .",
    "@xcite in an approximation where higgsino  gaugino mixing is neglected . in refs.@xcite",
    "all two - loop diagrams were ultraviolet finite , while in our case the diagrams involve subdivergences and need to be renormalized .",
    "in addition to the genuine two - loop diagrams we consider the counterterm diagrams of fig .   [",
    "fig : ctdiagrams ] .",
    "we use the on - shell renormalization scheme for sm and susy masses as in refs.@xcite and the @xmath49-scheme for @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the renormalization constants are computed from diagrams with either mixed fermion / sfermion - loops or pure fermion- or sfermion - loops .",
    "adding two - loop and counterterm diagrams yields the final finite and well - defined result for the fermion / sfermion - loop contributions @xmath50 .",
    "the full details of the calculation and analytical results will be presented in a forthcoming publication . in the following",
    "we will present and discuss the main properties of the results for @xmath50 .",
    "their two most prominent features are :    * they contain the large and universal quantities @xmath1 and @xmath2 from fermion and sfermion loops , see sec .",
    "[ sec : universalcorrections ] .",
    "* they show non - decoupling behaviour if e.g.  squark masses become large , and they contain large logarithms of ratios of squark masses over smuon , chargino and neutralino masses , see sec .",
    "[ sec : logs ] .",
    "this allows to find rather simple semianalytic approximations for these contributions .      to discuss the first point we start by noting that all susy one - loop contributions are proportional to the fine - structure constant @xmath51 and some power of the weak mixing angle @xmath52 or @xmath53",
    "there are several motivated definitions of these quantities , e.g.  @xmath54 can be defined at zero momentum in the thomson limit , or as a running @xmath55 at the z - boson mass scale , or @xmath56 could be eliminated in favour of the muon decay constant @xmath57 . here ,",
    "@xmath58 , and the shift @xmath59 is defined via fermion - loop contributions to the photon vacuum polarization , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent evaluation .",
    "using @xmath57 effectively amounts to using @xmath60 , where @xmath61 summarizes quantum corrections to muon decay .",
    "the leading contributions to @xmath61 are given by @xmath59 and the fermion- and sfermion - loop contributions to the quantity @xmath2 , see ref.@xcite for definitions and a precise mssm evaluation .",
    "inserted into @xmath28 , the differences are numerically sizeable , and this ambiguity is an inherent source of theory uncertainty of the one - loop calculation",
    ". however , the differences are formally of two - loop order , and in a full two - loop calculation the differences will be compensated by corresponding differences in the definitions of the renormalization constant @xmath62 .",
    "the point is that the differences arise mainly from @xmath59 and @xmath2  and thus from fermion and sfermion loops .",
    "so it is precisely our new class of two - loop contributions to @xmath7 which eliminates the one - loop parametrization ambiguity .",
    "the full two - loop result is insensitive to the choice of parametrization , up to subleading contributions to @xmath61 and three - loop effects . in our calculation",
    "we choose to parametrize the one - loop result in terms of @xmath55 , which leads to the simplest structure of the renormalization constants and the smallest values of the two - loop contributions .    tab .",
    "[ tab : deltarhoresults ] shows the numerical impact of the one - loop parametrization ambiguity compared to our full two - loop result , for the cases of the benchmark points .",
    "the first rows show the three different one - loop results obtained from the three indicated definitions of @xmath54 ; the last row shows the sum of the one - loop result and our new two - loop contributions , consistently parametrized in terms of @xmath55 .",
    "the size of the intervals spanned by the different one - loop results is @xmath63 .",
    "the two - loop contributions are between @xmath64 and @xmath65 of the respective one - loop contributions .",
    "it is not surprising that the two - loop contributions are similarly large as the size of these one - loop intervals ; but it is noteworthy that in all cases the full two - loop result is significantly _ outside _ the one - loop intervals .",
    "this highlights the importance of the fermion / sfermion - loop contributions , beyond merely reducing the theory uncertainty .",
    "= 0.8      next we focus on the parameter dependence of the new two - loop contributions . as discussed above , in our analysis",
    "there are eight free mass parameters for the inner loops , in addition to the parameters already present at the one - loop level .    motivated by the lhc results discussed in the introduction , we allow split spectra and vary all the eight mass parameters separately over the wide range from 1  1000  tev .",
    "fig.[fig : bm1plot ] shows the resulting two - loop corrections for the case of benchmark point bm1 , where one mass parameter is varied at a time and the others are fixed at their standard values .",
    "the non - decoupling , logarithmic dependence on all the sfermion masses is apparent . for this benchmark point and the chosen sfermion mass range",
    ", the two - loop corrections can have both signs and can be as large as 10% or @xmath66% of the one - loop contributions .",
    "more generally , the results for sufficiently heavy sfermions can be well approximated by leading logarithms .",
    "we obtain the semianalytical expression @xmath67 where the sums extend over the squarks and the sleptons , respectively .",
    "the coefficients @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 implicitly depend on the one - loop parameters in a complicated way , but the dependence on the eight two - loop parameters is made explicit .",
    "we have verified that this approximation is valid for all benchmark points provided the sfermion masses are above around 5 tev . instead of repeating fig .",
    "[ fig : bm1plot ] for all benchmark points we provide with all necessary coefficients .",
    "the physical reason for the non - decoupling behaviour is that the effective theory obtained by integrating out a heavy sfermion is not supersymmetric any more .",
    "gaugino and higgsino interactions can differ from the corresponding gauge and yukawa interactions by matching constants which contain large logarithms of the heavy sfermion mass . for gaugino interactions these non - decoupling matching corrections",
    "are known as superoblique corrections , and refs .",
    "@xcite have given analytical results for the coefficients of the large logarithms for several cases .",
    "the results are proportional to the square of the gauge couplings of the heavy sfermion .",
    "likewise , the matching corrections to the higgsino interactions ( analytical results for heavy squarks can be found in ref.@xcite ) contain large logarithms times the square of the sfermion yukawa coupling .",
    "this knowledge allows a qualitative understanding of the results of fig .",
    "[ fig : bm1plot ] and tab.[tab : coefficients ] .",
    "the top and bottom yukawa couplings are the largest couplings of the inner loop , followed by the tau yukawa and the su(2 ) and u(1 ) gauge couplings .",
    "the first / second generation yukawa couplings are negligible . in bm1 , the higgsino",
    " wino contribution dominates at the one - loop level .",
    "hence , the slopes of the @xmath46 , @xmath44 lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : bm1plot ] are largest because of the large top yukawa coupling to the higgsino .",
    "the slope of the @xmath43 line is also large since the left - handed squarks couple to the wino .",
    "the slopes of the @xmath71 , @xmath72 lines are particularly small since the 1st/2nd generation singlets have neither significant yukawa couplings nor su(2 ) gauge interactions .",

    "wino contribution becomes less , the pure bino contribution more important .",
    "clearly , the non - decoupling logarithms to the bino contributions are controlled by the small u(1 ) gauge couplings and the hypercharges .",
    "we have verified that for a parameter point where the bino contribution dominates sufficiently strongly , the coefficients of the logarithms indeed become generation - independent and proportional to the squared hypercharge of the respective sfermion .",
    "for our point bm3 , only the coefficients @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 have this behaviour .",
    "the other coefficients also receive non - negligible corrections from the higgsino  wino contributions , which are about 7 times smaller than the bino contribution but involve much larger corrections similar to the case of bm1 .",
    "nevertheless , this explains the overall decrease of the slopes for bm2 and bm3 .",
    "the case of bm4 is similar to the one of bm1 , except that at the one - loop level the higgsino ",
    "bino contribution dominates , instead of the higgsino  wino contribution .",
    "the relative corrections from top - yukawa enhanced contributions are larger for bm4 , and therefore the slopes for @xmath76 are even larger for bm4 than for bm1 .    the validity of the approximation ( [ llapproximation ] ) and the coefficients in tab .",
