    "advanced driver assistance systems ( adas ) aim to support drivers or take over the driving tasks to operate vehicles in a safe , comfortable and efficient way @xcite .",

    "considerable efforts have been dedicated to adas control design and investigation of the resulting traffic flow properties . among them , adaptive cruise control ( acc ) systems attract most of the attention due to the early availability in the market .",
    "the most widely reported acc model is a proportional derivative ( pd ) controller , where the vehicle acceleration is proportional to the gap ( net distance headway ) and relative speed with respect to the preceding vehicle ( derivative of gap ) at car - following conditions .",
    "this controller has been well examined @xcite , and is essentially a helly car - following model @xcite .",
    "extensions of this controller class have been reported to include acceleration of the predecessor @xcite or multi - anticipative behaviour @xcite in the controller .",
    "however , there is no safety mechanism in this model . under critical conditions",
    ", acc systems have to be overruled by drivers and hard braking has to be performed to avoid collision @xcite . some researchers @xcite used the optimal velocity model ( ovm ) to describe the controlled vehicle behaviour and proposed a cooperative driving system under which the desired speed is determined not only by the gap to the vehicle in front but also by the gap to the vehicle behind .",
    "unfortunately , the optimal velocity model is not collision free under realistic parameters @xcite .",
    "the intelligent driver model ( idm ) is used to design acc controllers with a driving strategy that varies parameters according to traffic situations to mitigate congestion at bottlenecks @xcite .",
    "other controllers are reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the resulting traffic flow characteristics of adas differ among the controller and parameter settings .",
    "the increase of capacity is mainly a result of shorter time headways compared to human drivers @xcite , while choosing a larger time headway could cause negative impacts on capacity @xcite . regarding the stability ,",
    "some authors provide evidence that acc / cacc systems improve flow stability @xcite , while others @xcite are more conservative on the stabilisation effects of acc systems .",
    "adas and cooperative systems have a direct influence on the vehicular behaviour and consequently on flow operations .",
    "the lack of clarity on aggregated impacts of adas in literature calls for new insights into the model properties of adas and cooperative systems .",
    "furthermore , the increasing public concerns on traffic congestion and environment stimulate the need for development of driver assistance systems that can fulfil multiple objectives , cooperate with each other and operate vehicles in an optimal way .",
    "it is however difficult to use the existing phenomenological adas controllers to achieve all these objectives .",
    "this contribution generalises previous work on driver behaviour @xcite to a control framework for driver assistance and cooperative systems .",
    "the framework is generic in such a way that different control objectives , i.e. safety , comfort , efficiency and sustainability , can be optimised .",
    "it is assumed that accelerations of adas vehicles are controlled to optimise a cost function reflecting multiple control objectives . under the framework",
    ", we propose a complete acc controller , which produces plausible human car - following behaviour at both microscopic and macroscopic level",
    ". the controller can be applied to all traffic situations , i.e. not only car - following and free driving conditions , but also safety - critical conditions such as approaching standstill vehicles with high speeds .",
    "the flexibility in the system and cost specification allows modelling a cooperative acc ( c - acc ) controller , where an equipped vehicle exhibits cooperative behaviour by optimising the joint cost of both itself and its follower .",
    "the aggregated flow characteristics of the acc / c - acc models are investigated analytically , with a focus on equilibrium solutions and ( linear ) stability analysis . analytical criteria to quantify the influence on the model stability due to cooperative behaviour are derived .",

    "section 2 presents the modelling framework and solution approach , with several examples showing the application of the framework .",
    "section 3 gives the analytical solutions at equilibrium conditions , criteria for string stability and the method for classification of string instability types .",
    "section 4 gives insights into the model characteristics of the example controllers .",
    "conclusions and future work are discussed in section 5 .",
    "in this section , we first present the underlying assumptions and mathematical formulation of the control framework .",
    "the optimal control problem is solved using the dynamic programming approach , and the framework is applied to design acc and cooperative acc controllers .",
    "the controller framework is based on the following assumptions :    1 .",
    "a controlled vehicle adapts its speed or changes lanes to minimise a certain cost function , reflecting the control objectives . 2 .",
    "a controlled vehicle has all information regarding ( relative ) positions and speeds of other vehicles influencing its control decisions .",
    "other vehicles influencing the control decisions are driving at stationary conditions within the prediction horizon , i.e. accelerations equal zero .",
    "4 .   control decisions are updated at regular time intervals .",
    "longitudinal manoeuvres of adas equipped vehicles are under automated control .    for the sake of analytical tractability , we only consider deterministic cases without time delay in this contribution , i.e. there is no noise in the information regarding other vehicles and the control decisions can be executed immediately .",
    "the control framework is generic in that it allows one to include stochastic processes and time lags in the controller @xcite .",
    "control decisions are made to fulfil some control objectives , which can be a subset of the following :    1 .   to maximise travel efficiency ; 2 .   to minimise lane - changing manoeuvres ; 3 .",
    "to minimise risk ; 4 .   to minimise fuel consumption and emissions ; 5",
    ".   to maximise smoothness and comfort",
    ".    the importance of each of these objectives can vary according to design preferences , traffic conditions , or individual vehicles , e.g. some systems may give priority to safe driving , while others prefer travel efficiency , accepting smaller headways and higher risk if other influencing factors ( speed and relative speed ) are kept constant .",
    "the proposed framework formulates the movements of adas equipped vehicles as a receding horizon control ( also referred to as model predictive control ) process , which entails solving an optimal control problem subject to system dynamics and other constraints on system state and control input @xcite .",
    "1 shows the schematic graph of the receding horizon control process . at time",
    "instant @xmath0 , the controller of equipped vehicle @xmath1 receives the positions and speeds of other vehicles from ( erroneous ) observations either made by its on - board sensors or transmitted from other sensors through v2v and/or v2i communication .",
    "based on this information and past state , the controller estimates the current state of the system @xmath2 , and uses a ( system dynamics ) model to predict the future state of the system in a time horizon @xmath3 , with the estimate of the system state at @xmath0 as the initial condition .",
    "the control input @xmath4 , i.e. acceleration or lane choice , is determined to minimise the cost @xmath5 accumulated in the prediction horizon reflecting , for instance , deviation of the future state from the desired state .",
    "the on - board actuators will execute the control input @xmath4 at time @xmath0 . as the vehicle manoeuvres ,",

    "solving this type of problem entails choosing a terminal cost @xmath37 to ensure expected controller behaviour and computational feasibility , which is not trivial @xcite .",
    "an alternative is to set @xmath38 and @xmath39 , thus the weight for the terminal cost @xmath40 equals zero .",

    "clearly , the inclusion of marginal cost of the follower s speed in the optimal control law captures the _ cooperative nature _ of the c - acc controller .",
    "we emphasise that the control input @xmath4 is not limited to the control of a single vehicle .",
