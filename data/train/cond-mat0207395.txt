    "the broadening of the transition is probably due to sample inhomogeneities .    as mentioned in introduction , we have recently confirmed this @xmath4 enhancement with sr chemical pressure in the hg-2212 system in a second series , doped with 20  % of ca on the y site , i.e. with a higher doping level . in this second series , @xmath4 increases from 21  k ( y  =  0 ) to 58 - 60  k ( y  =  0.7 - 1.0 )  @xcite .",

    "however , for n  =  1 , it has been demonstrated ( see ref . in  @xcite ) by fluorination that cu - o2 distance reduction does not cause an enhancement of t@xmath75 , it is more likely the compression of the in - plane cu - o1 distance that is responsible of the t@xmath75 enhancement .",
    "this goes in the same way than that observed for strained films . in plane",
    "compressive strain in epitaxial la@xmath86sr@xmath87cuo@xmath22 thin films induces a doubling of t@xmath75 from 25  k to 49  k while a - axis ( then cu - o1 distance ) decreases from 3.784   ( bulk ) to 3.76    @xcite , giving dt@xmath75/da @xmath88 1000  k.@xmath89 . in our sr - substituted hg-2212 samples ,",

    "in contrast , the hg / y - o2 distance shows smaller relative variation , less than 1  % .",

    "figure  11 , and  12 , compare the variations of the cr and sb thicknesses and , hg - hg and cu - cu distances , for chemical pressure ( npd data ) and mechanical pressure ( synchrotron data ) .",
    "they are similar , except one feature : the cu - cu distance which quantifies the sb thickness .",
    "it increases by 3  % with sr substitution , but decreases by  2  % by applying mechanical pressure .",
    "the same effect is observed in the monolayer ( hg , re)-1223 family : the complete substitution of sr increases the sb thickness by 3  %  @xcite . the same trend is also observed in the cu@xmath0(ba@xmath41sr@xmath42ycu@xmath0o@xmath72  @xcite and cu(ba@xmath41sr@xmath42ycu@xmath0o@xmath43  @xcite compounds .",
    "this increase is then intrinsic to the sr presence , it can not be related to @xmath4 which increases with sr substitution in hg-2212 while it decreases in the latter ones .",
    "at the same time , the interplanar ba - sb - ba thickness decreases drastically by 3 - 4  % .",
    "then , the bao2 and cuo1 planes move towards each others , which leads to the great decrease of the apical cu - o2 distance to 2.27   .",
    "the variation of the hg - hg distance ( -2.3  % ) follows the variation of the ba - cr - ba thickness which decreases by about 2  % .",
    "the structural effect of chemical pressure in hg@xmath0(ba@xmath1sr@xmath23ycu@xmath0o@xmath3 was studied by neutron powder diffraction and correlated to the superconducting properties .",
    "the sr substitution in hg-2212 has a positive effect on @xmath4 contrarily to the majority of cuprates .",
    "it increases gradually @xmath4 from 0  k ( y  =  0.0 ) to 42  k  ( y  =  1.0 ) .",
    "moreover the sr substituted compounds are already superconducting without ca - doping on the y site .",
    "no coherent correlation can be made between the continuous @xmath4 increase and the variation of the formal valence of cu in the sr substituted series .    from a structural point of view , the chemical pressure introduced by sr is similar to the mechanical pressure , except for the sb thickness which increases with sr substitution while it decreases under external pressure .",
    "however , this is not correlated with the variation of @xmath4 , as proved by the comparison with hg-1223 , cu-1212 or cu-2212 systems .",
    "the detailed analysis of the atomic positions shows that the shrinkage of the `` ( ba / sr)o@xmath81 '' coordination polyhedra with the sr content , i.e. the strong decrease of the ba / sr - o(1)(2)(3 ) bonds . as a consequence ,",
    "cu - o1 and ba / sr - o2 planes become closer , but no effect on the y - o1 bonds ( i.e. between the cuo@xmath0 superconducting planes ) is observed .",
    "the sr chemical pressure has a pronounced effect on the hg / y - o3 bond which increases , making the hg / y - o flat , while it decreases strongly the cu - o1@xmath5 and cu - o2@xmath6 bonds .",
    "these structural changes , and particulary the two last ones , should affect greatly the charge repartition in the 2212 lattice and then the charge transfer towards the superconducting planes , explaining the observed @xmath4 increase with the sr content .",
