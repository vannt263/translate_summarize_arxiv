    "product codes were introduced by elias @xcite and subsequently generalized by forney @xcite to concatenated codes .",
    "product codes are a method of constructing larger codes from smaller codes while retaining the good rates and good decoding complexity from the smaller codes .",
    "the codewords of a product code can be written as matrices with the rows belonging to the row component code and the columns belonging to the column component code .",
    "list decoding algorithms have also been studied in this context in barg and zmor @xcite where the min - sum algorithm was shown to be amenable to list decoding of product codes .",
    "product codes have been subsequently generalized to yield codes obtained from product of nonlinear codes by amrani @xcite , and to multilevel product codes by zinoviev @xcite .",
    "amrani @xcite gave the construction of product codes from component nonlinear codes which are binary and systematic .",
    "the construction guarantees that all the columns of any codeword belong to the column component code ; however only the first few rows corresponding to the systematic part of the column code are guaranteed to belong to the row code . in the case where one of the component codes is linear , amrani @xcite proposed two soft - decision decoding algorithms . irregular product codes , introduced by alipour _",
    "et al._@xcite , are yet another generalization of product codes where each row and column code can be a code of different rate .",
    "irregular product codes were introduced to address the need for unequal error protection from bursty noise when some parts of the codeword are more vulnerable to burst errors than others .    in this work",
    "we study constructions of systematic nonlinear product codes which are obtained as products of affine codes  cosets of linear codes .",
    "in contrast to the work of amrani @xcite , our construction guarantees that all the rows belong to the ( affine ) row code and all the columns belong to the ( affine ) column code .",
    "one primary motivation for studying such class of codes arises from a previous study on coded modulation for power line channels by chee _",
    "et al._@xcite that proposed a generalization of the coded modulation scheme of vinck @xcite .",
    "et al._@xcite showed that binary matrix codes with bounded column weights , in conjunction with multitone frequency shift keying , can be used to counter the harsh noise characteristics of the power line channel .",
    "concatenated codes obtained from the concatenation of constant weight inner codes with reed - solomon outer codes were used to obtain families of efficiently decodable codes with good rates and good relative distances . in this work",
    ", we continue this line of investigation and introduce _ binary _ systematic product codes with the additional restriction that the row and column weights are bounded .",
    "the restriction on the column weight arises from the desire to be able to detect and correct impulse noise that is present in the power line channel .",
    "the restriction on the row weights allows one to detect and correct narrowband noise .",
    "it is quite evident that product codes obtained from the product of linear codes do not satisfy these restrictions .",
    "the nonlinear codes studied in this paper are constructed to satisfy these properties .",
    "the efficient decoding algorithms of product codes are directly applicable to the constructions presented in this work . as a first step to the decoding process",
    ", we subtract the coset representative that is used in the construction .",
    "the coset representative is explicitly described , as explained in the following sections .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce the basic definitions and notation that are used throughout the rest of this paper .",

    "the product code in general does not have this restriction .",
    "this satisfies point ( a4 ) in the criteria that we want to satisfy .",
    "therefore , it is of interest ( and an open problem ) to obtain the true upper bound for codes which are optimal and which satisfy all the four criteria ( a1)(a4 ) .",
    "the power line channel is known to be frequency selective ( see @xcite ) , i.e. , the background noise in different frequency slots are of different intensities . thus , it is of interest to provide constructions of codes that can provide different levels of error correction over different frequencies .",
    "such codes can be constructed as product codes where the rows of the matrix correspond to different row codes .",
    "such codes have been studied earlier as `` generalized concatenated codes '' or `` multilevel concatenated codes '' ( see blokh and zyablov @xcite , zinoviev @xcite , and dumer @xcite ) .",
    "the row codes , which correspond to the row encoding , in these constructions are defined over an extension field of the field of the column code . as a result , although the resulting matrix code is linear over the smaller field , the rows do not in general belong to the row code .",
    "this makes it difficult to extend the construction to product of affine codes .",
    "instead , we consider the case where the component codes for each row and column are different .",
    "although the application is only for binary component codes , we provide the general theory for @xmath0-ary component codes .",
