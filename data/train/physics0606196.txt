    "large eddy simulation ( les ) @xcite is one of the typical numerical approaches to turbulent flows , in which large - scale structures in fluid motion are solved directly while the effects of the small - scale eddies are modeled based on a filtering operation that separates the high- and low - wavenumber modes in turbulent flow fields .",
    "because les enables us to treat time - dependent , high - reynolds - number turbulence with substantially smaller computational effort and storage than direct numerical simulation ( dns ) resolving all scales of motion , it has been used in many applications in a variety of research fields , including fluid machinery @xcite , combustion engineering @xcite , atmospheric science @xcite , geophysics @xcite , and astrophysics @xcite .    for the past few years",
    ", however , several reports have been published that point out the incompleteness of current les modeling . in those repots",
    "it has been implied that even a completely accurate les model could be numerically unstable . in ref .",
    "@xcite , leonard showed that the tensor - diffusivity model , re - derived by truncating an exact expansion series of subfilter - scale forces @xcite , works as a negative - diffusion term in the stretching directions of fluid motion and hence , that it could lead to numerical instability when used for finite difference schemes .",
    "since that model is exact for first - order velocity fields where the velocity components can be described by linear polynomials , the model s negative diffusivity can be considered to exhibit the nature of the _ exact _ model under a particular condition .",
    "also , winckelmans et al .",
    "@xcite and kobayashi and shimomura @xcite pointed out that the tensor - diffusivity model behaves unstably in a plane channel flow , also due to the model s negative diffusivity . in a comparative study of les models ( the tensor - diffusivity and rational les models ) @xcite ,",
    "iliescu et al . showed that the tensor - diffusivity model can be unstable in a high - reynolds - number driven cavity flow , as well . in ref .",
    "@xcite , ida and taniguchi derived a closed form of the gaussian - filtered navier - stokes ( gfns ) equations under a simple assumption about the instantaneous velocity profile and showed theoretically that the shears in time - averaged flow fields can also be the seed of the numerical instability of the filtered system , because a cross derivative of the filtered velocity component , being unconditionally unstable in numerical simulation , appears in the closed formula .",
    "the authors stressed that the unstable portions in the closed formula must be solved accurately without using artificial techniques ( e.g. , clipping or damping ) , since those portions derive naturally from the filtering operation and are thus a part of the governing equations for les . in the sequel to that paper @xcite , ida and",
    "taniguchi further ascertained that the shears in the time - averaged fields can , through the filtering operation , cause the appearance of a numerically unstable term that always exhibits a negative diffusivity in a fixed direction , a conclusion that is able to explain the problematic instability that has frequently been confronted in wall - bounded turbulent flow computations ( e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , where a strong shear appears in the time - averaged streamwise velocity .",
    "the theoretical and numerical findings listed above appear to suggest that the filtering operation itself is the underlying cause of the numerical instability in les , raising the question whether a numerically stable les model can be ideally accurate or not .",
    "a similar scenario can be found in simulation strategies for collisionless plasma kinetics that use the vlasov - poisson or vlasov - maxwell system as a governing equation . in refs .",
    "@xcite , klimas has attempted to apply a gaussian filter to the vlasov equations in order to mollify the filamentation of the distribution function ( an infinitely fine structure in the phase space ) , and found that the filtered vlasov equations can be rewritten into a closed form in terms of the filtered distribution function and are thus solvable without any empirical modeling .",
    "( we note here that in klimas s study the filtering operation was only applied in the velocity space , which allows for relatively easy derivation of closed formulas and results in only a few additional terms . ) in that closed formula , a cross derivative of the filtered distribution function appears , which , as figua et al . suggested @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) , makes the filtered system ill - conditioned and unsuitable for numerical simulations using finite difference methods or others excluding the spectral method . as with the navier - stokes cases mentioned above , that finding implies that the gaussian filtering operation itself , and not the modeling or approximations , destabilizes the governing equations .",
    "the present paper extends the numerical stability analysis of the gfns equations performed by ida and taniguchi @xcite to construct a generalized theory for the numerical instability of the system .",
    "the present discussion assumes that the flow fields are , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , in a statistically steady state ( an assumption allowing us to decompose the velocity components into time - independent mean and time - dependent fluctuation portions ) , but the mean velocities may be described by high - order polynomials in terms of the spatial coordinates , while in ref .  @xcite",
    "first - order velocity fields have mainly been considered . under these assumptions and using the exact expansion series or integration by parts , we rewrite the terms that represent the interaction between the mean and fluctuation portions ( referred to below as `` mean - fluctuation terms '' ) , filtered by a gaussian function , into closed forms involving high - order cross derivatives , and show that through gaussian filtering , various kinds of unconditionally unstable terms having time - independent coefficients are derived which numerically destabilize the modes in a fixed range of directions . also , detailed stability analyses of the resulting closed formulas are presented to derive a stability criterion for the choice of filter widths . in the present paper , for simplicity",
    "we only discuss cases in which the mean velocity field has one - dimensional ( 1d ) or two - dimensional ( 2d ) structures .",
    "moreover , we are not concerned with the commutation error between differentiation and filtering ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite for recent efforts to resolve the commutation error ) , assuming each filter width to be constant in the corresponding spatial direction .",
    "this treatment warrants that the numerically unstable terms that we discuss are not those originating from the commutation error , which is a modeling failure .    the present theoretical investigation has been performed assuming the use of finite difference schemes",
    ". however , most of the results will be true for other numerical methods ( e.g. , finite volume , finite element , compact differencing ) as well .",
    "also , in order to accomplish the theoretical investigation without the aid of numerical analysis , the present study neglects the cutoff of high - wavenumber modes originating from the use of finite grid spacing .",
    "the gaussian filter considered in the present study is , therefore , assumed to approximately represent the numerical damping of high - wavenumber modes due to numerical viscosity ( also originating from the use of finite grid spacing ) , and also to be an explicit filter applied independently of numerical discretization @xcite .",

    "@xcite , leonard considered the pure advection of a sinusoidal wave in a stretching velocity field where the amplitude of the ( unfiltered ) sinusoidal wave remains constant , and provided an interpretation of the negative diffusivity of the tensor - diffusivity model as follows : as a sinusoidal wave propagates into a stretching velocity field , its wavenumber gradually decreases , resulting in the increase of the gaussian - filtered value of the amplitude because of the larger value of the gaussian filter function for a lower wavenumber .",
    "the negative - diffusion term represents this amplification of the filtered value resulting from the wavenumber shift .",
    "we introduce here a different interpretation of the negative diffusivity , using fig .",
    "let us consider the 1d pure advection of a step function , @xmath221 in a stretching velocity field @xmath222 , where @xmath223 ( @xmath224 is the initial position of the discontinuity in the step function and @xmath225 is a positive constant .",

    "this solution smoothes out the discontinuity to yield a mollified step whose characteristic width is about @xmath228 , where @xmath229 is the characteristic length of the applied gaussian filter .",
    "obviously the characteristic width of the mollified step is time - independent if @xmath230 is constant .",
    "if , however , the pure advection equation in terms of the filtered value , @xmath231 , is used to advance the filtered profile ( corresponding to the case where the residual stress term is clipped ) , the width of the mollified step , unlike that in the true solution , increases gradually as time goes by due to the stretching velocity field where a downstream fluid particle moves faster than an upstream particle . to counteract this artificial expansion of the mollified step ,",
    "a modification by negative , not positive , diffusion is necessary , which sharpens @xmath41 . in the case of a compression velocity field , a similar but opposite treatment , i.e. , the addition of a positive diffusion term ,",
    "is needed because an artificial compression of the mollified step arises if only the pure advection equation is assumed .",
    "the present physical picture may allow us to conclude that the subfilter - scale terms should have an analogous negative diffusivity also for any other filter functions that smooth the profile of dependent variables . in the above discussion",
    ", there is no reason that the filter shape must be gaussian .",
    "the artificial expansion of the step discussed above must occur whenever the step is smoothed out by a smooth filter but the pure advection equation is solved .",
    "the above discussion also suggests that a numerically unstable term can appear by filtering even if the true solution ( both filtered and unfiltered ) is physically bounded .",
    "the present theory has several limitations in its applicability resulting from the assumptions and simplifications made . in this section",
    "we remark on some significant issues that must be resolved for further generalization .    to construct a more general theory for the numerical stability of the gfns equations in statistically steady states , one has to elucidate the numerical stability of , not only eq .

    "equation ( [ eq99 ] ) represents a complicated coupling between the equations of different velocity components . in the present study ,",
    "having assumed 1d or 2d mean velocity fields , some of the mean - fluctuation terms were uncoupled as eqs .",
    "( [ eq31 ] ) , ( [ eq32 ] ) , ( [ eq61 ] ) , and ( [ eq76 ] ) , and hence the determined stability conditions are accurate only for the corresponding uncoupled portions . in fully 3d cases where high - order velocity fields must be assumed , however , we may well have to treat the fully coupled system ( [ eq99 ] ) .",
    "the strongest assumption among those made in this paper may be the omission of the nonlinear fluctuation term @xmath236 $ ] in eq .",
    "( [ eq11 ] ) .",
    "we could not take into consideration the effects of this term since the theoretical investigation of it is quite difficult to perform accurately , and the present theory is thus only valid when the fluctuation is small .",
    "terms of this type , as is well known , have a dissipative character in many turbulent flows , and hence when the dissipation of the omitted term is strong enough , the instability of the mean - fluctuation terms can be eliminated completely .",
    "one possible way to gain detailed knowledge of the nonlinear term is an _ a priori _ test using dns , which enables us to determine the values of all terms in the gfns equations . observing and examining the numerically determined terms should allow us to obtain a more accurate prediction of the numerical instability .",
    "when , for example , the absolute value of the nonlinear term ( plus the molecular viscosity ) is smaller than that of the sum of the unstable terms , the instability can not be eliminated irrespective of the specific characteristic of the nonlinear term . also , comparing the amounts of the energy dissipations due to the unstable terms and the nonlinear terms should provide a useful insight .",
    "this issue will be addressed in a future paper .",
    "lastly , we make a brief comment on cases with a nonuniform filter width .",
    "consider again pure advection of a step function being smoothed by a smooth filter .",
    "when the filter width is spatially nonuniform , in the advection process the width of the mollified step varies according to its position even for a constant velocity , and hence a negative diffusion must take place at least in the period where the width decreases .",
    "such an effect of nonuniform filtering must be discussed carefully in the near future .",
    "we have presented a generalized theory for the numerical instability of the gaussian - filtered navier - stokes equations .",
    "the theory allows for high - order mean velocity fields and high - order derivatives resulting from the gaussian filtering operation . also , we have described stability conditions regarding the choice of the filter widths in several situations , the violation of which should lead to unconditional numerical instability of the filtered system even when a completely accurate subfilter - scale model exists and is used . it is worth noting again that the closed formulas of the filtered mean - fluctuation terms determined under statistically steady - state conditions involve various kinds of unstable derivatives that , because their coefficients are time - independent , always exhibit numerical instability in a fixed range of directions . as has been proven by a simple example",
    ", the essential part of the present results can be true even if a non - gaussian smooth filter is assumed .",
    "we stress that if one skirts this numerical instability problem , the accuracy of the les results will plateau .",
    "it is hard to imagine that ideally accurate solutions can be achieved by incorporating an artificial damping or clipping technique to avoid this numerical difficulty , because when the subfilter - scale terms act unstably , the absolute values of their unstable portions must be greater than that of the molecular and turbulent viscosities , and the adoption of such artificial techniques thus corresponds to the disregard of a term whose dominance is greater than that of a term involved _ ab initio _ in the navier - stokes equations .",
    "recently , moeleker and leonard @xcite have tackled this numerical instability problem and proposed an approach to potentially resolve it , based on an anisotropic particle method incorporating a remeshing technique .",
    "their method has provided excellent results for a 2d scalar advection - diffusion equation with a known velocity field .",
    "however , the extension of that approach to the 3d navier - stokes equations has to the author s knowledge not yet been achieved . because finite difference schemes have been used widely in turbulence computations , constructing a stable and accurate solver in the finite difference framework would be preferable , though it will be an exceedingly difficult task and might even be an unsolvable problem , such as the gravitational three - body problem and the algebraic solution of general fifth - order polynomial equations of one variable .",
