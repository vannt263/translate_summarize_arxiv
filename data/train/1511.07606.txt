    "the study of thermal phenomena at the nanoscale has received great attention in the recent years due to the remarkable properties that differ significantly from their bulk counterparts @xcite . when the microstructural length scales of a material become comparable to the mean free path of the phonon",
    ", surfaces start to influence the overall thermal transport @xcite .",
    "these specific thermal properties can be of great use in various applications such as thermoelectricity or more generally energy conversion devices @xcite .",
    "apart from the technological considerations , the study of thermal properties at the nanoscale presents fundamental questions related to the interaction of heat transfer and microstructure at these small length scales : effect on the mean free path @xcite , on the dispersion relations and then on the average phonon group velocities etc ... @xcite .",
    "these effects are also of great interest in amorphous materials like silicon nitride , a material having large potential device applications due to its low thermal conductivity @xcite .    accurately tailoring the thermal properties of nanoscale systems",
    "requires the fabrication of very small samples .",
    "hence , innovative techniques able to measure accurately the reduced values of the thermal properties are a growing need . the measurement of thermal transport properties in thin films has been improved significantly in recent years .",
    "the 3@xmath2 method is generally used to measure the thermal conductivity of semi - infinite materials @xcite .",
    "it has been also shown in the past that this technique based on a dynamic measurement can be used to extract the specific heat @xcite . however ,",
    "this has never been demonstrated on a membrane system .    here by coupling the 3@xmath2 method @xcite and the v@xmath3lklein geometry @xcite ( elongated suspended membrane ) , we present a system designed to measure the specific heat of silicon nitride suspended membrane ( 50  nm and 100  nm thick ) over a wide temperature range ( 8 to 300  k ) .",
    "this work is an extension of the recently proposed device to measure the thermal conductivity @xcite .",
    "the major advantage of the proposed technique comes from the concomitant measurement of the two important thermal properties of materials : the thermal conductivity ( @xmath4 ) and the specific heat ( @xmath5 ) by the measurement at different thermal excitation frequencies on the same sample ; low frequency for @xmath4 and high frequency for @xmath5 .",
    "although less sensitive , this technique offers possibilities that can not be obtained easily from classical specific heat measurement like ac calorimetry @xcite , fast scanning calorimetry @xcite or relaxation calorimetry @xcite .",
    "the principle of the method consists in creating a sinusoidal joule heating generated by an a.c .",
    "electrical current of frequency @xmath2 across a transducer centered along the long axis of a rectangular membrane .",
    "the center of the membrane is thermally isolated from the frame and hence its temperature is free to increase .",
    "the temperature oscillation of the membrane is at 2@xmath2 and is directly related to its thermal properties by its amplitude and frequency respectively . by measuring the @xmath6 voltage appearing across the transducer , it is possible to deduce the thermal conductivity and the specific heat of the membrane .",
    "the transducer is made out of a material whose resistance is strongly temperature dependant .",
    "it serves as a thermometer and heater at the same time .",
    "however , the measured voltage across the transducer include the @xmath7 ohmic component which is usually larger than the @xmath6 thermal component by a factor of 10@xmath8 .    by using a specific wheatstone bridge",
    "@xcite we strongly reduce the component of the measured voltage at angular frequency 1@xmath2 .",
    "the bridge consists of the measured sample with its respective resistor @xmath9 , which is the niobium nitride ( nbn ) thermometer on the sin membrane , the reference thermometer @xmath10 deposited on the bulk region of the chip which has the same geometry and deposited in the same run as the transducer on the membrane ( see fig . [ thermometre ] ) , an adjustable resistor @xmath11 , and an equivalent nonadjustable resistor @xmath12 = 50  kohm .",
    "the two resistors @xmath11 and @xmath12 are positioned outside the cryogenic system .",
    "( see more details about the electrical set - up in the reference @xcite@xmath13 @xcite ) .",
    "since the reference thermometer is not on the membrane , its temperature remains at the bath temperature @xmath14 and therefore , its resistance does not change .",
    "the elevation of temperature due to self - heating of the reference transducer is neglected thanks to the thermal contact to the quasi - infinite reservoir of the bulk silicon .    in that geometry",
    ", the voltage at 1@xmath2 has been reduced by a factor of 10@xmath8 .",
    "thus , it is possible to measure the @xmath6 signal with a high sensitivity on the wheatstone bridge output without the 1@xmath2 component saturating the dynamic reserve of the lock - in amplifier .",
    "the two nbn thermometers ( nb@xmath15n@xmath16 ) have practically the same temperature behavior as they have been deposited simultaneously on the sin substrate .",
    "however , due to the presence of inhomogeneity in the deposition process , there is a slight difference of resistance .",
    "thus , the @xmath11 resistor is used to balance the bridge .",
    "thanks to the wheatstone bridge , the @xmath6 signal is larger than the @xmath7 signal .    the geometry of the membrane measured in this study is the following : 300@xmath17 m wide and 1.5  mm long ; the transducers that are patterned using regular clean room processes are centered along the main axis and have various widths : 5 , 20 , 30 and 40@xmath17 m .",
    "they are made of nbn thin film that are grown using a dc - pulsed magnetron sputtering from a high purity niobium target in a gas mixture of argon and nitrogen .",
    "this type of high sensitivity thermometer is described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite its temperature coefficient of resistance ( tcr ) can be tailored over a wide temperature range , from low temperature @xcite to high temperature @xcite .",
    "hence , depending on the stoichiometry , the electrical properties of the nbn can vary a lot . for the sin measurement",
    ", the thermometer has been designed for the 10  k to 320  k temperature range . typically , the resistance of the thermometer is about 100  kohm at room temperature with a tcr of 10@xmath18 k@xmath19 and 1  mohm at 70  k with a tcr of 0.1  k@xmath19 .",
    "the resistance of the thermometer on the membrane is calibrated using a standard four probe technique between 4  k and 330  k in a @xmath20he cryostat .",
    "the devices in the cryogenic vacuum are protected by a thermal copper shield maintained at the @xmath14 temperature to reduce the heat radiation and installed on a temperature regulated stage as schematized in the fig .",
    "[ thermometre ] .",
    "the stage temperature is regulated with a stability of the order of few millikelvin .",
    "the stage temperature @xmath14 may be varied from 4  k to more than 330  k.",
    "the nbn thermometer is calibrated in a four - probe configuration ( see fig . [ thermometre ] ) .",
    "the two outside contacts are used to apply an ac current while the voltage is measured by the two inside contacts .",
    "as the membrane is suspended , its temperature is free to fluctuate .",
    "the specimen is maintained in a high vacuum and the whole setup is heat shielded to the substrate temperature to minimize heat losses through gas convection and radiation .",
    "thus , in such configuration and with an ac electrical current of the form @xmath21sin(@xmath2 t ) passing through the specimen , the 1d partial differential equation of the heat flux across the membrane is given by :    @xmath22    with the initial and boundary conditions : + @xmath23 + @xmath24    with @xmath5 the specific heat , @xmath25 the density , @xmath26 the diffusivity of the sin membrane , and @xmath4 the thermal conductivity . the total dissipated power @xmath27 is used to heat both the thermometer and the part of the membrane under the thermometer , and the rest of the membrane :    m and length 1.5  mm ) including nbn transducer : ( a ) top view of the membrane .",
    "the isotherm lines lie along the transducer except at the edge of the membrane;(b ) temperature profile of the cross - section of the membrane .",

    "the extracted specific heat values from the 1d and 2d models show very comparable results .",

    "[ v3w(t ) ] . to assure that the frequency dependence of the 3@xmath2 comes only from thermal origin and there are no electrical dependencies , we assume that the two thermometers present an electrical capacitance . by fitting the 1@xmath2 wheatstone output voltage using the electrical model explained in the previous publication @xcite@xmath13 @xcite",
    ", we are able to estimate this capacitance to be around hundred picofarad and then can not affect the thermal frequency cut - off above 1  khz , which is above the frequency measurement range ( 1 to 100  hz ) .",

    "when the thermometer width is multiplied by a factor of eight , the extracted thermal conductivity varies at most by 10  @xmath53 , which is a weak effect .",
    "this effect can be explained by the fact that when the width of the thermometer becomes large as compared to the width of the membrane , a gradient of temperature between the centre and its extremity appears and thus can not be considered like a finite line oscillating at the same temperature to solve the heat transfer equation .        on the other hand , a significant effect of the thermometer width change on the specific heat values was observed .",
    "an increase of 65  @xmath53 was observed when the thermometer width is multiplied by a factor of eight .",
