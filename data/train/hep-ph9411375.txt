    "the study of particle - soliton interactions over the last 20 years has led to the discovery of novel physical phenomena ( for a few such examples , see @xcite ) .",
    "some of these phenomena have been successfully tested in condensed matter systems where solitons abound and the ideas have also been widely applied to hypothetical particle physics situations .",
    "these beautiful ideas are also relevant to the standard model of particle physics even though the model does not contain any _ topological _ defects .",
    "this is because the ideas have applicability even when the solitons are not truly topological and there are a number of such `` non - topological '' solitons present in the standard model . in this paper",
    "we shall apply some of these ideas to the electroweak @xmath0string - a flux tube containing magnetic flux of the @xmath2 boson @xcite .",
    "several facets of the @xmath0string have been studied over the past few years and recently the attention has turned to their interactions with the particles in the standard model .",
    "earnshaw and perkins@xcite have found the quark and lepton zero modes on a straight @xmath0string .",
    "this means that @xmath0strings are superconducting and can carry of order @xmath3 amperes of electric current . in another paper",
    "it was shown that linked loops of @xmath0string carry baryon number@xcite .",
    "this result was derived by integrating out the anomaly equation for the baryonic current and did not explicitly consider the fermions interacting with the string .",
    "the moment seems ripe for a more direct computation of the baryon number and other charges on linked loops of @xmath0string .",
    "this is the underlying motivation for the present work .",
    "the technical analysis given in this paper is inspired by earlier work in which the spectral flow in non - trivial backgrounds was studied .",
    "in particular , the paper by manton on schwinger electrodynamics in 1 + 1 dimensions@xcite was immensely helpful as the situation there closely resembles the problem at hand .    the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we set up our conventions , describe electroweak @xmath0strings and recapitulate known results on fermionic zero modes . in section 3 we describe two cases in which the dirac equation for the fermionic zero modes can be solved completely in terms of the string profile functions . in both cases we need to assume the bogomolnyi limit@xcite in which the masses of the scalar and vector fields making up the string are equal . in the first of the two cases , the fermion is massless ( such as the neutrino ) while in the second case we have a `` super - bogomolnyi '' limit in which the fermion mass is equal to the scalar and vector masses and the @xmath0charge on the left - handed fermion vanishes",
    "then , in section 4 , we describe what happens to bosonic zero modes on linked strings as this is the simplest situation .",
    "the main results of this paper are found in section 5 , where we discuss lepton and quark zero modes on linked loops of electroweak @xmath0string .",
    "here we evaluate the energy , angular momentum and the electromagnetic and baryonic currents on the strings .",
    "one outcome of this evaluation is that the ground state energy of fermions on linked strings is lower than that on unlinked strings .",
    "we also confirm previous findings that linked loops of @xmath0string carry baryon number @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the number of fermion families and @xmath6 is the weinberg angle .",
    "in addition , we show that the linked strings necessarily carry electromagnetic currents in their ground state .",
    "we extend our analysis to loops with linkage greater than one and plot the energy as a function of linkage .",
    "we conclude in section 6 and outline a gravitational situation that resembles the system of linked strings and which may have physics similar to that discussed in this paper .",
    "the bosonic sector of the standard model of the electroweak interactions describes an @xmath7 invariant theory with a scalar field @xmath8 in the fundamental representation of @xmath9 .",
    "it is described by the lagrangian : @xmath10b where , @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the field strengths for the @xmath9 and @xmath15 gauge fields @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively . also , @xmath18 @xmath19 where , @xmath20 is a complex doublet .",

    "the indices @xmath25 and @xmath26 refer to left- and right - handed components .",
    "in our analysis we will only be dealing with one fermion family at a time and hence we shall not be considering the effects of family mixing such as occurs due to the km matrix . for our purpose , this simplification is justified because the string configuration has vanishing charged currents .",
    "it is known that in the neutral current sector the gauge and mass matrices can be diagonalized simultaneously@xcite and hence there are no complications involving family mixingstrings necessarily involves the charged current sector and we expect family mixing effects ( such as cp violation ) to be present in such processes . ] .",

    "this effectively reduces the bosonic part of the lagrangian to an abelian - higgs model .",

    "in this section we give explicit solutions to the dirac equations in ( [ 2.20a ] ) and ( [ 2.20b ] ) in two special cases .",

    "we will only remark that the question applies regardless of whether the loops are linked or not and so the issue has no bearing on the difference in energies between linked and unlinked loops given in ( [ diffe ] ) .    the energy momentum for fermions can be found by varying the action with respect to the metric and is : @xmath242 \\ . \\label{tmn}\\ ] ] this leads to the result that the magnitude of the fermion momentum along the string is equal to the energy of the fermion - a result which could also be deduced by noting that the fermions are massless on the string . now to find the total momentum , we should recall that the electron and @xmath59 quark travel in one direction while the neutrino and @xmath61 quark travel in the opposite direction .",
    "using this fact , we find that the magnitude of the angular momentum due to the fermionic ground state on one of the strings is : @xmath243 when the linkage is one .    in non - trivial but symmetric backgrounds ,",

    "we show the expressions for the energy , angular momentum , charges and currents for one loop threaded by @xmath67 strings in terms of @xmath328 .",

    "2 . by changing the linking number , we can change @xmath319 in discrete steps and sample different points on the @xmath349 curve . since @xmath349 does not have a monotonic dependence on @xmath319 , the energy of strings that are linked @xmath67 times bears no simple relation to those linked @xmath324 times .",
    "in particular , the energy does not continue to decrease as we consider strings that have higher linkage .",
    "the lowest energy possible is when @xmath350 but , if @xmath49 is irrational , there will not be any value of the linkage for which @xmath319 will be @xmath230 .",

    "2 has the interpretation of a potential for the quantity @xmath319 and tells us which values of @xmath319 are most favoured . in a physical situation ,",
    "however , we should calculate the free energy which would be large for large linkage .",
    "this would remove the degeneracy between minima of different linkage and , for high enough string density , we would probably be left with two degenerate global minima - one occurring at some positive value of @xmath319 and another at the negative of this value .",
    "in this paper we have studied boson and fermion zero modes on linked string configurations including the case when the boson or fermion has an aharanov - bohm interaction with the string . from this analysis",
    "we can calculate the various charges on the linked strings .",
    "we confirm that the baryon number on linked loops of electroweak string is that found in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath351 .",
    "in addition , our direct calculations enable us to calculate the electric charge , electric current and electomagnetic current on the linked strings .",
    "the charge vanishes on singly linked unit winding string loops but the electric and baryonic currents are non - vanishing . for strings with higher linking numbers , the situation gets more complicated .",
    "while the energy of linked strings is always less than the energy of unlinked strings , the energy is not a monotonic function of the linking number and fluctuates as shown in fig .",
    "2 . in the bosonic case",
    ", we also find that the ground state of the linked configuration is current carrying .",
    "we have found a `` super - bogomolnyi '' limit in which the dirac equations for the fermions can be reduced by one order to an algebraic equation .",
    "this is the limit when the scalar , vector and fermion masses are all equal and the charge of the left - handed fermion vanishes .",
    "probably this limit and the result are related to a manifestation of supersymmetry but we are not aware of a discussion of this point in the literature .    finally , we propose that there may be a gravitational analogue of the system of linked strings .",
    "this is because a particle moving in a conical space - such as produced by a cosmic string - has a gravitational aharanov - bohm interaction with the line source that produces the conical space . then if we consider two circular line sources each of fixed radius @xmath70 , the total source length in the absence of linkage is simply @xmath352 .",
    "but if the sources are linked , the gravitational aharanov - bohm effect reduces the total length of the sources to @xmath353 where @xmath354 is the conical deficit angle produced by the sources .",
    "so the linked sources have less length for the same radius as compared to the unlinked sources .",
    "this is the gravitational analogue of the result that the ground state of linked strings is lower than the ground state of unlinked strings .",
    "even though there are traveling wave solutions ( `` zero modes '' ) on gravitating strings @xcite , there does not seem to be any gravitational analogue of the currents that run along linked strings - at least , in the context of static , conical spaces in conventional general relativity .",
    "this is because there is nothing to distinguish one direction along the line source over the other .",
    "however , it may be that there are non - vanishing currents along the sources if the linked sources are spinning @xcite .",
    "we feel that this system is worth exploring further .",
