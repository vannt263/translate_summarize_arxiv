    "fractures are the breaks in rocks caused by the huge stresses resulting from plate tectonics .",
    "it is of fundamental importance for geophysicists to be able to determine the position and the properties of fractures ( such as their thickness ) to be able to make predictions about the mechanical properties of a fractured platform or the diffusion of a pollutant , for instance .",
    "elastic waves are commonly used for this purpose .",
    "when the wavelengths are much larger than the distance between fractures , the fractures are generally not studied individually , and homogenization theories are applied . otherwise , as in the case of the present study , it is possible to study single fractures .",
    "if , in addition , the wavelengths are much larger than the thickness of the fractures , the latter can be modeled in terms of interfaces with appropriate jump conditions .    many experimental , theoretical and numerical studies have dealt with wave propagation across thin and single fractures in terms of linear jump conditions @xcite .",
    "the linear framework provides an appealing approach but it may not be very realistic , since non - physical penetration of both sides of the fractures may occur .",
    "some authors have proposed more accurate fracture models , such as the bandis - barton model @xcite .",

    "we combine an _ interface method _ with a classical numerical scheme for wave propagation , namely the ader scheme @xcite .",
    "the interface method involves changing this scheme locally , using the jump conditions at the interface ; moreover , it gives a subcell resolution when the interface does not coincide with the meshing .",
    "many interface methods have been proposed since the 90 s ; see @xcite for a review . here , we adapt the explicit simplified interface method ( esim ) previously developed for dealing with linear contacts @xcite ; see @xcite for an overview of the principles and advantages of this method .",

    "however , instabilities are observed when the physical parameters differ considerably between the two sides of an interface . in practice , this is not penalizing when dealing with realistic media .",
    "the nonlinear system ( [ sysnl ] ) may have more than one solution , and we can not be sure that newton s algorithm selects the right one . to check this point",
    ", we compare the numerical value @xmath183 obtained by solving ( [ sysnl ] ) with the semi - analytical value deduced from ( [ ode ] ) and ( [ supm ] ) . for weak to moderate nonlinear effects , the numerical value and the semi - analytical value are the same ( up to the accuracy of the integrations ) .",
    "but when the nonlinear effects are large , convergence towards a wrong solution can occur if the mesh used is too coarse .",
    "this is not very surprising : since wave profiles tend to be stiffened ( see section [ secexp ] ) , the taylor expansions in ( [ taylorm ] ) and ( [ taylorp ] ) give rather poor estimates .",
    "the strategy followed in section [ secexp ] consists in using a finer mesh .",
    "a better strategy might consist in solving ( [ sysnl ] ) with the constraint @xmath184 , as required by ( [ jcbb ] ) .",
    "we study a 400-m domain fractured at @xmath185 m , with parameters @xcite @xmath186 c_0=c_1=2800\\,\\mbox {   m / s } , \\quad \\quad \\ , d=6.1\\,10^{-4}\\,\\mbox{m}.   \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] since @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the same on both sides of @xmath23 , the reflected wave and the distorsion of the transmitted wave are induced only by the mechanical behavior of the fracture .",
    "many numerical experiments have been tested successfully with different physical parameters on both sides of @xmath23 .      [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     as a last test , we simulate a time - harmonic experiment .",
    "to do so , we slightly change the system under study : instead of ( [ ibvp ] ) , we solve @xmath187 \\displaystyle \\boldsymbol{u}(\\alpha^+,\\,t)=\\boldsymbol{d}_0 \\left(\\boldsymbol{u}(\\alpha^-,\\,t),\\,\\frac{\\textstyle \\partial}{\\textstyle \\partial\\,x}\\boldsymbol{u}(\\alpha^-,\\,t)\\right ) , \\\\ [ 8pt ] \\displaystyle \\boldsymbol{u}(x,\\,0)=\\boldsymbol{0 } \\quad \\mbox { for } x \\in \\mathbb{r } , \\end{array } \\right . \\label{source}\\ ] ] where @xmath188 is a source of mass that acts at @xmath189 m ( in @xmath5 ) . except for the source ,",
    "the parameters are the same than in subsection [ sectest1 ] .",
    "three values of @xmath190 are considered , yielding the three amplitudes @xmath191 : 0.01 m / s ( a ) , 0.1 m / s ( b ) , and 0.4 m / s ( c ) .",
    "the periodic values of the transmitted wave are recorded at @xmath192 m ; a decomposition into fourier series is then applied to these values .",
    "figure [ test3 ] shows the numerical values of @xmath10 on one period ( left column ) and the normalized coefficients of the fourier series ( right column ) .",
    "the harmonics generated when @xmath191 increases are clearly seen in this figure .",
    "there are two reasons for displaying these harmonics .",
    "first , they help to decide whether it is worthwhile taking the nonlinear effects into account : solving the nonlinear system ( [ sysnl ] ) at each time step is more costly than solving a linear system during a pre - processing step , as done with the linear jump conditions ( [ jclin ] ) in @xcite . in case ( a ) ,",
    "the answer is negative ; in case ( b ) , it depends on the accuracy required ; in case ( c ) , the answer is positive .",
    "secondly , the decrease in the harmonics is linked to the stiffness @xmath33 and the maximum allowable closure @xmath34 .",
    "it may therefore be possible to infer these values by inspecting the harmonics , which is a non - destructive means of evaluating the fracture .",
    "here we have studied the propagation of 1-d elastic compressional waves across a contact nonlinearity . the latter feature models a fracture in rocks , but it can also be a useful means of describing other physical situations , such as those encountered in the nondestructive evaluation of material for instance .",
    "the present study involves a physical description of the model , a theoretical analysis of its solution , and a numerical time - domain modeling .",
    "the numerical analysis of the interface method needs to be studied further to determine its accuracy and stability ( the latter point is still an open question in the linear context ) .",
    "the resolution of the nonlinear system ( [ sysnl ] ) needs also to be improved .",
    "lastly , it would be interesting to determine the harmonics generated across the fracture analytically , using the harmonic balance method .",
    "many difficulties need to be overcome before tackling realistic 2-d configurations .",
    "first , it is required to model the mechanical shear behavior of realistic fractures , along with the compressional behavior @xcite . these effects can be efficiently modeled in 1-d configurations .",
    "secondly , the 2-d treatment proposed in @xcite to deal with linear contacts is greatly intricated : the linear underdetermined systems of jump conditions are now nonlinear .",
    "thirdly , the computational extra - cost induced by the interface method is substantially higher : the extrapolation matrices used in the interface method need to be computed at each time step and at many grid points along the fracture .",
    "fourthly , if the nonlinear effects are large , a fine grid will be required to converge towards the right solution of the nonlinear systems . using a local mesh refinement around the fracture might therefore be a useful strategy here .          , _ fundamentals of rock fracture deformation _ , int",
