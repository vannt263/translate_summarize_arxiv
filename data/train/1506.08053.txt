    "in condensed matter physics , people are often interested in the ground state of the system and its low energy excitations .",
    "this allows people to focus only on the lowest bands of the systems by mapping the system to a lattice model with wannier functions  @xcite .",
    "the hubbard model is arguably the most famous of all such lattice models  @xcite .",
    "in addition , wannier functions are a more natural and better choice than bloch waves for narrow - band materials in computational physics  @xcite .",
    "there is a lot of freedom to choose a set of wannier functions as basis and there has been great efforts to find the best wannier functions  @xcite . however , all the discussion is done in the context of single - particle physics .",
    "the broadening of wannier functions by repulsive interaction seems have never been discussed in traditional condensed matter physics .",
    "the situation starts to change with the development of ultracold atomic physics , in particular , with the experimental observation of superfluid to mott transition in optical lattice  @xcite . in the early theoretical treatment of such a system , the mapping from the realistic continuous system to the bose - hubbard model",
    "is done with single particle wannier function  @xcite . however , due to the simplicity of the periodic potential and small energy scales in the system , it is tempting to think that the broadening of wannier function by the on - site repulsive interaction may have significant effect on the system .",
    "there have been many theoretical efforts  @xcite trying to give a good description of interaction effects on wannier function .",
    "there are also strong experimental evidences on the the broadening of wannier functions . in atomic clock experiment",
    "@xcite , atomic interaction is the main reason for frequency shift . in the experiment of @xmath2 atomic clock in optical lattice  @xcite ,",
    "nonuniform frequency shift was observed for different occupation number per site .",
    "this is clearly due to the broadening of wannier function by the repulsive atomic interaction .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , a self - consistent approach is developed to take account of the interaction effect on wannier function .",
    "the use of a different set of wannier functions will result in a different tunneling parameter @xmath0 and the on - site interaction @xmath1 for the lattice model and thus a different ground state .",
    "the self - consistent approach in ref .",
    "@xcite uses a general variational principle to choose the set of wannier functions that minimizes the ground state energy of the lattice model .",
    "this method is in spirit the same as the mctdhb theory  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we use the self - consistent approach in ref .",
    "@xcite to compute the interaction broadened wannier functions for a bose gas in an optical lattice .",
    "we focus on both the superfluid regime and the mott insulator regime .",
    "the wannier functions are used to calculate the tunneling parameter @xmath0 and the on - site interaction @xmath1 in the bose - hubbard model .",
    "they are found to be significantly affected by the @xmath3-wave scattering length , lattice strength , and most importantly the number of particles per site . in the end , we apply the approach to the experiment in ref .",

    "the nonlinear equations are solved in the superfluid regime for one dimensional optical lattice ; the tunneling parameter @xmath0 and on - site interaction @xmath1 are calculated with the changing of lattice depth and interaction strength . in section , we solve the nonlinear equations for the mott insulator regime where the expansion basis are single particle wannier functions ; @xmath0 and @xmath1 are calculated accordingly . in section",
    ", the theory is applied to the experiment in ref .",
    "@xcite and a good agreement is found between theory and experiment .",
    "in this section we give a brief summary on the self - consistent approach to compute the interaction effects on wannier functions developed in ref.@xcite .",
    "we consider a bose gas where the weak atomic interaction can be well described by the @xmath3-wave scattering .",
    "the second quantized hamiltonian for this kind of system is given by @xmath4\\hat{\\psi}(\\bm{r})}\\\\ + & \\frac{g_0}{2}\\int{d\\bm{r}[\\hat{\\psi}^{\\dagger}(\\bm{r})\\hat{\\psi}^{\\dagger}(\\bm{r})\\psi(\\bm{r})\\psi(\\bm{r})]}\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the atomic mass , @xmath6 is the external potential .",
    "we choose @xmath7 in this context , where @xmath8 is the optical lattice strength .",
    "and @xmath9 is the interaction strength related to the @xmath3-wave scattering length @xmath10 .",
    "the single - band approximation is to expand the bosonic field operator @xmath11 as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the first band wannier function at site @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the associated annihilation operator .",
    "the ground state @xmath16 in the single - band approximation can be generally written as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the function to be found by solving the resulted lattice model .",
    "the ground state energy @xmath19 certainly changes with the choice of wannier function @xmath20 .",
    "the best wannier function is the one that minimize the single - band ground state energy @xmath21 .",
    "mathematically , this is to do the following variation @xmath22 with the orthonormal constrains @xmath23 @xmath24 s are the usual lagrangian multipliers . with straightforward computation ,",
    "a nonlinear equation was obtained for the interacting wannier functions  @xcite    @xmath25    where @xmath26 represents averaging over the ground state of the system .",
    "the ground state is to be found with the bose - hubbard model @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 eq.([wannier ] ) and eq.([hubbard ] ) need to be solved self - consistently together to find the best wannier function @xmath30 .",

    "we use two different ways to compute @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the model : ( 1 ) with the single particle wannier function ; ( 2 ) with the interacting wannier function obtained self - consistently with eqs.([wannier],[hubbard ] ) .",
    "the ground state energy of this bose - hubbard model is compared for these two methods in fig .",
    "[ energy ] .",
    "the energy computed with the self - consistent method is indeed lower .",
    "[ wannierf ] shows one wannier function that we obtained in superfluid regime , which is apparently broadened due to the interaction .",

    ", we shall compute the broadened wannier function in both superfluid regime and mott regime for one dimensional systems .",
    "in the superfluid regime all the particles are condensed into the ground state of the system which is a bloch state ; it is more convenient to use the bloch basis .",
    "the nonlinear equations for bloch waves are  @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 with @xmath36 . in the superfluid phase",
    ", the bogoliubov mean - field theory@xcite can be used to determine and compute @xmath37 and other coefficients in eq.([bloch ] )  @xcite .",
    "there is no indeed to solve eq.([hubbard ] ) .    in the computation , we expand the bloch function @xmath38 with plane waves , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the volume of a cell and @xmath41 is the number of cells . after plugging the above equation into eq.([bloch ] )",
    ", we will obtain a set of nonlinear equations for @xmath42 .",
    "we solve these nonlinear equations numerically and then construct the wannier functions of different energy bands by carefully choosing the phases of all the bloch functions with kohn s method@xcite .",
    "[ blochbasis ] shows that @xmath0 and @xmath1 change with lattice strength @xmath8 and interaction parameter @xmath43 for different mean particle number on a single site @xmath44 .",
    "it is apparent that the atomic number per site does not change the overall trends but does change @xmath0 and @xmath1 significantly . as the result of broadening of wannier functions",
    ", @xmath0 increases with @xmath44 while @xmath1 decreases . in the range that we show in fig .",
    "[ blochbasis ] , @xmath0 with our approach can change up to @xmath45 compared to that of a single particle result at @xmath46 while @xmath1 can change up to @xmath47 .",
    "in deep mott - insulator regime the ground state can be approximated with @xmath48 , where @xmath44 is atom number per cite . as a result , the nonlinear equation for interacting wannier function in the mott regime",
    "is simplified to    @xmath49    we expand the wannier function in terms of single - particle wannier functions on the same site and its nearest neighbors ,    @xmath50,\\\\ \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath51 is the single particle wannier function for band @xmath52 and site @xmath14 . in this numerical calculation , we set @xmath53 and dimension for this section is 1d . with this expansion , we solve eq.([mott ] ) numerically to find the interaction - broadened wannier functions , and compute @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ wannierbasis ] .",
    "it is clear that the general trends that @xmath0 and @xmath1 change with @xmath43 and @xmath8 in the mott regime are similar to the ones in the superfluid regime .",
    "however , there are differences . specifically , as shown in fig .",
    "[ wannierbasis](a , c ) , the change of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 with @xmath44 has little dependence on the lattice depth @xmath8 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ wannierbasis ] , @xmath0 can change up to @xmath54 in our self - consistent approach at @xmath55 compared to that of single particle wannier function while @xmath1 can change up to @xmath56 .",
    "in atomic clock measurement , the clock frequency can shift due to collision of atoms . in an experiment reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , the atomic clock shift of @xmath2 was measured . in the experiment ,",
    "a @xmath2 bose - einstein condensate was prepared in the @xmath57 state and loaded into a 3d optical lattice . with the increase of the lattice depth",
    ", the system changed from superfluid phase to mott insulator ( mi ) phase . due to the trapping potential , the atomic gases was separated into mi shells each of which has a different occupation number @xmath44 per site .",
    "one can use radio wave to excite atoms in @xmath58 state to @xmath59 state . in different hyperfine states ,",
    "the scattering lengths between atoms are different .",
    "therefore , the atoms transferred to the @xmath59 state have a slightly different mean field energy ; this can cause a clock frequency shift , which is given by  @xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are scattering lengths for atoms in @xmath58 and @xmath59 state , respectively , and @xmath63 is scattering length between atom in @xmath58 state and atom in @xmath59 state . if the on - site interaction @xmath1 is calculated with single - particle wannier functions , this clock shift is independent of @xmath44 , the number of atoms per site .",
    "however , it was observed in the experiment , the clock shift decreases with @xmath44 as shown in fig .",
    "[ shift ] .        in our view ,",
    "this decrease of clock frequency shift in fig .",
    "[ shift ] is caused by the broadening of wannier function : when @xmath44 increases , the wannier function becomes broader and @xmath1 decreases as shown in fig .",
    "[ wannierbasis](c , d ) ; consequently , the clock shift decreases . with our self - consistent method , we calculated the 3d interacting wannier function for different atom number @xmath44 per site in 3d mott - insulator regime , and eventually @xmath1 and the clock shift @xmath64 .",
    "the results are compared to the experimental results in fig .",
    "[ shift ] ; there is a very good agreement .",
    "with a self - consistent theory developed earlier , we have computed the effect of interaction on single - band wannier function . in particular , we have considered both superfluid regime and mott regime .",
    "we found that as the result of broadening of wannier function by interaction , the tunneling parameter @xmath0 and @xmath1 can change significantly .",
    "our theory was applied to a clock shift experiment : a very good agreement was found between our theoretical results and experimental results .",
    "the regime near the transition from superfluid to mott insulator is not studied in this work and will be investigated in the future .",
