    "in many quantum chemistry applications , such as to excited states , non - equilibrium geometries , and transition - metal chemistry , the mean - field description of electron interactions is insufficient .",
    "the deviation from mean - field behaviour of the electrons , i.e. electron correlation , is usually classified into two types : static or non - dynamic correlation , and dynamic correlation .",
    "conventionally , static correlation is the correlation between near - degenerate valence orbitals , and can be treated by considering the set of possible configurations of electrons in the set of active valence orbitals .",
    "if all such configurations are included and the orbitals are simultaneously optimized , one arrives at the complete active space self - consistent - field ( casscf ) model@xcite , the most widely used method to describe static correlation .",
    "dynamic correlation is the correlation between valence orbitals and the remaining empty ( virtual ) or doubly occupied ( core ) states .",
    "this effect is thought of as captured by low particle - rank excitations , such as used in perturbation theories ( pt)@xcite , configuration interaction singles and doubles ( cisd)@xcite , or coupled cluster theory ( cc)@xcite . the combined treatment of static and dynamic correlation is the domain of multireference correlation theories , such as multi - reference perturbation theories ( mrpt )  @xcite , multi - reference configuration interaction ( mrci )  @xcite or multi - reference coupled cluster theories ( mrcc )  @xcite .",
    "the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite has made it possible to employ large active spaces to describe static correlation@xcite and it has become straightforward to use the dmrg as a robust numerical solver in a variety of frontier applications , including benchmark solutions of small molecules@xcite , multi - center transition metal clusters@xcite , as well as to molecular crystals@xcite",
    ". there have been several efforts to further include dynamic correlation on top of the dmrg reference .",
    "for example , dmrg - ct  @xcite , dmrg - caspt2  @xcite , dmrg - cu(4)-mrci  @xcite ( in an internally contracted ( ic ) formulation ) and mps - pt  @xcite and mps - lcc  @xcite ( in an uncontracted formulation ) are all attempts in this direction",
    ". there have also been efforts to combine dmrg with density functional theory ( dft )  @xcite . in the internally contracted multireference methods , high order reduced density matrices ( rdm ) of the dmrg active space wavefunction are required .",
    "such density matrices , although simple in a theoretical sense , are computationally non - trivial to obtain .    in this work ,",
    "we have developed a general algorithm to efficiently compute high order reduced density matrices from dmrg wave functions .",
    "using these rdm calculations , we may then implement a variety of methods to treat electron correlation external to the dmrg active space .",
    "as an example of this , we have implemented the strongly contracted variant of second order @xmath0-electron valence state perturbation theory ( nevpt2 ) @xcite , an intruder - state - free multireference perturbation theory , on top of the dmrg reference wavefunction , to yield a method we call dmrg - sc - nevpt2 . to demonstrate the potential of this approach ,",
    "we apply the method to study the potential energy curve of the chromium dimer , and to compute the excitation energies of the trimer of the quasi - one dimensional conjugated poly(p - phenylene vinylene ) ( ppv(n=3 ) ) .",
    "the chromium dimer is a particularly demanding small molecule that has been widely studied with many techniques@xcite , and thus forms a good test bed to demonstrate the performance of dmrg - sc - nevpt2 . using an active space with 22 orbitals and basis sets extrapolated to the complete basis set ( cbs ) limit , we show that we can compute both the spectroscopic constants and the full curve , with an accuracy that compares quite favourably to earlier calculations .",
    "ppv on the other hand , is of interest as a prototypical light - emitting polymer@xcite .",
    "light emission relies on the correct ordering of the first optically bright @xmath1 state and dark @xmath2 state , and describing this ordering requires an appropriate treatment of electron correlation  @xcite . with dmrg - sc - nevpt2",
    ", we show that we can compute the excitation energies and energy ordering of the different states accurately , starting from the full - valence active @xmath3 space of the molecule .",
    "as with other wavefunction methods in quantum chemistry , dmrg is based on a wavefunction ansatz , namely the matrix product state ( mps ) . an mps is a non - linear wavefunction , built from a contraction of tensors for each orbital in the basis .",
    "if an mps is composed of tensors with a limited dimension ( called the bond dimension , @xmath4 ) it explores only a physically motivated , but restricted , subset of the hilbert space . by increasing @xmath4 , the mps ansatz",
    "will then converge to the full configuration interaction ( fci ) result .",
    "the dmrg algorithm provides a combination of renormalization and truncation steps that efficiently find a variational and optimal mps . in practice , two slightly",
    "different types of mps are used in practical dmrg calculations : the one - site and two - site mps .",
    "the one - site mps is defined as @xmath5 here , @xmath6 is the occupacy of orbital @xmath7 , one of @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the number of orbitals . for a given @xmath6 , @xmath10 is an @xmath11 matrix , except for the first and last ones ; the dimensions of @xmath12 and @xmath13 are @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively .",
    "this ensures that for a given occupancy string @xmath16 the @xmath17 product yields a scalar , namely , the coefficient of the determinant @xmath18 .",
    "similarly , the two - site mps is defined as @xmath19 the only difference with the one - site mps , is that one of the tensors ( @xmath20 ) is associated with two sites at a time .",
    "the two - site mps thus has slightly more variational freedom than the one - site mps , and further exists in different non - equivalent forms , depending on which sites are chosen for the special two - site tensor .    in the dmrg sweep algorithm",
    ", @xmath21 is variationally optimized , and a single tensor ( @xmath22 in a one - site mps or @xmath23 in a two - site mps ) is updated at site @xmath7 during the sweep .",
    "this update leads to solving an eigenvalue problem of an effective `` superblock '' hamiltonian , which is a @xmath24 matrix .",
    "the multiplication between this effective hamiltonian and a mps is usually computed using @xmath25 `` normal '' and `` complementary '' operators built from different sets ( blocks ) of the active orbitals .",
    "the cost of this eigenvalue problem is @xmath26 for a single tensor update , and @xmath27 for a whole sweep optimization .",
    "as discussed , a two - site mps has more variational freedom than a one - site mps at the site where the special tensor is placed .",
    "this allows the dmrg optimization to change quantum numbers , i.e. conserved local symmetries , during the sweep , and thus helps avoid local minima .",
    "further , the discarded weight associated with the renormalization step in a two - site mps sweep optimization can be used to extrapolate away the residual error due to finite bond dimension @xmath4 . however , as the two - site mps wavefunction at each step of the sweep is slightly different ( because the special tensor is moved along the sweep ) , the two - site formalism does not provide a unique definition of the dmrg expectation values .",
    "thus , to evaluate the reduced density matrix , we complete the dmrg sweep optimization in the one - site representation , to obtain a single dmrg wavefunction .",
    "this is referred to as the `` two - site to one - site '' algorithm ( a two - site mps optimization followed by a one - site one )  @xcite . from here on when we refer to an mps , we will mean the one - site mps .",
    "high order rdm s are common in post - active space methods that are used to capture the `` dynamic '' correlation outside of the active space , such as multireference configuration interaction@xcite and multireference perturbation theory@xcite .",
    "the expression of quantities in terms of rdm s is a feature of the internally contracted formulations , which avoid the expansion of the external correction to the active space wavefunction explicitly in terms of many - particle basis states ( such as slater determinants or configuration state functions ) .",
    "internally contracted caspt2@xcite and nevpt2@xcite ( both strongly and partially contracted variants ) require the four - particle rdm , while higher levels of correlation can require even higher order rdm s .    in principle",
    ", the evaluation of rdm s in dmrg is straightforward ; the evaluation of a matrix element such as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is an mps , is an operation of @xmath30 cost and can be carried out within any standard dmrg implementation . however , a naive algorithm which evaluates each rdm element separately would lead to far too high a computational cost . instead , the efficient evaluation of the rdm s of an mps requires forming suitable dmrg renormalized operators which can be reused in _ all _ rdm elements @xmath31 . such efficient algorithms to build the 2-rdm were proposed some years ago by several groups  @xcite , and require only @xmath32 cost , as opposed to the @xmath33 cost arising in a naive element by element evaluation . the efficient algorithm to build the 3-rdm",
    "was introduced by kurashige and yanai .",
    "@xcite here we introduce a more general algorithm that automatically organises the necessary dmrg renormalized operators for any order of rdm .      to organize the efficient and non - redundant evaluation of the rdm elements , we label each element in terms of two classifiers : its `` type pattern '' ( which describes the pattern of creation and annihilation operators , ordered by the sites on the lattice ) , and its `` number pattern '' ( which describes how to partition the creation and annihilation operators ) . the complete set of rdm elements can be then be obtained efficiently with proper reuse of intermediates in a dmrg sweep , by looping over all type patterns , and all indices corresponding to given number patterns , at each step of the sweep ( with a few restrictions associated with edge cases near the ends of the sweep , described in the appendix ) , building the dmrg renormalized operators corresponding to the given type and number patterns , and forming the appropriate contractions with the dmrg renormalized wavefunction .",
    "the type pattern is precisely defined as follows .",
    "consider an rdm element @xmath34 .",
    "we reorder the indices such that the indices of the creation and annihilation operators are arranged successively in the order as they appear in the dmrg site ordering : @xmath35 , with @xmath36 and where @xmath37 is either @xmath38 or @xmath39 . the corresponding binary pattern of 2@xmath0 ( where @xmath0 is the rank of the rdm ) creation and annihilation operators appearing in the above operator string is the type pattern of the rdm matrix element .",
    "the number pattern encodes how to partition the labels of the expectation value in @xmath40 onto different blocks in the dmrg sweep , so as to maximize the reuse of dmrg renormalized operators .",
    "recall that a dmrg sweep consists of a sequence of operations over the orbitals ; at each step in the dmrg sweep , there is the set of orbitals preceding the current orbital ( the system block ( @xmath41 ) ) , the current orbital ( the dot block ( @xmath42 ) ) , and the set of orbitals whose associated site tensors have yet to be optimized ( the environment block ( @xmath43 ) ) .",
    "the intermediates in the construction of an rdm matrix element are dmrg renormalized operators built and stored on the three blocks . to determine the renormalized operators to build , we partition the @xmath44 orbital labels of the operator @xmath45 among the 3 blocks .",
    "the most efficient partitioning ( when generating the full set of rdm elements ) is to compute a given element from renormalized operators with the maximum number of orbital labels appearing on the dot block , and an equal number of orbital labels on the system and environment blocks . for typical rdm elements ( i.e. not for elements such as @xmath46 )",
    ", at least one orbital label can be placed on @xmath47 and at most @xmath48 orbital labels on @xmath49 by choosing an appropriate position of the dot site ( i.e. the step in the dmrg sweep ) .",
    "the numbers \\{@xmath50,@xmath51,@xmath52 } then denote the numbers of orbital labels distributed on the different blocks , and this is the number pattern .",
    "one can generate all valid number patterns by considering all cases where the number of orbital labels on @xmath53 is no more than @xmath0 , that on @xmath47 is no more than 4 and that on @xmath49 is no more than @xmath48 , and the total is @xmath44 except for some edge cases for the first step and last step in the sweep , as discussed in the appendix . the number pattern and type pattern for a representative rdm element is illustrated in fig .",

    "with appropriate intermediates , the total cost of this step for an @xmath0-rdm computation is @xmath69 .      through the above steps , an expectation value such as @xmath70 is obtained . for a non - spin - adapted dmrg algorithm , where @xmath71 are simple creation and annihilation operators , we",

    "the spin tensor creation and annihilation operators can be expanded as a linear combination of spin orbital creation and annihilation operators , leading to a set of linear equations to obtain the spin orbital rdm elements from a single spin reduced matrix element . using singlet embedding @xcite , expectation values for the spin tensor combinations with non - zero total spin are zero , significantly decreasing the number of expectation values to compute .",
    "the coefficients appearing in the linear equations are the same for all operators with the same pattern and can thus be generated automatically and reused .",
    "the cost of this process is independent of the dmrg bond dimension @xmath4 , and is thus negligible compared to the other parts of the rdm calculation .",
    "we now briefly review the strongly contracted nevpt2@xcite , a second - order multireference perturbation theory .",
    "the target zeroth - order wave function is defined as @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the projector onto the cas space .",
    "the zeroth order hamiltonian is chosen in the form given by dyall@xcite : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a one - electron ( diagonal ) operator in the non - active ( core and external ) subspace : @xmath83 indices @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 refer to canonical core orbitals , active orbitals and canonical virtual orbitals , respectively , and @xmath87 and @xmath88 are orbital energies .",
    "@xmath89 is a two - electron operator confined to the active space : @xmath90 where @xmath91 ; and @xmath92 is a constant defined as @xmath93 to ensure that @xmath94 is equivalent to the full hamiltonian within the cas space .",
    "the zeroth order wave functions external to the cas space are referred to as the `` perturber functions '' .",
    "a perturber function is written as @xmath95 .",
    "it belongs to a cas space denoted @xmath96 , where @xmath9 is the number of electrons promoted to ( @xmath97 ) or removed from ( @xmath98 ) the active space , @xmath99 denotes the occupancy of nonactive orbitals and @xmath100 enumerates the various perturber functions in @xmath101 . in strongly contracted nevpt2 , only one perturber function for each @xmath101 subspace is used .",
    "this leads to less variational freedom in the hylleraas functional than partially contracted and uncontracted nevpt2 , and due to the smaller variational freedom , strongly contracted nevpt2 will yield a higher value for the perturbation theory energy  @xcite . in general , however , the contribution of contraction to relative energies is often small on the chemical energy scale , and for recent results exploring the effect of contraction , we refer to ref .",
    "the strongly contracted perturber function is defined as @xmath102 , where @xmath96 is the projector onto the space .",
    "the energy of the perturber function is @xmath103 the zeroth order hamiltonian then becomes @xmath104 where @xmath105 corresponds to the normalized @xmath106 .",
    "the bottleneck in sc - nevpt2 is the evaluation of the energies of the perturber functions , where up to the 4-rdm appears .",
    "this 4-rdm is subsequently contracted with two electron integrals in the active space to form auxiliary matrices.@xcite computing the 4-rdm requires @xmath107 cost , much higher than that of a standard dmrg energy optimization .",
    "to minimize the cost , it is generally necessary to evaluate the 4-rdm using a lower bond dimension than is used in the dmrg energy optimization of @xmath108 . to obtain an mps approximation of lower bond dimension for the reference , we `` compress '' the converged reference mps of a larger bond dimension",
    "this is done in practice by carrying out a `` reverse schedule '' set of sweeps in a dmrg code , where @xmath4 is decreased .",
    "@xcite all of our dmrg - sc - nevpt2 calculations use reference mps that have been compressed in this way to compute the rdm s .",
    "the compressed bond dimension is denoted @xmath109 .",
    "further , to avoid storage problems in our implementation of dmrg - sc - nevpt2 , the 4-rdm is computed on the fly . in principle , it is possible to completely avoid generating the 4-rdm by directly computing the auxiliary matrices ( i.e. with the integrals already contracted ) .",
    "this is the approach taken , for example , in kurashige and yanai s original implementation of dmrg - caspt2  @xcite , where the auxiliary matrices can be computed with a cost scaling similar to that of the 3-rdm , using special kinds of dmrg renormalized operators as intermediates .",
    "however , the dyall hamiltonian in nevpt2 involves all the active - space two - electron integrals , and this is more complicated to handle than the diagonal fock energies that appear in the caspt2 zeroth hamiltonian ( in its canonical representation ) .",
    "thus , although the scaling of such an algorithm may be lower , it is complicated to implement and the computational prefactor is large due to the many different intermediates that need to be considered .",
    "we have implemented such an algorithm only in our reference nevpt2 code that uses casci type reference wavefunctions , and not in our dmrg - sc - nevpt2 code .",
    "the chromium dimer has been a challenging molecule for quantum chemistry for many years .",
    "this is because a relatively large active ( 12@xmath66 , 12@xmath37 ) space is needed to describe the minimal spin - recoupling of the electrons involved in the nominal sextuple bond , while , at the same time , a large amount of dynamic correlation is required even to yield a bound potential energy curve .",
    "@xcite the minimal ( 12@xmath66,12@xmath37 ) cas , derived from the 3d and 4s atomic orbitals , has been widely employed in earlier chromium dimer calculations .",
    "@xcite although these earlier calculations could reproduce the general shape of the potential energy curve , they also have a number of shortcomings .",
    "for example , both caspt2@xcite and nevpt2@xcite based on the casscf(12@xmath66,12@xmath37 ) reference function significantly overestimate the dissociation energy of the molecule , especially when large basis sets ( e.g. those including g- , h- , or i- type functions ) are used.@xcite further , with nevpt3 , @xcite starting from the cas(12@xmath66,12@xmath37 ) wavefunction results in a large correction to the nevpt2 result and an unphysical potential energy curve . these various results suggest that ( at least when used with low orders of perturbation theory and internally contracted formulations which have a limited ability to relax the reference ) the minimal ( 12@xmath66,12@xmath37 ) cas is too small for a quantitative description .    further , when using caspt2 , the results are also sensitive to the choice of the zeroth - order hamiltonian and the level shift employed.@xcite this is especially true for the ( 12@xmath66,12@xmath37 ) active space , but sensitivity can still be seen even in dmrg - caspt2 calculations with a large ( 12@xmath66,28@xmath37 ) cas derived from the 3@xmath110 , 4@xmath64 , 4@xmath68 , 4@xmath110 atomic orbitals .",

    "this indicates that the semi - core correlations in this system are described well at the second - order perturbation theory level and that double shell effects should be dealt with at a higher level of theory .",

    "in this work we described an efficient and general algorithm to compute high order rdm s from a dmrg wave function . these rdm s may be used as the starting point for many kinds of internally contracted dynamic correlation methods .",
    "using up to the 4th order rdm , we combined dmrg and strongly contracted nevpt2 to obtain an intruder state free second order multireference perturbation theory that can be used with large active spaces .    to demonstrate the capability of the dmrg - sc - nevpt2 method , we calculated the potential energy curve of the chromium dimer and the excited states of ppv(n=3 ) . for the chromium dimer ,",
    "the best extended active space included the so called `` double d '' shell .",
    "our obtained curve compares quite favourably with earlier calculations and tracks the experimental curve very closely , except at very long bond - lengths where the experimental inversion may be suspect .",
    "we find that the semi - core orbitals are much less important for an accurate description of this curve . for ppv(n=3 ) , using an active space containing the full set of @xmath129 orbitals , we found that the dynamic correlation included through nevpt2 allowed us to obtain a correct ordering of the low - lying excited states , and the lowest excitation energy is in good agreement with the experimental data . in summary , these examples paint an optimistic picture for the potential of applying the dmrg - sc - nevpt2 method developed here to a wide range of challenging problems .",
    "all number patterns in the @xmath0-rdm , \\{@xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 } , need to be computed if @xmath130    however , there are some rdm elements , whose indices can not be arranged as described above , because too many of the indices lie on the first or last site .",
    "we need additional number patterns to compute these elements .    for the first step of the dmrg sweep , additional patterns are added .",
    "these patterns satisfy @xmath131    for the last step of the dmrg sweep , additional patterns are also added .",
    "these patterns satisfy @xmath132    because @xmath53 ( or @xmath49 ) is composed of a single site in the first or last step of the sweep , the expectation value of an operator with more than two @xmath38 s or two @xmath39 s is zero . finally , the number of indices on single sites should not exceed 4 .",
    "it is a waste of resources to compute rdm elements which are zero or redundant .",
    "further rdm elements can be computed through several choices of combinations of operators .",
    "we implemented restrictions to skip the calculations of zero and redundant rdm elements .",
    "the operators @xmath133 and @xmath134 are first permuted , so that the orbital indices do not decrease . only permutations between two operators with different orbital indices are needed .",
    "if @xmath133 precedes @xmath134 and @xmath135 , the corresponding compound operators are not required in the rdm calcualtion . for a single site block , the compound operator with @xmath38 ahead of @xmath39 is omitted . for other blocks",
    ", the loop over @xmath136 should satisfy @xmath137 ( @xmath138 is only valid when the two adjacent operators are in normal order ) .",
    "further , the rdm ( but not the transition rdm ) is a hermitian matrix . using the 3-rdm as an example @xmath139 we can always use transposes and permutations to ensure that the operator string begins with @xmath39 rather than @xmath38 . therefore , all type patterns begining with @xmath38 are omitted .    similarly , if an operator begins with @xmath140 , @xmath141 or @xmath142 , the remaining set of operators also has transpose and permutation symmetry .",
    "e.g. : @xmath143 where @xmath144 .",
    "thus , there is no need to compute type patterns where @xmath38 follows @xmath140 .",
