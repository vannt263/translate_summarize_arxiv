    "two - dimensional graphene , being one of the most promising contemporary materials @xcite offers unique physical properties due to its electronic structure.@xcite since its discovery it has attracted concerted theoretical and experimental efforts aimed at understanding its rich physics and making basis for future electronics .",
    "one of the directions is focused on integrating the charge and spin degrees of freedom , to create novel spintronic devices.@xcite this encourages studies of magnetic properties of graphene .",
    "recently , increasing interest has been focused on the graphene nanostructures.@xcite such nanostructures can be engineered to merge the properties of graphene with ultrasmall sizes , and can serve as possible building blocks of novel devices ( see for example refs .  ) , especially in context of transport properties , showing giant magnetoresistance.@xcite significant efforts are made to understand magnetism emerging in finite - size graphene structures without magnetic impurities introduced ( an extensive review of that particular topic is presented in the ref .  ) .",
    "however , the possibility of introducing magnetic impurity atoms to the graphene lattice is also taken into account.@xcite    among the topics attracting the interests of researchers , the problem of indirect magnetic coupling between magnetic impurity spins in graphene , mediated by charge carriers , is worth mentioning .",
    "this kind of interaction , known as ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) coupling,@xcite can be expected to show unique properties in graphene , different from the behaviour in two - dimensional metals,@xcite owing to the peculiar , linear dispersion relation for the charge carriers in the vicinity of dirac points .",
    "various calculations of rkky interaction in graphene sheets are present in the literature , exploiting the bipartite nature of the graphene crystalline lattice in various ( mainly perturbational ) approaches.@xcite moreover , tight - binding calculations in real space were performed for such a system.@xcite recently , also the problem of two kondo impurities attracted some attention .",
    "@xcite    however , the main efforts have so far focused on the calculations of rkky coupling properties in infinite graphene planes . on the other hand , the coupling in ultrasmall nanoflakes ( or nanodisks , @xcite containing just a few hexagonal rings )",
    "can be expected to deviate from the predictions for infinite system , as the dominance of the edge in a nanoflake substantially modifies the electronic structure and severely breaks the translational symmetry .",
    "especially , the peculiar features of the electronic state at the zigzag edge of graphene ( or even graphite ) are known both from theoretical predictions@xcite and experimental observations for various systems ( e.g. ref .  ) ,",
    "especially quantum - dot systems.@xcite the significance of the edge structure has been already found for example in the transport properties of nanoflakes.@xcite moreover , in ultrasmall molecule - like structures , the existence of discrete electronic states significantly separated in energy allows us to expect a range of novel phenomena .",
    "therefore , a sound motivation appears for studies of rkky coupling between magnetic moments in nanosized graphene structures , which is the aim of the present work .    to achieve this goal",
    ", we use the real - space tight - binding approximation ( tba ) supplemented with the hubbard term for finite , ultrasmall graphene nanoflakes .",
    "we perform the exact diagonalization of the single - particle hamiltonian resulting from the mean field approximation ( mfa ) .",
    "not limiting the calculations to charge - neutral structures , we take into account the possibility of varying the charge concentration electron by electron ( charge doping )",
    ". one of our goals is to search for the configuration for which the coupling changes its character from ferro- to antiferromagnetic as a result of adding or removing a single electron from the system , in close vicinity to the equilibrium electron concentration . in principle , such a possibility might be opened by placing the nanostructure between two tunneling electrodes , providing a single - electron control of mutual orientation of impurity spins ( let us mention that the idea of doping - controlled coupling between magnetic moments in bilayer graphene has been very recently raised in the ref .  ) .",
    "the phenomenon of coulomb blockade in some graphene nanostructures with two electrodes was studied in ref .  , while another route to modifying the charge concentration is the absorption of gas molecules ( as shown in ref .  ) .",
    "the analysis of rkky interaction in graphene - based structures consisting of @xmath0 carbon atoms bases on the reliable description of the electronic properties .",
    "the most commonly used approach to that problem is the tba @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of the tba method is the ability to include the full , realistic band structure of graphene with finite bandwidth , not being restricted to the linear part of the dispersion relation close to dirac points .",
    "therefore , the use of certain cut - off schemes is not necessary to obtain convergent results and the issue of the possible unphysical modifications of the rkky range function is absent .",
    "moreover , the tba facilitates the non - perturbational treatment of the problem of magnetic impurities . in our study",
    "we will adopt this approach , taking into account the electronic hopping for nearest - neighbours only .",
    "the total hamiltonian for the ultrasmall graphene structure with two magnetic impurities can be written as @xmath1 and contains the contribution from the tba hopping term @xmath2 , hubbard term @xmath3 as well as impurity potential @xmath4 .",
    "the tba term has the following form : @xmath5 here , @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote creation and annihilation operators for @xmath8 electrons at sites @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the nanoflake , with spin @xmath11 .",
    "the summation over nearest - neighbour sites is denoted by @xmath12 .",
    "the parameter @xmath13 ( usually taken as 2.8 ev ) is the hopping integral between nearest neighbours . in the further numerical results , all the energies are normalized to @xmath13 .    in order to incorporate the electron - electron correlations induced by the coulombic interactions ,",
    "we include the hubbard term in the hamiltonian : @xmath14 with the electron number operators @xmath15 .",
    "the hubbard term , capturing the on - site coulombic repulsion only , neglects the long - range part of the interaction .",
    "the usefulness of this model is a subject of debate ( see the recent review in ref .  ) .",
    "however , it is of noticeably wide use in the theory of carbon ( nano)structures ; see refs .   and the recent work on carbon nanotubes in ref .   along the lines of the discussion in ref .",
    ", @xmath16 should be treated as an effective parameter describing the influence of coulombic interactions .",
    "its value might result from a competition between on - site repulsion and the interaction between electrons located on different sites ( especially nearest neighbour ) . also , some recent results evidence suppression of the influence of the long - range interactions @xcite .",
    "contrary to the choice of hopping integrals in the tba term , the situation with the value of on - site coulomb repulsion parameter @xmath16 appears less clear .",
    "the values accepted vary between @xmath17 ev @xcite and even @xmath18 ev.@xcite in our study , if we include the hubbard term , we accept a moderate value of @xmath19 , close to the choice of yazyev @xcite and potasz _ et al .",

    "we limit our further considerations to @xmath36 , in order not to lose the accuracy of electronic spectrum reproduction by means of the tba method .",
    "the rkky coupling energy between the impurity spins can be related to the difference of total energies by @xmath37 where the positive value of @xmath38 corresponds to ferromagnetic coupling ( f ) and the negative value to antiferromagnetic coupling ( af ) . in our case",
    "( when electronic structure description involves nn hopping only ) the coupling values calculated for @xmath39 are identical ( i.e. , electron and hole doping lead to the same results ) due to electron - hole transformation symmetry of the hamiltonian on the finite bipartite lattice .",
    "let us note that the indirect charge carrier mediated interaction resulting from our calculations can be not necessarily the usual form of rkky coupling , which is proportional to the square of the contact potential @xmath27 , as resulting from the second order perturbation calculus .",

    "[ fig : n161st ] ) coincides with antiferromagnetic sign of interaction . on the contrary , for odd numbers of electrons ( @xmath72 ) we deal with ferromagnetic interaction with @xmath73 .",

    "let us also observe that qualitatively the same situation is met in presence of the hubbard term , for @xmath19 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : n161stlog](b ) ] .",
    "it is worth special emphasis that the usual derivation of rkky exchange integral , within the framework of second - order perturbation calculus , yields always the coupling proportional to the square of the contact potential , which has been recently recapitulated for bipartite graphene lattice .",

    "thus , it can be deduced that for selected odd total electron numbers we deal with @xmath73 .    to investigate more deeply the selected case of two impurities in position 1a and @xmath77 and identify the origin of the mentioned unusual behaviour",
    ", we plot the energy difference between the af and f orientations of impurity spins ( note that @xmath78 ) as a function of the contact potential @xmath27 in fig .",
    "[ fig : n16deltae2](a ) . for @xmath77",
    ", the ground state is characterized by unequal number of spin - up and spin - down electrons . in the plot",
    "we resolve the contributions coming from the highest energy orbital occupied by a single electron as well as the total contribution originating from the lower energy orbitals occupied by pairs of electrons of opposite spins .",
    "it is noticeable that the latter contribution favours the af state and is proportional to @xmath79 for not too strong contact potentials ( as expected on the basis of second - order perturbation calculus ) . on the contrary ,",
    "the orbital occupied by a single electron gives rise to the energy difference which is proportional to @xmath27 and tends to prefer the f state of the impurities . in the limit of low @xmath27",
    ", the situation is ruled by the singly coupled state so that the total indirect exchange is ferromagnetic and linear in contact potential , while the increase of @xmath27 leads first to compensation of both contributions and then to domination of the ordinary perturbational @xmath79-proportional behaviour .",
    "the linearity of energy difference in @xmath27 can be explained basing on the fact that for a single electron occupying a given orbital , the leading correction to energy of the orbital [ coming from the term eq .",
    "( [ eq : himp1 ] ) in the hamiltonian ] is of the first- order perturbational kind .",
    "if the orbital is occupied by a pair of electrons with opposite spins , first - order corrections for them are of opposite values and cancel each other , while the second - order corrections give rise to the ordinary rkky interaction . however , when there is no second electron , the uncompensated first - order contribution dominates . under such circumstances , for f polarization of impurity spins , the first - order correction to the electronic orbital energy due to the presence of two impurities at sites @xmath24 and @xmath25",
    "amounts to @xmath80 ( corresponding to the direction of electron spin which minimizes the total energy ) .",
    "let us assume without loss of generality that @xmath81 .",
    "if the polarization of impurity spins is af , then the corresponding correction is @xmath82 .",
    "the resulting energy difference @xmath83 clearly makes a ferromagnetic contribution to the indirect coupling .",
    "its magnitude is proportional to the smaller of the electronic densities on the impurity pair sites ; thus it is maximized for equal electronic densities on both sites .",
    "such a contribution to indirect coupling yields some resemblance to the double exchange mechanism .",
    "@xcite however , let us still use the term rkky interaction to characterize the indirect charge carrier mediated coupling which results from our calculations .",
    "let us observe , that in some cases we deal with the situation when the electronic density for a given orbital @xmath46 vanishes at least at one of the sites at which the impurity spins are localized .",
    "such an orbital does not indicate any energy difference between af and f orientation of impurity spins and thus does not give any contribution to the rkky exchange integral .",
    "this is , for example , the case for @xmath84 and impurities in the 1a position ; see the corresponding electronic densities for the orbital @xmath85 in fig .",
    "[ fig : n16density](b ) , which is the highest energy orbital occupied by a single electron .",
    "such a situation prevents the indirect interaction from switching to the f sign ( like for @xmath72 ) , even though the total number of electrons in the system is odd .",
    "quite a similar situation can be observed for impurities in the 1b position , since the electronic density for the orbital @xmath86 also vanishes at one of the impurity sites .",
    "therefore , the coupling for @xmath33 and @xmath77 is exactly the same .",
    "we note that the value of @xmath38 is also unchanged for @xmath87 , which corresponds to the case when the highest energy orbital @xmath88 is occupied by two electrons with opposite spins .",
    "however , in that case we can observe that the unperturbed electronic densities are almost equal at both 1b impurity sites .",
    "therefore , the af state of impurities changes the orbital energy particularly weakly [ as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : n16deltae](b ) for @xmath88 ] and the energy changes for spin - up and spin - down electron for f impurity polarization cancel each other .",
    "therefore , a doubly occupied state @xmath88 also gives a particularly weak contribution to exchange integral .",
    "this explains the robustness of weak af rkky coupling for 1b pair location with respect to deviations from charge neutrality . on the other hand , the same feature of the @xmath88 orbital when it is singly occupied gives rise to a particularly strong ferromagnetic contribution to the coupling ( seen clearly for @xmath90 , when @xmath73 ) . as mentioned before , this strong ferromagnetic contribution can be explained as a first - order perturbational effect .",
    "to generalize , the possibility of ferromagnetic coupling for nearest - neighbour impurities is open provided that the number of electrons in the system is odd .",
    "under such a condition , the nanoflake gains nonzero magnetic moment , which originates from the homo orbital .",
    "an additional condition is that the electronic density for the highest energy occupied orbital can not vanish at both impurity locations .",
    "the coupling is particularly enhanced when the electronic densities at the impurity sites are high and close to each other .",
    "then it appears straightforward to explain , that it is energetically favourable to have both impurity spins parallel , as the energy of such a configuration is significantly lowered by the first - order term .",
    "let us notice that in general , for a given weak contact potential @xmath27 , the ferromagnetic couplings , if present , are much stronger than the corresponding antiferromagnetic interactions , which can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : n161stlog ] .",
    "let us observe that the presence of a hubbard term with @xmath19 influences remarkably the interaction , especially for the case of charge neutrality , where it leads to strong enhancement of the af coupling , and eventually it is able to suppress totally any ferromagnetic behaviour for odd electron number , provided that the contact potential is strong enough .",
    "this tendency is observable for both nearest - neighbour impurities in the 1a and 1b positions .    for second - neighbour impurities ( results plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : n162nd ] ) , it is observed that the interaction for both 2a and 2b impurity locations [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : n16density](c ) ] is almost always ferromagnetic , regardless of the number of electrons , with an exception of @xmath91 .",
    "let us mention that the ferromagnetic coupling is expected for an infinite charge - neutral graphene when considering the impurities belonging to the same sublattice , which is the case for second neighbours ( e.g. ref .  ) .",
    "however , for the nanoflakes , pronounced differences emerge depending on the location of the impurity pair . in the case of the 2a location ,",
    "the coupling is much enhanced for an odd number of electrons ( which can be attributed to the same mechanism as that described for f coupling between nearest neighbours ; see the linear dependence of @xmath38 on @xmath27 in fig .",
    "[ fig : n162nd ] for @xmath72 ) . for even values of @xmath67",
    "the interaction energy is much weaker .",
    "the presence of the hubbard term with @xmath19 tends to build up the coupling .",
    "the interaction between impurities in the 2b position exhibits traces of vanishing electronic density of the orbital @xmath86 [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : n16density](b ) ] , in analogy to the situation met for the 1b pair . here",
    ", the interaction is strongly damped for @xmath92 , while for @xmath69 we observe enhanced f coupling owing to the mechanism mentioned earlier .",
    "what is quite interesting , @xmath91 converts the coupling into an antiferromagnetic one .    in order to comment on the influence of the hubbard term",
    ", we can conclude that its dominant result is to enhance the magnitude of the coupling . the hubbard term associated energy is lowered when the electronic densities for opposite - spin electrons tend to become unequal , hence acting in hand with the impurity potential in creating an imbalance in spin - up and spin - down electronic densities .",

    "[ fig : n18density](b ) that the degenerate orbital @xmath97 is characterized by a large electronic density on both 1a impurity sites . actually , breaking the symmetry of the nanoflake by introducing the magnetic impurities causes that it is most energetically favourable to have large electronic density at both sites of the 1a pair . what is interesting is that the linear dependence of @xmath38 on @xmath27 survives also for @xmath68 . here",

    ", the hubbard term strongly pushes the interaction toward antiferromagnetic for low @xmath67 .",
    "the rkky exchange integrals calculated for second - neighbour magnetic impurities [ in position 2a , 2b ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : n18density](c ) ] are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : n182nd ] . for 2a placement of the impurities ,",
    "the interaction is almost always ferromagnetic , but its magnitude is significantly enhanced for odd values of @xmath67 . for the 2b pair of impurities ,",
    "the coupling is particularly strong ( and ferromagnetic ) for @xmath101 , which can be attributed to the same mechanism as described previously in the case of the 1b pair .",
    "we have performed a tight - binding based study of rkky interaction in two graphene nanoflakes , different in their geometries but both containing four hexagonal rings .",
    "we focused on the influence of possible charge doping on the magnitude and sign of an indirect interaction .",
    "we also incorporated a hubbard term in the hamiltonian to estimate the effect of prototypic coulomb interaction .",
    "in general , we found a pronounced dependence of the rkky coupling integrals on the location of the pair of on - site magnetic moments in the nanostructure .    in relation to the odd number of charge carriers in the nanoflakes",
    ", we observed a specific contribution to indirect interaction , originating from the highest - energy electronic orbital occupied by a single electron and giving rise to nonzero spin distributed over the structure .",
    "this contribution is proportional to the magnitude of the contact potential @xmath27 and results from an uncompensated first - order correction to the orbital energy due to the presence of a pair of ferromagnetically polarized impurities .",
    "this mechanism , which may be regarded as somewhat similar to double exchange , always produces ferromagnetic contribution to indirect exchange and for sufficiently low @xmath27 it can dominate over the typical contribution proportional to @xmath79 originating from second - order perturbational correction to the energy ( being the clue of the ordinary rkky interaction ) .",
    "such a ferromagnetic contribution can either change the coupling sign from af to f for nearest - neighbour impurities or enhance the ferromagnetic coupling between second neighbours , as shown for two types of nanoflakes .",
    "the details of the mechanism depend also on the presence or absence of degeneracies in energy spectrum of the nanoflake",
    ".    the mechanism leading to the indirect ferromagnetic coupling linearly proportional to @xmath102 might be potentially useful , since it allows switching from af coupling characteristic of nearest - neighbour impurities for charge neutrality to f coupling by adding or removing a single electron from the nanoflake .",
    "especially advantageous conditions for such a situation occur for a triphenylene - like nanoflake for impurities in the 1a position .",
    "what is more , adding one or two further charge carriers does not alter the coupling sign in these particular situations .",
    "the influence of the hubbard term is mainly to enhance the magnitude of the coupling , as noted in ref .   for infinite graphene .",
    "unequal electronic densities for opposite - spin electrons lower the energy coming from the hubbard term , and the presence of the local spin - dependent impurity potential acts in the same direction .",
    "therefore , the hubbard term tends to increase the interaction energy in general . on the other hand , the presence of additional long - range repulsion between the electrons residing on different sites should qualitatively tend to compensate the effect of on - site repulsion .",
    "this effect could be captured in treating the @xmath16 parameter not necessarily as a true on - site energy , but rather in the spirit of the effective parameter ( as mentioned before , in connection with ref .  ) ) .",
    "sometimes other changes are detected , which can be attributed to the fact that the presence of the hubbard term itself causes some redistribution of the charge densities over lattice sites with respect to the case when the coulombic correlations are neglected .",
    "these changes also modify the indirect coupling .",
    "the application of the mfa approximation to the hubbard model appears justified for the ground state .",
    "@xcite however , development of the more accurate approaches ( albeit consuming less resources than exact diagonalization ) would be valuable with a view to the studies of temperature properties of the nanoflakes .",
    "the present calculations are performed for @xmath31 , exploiting ground - state properties of the system . however , in the ultrasmall , molecule - like structures , the separation of the discrete electronic energy levels is usually of the order of tenths of @xmath13 , where @xmath103 ev [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : n16density](c ) and [ fig : n18density](c ) ] .",
    "therefore , it appears that no significant redistribution of the charge carriers between the states can happen due to thermal excitations up to the temperatures of interest ( i.e. , room temperature ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the results for coupling energies appear valid also for nonzero temperatures .",
    "perhaps some finite temperature modifications can be expected in the presence of degenerate spectrum , as the impurity - induced energy splitting between the otherwise degenerate states is considerably small ( note the interesting thermodynamics of the undoped metallic - like nanoflakes with degenerate zero - energy states , discussed by ezawa ) .    in general , we find an immense influence of the electronic structure of the nanostructures on the properties of rkky interaction , being dependent on the wavefunctions of single orbitals , which are very strongly shaped by the nanoflake geometry .",
    "this distinguishes our case from the case of an infinite system , where propagating states are involved , and might open the door for designing the appropriate structures to guarantee the expected indirect coupling features .",
    "this work has been supported by polish ministry of science and higher education by a special purpose grant to fund the research and development activities and tasks associated with them , serving the development of young scientists and doctoral students ."
