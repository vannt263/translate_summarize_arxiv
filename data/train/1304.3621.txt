    "the time evolution of primordial magnetic fields from very early times to the present is a subject of continuing research ( for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "it has become of particular importance after the recent observational claim @xcite that a large fraction of the universe may be filled by a magnetic field .",
    "a volume - filling cosmic magnetic field is a natural prediction when magnetogenesis occurred in the early universe .",
    "it is thus of interest to have as precise as possible predictions on the evolution and possible magnitude of such fields .",
    "there has already been much effort put into this investigation @xcite .",
    "however , there is an important fundamental difficulty which needs to be overcome ; in particular , current numerical simulations do not reach the resolution required in order to reliably study magnetic fields over the large range of length scales and immense cosmic expansion factor between the early epoch of magnetogenesis and the recombination or present epoch .",
    "after all , the universe changes in size by a factor of @xmath4 between the electroweak and the recombination epoch , while the respective dynamical time scales differ by a factor of @xmath5 .",
    "only a small fraction of the initial magnetic energy survives dissipation - the exact amount may depend on the large scale tail of the magnetic field spectrum as has been seen to be the case for nonhelical fields .",
    "such tails are extremely difficult to deduce from numerical simulations .    though fairly detailed analytic estimates for the evolution of primordial magnetic fields exist @xcite , it may be of interest to verify them by more sophisticated methods .",
    "one such method is a closure theory of magnetohydrodynamics , which has been recently applied by us @xcite to nonhelical magnetic fields , with the important result that the field strength tail dependence on the scale @xmath6 of @xmath7 where @xmath8 ( cf .",
    "also @xcite ) seems to be essentially independent of the initial conditions in incompressible magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) where we assume freely decaying turbulence after the magnetogenesis epoch , which , however , is dominated by decay times at least of the order of the hubble time . here",
    "the tail is important as it has a large influence over how much magnetic energy survives .    in this paper",
    "we extend the formalism developed in @xcite to include helicity .",
    "helical magnetic fields have already attracted much prior attention @xcite as they may be much stronger due to an inverse cascade .    to do so this paper is structured as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : timehomoisohelmhd ] we give a short derivation of the time - evolution equations for a homogeneous and isotropic medium including all terms which appear due to a nonvanishing magnetic helicity and apply the findings to the situation in the early universe .",
    "more details can be found in appendix [ app : calc ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we then present our results of the time evolution of primordial magnetic fields according to our equations for different initial conditions and finally draw our conclusions in sec .  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "for an incompressible fluid ( i.e. , @xmath9 ) the equations for the time evolution of the two main observables of magnetohydrodynamics , the velocity field of the turbulent medium @xmath10 and the magnetic field @xmath11 , are given by @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively . here",
    "@xmath14 is the conductivity ( which is assumed to be very large in the following ) and @xmath15 the mass density of the fluid , while @xmath16 is some viscous density force .",
    "note that for most part of the evolution of the early universe , incompressibility is an excellent assumption due to the large speed of sound in the relativistic plasma .",
    "our main interest lies in the average buildup of magnetic and kinetic energy density , respectively , as well as of the magnetic helicity taken over an ensemble of cosmic realizations ( denoted by chevrons @xmath17 ) , i.e. , @xmath18 with @xmath19 being the magnetic spectral energy density defined through @xmath20 @xmath21 the kinetic spectral energy density given by @xmath22 and @xmath23 the magnetic helicity density , i.e. , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the magnetic vector potential and @xmath26 is the total magnetic helicity density , and where @xmath27 , i.e. , coulomb gauge , has been assumed .    for all expressions",

    "it is important to note here that whereas the ideal mhd equations conserve energy and helicity , in any real application to astrophysics and cosmology dissipation plays an important role . in particular , the early universe is described by a large prandtl number  @xcite , a measure of the relative importance of kinetic dissipation versus magnetic diffusion .",
    "dissipation is thus dominated by shear viscosity , such that magnetic diffusion can be neglected . since",
    "energy dissipates by either kinetic or magnetic dissipation , but helicity only by magnetic dissipation , in the early universe helicity is essentially conserved whereas energy is not . to model this in our simulations",
    "we introduce a viscosity term into eq .",
    "( [ dtuqh ] ) .",
    "in addition it should be pointed out that the result obtained in @xcite is consistent with the equations presented here as it can be seen that for vanishing initial magnetic helicity , it will be zero for all times and therefore simply the third term in ( [ dtmqh ] ) and the last term in ( [ dtuqh ] ) have to be dropped .    in order to study the time evolution of magnetic fields in the early universe",
    ", we include expansion accounted by the scale factor @xmath2 with @xmath46 at the initial magnetogensis epoch . in section iii of ref .",

    "@xcite , it was shown that eqs .",

    "( [ dtmqh])-([dthqh ] ) are replaced by their comoving analogues .",
    "these comoving quantities ( marked by a `` @xmath49 '' ) are related to the physical ones by @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , whereas @xmath57 is the hubble constant at the initial epoch . in the following the index",
    "`` @xmath49 '' is dropped , and all quantities are meant to be the comoving ones unless noted otherwise .",
    "it is now possible to analyze the time development of both the spectral magnetic and kinetic energy as well as the spectral helicity by numerically integrating the cosmic version of eqs .",
    "( [ dtmqh])-([dthqh ] ) . in comparison to the results without helicity @xcite",
    ", it may be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : timeevolution ] that the absolute value and location of the integral scale ( i.e. , the scale at which the peak of the spectral energy is located ) changes dramatically since , due to an inverse cascade , large amounts of energy are transferred to small @xmath39 . on the other hand",
    ", the scaling of the large - scale tail with the wave number stays the same , i.e. , we still have @xmath58 and , in addition , we find @xmath59 as well .",
    "in contrast to the nonhelical case , however , the slope of the large - scale tail is much less important in the maximally helical case .",
    "the evolution of magnetic energy density and correlation length is determined solely by the requirement of helicity conservation , and not by the tail . in the following we present analytical arguments to explain these results .      as in the case for nonhelical fields  @xcite , the nonvanishing term with lowest power in the taylor expansion in @xmath60 of eqs .",
    "( [ dtmqh])-([dthqh ] ) is of fourth order for large scales , so that for helical fields as well , we have @xmath61 and @xmath62 on large scales .",
    "this result is also confirmed by simulation as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : timeevolution ] .",
    "however , in contrast to nonhelical fields , in the fully helical field case , equipartition , i.e. , @xmath63 on all scales , does not hold anymore .",
    "rather it is @xmath63 only on small scales with @xmath64 on the integral scale , an effect also observed in ref .",
    "@xcite .             as it will be shown in the following , the main effect of nonvanishing initial helicity is the dramatic change of the time evolution of the integral scale and the corresponding values of the important quantities .",
    "first , we give a short summary of the time evolution of the magnetic spectral energy with vanishing initial helicity .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that in this case , if the spectral energy has a slope proportional to @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) for @xmath67 , i.e. , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a normalization constant given by the value of @xmath70 at @xmath71 , we have @xmath72 for the time - dependent integral scale in the early radiation dominated universe ( i.e. , @xmath73 ) , with @xmath74 being determined by @xcite @xmath75 where @xmath76 .",
    "since all the initial magnetic field has been dissipated away for @xmath77 , the magnetic field left over at scale factor @xmath2 is simply given by eq .",
    "( [ kint ] ) inserted into eq .",
    "( [ qslope ] ) , such that we find @xmath78    if , however , the initial helicity is not vanishing , it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : ki ] that it only has an influence on the magnetic and kinetic spectral energies if at the integral scale it has a value which is close to the maximal spectral helicity value @xmath79 given by @xmath80 however , the magnetic spectral energy decays faster than the spectral helicity in the early universe , and therefore even by starting with a rather small initial helicity it is inevitable that after some time it obtains its largest possible value given by eq .",
    "( [ hmax ] ) . therefore , there are two successive regimes in the time evolution - the first ( referred to by `` 1 '' in the following ) where the effect of helicity is negligible and the second ( referred to by `` 2 '' ) where helicity has its maximal value and dominates the time evolution .    one can estimate the time it takes for some initial conditions to evolve to the point where a transition from regime 1 to regime 2 takes place . here",
    "we will focus on the magnetic spectral energy as it is the important observable in our case .",
    "we are starting with some initial conditions where for @xmath81 we have @xmath82 such that @xmath83 corresponds to maximal initial helicity and @xmath84 means no initial helicity at all , i.e. , @xmath85 . if we now assume that , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : kiei ] , the time evolution for both has a power law dependence on the scale factor @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath86 where , as motivated above , @xmath87 , and we can estimate the scale factor @xmath88 of the transition from regime 1 to regime 2 by solving the condition @xmath89 , i.e. , @xmath90 for @xmath2 which gives @xmath91 from this we can , therefore , derive a lower bound on @xmath92 , such that for all @xmath92 larger than this lower bound @xmath93 , the field has become maximally helical by recombination at scale factor @xmath94 , @xmath95 here the epoch of recombination is relevant , rather than the present , since , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , during matter domination after the epoch of recombination only negligible further processing of the magnetic fields occurs , provided the magnetic fields are sufficiently strong .",
    "taking the values which have been obtained , i.e. , @xmath96 for @xmath97 and @xmath98 , for @xmath99 ( implying magnetogenesis during the qcd epoch at @xmath100mev ) we therefore get @xmath101 .",
    "this implies that even the smallest initial helicities ultimately have an effect on the time evolution of the fields .",
    "furthermore , also the integral scale itself changes its dependence on the scale factor when entering the maximally helical regime 2 , i.e. , @xmath102 in regime 1 , where , according to ( [ kint ] ) , we have @xmath103 , matching well the numerically found value , and @xmath104 in regime 2 , where we have numerically obtained @xmath105 and @xmath106 .    the values @xmath107 and @xmath108 , as well as @xmath109 , may be deduced unambiguously by the argument of helicity conservation @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the integral scale and we have assumed that this scale carries the bulk of the helicity . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : helicity ] ) and ( [ kint ] ) one finds immediately @xmath112 for @xmath8 , to be compared to the numerically found @xmath113 .",
    "the values of @xmath114 and @xmath108 are obtained by considering the turbulent cascading of energy from the integral scale to the dissipation scale .",
    "this process will decrease @xmath115 and will increase @xmath116 .",
    "how fast this can happen is determined by the requirement that an eddy turnover can take place on scale @xmath116 at epoch with scale factor @xmath2  @xcite , in particular @xmath117 it needs to be stressed here that the above is a condition to be formulated with physical quantities as opposed to comoving ones .",
    "since we have dropped throughout the index `` @xmath49 '' , i.e. , all quantities in the above equations are comoving , additional powers of the scale factors @xmath2 enter through @xmath118 and @xmath119 ( note that @xmath120 ) . using these equations we find @xmath121 for the evolution of comoving integral scale and magnetic field , or equivalently , @xmath122 such that @xmath123 and @xmath124 , which are in extremely good agreement with the numerical simulations . to summarize the time evolution we may write @xmath125 with @xmath103 and @xmath126 and @xmath127 with @xmath128 and @xmath129 , where @xmath88 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : atr ] ) with @xmath130 and @xmath131 for the initial conditions given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : initial ] ) .          with these arguments at hand one can now estimate the strength of the magnetic field , which , compared to the case without magnetic helicity , is larger . in order to make a reasonable estimate ,",
    "it is important to take into account the time evolution of both the integral scale @xmath132 and the corresponding spectral magnetic energy @xmath70 in the two different regimes introduced in sec .  [",

    "this case would correspond to @xmath136 . if we now acknowledge the integral scale to be the coherence scale of the magnetic field , then for the magnetic field strength at @xmath111 we get @xmath137 using eq .",
    "( [ kimia ] ) we may then finally estimate the magnitude of the present day magnetic field depending on its initial value and the helicity , @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the initial alfvn velocity at magnetogenesis , i.e. , @xmath140 , and where we have assumed the preferred exponent @xmath8 .",
    "the surviving magnetic field strength is enhanced in the helical case by @xmath141 over that in the nonhelical case , which amounts to a factor @xmath142 and @xmath143 for magnetogenesis during the qcd and electroweak epoch , respectively , highlighting the importance of helicity .",
    "the detailed prediction for the present magnetic field strength as a function of the initial magnetic field strength and helicity is shown in fig .",

    "the resulting ordinary differential equations were subsequently numerically integrated to predict the evolution of helical cosmic magnetic fields from the early universe to the present .",
    "we find that the energy content and coherence length of submaximally helical magnetic fields essentially evolve as those of magnetic fields in the completely nonhelical case .",
    "due to the long cosmic expansion from the early universe to the present , however , even magnetic fields with the smallest initial helicities ultimately become maximally helical before the present epoch , thereafter decaying slower than nonhelical magnetic fields due to an inverse cascade .",
