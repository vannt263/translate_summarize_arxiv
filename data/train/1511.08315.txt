    "an adiabatic cyclic process involves slowly changing periodic parameters driving a physical system . in the absence of transitions the system returns to its initial state after the cycle .",
    "however , the quantum state may acquire a phase factor in this process that can be written in general as the sum of a dynamical phase that depends on the hamiltonian and an extra term of geometrical origin .",
    "the latter is known as the berry phase and can be calculated from the geometric properties of the path described by the driving parameters in the parameter space of the hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "nonadiabatic cyclic processes may also give rise to geometric phases that are smaller than adiabatic berry phases but with similar geometric characteristics  @xcite .",

    "geometric phases and related topological effects are also ubiquitous in molecular physics .",
    "for example , they play a crucial role when the born - oppenheimer approximation breaks down near a conical intersection of two potential energy surfaces . in these cases ,",

    "hence , they can be controlled via deformation of this path .",

    "spin transport calculations predict that such a transition in the field topology causes a distinct shift in the interference pattern of the conductance in loop - shaped spin - interferometers  @xcite .",
    "however , due to complex nonadiabatic spin dynamics , the topological transition is associated with an emergent _ effective _ geometric phase  @xcite and not with the bare geometric phase that can be calculated from the solid angle that the spin subtends in a roundtrip around the circuit .",
    "recently , berry phases have also been extracted using interferometry in superconducting qubit systems  @xcite . indeed , a topological transition in such spin-@xmath2 superconducting qubit systems has been observed by measuring the chern number , a topological invariant that counts the number of degenerate energy eigenvalues inside a closed manifold along which",

    "we study the nonadiabatic dynamics of a classical and a quantum mechanical ( spin ) magnetic moment precessing in a time - dependent magnetic field with varying topology due to the combined action of coplanar , homogeneous and rotating , field components .",
    "u(1 ) phases do not play any role in the classical dynamics ( in contrast to the quantum case ) but the lie algebras of the group su(2 ) of spin rotations and so(3 ) of classical rotations are isomorphic leading to analogous phenomena .",
