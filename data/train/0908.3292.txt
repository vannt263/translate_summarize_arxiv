    "we can still observe the divergent behavior of mfpts for @xmath66 and a non monotonic behavior for @xmath67 , with @xmath68 . by increasing the value of the correlation time ( @xmath69 )",

    "the nes region is the area where enhanced stability of a metastable state is observed . in other words",

    "the asymmetry of the potential profile with respect to the @xmath75 coordinate makes more effective the correlation of the noise for brownian particles moving from left to right .",
    "this means that , at very low noise intensities of the colored noise , the particles inside the potential well will escape more easily with respect to the white noise case .",
    "therefore , the trapping effect , which is responsible for the divergent behavior for any initial unstable state within the range @xmath76 will happen in a restricted range of initial positions , that is @xmath77 with @xmath78 .",

    "this means that the simulation data obtained for @xmath50 underestimate the real data in the divergent dynamical regime .",
    "in fact if we prolong the maximum simulation time @xmath48 we obtain more approximate values for @xmath23 and @xmath79 and the divergent behavior will be visible at lower noise intensities . as a consequence @xmath80 will be shifted towards lower values .    for high values of the noise intensity",
    "all the plots show a monotonic decrease behavior as a function of noise intensity collapsing in a unique curve .",
    "moreover the slope of this limit curve becomes flatter by increasing the correlation time .",
    "this means that the nes effect involves more and more orders of magnitude of the noise intensity .",
    "the effect of the colored noise is therefore to delay the escape process or in other words to enhance more and more the stability of the metastable state for increasing values of the noise intensity .    in fig .",

    "this ratio reveals a nonmonotonic behavior with a minimum , demonstrating the existence of a noise intensity for which the width of the first passage time distribution is the minimum related to its mean . in other words this value corresponds to a maximum of precision in the measure of @xmath23 .",

    "this trend to the disappearance of the minimum in the curves of @xmath1 , corresponds to the restricted range of the initial positions for which we observe a divergent behavior of @xmath23 , that is to the trend of disappearance of this divergent behavior .",
