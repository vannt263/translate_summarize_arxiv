    "persistent homology has become a popular tool in the study of point cloud data sets . given such a set @xmath0 , one may attempt to approximate the topology of @xmath0 by first placing @xmath1-balls around each point ( call the union of the balls @xmath2 ) , and then allowing @xmath1 to grow .",
    "this yields a nested sequence of spaces @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and one may compute the homology of these spaces . for @xmath1 small , not much happens since @xmath2 is simply a disjoint union of balls , but as @xmath1 increases the balls begin to overlap and nontrivial cycles may appear .",
    "one may then measure how long such cycles  persist \" ; that is , a cycle may appear in @xmath2 and be filled in by a boundary in some @xmath5 , @xmath6 . if the difference @xmath7 is large relative to @xmath1 then one may deduce that the cycle is a real topological feature of the set @xmath0 . for interesting applications of these ideas see , for example , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the abstraction of this idea is the notion of a filtered space . given a space @xmath0 , which in this paper will always be a simplicial complex , we take an increasing sequence of subcomplexes @xmath8 let @xmath9 be a field .",
    "we then obtain , for @xmath10 , a sequence of @xmath9-vector spaces @xmath11 and we may observe how long a homology class persists in this sequence .",
    "this is encapsulated neatly by carlsson and zomorodian @xcite in the following way .",

    "this is a set of intervals",
    "@xmath19 , @xmath20 $ ] that show how long homology classes persist , the infinite intervals corresponding to classes that live in @xmath21 .    in applications , however , one may need to consider multiple filtration directions .",
    "for example , the data set in question may have a natural filtration of its own ( e.g. , by density ) , and then we obtain another filtration direction by growing @xmath1-balls .",
    "these _ multifiltrations _ are much more complicated , and the complete classification of @xcite has no analogue .",
    "indeed , in @xcite , the authors show that for multifiltrations there is no complete discrete invariant analogous to the barcode .",
    "there are some discrete invariants , but there is also a continuous piece obtained as a quotient of an algebraic variety , @xmath22 .",
    "this is summarized in section [ variety ] below .",
    "the main idea in @xcite is to considered spaces @xmath0 filtered by @xmath23 for @xmath24 . for a fixed @xmath10 ,",
    "one then obtains a @xmath25$]-module @xmath26 just as in the @xmath27 case .",
    "modules over @xmath28 $ ] , @xmath29 , do not admit a neat classification , however , and that is where the trouble lies .",
    "the authors consider two multisets @xmath30 and @xmath31 which indicate the degrees in @xmath32 where homology classes are born and where they die , respectively .",
    "the problem is that there may be many ( even uncountably many ) nonisomorphic modules with the same @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "these are parametrized bye the quotient of the variety @xmath22 by the action of an algebraic group . in the case",
    "@xmath27 , this quotient space is always finite ( see theorem [ onevar ] below ) , as one would expect given the classification of these modules discussed above .",
    "the multisets @xmath30 and @xmath31 consist of the elements in @xmath32 where the module @xmath18 has generators and relations , respectively .",
    "these are obtained by computing the modules @xmath33 and @xmath34 . when @xmath27 , these are the only nontrivial tor groups , but for @xmath29 , there may be more .",
    "these higher tor modules are the main objects of study in this paper . for @xmath10 ,",
    "let @xmath35 be the multiset of elements in @xmath32 where generators of @xmath36 occur .",
    "hilbert s syzygy theorem implies that @xmath37 for @xmath38 and so we obtain a finite family of discrete invariants , @xmath39 . using these",
    ", we may partition the set @xmath22 of @xcite into subsets @xmath40 consisting of those modules @xmath18 having @xmath41 .",

    "this group acts on the various @xmath40 and we have the following result .",
    "* theorem 4.3 * _ there is a projective variety @xmath45 and a map @xmath46 _    often , the map @xmath47 is injective and we may use it to give the quotient set the structure of an algebraic variety . in turn , this yields a variety structure on the full quotient @xmath48 by taking the disjoint union over the possible @xmath49 . morally , this is what one wants .",
    "however , this is _ not _ the quotient space obtained by viewing @xmath22 as a variety and then taking the quotient by @xmath44 .",
    "the difference in our approach is that we have lost information about certain degeneracies among the elements of @xmath22 at the expense of gaining a variety structure on the quotient .",
    "an example of this is given in section [ czex ] .",
    "it may happen , however , that some @xmath47 is not injective .",
    "this may occur , for example , if there are generators for @xmath18 that are not co - located and the relations lie in unfortunate locations .",
    "we provide a remedy for this in section [ different ] . for an example , see section [ containment ] .",
    "the remainder of the paper explores geometric interpretations of the @xmath50 , @xmath51 . to do this ,",

    "let @xmath52 be a complex filtered by @xmath32 and for each @xmath10 , denote by @xmath53 the @xmath43-module of @xmath54-chains on @xmath52 : @xmath55 .",
    "we then have a chain complex @xmath56 in the category of graded @xmath43-modules and the associated hypertor modules @xmath57 . by examining the spectral sequences that compute these modules , we obtain a natural map @xmath58",
    "this gives us a geometric interpretation of @xmath59 : elements in @xmath60 possibly correspond to locations of generators of @xmath61 . in theorem",
    "[ tor0tor2 ] , we describe the kernel and image of this map .",
    "the higher differentials in this spectral sequence provide a mechanism to relate elements of @xmath62 to elements of @xmath63 .",
    "we shall not investigate these more subtle relationships here .    in the final section , we use the other spectral sequence to obtain an interpretation of the hypertor modules @xmath57 .",
    "if the filtration is such that at most one simplex gets added at a time as we move from one degree to another adjacent to it , then we have ( theorem [ hypertor ] ) @xmath64 elements on the right hand side may be thought of as  virtual \" @xmath65-cells that fill in duplicated relations among cells of lower dimension .",
    "we also show that , by dropping the grading in the vector spaces @xmath66 , we may define a boundary operator @xmath67 so that the homology of the resulting complex recovers @xmath68",
    ". examples are discussed .",
    "finally , we note that there may be a relationship between the @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and the rank invariant of @xcite .",
