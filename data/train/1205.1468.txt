    "matrix models have been proposed as candidates for nonperturbative formulation of the string theory @xcite .",
    "the iib matrix model @xcite is one of those models .",
    "while the space - time coordinates are represented by matrices in its original proposal , the matrices are interpreted as a covariant derivative in the alternative interpretation , which we call the derivative interpretation @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the matrices are identified with momenta and it may be t - dual to the original proposal , although it is an open problem to realize the t - duality in the matrix model .",
    "the advantage of the derivative interpretation is that the diffeomorphism invariance is manifest and arbitrary manifolds are described by matrices , which enables one to study the structure of the gravity in the model from an alternative point of view .",
    "more concretely , an arbitrary @xmath7-dimensional manifold @xmath8 with @xmath9 is described by the matrices as follows .",
    "first we regard the matrices as linear operators acting on @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the principal @xmath12-bundle over @xmath8 . the space @xmath13 is equivalent to the space of the global section @xmath14 . here",
    "@xmath15 is the vector bundle over @xmath8 , whose fiber is the space of the regular representation",
    ". then we identify @xmath7 matrices out of ten bosonic matrices with the covariant derivative on @xmath15 , and the rest @xmath16 matrices with 0 .",
    "the fluctuation around this background includes infinitely many particles with various spins .",
    "furthermore , the equations of motion for the background agree with the einstein equation , and the diffeomorphism and the local lorentz symmetry are included in the @xmath17 symmetry of the model .",
    "the interpretation was applied to a supermatrix model which is an extension of the iib matrix model , where the local supersymmetry is manifest and the supermatrices are identified with a supercovariant derivative so that the model is expected to describe supergravity @xcite .",
    "it was also shown that the interpretation allows the model to describe the dilaton and the kalb - ramond @xmath18-field if the torsion is introduced @xcite .",
    "the quantum effects in the derivative interpretation have not been well understood . in this paper , we study the low - energy effective action .",
    "we find that the effective action is a sum of terms , each of which is factorized into a product of diffeomorphism invariant action functionals : @xmath19 here @xmath1 is a space - time integral of a scalar local operator @xmath3 : @xmath20 this is also true for the background consisting of block diagonal matrices .",
    "the manifold described by such a background consists of some number of universes , each of which is described by a diagonal block .",
    "it was shown by coleman over twenty years ago that , in the euclidean quantum gravity , the effective action on a multiverse takes this form due to the effect of wormholes that connect the universes @xcite .",
    "thus the above effective action of the iib matrix model is interpreted as describing the multiverse .",
    "the integral over the fluctuation of the matrices corresponds to the effects of the wormholes .",

    "we have a similar structure for @xmath224 . note that indices related to @xmath33 and @xmath34 and those to @xmath157 and @xmath145 form a singlet independently .",
    "this is because the taylor expansion and the change of variables do not mix @xmath33 and @xmath34 to @xmath157 and @xmath145 .    in order to examine the integration for the relative coordinates and fiber coordinates",
    ", we consider two independent lorentz transformations , @xmath225 and @xmath226 where @xmath227 .",
    "the indices in @xmath228 that appear in come from @xmath218 , @xmath221 , @xmath229 , or @xmath222 . under",

    "similarly , the indices in @xmath230 transform properly under . under the transformations ( [ lorentz transformation 1 ] ) and ( [ lorentz transformation 2 ] ) , the integral measure in ( [ n - vertex loop 2 ] ) and @xmath207 is invariant as is seen from .",
    "hence , in , the integrations over @xmath231 , @xmath183 , @xmath232 and @xmath233 yield an @xmath234 invariant tensor . the indices in @xmath228 form a singlet and",
    "those in @xmath230 form another singlet .",
    "then , all the indices in @xmath235 are contracted to a singlet among themselves , and similarly for @xmath92 .",
    "thus , ( [ n - vertex loop 2 ] ) results in the form @xmath236 where each factor is a scalar differential polynomial of the background fields .",
    "the effective action is invariant under the @xmath17 transformation for the background fields which includes the diffeomorphism and the local lorentz symmetry .",
    "hence , by summing the above products of the lorentz scalars in ( [ product ] ) , we obtain , as the total one - loop contribution to the effective action , @xmath237 where @xmath1 s are diffeomorphism and local lorentz invariant action functionals , and @xmath238 are certain constants .",
    "thus we have proved the factorization at the one - loop level .    for the higher order contributions , we merely need to consider the cubic and quartic interaction terms in @xmath137 .",
    "however the argument proceeds completely parallel to the one - loop case , and the effective action becomes a product of local actions , each of which comes from each index loop .",
    "hence , we can show that the factorization occurs to all orders and the effective action takes the form @xmath239 the degree of each term in @xmath1 is equal to the number of index loops .",
    "therefore , the higher order diagrams give the higher - degree polynomials of @xmath1 .",
    "in this paper , we proved the factorization of the effective action in the derivative interpretation of the iib matrix model .",
    "the point of the proof is that there is the translational invariance on every patch and that the tensor indices form singlets on each index loop due to the integral over the fiber coordinates .",
    "each diagonal block in the classical solution is considered to represent a different universe .",
    "the factorization implies that the universes interact each other by the products of action functionals .",
    "it is also known that , in the ordinary theory of quantum gravity , the effective action on the multiverse takes such a factorized form due to the wormholes , which are quantum fluctuation of the space - time .",
    "it is expected that the form of the effective action is universal to the wide class of theories that contain quantum gravity .",
    "although the action of this type is not local , it does not cause a violation of causality . actually , an observer sitting in a universe finds that the nature is described by an ordinary local field theory .",
    "the reason is as follows .",
    "the path - integral based on the action can be rewritten as @xmath240 where @xmath241 is a function of the coupling constants @xmath242 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath243 s are fixed to some values by some mechanism , the observer in a universe merely sees a local theory given by @xmath244 although this type of action has been discussed from various points of view @xcite , it seems that there is no definite understanding so far . in particular , it is interesting to see whether the values of @xmath243 s depend on the initial conditions or are fixed dynamically to some special values .",
    "if it is the latter case , we may construct a model which describes the real world with realistic parameters .",
    "for example , referring to the works @xcite , we can show that the particle content in the standard model is realized around classical solutions in the derivative interpretation of the iib matrix model , and it would be interesting if all the coupling constants are fixed by such mechanism .",

    "in this appendix , we give an example of the calculation of the effective action at the one - loop level .    here",

    "this diagram is calculated as follows : @xmath247 where @xmath248 is given by .",
    "the action of @xmath249 on @xmath207 can be evaluated as @xmath250    as in and , we change the variables for @xmath251 , and obtain the chain rules .",
    "the integrations over the fiber coordinates @xmath252 and @xmath253 and @xmath254 and @xmath255 are trivially performed because there is no @xmath54 inserted , and we have a constant factor @xmath256 . here @xmath257 is a divergent constant that represents the value of the delta function when the two points coincide : @xmath258 . then , making the taylor expansion , we obtain @xmath259 where @xmath260 , @xmath261 , and @xmath262 and @xmath263 are defined by @xmath264 @xmath205-dependence in the integrand appears only in the product of the delta functions . since one of the four delta functions in is dependent on the others , it is proportional to @xmath265",
    "since the product of the second to the fifth line in is invariant under two independent lorentz transformations ( and ) , it forms a @xmath234 invariant tensor .",
    "because it is proportional to @xmath265 , as we have seen , it can be written as @xmath266 therefore turns out to be @xmath267 which is apparently factorized .",
    "in order for the model to be realistic , there must be massless spin - one and spin - two fields ( gauge fields and gravitons ) .",
    "we assume that the higher spin fields are massive , so that we do not have to consider the mixing of spin - one or spin - two fields to them .",
    "first , we consider the spin - one vector @xmath245 .",
    "the mass term of @xmath245 in the one - loop effective action is depicted in figure [ fig : bmass ] , where we have two insertions of @xmath245 s in the index loop specified by @xmath161 and no insertions in the other index loop specified by @xmath162 .",
    "the sum of the diagrams is given by @xmath268 where @xmath269 is the volume of @xmath8 , and @xmath270 is the volume of the fiber @xmath12 .",
    "since the integrations over @xmath33 and @xmath157 are completely decoupled , ( [ 2ptb ] ) is reduced to the result in the ordinary scalar quantum electrodynamics . while the @xmath271 term in the taylor series gives the one - loop corrections to the maxwell term , the @xmath272 term is the mass term , which vanishes due to the gauge invariance .    in a similar way",
    ", we can calculate the two - point function of the spin - two gravitational field @xmath273 .",
    "the result for @xmath273 is also reduced to that in the ordinary quantum field theory . however",
    ", this is a little nontrivial because @xmath273 associates a derivative , which acts also on the delta functions @xmath274 in the propagators .",

    "these terms do not correspond to the ordinary field theory of @xmath273 .",

    "in the second class , one derivative acts on @xmath32 and the other on the delta function . these terms vanish because of the @xmath277-integration . in the third class ,",
