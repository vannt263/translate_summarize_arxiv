    "whenever we compute an asteroid s orbit , it comes with an uncertainty region due to the limited accuracy of the available observations . in other words ,",
    "orbits are only known in a statistical sense and the accuracy of the related probabilistic interpretation relies heavily on the observation accuracy and error modeling .",
    "therefore , it is important to apply an appropriate statistical treatment to the observations used to compute the orbit .",
    "the vast majority of asteroid astrometry is given by optical observations , i.e. , each observation provides two angular measurements , typically right ascension ( ra ) and declination ( dec ) in the equatorial reference frame j2000 , describing the position of an asteroid on the celestial sphere at a specified time . such measurements are obtained with respect to nearby reference stars , whose positions are provided by a reference star catalog . in general , the more accurate the star catalog , the more accurate the observation .    despite the common assumption that observation errors have zero mean , @xcite show that asteroid astrometry is significantly biased and suggest the reason is the presence of systematic errors in the star catalogs used to reduce the astrometry .",
    "@xcite computed star catalog systematic errors for usno - a1.0 @xcite , usno - a2.0 @xcite , usno - b1.0 @xcite , ucac2 @xcite , and tycho-2 @xcite by comparing each of these catalogs to 2mass @xcite . despite the lack of proper motions ,",
    "2mass was chosen as the reference catalog because of its very accurate star positions at epoch j2000.0 and high spatial density .",
    "@xcite showed that correcting asteroid astrometry using their computed biases leads to significantly lower systematic errors and statistically better ephemeris predictions .",
    "pan - starrs ps1 @xcite is one of the most accurate asteroid surveys with an astrometric quality of the order of 0.1  .",
    "although this survey uses 2mass as reference catalog for the astrometric reduction , @xcite found that pan - starrs ps1 data have surprisingly high biases on the order of 0.050.1  with a strong regional dependence .",
    "@xcite show that the lack of proper motion in 2mass is likely to be the cause of the pan - starrs ps1 astrometry systematic errors and signatures .",
    "moreover , they suggest that ppmxl @xcite be used as reference catalog because of its spatial density , accuracy comparable to that of 2mass , and availability of proper motion information .    since the lack of proper motion can be significant for high quality observations , in this paper we describe how to correct asteroid observations for both position and proper motion errors .",
    "moreover , we perform this analysis for a more comprehensive list of star catalogs than that considered in @xcite .",
    "as of january 2014 more than 600,000 asteroids have been designated , @xmath060% of which are numbered . the number of asteroid optical observations is already larger than 100,000,000 and increases every day .",
    "observers submit their observations to the minor planet center ( mpc ) and usually provide information on the catalog used to perform the astrometric reduction .",
    "the mpc in turn makes the catalog information publicly available by using an alphabetical flag .",
    "table  [ t : catalogs ] shows the mpc flag , the number of stars , and the number of asteroid observations different catalogs .",
    "we only consider the catalogs for which the number of asteroid observations reported to the mpc with the corresponding catalog flag was larger than 40,000 as of january 2014 .",
    "we also included the gsc-1.2 @xcite catalog to complete the gsc-1 catalog series .",
    "the most used catalog is usno - a2.0 , with more than 40,000,000 asteroid observations .",
    "2mass , which was used as the reference catalog by @xcite , is the fourth most used catalog and the related astrometry is dominated by pan - starrs ps1 observations ( more than 75% of the sample ) .",
    "observations reported with code ` z ' were reduced with one of the gsc catalogs , but we do not know which one .",
    ".star catalogs and mpc flags .",
    "the number of asteroid observations for each catalog account for all the astrometry available up to january 7 , 2014 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite show that asteroid astrometric errors can be correlated , especially for same - station observations closely spaced in time .",
    "the presence of correlations is not a surprise since still unresolved systematic errors , such as timing errors , result in correlations . to mitigate the effect of unresolved systematic errors and correlations",
    "we relax the weights , especially when there are many observations from the same station on the same night ( which we call a batch of observations ) .",
    "our strategy is to apply a scale factor @xmath1 to each weight , where @xmath2 is the number of observations contained in a single - station batch .",
    "we consider as a batch a sequence of observations from the same station with a time gap smaller than 8 hours between two consecutive observations . for ccd observations , which have a typical batch of 35 observations ,",
    "this scale factor is close to the safety factor of 2 suggested by @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 better handles the cases with a large number of observations in a batch and avoids down - weighting batches with a lower number of observations .",
    "moreover , this scale factor is applied to all types of observations thus mitigating possible correlations for , e.g. , old photographic observations .    to validate the new weighting scheme we performed a test similar to that of sec .  [ s : pred_test ] . in this case",
    "we used two different weighting schemes : the one with a safety factor of 2 and the one that scales by @xmath1 .",
    "figure  [ f : predw_test ] shows the prediction error cumulative distributions for both schemes .",
    "the two weighting schemes give very similar results and they both appear to be coarse as they give uncertainties larger than theoretically expected .",
    "a deeper analysis of the data weights is beyond the scope of this paper , but we plan to address this issue in the future .     for different weighting schemes .",
    "solid line is with the @xmath3 factor , dashed line is with the safety factor of 2 , and dash - dotted line is a normal cumulative distribution .",
    "the titles indicate what apparitions were used to compute the prediction , e.g. , app .",
    "13 means that apparition 1 , 2 , and 3 were used.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]",
    "developing a reliable statistical error model for asteroid astrometric observations is a complicated task . in this paper",
    "we give a significant contribution by computing star position and proper motion corrections .",
    "the selection of a reference star catalog was not obvious .",
    "we selected the subset of ppmxl corresponding to 2mass based stars , therefore inheriting the good accuracy of 2mass stars and adding proper motion information .",
    "we decided not to use the whole ppmxl catalog because more than 50% of its star positions are derived from usno - b1.0 and are not as accurate as desirable .",
    "the usno - b1.0 based stars in ppmxl can also affect asteroid observations reduced with ppmxl .",
    "these observations can not be corrected unless we select a reference catalog independent from ppmxl .",
    "a possible solution would be that observers select 2mass based stars from ppmxl .",
    "however , this approach would result in an inhomogeneous dataset of ppmxl based astrometry , unless the corresponding observations are flagged with a separate mpc catalog code .",
    "@xcite question the reliability of proper motions in some of the main astrometric catalogs , including ppmxl .",
    "although we acknowledge that this problem has to be fixed , our goal is to improve the current treatment of asteroid astrometry .",
    "the tests discussed in this paper show that including our position and proper motion corrections provide better predictions and better orbital fit statistics .",
    "as soon as the gaia star catalog @xcite is available , we will have a much more reliable reference catalog to refine our debiasing scheme .",
    "finally , we presented a data weight scheme to update and somehow generalize that suggested by @xcite .",
    "in particular , to properly mitigate the possible effect of correlated observation errors , we now account for the number of observations present in a single batch and scale the data weights accordingly .",
    "since this scheme still is quite coarse , future work will include a detailed statistical analysis of the observation errors to produce a more accurate data weighting scheme .",
    "we are grateful to d.  g. monet and m. micheli for several discussions that helped in improving the paper .",
    "we also thank b.  j. gray ,  .",
