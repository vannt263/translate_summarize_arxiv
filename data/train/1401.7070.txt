    "in this work we have performed analytical and numerical analysis of the effect of linear losses on spontaneous parametric down - conversion in quadratic nonlinear waveguide and waveguide arrays , considering in detail biphoton and single - photon outputs under a variety of conditions .",
    "we have shown that idler losses can lead to increase of signal intensity and stabilisation of signal output in relation to the waveguide length .",
    "we have also demonstrated that signal and idler losses lead to the transformation of common sinc - shaped photon - pair correlation spectrum into a lorenzian shape , and that this transformation can be fully reversed by specific increase in pump losses .",
    "finally we have shown that nonlinear waveguide arrays can serve as a robust integrated platform for the generation of entangled photon states with non - classical spatial correlations , and that the operation of such quantum circuit is tolerant even to relatively high losses .",
    "we expect that this work will open new opportunities in developing loss - tolerant quantum integrated circuits .",
    "the work has been supported by the australian research council , including discovery project dp130100135 and future fellowship ft100100160 .",
