    "while the standard model provides methods of making some calculations to an impressive degree of precision , there are still many areas where first - principles calculations must be supplemented by a more phenomenological approach .",
    "this is particularly the case in collisions involving hadrons , where the non - perturbative regime of qcd plays a major role , especially in the hadronisation stage , as do parton density functions , fragmentation and  especially at high energies  the underlying event , i.e.  the part of the hadronic final state that is not coherent with the hard scatter .",
    "these effects are illustrated in figure  [ collision ] .",
    "calculations using only the well understood `` hard '' regime of qcd can provide only an incomplete test of the standard model and of theories that go beyond it .",
    "models that include these more complicated effects and provide a full description of the final state , generally implemented as monte carlo event generators , fill a number of roles in high - energy physics . as well as providing predictions that can be used to test the agreement between theory and experiment , they are extensively used to correct for detector effects in making measurements , to estimate the background to processes of interest , and to make predictions of both standard and exotic processes for use in planning analyses and designing future accelerators and detectors .",
    "the models used to describe these processes typically have a large number of free or weakly constrained parameters , which must be tuned to the data .",
    "this is a complicated task , as the same parameter may affect the predictions for different measurements in widely differing way .",
    "it is relatively easy to tune a parameter or limited set of parameters in order to provide a good description of a particular observable , only to spoil the agreement of the model with other data .",
    "it is therefore important to compare models simultaneously to a wide range of data from different colliding particles in different energy regimes , including older data from experiments that may no longer be running , but still constrain the range of acceptable models .",
    "it is to provide a solution to this problem that hztool  @xcite has been developed , and rivet  @xcite is now being created .",
    "these packages form an essential part of the wider programme of work being carried out by the cedar  @xcite collaboration .",
    "in order to enable meaningful comparisons between data and monte carlo predictions , both hztool and rivet must incorporate routines or modules that encapsulate information about the meaning of the measured quantities that goes beyond the simple numerical values stored in the hepdata  @xcite database .",
    "these routines must make the data available for future studies and model comparisons that may not have been possible when the data was published .",
    "the precise meaning of an observable and the procedure used to produce it may be hard to reconstruct from the published paper .",
    "it is therefore useful for the routine to be written , if possible , by the authors of the original analysis .",
    "the framework must cleanly separate the analysis routine from any individual event generator , reading the event information only via a common interface .",
    "this means that the routine can be used unchanged with any generator , rather than being restricted to those in use at the time the measurement was made and published .",
    "hztool and rivet provide essential low - level tools enabling the comparison of theoretical predictions with experimental data",
    ". they may be used as stand - alone packages , but there are also a number of ways in which their functionality can be extended .",
    "jetweb  @xcite uses hztool as a back end ( and will in future use rivet ) but adds a web interface and a database of predictions , and is described in another contribution to these proceedings  @xcite .",
    "this reduces duplication of effort by enabling predictions generated by one user to be reused by others , but still requires the user to specify the model of interest including any parameter values that differ from the defaults .",
    "there is clearly scope for higher - level tools that automatically vary parameters in order to find improved models .",
    "professor  @xcite is an example of an attempt to do this .",
    "the hztool framework , written in fortran 77 , was originally developed as part of the workshop on future physics at hera in 1997 .",
    "it started with an emphasis on hera results , but subsequently it has been expanded to cover a wider range of measurements .",
    "hztool has recently become part of the cedar project , and some further development has taken place in order to improve its modularity and to bring together some of the different versions that were in use into a single easily available package .",
    "development has been moved to the hepforge  @xcite environment .",
    "each included experimental analysis has a corresponding fortran subroutine in hztool .",
    "this subroutine takes events from a monte carlo event generation run and fills histograms in order to produce data and plots that can be compared directly with the experimental results . in the most recent version , hztool is purely a library of analysis routines and associated utilities such as jet finders , which may be used by a number of different routines .",
    "the main programs and steering routines that were formerly part of the package have been split off into a separate package , hzsteer , which is designed chiefly as an interface between jetweb and hztool , although it can also be used to run hztool independently of jetweb .",
    "this separation means that hztool is completely independent of any monte carlo generators , with all such dependencies existing only in hzsteer .",
    "the hepevt common block is used in order to make the code independent of the particular generator used .",
    "histogramming is done using the hbook histogramming package that forms part of the cernlib  @xcite library .",
    "as part of the cedar project , hztool is being adapted to provide model descriptions in hepml  @xcite format and to use hepdata as a source of experimental data rather than duplicating the information in fortran data statements .",
    "figure  [ lincol ] shows some histograms created using hztool as part of a study of monte carlo tuning for the international linear collider  @xcite .",
    "the continuous black line shows the predictions of the default herwig  @xcite model for dijet production in @xmath0 events in @xmath1 collisions at a centre - of - mass energy of 500  gev .",
    "the other curves show the predictions of models using herwig with parameters tuned to a range of jet production data from hera , lep and the tevatron .",
    "the results show the benefit of systematic tuning , since the models that have been tuned to a wide range of data show reasonable agreement with one another , despite differing significantly from the generator default settings .",
    "collisions at a centre - of - mass energy of 500  gev . from  @xcite.,width=302 ]",
    "rivet uses an object - oriented design , implemented in c++ , to make the framework easier to maintain than hztool , as well as making it easier to interact with the more recent c++ monte carlo programs .    wherever possible",
    ", interaction between rivet and other software and data will use common interfaces rather than introducing unnecesary dependences on particular packages .",
    "this includes the use of hepmc  @xcite for accessing information about the generated events .",
    "it is important that when a new generator ( or version ) is released , its predictions can be compared to all data in the rivet library without the need to modify each analysis routine .",
    "the use of hepdata for access to data and the hepml interface for input and output of monte carlo configurations is being incorporated in rivet from the start .",
    "the creation of histograms will be dealt with using the aida  @xcite interface .    rather than reimplement",
    "jet finders and other general analysis utilities already available elsewhere , rivet will make use of existing libraries such as ktjet  @xcite . where suitable general - purpose ( i.e.  independent of any particular experiment s framework ) tools are not available , we will try where possible to make our solutions available and usable without depending on rivet .",
    "as in the case of hztool and hzsteer , the steering and all generator - dependent code is in a separate package , rivetgun , so that the rivet library can be compiled without any generator code and does not need to be recompiled in order to use it with a new generator .",
    "each physics paper implemented in rivet will be represented by an analysis `` module '' .",
    "the analysis modules have access to a collection of projection classes , each of which calculates some property of an event .",
    "a projection may be built up from a series of simpler projections .",
    "for example , a projection that finds jets in an event might call on another projection to select particles in the event .",
    "rivet will run roughly as follows :    * a run will in general use a single generator with one combination of beam particles , energies and steering parameters .",
    "* a rivethandler will be instantiated , and will be given a collection of analysis objects to use , each corresponding to a physics paper with measurements to be compared to the generator predictions .",
    "* analysis classes will inherit from a common base class , analysisbase .",
    "each such class will use projection objects to calculate event properties and implement kinematic cuts . *",
    "a projection takes an event and constructs some property of the event , which may be a single number ( e.g. @xmath2 ) or a more complex object such as a set of jets boosted to a particular coordinate frame . *",
    "each projection object is instantiated along with the analysis at the beginning of a run , but only acts on the current event if and when it is actually asked for the information .",
    "once it has carried out its calculation it caches the result , which can then be accessed again by the same analysis or a different analysis , thus saving a significant amount of time in the case of e.g. a jet algorithm .",
    "* once an analysis has used a series of projections to calculate the quantities of interest and apply any necessary cuts , it uses the rivet histogramming code to fill the relevant histograms .",
    "this will probably involve simply using the aida interfaces to invoke whatever histogramming package is chosen by the user .",
    "hztool has been actively used for eight years , both as a stand - alone application and as the back - end to the jetweb interface .",
    "it will continue to be maintained as long as the knowledge encoded in its routines is not available in another form .",
    "however , active development will soon cease in favour of rivet , and once rivet is available collaborations will be encouraged to provide rivet modules instead of hztool subroutines .",
    "these frameworks provide a fundamental part of the cedar programme , making use of other cedar projects such as hepdata , and providing an input to higher - level tools such as jetweb , and potentially to more automated tuning systems such as professor .",
    "while a clear timescale is set by lhc start - up , and the short - term goals of cedar are directed towards this , the project will not stop there but will continue to provide a valuable resource for the linear collider and other future facillities .",
    "the cedar team would like to thank the uk particle physics and astronomy research council ( pparc ) for their generous support of cedar .",
