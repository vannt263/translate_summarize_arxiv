    "the ratio @xmath0 and the bottom quark forward  backward asymmetry @xmath1 are important parameters in precision studies of the standard model @xcite and are sensitive probes to new physics .",
    "their values have been measured very precisely at the z pole @xcite .",
    "the measurements of these two quantities at centre  of  mass energies above the z peak provide further tests of the standard model and put additional constraints on new physics , such as contact interactions @xcite .    in this paper the measurements of @xmath2 at centre  of  mass energies between 130 and 189 and of @xmath1 at @xmath4 obtained with the l3 detector @xcite at lep are described .",
    "the main features that distinguish the production of @xmath6 pairs from lighter quark production are the long lifetime and hard fragmentation of b  flavoured hadrons and the large lepton momentum in semileptonic decays .",
    "the measurement of @xmath2 is based on a b  tagging method using lifetime information which uses data taken with the l3 silicon microvertex detector ( smd ) @xcite .",
    "the measurement of @xmath1 exploits the characteristic semileptonic decays of b  hadrons and relies on the good lepton identification and lepton energy resolution of the l3 detector .",
    "it requires leptons with high momentum along and transverse to the direction of the associated jet , caused by the hard fragmentation and high mass of the decaying hadron .",
    "similar measurements have been published by other lep collaborations @xcite .",
    "the data analysed in this paper are those collected by l3 from 1995 to 1998 at centre  of  mass energies between 130 and 189 .",
    "as the integrated luminosity at 130 and 136 is small , the corresponding data are combined and a luminosity weighted average centre  of  mass energy of 133.2 is used .",
    "the centre  of  mass energies and the corresponding integrated luminosities used in the analysis are summarised in table  [ tab : enelumi ] .",
    "the measurements of @xmath2 and @xmath1 are performed using a sample of @xmath7 events selected with criteria similar to those used for the measurement of the @xmath8 cross section @xcite .",
    "the signal events are required to have an effective centre  of  mass energy @xmath9 .",
    "this requirement rejects a large fraction of events with initial state radiation .",
    "mis - reconstruction of the effective @xmath10 energy induces a migration of radiative events to the kinematic region allowed by the cut on @xmath11 .",
    "this is taken into account in the analysis as an additional background , called radiative background .",
    "no correction is applied to the final results to take into account the interference between initial and final  state radiative corrections .    to further reject radiative events , the visible energy , @xmath12 ,",
    "is required to be greater than @xmath13 and the longitudinal energy imbalance must be less than @xmath14 .",
    "the events are selected in a fiducial region defined by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the polar angle of the thrust axis .",
    "this cut ensures good track quality and efficient lepton identification . for @xmath10 energies larger than the w  pair production threshold , additional cuts are needed to reject the @xmath17 background . to reject hadronic",
    "w decays , the variable @xmath18 is required to be less than 0.011 , where @xmath18 is the durham jet finding algorithm parameter @xcite for which the transition from three to four jets occurs . as the @xmath17 background increases for higher @xmath10 energies , the maximum allowed value of @xmath18 is lowered to 0.008 at @xmath19 and to 0.006 at 189 .",
    "furthermore , to reject semileptonic w decays , the transverse energy imbalance must be smaller than @xmath20 . for the @xmath1 analysis",
    "the presence of an identified electron or muon with an energy smaller than 40 is required .",
    "efficiency and background studies are performed for each centre  of  mass energy using the following event generators : pythia @xcite ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) , koralz @xcite ( @xmath23 ) , phojet @xcite ( hadronic two  photon collisions ) , koralw @xcite ( @xmath24 ) and excalibur @xcite ( @xmath25 ) , which includes the zz production diagrams .",
    "the measurement of @xmath2 is based on a b  tagging algorithm that exploits the relatively large decay length of b ",
    "hadrons@xcite . the confidence level , @xmath26 , that a set of @xmath27 tracks originated from the primary vertex , is constructed using the decay length significance @xmath28 of each track .",
    "first the crossing point of each track with the closest jet is determined in both the @xmath29 and @xmath30 projections .",
    "then the signed distances ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) between these crossing points and the reconstructed primary event vertex are projected onto the jet axis to determine the decay length , @xmath33 . if the probability that both @xmath29 and @xmath30 measurements are compatible exceeds 5% , then the two are combined .",
    "otherwise , only the @xmath29 projection is used .",
    "small biases in @xmath31 and @xmath32 are removed by recalibrating their mean values as functions of the azimuthal and polar angles of the tracks .",
    "the errors on @xmath31 and @xmath32 are parametrised to take into account the contributions coming from the track fit , the primary vertex position measurement and the effect of multiple scattering .",
    "the estimated errors on @xmath31 and @xmath32 are rescaled by comparing their values with those observed in a sample of tracks with negative decay length .",
    "the scale factors are found to be within 10% of unity .",
    "the tracking resolution depends critically on the pattern of smd hits associated to the tracks .",
    "therefore the tracks are grouped into different classes according to the vertex detector hit pattern and for each class different resolution parameters are considered .",
    "the study of the tracking resolution described above is performed using samples of hadronic z decays corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about @xmath34 each , collected each year during calibration runs at the z peak .",
    "the confidence level , @xmath26 , is calculated by taking into account the fraction of tracks with positive decay length , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the number of tracks with positive decay length .",
    "the probability that a track originated from the primary vertex , @xmath37 , is obtained by fitting the distribution of the decay length significance for tracks with negative decay length .",
    "the shape of this distribution is due to detector resolution effects and is modelled by a resolution function parametrised as the sum of two gaussians and an exponential tail .",
    "the distributions of the discriminant variable @xmath38 obtained at the different centre  of  mass energies are shown in figure  [ fig : discrim ] .",
    "the measurement of @xmath2 is performed using an event  tag method by counting the events containing b quarks .",
    "the b  events are selected by applying a cut on the discriminant where the cut position is chosen so that the expected statistical error on the cross section @xmath39 is minimised .",
    "given the number @xmath40 of tagged events and @xmath41 of tagged background events , @xmath2 is derived from the formula : @xmath42 , \\label{eq : rbbdef}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are respectively the total number of selected @xmath45 events in data and the total number of background events from monte carlo ; @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the tagging efficiencies for b , c and light quarks , respectively , and are estimated from monte carlo .    the value of the @xmath49 production cross section , @xmath50 , is taken from the standard model prediction calculated by zfitter @xcite .",

    "the background includes the contribution from non@xmath45 events and the contamination of radiative hadronic events .",
    "the radiative background decreases from 16% at 133 to 4% at 189 .",
    "the background due to processes other than @xmath55 is dominated by hadronic w decays for @xmath56 and varies from 1% at @xmath57 to 11% at 189 .",
    "the background from @xmath25 events is at the level of 1% at 189 and negligible at lower @xmath10 energies .",
    "the contribution from other processes is negligible .",
    "the number of selected and tagged events and the background contamination both in the total and in the tagged sample for each centre  of  mass energy are shown in table  [ tab : rbbresults ] .",
    "the tagging efficiencies are also quoted along with their statistical errors . the b tagging efficiency decreases slightly with increasing @xmath10 energy due to the larger non@xmath45 background contribution .",
    "the measured values of @xmath2 are shown in table  [ tab : rbbresults ] together with their statistical errors .",
    "the stability of the measurements has been checked by varying the cut on the b  tagging discriminant .",
    "the results of this check for the two high statistics samples at @xmath19 and 189 are shown in figure  [ fig : rbbvariation ] .",
    "no statistically significant deviation from the @xmath2 value obtained with the nominal cut is observed .",
    "the event  tag method used in this analysis has been cross  checked by measuring @xmath2 using the calibration data collected each year at the z peak .",
    "the results are found to be in good agreement with our published value @xcite .",
    "the largest contribution to the systematic uncertainty on @xmath2 comes from the description of the tracking resolution function in the monte carlo , since it affects the estimation of the tagging efficiencies involved in the @xmath2 measurement . in order to study this source of systematic uncertainty ,",
    "several monte carlo samples were reconstructed , where the parameters used to describe the resolution function have been varied according to their estimated uncertainty .",
    "the differences between the values of @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 obtained from these monte carlo samples and the nominal values shown in table  [ tab : rbbresults ] have been propagated to obtain an estimation of the systematic uncertainty due to tracking resolution effects .",
    "another source of systematic uncertainty comes from the description in the monte carlo of the tracking efficiency and of the relative fraction of tracks with a given smd hit pattern . to study this effect ,",
    "the tracking efficiency has been varied in the monte carlo by @xmath58 and a migration of tracks at the level of 1% between the different classes has been introduced .",
    "the systematic uncertainty coming from this source has been obtained as above by propagating the variations on the flavour tagging efficiencies .",
    "the systematic uncertainties discussed above are added in quadrature to give the total systematic uncertainty due to tracking effects .",
    "the modelling of b and c quark fragmentation and decays introduces a systematic uncertainty on @xmath2 since the tagging efficiency for b and c quarks is obtained from monte carlo .",
    "modelling uncertainties of the b  hadron properties are estimated by varying the mean value of the b  hadron energy fraction @xmath59 , the charged decay multiplicity and the average lifetime of b  hadrons . for the estimation of @xmath47",
    "an accurate knowledge of production and decay properties of the c  hadrons is important , since the different species , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , have lifetimes varying in the range of 0.2 to 1.1 ps @xcite .",
