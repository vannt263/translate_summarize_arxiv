    "the discovery more than 30 years ago of the decay @xmath3 by christianson , cronin , fitch and turlay @xcite provided the first indication that cp , like parity , was also not a good symmetry of nature .",
    "it is rather surprising that , for such a mature subject , we have still so little experimental information available .",
    "indeed , the only firm evidence for cp violation to date remains that deduced from meausurements in the neutral kaon system .",
    "here there are five parameters meausured : the values of the the two complex amplitude ratios for the decays of @xmath4 and @xmath5 to @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) and to @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , plus the semileptonic asymmetry in @xmath4 decays ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "semileptonic asymmetry , @xmath11 , which agrees with @xmath10 within 10% .",
    "] however , in fact , these five numbers at present give only one * independent * piece of dynamical information . to a very good approximation",
    "@xcite , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are equal in magnitude @xmath14 and in phase @xmath15 with the ratio @xmath16 because the two pion intermediate states dominate the neutral kaon width , assuming cpt conservation @xcite the phases @xmath17 and @xmath18 are approximately equal to the superweak phase @xmath19 cpt conservation also fixes the value of the semileptonic asymmetry in terms of @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "since @xmath21 is so small , effectively one has @xcite @xmath22 thus the dynamical information we have today is , essentially , that obtained in the original discovery experiment@xcite , augmented by the statement that there is little or no @xmath0 cp violation !",
    "the above statement is a bit of an exaggeration , since in the last 30 years we have learned very much more about cp violation * outside * the neutral kaon complex .",
    "in particular , very strong bounds have been established for the electric dipole moments of the neutron and the electron @xcite @xmath23 furthermore , we have uncovered the fundamental role that cp violation plays in the universe , to help establish the observed matter - antimatter asymmetry @xcite .",
    "in addition , we have a variety of bounds on a host of other cp violating parameters , like the amplitude ratios @xmath24 and @xmath25 for @xmath26 decays , or the transverse muon polarization @xmath27 in @xmath2 decays .",
    "these bounds , however , are too insensitive to provide much dynamical information",
    ".    in the modern gauge theory paradigm cp violation can have one of two possible origins . either ,    i )",
    ": :    the full lagrangian of the theory is cp invariant , but this symmetry    is not preserved by the vacuum state : cp @xmath28 . in this case",
    "cp is a spontaneously broken symmetry    @xcite .    or",
    "ii ) : :    there are terms in the lagrangian of the theory which are not    invariant under cp transformations .",
    "cp is explicitly broken by these    terms and is no longer a symmetry of the theory .",
    "the first possibility , unfortunately , runs into a potential cosmological problem@xcite .",
    "as the universe cools below a temperature @xmath29 where spontaneous cp violation occurs , one expects that domains of different cp should form .",
    "these domains are separated by walls having a typical surface energy density @xmath30 .",
    "the energy density associated with these walls dissipates slowly as the universe cools further and eventually contributes an energy density to the universe at temperature t of order @xmath31 .",
    "such an energy density today would typically exceed the universe closure density by many orders of magnitude : @xmath32 one can avoid this difficulty by imaging that the scale where cp is spontaneously violated is very high , so that @xmath29 is above the temperature where inflation occurs . in this case",
    "the problem disappears , since the domains get inflated anyway .",
    "nevertheless , there are still problems since it proves difficult to connect this high energy spontaneous breaking of cp with observed phenomena at low energies .",
    "what emerges , in general , are models which are quite complex @xcite , with cp violation being associated with new interactions much as in the original superweak model of wolfenstein@xcite .    if , on the other hand , cp is explicitly broken the phenomenology of neutral kaon cp violation is a quite natural result of the standard model of the electroweak interactions .",
    "there is , however , a requirement emerging from the demand of renormalizability which bears mentioning .",
    "namely , if cp is explicitly broken then renormalizability requires that all the parameters in the lagrangian which can be complex must be so .",
    "a corollary of this observation is that the number of possible cp violating phases in a theory increases with the complexity of the theory , since there are then more terms which can have imaginary coefficients .    in this respect ,",
    "the three generation ( @xmath33 ) standard model with only one higgs doublet is the simplest possible model , since it has only one phase . with just one higgs doublet",
    ", the hermiticity of the scalar potential allows no complex parameters to appear .",
    "if cp is not a symmetry , complex yukawa couplings are , however , allowed .",
    "after the breakdown of the @xmath34 symmetry , these couplings produce complex mass matrices . going to a physical basis with real diagonal masses introduces a complex mixing matrix in the charged currents of the theory .",
    "for the quark sector , this is the famous cabibbo - kobayashi maskawa ( ckm ) matrix@xcite .",
    "this @xmath35 unitary matrix contains @xmath36 real angles and @xmath37 phases .",
    "however , @xmath38 of these phases can be rotated away by redefinitions of the quark fields leaving only @xmath39 phases .",
    "thus for @xmath33 the standard model has only one physical complex phase to describe all cp violating phenomena .",
    "if cp is broken explicitly , it follows by the renormalizability corollary that any extensions of the sm will involve further cp violating phases .",
    "for instance , if one has two higgs doublets , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , then the hermiticity of the scalar potential no longer forbids the appearance of complex terms like @xmath42 indeed , if one did not include such terms the presence of complex yukawa couplings would induce such terms at one loop .",
    "the gauge sector of the @xmath43 standard model contains no explicit phases since the gauge fields are in the adjoint representation , which is real , leading to real gauge couplings .",
    "nevertheless , the nontrivial nature of the gauge theory vacuum @xcite introduces a phase structure ( @xmath44 vacua @xcite ) which allows for the presence of effective cp - violating interactions , involving the non abelian gauge field strengths and their duals : @xmath45 the weak vacuum angle @xmath46 is actually irrelevant since the electroweak theory is chiral and through a chiral rotation this angle can be set to zero @xcite .",
    "the phase angle @xmath47 , on the other hand , is problematic .",
    "first of all , what contributes physically is not @xmath47 , since this angle receives additional contributions from the weak interaction sector as a result of the chiral rotations that render the quark mass matrices diagonal .",
    "thus , in reality , the cp - violating efffective interaction is @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the quark mass matrix .",
    "the presence of such an interaction in the standard model gives rise to a large contribution to the neutron electric dipole moment .",
    "one has , approximately @xcite , @xmath51 with @xmath52 a typical light quark mass .",
    "thus , to respect the existing experimental bounds on @xmath53 @xcite , @xmath54 must be extremely small : @xmath55 why this should be so is unclear and constitutes the strong cp problem @xcite .",
    "there are three possible attitudes one can take regarding the strong cp problem :    i ) : :    one can just ignore this problem altogether .",
    "afterall ,    @xmath54 is yet another uncalculable parameter in    the standard model , no different say than the unexplained ratio    @xmath56 .",
    "so why should one worry about this    parameter explicitly ?",
    "ii ) : :    one can try to calculate @xmath54 and thereby    `` explain '' the size of the neutron electric dipole moment . to do so",
    ",    one must imagine that cp is spontaneously broken , so that indeed    @xmath54 is a finite calculable quantity .",
    "however ,    as was mentioned earlier , then one runs into the domain wall problem .",
    "models that avoid this problem and which , in principle , produce a tiny    calculable @xmath54 exist",
    ". however , they are quite    recondite @xcite and the price one pays for solving the strong cp    problem this way is to introduce considerable hidden underlying    structure beneath the standard model .",
    "iii ) : :    one can try to dynamically remove @xmath54 from    the theory .",
    "this is my favorite solution , which i suggested long ago    with helen quinn @xcite .",
    "quinn and i proposed solving the strong cp    problem by imagining that the standard model has an additional global    chiral symmetry .",
    "the presence of this , so called ,    @xmath57 symmetry allows one to rotate away    @xmath54 , much as the chiral nature of the    @xmath58 electroweak theory allows one to    rotate away @xmath59 .",
    "however , this solution also    requires that axions exist @xcite and these elusive particles have    yet to be detected @xcite ! an alternative possibility along",
    "this vein    is that the standard model has a natural chiral symmetry built in ,    which removes @xmath54 because @xmath60    @xcite.however , this solution appears unlikely , as    @xmath60 is disfavored by current algebra analyses @xcite .",
    "it is fair to say that there is no clear understanding of what to do about the strong cp problem at the moment .",
    "my own view is that the existence of this unresolved problem is something that should not be ignored .",
    "there is a message here and it may simply be that we do not understand cp violation at all !    in the standard model , with one higgs doublet and three generations of quarks and leptons , besides the strong cp phase @xmath54 there is only one other cp - violating angle in the theory .",
    "this is the combination of phases in the yukawa couplings of the quarks to the higgs doublet which remains after all redefinition of quark fields , leading to a diagonal mass matrix , are done .",
    "this weak cp - violating angle appears as a phase in the ckm mixing matrix , @xmath61 , which details the coupling of the quarks to the charged @xmath62-bosons : @xmath63 however , one does not really know if the complex phase present in the ckm matrix is responsible for the cp violating phenomena observed in the neutral kaon system .",
    "indeed , one does not know either whether there are further phases besides the ckm phase .",
    "nevertheless , it is remarkable that , as a result of the hierarchial structure of the ckm matrix and of other dynamical circumstances , one can * qualitatively * explain all we know experimentally about cp violation today on the basis of the ckm picture .      in what follows ,",
    "i make use of the ckm matrix in the parametrization adopted by the pdg@xcite and expand the three real angles in the manner suggested by wolfenstein@xcite in powers of the sine of the cabibbo angle @xmath64 . to order @xmath65 one has then @xmath66 with @xmath67 and @xmath68 being parameters one needs to fix from experiments  with @xmath69 signalling cp violation .",
    "to write this in terms of a magnitude and phase : @xmath70 , with @xmath71 being the cp violating ckm phase . ]",
    "this matrix , with is hierarchical interfamily structure , naturally accounts for the three principal pieces of independent information that we have today on cp violation .",
    "as we discussed earlier , these are :    i ) : :    the value of the mass mixing parameter    @xmath72 , which characterizes the    strength of the @xmath4 to @xmath5    amplitude ratios .",
    "ii ) : :    the small value of the @xmath73 parameter which    typifies direct ( @xmath0 ) cp violation , with the    ratio @xmath74 .",
    "iii ) : :    the very strong bounds on the electric dipole moments of the neutron    and the electron , which give    @xmath75 .    one can  understand \" the above three facts quite simply within the standard model and the ckm paradigm . in the model",
    "the parameter @xmath76 is determined by the ratio of the imaginary to the real part of the box graph of fig .",
    "it is easy to check that this ratio is of order @xmath77 that is , @xmath76 is naturally small because of the suppression of interfamily mixing without requiring the ckm phase @xmath71 to be small .    the explanation of why @xmath78 is small is a bit more dynamical .",
    "basically , this ratio is suppressed both because of the @xmath79 rule and because @xmath21 arises through the penguin diagrams of fig.1b .",
    "these diagrams involve the emission of virtual gluons ( or photons rule , but these diagrams are only of @xmath80 , not @xmath81 . ] ) , which are zweig suppressed@xcite .",
    "typically this gives @xmath82 \\sim 10^{-3}~.\\ ] ]    finally , in the ckm model the electric dipole moments are small since the first nonvanishing contributions@xcite occur at three loops , as shown in fig .",
    "1c , leading to the estimate@xcite @xmath83 \\left[\\frac{m_t^2 m_b^2}{m_{\\rm w}^6}\\right ] \\lambda^6 \\sin \\delta \\sim 10^{-32}~{\\rm ecm}~.\\ ] ]       one can , of course , use the precise value of @xmath76 measured experimentally to determine an allowed region for the parameters entering in the ckm matrix . because of theoretical uncertainties in evaluating the hadronic matrix element of the @xmath84 operator associated with the box graph of fig .",
    "1a , this parameter space region is rather large .",
    "further restrictions on the allowed values of ckm parameters come from semileptonic b decays and from @xmath85 mixing . because the parameter @xmath86 , related to @xmath87 , is better known , it has become traditional to present the result of these analyses as a plot in the @xmath88 plane .",
    "2 shows the results of a recent analysis , done in collaboration with my student , k. wang@xcite .",
    "the input parameters used , as well as the range allowed for certain hadronic amplitudes and other ckm matrix elements is detailed in table 1    @xmath89    the resulting @xmath90 allowed contour emerging from the overlap of the three constraints coming from @xmath76 , @xmath91 mixing and the ratio of @xmath92 , shown in fig . 3 ,",
    "gives a roughly symmetric region around @xmath93 within the ranges @xmath94       as anticipated by our qualitative discussion this region implies that the ckm phase @xmath71 is large ( @xmath93 corresponds to @xmath95 ) .",
    "one should note , however , that this analysis does not establish the ckm paradigm . using only the b physics constraints one sees that in fig .",
    "2 there is also an overlap region for @xmath96 , which gives @xmath97 @xcite .",
    "so one can still imagine that @xmath76 is due to some other cp violating interaction , as in the superweak model @xcite , with the ckm phase @xmath71 being very small .",
    "as wang and i @xcite discussed , one may perhaps eliminate this possibility by improving the bounds on @xmath98 mixing to @xmath99 .",
    "since the present lep bound from aleph is @xmath100 @xcite , this is not going to be easy .",
    "much more promising , however , is to try to establish the correctedness of the ckm paradigm by looking at further tests of cp violation , both in the kaon system and by meausuring cp - violating asymmetries in b - decays .    in principle",
    ", one can obtain quantitative tests of the ckm model purely with kaon experiments .",
    "however , the needed experiments are very challenging , either due to the high precision required or due to the rarity of the processes to be studied . furthermore , the analysis of these results is also theoretically very difficult , since it requires better estimates of hadronic matrix elements than what we have at present .",
    "a good example of both of these challenges is provided by @xmath1 . the present data on this ratio is inconclusive , with the result obtained at fermilab @xcite : @xmath101}~,\\ ] ] being consistent with zero within the error ,",
    "while the result of the na31 experiment at cern @xcite giving a non - zero value to @xmath102 : @xmath103}~.\\ ] ] theoretically , the predictions for @xmath1 are dependent both on the value of the ckm matrix elements and , more importantly , on an estimate of certain hadronic matrix elements .",
    "there has been considerable activity recently to try to narrow down the expectations for @xmath1 in the standard model . to describe the theoretical status here ,",
    "i find it useful to make use of an approximate formula for this ratio derived by buras and lautenbacher @xcite .",
    "these authors express the real part of this ratio as the sum of two terms and @xmath105 @xmath106 phase shifts is also near @xmath107 @xcite , to a good approximation @xmath108 . ]",
    "@xmath109~.\\ ] ] here @xmath110 and @xmath111 are quantities related to the matrix elements of the dominant gluonic and electroweak penguin operators , respectively .",
    "the electroweak penguin contribution is suppressed relative to the gluonic penguin contribution by a factor of @xmath112 .",
    "however , as remarked earlier , it does not suffer from the @xmath113 suppression and so one gains back a factor of about 20 .",
    "furthermore , as flynn and randall @xcite first noted , the contribution of these terms can become significant for large top mass because it grows approximately as @xmath114 .",
    "the result of the ckm analysis presented earlier brackets @xmath115 in the range @xmath116 for @xmath117 the square bracket in the buras - lautenbacher formula reduces to [ @xmath118 .",
    "hence one can write the expectation from theory for @xmath1 as @xmath119 \\leq { \\rm re}~\\frac{\\epsilon^\\prime}{\\epsilon } \\leq 11.2 \\times 10^{-4 } [ b_6 - 0.75b_8]~.\\ ] ] because the top mass is so large , the predicted value for @xmath1 depends rather crucially on * both * @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "these ( normalized ) matrix elements have been estimated by both lattice @xcite and @xmath120 @xcite calculations to be equal to each other , with an individual error of @xmath121 : @xmath122 thus , unfortunately , the combination entering in @xmath123 is poorly known .",
    "it appears that the best one can say theoretically is that @xmath124 should be a ",
    "few \" times @xmath125 , with a ",
    "few \" being difficult to pin down more precisely .",
    "theory , at any rate , seems to favor the e731 experimental result over that of na31 .",
    "fortunately , we may learn something more in this area in the near future .",
    "there are 3rd generation experiments in preparation both at fermilab ( ktev ) and cern ( na48 ) .",
    "these experiments should begin taking data in a year or so and are designed to reach statistical and systematic accuracy for @xmath1 at the level of @xmath125 .",
    "the frascati @xmath126 factory daphne , which should begin operations in 1997 , in principle , can also provide interesting information for @xmath1 . at daphne one",
    "will need an integrated luminosity of @xmath127 to arrive at a statistical sensitivity for @xmath1 at the level of @xmath125 .",
    "however , if this statistical sensitivity is reached , the systematic uncertainties will be quite different than those at ktev and na48 , providing a very useful cross - check .",
    "it is important to remark that , irrespective of detailed theoretical predictions , the observation of a non - zero value for @xmath123 at a significant level would provide direct evidence for @xmath0 cp violation and would rule out a superweak explanation for the observed cp violation in the neutral k sector .",
    "there are alternatives to the @xmath1 measurement which could reveal @xmath0 ( direct ) cp violation .",
    "however , these alternatives involve daunting experiments@xcite , which are probably out of reach in the near term . whether these experiments can ( or will ? ) eventually be carried out is an open question .",
    "nevertheless , it seems worthwhile here to try to outline some of the theoretical expectations for these meausurments .",
    "cp lear already , and daphne soon , will enable a more thorough study of @xmath5 decays by more efficient tagging .",
    "the decay @xmath128 is cp - violating , while the @xmath129 mode has both cp - conserving and cp - violating pieces .",
    "however , even in this case the cp - conserving piece is small and vanishes in the center of the dalitz plot . hence one can extract information about cp violation from @xmath130 decays .",
    "the analogue @xmath131 amplitude ratios to @xmath12 and @xmath13 for @xmath26 have both @xmath0 and @xmath84 pieces : @xmath132 however , in contrast to what obtains in the @xmath133 case , here the @xmath0 pieces can be larger .",
    "cheng @xcite gives estimates for @xmath134 and @xmath135 of @xmath136 , while others are more pessimistic @xcite .",
    "even so , there does not appear to be any realistic prospects in the near future to probe for @xmath0 cp - violating amplitudes in @xmath130 .",
    "for instance , at daphne even with an integrated luminosity of @xmath137 one can only reach an accuracy for @xmath24 and @xmath25 of order @xmath138 , which is at the level of @xmath76 not @xmath73 .",
    "cp violating effects involving charged kaons can only be due to @xmath0 transitions , since @xmath139 @xmath84 mixing is forbidden by charge conservation . a typical cp - violating effect in charged kaon decays necessitates a comparison between @xmath140 and @xmath141 processes .",
    "however , a cp - violating asymmetry between these processes can occur only if there are at least two decay amplitudes involved and these amplitudes have * both * a relative weak cp - violating phase and a relative strong rescattering phase between each other .",
    "thus the resulting asymmetry necessarily depends on strong dynamics .    to appreciate this fact , imagine writing the decay amplitude for @xmath140 decay to a final state @xmath142 as @xmath143 then the corresponding amplitude for the decay @xmath144 is @xmath145 that is , the strong rescattering phases are the same but one complex conjugates the weak amplitudes . from the above",
    ", one sees that the rate asymmetry between these processes is @xmath146    unfortunately , detailed calculations in the standard ckm paradigm for rate asymmetries and asymmetries in dalitz plot parameters for various charged kaon decays give quite tiny predictions .",
    "this can be qualitatively understood as follows .",
    "the ratio @xmath147 is typically that of a penguin amplitude to a weak decay amplitude and so is of order @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , because of the small phase space for @xmath26 decays , or because one is dealing with electromagnetic rescattering in @xmath148 , the rescattering contribution suppress these asymmetries even more .",
    "table 2 gives typical predictions , contrasting them to the expected reach of the frascati @xmath126 factory with @xmath149 .",
    "for the @xmath26 decays , belkov _ et al . _",
    "@xcite give numbers at least a factor of 10 above those given in table 2 .",
    "however , these numbers are predicated on having very large rescattering phases which do not appear to be realistic@xcite .",
    "one is lead to conclude that , if the ckm paradigm is correct , it is unlikely that one will see a cp - violating signal in charged kaon decays .",
    ".predictions for asymmetries in @xmath150 decays [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      perhaps more promising are decays of the @xmath4 to @xmath152 plus lepton pairs .",
    "if the lepton pair is charged , then the process has a cp conserving piece in which the decay proceeds via a @xmath153 intermediate state .",
    "although there was some initial controversy @xcite , the rate for the process @xmath154 arising from the cp - conserving @xmath153 transitiion is probably at , or below , the @xmath155 level @xcite : @xmath156 thus this contribution is just a small correction to the dominant cp - violating amplitude arising from an effective spin 1 virtual state , @xmath157 .",
    "since @xmath158 is cp even , this part of the amplitude is cp - violating .",
    "it has two distinct pieces @xcite : an indirect contribution from the cp even piece ( @xmath159 ) in the @xmath4 state , and a direct @xmath0 cp - violating piece coming from the @xmath160 part of @xmath161 : @xmath162    to isolate the interesting direct cp contribution in this process requires understanding first the size of the indirect contribution .",
    "the amplitude @xmath163 could be determined absolutely if one had a measurement of the process @xmath164 . since this is not at hand , at the moment one has to rely on various guesstimates .",
    "these give the following range for the indirect cp - violating branching ratio@xcite @xmath165 where the smaller number is the estimate coming from chiral perturbation theory , while the other comes from relating @xmath163 to the analogous amplitude for charged k decays .",
    "the calculation of the direct cp - violating contribution to the process @xmath166 , as a result of electroweak penguin and box contributions and their gluonic corrections , is perhaps the one that is most reliably known .",
    "the branching ratio obtained by buras , lautenbacher , misiak and mnz in their next to leading order calculation of this process@xcite is @xmath167 where the error arises mostly from the imperfect knowledge of the ckm matrix .",
    "experimentally one has the following 90% c.l .",
    "for the two @xmath166 processes : @xmath168 the first limit comes from the e799 experiment at fermilab@xcite , while the second limit combines the bounds obtained by the e845 experiment at brookhaven@xcite and the e799 fermilab experiment@xcite .",
    "forthcoming experiments at kek and fermilab should be able to improve these limits by at least an order of magnitude for this mode , while ktev hopes to push this br down to @xmath169 .",

    "even more distant experiments in the future may actually reach the level expected theoretically for the @xmath171 rate @xcite .",
    "however , it will be difficult to unravel the direct cp - violating contribution from the indirect cp - violating contribution , unless the @xmath172 rate is also measured simultaneously .    in this respect ,",
    "the process @xmath173 is very much cleaner .",
    "this process is purely cp - violating , since it has no @xmath153 contribution .",

    "next to leading qcd calculations for the direct rate have been carried out by buchalla and buras@xcite , who give the following approximate formula for the branching ratio for this process @xmath175 this value is very far below the present 90% c.l .",

    "if the ckm paradigm is correct , the analysis of current constraints on the ckm matrix shows that the cp - violating phase @xmath71 is sizable .",
    "the reason why one has * small * cp - violating effects in the kaon sector is solely due to the interfamily mixing suppression . in @xmath193 and @xmath194",

    "thus the study of cp violation in b - decays appears very promising .    to produce cp - violating effects , as usual",
    ", one has to have interference between two amplitudes that have different cp - violating phases .",
    "because one is interested in looking for potentially large sources of cp violation in b - decays , it is important to identify where in the b system sizable phases may reside . within the ckm paradigm",
    "there are two places where large phases appear .",

    ", however , this graph is dominated by the contribution of the top quark loop and one has that @xmath199 where @xmath200 is the phase of the @xmath201 matrix element of the ckm matrix ( @xmath202 ) .",
    "if the ckm phase @xmath71 is large so is , in general , @xmath200 since @xmath203 the second place where a large phase appears is in any process involving , at the quark level , a @xmath204 transition since @xmath205 provides precisely a meausure of the ckm phase .",
    "the potentially large @xmath206 cp - violating phase @xmath200 is a prediction of the ckm paradigm which can be well tested , since this phase is unpolluted by strong interaction effects .",
    "this is also the case for the corresponding mixing phase arising from @xmath207 mixing .",
    "however , in this case the ckm prediction is that this phase should vanish , since @xmath208 is approximately real .",
    "so for the case of @xmath194 decays the relevant tests are null tests . at any rate , because of @xmath206 mixing , a state @xmath209 which at @xmath210 was a pure @xmath195 state , evolves in time into a superposition of @xmath195 and @xmath211 states : @xmath212~.\\ ] ] a similar formula applies for @xmath194 decays .",
    "it is also possible to isolate cleanly the cp - violating phases appearing at the quark level by comparing the decays of @xmath213 mesons into some definite final state @xmath214 to the corresponding transition of @xmath215 mesons to the charged - conjugate final state @xmath216 . if these transitions are dominated by a single quark decay amplitude @xcite , so that @xmath217 where @xmath218 is a strong rescattering phase , then the ratio of these two amplitudes will be directly sensitive to the quark decay phase . in these circumstances , for decays involving @xmath219 transitions , the ratio @xmath220 is a measure of the cp - violating phase @xmath71 . on the other hand ,",
    "the corresponding ratio of amplitudes which involve a @xmath221 transition at the quark level will contain no large cp - violating phase at all , since @xmath87 is real .    in view of the above considerations , the best way to study cp violation in neutral @xmath213-decays is through a comparison of the time evolution of decays of states",

    "the above equation reduces to @xmath241 which , upon dividing by @xmath242 , is precisely the equation describing the unitarity triangle .",
    "one possible unitarity triangle , with the angles @xmath243 and @xmath235 identified , is shown in fig .",
    "3 .    because our present knowledge of the ckm matrix still allows a considerable range for @xmath187 and @xmath68 , as shown in fig .",
    "3 , there is considerable uncertainty on what to expect for @xmath244 , @xmath245 and @xmath246 .",

    "4 , taken from my recent examination of this question with wang @xcite , which plots the presently allowed region in the @xmath250 plane . one sees from this figure that @xmath251 thus , in contrast to cp violation phenomena in the kaon system , for the b system within the ckm paradigm there are places where one expects to see large effects .    from the above discussion",
    ", it is clear that a particularly clean test of the ckm paradigm would be provided by the meausurement of @xmath245 , via the observation of a difference in the rates of specific @xmath193 and @xmath223 decays to cp self - conjugate states which involve a @xmath221 transition .",
    "a favored mode to study is the decay @xmath252 along with its conjugate @xcite .",
    "this decay has a largish branching ratio @xcite and quite a distinct signature from the leptonic decay of the @xmath253 .",
    "furthermore , one can argue that this decay is quite clean theoretically .",
    "recall that the identification of @xmath230 with one of the angles of the unitarity triangle required that the decay rate for the process @xmath254 be dominated by a single decay amplitude .",
    "this , in general , is only approximately true .",
    "for instance , for the process in question , at the quark level both a @xmath255 decay graph * and * a @xmath256 penguin graph contribute .",
    "however , although this decay involves more than one amplitude , both of these amplitudes have the * same * weak decay phase @xcite .",
    "the amplitude involving the quark decay graph has no weak phase since it involves a @xmath255 transition .",
    "this is also true for the @xmath256 penguin graph , since this graph is dominated by the top loop contribution which is dominantly real .",
    "hence , effectively , the ratio of @xmath257 to @xmath258 is , to a very good approximation , unity and @xmath259 indeed meausures @xmath260 .",
    "even though @xmath245 , at least in the ckm paradigm , is large , the meausurement of @xmath259 is far from trivial , since one must be able to determine whether the decaying state was born as a @xmath193 or a @xmath223 and one must have sufficient rate to detect the produced @xmath253 though its small leptonic decay mode .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that future meausurements of this and allied decay modes ( like @xmath261 @xcite ) perhaps at hera - b , but certainly at the b factories under construction at slac and kek and eventually in hadron colliders , offers an excellent chance of verifying- or put into question- the ckm paradigm .",
    "the prospects of meausuring the other two angles of the unitarity triangle , @xmath262 and @xmath235 , and thus of checking the ckm prediction @xmath263 , appear more difficult .",
    "these meausurments are , nevertheless , quite important . as winstein",
    "@xcite has pointed out , even if one were to meausure a large value for @xmath245 this still does not totally exclude a superweak explanation .",
    "one could imagine a perverse superweak model which , somehow , contained a small @xmath84 cp - violating mixing phase , of @xmath264 , but a large @xmath265 cp - violating mixing phase , @xmath266 .",
    "this model can be ruled out by meausuring the angle @xmath262 independently since , as there are no decay phases , it predicts that @xmath267 . as fig .",
    "4 shows , this \" superweak prediction is not excluded by present day data .",
    "thus , if by chance , future meausurements of @xmath262 and @xmath200 were to fall on the superweak line one would still need a measurement of @xmath235 to settle the issue . is the phase associated with @xmath268 mixing and does not necessarily vanish .",
    "however , in these models all @xmath194 decays to cp self - conjugate states , irrespective of whether they involve a @xmath269 or a @xmath221 transition , should produce @xmath270 . ]",
    "most likely , the decay mode @xmath271 is the process that is best suited to study the angle @xmath262 @xcite .",
    "however , the branching ratio for this mode is not yet totally in hand , but is probably quite small , of @xmath272 .",
    "decays into pairs of light mesons and has been able to determine the branching ratio for the sum of the decay rates into both @xmath273 and @xmath274 final states : @xmath275 @xcite . ]",
    "this mode also may suffer some penguin pollution , with estimates ranging from 1 % to 10 % in the amplitude @xcite .",
    "the cleo @xcite indications that the branching ratio of @xmath276 is approximately the same as that for @xmath277 give one already some assurances that the penguin amplitude in @xmath271 can not dominate the process , since this amplitude is smaller by a factor of @xmath278 compared to the @xmath276 amplitude .",
    "furthermore , in principle , one can isolate the contribution of the penguin graphs in the process @xmath279 by meausuring in addition the decays @xmath280 and @xmath281 @xcite .",
    "these extra meausurements allow for a complete isospin analysis of the amplitudes entering in these two body decays and an isolation of the relative rescattering phases .",
    "similar techniques @xcite may allow the extraction of the angle @xmath262 in other decay modes , like @xmath282 , which are not cp self - conjugate .",
    "the determination of the angle @xmath235 is even more problematic . in principle , this angle can be determined by studying the time evolution of certain @xmath194 decays . here ,",
    "perhaps , the best mode to study would be the decay @xmath283 .",
    "however , at the asymmetric b factories now under construction , meausurements of @xmath194 decays are unlikely .",
    "these colliders are optimized to operate at the @xmath284 and running above the @xmath194 production threshold will entail substantial loss of luminosity .",
    "thus a determination of @xmath285 from @xmath194 decays will have to await dedicated experiments at hadron colliders .",
    "one may , however , be able to determine @xmath235 , and thus the ckm phase @xmath71 , before that by utilizing different techniques .",
    "for instance , gronau and wyler @xcite , have shown that one could , in principle , extract @xmath235 by studying the charged b decays @xmath286 and their neutral counterparts , using isospinology to isolate the rescattering phases .",
    "it remains to be seen , however , whether this approach can really bear fruit in the presence of experimental errors .",
    "i would like to argue now a little more broadly about tests of cp violation .",
    "obviously , it is very important to check whether the ckm paradigm is correct .",
    "positive signals for @xmath287 will indicate the general validity of the ckm picture , since they require the presence of a @xmath288 phase .",
    "however , given the large theoretical uncertainty on the value of this quantity , it is clear that values of @xmath1 consistent with zero at the @xmath125 level can not disprove this picture . in my view , it is likely that what will provide the crucial smoking gun for the ckm paradigm are searches for cp violation in the b system .",
    "the detection of the expected large asymmetry in @xmath289 decays is of paramount importance , with the meausurement of the other angles in the unitarity triangle and of rare kaon decays providing eventually a more detailed picture . however , whether the ckm picture is ( essentially ) correct or not , it is also importat to mount experiments which may provide the first glimpse at * other * cp - violating phases , besides the ckm phase @xmath71 .",
    "of course , if the ckm picture is incorrect then one knows that at least some of these new phases are superweak in nature , arising in the @xmath84 ( and , perhaps , in the @xmath265 ) sectors .",
    "even if the ckm paradigm is essentially correct , there may be other phases which produce small violations in the fermion mixing matrix but which are important elsewhere .",
    "indeed , there are good theoretical arguments for having further cp - violating phases , besides the ckm phase @xmath71 .",
    "for instance , to establish a matter - antimatter asymmetry in the universe one needs to have processes which involve cp violation@xcite .",
    "if the origin of this asymmetry comes from processes at the gut scale , then , in general , the gut interactions contain further cp - violating phases besides the ckm phase @xmath290@xcite .",
    "if this asymmetry is established at the electroweak scale@xcite , then most likely one again needs further phases , both because intrafamily suppression gives not enough cp violation in the ckm case to generate the asymmetry and because one needs to have more than one higgs doublet@xcite .",
    "indeed this last point gives the fundamental reason why one should expect to have further cp - violating phases , besides the ckm phase @xmath71 .",
    "it is likely that the standard model is part of a larger theory .",
    "for instance , supersymmetric extensions of the sm have been much in vogue lately .",
    "any such extensions will introduce further particles and couplings and thus , by the simple corollary mentioned in the introduction , they will introduce new cp - violating phases .",
    "the best place to look for non - ckm phases is in processes where cp violation within the ckm paradigm is either vanishing or very suppressed .",
    "one such example is provided by experiments aimed at measuring the electric dipole moments of the neutron or the electron , since electric dipole moments are predicted to be extremely small in the ckm model .",
    "another example concerns measurements of the transverse muon polarization @xmath291 in @xmath2 decays , which vanishes in the ckm paradigm@xcite .",
    "the transverse muon polarization measures a t - violating triple correlation@xcite @xmath292 in as much as one can produce such an effect also as a result of final state interactions ( fsi ) this is not a totally clean test for new cp - violating phases . with",
    "two charged particles in the final state , like for the decay @xmath293 , one expects fsi to give typically @xmath294  @xcite .",
    "however , for the process @xmath295 with only one charged particle in the final state , the fsi effects should be much smaller .",
    "indeed , zhitnitski@xcite estimates for this proceses that @xmath296 .",
    "so a @xmath291 measurement in the @xmath297 decay is a good place to test for additional cp - violating phases .",
    "the transverse muon polarization @xmath291 is particularly sensitive to scalar interactions and thus is a good probe of cp - violating phases arising from the higgs sector@xcite .",
    "one can write the effective @xmath2 amplitude@xcite as @xmath298 then @xmath299 \\simeq 0.2~{\\rm im}~f_{\\rm s}~.\\ ] ] here @xmath300 are unit vectors along the muon ( neutrino ) directions and the numerical value represents the expectation after doing an average over phase space@xcite .",
    "contributions to @xmath301 can arise in multi - higgs models ( like the weinberg 3-higgs model@xcite ) from the charged higgs exchange shown in fig .",
    "5 , leading to @xcite @xmath302 here @xmath303 are constants associated with the charged higgs coupling to quarks ( leptons ) .",
    "because a leptonic vertex is involved , one in general does not have a strong constraint on @xmath304 . by examining possible non - standard contributions to the b semileptonic decay @xmath305",

    "for instance , for the weinberg 3 higgs model , one relates @xmath309 to a similar product of couplings of the charged higgs to quarks@xcite : @xmath310 where @xmath311 are the vev of the higgs doublets which couples to up - like quarks ( leptons ) .",

    ", @xmath301 arises from a complex phase associated with the gluino mass . assuming all supersymmetric masses are of the same order , christova and fabbrichesi@xcite arrive at the estimate @xmath316 where @xmath317 is the gluino mass cp - violating phase .",
    "this phase , however , is strongly restricted by the neutron electric dipole moment . typically , one finds@xcite @xmath318 ^ 2}\\ ] ] leading to a negligible contribution for @xmath291 , below the level of @xmath319 .",
    "an experiment ( e246 ) is presently underway at kek aimed at improving the bound on @xmath291 obtained earlier at brookhaven .",
    "the sensitivity of e246 is such that one should be able to achieve an error @xmath320@xcite .",
    "this level of precision is very interesting and , in some ways , it is comparable or better to @xmath53 measurements for probing cp - violating phases from the scalar sector .",
    "this is the case , for instance , in the weinberg model if @xmath321 is large . at any rate ,",
    "if a positive signal were to be found , it would be a clear indication for a non - ckm cp - violating phase .",
    "furthermore , as garisto@xcite has pointed out , a positive signal at the level aimed by the e246 experiment would imply very large effects in the corresponding decays in the b system involving @xmath322-leptons ( processes like @xmath323 ) , since one expects , roughly , @xmath324 thus , in principle , a very interesting experimental cross - check could be done .",
    "i would like to conclude more or less in the way in which i started this review , by reemphasizing that even after thirty years from the discovery of cp violation this phenomena remains shrouded in mystery . however , there are some grounds for optimism .",
    "it is quite possible that before the year 2000 we shall know whether the ckm model provides the approximately correct description of cp violation .",
    "for instance , a convincing non zero determination of @xmath325 would exclude the superweak hypothesis , while a meausurement of @xmath326 would strongly favor the ckm explanation .",
    "both of these experimental results could be on hand in this time frame",
    ".    a more detailed understanding of the full ckm structure , or a further understanding of cp violation if the ckm paradigm fails , will be more difficult .",
    "the meausurement of @xmath262 is probably the simplest of the more difficult things to accomplish .",
    "a direct meausurement of the ckm phase @xmath71 , or equivalently the angle @xmath235 , by means of experiments in the b sector or through the study of rare k decays , is very challenging .",
    "so are attempts at finding non ckm phases , although experiments searching for these effects are to be encouraged since they would signal new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "indeed , it is important also that other cp violation experiments where one expects very small effects in the standard model be pushed to their limits , as surprises may arise .",
    "a case in point is provided by searches for cp violation in charged k decays , or in @xmath327 decays , to be carried out here at daphne , where little is really known .",
    "it is unclear , however , whether all this experimental activity will be able to throw any light on the strong cp problem .",
    "nevertheless , if we are to really understand cp violation , one day we will have to understand why @xmath328 .",

    "<S> this review of cp violation focuses on the status of the subject and its likely future development through experiments in the kaon system and with b - decays . </S>",
    "<S> although present observations of cp violation are perfectly consistent with the ckm model , we discuss the theoretical and experimental difficulties which must be faced to establish this conclusively . in so doing , </S>",
    "<S> theoretical predictions and experimental prospects for detecting @xmath0 cp violation through measurements of @xmath1 and of rare k decays are reviewed . </S>",
    "<S> the crucial role that b cp - violating experiments will play in elucidating this issue is emphasized . </S>",
    "<S> the importance of looking for evidence for non - ckm cp - violating phases , through a search for a non - vanishing transverse muon polarization in @xmath2 decays , is also stressed . </S>"
