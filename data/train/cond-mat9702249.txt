    "scalar percolation is a simple model for disordered systems , and has received much attention in the last two decades  @xcite .",
    "this model describes the transmission of a scalar conserved quantity ( for example electric charge , or fluid mass ) across a randomly diluted system . however in the calculation of mechanical properties force ( i.e. a vector ) must be transmitted across the system  @xcite .",
    "it was originally suggested@xcite that the critical behavior of the elastic moduli of a percolating system should be equivalent to that of its conductivity , but this is only valid for the scalar limit of the born model of elasticity@xcite , a model which is not rotationally invariant and in many cases inappropriate .",
    "elastic percolation is not in general equivalent to scalar percolation .",
    "this was first made clear by the work of feng and sen@xcite , which showed that _ central - force elasticity _ percolation was in a different universality class than scalar percolation , and provided the starting point for a renewed interest in this problem .",
    "it soon became clear that the elasticity problem can be divided in two categories@xcite , according to the kind of forces which hold the lattice together .",
    "if angular forces are important@xcite , a singly - connected path across the lattice is enough to ensure rigidity , so any configuration of bonds which is connected is also rigid . in this case , the geometry of the elastic backbone is exactly the same as that of the scalar percolation problem @xcite .",
    "this is the case for bond - bending@xcite and beam@xcite models .",
    "thus , the elasticity percolation problem with angular forces is now well understood and that understanding has borrowed much from the _ geometrically equivalent _ scalar percolation problem .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to analyze the more challenging central - force rigidity percolation transition , stressing the similarities and differences between this problem and scalar percolation .",
    "if rigidity  @xcite is provided by central forces alone ( e.g. rotatable springs ) , single - connectedness is not enough to ensure rigidity . in this case",
    "a lattice that is conducting usually would not support an applied stress ( i.e. it would not be _ rigid _ ) .",
    "this was first shown by feng and sen  @xcite who found that the rigidity threshold is significantly larger than the conductivity threshold .",
    "an exception worth mentioning is the case of elastic lattices under tension , or equivalently , systems in which all springs have zero repose length  @xcite . for such systems ,",
    "conductivity and young modulus are _ equivalent _ , i.e. rigidity appears at the scalar percolation point .",
    "it has been recently emphasized  @xcite that entropic effects can give rise to similar effects in central - force systems with nonzero repose length and finite temperature , although the connection with ref .",
    "@xcite was not established .",
    "the main difficulties associated with central - force elasticity are as follows : whereas in the scalar connectivity case it is a trivial problem to determine when two sites belong to the same connected cluster , in the case of central - force rigidity it is not in general easy to decide whether two objects are rigidly connected .",
    "for example it takes some thinking to see that the six bodies in fig .",
    "[ fig : collapse ] form a rigid unit .",
    "thus it is not easy to see how a computer algorithm can be devised to identify rigid clusters .    in the scalar connectivity problem",
    ", the removal of a singly - connected bond leads to the separation of a connected cluster into two clusters . in the rigidity case , the removal of an analogous `` cutting bond '' may produce the collapse of a rigid cluster to a collection of an arbitrarily large number of smaller ones ( we call this the _ house - of - cards _ mechanism ) .",
    "[ fig : collapse ] shows a simple example of this situation . due to this fact",
    ", the transmission of rigidity can be `` non - local '' @xcite , since a bond added between two clusters on one side of the sample may induce rigidity between two clusters on the other side of a sample .",
    "a second source of difficulties in the problem of central - force rigidity is the existence of particular geometrical arrangements for which a system may fail to be rigid  @xcite even if it is rigid for most other cases@xcite .",
    "take for example two rigid bodies connected by three bars in two dimensions , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : degeneracy ] .",
    "this structure is in general rigid , but if the three bars happen to have a common point , then the structure is not rigid , since this common point is the center of relative rotations@xcite between the two bodies .",
    "particular geometrical arrangements ( such as fig .",
    "[ fig : degeneracy]b ) , which are non - rigid even when the structure is rigid for most other configurations , are called _",
    "degenerate configurations_. degenerate configurations appear with probability zero if the lattice locations are `` randomly chosen '' .",
    "a lattice is thus said to be _ generically rigid _",
    ", if it is rigid for most geometrical arrangements of its sites .",
    "generic rigidity only depends on the topology of the underlying graph , i.e. ignores the possibility of degeneracies .",
    "since degenerate configurations are always possible on perfectly regular lattices , we will assume our lattice sites to have small random displacements , in which case generic rigidity applies .",
    "up to recently , no simple algorithms existed for the determination of the rigid - cluster structure of arbitrary lattices . due to this , direct solving of the elastic equations was one of the few methods  @xcite available to obtain information on the structure of rigidly connected clusters .",
    "but this is very time - consuming and did not allow the study of large lattices .",
    "previous simulations were for example not sufficiently precise to confirm or reject the proposal@xcite that bond - bending and central - force elastic percolation might after all still be in the same universality class .",
    "this suggestion was not inconsistent with some numerical results obtained on small - sized systems@xcite .",
    "recently there has been a breakthrough in the system sizes accessible to numerical analysis@xcite , following the development of efficient graph - theoretic methods for the problem or generic rigidity in two dimensions@xcite .",
    "using such methods , we study the central - force rigidity percolation problem on randomly diluted triangular lattices of linear size up to @xmath12 , and connectivity percolation and body - joint rigidity percolation on site - diluted square lattices of size up to @xmath0 . our numerical algorithm  @xcite is complementary to the `` pebble game ''  @xcite , which is an implementation of hendrickson s matching algorithm in the original `` joint - bar '' representation of the network  @xcite(see below ) .",
    "this paper is an elaboration and extension of our two recent letters on this subject@xcite .",
    "we extend and elaborate upon the numerical data presented there in several ways : by comparing rigidity and connectivity percolation , by studying significantly larger lattices for rigidity percolation , by giving data on site and bond diluted lattices with a variety of boundary conditions ; by presenting results on a new body - joint model which is in the universality class of bar - and - joint rigidity percolation and ; by presenting detailed results for a model which continuously tunes between the braced square lattice ( which has a first order rigidity transition ) and the isotropic triangular lattice ( which has a second order rigidity transition ) .",
    "the numerical method is briefly described in section  [ sec : method ] . in section  [ sec : results ] , our results are presented and their implications discussed . a comparison is made with other available numerical and analytical results for the central - force rigidity percolation problem .",
    "we also discuss the issue of first - order rigidity , which has been the subject of a comment and reply in physical review letters@xcite .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] contains our conclusions .",
    "we take an initially depleted triangular lattice and add bonds ( in the bond - diluted case ) or sites ( in the site - diluted case ) to it one at a time , and use a graph - theoretic matching algorithm  @xcite in order to identify the rigid clusters that are formed in the system . for the case of bond dilution",
    ", @xmath11 is the density of present bonds , while in site dilution it indicates the density of present sites .",
    "in the site - diluted problem , a bond is present if the two sites it connects are .",
    "we use the body - bar version  @xcite of a recently proposed rigidity algorithm  @xcite .",
    "this algorithm , being combinatorial in nature , allows us to identify sets of sites which are rigidly connected , without providing any information on the actual values of the stresses when an external load is applied .",
    "the body - bar algorithm sees the lattice as a collection of rigid clusters ( or `` bodies '' ) connected by bars , instead of points connected by bars as proposed in the original algorithm@xcite and as implemented in the `` pebble game''@xcite .",
    "the body - bar representation allows a more efficient use of cpu and memory , as each rigid cluster is represented as one object .",
    "the matching identifies rigid clusters and _ condenses _ them to one node as new bonds are added to the network .    in two - dimensional rigidity ,",
    "a rigid cluster has @xmath13 degrees of freedom , while a point - like joint has @xmath14 .",
    "therefore the _ minimum _ number of bonds needed to rigidize @xmath15 joints in 2d is @xmath16 . matching algorithms  @xcite",
    "are based on this sort of constraint - counting .",
    "0.2 cm    the body - bar algorithm  @xcite , can be extended to handle `` rigidity problems '' with arbitrary values of @xmath17 ( number of degrees of freedom of a joint ) and @xmath18 ( degrees of freedom of a rigid cluster ) .",
    "connectivity for example , is just a special ( simple ) case of rigidity with @xmath19 and @xmath20 : the minimum number of bonds needed to connect @xmath15 points is @xmath21 in _ any _ dimension .",
    "connectivity percolation can thus be studied using this algorithm .",
    "more details on the application of matching algorithms for the specific case of connectivity percolation can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there are several ways to define the onset of global rigidity in a network  @xcite .",
    "we have used two distinct methods .",
    "first we determine whether an externally applied stress can be supported by the network , which we call applied stress ( as ) percolation .",
    "secondly we studied the percolation of internally - stressed ( is ) regions .    at the as _ percolation point _ , an applied stress is first able to be transmitted between the lower and upper sides of the sample .",
    "as we add bonds one at a time , we are able to exactly detect this percolation point by performing a simple test  @xcite which consists in connecting an additional fictitious spring between the upper and lower sides of the system .",
    "this auxiliary spring mimics the effect of an external load , and therefore the first time that a macroscopic rigid connection exists , a globally stressed region ( the backbone ) appears .",
    "the is critical point is defined as the bond- or site density at which internal stresses percolate through the system .",
    "this means that the upper and lower sides of the system belong to the same self - stressed cluster@xcite , and this is trivially detected within the matching algorithm@xcite . the as and is definitions of percolation are in principle different , but we found  @xcite that the average percolation threshold and the critical indices coincide for large lattices .",
    "similar definitions apply to the connectivity case , with the as case being the usual definition , i.e. the onset of electric conductivity , and is being percolation of `` eddy currents '' .",
    "we define the _ spanning cluster _",
    "[ fig : spcluster ] ) as the set of bonds that are rigidly connected to both sides of the sample .",
    "however only a subset of these bonds carry the applied load .",
    "this subset is called the _",
    "backbone_. the backbone will in general include some _ cutting bonds _",
    ", so named because the removal of any one of them leads to the loss of global load carrying capability .",
    "cutting bonds attain their maximum number exactly at @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the backbone bonds which are not cutting bonds are parts of internally overconstrained _",
    "blobs_. in the rigidity case , the smallest overconstrained cluster on a triangular lattice is the complete hexagonal wheel ( twelve bonds ) , while in the connectivity case it is a triangle ( i.e. the smallest possible _ loop _ ) .",
    "the spanning cluster also contains bonds which are rigidly connected to both ends of the sample but which do not carry any of the applied load .",
    "these are called _ dangling ends_. this classification is standard in connectivity ( scalar ) percolation  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we analyze several other boundary conditions , particularly in the generic rigidity case on triangular lattice . in that case , for site dilution we analyze : as with rigid bus - bars at the ends of the sample , as without bus bars ( any - pair rigidity ) , and is with bus - bars . for bond dilution , only the as with bus - bars case was studied .",
    "we determine the exact percolation point ( as or is ) for each sample , so we can identify and measure the different components of the spanning cluster _ exactly _ at @xmath4 for each sample .",
    "this should be contrasted with usual numerical approaches , in which averages are done at fixed values of @xmath11 , and @xmath22 is obtained from finite - size scaling ( e.g. data collapse ) . in that case",
    ", it is known that slight differences in the estimation of @xmath22 can lead to important deviations in critical indices  @xcite .",
    "this source of error is absent in our measurements .",
    "sample averages are done over approximately @xmath23 samples .",
    "we first analyze the size dependence of the three key probabilities @xmath2 , the backbone density , @xmath3 , the dangling end density and @xmath24 , the infinite cluster density , _ exactly at their percolation thresholds _ as described in the previous section . in fig .",
    "[ fig : components - all]a - c , this data is presented for the three different universality classes in figs .",
    "[ fig : spcluster]a - c .",
    "case c corresponds to the generic braced square net ( gbsn ) , which is a square lattice to which diagonals are added at random with probability @xmath11 .",
    "the non - generic version of this problem has been studied by many authors  @xcite , and it is well known that the number of diagonals needed to rigidize it is not extensive : @xmath25 when @xmath26 . this is confirmed by our numerical simulations , which correspond to the bus - bar boundary condition .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : components - all]d we also present data for the rigidity case @xmath27 on a square lattice , to further test whether the rigidity class is universal in two dimensions . in this model",
    "each site of a square lattice is a body and so has @xmath28 degrees of freedom .",
    "each of these bodies is connected to each adjacent body by two bonds or bars , i.e. two contiguous bodies are pinned at a common point .",
    "maxwell counting  @xcite then implies , so that the maxwell estimate of the bond percolation threshold is @xmath29 .",
    "our numerical estimate is @xmath30 , thus confirming the accuracy of the maxwell approximation .    one clear feature of fig .",
    "[ fig : components - all ] is that the bsn ( fig .",
    "[ fig : components - all]c ) has a qualitatively different behavior than the other cases",
    ". for the bsn , @xmath2 , @xmath1 and @xmath3 all have a finite density at large @xmath31 , indicating that the rigidity transition is first order in this case .",
    "in contrast , in both the connectivity(fig .  [",
    "fig : components - all]a ) and rigidity cases ( figs . [",
    "fig : components - all]b , d ) , @xmath2 and @xmath24 are decreasing in a power law fashion over the available size ranges",
    ". however the behavior of @xmath3 is more complex .",
    "first we discuss the behavior of @xmath2 .    at a second order phase transition ,",
    "finite - size scaling theory predicts @xmath32 .",
    "taking into account correction - to - scaling terms , which we assume to be power - law , we may generally write    @xmath33    this expression is fitted to our numerical data by choosing the set of parameters @xmath34 that minimize the error    @xmath35    a plot of @xmath36 vs. @xmath37 should then have an asymptotic ( @xmath38 ) intercept equal to the leading exponent @xmath39 .",
    "similar fitting procedures were used to produce figures  [ fig : betaestimate ] and [ fig : nuestimate ] , where the leading exponent is @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively .",
    "a fit of the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : components - all]b , d produces a rather universal estimate @xmath42 . in consequence",
    "the rigid backbone is _ fractal _ at @xmath4 , with a fractal dimension @xmath43 . in the connectivity case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : components - all]a ) , we find  @xcite @xmath44 , or @xmath45 , which is consistent with the most precise prior work  @xcite .",
    "now we consider @xmath24 and @xmath3 . in the connectivity case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : components - all]a ) , an analysis of the dangling ends and infinite cluster probabilities ( fig .",
    "[ fig : betaestimate]a ) both lead to the estimate @xmath46 , in agreement with the exact result 5/48 . in the rigidity case however , there are strong finite size effects and even at sizes of @xmath12 ( joint - bar rigidity , fig  [ fig : components - all]b ) , and @xmath0 ( body - joint rigidity , fig .",
    "[ fig : components - all]d , it looks as though the dangling probability may be saturating , while the infinite cluster density continues to decrease . since @xmath47",
    ", it is expected that asymptotically @xmath24 and @xmath3 must behave in the same manner .    clearly the numerical results for the range of system sizes currently available are still controlled by finite size effects , and the results depend on the analysis method chosen",

    "a fit to the @xmath24 data of fig .",
    "[ fig : components - all]b , d yields @xmath48 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : betaestimate]b , c ) in agreement with jacobs and thorpe . but a similar fit of the dangling end density gives @xmath49 for the joint - bar rigidity case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : betaestimate]b ) and @xmath50 for the body - joint rigidity case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : betaestimate]c ) . in our previous work@xcite",
    "we were guided by the cayley tree results  @xcite which indicated a first order jump in the infinite cluster probability .",
    "we thus chose to interpret fig .",
    "[ fig : components - all]b , d as indicating a saturation of the infinite cluster probability at the dangling end value of about @xmath51 .",
    "having extended our data from @xmath52 to @xmath0 , it now looks more likely that a small value of @xmath53 occurs in the rigidity case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : betaestimate]b , c ) , though much larger simulation sizes are required to find @xmath40 precisely .    due to the slow finite size effects found in the analysis of the infinite cluster and dangling end probabilities , it is natural to be concerned about the effect of boundary conditions and other , usually non - universal , parameters on the observed results . for generic joint - bar rigidity case on triangular lattices",
    "we thus tested a variety of different boundary conditions for both site and bond dilution .",
    "this data is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : all - rig - cases ] , from which it is seen that the conclusions drawn from the case of rigidity percolation with applied bus bars are quite robust .    finally , the behavior of the dangling end density as a function of @xmath11 is also quite striking .",
    "this data is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : blue_vsp ] . at very high @xmath11 ,",
    "nearly all bonds belong to the backbone , so the dangling end density approaches zero .",
    "below @xmath4 , there is no infinite cluster , so there are again no dangling ends .",
    "there then must be a maximum in the density of dangling ends between @xmath4 and @xmath54 .",
    "as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : blue_vsp ] , the interesting feature is the abrupt drop in the dangling density at @xmath4 , a feature that appears to become more pronounced with increasing sample size .",
    "it is tempting to interpret this as definitive evidence of a first order rigidity transition , but it is also consistent with the strong finite size effects seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : components - all]b , d and fig .",
    "6 , so we must await large lattice simulations for a definitive analysis .",
    "now we turn to the calculation of the correlation length exponent for rigidity percolation . when there is a second - order rigidity transition , there is a diverging correlation length @xmath55 .",
    "we can find the exponent @xmath56 of this divergence by measuring the sample - to - sample fluctuations in @xmath4 as a function of @xmath31 .",
    "the dispersion , and according to finite - size - scaling @xmath57 .",
    "an asymptotic analysis for @xmath58 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nuestimate]a for connectivity percolation , in [ fig : nuestimate]b for joint - bar rigidity and in [ fig : nuestimate]c for body - joint rigidity . from these figures",
    "we estimate @xmath59 ( the exact value is @xmath60 ) for connectivity percolation and @xmath61 for rigidity percolation .",
    "this provides further strong evidence that rigidity percolation is second order in two dimensions , though _ not _ in the same universality class as scalar percolation . in the case of the first order rigidity on the braced square net ( fig .",
    "[ fig : compare]c ) , the variations in @xmath4 behave as @xmath62 , in accordance with analytical results for this model  @xcite .",
    "our algorithm also identifies the cutting ( also called _ red _ or critical ) bonds at the percolation point , for the case of as percolation .",
    "the number @xmath63 of red bonds scales at @xmath4 as @xmath64 .",
    "coniglio  @xcite has shown that @xmath65 exactly , for _ scalar percolation_. numerical evidence suggesting that @xmath65 also in rigidity percolation was first presented in  @xcite .",
    "it is in fact possible to extend coniglio s reasoning to the case of central - force rigidity percolation  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that @xmath66 has to be rigorously satisfied also in this case , and therefore @xmath58 and @xmath67 must have the same slope in a log - log plot .",
    "analysis of the number of cutting bonds is also presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : nuestimate ] , and yields values of @xmath41 consistent with the analysis of variations in percolation thresholds described in the previous paragraph .",
    "since the cayley tree model  @xcite gives behavior quite similar to the braced square net  @xcite , i.e. a first - order rigidity transition , it is interesting to ask whether the rigidity transition is `` usually '' like that on the braced square net ( i.e. first order ) , or whether the second order transition found on triangular lattices is more typical . in order to probe this issue",
    ", we analyze a model which interpolates between the braced square net and the triangular lattice . in the braced square net ,",
    "the random diagonals are present with probability @xmath68 , to make the lattice rigid it is sufficient ( though not necessary ) to add one diagonal to every row of the square lattice .",
    "the probability that a spanning cluster exists is then , from which we find @xmath69 .",
    "we generalize this model by randomly adding the diagonals ( with probability @xmath68 ) to a square lattice whose bonds have been diluted with probability @xmath70 .",
    "the braced square net is @xmath71 , while if @xmath72 this model is equivalent to the bond - diluted triangular lattice .",
    "typical results for various values of @xmath70 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : compare ] .",
    "it is seen that even for a small amount of dilution of the square lattice , e.g. @xmath73 , the rigidity transition returns to the behavior characteristic of the homogeneously diluted triangular case ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : compare ] ) .",
    "we find that for sufficiently large lattice sizes , the universal behavior found in the other rigidity cases holds for any finite @xmath74 ( for larger values of @xmath70 it is not possible to rigidize the lattice by randomly adding diagonals ) , and we suggest that the `` fully - first - order '' transition ( i.e. a first - order backbone ) only occurs in the special case of a perfect ( undiluted ) square lattice .",
    "we have compared three types of percolation transition in two dimensions : the connectivity transition and ; the generic rigidity transition on the triangular lattice and ; the generic rigidity transition on the braced square lattice .",
    "a summary of our understanding is as follows : ( i ) the generic rigidity transition on triangular lattices is second order with @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and ; ( ii ) the rigidity transition on the braced square net is first order with finite backbone , spanning cluster and cutting bond densities at the percolation threshold .",
    "only the value of @xmath53 for the generic rigidity transition on triangular lattices remains controversial , due to the very strong finite size effects in that case .",
    "assume that the backbone mass@xcite scales as @xmath78 at @xmath4 . if the backbone is compact then @xmath79 , the dimension of the system .",
    "the backbone mass is composed of red ( or cutting ) bonds plus `` blobs '' of overconstrained , or self - stressed bonds ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : spcluster ] ) .",
    "therefore @xmath80 .",
    "the number of red bonds in the backbone scales as @xmath81 , as analytical results  @xcite and the simulations reported here show .",
    "let us furthermore write @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the number of blobs in the backbone , and @xmath84 be the average number of bonds in a blob . therefore .",
    "now , the as backbone is an _ exactly isostatic _ body - bar structure , formed by rigid clusters ( blobs ) joined by bars ( red bonds ) so that counting of degrees of freedom is exact on it and so @xmath85  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath86 is the number of sites in the backbone , that do not belong to a blob ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spcluster ] ) .",
    "this identity is known as laman s condition@xcite , and results from the fact that each red bond acts as a bar and therefore restricts one degree of freedom , while each blob has three degrees of freedom and isolated sites have two .",
    "the backbone is a rigid cluster and therefore has three overall degrees of freedom .",
    "we do not need to know @xmath86 for our argument .",
    "it is enough to notice that @xmath87 .",
    "we can thus write      to this point , we have made no assumption about the character ( compact or fractal ) of the backbone , so it is valid in general .",
    "if the transition is second - order , there is a divergent length ( for example , the size of rigid clusters ) , and we expect @xmath84 to diverge with system size .",
    "therefore a non - trivial value results for @xmath89 , as we find numerically .",
    "if on the other hand there is no diverging length in the system , then @xmath90 constant for large systems and @xmath91 exactly .",
    "we thus see that a compact backbone requires an extensive number of cutting bonds , and this in turn can only be satisfied if @xmath92 exactly@xcite .",
    "this is completely inconsistent with our data , and so the possibility of a first order backbone is remote in two dimensions .    the first order rigidity transition exhibited by the braced square net seems to be atypical as we illustrated using a model which tunes continuously from that limit toward the generic triangular lattice .",
    "we found that even a small deviation from the braced square lattice limit leads to a behavior similar to that of the triangular lattice",
    ". it would be intriguing if there were a tricritical point at which first order rigidity ceases and second order rigidity sets in , but we have not found a model which exhibits that behavior .",
    "nevertheless there are a large number of other rigidity models in two dimensions , so the possibility is not yet ruled out .    c.  m. acknowledges financial support of cnpq and faperj , brazil .",
