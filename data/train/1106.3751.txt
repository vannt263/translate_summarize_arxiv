    "recently , the coupled resonator array has been suggested as another promising candidate for building a quantum simulator @xcite .",
    "compared to other structures , the coupled resonator array can be used to study the quantum phase transition of light and has the striking advantage of full addressability of individual sites .    since the idea of realizing strongly correlated states of light in coupled resonator arrays was first proposed in the seminal papers @xcite , a large amount of work has been devoted to a systematic study of the light phase in the total parameter space @xcite . the phase boundary between the mott insulator ( mi ) phase and the superfluid ( sf )",

    ", recent work by several groups has promoted the quantum phase transition of light to a nonequilibrium case @xcite .    despite the plentiful and substantial achievements in the theoretical aspect , there have not yet been any experimental realizations of coupled resonator arrays . for an experimental exploration of the quantum phase transition of light using coupled resonator arrays",
    ", we should have the abilities of preparing the total system in its ground state , tuning the effective photon repulsion and the photon hopping rate over a wide range of values , and obtaining the accurate statistical property of the excitations in each resonator .",
    "up to now , previous work has just provided some primitive hints toward possible realizations of the model @xcite .",
    "the authors in refs .",
    "@xcite suggested measuring the individual resonator via mapping the excitations onto the atomic levels followed by state selective resonance fluorescence , but this method still suffers from the current lack of high - efficiency photon detectors .",
    "moreover , the photon hopping rate is typically fixed by the fabrication process and can not be changed post - creation , which limits the study of quantum phase transition of light in a complete parameter space .    in this paper , we propose an alternative experimental scheme which does not suffer from the above limitations . for our version of the coupled resonator array , each superconducting transmission line resonator ( tlr )",
    "contains a charge qubit as the nonlinear element and the adjacent resonators are coupled by another charge qubit playing the role of an effective knob for the photon hopping rate .",

    "<S> the on - site interaction and the photon hopping rate can be tuned independently by adjusting the transition frequencies of the charge qubits inside the resonators and at the resonator junctions , respectively , which permits us to systematically study the quantum phase transition of light in a complete parameter space . by combining the techniques of photon - number - dependent qubit transition and </S>",

    "<S> an analysis of the various decoherence sources and disorders shows that our scheme can serve as a guide to coming experiments involving a small number of coupled resonators . </S>"
