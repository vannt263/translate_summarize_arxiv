    "in the context of quantum scattering inverse problems , not much is known about coupled - channel problems with threshold differences , i.e. , inelastic problems ( see paragraph ix.4 of @xcite and references therein ) . though well - known single - channel methods based on the marchenko or gelfand - levitan approaches have been generalized to these coupled - channel problems ,",
    "no sufficiently simple method for inverting experimental data has been deduced from these generalizations . this may be explained by the fact that in its general form the method requires knowing the whole set of scattering data and , in particular , the whole scattering ( s ) matrix should be known , whereas only the open - channel submatrix is accessible from experimental data .",
    "another reason is related with the complicated character of the gelfand - levitan - marchenko equation which in this case was solved only numerically @xcite . in the one channel case the second difficulty was overcome with the help of the supersymmetric quantum mechanics ( susy qm ) approach ( see e.g.   @xcite ) which is equivalent to the gelfand - levitan - marchenko method when the kernel of the integral equation is degenerate @xcite .",
    "moreover , when applied to the zero initial potential , these transformations lead to exactly - solvable potentials with scattering matrices being arbitrary - order rational functions of the wave number and hence providing excellent fits of experimental data @xcite . until recently , however , generalizing such supersymmetric transformations of the zero potential to inelastic coupled - channel problems seemed to be impossible as a matter of principle @xcite .",
    "thus , experimental data with coupling did not seem accessible to this method .",
    "fortunately , as it was recently announced @xcite , this strong limitation is explained by an unnecessary condition imposed on transformation functions used up to now .",
    "usual supersymmetric transformations @xcite can be described in terms of transformation operators relating solutions of two sturm - liouville problems , and hence keeping boundary conditions unchanged ; this is why we call them  conservative \" .",
    "changes in the spectrum due to such transformations may correspond only to elements from the kernel of either the transformation operator or its adjoint form .",
    "this is just the reason why the spectrum of two supersymmetric partners may differ only by a finite number of levels .",
    "although the existence of transformations of another kind , breaking boundary conditions , is known for some time ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , their use in the single - channel case has been limited to a very specific application @xcite , where usual transformations happen to be sufficient . in the inelastic coupled - channel case , on the contrary , these  non - conservative \" transformations seem to be of fundamental importance as they lead to exactly - solvable potential models with non - trivially coupled @xmath0-matrices .",
    "we hope that these new transformations may become a keystone for an inversion procedure both simple enough for practical realization and accurate enough to fit experimental data with a good precision .",
    "this renewal of interest for supersymmetric transformations of inelastic coupled - channel problems implies that a general study of their properties is necessary . in particular , the jost - matrix transformation ,",
    "from which the transformed s - matrix can be deduced , should be known in the general case . in @xcite , it is shown that the jost - matrix modification depends on the value of the superpotential matrix @xmath1 at infinity , which in turn depends on the asymptotic behaviour of the factorization solution . in the single - channel case",
    ", @xmath2 is a positive ( resp .",
    "negative ) real number when the factorization solution increases ( resp .",
    "decreases ) at infinity . in the coupled - channel case , @xmath1 is a matrix and its asymptotic behaviour is much more complicated . the main goal of the present work is to study carefully this behaviour .",
    "section 2 reviews definitions from multichannel scattering theory . as an introduction to section 3 we first review briefly general properties of multichannel supersymmetric transformations and then we analyze the maximal number of arbitrary parameters entering into the superpotential and as a result into the transformed potential . next we discuss in a detailed way the superpotential asymptotic behaviour proving our main theorem and",
    "give a closed expression for the transformed jost solution and jost function .",
    "in section 4 we derive a general form of the superpotential which is a susy partner of the zero potential .",
    "section 5 illustrates these findings by examples and comparisons with existing results from the literature .",
    "section 6 contains conclusions and perspectives .",
    "let us first define our notation and briefly recall some notions of scattering theory @xcite used below .",
    "we consider a multichannel radial schrdinger equation that reads in reduced units @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the radial coordinate , @xmath5 is an @xmath6 real symmetric matrix , and @xmath7 may be either a matrix - valued or a vector - valued solution . by @xmath8",
    "we denote either a point in the space @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 such that @xmath12 , or a diagonal matrix with the non - vanishing entries @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "the complex wave numbers @xmath13 are related to the center - of - mass energy @xmath15 and the channel thresholds @xmath16 , which are supposed to be different from each other , by @xmath17 we do not assume a fixed order of channels since any necessary order can be achieved by a suitable permutation of the rows in the schrdinger equation . for simplicity we will limit ourselves to unequal thresholds here and defer the general study of equal and unequal thresholds to a future work .",
    "we will also assume potential @xmath5 to be short - ranged at infinity , i.e. , there exists an @xmath18 such that @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 are entries of matrix @xmath5 .",
    "under such assumptions , the schrdinger equation has two @xmath6 matrix - valued solutions @xmath22 ( jost solutions ) such that @xmath23.\\ ] ] the columns of these matrices form a basis in the @xmath24-dimensional solution space of the schrdinger equation with a given value of @xmath15 . in general",
    ", these solutions are complex and satisfy the symmetry property @xmath25 , where asterisk denotes complex conjugation ; for real energies below all thresholds , @xmath26 and the jost solutions are real .",
    "next we define the regular solution @xmath27 and the irregular solution @xmath28 by their behaviour at the origin . for the sake of simplicity , we limit ourselves to bounded @xmath29-wave potentials , in which case these solutions satisfy @xmath30 where prime means derivation with respect to @xmath4 and @xmath31 denotes the identity matrix .",
    "this definition shows that the columns of these matrices also form a basis in the solution space of the schrdinger equation . in terms of the jost solutions , these solutions",

    "the jost matrix defines both scattering and bound states properties .",
    "the scattering matrix , which is symmetric , reads @xmath46^t f^t(-k)k^{-1/2}.\\ ] ] bound - state energies , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , correspond to zeros of the determinant of the jost function , @xmath49 , such that @xmath50 , @xmath51 with @xmath52 , @xmath53 below all thresholds . for potentials satisfying the above assumptions ,",
    "the number @xmath54 of bound states is finite .",
    "according to the multichannel susy approach @xcite , applying the transformation operator @xmath55 to solutions @xmath56 of leads to solutions @xmath57 of the new equation @xmath58 where @xmath59 , like @xmath5 , is supposed to be a real , short - ranged , bounded and symmetric @xmath6 matrix and @xmath60 , like @xmath7 , may be either a matrix - valued or a vector - valued function . the matrix - valued function @xmath61 ( usually called superpotential ) is expressed in terms of a matrix - valued solution of at a fixed value of @xmath62 below all thresholds ( this parameter is known as the factorization constant ) , which we denote @xmath63 and call transformation function or factorization solution . defining the corresponding wave number diagonal matrix @xmath64 by its positive elements @xmath65 , one has @xmath66 and @xmath67 then for @xmath68 one has @xmath69 the specific form , of the transformation operator @xmath70 results in the potential @xmath71 from being of the form @xmath72 to have a real and symmetric potential we restrict @xmath63 to be real and such that its self - wronksian vanishes , @xmath73 .",
    "for @xmath62 a particular solution of is @xmath74 other solutions @xmath60 corresponding to the same @xmath75 may be found as usual from the property @xmath76 , which gives @xmath77    the conventional susy transformations have the property that if @xmath78 then @xmath79 which requires some additional limitation on the transformation function @xmath80 .",
    "following @xcite rejecting this limitation leads to loosing this property of the transformation operator @xmath70 .",
    "such transformation operators violate the vanishing behaviour of the solution at the origin and we call them  non - conservative \" .",
    "nevertheless , since @xmath70 transforms solutions of the initial differential equation into solutions of the transformed equation the full information about the new hamiltonian @xmath81 is accessible . in particular its",
    "jost function and @xmath0-matrix can be constructed explicitly . below we will concentrate our attention mainly on non - conservative transformations although our main result ( theorem [ th : uinf ] in section [ smain ] ) is valid for the general case .",
    "first we discuss the general form of the transformation function @xmath63 introduced in the previous section .",
    "we notice that the general vector - valued solution of the schrdinger equation contains @xmath24 integration constants and can always be presented as a linear combination of @xmath24 fixed linearly independent solutions . in general ,",
    "transformation function @xmath63 may be composed of @xmath39 such solutions",
    ". therefore it may contain @xmath82 arbitrary parameters at most .",
    "but as far as the new potential is concerned there is a big redundancy between these parameters . indeed , because of the specific form of the superpotential a multiplication of the transformation function @xmath63 on the right by a non - singular constant matrix does not affect the superpotential .",
    "a minimal set of arbitrary parameters is given by    [ th1 ] given the initial potential @xmath83 , fixed thresholds and factorization energy , the most general transformed potential @xmath84 is completely determined by the value @xmath85 of the symmetric superpotential matrix at the origin .",
    "it is calculated by formulas and where @xmath86 and contains @xmath87 arbitrary real parameters which are the entries of matrix @xmath85 .",
    "the general matrix - valued solution of the schrdinger equation @xmath88 with real matrices @xmath89 and @xmath90 produces the most general real superpotential and , hence , potential .",
    "definitions and then imply that @xmath91 vanishes if and only if matrix @xmath89 is singular . in this case",
    "@xmath92 is not invertible and the superpotential and hence the transformed potential @xmath71 become singular at the origin ; as stated above , we want to avoid this case here and therefore we impose the condition @xmath93 .",
    "it is now clear that in this case matrix @xmath89 does not affect the superpotential @xmath61 as given in since we can multiply by @xmath94 on the right , which leaves the superpotential unaffected or , equivalently without loosing generality , put @xmath95 .",
    "the superpotential @xmath61 and hence the transformed potential @xmath71 thus only depend on the @xmath96 parameters appearing in @xmath90 .",
    "this simplified writing allows us to express easily the other condition imposed on the real transformation function , namely the symmetry of @xmath61 and @xmath71 .",
    "as mentioned above , this happens when @xmath73 , which gives @xmath97 equations for the elements of matrix @xmath90 .",
    "the value of this wronskian being @xmath4-independent , can be used to calculate it at the origin with and which leads to @xmath98=d_1-d_1^t=0 . \\label{symor}\\ ] ] the superpotential and transformed potential are thus symmetric when @xmath90 is chosen symmetric .",
    "this can also be checked on the value of the superpotential at the origin which reads , according to , , and , @xmath99 .    to calculate the jost matrix for the transformed potential according to",
    "we need to know its jost solution which is defined by the asymptotic behaviour .",
    "usually a supersymmetry transformation changes this behaviour .",
    "so we have to analyze the asymptotic behaviour of the function @xmath100 which is mainly defined by the asymptotics of superpotential @xmath1 .      according to , the asymptotic behaviour of the superpotential depends on the asymptotic behaviour of the factorization solution .",
    "this time , in place of , we choose to write the factorization solution as @xmath101 with @xmath102 and @xmath103 being some constant matrices ; factor @xmath104 is introduced for further convenience .",
    "we notice that matrices @xmath102 and @xmath103 should satisfy the condition @xmath105 following from the symmetry property of the superpotential @xmath106=0 $ ] .",
    "we show below that the asymptotic behaviour of the superpotential crucially depends on the structure of matrix @xmath102 .",
    "in particular , it depends on the rank of @xmath102 and if rank@xmath107 it depends on an interrelation between the values of thresholds and linear dependence between rows of @xmath102 .",
    "this interrelation becomes more transparent for a specific order of channels .",
    "therefore before going further we will first rearrange the channels taking into account the structure of matrix @xmath102 .",
    "our main aim in this reordering is to collect together both all linearly independent rows of matrix @xmath102 and its linearly independent columns .",
    "as it was already noticed changing channels corresponds to going to another starting hamiltonian .",
    "but evidently it corresponds to the same physical system after the reordering .",
    "the permutation of columns simultaneously both in @xmath102 and in @xmath103 is equivalent to a multiplication on the right of the whole factorization solution @xmath63 by a constant non - singular matrix which evidently does not change the superpotential @xmath61 as given by .",
    "we rearrange the rows of @xmath102 together with the corresponding channels in the following way .",
    "the first channel with wavenumber @xmath108 and , hence , the first row of the reordered matrix ( we denote @xmath109 ) correspond to the largest threshold related to a non - vanishing row of @xmath102 . the second channel with wavenumber @xmath110 and , hence , the second row of the new matrix @xmath109 correspond to the largest remaining threshold related to a row of @xmath102 linearly independent of the first row of @xmath102 .",
    "at each next step @xmath111 , a new channel with wavenumber @xmath112 and row @xmath113 of @xmath109 corresponds to the largest remaining threshold related to a row of @xmath102 linearly independent of the previous rows of @xmath109 .",
    "the reordering ends when the first @xmath114 rows of @xmath109 become linearly independent .",
    "all remaining rows of @xmath102 are transferred to @xmath109 without changes .",
    "as mentioned above we now permute columns in @xmath109 to have its upper left @xmath115 block non - singular thus obtaining matrix @xmath116 .",
    "matrix @xmath103 after all these permutations is transformed into @xmath117 .",
    "the diagonal wavenumber matrix is written as @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the @xmath120 diagonal block after the reordering and @xmath121 is the @xmath122 diagonal block containing the remaining wavenumbers .",
    "such a structure of @xmath116 , @xmath117 and wavenumber matrices will be assumed till the end of the paper .",
    "now we can formulate our main theorem .",

    "in contrast , figures [ fig : cox1 ] ( b ) and [ fig : cox2 ] ( b ) show that this choice does not strongly affect the scattering matrix , which always displays a feshbach resonance at an energy of about 6.3 and a large negative slope of @xmath252 at zero energy and of @xmath251 above threshold . the eigenphase shifts and mixing parameter are only a bit smaller in figure [ fig : cox2 ] ( b ) than in figure [ fig : cox1 ] ( b ) .      in the previous @xmath261 example , matrix @xmath116 has rank 2 .",
    "let us now consider the case , not allowed in @xcite , where rank @xmath116 is 1 .",
    "our supersymmetric formalism , on the contrary , is also valid in this case . both matrices @xmath132 and @xmath130 defined in lemma [ lem : ccanon ] are numbers , @xmath262 , @xmath263 , so that @xmath264 and @xmath265 . choosing @xmath266 and @xmath267 we get from @xmath268 with @xmath269 it is not difficult to check the condition rank @xmath204 ( cf . ) @xmath270 where @xmath271 and @xmath272 .",
    "we notice that our approach permits us to calculate the superpotential by the same formulas and as in the previous section but now the parameters are not independent anymore , they should satisfy condition . with the identification @xmath273 and @xmath274 this leads to an exactly - solvable model used in @xcite to construct an analytical model for the feshbach - resonance phenomenon .",
    "theorem [ th1 ] implies that @xmath275 which is clearly seen from .",
    "the value @xmath85 is given by the same formula with the replacement @xmath276 and @xmath277 . therefore applying proposition [ prop1 ] one gets the jost matrix @xmath278 -\\frac{\\beta}{\\kappa_2+\\rmi k_2 } & -\\frac{\\alpha_2-\\rmi k_2}{\\kappa_2+\\rmi k_2 } \\end{array } \\right)\\ ] ] which differs from because of the different asymptotic form of the superpotential at infinity .",
    "let us now construct an explicit example that illustrates the strong impact of @xmath2 on the scattering matrix . in figure",
    "[ fig : gcox1 ] , a potential is constructed with the same parameters as in figures [ fig : cox1 ] and [ fig : cox2 ] , except for the factorization wave number which is now chosen in order to satisfy condition ( [ condaa ] ) , @xmath279 when @xmath280 is smaller than this limit , the potential becomes singular , a case we want to avoid here .",
    "figures [ fig : cox1 ] ( a ) , [ fig : cox2 ] ( a ) and [ fig : gcox1 ] ( a ) show that when @xmath280 approaches this limit value from above , the well in potential @xmath281 goes to infinity and finally disappears when @xmath280 actually reaches the limit value .",
    "as long as @xmath282 , this well movement in @xmath281 has practically no impact on the scattering matrix : the potentials are nearly phase equivalent with each other .",
    "in contrast , when the well disappears , a strong change of behaviour is observed , as seen in figure [ fig : gcox1 ] ( b ) : while the feshbach resonance still keeps the same energy and width , the slope of @xmath252 at zero energy becomes small and positive .",
    "above threshold , @xmath252 has now a value very close to @xmath251 of figures [ fig : cox1 ] ( b ) and [ fig : cox2 ] ( b ) , with a large negative slope .",
    "though @xmath252 is continuous at threshold , it now has a strong cusp effect .",
    "the mixing parameter , which was close to zero , now gets close to @xmath283 , while @xmath251 gets very small .",
    "the rank of @xmath116 , and hence @xmath2 , thus have a strong qualitative effect on the scattering matrix , which displays very different behaviours in both cases ; for practical applications , e.g.  for fitting actual scattering data with such potentials , both behaviours might be of interest .",
    "let us finally remark that the behaviour @xmath275 agrees with the result obtained in @xcite for @xmath261 in the context of a bound - state removal by supersymmetric quantum mechanics .",
    "there , the factorization matrix solution is made of one increasing and one decreasing vector solution at infinity , which corresponds to rank @xmath116 = 1 . in @xcite ,",
    "this result is even generalized to @xmath39 channels and a diagonal matrix for @xmath2 is found , with all positive elements but one , corresponding to the channel with the lowest threshold .",
    "however , the general situation is more complicated , as described by our theorem [ th : uinf ] : there may be more than one negative element in the asymptotic form of the superpotential and the lowest channel may correspond to a positive asymptotic entry of the superpotential . this possibility is illustrated by our last example .",
    "here we choose @xmath285 , rank @xmath232 so that matrix @xmath132 is the row @xmath286 .",
    "such a choice of @xmath132 reflects the fact that the third row of @xmath116 is proportional to its first row ( see ) .",
    "the adopted order of thresholds corresponds to @xmath287 and @xmath288 . for simplicity only ( equal )",
    "off - diagonal entries of @xmath289 matrix @xmath130 from proposition [ prop1 ] are chosen different of zero which we denote @xmath290 . then applying we obtain @xmath291 where @xmath292 , @xmath293 , @xmath294 .",
    "the condition @xmath295 @xmath296 is satisfied if @xmath297 .",
    "it is clearly seen here that at @xmath298 both @xmath299 and @xmath300 vanish and the asymptotic form of @xmath61 , @xmath301 , agrees with theorem [ th : uinf ] .",
    "in conclusion , supersymmetric quantum mechanics is a promising tool to pragmatically solve the inelastic coupled - channel inverse problem , thanks to its ability to construct sophisticated exactly - solvable models .",
    "the present work is only a starting point to the general study of supersymmetric transformations in the multichannel case : by focusing on the asymptotic behaviour of the superpotential , it reveals the richness of possible behaviours , as compared with the single - channel case .    we have made a rigorous study of this asymptotic behaviour for a general supersymmetric transformation .",
    "our theorem generalizes a result found in the literature @xcite : there may be several negative elements in the asymptotic form of the superpotential and the lowest threshold may produce either a positive ( as shown explicitly by our example [ ex3 ] ) or a negative entry .    as a byproduct of our proof",
    ", we have been able to construct exactly - solvable potentials that are supersymmetric partners of the zero potential .",
    "essential simplifications occur when each element of the factorization matrix solution is either an increasing or a decreasing exponential ( not a linear combination of both types ) .",
    "explicit examples have been given for two and three channels .",
    "future work should focus on both the behaviour of the superpotential at the origin and at infinity in the general case : arbitrary number of channels , with equal and/or different thresholds , and arbitrary rank for the matrices multiplying the regular and singular solutions in the factorization matrix solution . on the other hand , iterations of coupled - channel supersymmetric transformations",
    "should be studied , which should eventually lead to a satisfactory solution of the coupled - channel inverse problem , with and without threshold difference .",
    "we acknowledge useful discussions with franois foucart and andrey pupasov , at the beginning and at the end of this work respectively .",
