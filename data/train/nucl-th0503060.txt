    "<S> other analysis of the star data @xcite are also in support of our result . </S>",
    "<S> the large factor of 3 around @xmath35 gev / c would be hard to attain by the medium modification of the fragmentation function , if fragmentation is considered instead of recombination for hadronization .    </S>",
    "<S> the dashed lines for d+au collisions are just above 1 , and are virtually indistinguishable from one another in the two trigger window cases . </S>",
    "<S> the data shown are preliminary results from phenix on the ratio of the apds for 0 - 20% d+au to p+p collisions for all charged hadrons on the near side in association with a pion trigger in the @xmath10 range of 5 - 10 gev / c @xcite . despite the differences in the calculated and measured quantities </S>",
    "<S> , the general agreement between the two suggests that our model calculation has captured the essence of the nature of the correlation . </S>",
    "<S> there are also other preliminary experimental data on conditional yield in d+au collisions that show approximate independence on centrality @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the reason why there is less centrality dependence in d+au collisions is that the thermal - shower component plays a much less prominant role than it does in au+au collisions . since the parts in the factors @xmath36 in @xmath13 and @xmath23 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 2 ] ) that depend on @xmath17 cancel each other , only the @xmath37 terms in eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ 6 ] ) produce the centrality dependence , and they are minor in d+au collisions . for au+au collisions </S>",
    "<S> @xmath38 recombination is insignificant in the intermdediate @xmath10 region , so the @xmath39 terms are dominant in eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ 6 ] ) , resulting in the dependence on centrality shown in part ( b ) of figs .  1 and 2 . </S>",
    "<S> figure 3 exhibits the difference of the two colliding systems in terms of ratios .    </S>",
    "<S> we have calculated the associated particle distributions only for @xmath40 gev / c because our formalism for particle production is not reliable for @xmath41 gev / c . </S>",
    "<S> for that reason we do not integrate the associated particle distribution to determine the yield per trigger , since it is dominated by the contribution from the low @xmath10 region . nevertheless , by inspection of the distributions in figs .  1 and 2 </S>",
    "<S> , it is clear that the yield / trigger is not likely to depend on centrality very much for d+au collisions , but significantly for au+au collisions .    </S>",
    "<S> our conclusion is that when the associated particle distributions are calculated as the ratio of the integrals given in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 2 ] ) , we find significant dependence on centrality for au+au collisions @xcite , but negligible dependence on centrality for d+au collisions , and is in agreement with the data @xcite .    </S>",
