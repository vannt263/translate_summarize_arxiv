    "blue straggler stars ( bsss ) are brighter and bluer ( hotter ) than the main sequence ( ms ) turnoff ( to ) .",
    "they are located along an extension of the ms in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of globular clusters ( gcs ) and they are known to be more massive than normal ms stars ( @xcite ) , thus indicating that a process able to increase the initial mass of a single star must be at work . while bsss have been demonstrated to be invaluable probes of gc internal dynamics and their radial distribution is indeed a powerful tool to measure the cluster dynamical age @xcite , many basic questions about the formation mechanisms and the physical properties of these puzzling objects remain open . at the moment",
    ", two main leading scenarios have been proposed for their formation : bsss could be generated by mass - transfer activity in binary systems ( mt - bsss ; @xcite ) , possibly up to the complete coalescence of the two companions , or they may form by collision - induced stellar mergers ( col - bsss ; @xcite ) . + the spectroscopic analysis seems to be the most promising way to discriminate between the two formation channels .",
    "in fact , hydrodynamical simulations predict carbon ( c ) and oxygen ( o ) depletion for mt - bsss , due to the fact that the material on the bss surface comes from the deep regions of the donor star , where the cno - burning already occurred ( @xcite ) .",
    "conversely , very little mixing is expected to occur between the inner cores and the outer envelopes of the colliding stars , so that col - bsss should show normal c and o abundances @xcite .",
    "those theoretical results have been confirmed by the observation in 47 tucanae ( 47 tuc , * ? ? ? * hereafter f06 ) , of 6 ( out of 42 ) bsss showing c and o depletion .",
    "unfortunately , at the moment , 47 tuc is the only gc where such a kind of signature has been oberved .",
    "in fact , the subsequent analysis of the bss population of m4 lead to the conclusion that all of the observed bsss show normal c and o abundances ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter l10 ) , suggesting that either they are all formed through collisions or , more likely , that the depletion is a transient phenomen ( in fact , according to the percentage of co - depleted bsss found in 47 tuc , there should have been 0 - 1 bsss with c and o depletion in m4 ) .",
    "moreover , from the analysis of the bss population in ngc 6397 , @xcite ( hereafter l12 ) highlighted the occurrence of a particle transport process called radiative levitation on the atmosphere of bsss hotter than @xmath0 8000 k. such process , already known to occur in hb stars hotter than @xmath3 k @xcite , alters the surface chemical abundances ( in particular , it increases the mean metallicity ) thus preventing the interpretion of any surface abundance in terms of bss formation mechanism . +",
    "another interesting property that can be studied to infer information on the bss formation processes is the projected rotational velocity v@xmath4 @xmath5 .",
    "however , the theoretical scenario is quite complex .",
    "in fact , mt - bsss are expected to have high rotational velocities because of the angular momentum transfer @xcite .",
    "unfortunately accurate simulations are lacking , mostly because of the difficulty in following the evolution of a hydrodynamic system ( the mass transfer between binary components ) up to the system merge @xcite .",
    "this time - scale is unknown but certainly large , of the order of half a billion years @xcite .",
    "according to some authors @xcite , also col - bsss should rotate fast .",
    "nevertheless , the rotation of both mt and col - bsss might be slowed down by braking mechanisms ( @xcite ) , like magnetic braking and disk locking , for which efficiencies and time - scales are not well known yet .    from an observational point of view",
    ", a large fraction of fast rotating bsss ( @xmath0 40% ) has been identified in m4 by l10 but , at the moment , this is the only studied cluster exhibiting such a large population of fast rotating bsss .",
    "in fact , according to f06 and l10 , almost all the bsss in 47 tuc and ncg 6397 have low rotational velocities , with only one exception .",
    "moreover , no difference has been found in the rotational velocity distributions of co - depleted and normal bsss in 47 tuc , suggesting that no particular rotational velocity can be univocally linked to a given formation channel .",
    "+ however , the discovery of two distinct sequences of bsss in the gc m30 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter f09 ) has recently opened a new perspective in the study of a possible photometric signature of the bss formation process : two almost parallel sequences similarly populated ( 24 stars in the blue sequence and 21 stars in the red one ) have been revealed in this cluster .",
    "the two populations show a different level of segregation ( the red bsss being more centrally concentrated ) and possibly have different origin since the blue sequence is well fit by evolutionary models of col - bsss ( @xcite ) , while the red one well corresponds to the lower envelope of the distribution of mt binaries simulated by @xcite .",
    "f09 suggested that the core collapse event boosted the rate of direct stellar collisions , hardened binary systems and could have generated the two populations 1 - 2 gyr ago .",
    "the present study is devoted to a spectroscopic screening of bsss selected along the two sequences , with the goal of investigating their physical properties and further investigate the proposed interpretation of the two distinct populations .",

    "the most intriguing finding concerns the o abundance that in 4 out of 5 red cold bsss results to be systematically lower than the typical values observed in the rgb and hb stars of the cluster .",
    "the upper limits of [ o / fe ] for those 4 red bsss range from @xmath150.13 dex down to @xmath150.36 dex .",
    "and they are incompatible with the o abundances derived for the hb stars .",
    "unfortunately , the only cold bss along the blue sequence is # 13000594 , for which we are not able to derive significative o upper limits from the xshooter spectra .",
    "the very low o abundance in 4 red bsss is incompatible with the o depletion associated with the second generation stars in this cluster ( in fact , it is significantly lower than that measured in hb stars and also in rgb stars ; see fig .",
    "[ oxm30 ] and @xcite ) .",
    "this clearly suggests that other mechanisms able to reduce the o abundance occurred . in principle",
    ", a possibility could be that of the gravitational settling , which is due to temperature , pressure and abundance gradients , leading to the sinking of the atoms .",
    "up to the present , no theoretical models taking into account the balance between radiative levitation and gravitation settling exist in the literature for bsss , so that it is not possible to predict the variation of surface chemical abundances due to the occurrence of the two processes . on the base of a rough reasoning",
    ", it could be possible that the gravitational settling leads to a simultaneous depletion of both o and fe and that a larger effect might be observed on fe abundances because the fe atoms are heavier than those of o. in this case we would be able to discard that our results are the effect of the gravitational settling , due to the fact that the fe abundance for the o - depleted bsss are fully compatible with those of normal cluster stars .",
    "however , even if we are not able to completely discard the possibility that the observed depletion is ( at least partially ) produced by the effect of gravitational settling , at the moment the hypothesis of a mt origin is the most likely , particularly according to the interpretation of the red sequence proposed by f09 .",
    "unfortunately , the low metallicity of m30 does not allow us to measure c abundances , while the blue bsss that should not be affected by radiative levitation are too faint to be properly observed with flames .",
    "thus , the present sample does not allow us to fully investigate whether the two bss sequences of m30 harbor stars formed from the two different mechanisms , but the strong o - depletion observed in 4 red bsss is a relevant clue in support to this scenario .",

    "<S> we present spectroscopic observations acquired with flames and xshooter at the very large telescope for a sample of 15 blue straggler stars ( bsss ) in the globular cluster ( gc ) m30 . </S>",
    "<S> the targets have been selected to sample the two bss sequences discovered , with 7 bsss along the blue sequence and 8 along the red one . </S>",
    "<S> no difference in the kinematical properties of the two groups of bsss has been found . in particular , almost all the observed bsss have projected rotational velocity lower than @xmath030 @xmath1 , with only one ( blue ) fast rotating bss ( @xmath290 @xmath1 ) , identified as a w uma binary . </S>",
    "<S> this rotational velocity distribution is similar to those obtained in 47 tucanae and ngc  6397 , while m4 remains the only gc studied so far harboring a large fraction of fast rotating bsss . </S>",
    "<S> all stars hotter than @xmath07800 k ( regardless of the parent bss sequence ) show iron abundances larger than those measured from normal cluster stars , with a clearcut trend with the effective temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this behaviour suggests that particle trasport mechanisms driven by radiative levitation occur in the photosphere of these stars , as already observed for the bsss in ngc  6397 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , 4 bsss belonging to the red sequence ( not affected by radiative levitation ) show a strong depletion of [ o / fe ] , with respect to the abundance measured in red giant branch and horizontal branch stars . </S>",
    "<S> this o - depletion is compatible with the chemical signature expected in bsss formed by mass transfer processes in binary systems , in agreement with the mechanism proposed for the formation of bsss in the red sequence . </S>"
