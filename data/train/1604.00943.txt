    "ultrathin two - dimensional materials such as graphene and mos@xmath0 are appealing candidates for a new generation of opto - electronic devices@xcite such as photoresponsive memories@xcite , light - emitting and harvesting devices@xcite , or nano - scale transistors@xcite .",
    "they are also suitable platforms for carrying out research on fundamental physics phenomena like the valley hall effect,@xcite ultrafast charge transfer,@xcite or valley excitons in two - dimensional materials.@xcite technologically , single - layer mos@xmath0 is relevant due to a direct optical gap at 1.8 ev and a high electron mobility.@xcite    the optical response of mos@xmath0 is dominated by strongly bound excitons.@xcite the same holds for the other group vi semiconducting single - layer transition - metal dichalcogenides ( tmds ) such mx@xmath0 with m = mo or w and x = s , se , or te@xcite .",
    "this suggests their possible use in opto - electronic devices working at room temperature .",
    "nevertheless most of the modern first - principles ground and excited state simulations are performed at 0 k and thus omit the role of thermal lattice vibrations on the electronic and optical properties .    in general , temperature has a capital influence on the electronic and optical properties of semiconductors determining their application as optoelectronic devices.@xcite it is well known that its drives the band gap renormalization,@xcite and induces changes in the position and width of the optical peaks.@xcite at the same time also the spectra obtained from other techniques such as angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) @xcite are clearly influenced by the temperature due to the enhanced mixing of electron and phonon states .    the possibility to perform electronic structure calculations based on _ ab - initio _ approaches including the electron - phonon ( ep )",
    "interaction is thus of paramount importance . even though many years ago @xcite heine , allen and cardona ( hac ) pointed out that the ep coupling can induce corrections of the electronic levels as large as those induced by the electronic correlation , the number of works based on first - principles simulations addressing this problem is still very limited and mainly dedicated to traditional bulk compounds.@xcite the inclusion of ep couplings considerably broadens the scope of first - principles electronic - structure calculations beyond the study of temperature effects .",
    "it opens the way to the study of many interesting phenomena such as polaron formation in crystals and transport properties.@xcite    as for mos@xmath0 , theoretical _ ab - initio _ studies including the ep interaction have addressed specific aspects such as phonon - limited mobility,@xcite thermal conductivity,@xcite electron cooling,@xcite or electron transport.@xcite tongay _ _ et . al.__@xcite",
    "have performed a theoretical and experimental study of the band gap dependence on temperature for multi - layer mose@xmath0 and mos@xmath0 .",
    "they have attributed all temperature effects to lattice renormalization induced by the thermal expansion .",
    "they capture correctly the band gap trend only for high temperatures ( above 300 k ) .",

    "we explore using a fully _ ab initio _ approach how the ep interaction induces changes in the electronic structure and optical properties of the mos@xmath0 single - layer .",
    "this also enables us to address photoluminescence,@xcite arpes,@xcite and resonant raman scattering experiments.@xcite    differently from most of the recent works on bulk materials @xcite we do not limit our study to the band gap renormalization but we extend our investigation to the full band structure , with special attention to the electron states of interest for opto - electronic applications . starting from previous studies which established the existence of several kind of excitonic states in this low - dimensional material,@xcite",
    "whose behavior we characterize as a function of the temperature .",
    "we calculate the shift of the binding energy and the non - radiative linewidths of excited states .",
    "it is worth to underline that in our approach we use the full spinorial nature of the wave functions through all ground and excited state calculations .",
    "this is quite important because it is well known that spin - orbit coupling determines the valley polarization dynamics and is fundamental to understand the optical properties of all tmds .",
    "our calculations start with density - functional theory ( dft ) to obtain a first estimate of the electronic bands .",
    "we use density - functional perturbation theory ( dfpt ) to calculate the phonon modes and the electron - phonon coupling matrix elements . with the latter",
    "we calculate the change of the electronic bands due to the lattice vibrations.@xcite afterwards , we solve the temperature dependent bethe - salpeter equation@xcite .",
    "we thus explore the change in the optical spectra , and in the exciton energies and linewidths when temperature increases .",
    "the ground state properties of single - layer mos@xmath0 , eigenvalues and wave functions , are calculated with the quantum espresso code@xcite within the local density approximation ( lda ) for the exchange - correlation potential .",
    "we use dfpt to obtain the phonon modes as well as the first and second order electron - phonon matrix elements.@xcite as mentioned in the introduction the spin - orbit interaction is essential to correctly describe excitons in mos@xmath0 , for this reason also the electron - phonon matrix elements are calculated taking into account the full spinor wave functions .",
    "we study the temperature effects on the electronic states and on the excitons by merging dft / dfpt with many - body perturbation theory . within this framework ,",

    ", temperature enters via the phonon population . in polar semiconductors",
    "the electron - phonon interaction strength becomes larger when including the frhlich polar - coupling term.@xcite nonetheless , the lo - to splitting in mos@xmath0 is rather small , 3 @xmath19 , and we do not expect significant changes in single - layer .",

    "if the quasi - particle approximation ( qpa ) is valid , and assuming a smooth frequency dependence , the electron - phonon self - energy can be expanded up to the first order around the bare energies ( @xmath21 ) . in this case",

    "therefore the qpa makes sense when @xmath24 takes a value close to 1 .",
    "if the qpa holds , the spectral function , @xmath25 , the imaginary part of the green s function , is a single peak lorentzian function centred at @xmath26 and with width @xmath23 .",
    "the narrower the spectral function is the weaker the electron - lattice interaction is .",
    "when the electron - lattice interaction becomes strong enough , the qpa breaks down , the spectral functions does no longer consist of lorentzian peaks but span a wide energy range.@xcite",
    "the calculation of the electronic structure of mos@xmath0 has been done in a plane - wave basis using norm - conserving pseudopotentials and a kinetic energy cutoff of 80 ry and a @xmath27-grid of @xmath28 . on top of self - consistent dft simulations ,",

    "we have found that , the spectral functions of mos@xmath0 converge using a set of 400 randomly distributed @xmath29 points and 36 bands ( 18 occupied bands - we do not take into account mo - semicore electrons - and 18 empty bands ) .",
    "the calculations are converged with respect to number of @xmath29-points and bands .",
    "we have checked this on the profile of the spectral function which is a more stringent test than checking the eigenvalue correction .",
    "we have used a lorentzian broadening of 60 mev .",
    "recent works on diamond and silicon required a much larger number of bands and @xmath13-points to reach convergence.@xcite .",
    "the rapid convergence with the number of @xmath13-points we have found here is mainly due to the two - dimensional nature of the material under investigation .",
    "figure [ spectral - functions ] shows the spectral function of single - layer mos@xmath0 for temperature 0 k ( left panel ) and 300 k ( right panel ) .",
    "an animated represenation of the band structures for temperature ranging from 0 to 1000 k in step of 100 k can be found in the supplementary informations .",
    "dotted black lines represent the lda band structure ( without electron - phonon interaction ) .",
    "we have marked with squares some important points in the band structures , which will be discussed in more detail below .",
    "the bands are no longer a line and they acquire a broadening .",
    "this broadening is directly related to the linewidths of each quasiparticle state .",
    "considering that lifetimes are inversely proportional to linewidths , narrow lines are related to long lifetimes , i.e. , stable states . on the opposite ,",
    "broader states have a stronger interaction with phonons and they have more non - radiative recombination paths , meaning a shorter lifetime .",
    "we identify very narrow line shapes at the band edges like the valence band states at @xmath30 and @xmath31 points . in the conduction band",
    "we find narrow line shapes at @xmath30 and at the minimum between @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "temperature tends to reduce the quasi - particle energy but it does not change significantly the spectral function , it only moves the maximum to lower energies .",
    "the increase of temperature results in a shrinking of the gap . even at 0",
    "k the gap is diminished by 75 mev ( with respect to its value calculated without electron - phonon coupling ) .",
    "this is an effect of the zero - point vibrations of the atoms .",
    "the spectral functions of quasi - particle states far from the band edges have a different aspect .",
    "close to crossings , the bands become blurred , making it difficult to distinguish individual bands . for instance , the conduction band around @xmath31 and the crossing close to @xmath32 have a noticeable broadening , even at 0 k. the @xmath33 point shows also broader bands than the @xmath31 and the @xmath30 point .",
    "the increasing of temperature blurs even more the reminiscence of the lda band dispersion . in areas close to @xmath31 ,",
    "the band index becomes almost obsolete and we observe a wide spectral range.@xcite it is worth to note that quasi - particle states are not necessarily broadened peaks centered at the renormalized electron energy .",
    "they can also be mixed states which can have a structure very different from the superposition of the electron and hole density of states .",
    "we also expect important consequences on the optical properties .",

    "the electron - phonon interaction conserves the spin degeneracy .",
    "however , the valence band states are splitted due to the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "comparison with mos@xmath0 arpes data collected at 80 k is a delicate issue.@xcite experimental broadening is not exclusively related to electron - phonon decay .",

    "<S> temperature influences the performance of two - dimensional materials in optoelectronic devices . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the optical characterization of these materials is usually realized at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless most _ ab - initio _ studies are yet performed without including any temperature effect . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> important features are thus overlooked , such as the relative intensity of the excitonic peaks and their broadening , directly related to the temperature and to the non - radiative exciton relaxation time . </S>",
    "<S> we present _ ab - initio _ calculations of the optical response of single - layer mos@xmath0 , a prototype 2d material , as a function of temperature using density functional theory and many - body perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the electron - phonon interaction using the full spinorial wave functions , i.e. , fully taking into account effects of spin - orbit interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we find that bound excitons ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 peaks ) and resonant excitons ( @xmath3 peak ) exhibit different behavior with temperature , displaying different non - radiative linewidths . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the inhomogeneous broadening of the absorption spectra is mainly due to electron - phonon scattering mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations explain the shortcomings of previous ( zero - temperature ) theoretical spectra and match well with the experimental spectra acquired at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we disentangle the contributions of acoustic and optical phonon modes to the quasi - particles and exciton linewidths . </S>",
    "<S> our model also allows to identify which phonon modes couple to each exciton state , useful for the interpretation of resonant raman scattering experiments . </S>"
