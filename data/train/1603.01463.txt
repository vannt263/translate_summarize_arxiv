    "long - baseline interferometry in the optical and infrared wavelengths is living a `` golden age '' which indicates its maturity as an observing technique .",
    "i chose here not to develop the history of interferometry as it has already been extensively presented in numerous reviews ( e.g. shao & colavita @xcite , lawson @xcite , jankov @xcite , and including in this book : lna @xcite ) .",
    "i would also suggest reading the excellent book on optical interferometry from a. glindemann ( @xcite ) , where all the notions which are rapidly explained here , are detailed .",
    "i will rather try to get into more details of new ideas and now - commonly understood aspects which have been developed in the years after the publication of millour ( @xcite ) , namely the breakthrough of spectrally - dispersed interferometry and its consequences , how to cope with chromatic datasets , how to make a model of such data , and imaging techniques .",
    "i will also try to present what makes a good interferometer .",
    "the resolution power of an optical system , given its optical elements are perfect , is only related to its size ( diameter ) .",
    "this property was noted by lord rayleigh , which gave his name to the so - called empiric rayleigh criterion @xmath0 :    @xmath1    with @xmath2 the telescope diameter , and @xmath3 the wavelength of observation .",
    "this relation comes from an approximate estimate of the radius of the first zero in the airy function , which is involved in the description of the diffraction pattern of a round pupil ( see later ) .",
    "the consequence is that , even making abstraction of all practical problems affecting an instrument , there is a fundamental limit in its resolution power , directly linked to its diameter and the wave - properties of light .",
    "if one takes the simple example of our sun , which has an approximate diameter of 30  , an instrument with a pupil smaller than @xmath4 m will not be able to resolve it in the visible ( i.e. at @xmath5 nm , see defrre  @xcite ) . as an illustration of this effect",
    ", most insects , whose eyes are composed of tiny ommatidia ( @xmath6 m ) see the sun as a point source , whereas men , whose pupil is @xmath7 mm , can resolve it ( with the use of an adequate filter , of course ) . to resolve one of the biggest star in the sky , betelgeuse with a diameter of 44mas ( michelson & pease , @xcite , haubois  @xcite )",
    ", the needed telescope diameter would be @xmath8 m , i.e. slightly larger than the 100 inches ( 2.5 m ) of the hooker telescope used by michelson & pease ( @xcite ) to resolve it ( hence the installation of a boom supporting mirrors to enlarge the available aperture ) . to resolve a dwarf star similar to the sun located at 10pc ( i.e. a star with an angular diameter of 0.9 milli - arcsecond )",
    ", one would need to build a 150 m diameter telescope , which is simply unfeasible with the current techniques ( see e.g. monnet & gilmozzi , @xcite ) .    the way to go to get finer details on stars is interferometry , i.e. combining several telescopes into a `` virtual telescope '' the diameter of the utmost - separated apertures .",
    "to understand what an interferometer does , one needs to understand what a point spread function ( psf ) is .",
    "i recall here the introduction of millour ( @xcite ) .",
    "the light propagating from the astrophysical source to the observer has come a long way .",
    "let us represent it by the classical electromagnetic wave :    @xmath10    here , @xmath11 represents the electric field , @xmath12 the magnetic field , which form a plane perpendicular to the propagation direction , @xmath13 is the position in space , @xmath14 is the time and @xmath15 the light pulsation , related to the wavelength @xmath3 and the speed of light @xmath16 by @xmath17 .    the light intensity at the focus of the instrument ( see fig .  [ fig : lightpropagation ] for details ) is the result of the superposition of many electromagnetic waves coming from the pupil of the instrument :    @xmath18    the @xmath19 index represent a number of arbitrarily chosen points in the plane of interest .",
    "@xmath20 is the 2d coordinate vector onto the focal plane , screen or detector .",
    "for example , @xmath21 is the coordinate vector onto the pupil plane .",
    "@xmath22 represents the propagation delay between the different incoming electromagnetic waves .    when the pupil is split like in fig .",
    "[ fig : lightpropagation ] , it is convenient to define @xmath12 the separation vector between the sub - pupils .",
    "this vector , or its length , is often called `` baseline '' .",
    "if one considers a point - source light emitter ( i.e. the wavefront at the entrance pupil is a plane ) , this expression can be integrated onto the pupil , instead of summed as in eq .",
    "[ eq : intensity2 ] to see what the shape of the intensity in the image plane is .",
    "for example , in the case of a round pupil of diameter @xmath2 , the light intensity will follow an airy pattern ( see the demonstration in perez @xcite page 288 ) , which writes :    @xmath23 ^ 2 \\label{eq : airy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath24 and @xmath25 the 1@xmath26 order bessel function .",
    "an illustration of different pupils and the associated psf is shown in figure  [ fig : pupilpsf ] .",
    "the consequence is that a point - source does not appear as a point source through a telescope or instrument , owing to the rayleigh criterion ( the factor 1.22 comes from the first zero of the bessel function ) .",
    "an instrument is therefore limited in angular resolution by the diameter ( or maximum baseline ) of its aperture .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     a word on the `` technical '' time plotted here : the cumulative time , including technical one , exceeds the number of clear sky nights , since some technical activities do not need the telescope open .",
    "we also note here that the vlti technical time was not fully taken into account in the scheduling until 2008 , leaving the impression that the vlti was `` idle '' most of the time .",
    "a `` tough '' telescope is a stable one .",
    "`` stable '' means the telescope do not transmit vibrations to the instrument .",
    "usual instruments at the focus of telescopes are sensitive ( at first order ... ) to transverse vibrations ( i.e. `` tip / tilt '' vibrations ) .",
    "this puts some requirements on the tip / tilt pointing and stability accuracy ( see for example a study in altarac  @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , an interferometer is sensitive _ both _ to transverse and longitudinal vibrations ( a.k.a .",
    "`` opd '' or `` piston '' vibrations )",
    ". both of the large telescopes interferometers are subject to such vibrations as they were not designed in the first time to be used in an interferometer ( hess  @xcite , millour  @xcite ) . to overcome these effects ,",
    "an active dampening system had to be integrated into both facilities ( hess   @xcite , lizon  @xcite , poupar  @xcite , spaleniak  @xcite ) .    on smaller telescopes facilities ,",
    "vibrations have also been investigated but this effect has a much smaller amplitude ( merand  @xcite ) .",
    "it is worth to note that the vlt instruments are themselves affected by vibrations ( sauvage , private communication ) , and vibrations assessment are a part of the elts design .",
    "`` large '' telescopes means large collecting area , means more sensitive interferometer .",
    "however , one needs to bear in mind that the gain in sensitivity is true _ only _ for a constant strehl ratio of the telescope psf , simply because the overall effective transmission of the system , when using optical fibres , is multiplied by the strehl ratio .",
    "this is why very large telescopes interferometers ( vlti & keck ) have been equipped with adaptive optics ( arsenault  @xcite ) .",
    "the light is fed by a series of mirrors from the telescope to the delay lines building .",
    "this is where a large part of the light propagation occurs in the interferometer and where potentially several issues can happen to the beam .",
    "three possibilities exist today to transport the beam :    * through air ( e.g. in vlti and keck - i ) , * through vacuum ( e.g. in iota , chara , npoi ) , * through fibers ( developed for the ohana project , woillez  @xcite ) .",
    "the air transportation is the simplest to setup with just tunnels and relay optics to be installed ( no bulky vacuum tubes and pumps ) .",
    "however , the air introduces chromatic longitudinal dispersion when large delays are compensated , which affects the fringe signal and is not easy to overcome for high - precision measurements ( tubbs  @xcite , vannier  @xcite ) .",
    "delay lines are a set of movable mirrors which compensate for the optical delay induced by the pointing of the telescope .",
    "these are supposedly simple at first glance but one needs to consider the required precision ( less than 1 ) , and range of motion ( half the largest telescope baseline , i.e. it can be hundreds of meters ) .",
    "these optical systems are in no way simple to build and operate , as the mirrors - bearing carriage has to provide sub - micron position accuracy on hundreds of meters with a continuous motion of a few centimetres per second ...    several technical solutions have been implemented , which all have advantages and drawbacks : the delay lines can be in the air ( like on vlti or keck - i ) or in vacuum ( like on iota ) , or partially in vacuum and partially in air ( like in chara , npoi ) .",
    "they can be one stage ( vlti ) or two stages ( iota , keck - i , chara , npoi ) with a long - stroke fixed delay ( easier to manufacture ) and short - stroke moving delay .",
    "the last element of the interferometer is the combiner .",
    "it is basically a michelson or a fizeau interferometer plugged - in to a very sophisticated video camera with some degree of spectral dispersion and a feedback loop to stabilise the fringes .",
    "the fringe combination can be done in different ways and we refer the reader to berger ( @xcite , this book ) for further details .",
    "all these sub - systems are shown in the illustration fig .",
    "[ fig : schemainterf ] .",
    "the vlti is the only large - aperture interferometer in operation today . with its four 8-meter class telescopes , supplemented by four movable 2-meter class telescopes ( see fig  [ fig : schemainterf ] )",
    ", it offers versatility and sensitivity at the same time .",
    "it saw its first light in 2001 ( glindemann  @xcite ) with the vinci instrument , and has since seen its capabilities increasing : 2 recombined telescopes in 2001 ( kervella  @xcite ) , mid - infrared with midi ( leinert  ) , 3 telescopes and a high spectral resolution in 2004 with amber ( petrov  @xcite ) and 4 telescopes in 2010 with pionier ( le bouquin  @xcite , but lacking a high or medium spectral resolution , and just open to the general community since 2015 ) .",
    "the vlti is noticeably the most productive interferometric facility in the world ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : pubinterf ] ) . applying for observing time is open to any professional astronomer , and its archive is public after typically one year of ownership by the pi . the next generation instruments matisse and gravity will offer to the wide community four telescopes and , for the first time , real imaging capabilities .",
    "chara is a six-1-meter - class telescopes interferometer , which is funded and operated by the georgia state university .",
    "it has developed in the 2000s a collaborative framework allowing teams from all over the world to install and operate instruments on the facility . as a result , chara is the interferometer with the most number of currently - operated instruments , with classic , climb , mirc , pavo , vega .",
    "chara has the longest operating baselines ( 300 m ) and works in the visible range , making it the sharpest telescope on earth .",
    "npoi is a six - telescope interferometer jointly operated by the lowell observatory and the us navy .",
    "it consists of small apertures movables siderostats for imaging as well as fixed siderostats dedicated to astrometry .",
    "its recent developments include a 6-telescope visible instrument vision and the commissioning of new longer baselines .",
    "it is currently limited by the small apertures , but the developement plan includes the installation of meter - class telescopes in the future .",
    "the long - term durability of the data acquired by the interferometers make it a goldmine for future astronomers .",
    "therefore some observatories have made an effort to archive the obtained data and to make it public for future use .",
    "this is e.g. the case for the eso science archive facility which provides raw datasets from all the open vlti instruments plus , more recently , data from the visitor instrument pionier .",
    "since eso provides only raw datasets , a community effort is being made , led by jmmc , to provide a reduced database called oidb .",
    "it will provide in a near - future reduced datasets which have been published , in order to make them accessible for future use .",
    "an effort has also been conducted to make the legacy keck - i and pti instruments data avilable through the pti & keck public database .",
    "future users can access freely these data and use them in a publication provided they follow the publishing guidelines available at eso and nexsci webpages .",
    "the vlti has been at the leading edge for optical interferometry in the last decade .",
    "however , the two first - generation instruments , amber and midi are now 10 years old , and even though they have unmatched features ( high spectral resolution for amber and n band for midi ) , they start to show their limits .",
    "therefore , eso issued a call for proposals in 2005 to build second generation instruments .",
    "two projects were selected : gravity , aiming at performing micro - arcseconds astrometry on the galactic center in the near - infrared , and matisse , aiming at opening the l band in addition to bring imaging capabilities to the vlti in the mid - infrared .",
    "they both come to the sky in the 5 + years from now .",
    "the chara array is being fitted with adaptive optics to improve by a large factor its performances , especially at short wavelengths , offering new possibilities of performant instrumentation in the 5 + years to come .    in the meantime ,",
    "several projects have emerged to pave the way of future facilities : a visible interferometry prospective is being conducted today ( stee et al . in prep . ) , to make emerge a new generation instrumentation at vlti and chara in the 10 + years ; a more general prospective is conducted by the europan interferometry initiative to direct future instruments in the same timeline ( pott , private communication ) ; the planet formation imager project ( kraus  @xcite ) aims at imaging and characterizing an exoplanet in the 20 + coming years ; finally several bold prototypes of completely new combination schemes ( le coroller  @xcite , labeyrie  @xcite , and see also the conclusion of this book : labeyrie @xcite ) , _ hypertelescopes _ , are being imagined , developed and tested to gather the technologies necessary for the 40 + years to come .",
