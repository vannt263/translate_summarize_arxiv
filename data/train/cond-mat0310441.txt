    "an enormous interest in the family of the doped manganice oxides t@xmath0d@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( in which t is trivalent rare earth and d is divalent alkaline ) in perovskite structure have been recent renewed.@xciteas doping @xmath3 and temperature t varied , the manganites show a very rich phase diagram involving phases with spin , charge and orbital order.@xcitein the cubic lattice , the five - fold degenerate @xmath4-orbitals of an isolated atom or ion are spilitted into a manifold of three lower energy ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 ) , usually referred to as @xmath8 one mixing with the surrounding oxygens is included , and two higher energy states ( d@xmath9 and d@xmath10 ) called @xmath11 state .",
    "electron @xmath8 are usually located but electron @xmath11 are itinerant so they create band energy . the correlation between @xmath8 and @xmath11 electron is expressed by double exchange ( de ) mechanism@xcite inwhich two motions involving electrons moving from the oxygen atom to the mn@xmath12 ions and other one from the mn@xmath13 to the oxygen atom .",
    "the main feature of de is cooperative effect where the motion of an itinerant electron favors the ferromagnetic ( fm ) ordering of local spin and , vice versa , the presence of the fm order facilitates the motions of the itinerant electron .",
    "the de model has been studied in `` one orbital '' model because it is not only simplify but also contains enough degree of freedom to manifest the phenomena of de mechanism which was envisioned in the early days of manganites studies .",
    "+ recent experiment observed in the manganites have shown that the de model alone can not explain the quantitative features of the temperature dependence of the resistivity through the entire temperature range@xcite . to improve the theoretical understanding in manganites ,",
    "there are two proposed resolutions of this problem .",
    "the first one is a large jahn - teller lattice distortion which causes a metal - insulator transition ( mit ) via strong polaronic narrowing of the conduction electron band .",
    "however , the jahn - teller lattice distortion makes the charge - ordering phase occurs before the fm transition temperature@xcitewhich is not suitable with experimental observation at half - filling.@xcitein the second proposed resolution , the insulating behavior is caused by a combination of both magnetic disorder and non - magnetic ionic disorder .",
    "the magnetic disorder arises from the random de factor cos(@xmath14 ) in the electronic hoping ( @xmath15 is the angle between local spins ) which call off - diagonal .",
    "the non - magnetic comes from the ionic doping of the d@xmath16 ion ( i.e. from randomness at the chemical substituting t@xmath13 by d@xmath16 ) which leads to a random local potential for the charge carriers .",
    "this disorder always presents in doped manganite which called diagonal - disorder that can lead to anderson localization of the charge carriers.@xciteit is well known that , the diagonal - disorder can be modeled by the falicov - kimball ( fk ) model.@xcite although the fk model is simple , it contains a rich variety of phases which are controlled by electron interaction.@xciteincorporating the diagonal - disorder of fk type into de model , one may expect that a disorder - order phase transition could present .",
    "when phase transition occurs , a co - fm phase may be stabilized at low temperature@xcite and the behaviors of transport coefficients can be more close with the experiment results . in this paper , the transport coefficients such as d.c .",
    "conductivity , thermal conductivity and thermal power of system are being studied by the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft)@xcite . the dmft have been extensively used for investigating strongly correlated electron system.@xciteit is based on the fact that , the self - energy depends only on frequency in the infinite dimension limit . using dmft we found that the system stabilizes inhomogeneous ferromagnetic state at low temperature and gives us a fulfill picture of behaviors of the transport coefficients . +",
    "this paper is organized as follows : +",
    "the system which we consider is described by the following hamiltonian    @xmath17    where @xmath18(@xmath19 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator for an itinerant electron with spin @xmath20 at lattice site @xmath21 . the first term in the hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) represents the hoping between the nearest neighbors sites .",
    "@xmath22 is the hoping integral and is scaled with the spatial dimension @xmath23 in the limit @xmath24 as @xcite .",
    "@xmath25 . in the following",
    "we will take @xmath26 as the unit of energy.@xcite @xmath27 is the @xmath28 component of the local spin at lattice site @xmath21 , it takes values @xmath29 , @xmath30 with @xmath31 is the @xmath28- component of pauli matrix is the spin of itinerant electron .",
    "@xmath32 is a classical variable that assumes the value @xmath33(@xmath34 ) if site @xmath21 is occupied by ( is not occupied by ) d@xmath16 ion .",
    "@xmath35 is the disorder strength and is mapped onto the difference in the local potential which spilits energetical favor of mn@xmath13 and mn@xmath12 ion , the expectation value @xmath36 ( n is the number od lattice sites ) corresponds to the concentration of unfavorable mn@xmath12 sites .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath37 controls the carrier dopings , while @xmath38 controls the fraction of the sites having the additional local potential .",
    "the condition @xmath39 where @xmath40 is electron doping is used which determines @xmath41 for each doping @xmath42 .",
    "the first three terms in the hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) describe a simplified de model which contains only the ising - type interaction between the itinerant and local electrons . within the dmft",
    "the ising type of the hund interaction gives basically same results as the ones of the hund interaction of clasical spins.@xcitethe simplication does not allow any spin - flip processes , which can be important at low temperature where spin - wave excitations may govern the thermodynamics of the system .",
    "however , within the de model the dmft calculations for quantum spins does not show significant differences from the one for clasical spins.@xcitethe last two terms in the hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) describe a binary randomness of the t - site substitution .",
    "they together with the hoping term of itinerant electrons form the fk model.@xcite + transport coefficients are calculated within a kubo - greenwood formalism@xcite , in which the dc - conductivity @xmath43 , thermal power @xmath44 and the thermal conductivity @xmath45 can be expressed with the relevant correlation functions of the current operators .",

    "the resistivity declines with decreasing temperature due to the reduction of the magnetic contribution to electron scattering .",
    "hence , at low temperature system is in fm phase .",
    "but when temperature decreases below co transition temperature , the system changes the phase to insulator ( @xmath116 ) in the large @xmath35 case . in the case of small @xmath35",
    "our system is in metallic through the entire temperature range which is the same results as in the sde model@xcite .",

    "one can see that , for weak coupling the dos is essentially unchanged from the sde model , but as @xmath35 is increased further , the gap of dos appears and its width increases .",
    "this result is precisely the kind of metal - insulator transition that mott envisioned .",
    "+ the similar results for various itinerant concentration @xmath125 also are plotted in the fig.3 .",

    "are presented .",
    "that means the disorder substantially decrease @xmath115 of the fm transition . at the same time , with increasing u , critical temperature of the co phase transition first increases , reaches its maximal value and decreases later .",
    "this behavior of critical temperature of the co phase transition is similar to the one in fk model@xcite .",
    "+ in the large strength of @xmath35 the @xmath117 and @xmath115 are close in on the same value but @xmath117 still is smaller than @xmath115 .",

    "it is found that the fm and co states are stabilized at low temperature and expected behavior of the transport coefficients are expressed respectively .",
    "those results improve the one for sde model so they describe more suitable of the transport properties in the manganites .",
