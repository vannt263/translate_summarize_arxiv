    "the discovery of deep inelastic collisions in the 1970s , in which a large amount of kinetic energy and angular momentum is dissipated from the relative motion to intrinsic excitations of colliding nuclei , brought us the concept of friction in nuclear physics  @xcite .",
    "after this discovery , gross and kalinowski developed the surface friction model ( sfm )  @xcite that takes into account this dissipative effect by introducing friction forces in a newtonian equation .",
    "more generally , dissipative aspects in self - bound system such as nuclei have important role on many physical phenomena such as fission , fusion reactions and giant resonances .    in most actual models that include dissipation and that are used to describe nuclear reactions at energies around the coulomb barrier ,",
    "dissipation mechanism is assumed to be a one - body type , where energy dissipation is caused by collision of nucleons with mean - field wall and by nucleon exchange between the two partners of the reaction .",
    "these effects are known as the wall - and - window formula  @xcite and are essentially based on classical consideration .",
    "the order of magnitude of parameters related to dissipation are generally adjusted to reproduce experiments . however , large uncertainty on those parameters exists  @xcite . therefore",
    ", description of energy dissipation from quantum microscopic models is highly desirable .",
    "it is know that time - dependent hartree - fock ( tdhf ) model  @xcite includes one - body dissipation mechanism from microscopic point of view , because of the treatment of self - consistent mean - field .",
    "it is worth mentioning that so - called fusion window problem due to underestimation of energy dissipation in old tdhf calculations has been solved by including spin - orbit interactions and time - odd terms in the energy density functional  @xcite as well as by breaking symmetries .",
    "now three - dimensional tdhf calculations including full skyrme effective interaction , that are used in recent static hartree - fock calculations , are expected to provide a better description of dissipative aspects  @xcite . up to now , there are only a few studies dedicated to extracting friction coefficient associated with one - body energy dissipation from microscopic mean - field approach  @xcite .",

    "@xcite , a method of extracting nucleus - nucleus potential and friction coefficient from tdhf has been proposed .",
