    "in a transformation method the numerical solution of a given boundary value problem is obtained by solving one or more related initial value problems ( ivps ) . in this context",
    "the classical example is the blasius problem of boundary layer theory . in the blasius problem",
    "the governing differential equation and the two initial conditions are invariant under the scaling group of transformations @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the group parameter and @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , the non - homogeneous asymptotic boundary condition is not invariant with respect to ( [ eq : scalinga ] ) .",
    "this kind of invariance was used by tpfer @xcite to define a non - iterative transformation method ( itm ) for the blasius problem by transforming the boundary conditions to initial conditions and rescaling the obtained numerical solution .",
    "this paper is concerned with the application an itm to the sakiadis problem .",
    "the main aim here is that any method developed for the blasius , or the sakiadis , problem might be extended to more challenging or interesting problems . in this context , the iterative transformation method has been recently applied to compute the normal and reverse flow solutions of stewartson @xcite for the falkner - skan model @xcite .",
    "the sakiadis problem is a variant of blasius problem that can not be solved by a non - itm .",
    "in fact , one of the initial conditions is not invariant and the asymptotic boundary condition , being homogeneous , is invariant with respect to the scaling transformations ( [ eq : scalinga ] ) .",
    "therefore , as noted by na @xcite , it is not possible to rescale an initial value solution to the given asymptotic boundary condition .",
    "moreover , the non - itm can not be applied when the governing differential equation is not invariant with respect to a scaling group of point transformations . to overcome this drawback",
    "the itm was defined in @xcite for the numerical solution of the falkner - skan model and of other problems in boundary layer theory .    here",
    "we show how the itm can be applied to problems with a homogeneous boundary conditions at infinity .",
    "moreover , we show how to couple our method with the newton s root - finder .",
    "this itm has been applied to several problems of interest : free boundary problems @xcite , a moving boundary hyperbolic problem @xcite , the falkner - skan equation in @xcite , one - dimensional parabolic moving boundary problems @xcite , two variants of the blasius problem @xcite , namely : a boundary layer problem over moving plates , studied first by klemp and acrivos @xcite , and a boundary layer problem with slip boundary condition , that has found application to the study of gas and liquid flows at the micro - scale regime @xcite , a parabolic problem on unbounded domain @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as shown in @xcite , the itm provides a simple numerical test for the existence and uniqueness of solutions .",
    "within boundary - layer theory , the model describing the steady plane flow of a fluid past a thin plate , is given by @xmath3 & \\\\[-1.2ex ] & u { \\displaystyle \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x } } + v { \\displaystyle \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y } } = \\nu { \\displaystyle \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2 } } \\ ,   \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the governing differential equations , namely conservation of mass and momentum , are the steady - state 2d navier - stokes equations under the boundary layer approximations : @xmath4 and the flow has a very thin layer attached to the plate , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the velocity components of the fluid in the @xmath7 and @xmath8 direction , and @xmath9 is the viscosity of the fluid .",
    "the boundary conditions for the velocity field are @xmath10 & \\\\[-1.2ex ] & u(x , y ) \\rightarrow u_{\\infty } \\quad \\mbox{as } \\quad y \\rightarrow \\infty \\ , \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the blasius flat plate flow problem @xcite , where @xmath11 is the main - stream velocity , and @xmath12 & \\\\[-1.2ex ] & u(x , y ) \\rightarrow 0 \\quad \\mbox{as } \\quad y \\rightarrow \\infty \\ , \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the classical sakiadis flat plate flow problem @xcite , where @xmath13 is the plate velocity , respectively .",
    "the boundary conditions at @xmath14 are based on the assumption that neither slip nor mass transfer are permitted at the plate whereas the remaining boundary condition means that the velocity @xmath6 tends to the main - stream velocity @xmath11 asymptotically or gives the prescribed velocity of the plate @xmath15 .    introducing a similarity variable @xmath16 and a dimensionless stream function @xmath17 as @xmath18 we have @xmath19 and the equation of continuity , the first equation in ( [ pde - model ] ) , is satisfied identically .    on the other hand",
    ", we get @xmath20 let us notice that , in the above equations @xmath21 represents blasius flow , whereas @xmath22 indicates sakiadis flow , respectively .    by inserting these expressions into the momentum equation , the second equation in ( [ pde - model ] ) , we get @xmath23 to be considered along with the transformed boundary conditions @xmath24 for the blasius flow , and @xmath25 for the sakiadis flow , respectively .    blasius main interest was to compute the value of the velocity gradient at the plate ( the wall shear or skin friction coefficient ) : @xmath26 to compute this value , blasius used a formal series solution around @xmath27 and an asymptotic expansions for large values of @xmath16 , adjusting the constant @xmath28 so as to connect both expansions in a middle region . in this way , blasius obtained the ( erroneous ) bounds @xmath29 .",
    "a few years later , tpfer @xcite revised the work by blasius and solved numerically the blasius problem , using a non - itm .",
    "he then arrived , without detailing his computations , at the value @xmath30 , contradicting the bounds reported by blasius .",
    "indeed , tpfer solved the ivp for the blasius equation once . at large but finite @xmath31 , ordered so that @xmath32 , he computed the corresponding scaling parameter @xmath33 . if two subsequent values of @xmath33 agree within a specified accuracy , then @xmath34 is approximately equal to the common value of the @xmath33 , otherwise , he marched to a larger value of @xmath35 and tried again . using the classical fourth order runge - kutta method , as given by butcher @xcite , and a grid step @xmath36 tpfer was able , only by hand computations , to determine @xmath34 with an error less than @xmath37 . to this end",
    "he used the two _ truncated boundaries _ @xmath38 and @xmath39 . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we follow tpfer and apply some preliminary computational tests to find a suitable value for the truncated boundary .",
    "sakiadis studied the behaviour of boundary layer flow , due to a moving flat plate immersed in an otherwise quiescent fluid , @xcite .",
    "he found that the wall shear is about 34% higher for the sakiadis flow compared to the blasius case .",
    "later , tsou and goldstein @xcite made an experimental and theoretical treatment of sakiadis problem to prove that such a flow is physically realizable .",
    "within this section we explain how it is possible to extend tpfer algorithm to the sakiadis problem , that we rewrite here for the reader convenience @xmath40 & \\\\[-1.5ex ] & f(0 ) = 0 \\ , \\qquad { \\displaystyle \\frac{df}{d\\eta}}(0 ) = 1 \\ , \\qquad { \\displaystyle \\frac{df}{d\\eta}}(\\eta ) \\rightarrow 0 \\quad \\mbox{as } \\quad \\eta \\rightarrow \\infty \\ .",
    "\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in order to define the itm we introduce the extended problem @xmath41 & \\\\[-1.5ex ] & f(0 ) = 0 \\ , \\qquad { \\displaystyle \\frac{df}{d\\eta}}(0 ) = h^{1/2 } \\ , \\qquad { \\displaystyle \\frac{df}{d\\eta}}(\\eta ) \\rightarrow 1 - h^{1/2 } \\quad \\mbox{as } \\quad \\eta \\rightarrow \\infty \\ . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in ( [ eq : sakiadis : mod ] ) , the governing differential equation and the two initial conditions are invariant , the asymptotic boundary condition is not invariant , with respect to the extended scaling group @xmath42 moreover , it is worth noticing that the extended problem ( [ eq : sakiadis : mod ] ) reduces to the sakiadis problem ( [ eq : sakiadis ] ) for @xmath43 .",
    "this means that in order to find a solution of the sakiadis problem we have to find a zero of the so - called _ transformation function _",
    "@xmath44 where the group parameter @xmath34 is defined with the formula @xmath45^{1/2 } \\ , \\ ] ] and to this end we can use a root - finder method .",
    "let us notice that @xmath28 and the transformation function are defined implicitly by the solution of the ivp @xmath46 & \\\\[-1.5ex ] & f^*(0 ) = 0 \\ , \\quad { \\displaystyle \\frac{df^*}{d\\eta^*}}(0 ) = { h^*}^{1/2 } , \\quad { \\displaystyle \\frac{d^2f^*}{d\\eta^{*2}}}(0 ) = \\pm 1   \\nonumber \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in particular , we are interested to compute @xmath47 , an approximation of the asymptotic value @xmath48 , which is used in the definition of @xmath28 ( [ eq : lambda ] ) .    for the itm we have to follow the steps :    1 .",
    "we apply a root - finder method to define a sequence @xmath49 for @xmath50 two sequences @xmath51 and @xmath52 for @xmath53 are defined by equation ( [ eq : lambda ] ) and ( [ eq : aa2.9 ] ) , respectively .",
    "a suitable convergence criterion should be used to verify whether @xmath54 as @xmath55 .",
    "if this is the case , then @xmath51 converges to the correct value of @xmath28 in the same limit .",
    "a solution of the original problem can be obtained by rescaling to @xmath56 . in particular , we have that @xmath57 where this @xmath28 is the limit value mentioned in the previous step .    several questions are of interest .",
    "as far as the missing initial condition is concerned , are we allowed to use the value @xmath58 suggested to tpfer , see for instance na @xcite , by a formal series solution of the blasius problem ? indeed ,",
    "if the first derivative of @xmath59 is a monotone decreasing function , then the given boundary conditions in ( [ eq : sakiadis ] ) indicate that the second derivative of @xmath17 has to be negative and should go to zero as @xmath16 goes to infinity and this calls for a negative value of the missing initial condition .",
    "is the solution of the sakiadis problem ( [ eq : sakiadis ] ) unique ? by studying the behaviour of the transformation function @xmath60 we can answer both questions , and this is done in the next section .",
    "it is evident that our numerical method is based on the behaviour of the transformation function .",
    "our interest is to study the behaviour of this function with respect to its independent variable as well as the involved parameters .",
    "we notice that , because of the two terms @xmath61 , which have been introduced in the modified boundary conditions in ( [ eq : sakiadis : mod ] ) , we are allowed to consider only positive values of @xmath62 .    from our numerical study concerning the dependence of @xmath60 with respect to the missing initial condition @xmath63 we have used the results plotted on figures [ fig : gamma1]-[fig : gamma2 ] .",
    "each o - symbol represent a numerical solution of the ivp ( [ eq : sakiadis : ivp ] ) with the corresponding value of @xmath62 . the solid line joining these symbols",
    "is used to show the behaviour of the transformation function . by considering the results reported on figure [ fig : gamma1 ] we realize that the missing initial condition can not be positive .",
    "it is evident from figure [ fig : gamma2 ] that the transformation function has only one zero and , by a theorem proved in @xcite , this means that the considered problem has one and only one solution .",
    "moreover , we remark that the tangent to the @xmath60 function at its unique zero and the @xmath62 axis define a large angle . from a numerical viewpoint",
    ", this means that the quest for the @xmath62 corresponding to @xmath43 is a well conditioned problem .",
    "as far as the numerical results reported in this section are concerned , the itm was applied by setting the truncated boundary @xmath69 . moreover , these results were obtained by an adaptive fourth - order runge - kutta ivp solver .",
    "the adaptive solver uses a relative and an absolute error tolerance , for each component of the numerical solution , both equal to @xmath70 .",
    "here and in the following the notation @xmath71 means a double precision arithmetic .",
    "the implementation of the secant method is straightforward .",
    "the only difficulty we have to face is related to the choice of the initial iterates . in this context the study of the transformation function of figure [ fig : gamma2 ] can be helpful . in table",
    "[ tab : itera ] we list the iterations of our itm .            for the sakiadis flow , which is obtained in the study of a moving flat plate ,",
    "the modulus of the wall shear @xmath74 is larger in comparison to the blasius flow , for a static flat plate , where we have found @xmath75 , see @xcite .",
    "the increase of the wall shear can be easily computed by latexmath:[\\[33.64\\% = \\frac{|0.332057 - 0.443761| } {                                                m.  j. martin and i.  d. boyd . .",
