    "there has recently been some interest in the nature of solutions containing a large number of bps monopoles .",
    "although we have a good understanding of the field configurations when the number of magnetic monopoles is relatively small , the situation becomes more complicated when the number increases .",
    "if the monopoles remain well separated , the solution is , with an appropriate gauge choice , given approximately by a superposition of individual bps monopoles .",
    "however , as the number of monopoles increases , their non - abelian cores increase in size until they begin to overlap and the individual monopoles merge together .",
    "bolognesi  @xcite has proposed that when @xmath4 bps magnetic monopoles are as closely packed as possible in a single region , the field configuration can be characterized as a bag , of arbitrary shape , inside of which the higgs field vanishes .",
    "following this work , ward  @xcite explored numerically a `` monopole wall '' on which bps monopoles were arranged periodically on a plane .",
    "the scalar field is approximately constant on one side of the wall , but grows linearly with the distance from the wall on the other side .",
    "this planar wall configuration can be regarded as an approximation to the field configuration near the wall of a monopole bag .",
    "however , much remains to be explored about the structure of these solutions .",
    "as long as @xmath0 remains finite ( as it must for a finite size monopole bag ) , the higgs field , although exponentially small in the bag interior , only vanishes exactly at a finite number of points . similarly , the charged vector fields are only precisely zero along special lines with nontrivial vorticity . by focusing on the patterns of these zeros , and using previous work  @xcite on solutions with platonic symmetries as a guide , we will obtain a more detailed picture of the monopole bag and its wall .",
    "as we will see , the characteristics of the solutions can change quite dramatically depending on the location of the zeros of the higgs field .",
    "one limiting case occurs when most of the zeros are located on the surface of the bag , the configuration one naturally obtains by bringing many monopoles together from spatial infinity .",
    "up to exponentially small corrections , the fields are purely abelian both inside and outside the bag , with the non - abelian behavior confined to the wall region ; we will call these abelian bags . for a spherical bag",
    ", a simple calculation shows that the minimum bag radius is of order @xmath5 , where @xmath2 is the expectation value of the higgs field . at this radius ,",
    "the non - abelian cores of the monopoles overlap , and the higgs field is approximately zero inside the bag .",
    "this gives bolognesi s bag .",
    "however one can also consider the case where the monopoles are arranged on a surface with larger radius .",
    "for the spherical case , it is easy to see that the scalar field is approximately constant , but nonvanishing , inside the bag .",
    "a simple generalization of the magnetic conductor picture of bolognesi allows one to see how to deform this configuration while keeping the higgs field constant in the interior .",
    "going in the opposite direction , one can move the higgs zeros further in toward the center .",
    "this does not reduce the size of the bag , but instead changes its character . in the limiting case , where the zeros all coincide at a point",
    ", the higgs field remains close to zero inside the bag , but the gauge field configuration becomes truly non - abelian . in a sense , the bag can be thought of as an extended monopole core .",
    "we call this a non - abelian bag",
    ".    a remarkable feature of these bags is that the bag wall has a lattice structure that gives the solution a polyhedral shape .",
    "for the abelian bag , the vertices of the lattice are defined , in an obvious manner , by the positions of the higgs zeros .",
    "this clearly can not happen for the non - abelian bag , since the zeros are all at the center .",
    "we will see that a regular structure emerges nevertheless , and will argue that it is an approximately hexagonal lattice .    in the next section we will review the essential features of the theory and establish our conventions . then , in sec",

    "we are interested in bps solutions , which obey the bogomolny equation @xmath11    we will find it convenient for the most part to work in an abelian gauge where the higgs field has a fixed gauge orientation , @xmath12 the gauge field of the unbroken electromagnetic u(1 ) is then @xmath13 while the charged massive vector meson field is @xmath14 the components of the field strength are @xmath15 where @xmath16 , and the electromagnetic covariant derivative @xmath17 .",

    "consider the case of @xmath4 monopoles distributed relatively evenly on a spherical shell of radius @xmath37 . the typical separation between neighboring monopoles is @xmath38 , which we initially assume to be much larger than the monopole core radius . outside the monopole cores ,",
    "the only nontrivial fields are the abelian electromagnetic field and the massless scalar field with magnitude @xmath39 . as long as we stay sufficiently far from the monopole cores and the sphere on which they lie , and provided that we take a sufficiently `` coarse - grained '' view of the system",
    ", we can treat this as a spherically symmetric purely abelian configuration .",
    "thus , the magnetic field will be @xmath40 where we expect @xmath41 , which measures the effective thickness of the spherical shell containing the monopole cores , to be @xmath42 . outside",
    "the monopole cores the scalar field obeys @xmath43 , with @xmath44 .",
    "hence , @xmath45    we see that there is a critical radius , @xmath1 , for which @xmath46 vanishes in the interior of the sphere .. the monopole core radius is set by the local value of @xmath46 , and so only becomes comparable to @xmath47 when @xmath48 is of order @xmath49 .",
    "] once the sphere has shrunk to @xmath3 , the monopole cores merge together to give a thin spherical wall , within which the fields are fully non - abelian , that separates an essentially empty interior from a purely abelian exterior .",
    "this is the abelian monopole bag .",
    "because @xmath46 can not become negative , the bag can not be shrunk beyond this point .",
    "the bag can be deformed from a spherical shape , but if it remains spherical its radius can not be less than @xmath3 .    for this case of a bag with critical radius , our estimate of the wall thickness needs to be modified .",
    "this thickness is determined locally by the properties of the higgs field near the wall , where @xmath46 is far from its vacuum value . the only dimensional scale relevant near the wall is the separation between monopoles on the wall , @xmath50 ,",
    "so we expect the wall thickness to be of comparable size ; i.e. , @xmath51 .",
    "although the bag radius can not be less than @xmath3 , this does not mean that the higgs zeros can not be brought closer together .",
    "in fact , one can envision bringing them all to the center , giving an @xmath0-fold zero and implying that @xmath52 near the origin . for large @xmath0",
    ", this means that we have a region with very small , although not quite vanishing , higgs field .",
    "this region thus resembles an enlarged monopole core , with both the massless gauge field and the ( just barely ) massive gauge field being nontrivial .",
    "how large is this region ? in the exterior , at large @xmath53 , the analysis above tells us that @xmath54 . this behavior can not continue for @xmath55 , so we again expect to find a spherical shell of radius @xmath56 and thickness @xmath51 separating an exterior abelian region from an interior region of almost vanishing higgs field",
    "however , in contrast with our previous case , this interior region is not empty , but instead contains an intrinsically non - abelian configuration of fields .",
    "this is the non - abelian bag .    in both cases ,",
    "the fields in the exterior region can be expanded in terms of spherical harmonics appropriate to magnetic charge @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , the massive vector field can be expanded in terms of monopole vector harmonics  @xcite .",
    "this field falls exponentially for @xmath57 , with the dominant part of the exponential tail coming from the harmonics with the lowest total angular momentum , @xmath58 .",
    "one can show  @xcite that any linear combination of such harmonics vanishes at precisely @xmath59 points on the unit sphere .",
    "these correspond to directions in which the multimonopole core region falls off faster , thus somewhat `` flattening '' the shape of the wall separating the exterior and interior regions and deforming it from a sphere to a polyhedron with @xmath60 faces .",
    "in fact , topological considerations imply the existence of other zeros of the fields .",
    "first , recall that the relation between the magnetic charge and the winding number of the higgs field implies that in an @xmath0 monopole solution the number of zeros ( with positive winding ) minus the number of antizeros ( with negative winding ) of the higgs field must be precisely @xmath0 .",
    "when the individual monopoles are widely separated , it is clear that there are @xmath0 zeros and no antizeros .",
    "however , this is not necessarily so ; we will see that there are solutions with @xmath0 units of magnetic charge that have @xmath61 higgs zeros , with the excess compensated by an antizero at the origin .",
    "in addition , the various components of @xmath21 are also required to have zeros and , in fact , lines of zeros .",
    "if the magnetic flux through a surface @xmath62 is @xmath63 , then any scalar field with unit electric charge must have @xmath64 zeros on @xmath62 , with zeros being counted with a positive ( negative ) sign if the phase of the field increases ( decreases ) by @xmath65 in going around the zero in a clockwise direction , as seen by the outward normal .",
    "the same is true of the component of @xmath21 normal to the surface .",
    "the result is modified for the tangential components .",
    "in particular , on a sphere centered about the origin @xmath66 have a total of @xmath67 zeros ; the additional factor in these cases can be understood by noting the extra terms in eq .",
    "( [ radialcurl ] ) for the covariant curl . by considering concentric spheres of arbitrary radius",
    ", we see that these zeros ( and possibly antizeros ) must form lines that can only terminate on the points where the magnetic charges are located ; i.e. , at the zeros of the higgs field . note that this is consistent with our previous remarks about the zeros of the vector harmonics with lowest angular momentum , because these only contribute to @xmath33 .",
    "a connection between magnetic charge and polyhedral shape was first encountered in a curious set of solutions that have the symmetries of the platonic solids , but not the charges that one might naively expect to be associated with these solids .",
    "although in each case the energy profile shows a concentration of energy at the vertices of a regular polyhedron , the number of vertices is never equal to the magnetic charge .",
    "thus , there is a charge - three tetrahedron  @xcite , a charge - four cube  @xcite , a charge - five octahedron  @xcite , a charge - seven dodecahedron  @xcite , and finally an icosahedron with @xmath68  @xcite ; for each of these the number of faces is equal to @xmath59 .",
    "the locations of the zeros of the higgs field are rather curious  @xcite .",
    "for the tetrahedron , octahedron , and , it is believed , the icosahedron , ( i.e. , the solids with triangular faces ) there are zeros at each of the @xmath61 vertices , and an antizero at the center .",
    "it is to be stressed that these should not be viewed as simply arrangements of @xmath61 monopoles about a central antimonopole .",
    "such an assembly would be expected to have roughly @xmath69 times the mass @xmath70 of a single monopole , whereas these solutions saturate the bps bound and so have mass @xmath71 .",
    "it should also be noted that plots  @xcite of the higgs field of the tetrahedron and octahedron show that @xmath46 remains small throughout the interior of the polyhedron . for later use ,",
    "we record their numbers of vertices @xmath72 , edges @xmath73 , and faces @xmath74 : @xmath75    the energy profiles of the other two solutions , the cube and the dodecahedron , also show concentrations about the vertices of the polyhedron .",
    "however , neither has higgs zeros at these vertices .",
    "instead , they have multiple zeros  four - fold and seven - fold , respectively  at their centers . again",
    ", plots of the higgs field for the cube  @xcite and the dodecahedron  @xcite show that it remains quite small throughout the interior region .",
    "for these solutions , corresponding to the duals of the previous examples , ) and ( [ dualnumbers ] ) agree when @xmath76 . ]",
    "as outlined in sec .  [ shellsection ] , we expect to be able to obtain an abelian monopole bag with charge @xmath78 by arranging unit monopoles on a spherical surface of critical radius .",
    "although we can not have a solution that is precisely spherically symmetric , we can hope to obtain approximate spherical symmetry by arranging the monopoles in as regular a fashion as possible .",
    "we expect to have concentrations of energy at the locations of the monopoles , so that the solutions resemble polyhedra with their vertices at the zeros of the higgs field . if we allow for the possibility of a small number of antizeros or zeros located elsewhere , this gives us @xmath79 vertices .",
    "the arguments given previously suggest that the number of faces should be @xmath59 .",
    "euler s theorem then tells us that the number of edges is @xmath80 .",
    "the smallest possible value of @xmath81 is unity , in which case all of the faces are triangular and there is a single higgs antizero , presumably at the center .",
    "this reproduces the result of eq .",
    "( [ triangnumbers ] ) , and suggests that the corresponding three platonic solutions can be seen as the prototypes of the abelian bag solutions .",
    "let us now examine these solutions more closely , focusing on the zeros of the components of the @xmath21 field .",
    "we begin by recalling that on a sphere enclosing @xmath82 units of magnetic charge the components @xmath83 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 of the massive gauge field must have @xmath64 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 zeros , respectively .",
    "this can be phrased more compactly by defining the helicity @xmath86 to be 0 , 1 , and @xmath87 for @xmath83 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , respectively ; the number of zeros for a given component of @xmath21 is then @xmath88 . by considering a series of concentric spheres , we see that these merge into lines of zeros that can only end at zeros or antizeros of the higgs field .",
    "if we assume that the central higgs antizero is located at the origin , the zero lines for the component of @xmath21 with helicity @xmath86 can then include :    * \\a ) @xmath89 lines from the origin , through a face , to infinity , * \\b ) @xmath90 lines from the origin , through an edge , to infinity , * \\c ) @xmath91 lines from a vertex to infinity , * \\d ) @xmath92 lines from the origin to a vertex .    for the three cases of regular polyhedra ,",
    "it is clear that these lines of zeros must all be radial and must be arranged symmetrically .",
    "equation  ( [ triangnumbers ] ) then implies that the various @xmath93 are integers and give the numbers of lines passing through an individual face , edge , or vertex .",
    "although the polyhedra with other values of @xmath0 do not have exact symmetry , we expect a similar result to hold when @xmath0 is sufficiently large .",
    "we will assume this to be the case .    consider a sphere centered at the origin and with radius large enough that it encloses all of the higgs zeros . because there are @xmath0 units of flux flowing outward through this sphere , @xmath83 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 must have @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 zeros on the sphere , respectively .",
    "this implies that @xmath97 if we assume that the various @xmath98 are independent of @xmath0 , this yields two conditions : @xmath99 from the coefficients of @xmath0 , and @xmath100 from the @xmath0-independent terms .",
    "these imply that @xmath101 and @xmath102    now consider a sphere centered at the origin , but lying inside the zeros of the higgs field . because this sphere encloses only the antizero at the origin , it should have @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and 0 zeros of @xmath83 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , respectively ; i.e. , each component of @xmath31 must have @xmath105 fewer zeros on this inner sphere than on the outer one .",
    "it immediately follows that @xmath106 , so that @xmath107    as a consistency check , consider a sphere that encloses a single vertex , with one unit of flux flowing outward ; we make take this sphere to be small enough that only lines connected to a vertex run through it .",
    "to count zeros on this sphere , @xmath31 must be decomposed into components @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 defined with respect to its center ; these must have 2 , 0 , and 4 zeros , respectively . on lines running radially outward to infinity from the vertex ,",
    "the @xmath111 are the same as the @xmath112 defined with respect to the origin . on the other hand , on lines running radially into the center from the vertex",
    "the roles of @xmath33 and @xmath34 are interchanged .",
    "furthermore , the reversal in direction of the outward normal changes the helicity , interchanging zeros and antizeros .",
    "the net result is the requirement that @xmath113 these conditions are satisfied by the @xmath114 and @xmath115 given by eqs .",
    "( [ kvabelian ] ) and ( [ kvprimeabelian ] ) .",
    "the above arguments uniquely determine the @xmath114 and @xmath115 , but leave some ambiguity as to the @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "this ambiguity can be resolved by choosing the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ faceedge ] ) that require the smallest total number of zero lines ; this criterion seems energetically reasonable , since it would tend to minimize the angular derivatives of the fields . with this choice ,",
    "the numbers of zero lines of the various types are given in table  [ triangular ] .",
    ".numbers of zero lines for solutions corresponding to polyhedra with triangular faces [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ dualtable ]    the results for the lines of zeros through the vertices are similar to those for the abelian case , and are consistent with the magnitude of @xmath118 having a maximum in these directions .",
    "the zero of @xmath34 decreases the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ radialbandw ] ) , while the zero of @xmath83 allows @xmath119 to be larger , again decreasing this contribution to the energy .",
    "the multiple zeros of @xmath83 and @xmath34 in the faces strongly suggest that @xmath46 has minima at the centers of the faces .",
    "the examples we have studied are not the only possible quasispherical solutions .",
    "one could certainly bring together a collection of monopoles to create an abelian bag with a hexagonal , rather than triangular , lattice . however , this lattice structure would be less regular , with zeros of @xmath33 on only some faces .",
    "alternatively , one could construct a lattice with more than one monopole at each vertex .",
    "there will also be hybrid bags , with some higgs zeros in the bag wall and some in the interior .",
    "consider for example , a solution with @xmath120 zeros arranged symmetrically around a sphere of radius @xmath121 and @xmath120 zeros arranged around a sphere of radius @xmath122 .",
    "for @xmath123 this would resemble the abelian bag , but for @xmath124 the fields would be similar to those of the non - abelian bag .",
    "it is unclear , however , what the range of possibilities is for the non - abelian bag , especially for the case where the higgs zeros are all at the origin .",
    "here , the lattice structure emerges from the nonlinear interactions of the fields , rather than being imposed by the location of higgs zeros at the surface of the bag .",
    "as we have already noted , the number of parameters that can be varied is far fewer than would be needed to specify an arbitrary lattice on the bag wall .",
    "there can also be nonspherical bags .",
    "one with an abelian interior can be constructed by assembling an irregular array of separated monopoles and bringing them together just till the point where their cores overlap and @xmath46 becomes exponentially small in the interior .",
    "this requires a nonuniform density of zeros on the bag wall , with the density being highest in the regions where the wall curvature is the greatest .",
    "more precisely , the distribution of zeros can be obtained by using the magnetic conductor picture of bolognesi , and requiring that the monopole density yield a constant dual magnetic potential in the interior of the bag .",
    "in fact , it is clear from this approach that , by reducing the monopole density on the bag wall , one can also obtain a nonspherical bag with a nonzero , but approximately uniform , higgs field in its interior .",
    "finally , note that as @xmath0 and , consequently , the bag radius become large , any finite region of the bag wall can be approximated by a plane , which we may take to be the @xmath125-@xmath126 plane . in the case of the abelian bag ,",
    "the wall would be similar to the monopole wall studied by ward  @xcite , except that it would contain a triangular , rather than a square , lattice of higgs zeros .",
    "on the side of the wall corresponding to the bag interior ( which we choose to be @xmath127 ) , the magnetic field and the higgs field would rapidly approach zero with increasing distance from the wall . on the other side , the variation of @xmath118 and @xmath46 with @xmath125 and",
    "@xmath126 would tend to vanish with distance from the wall .",
    "the former would approach a constant vector @xmath128 , while asymptotically the latter would increase linearly , with @xmath129 .",
    "although @xmath21 would be exponentially small outside the wall , it would not be precisely zero , and so the lines of zeros would persist .",
    "the analog of @xmath83 would be @xmath130 , while @xmath131 would correspond to @xmath66 . in the planar limit the constraints on the zeros of all three of these components are all the same . for a triangular lattice with @xmath132 , the analog of eq .",
    "( [ largespherek ] ) in the region @xmath133 , where there is a nonzero magnetic flux , is @xmath134 there is no net magnetic flux through any plane with negative @xmath135 , so for @xmath136 we have @xmath137 where @xmath138 refers to lines running from @xmath139 to a vertex . because lines of zeros can only end at a zero of the higgs field , @xmath140 and @xmath141 must be continuous in going though the wall .",
    "these equations are satisfied by the values in table  [ triangular ] as , of course , they must",
    ".    several possible variations on this picture immediately come to mind .",
    "one possibility is to have @xmath46 asymptotically constant , but nonzero , as @xmath142 ; this would be the planar limit of an abelian bag with radius greater than @xmath3 .",
    "corresponding to the case of nested shells of zeros would be a series of parallel planes , each with its own lattice of higgs zeros and monopole cores .",
    "for these solutions , @xmath46 is approximately linear in @xmath135 , but with a slope that changes as one passes through each wall . finally ,",
    "there are `` monopole sheet '' solutions  @xcite in which @xmath143 points outward on both sides of the wall ; these can not be realized as limits of a bag solution .",
    "the case of the non - abelian bag is perhaps more challenging , because there are no higgs zeros to fix the location of the wall .",
    "nevertheless , we can understand how a wall can arise by making some simplifying assumptions . to start ,",
    "let us consider fields that have been averaged over a lattice plaquette in the @xmath125 and @xmath126 directions , so that they are independent ( up to a gauge transformation ) of these variables , and only have nontrivial dependence on @xmath135 .",
    "it follows that @xmath118 is constant and has only a @xmath135 component , and hence that we can set @xmath144 .",
    "let us assume that @xmath130 also vanishes .",
