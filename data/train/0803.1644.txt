    "masers have proven to be a very powerful tool to study the morphology and kinematics of the gas in these environments , since their high surface brightness makes them excellent targets for radio interferometric observations , including the use of very long baseline interferometry with angular resolutions under 1 milliarcsecond ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , they allow to study the inner few au in young stellar objects and evolved stars , or 1 pc around active galactic nuclei .",
    "maser emission from sio , oh , and h@xmath0o are common in the circumstellar envelopes of oxygen - rich evolved stars . in the particular case of water masers , it was thought for some time that they disappear soon after ( @xmath2 years ) the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) mass - loss stops , so they were not expected to be associated with pne @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite reported the source k3 - 35 as the first confirmed case of a pn associated with water maser emission ( hereafter h@xmath0o - pn ) . later , during a search for this type of masers toward 26 additional pne , a new detection was found toward iras 17347@xmath13139 @xcite . in these two cases ,",
    "the association of the maser emission with the radio continuum emission from the ionized pn was confirmed via high - resolution interferometric observations using the very large array ( vla ) .",
    "recently , @xcite carried out a single - dish survey for water masers in post - agb stars and pne selected by their iras colors in the atlas of @xcite . in that survey ,",
    "water maser emission was found toward three objects previously cataloged as pne @xcite : iras 17443@xmath12949 , iras 17580@xmath13111 , and iras 18061@xmath12505 .",
    "however , given the relatively large angular separation between the reported peak position of the radio continuum emission @xcite and the infrared sources in the region , @xcite suggested that iras 17580@xmath13111 is probably not a pn .",
    "in this paper we present vla observations of maser emission of h@xmath0o and oh molecules , as well as radio continuum emission , toward iras 17443@xmath12949 , iras 17580@xmath13111 , and iras 18061@xmath12505 .",

    "we observed two oh maser transitions at @xmath3 ghz and the @xmath4 transition of the water molecule at @xmath5 ghz , as well as radio continuum emission at both @xmath6 and 22 ghz , toward iras 17443@xmath12949 , iras 17580@xmath13111 , and iras 18061@xmath12505 , using the vla of the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) .",

    "we note that a continuum dataset at 1.7 ghz , with a bandwidth of 25 mhz , was obtained simultaneously with the oh line at 1665 mhz .",

    "summarizing , we propose the following scenario for water maser emission during the evolution toward bipolar pne :    1 .   water - fountain phase .",
    "water masers preferentially trace a high - velocity jet and , in some cases , equatorial regions .",
    "this phase ends when the jet reaches regions with a density too low for water masers to be excited .",
    "2 .   h@xmath0o - pn phase .",
    "young bipolar pne , with its ionized structure extending along the lower - density bipolar cavity previously opened by jets .",
    "water masers could be excited mostly in the denser equatorial regions .",
    "whether there is a significant gap between these two phases , or they overlap , would probably depend on the mass of the progenitor star .",
    "however , since the progenitors of bipolar pne are thought to be relatively massive , their evolution would be fast , and ionization could start soon after the onset of bipolar mass - loss . in this case , the two phases mentioned above could overlap , and at some point of their evolution they could be pne with water - fountain characteristics .",
    "no water - fountain pn has been confirmed so far , but if any such object exists , our evolutionary scenario would indicate that it should have a high optical extinction ( thus making difficult its identification as a pn ) and the mass of its progenitor star should be in the upper ranges for pne ( @xmath50 m@xmath51 ) .",
    "we note that , in our scenario , not all water fountains may necessarily end up as h@xmath0o - pne , if the circumstellar envelope has been significantly cleared , even in equatorial regions , so that the conditions to pump water masers are not met anywhere in the circumstellar envelope by the time ionization starts .",
    "however , we think it likely that all h@xmath0o - pne have gone through a phase with collimated jets , probably shown as water fountains .",
    "the apparent non - association of water masers with radio continuum emission in iras 17443@xmath12949 and iras 17580@xmath13111 is also worth noting .",
    "both sources have been previously classified as pne on the basis of presence of radio continuum emission @xcite .",
    "the detection of oh emission made @xcite to include them in a special class of objects , ohpne .",
    "this type of objects , showing both oh and radio continuum emission , and strongly obscured or invisible in the optical , were suggested to form an evolutionary phase immediately before the formation of a full - blown pn .",
    "therefore , they are potentially key objects to study the early evolution of pne , including the processes that may give rise to the different morphologies observed in these nebulae .    our results , using an angular resolution higher than that available in the data presented by @xcite , suggest that in iras 17443@xmath12949 and iras 17580@xmath13111 , oh and h@xmath0o maser emission is not associated with the reported radio continuum emission and , therefore , they are not proper members of the ohpn class .",
    "we also note that @xcite reported radio continuum emission toward iras 17579@xmath13121 , and we have detected oh maser emission , although its angular separation to the radio continuum is too large to be associated , and thus , this source should not be considered an ohpn either",
    ".    therefore , it seems very important to carry high angular and spectral resolution studies of maser and radio continuum emission in all sources that have been proposed as candidates to being ohpne , before drawing any further conclusions about their properties as a group and their relevance as a link between the post - agb and pn phase . for some objects , such as k3 - 35 and iras 17347@xmath13139 ,",
    "observations with high enough angular resolution allow us to include them as proper members of the ohpn class .",
    "other prospective ohpne would probably need more detailed research before being unambiguously included within this class of objects .",
    "we have presented vla observations of oh ( 1612 and 1665 mhz ) and water masers ( 22235 mhz ) as well as radio continuum emission at 1.3 and 18 cm toward three possible water - maser - emitting pn : iras 17443@xmath12949 , iras 17560@xmath13111 , and iras 18061@xmath12505 .",
    "our main conclusions are as follow :    * we have detected water maser emission toward all target sources .",
    "oh maser emission at 1612 mhz is found associated with iras 17443@xmath12949 and iras 17560@xmath13111 , as well as toward two other objects within the observed fields : iras 17442@xmath12942 ( unknown nature ) and iras 17579@xmath13121 ( previously cataloged as a possible pn ) .",
    "oh maser emission at 1665 mhz is present in iras 17443@xmath12949 .",
    "radio continuum emission at 1.3 and 18 cm was detected only toward iras 18061@xmath12505 .",
    "* the water maser and radio continuum emission in iras 18061@xmath12505 is found within a region of 50 mas in size , coincident with the central region of the large ( @xmath29 size ) pn seen in the optical images .",
    "this confirms this object as the third known water - maser - emitting pn .",
    "the three confirmed h@xmath0o - pne have clear bipolar morphologies , which suggest that the water maser emission in these objects is not the remnant of the maser emission pumped by spherical winds in the agb phase .",
    "* for the other objects previously cataloged as possible pne ( iras 17443@xmath12949 , iras 17560@xmath13111 , and iras 17579@xmath13121 ) , the positions of the oh and/or h@xmath0o maser emission and those of the most likely near- and mid - infrared counterparts of the iras sources are not consistent with the positions of the radio continuum emission reported in the literature .",
    "therefore , these iras sources are not likely to trace pne .",
    "* we suggest an evolutionary scheme in which the precursors of h@xmath0o - pne would be `` water - fountain '' agb or post - agb stars .",
    "water maser emission in these fountains tend to trace highly collimated jets ( and equatorial structures in some cases ) .",
    "the jet clears the circumstellar envelope along the polar direction and , therefore , water masers in pne are found preferentially tracing equatorial structures . *",
    "although iras 17443@xmath12949 , iras 17560@xmath13111 , and iras 17579@xmath13121 would be classified as ohpne ( objects with both oh maser and radio continuum emission , which have been suggested to be extremely young pne ) based on single - dish observations , our interferometric data indicate that they are not proper members of this class .",
    "other prospective members of the ohpne class will also need to be confirmed with interferometric observations , before drawing further conclusions about the properties of this class of objects .",
