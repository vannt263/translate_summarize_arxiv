    "the first billion years after the big bang is a crucial epoch for understanding galaxy evolution because we can directly witness the initial stages of galaxy assembly .",
    "in contrast to present day , most galaxies at these epochs are thought to have only formed a small fraction of their final stellar mass , to be accreting pristine gas very actively from the cosmic web , to have low metal abundances , and to have been affected in their star formation properties by the pristine quality of the inter - stellar medium ( ism ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "we need observations of accurate diagnostics of the different physical phases of the gas .",
    "while luminous starbursting galaxies like submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ) and quasar hosts have been targeted for more than a decade at @xmath7 ( e.g. , @xcite ; see @xcite for a review ) , we are only now reaching the capability of investigating the ism in  normal \" star - forming galaxies that are more representative of the general galaxy population at these epochs , in particular lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ; @xcite , hereafter r14 ; @xcite , hereafter c15 ; @xcite ) .",
    "co excitation ladders have become a routine tool to investigate the physical conditions in molecular gas for starbursts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; however , the prospects for detection in normal galaxies at @xmath7 are not clear due to metallicity effects ( * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , co detections of lbgs to date , even exploiting strong lensing , have been limited to @xmath8 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "submillimeter fine - structure lines of the most abundant atomic metal species ( mainly c , n , o ) and their ions offer a unique angle and an unobscured view of the ism properties and conditions for star formation that is accessible to alma at high redshift .",
    "the far - infrared ( fir ) cooling lines , less affected by dust attenuation than optical lines , are powerful probes of the star formation activity , linking them directly to the surrounding medium from which stars are born . different lines , better in combination , can be used as diagnostics of the far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) flux , gas density , temperature , and filling factor of the photon - dominated regions ( pdrs ) and ionized regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recent surveys with the _ herschel space observatory _ provide the context for high redshift studies by giving benchmark sets of local galaxies , for which almost complete suites of fir lines yield solid constraints and allow detailed ism modeling ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) .    the ionization potential of nitrogen ( @xmath9ev ) is greater than that of hydrogen , therefore the singly ionized nitrogen lines , [ nii ] , probe the effect of uv photons emitted by massive young stars . since n@xmath10 is only present in the ionized medium it is a tracer of the extended low density envelope of hii regions , the ionized surfaces of dense atomic and molecular clouds and the warm ionized medium ( wim ) .",
    "@xcite find that the dominant source of [ nii ] emission in the milky way is not the wim , because the electron density they measure from [ nii ] fine - structure line ratios is two orders of magnitude higher than what is expected in the galactic diffuse medium , but it is expected that different types of galaxies , at different ages , will differ significantly in their ism phase structure .",
    "the high brightness of the [ cii ] @xmath11 m line makes it an ideal target at high redshift , where it allows dynamical studies and a probe into the ism properties and star formation .",
    "however , [ cii ] can originate from a range of gas phases and the line luminosity alone gives no direct information on its origin .",
    "in fact , low-@xmath12 observations have shown that while most of the [ cii ] luminosity comes from the atomic pdrs and diffuse cold neutral medium ( cnm ) , significant fractions also come from ionized gas regions and co - dark molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that the [ nii ] @xmath13 m line could be used in conjunction with [ cii ] @xmath11 m to separate the ionized from neutral fraction of the ism , because the latter is emitted by both weakly ionized and atomic gas .",
    "the transition critical densities of these two lines in ionized gas are very similar , implying that the line ratio for the ionized medium is nearly constant ( @xmath144 , @xcite ) and set by the relative carbon to nitrogen abundance , making [ nii ] a tracer of the ionized fraction of [ cii]-emitting gas .",
    "@xcite combined [ nii ] and [ cii ] galactic observations to determine the fraction of ionized gas contributing to the [ cii ] emission in the milky way for many lines of sight , finding this to vary mostly between 0.5 and 0.8 ( corresponding to [ cii]/[nii ] ratios @xmath15410 ) , where the galactic center line of sights have the smallest ionized fraction , probably due to higher gas densities .",
    "the [ nii ] @xmath13 m line is the tool of choice to characterize the low - density ionized ism at high redshift .",
    "thus , we here use alma to measure the [ nii ] properties of a sample spanning the variety of star - forming activity known at @xmath16 : a hyper - luminous nuclear starburst ( aztec-3 ; sfr@xmath16 ) , a dusty , high star formation rate lbg ( hz10 ; sfr@xmath17 ) and a typical , less star - forming lbg ( lbg-1 ; sfr@xmath18 ) .",

    "observations were carried out in cycle 3 , with 3247 usable @xmath30 m antennae under good weather conditions at 1.3 mm ( precipitable water vapor columns of @xmath31 mm for aztec-3 , @xmath32 mm for hz10 and 1.6@xmath33 mm for lbg-1 ) for 4 tracks between 2015 december 16 and 2016 january 14 , using 3 tracks in a compact configuration ( max .",

    "the [ nii ] line was centered in one of the spectral windows , in the upper sideband for aztec-3 and lbg-1 ( also covering the co(@xmath43=12@xmath4411 ) line in the lower sideband ) and in the lower sideband for hz10 , and the other three spectral windows were placed to provide contiguous coverage of the continuum emission within the available bandwidth .",
    "the common astronomy software application ( casa ) version 4.5 was used for data reduction and analysis .",
    "all images and mosaics were produced with the clean algorithm , using natural weighting for maximal sensitivity .",
    "we also apply an outer taper of @xmath45k@xmath46 to the lbg-1 observations that included unwanted long baselines ( @xmath47 m ) .",
    "aztec-3 and lbg-1 are separated by only @xmath48 , so their individual pointings were imaged both separately and together in a mosaic .",
    "this significantly improves our sensitivity for aztec-3 ( primary beam correction factor of @xmath150.7 in the mosaic ) , due to the longer on - source time of the lbg-1 pointing .",
    "we therefore extracted the aztec-3 line and continuum fluxes from the mosaic , while lbg-1 was analyzed in the single pointing , after confirming that the results were equivalent in both cases .",
    "the mosaic has a synthesized beam size of @xmath49 and the rms noise is @xmath50mjy beam@xmath23 at the position of aztec-3 in @xmath51 km s@xmath23 wide channels and @xmath52mjy beam@xmath23 at the position of lbg-1 .",

    "the cycle-1 observations were taken on 2013 november 15 - 16 in band 7 as part of a larger project ; we here provide a brief description of the data that we have re - analyzed from c15 .",
    "the hz10 pointing resulted in @xmath62min on source with 25 usable antennae .",
    "ganymede was observed as flux calibrator , j05384405 was observed as bandpass calibrator , and j1058 + 0133 was observed as amplitude / phase gain calibrator .",

    "pallas was observed as flux calibrator , and the bandpass and gain calibrators were the same as for the hz10 observations .",
    "in both cases the correlator was set up to target the expected frequency of the [ cii ] line and to provide continuous coverage of the continuum emission in adjacent spectral windows with channels of @xmath64mhz in time division mode ( tdm ) .",
    "we have re - calibrated these archival data and the cycle-0 data described by r14 using the scripted pipelines on the archive after appropriately modifying them to be executed with casa 4.5 and using the updated flux calibration tables from butler - jpl - horizons 2012 for solar system objects .",
    "this modification lowers the fluxes of the cycle-0 data compared to r14 by @xmath65 because of a corresponding lowering of the assumed flux of callisto compared to butler - jpl - horizons 2010 .",
    "we have furthermore modified the default flags at the edges of the spectral windows that cover the [ cii ] line in hz10 , to only flag two channels per window .",
    "this is sufficient because the bandpass calibration shows a sharp drop - off , and by imaging both spectral windows we recover the full line emission .",
    "we have produced image cubes and continuum maps using the clean task with natural weighting in casa 4.5 .",
    "lbg-1 was imaged by mosaicking cycle-0 and cycle-1 data as part of the clean process .",
    "aztec-3 was imaged separately using the cycle-0 data for the single pointing close to the source , after checking that mosaicking the second pointing ( centered near lbg-1 ) does not significantly alter the results due to the high signal - to - noise ratio of the continuum and line detection in this source .",
    "we detect the [ nii ] line ( table  [ table_lines ] ) in aztec-3 at 5@xmath66 confidence in the mosaic of the aztec-3 pointing and the lbg-1 pointing ( the significance is 3.5@xmath66 in the aztec-3 data alone ) . the integrated line map ( fig .",

    "this method yields a lower bound on the [ cii ] flux from the [ nii]-emitting region .",

    "the fir luminosity implied by our fits is strongly dependent on the assumed dust temperature , which is poorly constrained by our measurements ; since the dust emissivity index @xmath91 and the dust temperature are degenerate on the rayleigh - jeans tail of the dust emission .",
    "we assume optically thin fir emission and impose weak gaussian priors on the dust temperature ( @xmath92k ) and @xmath91 ( @xmath93 ) based on the seds of local dwarf galaxies @xcite and compatible with milky way values , to obtain dust temperatures of @xmath94k for hz10 and @xmath95k for lbg-1",

    "in fact , the remaining uncertainty on the upper end of the dust temperature probability distribution , and thus the fir luminosity , implies that  normal \" systems like lbg-1 may have higher than previously estimated fir luminosity ( c15 ) , and thus may remain consistent with the smc irx@xmath102 relation between the infrared and ultraviolet luminosity ratio and the ultraviolet continuum slope discussed in c15 , despite apparently falling below when  average \" dust temperatures are assumed .     and",

    "of particular note are the strong density effect ( high density implies higher line ratio ) and the slight rise of the ratio for hard radiation and high intensities due to further ionization of n@xmath10 to n@xmath107 . ]",
    "in order to aid the interpretation of our observations we have run a grid of cloudy models using version 13.03 @xcite .",
    "we simulate constant pressure clouds with spherical geometry ( although the inner radius of @xmath108kpc that we adopt implies the hii region and pdr are close to the plane - parallel regime ) , extending up to @xmath109=10 to include both hii regions and pdrs .",
    "the input spectrum is taken from starburst99 models @xcite with geneva stellar tracks @xcite , default parameters for solar metallicity stellar atmospheres and a burst of star formation in order to use the age of the starburst as a proxy for hardness of the radiation field .",
    "we also explore the effect of low stellar metallicity tracks ( @xmath110 , i.e. @xmath111 ) on our results but find little difference for the main quantities of interest .",
    "we adopt all gas element abundances for solar metallicity from @xcite and include orion - like dust and magnetic fields ( intensity of @xmath112 g at the inner edge , as appropriate for the orion nebula according to the cloudy documentation ) .",
    "we fix the cloud inner edge gas density and ionization parameter ( u ) for starburst ages of 1 myr and 10 myr , and vary both parameters in a grid . figure  [ cloudy ] shows the integrated line luminosities predicted by our cloudy simulations from large , single clouds illuminated by a central starburst . while the precise values are model - dependent and should not be directly compared to the measured values ( and depend on the precise carbon to nitrogen abundance ratio and gas density structure ) we examine the main trends to gain insight into the major factors affecting the [ cii]/[nii ] line luminosity ratio .",
    "the main trend is a clear density dependence , with higher density ( for a fixed ionization parameter , u ) corresponding to higher @xmath3}$]/@xmath113}$ ] .",
    "although this effect does not appear straightforward to interpret , we suggest some elements that are likely to play a role .",
    "the effect that we see in these models is probably partly caused by a saturation of the [ nii ] total emission with increasing density , i.e. , a lack of substantial increase due to the low critical density ( @xmath114@xmath105 ) of the [ nii ] transition . at the same time",
    "the cloudy models show a steady increase of the [ cii ] emission from the pdr with the simultaneous increase in density and radiation field ( an increase in density at constant u implies a proportional increase of the input stellar flux ) .",
    "the gas density in the pdr is higher than in the hii region but not as high as one might expect from simple gas pressure balance ; this is due to the magnetic pressure becoming important in the pdr for some of the low and intermediate density models . as a consequence the density in the pdr approaches the [ cii ] critical density for neutral gas from below and only crosses it for the high density models , with [ cii ] saturating at higher hii gas densities than naively expected .",
    "thus , the increase of the gas density in the pdr , together with the increase in far - uv flux ( @xmath115 ) due to keeping u constant , implies stronger pdr [ cii ] emission with approximately unchanged [ nii ] emission ; which causes an increase in [ cii]/[nii ] ratio as a function of model density .    another important effect controlling the line ratio is the conversion of [ nii ] to [ niii ] in high ionization conditions ( caused by both high u and hard radiation ) .",
    "its effects can be seen in isolation from the difference between the two ages of the burst of star formation ( a proxy for hardness of the incident radiation ) since we find that [ niii ] is very important in the 1 myr case , while it is negligible in the 10 myr models .",
    "its main contribution is clear : while in the low - hardness case an increase in u favors [ nii ] emission over pdr tracers ( like [ cii ] ) , this trend reverses for hard radiation , when the increased [ niii ] implies a deficit of [ nii ] emission with increasing ionization parameter .",
    "we have also run equivalent cloudy simulations with stellar radiation input produced by the lowest available stellar metallicity geneva tracks to investigate the approximate effect of a young stellar population , as expected at high redshift .",
    "the effects on the line ratio of interest do not significantly affect our interpretation ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "however it is possible that an inclusion of more realistic stellar population models , e.g. , accounting for stellar binary effects which could produce higher effective stellar temperatures , may have a greater impact , and requires further investigation .",
    "we have not attempted changing the gas - phase metallicity because this would further complicate the interpretation of the model results ( e.g. , given the uncertainty in the effect of metallicity on the carbon - to - nitrogen ratio ) .",
    "it is also possible that the structure of the ism might be significantly altered by radically different stellar populations and star - forming conditions , which would therefore require changing the standard geometry of hii regions around recently formed stars , surrounded by atomic pdr gas , assumed here , which could systematically change the model results .",
    "for example , @xcite explore the effect on fir emission lines of time - dependent cloud photo - evaporation , and suggest that equilibrium models might be systematically incorrect .",
    "aztec-3 is one of the most intensely star - forming starbursts known at @xmath7 ( not amplified by gravitational lensing ) .",
    "it is centrally located in one of the earliest galaxy proto - clusters known ( showing an 11-fold over - density of lbgs and color - selected galaxies within @xmath117mpc , suggesting a halo mass @xmath118 ; * ? ? ? * ) and is known to be compact and dusty @xcite .",
    "its very compact starburst ( @xmath119kpc in diameter ) , leads to a high dust temperature ( @xmath120@xmath121k ; r14 ) , indicating extreme conditions even among high redshift smgs .",
    "we have detected the [ nii ] line in aztec-3 , with a measured [ nii ] luminosity of @xmath122 implying @xmath113}/l_{\\rm fir}=(2.6\\pm 1.0 ) \\times 10^{-5}$ ] , which is very low compared to local ( u)lirgs @xcite . @xcite and @xcite argue that low values of [ nii ] luminosity to fir emission correlate with warm dust in local galaxy samples .",
    "this is consistent with the intense radiation field and high dust temperature already found by sed modeling of aztec-3 ( r14 ) .",
    "the [ nii]/fir deficit can be interpreted as the product of two effects which can be studied in isolation : the [ cii]/[nii ] ratio , which is dependent on the relation between ionized and neutral gas ; and the [ cii]/fir ratio , which characterizes the gas heating efficiency .",
    "the latter was discussed by r14 , where it was interpreted as analogous to the deficit found in local ulirgs ( e.g. , @xcite ) . on the other hand",

    "<S> we report interferometric measurements of [ nii ] @xmath0 fine - structure line emission from a representative sample of three galaxies at @xmath1@xmath2 using the atacama large ( sub)millimeter array ( alma ) . </S>",
    "<S> these galaxies were previously detected in [ cii ] and far - infrared continuum emission and span almost two orders of magnitude in star formation rate ( sfr ) . </S>",
    "<S> our results show at least two different regimes of ionized inter - stellar medium properties for galaxies in the first billion years of cosmic time , separated by their @xmath3}/l_{\\rm [ nii]}$ ] ratio . </S>",
    "<S> we find extremely low [ nii ] emission compared to [ cii ] ( @xmath3}/l_{\\rm [ nii]}=68^{+200}_{-28}$ ] ) from a  typical \" @xmath4 star - forming galaxy , likely directly or indirectly ( by its effect on the radiation field ) related to low dust abundance and low metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> the infrared - luminous modestly star - forming lyman break galaxy ( lbg ) in our sample is characterized by an ionized - gas fraction ( @xmath3}/l_{\\rm [ nii]}\\lesssim20)$ ] typical of local star - forming galaxies and shows evidence for spatial variations in its ionized - gas fraction across an extended gas reservoir . </S>",
    "<S> the extreme sfr , warm and compact dusty starburst aztec-3 shows an ionized fraction higher than expected given its star - formation rate surface density ( @xmath3}/l_{\\rm [ nii]}=22\\pm8 $ ] ) suggesting that [ nii ] dominantly traces a diffuse ionized medium rather than star - forming hii regions in this type of galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> this highest redshift sample of [ nii ] detections provides some of the first constraints on ionized and neutral gas modeling attempts and on the structure of the inter - stellar medium at @xmath16 in  normal \" galaxies and starbursts . </S>"
