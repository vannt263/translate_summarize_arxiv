    "the study of nucleon resonances is an important topic of hadron physics .",
    "the information about nucleon resonance is mainly extracted from the pion - nucleon scattering especially in the early stage of the study of nucleon resonance  @xcite . based on a large number of nucleon resonances found in the experiment ,",
    "the constituent quark model ( cqm ) was developed and achieved great success in the explanation about the property of nucleon resonance  @xcite .",
    "however , the predicted nucleon resonances in the cqm are much more than the ones found in the experiment , which is the so - called `` missing resonance '' problem .",
    "one explanation about this problem is that the decay ratio of `` missing resonance '' is very small in the usual experimental detected channels , such as the pion - nucleon channel .",
    "hence , the channels more than the pion - nucleon channel , such as @xmath8 and strange channels , attract much attentions .",
    "a mount of experimental data of the kaon photoproduction companied by a ground strange baryon @xmath9 or @xmath0 have been accumulated in the recent years  @xcite . however , the study about the kaon photoproduction with a strange baryon resonance is scarce .",
    "very recently , the clas collaboration released their experimental data about the kaon photoproduction with @xmath0(1385 ) , @xmath10 and @xmath11 with high precision  @xcite , which provide an opportunity to study nucleon resonances in these channels .",
    "the strong decays of nucleon resonances to @xmath0(1385 ) , @xmath10 or @xmath11 with kaon meson have been studied in the cqm  @xcite .",
    "combined with the theoretical prediction about the radiative decay  @xcite , one can make a rough estimation which nucleon resonances play important roles in a certain photoproduction process .",
    "for example , the large decay widths to @xmath12 and @xmath13 suggest that @xmath14 should be easy to be found in the kaon photoproduction with @xmath10 , which has been confirmed by many theoretical analysis of the @xmath10 photoproduction data  @xcite .",
    "the cqm prediction suggests a large decay ratio of the @xmath15 state @xmath16 and the @xmath6 state @xmath17(2000 ) in @xmath18 decay channel@xcite .",
    "hence it is interesting to study the roles played by such states in the @xmath0(1385 ) photoproduction .",
    "there only exist some old experimental data about the @xmath0(1385 ) photoproduction with low precision , which were obtained before last seventies  @xcite .",
    "the leps collaboration also released some results in this channel but only at extreme forward angles  @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , the theoretical studies are also scarce . in ref .",
    "@xcite the @xmath0(1385 ) photoproduction has been studied in an effective lagrangian approach based on the preliminary data from clas collaboration .",
    "however , due to the absence of the constraint of the precise data large discrepancies at low energies between the experimental data and the theoretical predictions can be found in the differential cross section released by the clas collaboration  @xcite . in this work , we will analyze the new clas data within a regge - plus - resonance approach and investigate the roles played by nucleon resonances .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "after introduction , we will present the effective lagrangian used in this work and reggeized treatment for @xmath2 channel .",
    "the gauge invariance will be also discussed in this section .",
    "the numerical results for the cross section will be given and compared with the experimental data in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "finally , the paper ends with a brief summary .",
    "the four types of interaction mechanism , the @xmath19 channel , the @xmath3 channel , the @xmath2 channel and the contact term for the @xmath10 photoproduction from nucleon with @xmath20 are presented in fig .",

    "for the born @xmath19 channel , @xmath2 channel and contact term , the lagrangians involved are given as below , @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath21 , @xmath20 , @xmath25 are the photon , nucleon , kaon and @xmath26 fields and the charge of nucleon @xmath27 for proton and neutron in the unit of @xmath28 with @xmath29 being the fine - structure constant .",
    "the anomalous magnetic moment @xmath30 for proton .",
    "@xmath31 and @xmath32 are the masses of kaon and nucleon .",
    "the coupling constant for @xmath33 vertex can be related to the @xmath34 coupling by the su(3 ) flavor symmetry relation , and the value @xmath35 can be obtained  @xcite .    the @xmath2 channel for the @xmath0(1385 ) photoproduction occurs through both @xmath20 and @xmath36 exchanges . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the contribution from the @xmath36 exchange is negligible at energies @xmath37 gev with the reasonable coupling constant .",
    "hence only @xmath20 exchange will be considered in this work .",
    "the @xmath3 channel diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ pic : dia ] contains intermediate hyperons .",
    "the effective lagrangians for these diagrams are @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath22 stands for a hyperon with spin-@xmath40 carrying a mass @xmath41 . for the intermediate @xmath42 state ,",

    "the coupling constant @xmath45 can be determined by flavor su(3 ) symmetry relation , which gives value @xmath46  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 exchange is negligible due to to the small coupling constant determined from su(3 ) symmetries  @xcite . besides",
    ", the effect of higher resonances can be included through reggeized treatment . due to the large uncertainty at backward angles of the clas experimental data and much larger masses of @xmath9 and @xmath0 baryons compared with the mass of @xmath20 in the @xmath2 channel",

    "the gauge invariance can be guaranteed as the @xmath47 and @xmath10 photoproductions  @xcite .",
    "the effect of the hadron internal structure can be reflected by the form factor added at each vertex .",

    "the cutoff @xmath57 for @xmath19 , @xmath3 or @xmath2 channel should be about 1  gev and will be set as free parameter in this work .",
    "we introduce @xmath20 reggeized treatment as following to describe the behavior of differential cross section of the @xmath58 photoproduction at high photon energies  @xcite , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the slope of the trajectory and the scale factor @xmath61 is fixed at 1 gev@xmath62 .",

    "the @xmath36 reggeized treatment is analogous .",
