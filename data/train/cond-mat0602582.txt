    "atom lasers are sources of coherent matter waves that use an ultra - cold gas of trapped alkalii atoms as a reservoir from which coherent pulses of thousands of atoms are extracted . since the experimental achievement of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in gases @xcite ,",
    "several methods have been proposed to deliver atoms from their confinement .",
    "the first of these devices used short radio - frequency pulses as outcoupling mechanism , flipping the spins of some of the atoms to release them from the trap @xcite . later , other atom lasers were built leading to pulsed , semi - continuous or single - atom coherent sources @xcite .",
    "the quality of an atom laser is given by the amount of atoms that can be delivered from the trap and by the purity of the emission process .",
    "concerning this point , it has been recently shown @xcite that spin - flipping techniques present serious limitations in the number of atoms that can be emitted .",
    "this effect is related with the fluctuations at high flux due to the fact that the output - coupling mechanism populates all accessible zeeman states .",
    "this constitutes a strong drawback for practical applications of atom lasers in high precision measurements like matter wave gyroscopes @xcite .    on the other hand , an atomic soliton laser using the mechanism of modulational instability",
    "was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this case",
    ", the emission is obtained by the combination of purely nonlinear effects in the atom cloud and the relaxation of the trap , it being necessary that the total number of particles in the cloud exceeds a critical threshold .",
    "this system has the advantage over standard atom lasers of producing matter wave pulses in the form of _ solitons _",
    "@xcite , a kind of nonlinear waves generated by a perfect balance between dispersive and nonlinear effects , yielding to robust wave packets that propagate without shape distortion @xcite .",
    "other types of atom laser based on nonlinear effects have been proposed @xcite .    however , although one could extract a few coherent solitons from a bose - einstein condensate by the mechanism of modulational instability , the final output would be very limited since the number of atoms per pulse generated by this phenomenon is only a small fraction of the initial number of atoms in the condensate due to collapse processes .",
    "moreover , the number of solitons generated is not large and half of them would be directed backwards .",
    "finally , the trap must be destroyed for outcoupling and the pulses travel at different speeds once the trap is removed .",
    "thus , it is important to discuss new outcoupling mechanisms for atom lasers .",
    "this is specially interesting since the techniques for generating becs with large numbers of particles and their physical properties are nowadays well established and the current challenges in the field face the design of practical devices @xcite .    in a recent work @xcite a novel outcoupling mechanism for an atom laser",
    "has been proposed .",
    "the method is based on the fact that a spatial variation of the scattering length ( @xmath0 ) ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) can be used to extract a controllable train of up to several hundreds of atomic solitons from a bec without altering the trap properties . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a simple model for the spatial variation of the scattering length ( a step function ) was used in order to introduce the basic ideas and illustrate the phenomenon .",
    "however , for the practical realization of such device , a deeper analysis must be done , including studying the role of more physical distributions of the spatial dependence of @xmath0 , and the temporal control of the output by the considering an additional time dependence of the scattering length . in this paper",
    "we consider these aspects of the soliton emission process which are relevant for the theoretical understanding and experimental demonstration of this new type of atom laser .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in section [ ii ] , we present the configuration of the system and the mathematical model to be used for the theoretical analysis . in section [ iii ]",
    "we study the mechanism of emission of single solitons . to do so we first study a simplified model for which an analytical study can be done .",
    "we also analyze theoretically a more realistic scheme by means of variational methods and numerical simulations , for gaussian - shaped spatial variations of the scattering length . finally , in section [ iv ] we study the effect of temporal variations of the scattering length induced by pulsed beams .",
    "as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we assume a bec which is strongly confined in the transverse directions ( @xmath1 ) and weakly along the longitudinal one ( @xmath2 ) leading to a _ cigar - shaped _ configuration",
    ". we will consider the effect of a spatial variation of the scattering length along @xmath2 from positive ( or zero ) to negative values . in principle",
    "this can be done by magnetic @xcite or optical @xcite means , for instance by using an appropriate laser beam that shines one of the edges of the condensate as in the sketch of the system plotted in fig.[fig1 ] . in this case",
    "the region of negative scattering length can be varied and displaced along the condensate by simply moving the laser beam .",
    "the variation of @xmath0 can also be controlled in time by using pulsed laser beams .",
    "similar arguments apply for magnetically controlled scattering length , although the control of laser allows for faster and easier manipulation of the spatial variations of the scattering length . in any case what it is important is that we will depart from the model of step - like spatial variation of the scattering of ref .",
    "@xcite to more realistically achievable smoother dependences .",
    "when the zone in which the scattering length is managed to negative values overlaps with the wings of the atom cloud , as in fig.[fig1 ] , the bec feels a repulsive force whose strength depends on the number of atoms in the condensate . when this effect is large enough , the trap is overcome and part of the cloud is delivered and emitted outwards .",
    "when the condensate refills the gap left out by the outgoing pulse the process starts again and a new soliton is emitted .",
    "this process would continue while there is a large enough remnant of atoms in the trap and would lead to a soliton burst escaping from the bec .",
    "therefore , we will consider that the cloud of @xmath3 equal bosons of mass @xmath4 is tightly trapped in ( @xmath1 ) by a harmonic potential @xmath5 of frequency @xmath6 and weakly confined along @xmath2 by the effect of an optical dipole trap @xmath7@xcite that can be produced by a laser beam of a given width along @xmath2 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "thus , we have @xmath8,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the depth of the shallow optical dipole potential and @xmath10 its characteristic width along @xmath2 .",
    "the choice of a shallow gaussian trap is very important , since the goal is to obtain outcoupling of solitons along the @xmath2 axis .",
    "this can be achieved with a potential barrier that can be overcome by the self - interaction effects .",
    "the dynamics of the previous system in the mean field limit is described by a gross - pitaevskii equation of the form : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the condensate wavefunction , and its norm @xmath13 gives the number of particles .",
    "the coefficient @xmath14 depends on the scattering length @xmath0 , which characterizes the 2-body interactions between atoms . as commented previously",
    ", we will consider @xmath0 to be a function of @xmath2 with a localized region in which it becomes negative .",
    "we will concentrate on situations in which the spatial size of the ground state of the optical dipole trap is much larger than the ground state of the transverse harmonic potential leading to effectively one - dimensional dynamics .",
    "in this situation we can describe the dynamics of the condensate in the quasi - one dimensional limit as given by a factorized wavefunction of the form @xcite @xmath15 , satisfying @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the transverse size of the cloud , @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the time measured in units of the inverse of the radial trapping frequency and @xmath20 is the effective interaction coefficient .    as an example we will present specific numbers in this paper corresponding to @xmath21li , using the experimental parameters of ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 @xmath27 and times ranging from @xmath28 to @xmath29 . however , our results hold for different atomic species like @xmath30rb and @xmath31cs , with adequate parameters .",
    "as we have pointed before , we will consider a situation in which the scattering length is changed on a localized region near the edge of the optical trap . in that case , it is possible to understand the basics of the phenomenon of the emission of a single soliton using a simple model .",
    "we consider a square trapping potential of width @xmath10 and depth @xmath9 and a step - like scattering length , as it is illustrated in fig .",
    "mathematically    @xmath32    and @xmath33    although this model is a rough simplification of the more realistic situations to be described in detail later on , it captures the big picture of the process .",
    "in fact , this model can be solved analytically , by simply calculating the solution of the schrdinger equation in the three zones .",
    "defining @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , we get @xmath37 & -l < z < l\\\\ a_3 \\ \\text{sech}[(z - z_3)\\gamma_3 ] & z > l   \\end{cases}\\ ] ] as it can be appreciated in the insets of fig .",

    "this effect may have applications in the control of the emitted solitons once outcoupled and in the design of practical devices like laser tweezers for atoms @xcite .    another interesting consideration in order to construct experimentally wide regions of negative scattering length , is to use the superposition of several mutually incoherent laser beams as it shown in fig .",

    "[ fig6 ] ( a ) the region of negative scattering length is generated by a single outcoupling beam as in fig [ fig5 ] c ) . as a result of the finite width of the outcoupling beam , the atomic soliton rebounds at the boundary as is redirected backwards to the reservoir . in fig .",

    "we have also observed in the numerical simulations that the soliton emission is more efficient if the scattering length varies abruptly in space .",
    "moreover , for avoiding the return of the solitons once they have been emitted , it is desirable that the shape of the outcoupling beam be asymmetric . in the case in which laser beams are used to control the scattering length",
    "this could be achieved by partially overlapping parallel lasers .",
    "in order to generate a extended negative scattering length region , more lasers can be added or the outcoupling beam can be displaced following the motion of the emitted soliton .",

    "the spatial profiles are step functions .",
    "as it can be seen in the pictures , depending on the duration of the pulse ( i.e. : the size of the flat top ) , the quality of the outcoupling varies , yielding to a broadening in the profile of the solitons as the nonlinearity vanishes . in some cases",
    "the solitons can fuse after the emission . by varying the time that @xmath0 is switched to a negative value , it is possible to obtain a periodic reconstruction of the individual solitons .",
    "the results are summarized in fig.[fig7](c).in this simulation , the spatial profile of the outcoupling beam is a step function that is modulated in time with a gaussian ramp connected at its maximum to a flat top of variable size that ends with a final gaussian decay .",

    "a ) corresponds to a continuous beam ( i.e. : no modulation ) , in b ) and c ) we applied three pulses with @xmath86 in both cases and @xmath87 and @xmath88 , respectively .",
    "the rest of the parameters are the same as in [ fig5 ] a ) .",
    "in summary , we have analyzed in detail the recently proposed mechanism for outcoupling coherent matter wave pulses from a bose - einstein condensate . by using this technique it could be possible to obtain a regular and controllable emission of atomic soliton bursts that are easily extracted by an adequate choice of the control parameters .",
    "the particular shape of the spatial dependence of the scattering length used for outcoupling the solitons does not affect essentially the emission process although it is of higher purity for sharp variations of the scattering length and for regions of negative scattering length of finite extent the soliton is reflected back when it reaches the boundaries .",
    "the temporal control of the solitons can be easily implemented with pulsed beams .",
    "we must stress that our results hold for different atomic species like @xmath30rb and @xmath31cs , with adequate parameters . for the case of @xmath31cs",
    "the scattering length can be controlled with high precision and can be done negative and large .",
    "this could provide a system in which a very high number of solitons could be generated .    using the mechanism proposed in this paper a train of even several hundred of solitons",
    "could be coherently outcoupled from a condensate .",
