    "it is well known that the majority of stars form in aggregates or clusters @xcite , which often do not survive as bound systems after early dynamical evolution and/or gas removal . as star formation progresses from early , more filamentary structures ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "numerical simulations suggest that virialized star clusters can form before gas expulsion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite showed that the use of multiple indicators at once helps disentangle effects of dynamical evolution from effects related to the choice of initial conditions .",
    "in @xcite ( hereafter ) we presented an analysis of the spatial distribution ( as well as dynamical status ) of sources in the orion nebula cluster ( onc ) .",
    "we introduced a metric to measure the degree of angular subclustering in centrally concentrated clusters : _ the angular dispersion parameter _ ( ) , building on previous work by @xcite .",
    "this quantity represents the dispersion of stellar counts measured in @xmath2 equal sectors from the cluster center , normalized to the standard deviation expected from poisson statistics .",
    "thus , @xmath3 for an azimuthally random distribution , and increases in the presence of substructure .",
    "in contrast to other popular indicators of substructure , e.g. , the minimum spanning tree @xmath1 parameter @xcite ,  is sensitive to minute deviations from isotropy within a clearly defined stellar grouping , rather than only distinguishing among centrally concentrated versus substructured populations . in the onc",
    "we detect a clear radial dependence of , with the core being systematically smoother than the outskirts , which we interpret as result of dynamical processing .    in this paper",

    "[ section : analysis ] reviews our methods to calculate the center and the  radial variation for each cluster .",
    "we outline our findings in  [ section : results ] .",
    "we adopt the dataset from the mystix survey @xcite . this survey collected data from the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory , and infrared photometry from the _ united kingdom infrared telescope _ ( ukirt ) and the _ spitzer space telescope _ on 20 galactic star - forming regions with typical ages of 13  myr @xcite . from all the these sources",
    ", @xcite published statistical memberships based on multiple observational information : x - ray classification and infrared excess from circumstellar material .",
    "we thus restricted our analysis to these sources , for a total of 31,784 probable pms stars . due to sensitivity limits and the restrictive criteria of membership assignment",
    ", the mystix sample is incomplete especially for low - mass stars .",
    "however , we assume that the sample is representative of the spatial distribution of sources in each region .",
    "we exclude from our analysis two mystix clusters : the trifid nebula and w4 , which respectively are characterized by low number statistics , or lack a definite central concentration , two aspects which undermine the diagnostic power of .",
    "some of the regions enclose multiple separated star clusters ; @xcite identify mystix subclusters using collections of isothermal ellipsoids .",
    "we do not use their identification of subclusters since some of these groupings are poorly populated , unsuitable for  analysis , and in many cases they indicate a stratification or core - halo distribution which could simply indicate that these systems are not well fit by a single isothermal ellipsoid . instead , we look for clusters using a nearest neighbor algorithm identifying overdensities at a scale of 0.065  pc .",
    "we isolate 22 subclusters in 18 star - forming regions , as shown in figures [ figure : radec1 ] and [ figure : radec2 ] . for each cluster",

    "for a full description of the angular dispersion parameter  we refer the reader to ; here we summarize its definition and characteristics . given a circular ( or elliptical ) aperture , or one of some concentric annuli enclosed in it ,",
    "the area is divided in @xmath2 sectors of equal area , each containing @xmath4 stars .",
    "is then computed as : @xmath5 this parameter is subject to a statistical error , which does not depend only on the number of sectors @xmath2 , and can be decreased further by averaging all possible orientations of the sector pattern .",
    "for an isotropic centrally concentrated cluster , @xmath3 . given a substructured morphology the actual value of @xmath6 depends on the number of stars in each annular region , which therefore must be fixed for a meaningful comparison between regions . we choose 60 stars per annulus as a compromise between statistical significance of number counts , and radial resolution .",
    "an example of the subdivision of the onc population in circular or elliptical annuli is shown in the first panel of figure 1 .",
    "depending on @xmath2 ,  measures a given angular mode of substructure .",
    "as default for our analysis we consider @xmath7 , but also test the effect in our results assuming @xmath8 or 9 .    as shown in , ellipticity causes  to increase even for a smooth distribution , mimicking the effect of substructure , and , e.g. , was found to be a main contributor to the measured @xmath6 .",
    "this is because at a given distance ( in circular symmetry ) from the center the number counts are higher along the major axis and lower along the minor axis .",
    "a similar bias was also shown to affect the mst @xmath1 parameter @xcite .",
    "thus in we generalized the  method to measure subclustering adopting elliptical symmetry ",
    "i.e. , dividing the population into elliptical concentric sectors .",
    "for the sample here , we thus determined elongation by fitting simple 2d plummer models to each cluster , leaving ellipticity and semi - major axis position angles as free parameters . in figures [ figure :",
    "radec1 ] and [ figure : radec2 ] we display the 18 mystix regions , highlighting the subclusters selected for this study .",
    "the red circles denote the maximum useful apertures ( @xmath9 ) , and the blue ellipse the best fit elliptical model inside each of them .",
    "we measure the radial profile of @xmath10 for our identified mystix subclusters .",
    "given the intrinsic difference in their number of members ( from @xmath11 to @xmath12 members , see table [ table ] ) , we adopt two choices : a ) the _ high resolution _ profile , in which for both circular and elliptical symmetry we divide the populations in all concentric annuli containing 60 stars within @xmath9 , and b ) the _ low resolution _ profile , where we consider 3 radii : 1 ) @xmath13 , i.e. , the smallest circle from each center containing 60 stars ; 2 ) the mean of @xmath10 within the half - mass radius @xmath14 ; 3 ) the mean of @xmath10 within the cluster radius @xmath9 .",
    "since the mystix fields of view are not uniform , and because of our constraints (  [ section : data ] ) to avoid overlapping of subclusters in regions with multiple central concentrations , both @xmath9 and @xmath14 retain some arbitrariness . also , the mystix cluster sample is heterogenous in that individual regions , depending on their distance and dust extinction , have different levels of ( in)completeness .",
    "as we show in  [ section : results ] , such limitations are insufficient to erase the general qualitative trends we detect .",
    "in table [ table ] we report for each cluster the three radial bins of our low resolution profile , together with the total number of stars , annuli , and the average @xmath15 within @xmath16 , all assuming circular symmetry . in nearly all cases",
    "@xmath17 , indicating that none of these regions has reached an isotropic spatial distribution of sources . in some cases ( e.g. , the clustered concentration of members in the rosetta nebula ) ,",
    "the value is fairly small ; in others ( e.g. , ngc1893 ) @xmath10 traces the visibly irregular spatial distribution of sources .",
    "we look for systematic correlations in the degree of substructure with distance from the center and with surface density , employing the pearson product - moment correlation coefficient and the spearman correlation rank statistics .",
    "specifically , we would expect that the core of the clusters , where the density is higher , would have reached a smoother distribution due to a higher rate of stellar interactions ( scaling as the dynamical time or the free - fall time , @xmath18 ) . in table",
    "[ table ] we also report the one - sided @xmath19values corresponding to a chance probability that either a positive trend of @xmath10 versus @xmath20 , or a negative trend of @xmath10 versus the surface density of stars per pc@xmath21 , @xmath22 , adopting the high - resolution @xmath23 profile .",
    "indeed , for the majority of the clusters we identify a correlation , in some cases very significant ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "we also analyze these correlations considering all regions at once . in figures",
    "[ figure : adp_vs_radii ] and [ figure : adp_vs_density ] we present the dependence of @xmath10 respectively on @xmath20 and @xmath25 , using both our low- and high - resolution profiles , for both the assumptions of circular and elliptical apertures .",
    "as indicated by the @xmath19values , the correlations become more significant , due to the increased number statistics , in particular in the high resolution @xmath23 profiles .",
    "these trends become slightly weaker when elliptical symmetry is adopted ; this is because , as found in the onc in , this assumption naturally removes the first order of anisotropy in the stellar distribution , i.e. , the presence of an elongation in a particular direction .    in table [ table ] we also show for comparison the mst @xmath1 parameter , computed for each cluster within @xmath26 and @xmath9 . unlike for , where significant variations are measured within each cluster and among different clusters , all @xmath1 values cluster around 0.8 , the value generally assumed to discriminate between clumpy ( @xmath27 ) and centrally concentrated @xmath28 ) stellar distributions @xcite .",
    "this confirms that the @xmath1 parameter is adequate to separate highly substructured regions , where individual clumps are evident , but has little or no diagnostic power for probing more moderate degrees of substructure within centrally - concentrated clusters , where  is far more sensitive .",
    "increases with central concentration : @xmath29 for constant volume density @xmath30 within a sphere ; @xmath31 for @xmath32 also , interestingly , in most of our clusters @xmath1 tends to be slightly larger at @xmath9 than at @xmath26 , indicating an opposite trend at that we detect from .    considering the heterogeneity of the regions included in this analysis , both in terms of completeness (  [ section : analysis ] ) and because each region may differ in their physical and dynamical age , we also test these correlations normalizing each quantity on some characteristic value typical of each cluster .",
    "specifically , we consider @xmath33 , which is @xmath23 normalized on its average for each particular cluster ; also , the radius @xmath34 is @xmath35 and the surface density @xmath36 .",
    "the result is shown on the right - hand panels of figures [ figure : adp_vs_radii ] and [ figure : adp_vs_density ] .",
    "such normalizations always tighten the correlations , especially in the low - resolution case .",
    "we also tested if this improvement is particularly due to the normalization on one specific axis , considering all the combinations of such normalization .",
    "we found that for the @xmath37 trend , the normalization on @xmath38 is the dominant factor , indicating that the mystix clusters may have inherent differences in their overall degree of substructure . on the other hand , both normalizations in @xmath39",
    "contribute to the significance of the correlation between these quantities , probably due to the effect of inconsistent completeness affecting the densities we measure . from the linear fits of the high - density profiles , assuming circular symmetry , we measure : @xmath40 and @xmath41 , which are quantitative relations that can be compared to simulations of the dynamical evolution of young clusters .",
    "last , changing the numbers of sectors to 4 or 9 does not affect these trends . solely , as observed by , increasing the number of sectors tends to decrease @xmath23 , indicating that the substructure of young stellar clusters is dominated by anisotropy on larger angular scales .",
    "we also looked for trends of  with the median cluster age from @xcite , derived from the comparison of x - ray - derived stellar masses and extinction corrected @xmath42band magnitudes for a sample of sources in each region .",
    "we detected no significant correlation for any choice of  for each cluster .",
    "this may be due to the fact that the cluster ages differ by up to a factor of 3 - compared to a much larger range of @xmath43 ages as a function of distance from the center within each cluster - and are in general very uncertain ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these results are amongst the first to probe dynamical evolution during and shortly after star cluster formation , specifically the dissolution of substructure in embedded systems with membership based on x - ray emission . compared to other observational studies @xcite , which have been able to qualitatively detect systematic differences in the location of younger and older stars in young clusters , and their morphology as a function of age ,",
    "our results illustrate how  can be a metric of relative local dynamical age , which is greater in central , denser regions .    for gravitationally bound , virialized systems with virial parameter @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the 1d mass - averaged velocity dispersion",
    ", we can assess the dynamical age @xmath46 . here",
    "@xmath47 is the actual age of the system and @xmath48 is the local dynamical time .",
    "thus @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "the conversion between @xmath22 and @xmath51 depends on the mean stellar mass of the x - ray - detected sources , the degree of incompleteness of the stellar population and the contributions of gas . for a near complete stellar census and a similar mass of gas and stars",
    "we expect @xmath52 . with the exception of the onc ,",
    "most of the mystix clusters are expected to be more incomplete in their stellar census , due to their farther distances , and lower chandra exposure times in x - rays .",
    "as described in @xcite , however , the characterization of the completeness in each mystix region is challenging because the membership assignment from @xcite is quite restrictive and the completeness depends also on ir data and the reddening and crowding on each region .    still , using this conversion factor",
    "we may derive a lower limit on the dynamical age at @xmath53 , @xmath14 and @xmath9 .",
    "we have adopted the median age for each region from @xcite , which is available for all except four of our subclusters , which have been assigned a typical age of 2  myr .",
    "we have also adopted @xmath54 as a fiducial value .",
    "values @xmath55 then indicate this region of the cluster is older than a crossing time , and thus likely to be gravitationally bound and subject to dynamical smoothing of substructure . as reported in table [ table ] , all our clusters appear older than 1  @xmath56 at least in the core region ( @xmath13 ) , and in some cases up to @xmath14 .",
    "this conclusion is reinforced considering that our estimates of @xmath57 are lower limits due to incompleteness .",
    "figure [ figure : adp_vs_dynage ] shows the profiles of  as a function of @xmath57 ; we find that @xmath58 decreases with increasing dynamical age , and reaches values close to unity after a few dynamical times ( although values of @xmath57 here are likely lower limits ) . despite the uncertainties in @xmath59 and @xmath51 for each cluster , the correlation p - values in figure [ figure : adp_vs_dynage ]",
    "are always smaller than those derived for  as a function of @xmath20 and @xmath22 , indicating a tighter fit .",
    "as for the other parameters , table [ table ] also reports the best fit simple function correlation results for each individual cluster , showing a behavior similar to that of  versus @xmath22 .    measuring the degree of substructure was proposed as a way to assess whether star cluster formation was dynamically slow or rapid @xcite . we expect the quantitative dependence of @xmath60 is an important constraint against which to test theoretical models of star cluster formation .",
    "as we have shown ,  constitutes a much more sensitive estimator of substructure within centrally concentrated clusters or subclusters than the mst @xmath1 parameter , and advocate its use in both observational and theoretical studies of early cluster evolution .",
    "the absolute ages and age spreads of young star clusters are very difficult to measure and current estimates contain significant uncertainties .",
    "still , the results of future studies assessing such ages and age spreads of these star clusters systematically can be compared with our @xmath60 results to place the discovered structural evolution on an absolute timescale .",
