    "low mechanical loss materials are demanded in instruments with extraordinary precision to decrease their thermal noise as mechanical losses and thermal noise are linked @xcite . for instance , low loss materials like crystalline silicon , sapphire , calcium fluoride and quartz are candidates for the optical components of future cryogenic interferometric gravitational wave detectors @xcite . due to the anisotropy of the crystals and the search for an optimal operating temperature of the detectors systematic measurements of the mechanical losses",
    "have to be performed .",
    "therefore , our novel mechanical spectroscopy method , cryogenic resonant acoustic spectroscopy of bulk materials ( cra spectrocopy ) , was applied in the temperature range from 5 to 300  k. instead of the small losses in the detection band , the reciprocals of the losses at the resonant frequencies , the mechanical quality factors q , have been measured .",
    "following the test of our method on the fairly well - known material crystalline quartz @xcite , results on silicon and calcium fluoride are presented . for details on the measuring set - up and method see references @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the sample was of cylindrical shape , 76.2  mm in diameter and 12  mm thick .",
    "the reciprocals of the measured q factors , corresponding to the mechanical loss at the particular resonant frequency and temperature , of two selected modes have been plotted in fig.[fig : si]a ) and b ) .",
    "a )   b )     .fit parameters of the relaxation peaks in fig.[fig : si]a ) and b ) . the upper limit of the background damping is @xmath0 . [ cols=\"<,^,>,>,>,>,^ \" , ]     in the low temperature range the mechanical losses are dominated by thermoelastic damping ( black line in fig.[fig : caf2]b ) ) @xcite @xmath1 with the thermal conductivity @xmath2 , the volume thermal expansion coefficient @xmath3 , density @xmath4 and specific heat c. hence , the phonon - peak is less visible .",
    "the damping at higher temperatures offers an orientation for fitting . according to it ,",
    "the relaxation strength has been modelled to be proportional to t@xmath5 .",
    "an investigation of the losses below 5  k where the thermoelastic damping decreases would be helpfull for a better determination of the shape of the maximum .",
    "a further interpretation of the damping peaks according to their characteristic parameters is in progress .",
    "we thank f. bechstedt for the helpfull discussion as well as the german dfg for the support under contract sfb transregio 7 .",
