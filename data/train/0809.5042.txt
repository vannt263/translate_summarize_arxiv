    "gravitational fragmentation of massive , extended discs provides a way to form a large number of brown dwarfs per sun - like star ( stamatellos et al .",
    "we examine the consequences of this mechanism on the observed properties of brown dwarfs and compare them with observations .",
    "more specifically we perform an ensemble of 13 simulations with different numerical realisations of the same star and disc initial conditions , and for the objects produced we compute ( i ) their mass spectrum , ( ii ) their radial distribution from the primary star , ( iii ) their distribution of the orbital planes , ( iv ) the distribution of the masses and sizes of the brown dwarf discs , and ( v ) their binary properties .",
    "we consider a 0.7 m@xmath0 star with a 0.7 m@xmath0 disc that extends out to 400 au .",
    "the disc surface density drops as @xmath1 and the temperature drops as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the distance from the star on the disc midplane ( stamatellos & whitworth , 2008b ) .",
    "the simulations are performed in two phases .",
    "( i ) until @xmath4% of the disc has been accreted onto the stars ( this happens within 20,000 yr ) the evolution of the system is followed using sph , with a new method to capture the thermal and radiative effects when protostellar gas fragments ( stamatellos et al .",
    "the method uses a detailed equation of state for a gas mixture of hydrogen and helium.the effects of the rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom of h@xmath5 , of h@xmath5 dissociation , of h ionisation , and the first and second ionisation of he are included .",
    "moreover the opacity changes due to e.g. ice mantle melting , the sublimation of dust , molecular and h@xmath6 contributions , are also taken into account .",
    "the method also includes irradiation by the central star ( see stamatellos & whitworth 2008a , b ) .",
    "( ii ) afterwards the evolution of the system is followed up to 200,000 yr using an n - body code .",
    "the discs quickly ( within a few thousand years ) fragment ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sim ] ) forming gravitationally bound objects outside 50 au , where the conditions for fragmentation are right ( i.e. the disc is toomre unstable _ and _ can cool fast enough ) in accordance with our previous simulations and analytic studies ( whitworth & stamatellos 2006 ; stamatellos et al . 2007 ; stamatellos et al .",
    "2008a , b ) .",
    "a total of 96 objects are produced in all of our simulations .",
    "more than half of them are ejected into the field .",

    "the rest 25% of the objects produced are low - mass hydrogen - burning stars .",

    "objects that form closer to the primary star are generally the most massive ones formed in the disc as ( i ) they form first , and ( ii ) they form in a region where there is more material to accrete .",
    "hence , they become h - burning stars .",
    "brown dwarfs form farther out in the disc . due to dynamical interactions",
    "the low - mass h - burning stars move further in populating the region close to the primary star whereas the brown dwarfs move outwards ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : radius ] ) .",
    "hence the mechanism of disc fragmenation provides a natural explanation for the brown dwarf desert ( marcy & butler 2000 ) .",
    "our model predicts that the frequency of brown dwarf companions to sun - like stars is 8% within 100 au from the star and 16% within 400 au from the star .",

    "their orbital planes lie within @xmath7 from the disc mid - plane . however due to 3 body interactions , in 3-dimensions ,",
    "after 20,000 yr only 70% of the orbital planes lie within @xmath7 of the disc midplane , and by 200,000 yr this has dropped to 22% .",

    "we predict that for the binaries remaining bound to the central star , the total mass of the low - mass binary tends to decrease as the distance from the central star increases .",
    "most of the low - mass binaries ( 55% ) have components with similar masses ( q>0.7 ) .",
