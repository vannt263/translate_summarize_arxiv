    "synchronization is perhaps the most cross - disciplinary concept of emergence of collective behavior @xcite as it is manifested across many branches of natural and social sciences .",
    "ensembles of neurons , fireflies or humans are prone to synchronize their internal rhythms when they become coupled enough , producing a macroscopic dynamically coherent state . in all these seemingly unrelated situations ,",
    "no matter the precise nature of the coupled units , interaction drives system s components to behave homogeneously .",
    "thus , the study about the microscopic rules that drive ensembles towards synchrony has a long and fruitful history since the seminal observations made by christiaan huygens @xcite .    the mathematical formulation of the first models showing synchronization phenomena dates back to the @xmath0 s when , after some preliminary works by peskin and winfree @xcite , kuramoto @xcite formalized his celebrated model .",
    "the kuramoto model incorporates the minimum dynamical ingredients aimed at capturing a variety of physical phenomena related with the onset of synchronization .",
    "in particular , the kuramoto model links physical concepts such as self - organization , emergence , order in time and phase transitions , thus revealing as the most paradigmatic framework to study synchronization @xcite .        despite the large body of literature devoted to the kuramoto model and its variants ,",
    "its study has always been restricted to the classical domain . at first sight ,",
    "given the usual nature ( scale ) of the systems in which synchronization is typically observed , it seems superflous thinking of a quantum theory for the kuramoto model",
    ". however , there is not doubt about the fundamental importance of studying quantum fluctuations within the emergence of synchronized states @xcite .",
    "moreover , the kuramoto model has been implemented on circuits and micro and nanomechanical structures , systems which have already met the quantum domain @xcite . at the quantum level , synchronization , understood as the emergence of a coherent behaviour from an incoherent situation in the absence of external fields , is reminiscent of the phenomena such as condensation of bose - einsten and has been observed in interacting condensates of quasiparticles .",
    "additionally , synchronization has been suggested to occur in ensamble of atoms and enhance the coherence time next generation of lasers thus , moved by its fundamental and applied importance , in this work we provide the semiclassical version of the kuramoto model in an attempt for understanding the influence that quantumness has on the emergence of synchronized states .",
    "our work in this paper consists , as stated by caldeira and leggett @xcite , on finding consistent equations that in the classical limit matches the kuramoto model .",
    "our derivation relies on the quantization of open systems in the framework of feynman s path - integral formalism .",
    "we compute the first quantum corrections to the _ classical _ kuramoto model .",
    "we also analyze its critical properties by deriving the critical point from which synchronization shows up and determine how quantum fluctuations affect this synchronization transition .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section [ sec : classical ]",
    "we review the main features of the classical model .",
    "section [ sec : q - k ] , constitutes the main part of our work , there we present the semiclassical equations and draw our numerical results on the sync dynamics . in section [ sec :",
    "k ] we derive the critical value for the synchronization transition .",
    "we write our conclusions on [ sec : conc ] , sending most of the technical steps for the semiclassical calculations and the critical value to the appendices .",
    "the original kuramoto model @xcite considers a collection of @xmath1 phase - oscillators , _",
    "i.e. _ , it assumes that the characteristic time scale of their amplitudes is much faster than that for the phases .",
    "thus , the dynamical state of the @xmath2-th unit is described by an angular variable @xmath3 $ ] whose time evolution is given by : @xmath4 the above equation thus describes a set of weakly coupled phase - oscillators whose internal ( natural ) frequencies @xmath5 are , in principle , different as they are assigned following a frequency distribution @xmath6 that is assumed to be uni - modal and even around the mean frequency @xmath7 of the population , @xmath8 .    in the uncoupled limit ( @xmath9 )",
    "each element @xmath2 describes limit - cycle oscillations with characteristic frequency @xmath10 .",
    "kuramoto showed that , by increasing the coupling @xmath11 the system experiences a transition towards complete synchronization , _ i.e. _ , a dynamical state in which @xmath12 @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "this transition shows up when the coupling strength exceeds a critical value whose exact value is : @xmath15    to monitor the transition towards synchronization , kuramoto introduce a complex order parameter : @xmath16 the modulus of the above order parameter , @xmath17 $ ] , measures the coherence of the collective motion , reaching the value @xmath18 when the system is fully synchronized , while @xmath19 for the incoherent solution . on the other hand , the value of @xmath20 accounts for the average phase of the collective dynamics of the system .    in figure [ fig:1 ]",
    "we have illustrated the synchronization in the kuramoto model .",
    "the panels in the top show , for different values of the coupling @xmath11 , how the oscillators concentrate as @xmath11 increases .",
    "below we have shown the usual synchronization diagram @xmath21 for which the exact value of @xmath22 for each @xmath11 is the result of a time average of @xmath23 over a large enough time window . in this diagram",
    "we can observe that @xmath24 as a result of using the distribution @xmath6 shown in the right .",
    "let us note that the all - to - all coupling considered originally by kuramoto can be trivially generalized to any connectivity structure by introducing the coupling matrix @xmath25 inside the sum in eq .",
    "( [ k0 ] ) so that each term @xmath26 accounting for the interaction between oscillator @xmath2 and @xmath26 is assigned a different weight .",
    "the latter allows for the study of the synchronization properties of a variety of real - world systems for which interactions between constituents are better described as a complex network @xcite .",
    "the formalism developed in this work is fully general and valid for any form of @xmath27 thus making possible the extension of the large number of studies about the kuramoto model in any topology @xcite to the semiclassical domain .",
    "however , the numerical part of our work will deal with the all - to - all coupling for the sake of comparison with the original kuramoto work .",
    "the most important problem when facing the quantization of the kuramoto model is its non - hamiltonian character since , as introduced above , equation ( [ k0 ] ) assumes the steady - state for the dynamical state of the amplitude of the oscillators .",
    "thus , a question arises , how do we introduce quantum fluctuations in the kuramoto model ?",
    "one possible choice is to resort to the original microscopic dynamics of amplitude and phases and then identify the underlying hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "however , many different dynamical setups can have the kuramoto model as their corresponding limiting case of fast amplitude dynamics .",
    "thus , in order to keep the flavor of generality of the kuramoto model , it is desirable not to resort to any specific situation ( hamiltonian ) and introduce quantum fluctuations directly .",
    "a similar problem was faced by caldeira and leggett in the eighties @xcite when they studied the influence of dissipation in quantum tunneling . in their case ,",
    "the corresponding classical dynamics dates back to the studies on activation theory by kramers @xcite .",
    "classically , a particle in a potential experience an energy barrier to surmount , that is typically acquired from thermal fluctuations . on the other hand , a quantum particle finds in tunnelling an alternative way to bypass an energy barrier .",
    "caldeira and leggett were thus interested in quantifying the catalytic effect of tunnelling in ( effectively ) lowering the energy barriers .",
    "however , as in the kuramoto model , kramers activation theory is based in langevin equations , _",
    "i.e. _ stochastic equations that are not directly obtained from any lagrangian . furthermore , most of reaction rate equations were phenomenological . therefore , they searched for a consistent way for introducing quantum fluctuations regardless of the microscopic origin of the _ effective _ classical evolution . as a byproduct their work opened the field of quantum brownian motion in the most general way",
    "we take here the same route followed by caldeira and leggett to introduce quantum fluctuations in the kuramoto model . in order to accomodate our dynamical system ( [ k0 ] ) to the framework provided in @xcite",
    "we start by writting its corresponding langevin equation : @xmath28 with @xmath29 as usual , @xmath30 is a markovian stochastic fluctuating force with @xmath31 and @xmath32 . in the limit",
    "@xmath33 , equation ( [ langevin ] ) reduces to the kuramoto model in equation ( [ k0 ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ langevin ] ) is nothing but a langevin equation in the overdamped limit .",
    "it is first rather than second order in time as the inertia term is neglected .",
    "consequently , the kuramoto model can be viewed as a set of phases evolving in the overdamped limit .",
    "the absence of fluctuations in the limit @xmath34 means that the system of phases is at zero temperature , @xmath35 .",
    "such identification with a langevin equation has been already used for generalizations of the original kuramoto model taking into account noise and/or inertial effects @xcite . in particular , in @xcite it is shown that the critical value @xmath36 reads : @xmath37 which , in the limit @xmath34 , recovers the kuramoto critical coupling ( [ crit - clas ] ) .",
    "the key point of deriving the langevin equation ( [ langevin ] ) corresponding to the kuramoto model is that it can be obtained from a fully hamiltonian framework by coupling the system , in our case the coupled phases @xmath38 , to a macroscopic bath or reservoir @xcite . in this way , both the damping and fluctuations are seen to be caused by the coupling of the system of phases to the bath .",
    "the hamiltonian description is properly casted in the system - bath approach : @xmath39 where the bath is an infinite collection of harmonic oscillators with frequencies @xmath40 ( note that greek subindexes will denote the oscillators in the bath ) . in the case we are dealing with",
    "the _ total _",
    "hamiltonian reads : @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 denote the system and bath canonical coordinates , respectively , while @xmath44 stands for the coupling constant between bath and system coordinates .    under well defined conditions , the equations of motion for the system coordinates derived from the hamiltonian ( [ k - ht ] ) lead to the the afore - derived overdamped langevin equation ( [ langevin ] ) .",
    "in particular , one needs to assume : _ ( i ) _ thermalized initial conditions for the bath : @xmath45 _ ( ii ) _ the frequency spectrum of the bath oscillators is flat ( this assumption leads to the widely used ohmic dissipation ) , and finally _",
    "( iii ) _ the changes in time of the velocity ( acceleration ) induced by the energy potentials are far slower than the energy loss induced by the coupling between the system and the bath ( this is the situation when the system and the bath are strongly coupled ) so that we could neglect the inertial term .",
    "once we have a hamiltonian description for the kuramoto equation ( [ k0 ] ) , we are ready to perform its quantization .",
    "first , we associate the phases and their associated momenta together with the positions and momenta for the bath by providing them with the canonical commutation rules .",
    "the hardest work is to find an effective quantum evolution depending only on phase operators , _",
    "i.e. _ the so - called quantum langevin equation .",
    "it turns out that such operators equation is a non - local in time differential equation , which makes it extremely difficult to manipulate in general .",
    "however , the quantum version of equation ( [ langevin ] ) in the overdamped limit is a @xmath46-number local differential equation @xcite .",
    "the full derivation for the quantum langevin equation is based on the path integral formulation .",
    "it is lengthy and rather technical .",
    "let us first present the final result ( below ) , then a sketch of the deriviation .",
    "further details can be found in appendix [ app : q - k ] .",
    "the resulting quantum evolution in the ito representation reads as follows : @xmath47 where we have used the compact notation @xmath48 , @xmath30 is an stochastic force with the same statistics as in ( [ langevin ] ) , @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the _ quantumness _ parameter : @xmath51 -\\mathrm{c } + \\frac{2 \\pi}{\\hbar \\beta \\gamma } \\right ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] being @xmath52 the euler - mascheroni constant and @xmath53 the digamma function .",
    "note that in the limit @xmath54 @xmath55 .",
    "making @xmath55 the quantum langevin reduces to the classical .",
    "this is a remarkable property .",
    "our result is perturbative in @xmath56 , giving the first quantum corrections containing , as a limit , the kuramoto model .",
    "we notice that , being perturbative , @xmath57 must be _ small _ , wich means that our equation is valid at high temperatures and damping . as a drawback of the perturbative character ,",
    "the model can not be pushed to the zero temperature limit . compared to its classical counterpart [ @xmath58 , eq .",
    "( [ langevin ] ) ] , eq .",
    "( [ q - l ] ) has a renormalized effective potential ( [ eff - pot ] ) ( third term in the r.h.s ) .",
    "besides , both the diffusion and consequently its noise terms are also modified by the quantum fluctuations ( second and last terms in the r.h.s respectively ) .",
    "the noise , because of the @xmath59 is now multiplicative . in the limit @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "hence , in the classical limit the multiplicative noise switches into additive noise .",
    "this immediately suggests that the multiplicative nature is related to the underlying quantum stochastic process .",
    "quantum noise depends , undoubtedly , on the state of the system , the dynamics of observables depend on the state the system is and therefore , quantum noise in a langevin equation must depend upon the dynamics of the system itself .",
    "this explains the multiplicative character of the noise in eq .   at the single variable level .",
    "this result is consistent with previous works along this line ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "any langevin equation , classical or quantum , is an effective evolution for the system of interest degrees of freedom .",
    "if we start with the total hamiltonian , the bath degrees of freedom need to be integrated out . in the quantum regime",
    ", this means taking the partial trace over the bath hilbert space .",
    "we follow here the program explained in refs .",
    "the steps are as follows . _",
    "i ) _ the equilibrium reduced density matrix @xcite : @xmath62 is obtained in the overdamped limit .",
    "both @xmath63 and @xmath64 are a shorthand notation for denote the bath ( @xmath65 ) and system ( @xmath66 ) coordinates .",
    "in such a regime the damping is sufficiently strong to suppress the non - diagonal elements , _ coherences _ , of the reduced density matrix , i.e. , a regime where @xmath67 .",
    "we define @xmath68 as detailed in appendix [ app : q - k ] , the reduced density matrix in the overdamped limit can be written as : @xmath69    once the equilibrium density matrix is obtained , _ ii ) _ the master equation for the probability distribution @xmath70 [ cf .",
    "is proposed .",
    "taking into account the results for the harmonic oscillator @xcite and the single particle case @xcite , the master equation can be formally written as : @xmath71 the _ iii ) _ actual master equation takes a fokker planck form .",
    "it is by obtained imposing that the equilibrium density distribution @xmath72 given by eq .   is stationary under ,",
    "the final result is @xmath74    \\\\ & + \\frac{{\\partial}}{{\\partial}{\\theta}_i}\\left [   \\frac{d}{\\gamma^2f_i}\\right ] \\big\\rbrace p.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] finally , _",
    "iv ) _ the langevin equation is obtained via the equivalence of fokker - planck equations , as eq .   and langevin - type equations @xcite .",
    "for the classical ( @xmath75 ) and the quantum ( @xmath76 ) kuramoto models . in both cases the thermal noise is chosen such that @xmath77 .",
    "the number of oscillators is @xmath78 and the distribution of natural frequencies is given in eq .",
    "( [ equ : lorentzian ] ) centered in @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "it is clear that the synchronization onset is delayed as soon as quantumness enters into play . in panels ( b ) and",
    "( c ) we show the probability @xmath81 of finding an oscillator at a given phase @xmath82 as a function of @xmath11 .",
    "note that for each value of @xmath11 , the phases has been equally shifted so that the mean phase is located at @xmath83 .",
    "a thick grey line indicates the critical values @xmath36 and @xmath84 for classical and quantum dynamics , respectively . ]",
    "once we derived the semiclassical version of the kuramoto equation , it is natural to unveil the effects that quantum fluctuations induce in the transition to synchronization .",
    "as introduced previously , to study the synchronization transition one resorts to the order parameter @xmath22 [ introduced in equation ( [ q - l ] ) ] that reveals the synchronized state of the system .",
    "we solve both the classical kuramoto model ( @xmath85 ) and the quantum one ( @xmath86 ) numerically , extracting from the dynamics the stationary value of @xmath22 . through this work ,",
    "the numerical calculations are performed with @xmath78 oscillators and the distribution of natural frequencies is lorentzian : @xmath87 with @xmath80 and centered around @xmath79 .",
    "figure [ fig:2].a shows the typical synchronization diagram , namely , the value of @xmath22 as a function of the coupling strength @xmath11 .",
    "the comparison of the semiclassical ( for @xmath76 ) and classical curves @xmath88 evinces that quantum fluctuations delay the onset of synchronization , _ i.e. _ , the critical point @xmath36 is seen to move to larger values with @xmath50 .",
    "we have also considered the evolution for the distribution of the phases as a function of @xmath11 to monitor the microscopic fingerprint of the synchronization transition .",
    "the evolution of the classical and quantum kuramoto models is shown in figures [ fig:2].b and [ fig:2].c , respectively .    to explain the delay in the synchronization onset introduced by quantum fluctuations we resort to the simplest situation : two coupled kuramoto oscillators . in this case the kuramoto model ( [ langevin ] ) consists of just two coupled equations for the evolution of @xmath89 and @xmath90 . by taking the difference of those two equations and introducing as a new variable the phase difference , @xmath91",
    ", we obtain for its evolution the following equation : @xmath92 the latter equation describes the evolution of an overdamped particle in a washboard potential ( see figure [ fig : mechanical ] ) . with this image in mind , we map the synchronous movement of the two oscillators ( defined as a state in which the frequencies of the oscillators are locked : @xmath93 ) with the resting state of the overdamped particle inside a local minimum of the potential energy ( @xmath94 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "when the two oscillators are not synchronized the particle drifts across the potential ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "both situations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mechanical ] .",
    "the quantum version for the diffusion of an overdamped particle in a periodic potential has been previously studied in ref .",
    "the main result is that the scape rate of the particle , and thus its unlocking mechanism , is enhanced through quantum fluctuations .",
    "this effect can be seen as a consequence of the enhancement of the transition probability for energies below the height of the barrier which is nothing but the well - known tunnel effect @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mechanical ] we show , for both the classical and semiclassical ( @xmath76 ) systems of two coupled kuramoto oscillators , the value of @xmath94 as a function of the ratio between the difference of the natural frequencies of the two oscillators @xmath96 and the coupling @xmath11 .",
    "it is clear that , as stated above , quantum tunnelling facilitates the drift or , equivalently , delays the transition to the synchronous state .",
    "coming back to the original model of @xmath1 interacting oscillators , we now make an analytical estimation of the value for critical coupling at which the synchronization transition occurs .",
    "the procedure is a generalization of the one presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and takes advantage of the mean field description of the kuramoto model .",
    "the derivation ( detailed in appendix [ app : kc ] ) yields a rather simple equation for the critical coupling : @xmath97 being @xmath36 the classical critical value shown in eq .",
    "( [ kcs ] ) .    the above result states that quantum fluctuations act by effectively decreasing the coupling strength with the degree of quantumness @xmath50 . coming back to the physical image of a particle in a washboard potential",
    ", we can consider the effect of the quantum correction by considering the first and third terms in the right hand side of equation ( [ q - l ] ) . in this way",
    ", quantum corrections can be casted in the form of an effective potential : @xmath98 that in the particular case of the washboard potential reads : @xmath99 the above equation makes clear that tunnelling is formally reflected by an effective barrier reduction that yields the observed shift to higher values for the critical coupling .",
    "our analytical estimation for @xmath100 is plotted in figure [ fig:2 ] and [ fig:4 ] ( vertical arrows ) confirming its validity . to corroborate further the correctness of equation ( [ kqkcl ] )",
    ", we explore the synchronization transition for different values of @xmath50 in figure [ fig:4].a . as expected the onset of synchronization shifts to higher values as the degree of quantumness increases .",
    "again , the predicted value for @xmath101 is plotted ( vertical arrows ) corroborating the validity of equation ( [ kqkcl ] ) .    to complete our study",
    ", we show in [ fig:4].b the dependence of the synchronization diagram with the _ thermal fluctuations _ , @xmath102 , both for the classical and quantum ( @xmath76 ) cases .",
    "in all the curves explored the coupling @xmath11 is rescaled by the corresponding critical coupling @xmath36 in the classical regime . in this way",
    "we show both for the classical and quantum cases , the robustness of the critical value ( [ kqkcl ] ) against temperature changes .",
    "the search for quantum corrections to classical phenomena has been pervasive in physics .",
    "some examples related to our work are the generalization to the quantum domain of chaos @xcite , dissipation @xcite , random walks @xcite , etc .",
    "each of these examples finds its own difficulties when incorporating quantum fluctuations and unveiling their role .",
    "some of these obstacles are the quantum linearity versus the typical non - linearity of classical systems and the quantization of non - hamiltonian system or phenomenological equations .",
    "overcoming these obstacles provides with a consistent quantum description that opens the quantum door to a variety of classical problems and their associated physical phenomena .    among the most studied phenomena in ( classical ) complex systems",
    "is synchronization .",
    "this emergent phenomena is as intriguing as beautiful , since it covers from the description of the _ sympathy _ of clocks to the neuronal functioning in our brain , thus overcoming the disparately diversity in the spatial and time scales associated to the bunch of systems in which synchronization is observed .",
    "however , the concept of synchronization was usually associated to the classical domain as the typical examples of clocks , fireflies or humans are too macroscopic to think about the need of introducing quantum fluctuations in the description of the associated dynamical models .",
    "recently , some experimental works have shown that synchronization can be observed in the lab within josepshon junction arrays @xcite , nanomechanical @xcite or optomechanical systems @xcite .",
    "all of these systems share one prominent property : they behave quantum mechanically at sufficiently low temperatures . therefore ,",
    "adapting the concept of synchronization among coupled entities within the quantum theory is , apart from an interesting theoretical issue , a must imposed by the rapid experimental advances .",
    "a first step consists in taking the most widely used framework for studying synchronization phenomena , the kuramoto model , and adapting it to the quatum domain .",
    "being a paradigmatic theoretical setup , the quantization of the kuramoto model opens the door to the theoretical study of quantum synchronization in the widest possible manner . to this end , and to overcome the non - hamiltonian character of the kuramoto equations , we have mapped the model to an overdamped langevin equation which has a hamiltonian description by embedding the system in a bath of oscillators . in this way ,",
    "the quantization of the kuramoto model is straightforward and it includes its classical counterpart as a limiting case : the quantum version incorporates quantum fluctuations for the phases while the strength of these quantum corrections are encoded in a single parameter .",
    "the route chosen here must be understood as complementary to the study of particular models of coupled quantum systems .",
    "the reason is twofold .",
    "first , we aim to be as general as possible .",
    "the essence of an emergent phenomena is its ability of describe very different situations with different microscopic dynamics .",
    "this is the goal of the kuramoto model , as it explains the synchronization without resorting to the specific dynamics .",
    "second , a force brute study of many body quantum entities is a very difficult task that usually implies the reduction of the system to a few coupled systems .",
    "however , the observation of a true synchronization transition demands hundreds or thousands of interacting dynamical systems .",
    "being general , the results obtained allow to make general statements about the impact that quantumness has on the synchronization of coupled dynamical units .",
    "the most important one is that quantum fluctuations delay the appearance of a synchronized state .",
    "the explanation of this effect relies on the fact that in the quantum domain the phases not only have a different natural frequency but also the fluctuations around the classical trajectories are different depending on those internal rhythms . to illustrate this interpretation we recall the simple case of two coupled kuramoto oscillators . in this case",
    "quantum fluctuations are nothing but thermal assisted tunneling favoring the phase unlocking .",
    "therefore , the coupling needed to synchronize the two oscillators is higher in the quantum limit .",
    "finally , we want to point out that in a recent publication the question about synchronization in quantum evolutions was also discussed @xcite . under rather general conditions",
    "they find bounds for the degree of synchronization based on the heisenberg uncertainty principle : the phases , derived as averages of non - conmuting operators , can not take values infinitely close . instead , in our case ,",
    "focused on the quantum version of the kuramoto model , we have discussed , not the maximum degree of synchronization but the critical onset for the appearance of partially synchronized states . in this case",
    "quantumness also limits the emergence of a synchronous state .",
    "therefore , pretty much like in what happens in quantum chaos , synchronization seems to be a quasi - classical phenomena @xcite .",

    "the overdamped dynamics refer to a regime in the parameter space where damping is sufficiently strong to suppress the non - diagonal elements , _ coherences _ , of the reduced density matrix , i.e. , a regime where @xmath67 .",

    "let us denote the minimal action ( ma ) path as @xmath112 .",
