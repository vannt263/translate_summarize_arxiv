    "electromagnetic structures can be modeled through computer - aided design ( cad ) tools in conjunction with programs for numerically solving maxwell s equations .",
    "though alternatives abound @xcite , the latter often use the finite - element method ( fem ) @xcite .",
    "within such a scheme , a problem frequently encountered when attempting to determine the values of electromagnetic parameters from experimental data is a lack of _ traceability _ : significant dependencies between the data , the model s configurational settings , and the inferred values of parameters can not be adequately isolated , understood , or quantified .",
    "traceability demands that both the model s definition and its solution remain amenable to complete , explicit description . and",
    ", furthermore , convenience requires that the representations adopted for this purpose be concise yet wholly unambiguous .",
    "certain compact electromagnetic structures support closed whispering - gallery ( wg ) modes . though elliptical @xcite or even non - planar ( ` crinkled ' @xcite or ` spooled ' @xcite )",
    "wg morphologies exhibit advantageous features with respect to certain applications , this paper considers only ( closed , planar ) wg modes with circular trajectories , as supported by axisymmetric resonators within the class depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : generic_resonator ] , upon which various recent scientific innovations @xcite are based .    .",
    "this domain comprises several subdomains ( d1 , d2 , and d3 ) , each containing a spatially uniform dielectric ( that could be just free space ) .",
    "some of these subdomains ( d2 and d3 ) are bounded internally by electric walls ( e2 , e2@xmath0 and e3 ) .",
    "the resonator has ( optionally ) a mirror symmetry through its ( horizontal ) equatorial plane ( dashed line m1 ) ; on imposing an electric or magnetic wall over this plane , only either the upper or lower half of the resonator need be simulated . ]",
    "many of the current commercial software packages for modeling electromagnetic resonators suffer , however , from a ` blind spot ' when it comes to calculating , efficiently ( hence accurately ) , such resonators whispering - gallery modes .",
    "the popular mafia / cst package @xcite is a case in point : as basu _",
    "et al _ @xcite and no doubt others have experienced , it can not be configured to take advantage of a circular wg mode s known azimuthal dependence , _ viz .",
    "_  @xmath1 , where @xmath2 ( an integer @xmath3 ) is the mode s azimuthal mode order , and @xmath4 the azimuthal coordinate .",
    "though frequencies and field patterns can be obtained ( at least for wg modes of low azimuthal mode order ) , the computationally advantageous reduction of the problem from 3d to 2d that the resonator s rotational symmetry affords is , consequently , precluded wide ] between radial electric and magnetic walls . ] ; and the ability to simulate high - order wg modes with sufficient accuracy ( for metrological purposes ) is , exasperatingly , lost .",
    "the method of ` separating the variables ' provides analytical expressions for the wg modes of right - cylindrical uniform dielectric cavities ( or shells ) @xcite . by matching expressions across certain boundaries , approximate",
    "wg - mode solutions for composite cylindrical cavities can be obtained @xcite ,",
    "whose discrete / integer indices ( related to symmetries ) provide a nomenclature @xcite for classifying the lower - order wg modes of all similar structures . extensions of the basic mode - matching method encompassing spatially non - uniform field polarizations have been developed @xcite .",
    "the accurate solution of arbitrarily shaped axisymmetrical dielectric resonators requires numerical methods . apart from the finite - element method ( fem ) itself ,",
    "the most developed and ( thus ) immediately exploitable alternatives include ( given here only for reference not considered in any greater detail ) : ( i ) the ritz - rayleigh variational or ` moment ' methods @xcite , ( ii ) the finite difference time domain method ( fdtd ) @xcite , and ( iii ) the boundary - integral @xcite or boundary - element methods ( bem , including fem - based hybridizations thereof @xcite ) .",
    "zienkiewicz and taylor @xcite , particularly their table 3.2 , indicate various commonalities between them ( and fem ) .",
    "the application of the finite - element method to the solving of maxwell s equations has a history @xcite , and is now an industry @xcite ; ref .",
    "@xcite supplies fem s theoretical underpinnings .",
    "though the method can solve for all three of a wg mode s field components , the statement of maxwell s ( coupled partial - differential ) equations in component form can be onerous , if not excluded outright by the equation - solving software s lack of configurability . with circular whispering - gallery modes ,",
    "the configurational effort can be significantly reduced by invoking a so - called ` transverse ' approximation @xcite , wherein only a single ( scalar ) partial - differential equation is solved ( in 2d ) . here , either the magnetic or electric field is assumed to lie everywhere parallel to the resonator s axis of rotational symmetry ( see figure b.1 of ref .",
    "this approximation is , however , uncontrolled .",
    "this paper demonstrates that , through only a modicum of extra configurational effort , the transverse approximation and its associated doubts can be wholly obviated .",
    "a problem that besets the direct application of fem to the solving of maxwell s equations is the generation of ( many ) spurious solutions @xcite , associated with the local gauge invariance , or ` null space ' @xcite , that is a feature of the equations ` curl ' operators .",
    "at least two research groups have nevertheless developed in - house software tools for calculating the wg modes of axisymmetric dielectric resonators , that : ( i )  solve for all field components ( _ i.e. _  no transverse approximation is invoked ) , ( ii )  are 2d ( and thus numerically efficient ) and ( iii ) effectively suppress spurious solutions ( without detrimental side - effects ) @xcite .",
    "the method described in this paper sports these same three attributes . with regard to ( iii ) ,  the approach adopted by auborg _",
    "et al _ was to use different finite elements ( _ viz .",
    "_ a mixture of ` nedelec ' and ` lagrange ' -both 2nd order ) for different components of the electric and magnetic fields ; osegueda _ et al _ @xcite , on the other hand , used a so - called ` penalty term ' to suppress ( spurious ) divergence of the magnetic field . stripping away its motivating remarks , applications and illustrations , this paper , in essence ,",
    "translates the latter approach into explicit _ ` weak - form ' _ expressions , that can be directly and openly ported to any partial - differential equation ( pde ) solver ( most notably comsol / femlab @xcite ) capable of accepting such .",

    "reference  @xcite ( particular section 1.3 thereof ) supplies a primer on the electromagnetic boundary conditions stated here . the magnetic flux density at any point on a ( perfect ) electric wall satisfies @xmath18 , where @xmath19 denotes the wall s surface normal vector .",
    "providing the magnetic susceptibility of the dielectric medium bounded by the electric wall is not anisotropic , this condition is equivalent to @xmath20 the electric field strength at the electric wall obeys @xmath21 these two equations ensure that the magnetic(electric ) field strength is oriented tangential(normal ) to the electric wall .",

  "abstract_text": [
    "<S> this paper explains how a popular , commercially - available software package for solving partial - differential - equations ( pdes ) , as based on the finite - element method ( fem ) , can be configured to calculate , efficiently , the frequencies and fields of the whispering - gallery ( wg ) modes of axisymmetric dielectric resonators . </S>",
    "<S> the approach is traceable ; it exploits the pde - solver s ability to accept the definition of solutions to maxwell s equations in so - called ` _ _ weak form _ _ ' . </S>",
    "<S> associated expressions and methods for estimating a wg mode s volume , filling factor(s ) and , in the case of closed(open ) resonators , its wall(radiation ) loss , are provided . as no transverse approximation </S>",
    "<S> is imposed , the approach remains accurate even for _ quasi_-transverse - magnetic / electric modes of low , finite azimuthal mode order . </S>",
    "<S> the approach s generality and utility are demonstrated by modeling several non - trivial structures : ( i )  two different optical microcavities [ one toroidal made of silica , the other an algaas microdisk ] ; ( ii ) a 3rd - order sapphire : air bragg cavity ; ( iii ) two different cryogenic sapphire wg - mode resonators ; both ( ii ) and ( iii ) operate in the microwave x - band . by fitting one of ( iii ) to a set of measured resonance frequencies , the dielectric constants of sapphire at liquid - helium temperature have been estimated . </S>"
