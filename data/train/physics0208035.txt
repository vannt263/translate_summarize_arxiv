    "magnetoimpedance ( mi ) consists of a change of total impedance of a magnetic conductor ( usually ferromagnetic ) under application of a static magnetic field @xmath0 .",
    "when an ac current , @xmath1 of magnitude @xmath2 and angular frequency @xmath3 (= @xmath4 , with @xmath5 the ordinary frequency ) flows through the material , it generates , by ampre s law , a transverse magnetic field inducing some magnetization . at low frequency , the change in the transverse magnetization generates an additional inductive voltage @xmath6 across the conductor : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the resistance .",
    "hence mi can be written as @xmath9 , where the imaginary part is given by the ratio of magnetic flux to ac current and mi field dependence is related to the transverse permeability .",
    "when frequency increases the current gets distributed near the surface of the conductor , changing both resistive and inductive components of the total voltage @xmath10 .",
    "the field dependence of mi is dictated by skin depth @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the velocity of light , @xmath13 the conductivity and @xmath14 the permeability ( for non magnetic ordinary metals , @xmath15 ) .",
    "the current distribution is governed not only by the shape of the conductor and frequency but also the transverse magnetization depending on @xmath0 .",
    "+ typically mi increases with frequency , attains a maximum at frequencies for which the skin effect is strong ( @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a characteristic length scale such as the wire radius or ribbon / film thickness ) and then decreases since permeability becomes insensitive to the field at high enough frequency .",
    "+ mi effect is ordinarily weak and did not attract much attention in the past .",
    "interest in mi was triggered in the early 90 s when panina et al .",
    "@xcite and beach et al .",
    "@xcite reported a very large ( giant ) mi effect in amorphous ferromagnetic fecosib wires with small magnetic fields and at relatively low frequencies ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this shows that a large variation of the mi is observable in a finite frequency range for reasons that will be explained in later sections .",
    "later on , machado et al .",
    "@xcite observed a smaller effect in fe@xmath18co@xmath19si@xmath20b@xmath20 thin films and beach et al .",
    "@xcite in ribbons .",
    "+ the dramatic variation of the mi ( that can reach in some cases values larger than 800% ) with small magnetic fields ( a few oersteds ) and at relatively low frequencies ( tens of mhz ) in widely available materials is the origin of the interest in the giant magnetoimpedance ( gmi ) effect .",
    "+ gmi materials share the property of being magnetically soft ( easy to magnetize ) and are now available as wires ( typical diameter of the order of a mm ) , microwires ( typical diameter of the order of a micron ) , ribbons , magnetically coated metallic ( usually nonmagnetic ) wires ( tubes ) , thin films and multilayers , albeit , the effect itself occurs with widely differing magnitude depending on the geometry , the constituent materials and their layering . +",
    "in order to clearly identify gmi , several observations should be made :    1 .",
    "a very large change ( of the order of at least 100% variation ) of the impedance should occur with an external dc magnetic field @xmath0 .",
    "the change expressed in % is defined by the largest value of the ratio : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the impedance measured in the presence of the dc magnetic field @xmath0 and @xmath23 is the impedance measured at the saturation limit when the magnetization does not change any longer with the applied field .",
    "2 .   the external dc magnetic field @xmath0 should be on the order of a few oersteds only ( see table i on magnetic units and quantities ) .",
    "the frequency range is on the order of mhz or tens of mhz ( excluding any effect based on ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr ) where the frequencies are typically in the ghz range @xcite ) . in many materials",
    "this means that the skin depth @xmath24 ( typically microns at these frequencies ) is larger than the thickness of the material ( typically a fraction of a micron ) .",
    "when the frequency is in the ghz , @xmath24 is generally very small with respect to the thickness .",
    "it should be stressed that in ordinary metals , the skin depth does not depend on permeability , whereas in magnetic materials , the behavior of the permeability on geometry ( see for instance section iv ) , temperature , stress , composition and so on , is reflected in the skin depth . in addition , permeability might be changed by post - processing the material after growth with annealing under presence or absence of magnetic field or mechanical stress ...",
    "gmi is a _ classical phenomenon _ that can be explained thoroughly on the basis of usual electromagnetic concepts @xcite in sharp contrast with giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) effect where resistance is changed by a magnetic field .",
    "gmr requires quantum mechanical concepts based on the spin of the carriers and their interactions with the magnetization of the magnetic material .",
    "several general conditions must be satisfied by any material in order to show a gmi .    1",
    ".   the material should be magnetically soft .",
    "that is , it should be easily magnetised or in other words must have a relatively narrow hysteresis curve implying , in general , small losses in the course of the magnetization cycle .",
    "2 .   the material should have a well defined anisotropy axis .",
    "that means there must be a direction along which the magnetization of the material lies on the average ( easy axis ) .",
    "however the value of the anisotropy field @xmath25 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) should be relatively small ( on the order of a few oersteds )",
    ". the typical ratio of @xmath25 to @xmath26 must be about 20 .",
    "that insures observation of large magnetoimpedance effects , typically .",
    "3 .   the coercive field @xmath26 must be small ( fraction of an oersted ) and the hysteresis loop thin and narrow . since @xmath26 and the shape of the hysteresis loop change ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) with the angle the magnetic field makes with the easy axis ( or anisotropy axis ) of the material , these are taken at the reference point when the field is along the easy axis .",
    "the ac current @xmath1 , injected in the material , should be perpendicular to the easy axis ( or anisotropy direction ) and the magnetic field it creates @xmath27 should be small with respect to @xmath25 ( see table i on magnetic units and quantities ) .",
    "the material must have a small resistivity ( @xmath28.cm ) since it carries the ac current .",
    "this is important , since many magnetic materials have large resistivities .",
    "amorphous metals are interesting in that respect since , typically , their resistivities at room temperature are in the 100 @xmath29.cm range .",
    "the material should have a large saturation magnetization @xmath30 in order to boost the interaction with the external magnetic field .",
    "above arguments are equivalent to a very large permeability at zero frequency ( the ratio @xmath31 gives a rough indication for this value ) .",
    "this means several 1000 s ( see table ii ) .",
    "the material should have a small magnetostriction ( ms ) .",
    "this means , mechanical effects caused by application of a magnetic field should be small .",
    "mechanical stress due to ms alters the soft properties of the material by acting as an effective anisotropy .",
    "this alters the direction of the anisotropy , displacing it from the transverse case and thereby reducing the value of the mi .",
    "typical case materials are displayed along with their ms coefficient in table ii .",
    "the general theory of the mi effect is widely available in classic textbooks @xcite ( for a long cylinder ) and it has been shown experimentally that a large mi often occurs at frequencies of a few mhz . changing the dc biasing field @xmath0 , the maximum @xmath32 can be as large as a few times the value of @xmath33 the dc resistance . at low frequency @xmath32",
    "has a peak around @xmath34 and as the frequency increases , the peak moves toward @xmath35 where @xmath25 is the anisotropy field .",
    "therefore , @xmath32 as a function of @xmath0 possesses a single or a double peak as the frequency increases ( fig .  [ fig3 ] ) . when the direction of the anisotropy field is well defined the peaks are sharp",
    ". + the behavior of @xmath32 versus @xmath0 follows very closely the behavior of the real part of the transverse permeability versus @xmath0 as we will show in later sections on wires and ribbons .",
    "therfore it is very important to develop an understanding for the processes controlling the permeability . + material permeability depends on sample geometry , nature of exciting field , temperature , frequency , stress distribution in the material as well as internal configuration of the magnetization that might be altered by processing or frequency . for instance",
    ", some materials should be annealed under the presence of a magnetic field or a mechanical stress in order to favor some direction for the magnetization or to release the stress contained in them .",
    "+ regarding frequency , when it is large enough ( @xmath36 1mhz is sufficient in many materials ) domain wall displacements ( dwd ) are considerably reduced by eddy - currents and therefore magnetization varies by rotation or switching as if in a single domain ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) . as a consequence , the rotational motion of the magnetization controls the behaviour of the permeability , through the skin depth . + considering @xmath17 as a typical thickness ( in the case of films / ribbons ) or radius ( in the case of wires or microwires ) , frequencies in the tens of mhz , lead to @xmath37 for the observation of gmi .",
    "this condition depends strongly on geometry .",
    "for instance , @xmath37 in 2d structures like films is satisfied at much higher frequencies ( ghz ) than in 1d structures like wires .",
    "this is simply due to the optimal circular shape of wires that contains in an optimal fashion the flux while , simultaneously , carrying the ac current .",
    "+ in terms of gmi performance , multilayered films ( such as f / m / f where f is a ferromagnet and m is metallic non magnetic material ) are preferred with respect to single layered films since they allow to inject the ac electric current in the metallic layer and sense the magnetic flux in neighbouring or sandwiching magnetic layers .",
    "these can be in direct contact with the metallic layer or separated from it by an insulator or a semiconductor .",
    "flux closure , that increases gmi , occurs when the width of the film ( transverse with respect to the ac current ) is large or that the metallic layer is entirely buried in the magnetic structure to trap the flux .",
    "+ the progress of gmi is thrusted towards the increase of the largest value of the ratio @xmath38 and the sensitivity given by the derivative of the ratio with respect to the field ( see table iii for some illustrative values ) . + this sensitivity",
    "is simply estimated by looking at the behaviour of the permeabilty @xmath39 versus @xmath0 as the frequency is changed .",
    "we ought to have a large variation of @xmath39 about @xmath34 .",
    "this happens , in general , at low frequencies that is when @xmath37 . at high frequencies",
    ", we will show in later sections that this sensitivity is either lost or one has to go to higher @xmath0 to observe it hampering the use of the effect in small magnetic field detection .",
    "+ applications of gmi range from tiny magnetic field detection and sensing ( such as magnetic recording heads ) to magnetic field shielding ( to degauss cathode ray tubes ( crt ) monitors ) .",
    "the reason is that gmi materials , being soft , possess large permeabilities that are required in magnetic shielding . +",
    "this work is organised as follows : in section ii , a general discussion on soft materials is presented ; in section iii , gmi in wires is described . in section iv , gmi in films and ribbons",
    "is dicussed .",
    "section v highlights potential applications of gmi effect in electronic ans sensing devices while section vi bears conclusions and perspectives of gmi .",
    "soft ferromagnetic materials ( sfm ) used in gmi applications play a key role in power distribution , make possible the conversion between electrical and mechanical energy , underlie microwave communication , and provide both the transducers and the active storage material for data storage in information systems .",
    "the fingerprint of any magnetic material is its hysteresis loop ( hl ) whose characteristic shape stems from two essential properties of magnetic materials : non - linearity and delay between input and output signals .",
    "non - linearity is given by the shape of the loop whereas the delay is given by the width of the hl .",
    "the quantities associated with the hl are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . in general , magnetic materials being anisotropic",
    "their hl width varies with the angle the external magnetic field makes with some given direction .",
    "the easy axis direction is defined as the direction for which the hl width ( or coercive field @xmath40 ) is largest .",
    "+ the coercive field @xmath40 represents the effort to demagnetise any magnetic material . for instance , hard magnetic materials exhibit large resistance to demagnetization and are therefore used in materials requiring permanent magnets whereas sfm are used in devices demanding little effort to demagnetise or remagnetise .",
    "hard magnets are used as permanent magnets for many electrical applications .",
    "some rare - earth alloys based on smco@xmath41 and sm(co , cu)@xmath42 are used for small motors and other applications requiring an extremely high energy - product magnetic materials .",
    "fe - cr - co alloys are used in telephone receivers and nd - fe - b is used for automotive starting motor .",
    "+ in contrast , sfm possess a narrower loop than hard materials and the area within the hysteresis curve is small .",
    "this keeps the energy losses small , during each magnetic cycle , in devices based on these materials .",
    "+ in order to qualify the different requirements for read heads and storage media in magnetic recording , an area belonging to the application portfolio of sfm ( besides sensing and shielding ) , table iv displays the desired characteristics .",
    "+ sfm have high permeability ( i.e. easily magnetized ) with a low coercivity ( i.e. easily demagnetized ) . examples of soft ferromagnetic materials include fe alloys ( with 3 to 4% si ) used in motors and power transformers and generators .",
    "ni alloys ( with 20 to 50% fe ) used primarily for high - sensitivity communications equipment .",
    "this illustrates the versatility of sfm applications that range from mechanical to electrical and from power to communications systems .",
    "+ sfm exhibit magnetic properties only when",
    "they are subject to a magnetizing force such as the magnetic field created when current is passed through the wire surrounding a soft magnetic core .",
    "they are generally associated with electrical circuits where they are used to amplify the flux generated by the electric currents .",
    "these materials can be used in ac as well as dc electrical circuits .",

    "rapidly quenched ferromagnetic materials 4 .",
    "amorphous magnetic materials 5 .",
    "nanocrystalline magnetic materials    the soft ferromagnetic behavior in these materials arises from a spatial averaging of the magnetic anisotropy of clusters of randomly oriented small particles ( typically @xmath43 fraction of a micron ) . in some cases , the ms of these materials is also reduced to near zero .",
    "metallic glasses obtained by rapid quench ( e.g. splat - cooling ) are magnetically very soft .",
    "this property is used in multilayered metallic glass power transformer cores .",
    "amorphous magnetic alloys such as cop first reported in 1965 and splat - cooled materials with attractive soft ferromagnetic properties are based either on 3d transition metals ( t ) or on 4f rare - earth metals ( r ) . in the first case , the alloy can be stabilized in the amorphous state with the use of glass forming elements such as boron , phosphorus and silicon : examples include fe@xmath44 b@xmath45 , fe@xmath46 ni@xmath46p@xmath47 b@xmath48 , and co@xmath49 fe@xmath50 b@xmath51 si@xmath52 ( t@xmath53 m@xmath54 , with @xmath55 at % , approximately ) . the transition metals of late order ( tl where tl = fe , co , ni ) can be stabilized in the amorphous state by alloying with early order transition metals ( te ) of 4d or 5d type ( te= zr , nb , hf ) : some examples are co@xmath56 zr@xmath57 , fe@xmath58 nb@xmath59 b@xmath60 , and co@xmath61 nb@xmath47 b@xmath60 ( te@xmath54 tl@xmath53 , where @xmath62 is roughly @xmath63 at % ) . +",
    "nanocrystalline soft magnetic materials are derived from crystallizing amorphous ribbons of a specific composition such as the ( fe , b ) based alloy family .",

    "the finemet family is characterized by an optimum grain size of about 15 nm , exhibits good properties at high frequencies and is comparable to some of the best ( and relatively costly ) co based amorphous materials . on the other hand , the grain sizes consistent with optimum performance are larger , around about 25 nm , in the nanoperm family .",
    "the distinguishing feature of the nanoperm family of alloys is the very low energy loss exhibited at low frequencies ( 60 hz ) , offering the potential for application in electrical power distribution transformers . +",

    "@xcite the behaviour of the permeability can be understood on the basis of a simple phenomelogical model based on a single relaxation time @xmath83 for the magnetization that yields for the permeability : @xmath84    the behaviour of @xmath39 depicted in fig .  [ fig4 ] indicates that the strongest variation of @xmath39 with @xmath0 happens at low frequencies as required for a sensitive sensor whereas the variation gets totally smeared out at large frequencies .",
    "it also illustates the existence of a finite frequency range for the gmi effect as already observed in fig .",
    "the range is determined by the inverse time 1/@xmath83 that controls relaxation processes of the transverse magnetization . +",
    "while gmr is usually attributed to the differential scattering of conducting electrons whose spins make particular angles with the local magnetization of different scattering centers , it was believed , like gmr , this effect also resulted from the electron scattering by ac current - induced domain wall oscillations .",
    "many different models exist for the description of permeability of metallic samples .",
    "such models start with a uniform dc permeability throughout the sample , and then consider a class of domain structures with a magnetization process of dwd or domain magnetization rotations ( dmr ) . in the case of ac impedance ,",
    "standard quantitative models are used without considering domain structures .",
    "therefore , some current explanations of mi have to be made based on usual considerations with some additional modifications to include concepts of dwd , dmr , ferromagnetic resonance , and magnetic relaxation . for a straight wire of radius @xmath17 , conductivity @xmath13 and permeability @xmath14 ( see fig .

    "the possible devices are recording read heads , magnetic guidance devices in vehicles , boats and planes ( with or without gps , i.e. global positioning system ) , brain imaging ( magneto - encephalogram or meg devices ) and heart mapping ( magneto - cardiogram or mcg devices ) etc ... + the detection of the earth magnetic field has a host of applications for instance in petroleum or minerals exploration or in shielding used for degaussing of high performance crt monitors ... + the general features required for sensors are not only high sensitivity , flexibility , large bandwidth and lost cost but linearity is also a desired feature . in order to increase the sensitivity of gmi devices with respect to the dc magnetic field",
    ", devices were developed @xcite possessing non - symmetric variation of the mi with respect to @xmath0 .",
    "the materials used are field annealed co - based amorphous ribbons ( co@xmath77 fe@xmath60 nib@xmath47 si@xmath20 ) ( see table iii ) .",
    "the asymmetry of the mi profile allows a very sensitive detection of the magnetic field specially around @xmath122 and when the asymmetry of the profile is so sharp that it becomes step - like , we have a so - called `` gmi valve '' based device . in these devices",
    ", the sensitivity might be enhanced to reach 1000%/oe ( compare with values in table iii ) .",
    "asymmetry may also be induced by torsional stress such as in wires of fe@xmath123si@xmath42 b  @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "altering the gmi response with mechanical stress paves the way toward the development of strain sensors that can be used in several areas of engineering and science .",
    "good candidates for gmi are amorphous cobalt rich ribbons , wires , glass covered microwires and multilayers made of a metallic layer sandwiched between ferromagnetic materials ( with or without intermediate insulating layers ) . + zero - field annealing or annealing under a magnetic field or with the application of some mechanical stress favors orienting the magnetization along a desired direction . in order to get a fast reduction of the transverse permeability ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) under the application of an external field @xmath0 , there must be an optimal distribution of the magnetization around the desired direction @xcite and that can be obtained with suitable growth or annealing conditions .",
    "reduction of the stress contained into the as - grown materials by sputtering or quenching can also be obtained with annealing .",
    "+ the current activity in gmi studies is oriented toward the development of devices using a built - in magnetic field rather than an applied external field .",
    "this is reminescent of the p - n , schottky , heterojunctions etc ... where the built - in field is electrical .",
    "+ the discovery of magnetic bias produced a revolution in magnetism because of the many potential applications in storage , sensing , spintronics ... nevertheless , there are other ways to produce built - in magnetic fields . for instance ueno et al .",
    "@xcite produced susch an internal field by superposing two sputtered films of co@xmath124 fe@xmath125 b  @xmath45 with crossed anisotropy axes , i.e. with the anisotropy axis of the bottom layer making angles of opposite sign with some common direction . +",
    "while gmi in wires and ribbons is steadily progressing , the case of single layered films is still lagging behind in favor of multilayered films .",
    "ways must be developed in order to increase the sensitivity of single or multilayered structures in order to reach the level observed in wires and microwires .",
    "the range of applications will substantially explode once gmi in thin films will be competitive with wires and ribbons .",
