    "after many years of studies of the fluctuational effects on various properties of superconductors , the discovery of high-@xmath1 superconductors ( htc ) has given new impulse to the study of fluctuational effects above the critical temperature @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , high critical temperatures , short coherence lengths and strong anisotropy greatly enhance the temperature range of observation of fluctuational effects . this fact has led to the search for extensions of theoretical models , such as ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory , to temperature ranges even well above @xmath1.@xcite + in general , fluctuational effects have been widely investigated in the past , both in conventional , low-@xmath1 ( ltc ) superconductors@xcite and in high-@xmath1 cuprates ( htc ) . among the various effects affected by thermal fluctuations , the dc excess conductivity above @xmath1 has been experimentally studied most extensively.@xcite theoretical investigations dates from the sixties,@xcite and development of this topic proceeded until the discovery of htcs . with some noticeable exception,@xcite",
    "the attention was always focussed in the temperature region close to the critical temperature . in that region , it is customary to discuss the data in terms of the aslamazov - larkin@xcite ( al ) and maki - thompson@xcite contributions .",
    "alternatively , the data are often described in terms of gaussian fluctuations , which by the simpler formalism of ginzburg - landau theory yield the same results as the microscopic al approach@xcite in clean superconductors .",
    "+ while such treatments are in principle valid only close to @xmath1 , in htcs the range of observation of fluctuational effects is much wider .",
    "thus , analysis of the data only in the strict proximity of @xmath1 would miss a substantial amount of information , eventually leading to incomplete conclusions .",
    "tools for investigating a wider temperature range are then not only interesting by themselves , but necessary for the study of htc compounds .",
    "+ hystorically , it was recognized very early @xcite that the experimental dc excess conductivity dropped much faster than predicted by , e.g. , al theory,@xcite when temperature was raised above @xmath1 . early works@xcite attributed this behavior to the unphysical contribution of high momentum modes to the fluctuation conductivity : close to @xmath1 the uniform mode ( @xmath4 ) is the most diverging one , so that the contributions of the other modes are automatically negligible , but at even slightly higher temperatures this is no longer true , and one has to manage somehow the other contributions .",
    "an essentially similar framework , both in the experimental results and theoretical arguments , applied to the fluctuation diamagnetism above @xmath1.@xcite in fact , the relevance of short or long wavelength modes is a rather general issue of the physics of phase transitions : it is here interesting to note that arguments similar to those developed in this paper were raised , e.g. , in the treatment of the electrical resistivity in magnetic systems.@xcite + in most theoretical calculations a phenomenological approach was used : the dc excess conductivity was calculated within the time - dependent ginzburg - landau ( tdgl ) theory .",
    "bearing in mind that within this approach slow variations of the order parameter ( on the scale of @xmath5 , the coherence length ) are required,@xcite so that short - wavelength fluctuations are unphysical , a high-@xmath6 cutoff was imposed.@xcite a numerical approach was almost everywhere used , apart from a few analytical results in some special cases.@xcite + a second approach , grounded on microscopic calculations , was employed in early works to obtain the flluctuation diamagnetism.@xcite the calculation of fluctuational conductivity was carried out by a.varlamov and co - workers in several papers,@xcite within the lawrence - doniach ( ld ) model for layered superconductors ( that in the high temperature range reduces to a collection of two - dimensional superconducting sheets ) . in this case",
    "the basis was the calculation of the full energy and momentum dependence of the fluctuation propagator and of the green functions.@xcite the dc conductivity was then calculated also for temperatures well above @xmath1 . +",
    "both these approaches gave as a result a strongly reduced dc excess conductivity well above @xmath1 .",
    "a detailed comparison between the microscopic and the cutoffed , gl model for clean 2d superconductors has been given in ref .",
    ", where it was shown that , with an appropriate choice of the cutoff , the two formulations gave the same temperature dependence of @xmath7 .",
    "+ comparisons with experiments were made on various materials : the phenomenological approach was successfully compared to data for the dc excess conductivity in amorphous alloys@xcite and yba@xmath8cu@xmath9o@xmath10 ( ybco ) films@xcite and crystals@xcite within a three - dimensional model , and in bi@xmath8sr@xmath8cacu@xmath8o@xmath11 ( bscco ) crystals@xcite and tapes@xcite with a two - dimensional expression .",
    "the 2d limit of the microscopic calculation@xcite was shown to be in agreement with the data in bscco films.@xcite in all cases the agreement extended at least up to @xmath12 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that a doping dependence of the cutoff number was found in bscco crystals,@xcite thus opening interesting issues about possible links between the phenomenological cutoff approach and microscopic properties .",
    "+ in addition to the studies of the dc conductivity , a few papers appeared which dealt with the finite - frequency excess conductivity , mainly in the microwave range,@xcite together with the corresponding theoretical treatments.@xcite in general , early experimental works@xcite were found to agree reasonably well with pure gaussian models,@xcite while the data in htc showed a possible evidence for critical behavior close to @xmath1.@xcite differently from the dc case , only a very few preliminary works@xcite explored the high temperature regime . in these cases ,",
    "extra conductivity lower than the gaussian expectation was experimentally found , but no simple theoretical expressions were given .",
    "it is interesting to note that none of the reported microwave studies has shown evidence for the maki - thompson term , neither in low-@xmath1 nor in high-@xmath1 superconductors , as opposed to some dc experiments.@xcite in addition , recent microscopic theoretical results have shown that in the ultraclean limit the fluctuationl conductivity is entirely given by the al term , since the other contributions cancel out.@xcite we find in these facts strong motivation for the present study . + it should be mentioned that the cutoff approach is still a debated topic.@xcite however , it is a matter of fact that , to the lowest level , it gives a very good description of the data , while on fundamental grounds it is believed@xcite to be a fundamental aspect of the gl theory .",
    "+ in this paper we present an explicit calculation of the finite - frequency excess conductivity based upon the tdgl theory .",
    "we phenomenologically introduce the short wavelength cutoff in the fluctuational spectrum . differently from previous results , we obtain closed forms for the dynamic excess conductivity .",
    "formulae are presented for thin wires ( one - dimensional systems , 1d ) , thin films ( 2d ) and bulk ( 3d ) superconductors .",
    "we explicitly include the in - plane anisotropy for the 2d case , and the three - axis anisotropy for the 3d case .",
    "our results extend previous calculations in several ways : _",
    "i ) _ to different dimensionalities , _ ii ) _ including the frequency dependence , _ iii ) _ giving explicit expressions for the cutoffed excess conductivity .",
    "+ we discuss some of the features that can be expected in the experimental data when entering the short - wavelength regime .",
    "we expect that our calculations might be useful for the description of the frequency - dependent excess conductivity not too close to @xmath1 .",
    "we use tdgl theory in order to investigate the main effects of a short - wavelength cutoff on the finite frequency conductivity .",
    "we work in absence of a dc magnetic field .",
    "we calculate the current response to a plane - wave electric field @xmath13 . throughout the paper we use sistme international units for the ease of comparison of the results with the experiments .",
    "the gl functional is written in the general case as :    @xmath14 \\label{th1}\\ ] ]    where the symbols have the following usual definitions : + the vector potential @xmath15 ; + @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the reduced temperature ; @xcite + @xmath18 is twice the electronic charge ; + @xmath19 are the masses of the pair along the main crystallographic directions . since we deal with the general case of anisotropic superconductors , all of them are in principle different .",
    "+ the gl coherence lengths along the different axes are then defined as usual as @xmath20 + we are mainly interested in the behavior not too close to @xmath1 , so that in the following we neglect the term @xmath21 altogether ( inclusion of this terms can be relevant very close to @xmath1@xcite ) .",
    "our aim is to calculate the longitudinal dynamical conductivity along the axis of application of the ac field , chosen to be the @xmath22 axis . in the following",
    "we will consider three distinct  dimensionalities \" : + _ i ) _ 1d : thin superconducting wire , which we take to lay along the @xmath22 axis .",
    "the section of the wire is assumed to be a square of side @xmath23 , with @xmath24",
    ". only @xmath25 , @xmath26 are relevant .",
    "+ _ ii ) _ 2d : thin superconducting film , which is taken to lay in the @xmath27 plane . the thickness @xmath28 . both @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) and @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) are relevant .",
    "+ _ iii ) _ 3d : bulk anisotropic superconductor .",
    "the axes are taken along the crystallographic axes .",
    "all three masses and coherence lengths are relevant .",
    "+ we do not rewrite all the preliminary calculations , that can be found elsewhere.@xcite instead , we sketch the path that has been followed . the time evolution of the order parameter , needed in order to calculate the dynamical conductivity , is determined by the tdgl equation describing relaxational dynamic for @xmath31 , which is taken to include a white noise term . at this stage , the characteristic relaxation rate @xmath32 is introduced .",
    "@xcite + the response to the field @xmath33 is determined by the current operator averaged with respect to the noise ( represented below by the brackets ) , and it can be expressed as a function of the correlation function of the order parameter @xmath34 at equal times :    @xmath35 \\ \\label{corrente}\\ ] ]    where the momentum dependence has been shifted from @xmath36 to the new vector @xmath37 .",
    "+ the correlator has been calculated by , e.g. , a.t.dorsey@xcite in the gaussian approximation .",
    "we limit ourselves to the treatment of the linear response ( we note however that the present approach has been used to calculate the nonlinear excess conductivity close to @xmath1 , ref . ) . within the linear response ,",
    "all the quadratic terms in the vector potential can be neglected , and the equal time correlator reads:@xcite    @xmath38 + \\right .",

    "then , inserting eq.[correlatore ] in eq.[corrente ] and performing the integrals for the appropriate dimensionalities one gets the well known gaussian results.@xcite + as discussed in the introduction , we wish to phenomenologically extend the applicability range of the calculation to temperatures not too close to @xmath1 , so that we explicitly discard the short - wavelength fluctuations by inserting a high-@xmath6 cutoff in the integration of eq.[corrente ] .",
    "there are several possible choices for this task . in the calculation of the dc conductivity with the aim of the kubo formula",
    ", gauzzi@xcite has chosen a different cutoff for each @xmath6-component .",
    "hopfengartner et al.@xcite have chosen , for the special case of ybco taken as a uniaxial superconductor , the same cutoff for @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and a different one on @xmath41 .",
    "johnson et al.@xcite used a cutoff on the modulus of @xmath6 in order to describe results on 3d , isotropic superconductors . + it is worth stressing that in the comparison with the experiments , each cutoff becomes a new fitting parameter .",
    "it is in general important to reduce the number of such parameters , and particularly in a calculation like this , where phenomenological modifications are made . to meet this requirement , it is useful to note that on physical grounds the cutoff is measured in units of the inverse temperature - independent correlation length,@xcite @xmath42 . in homogeneous superconductors , even if anisotropic ,",
    "there are no evident reasons for which a different number of @xmath42 should be used as a cutoff in different directions .",
    "we then introduce a single cutoff such that @xmath43^{2}}<\\lambda$ ] in eq.[corrente ] .",
    "we mention that this choice might be questionable when explicitly dealing with layered superconductors , where there is indeed a physical difference for in - plane and out - of - plane properties .",
    "this would require the use of the lawrence - doniach@xcite or similar model , which is not the purpose of this work .",

    "there are several interesting features that emerge from the novel relations , eqs.[sigma3d],[sigma2d],[sigma1d ] and the corresponding dc expressions .",
    "we first discuss shortly some peculiarities of the dc conductivity ( eqs.[dc3d],[dc2d],[dc1d ] ) that seem to have been unnoticed in previous works . +",
    "a plot of the cutoff correction to the gaussian paraconductivity , @xmath75 , is reported in fig.[figdc ] for @xmath76=0.74.@xcite it is apparent that the correction is stronger for higher dimensionalities.@xcite it is instructive to investigate the cases @xmath66 ( that is , the close vicinity of @xmath1 ) and @xmath77 ( that is , high reduced temperatures and/or strong cutoff effects ) .",
    "the latter case is more an oversimplification than a physically reachable limit , but it is very convenient in order to obtain analytical expressions . as can be derived from eqs.([dc3d],[dc2d],[dc1d ] ) , in all the three cases one obtains the same temperature dependence , namely : @xmath78 [ dcalta ] where @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 .",
    "the effect of the cutoff does change with the dimensionality ( different powers of @xmath76 ) , but only through a different prefactor , so that the determination of the dimensionality from the data at high @xmath3 should be carried on with care .",
    "in particular , it is tempting to identify the dimensionality from some power law of the excess conductivity with @xmath3 .",
    "this is surely not possible far from @xmath1 , where the power law appears to be the same for all the dimensionalities .",
    "this fact could be somehow expected , since the introduction of the swl cutoff introduces an additional length in the system , relevant far from the transition .",
    "even a quantitative comparison , in the case e.g. of htcs , might not allow for unambiguous identification of the dimensionality : taking as an example @xmath82 and reasonable @xmath83 , one has to compare @xmath84 with @xmath85 . in the case of bscco , taking @xmath863.3@xmath87 , the thickness of the double cuo layers , and @xmath881@xmath87 , the two prefactors are of the very same order of magnitude . in general , only a quantitative comparison in a wide temperature dependence can give indications on the effective dimensionality .",
    "+ we now turn to the discussion of the frequency dependence .",
    "we restrict this part of the discussion to the 2d and 3d cases , since we are not aware of experimental results for the dynamic conductivity in 1d systems .",
    "we discuss the temperature and frequency dependencies by means of the reduced variables @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the use of @xmath91 as a reduced variable does not require the exact determination of the gl relaxation time .",
    "however , for numerical estimates , assuming the bcs - derived value for @xmath32 one has @xmath92 for @xmath93=10 ghz : @xmath94 even in the microwave region .",
    "+ we employ the useful plots@xcite of the conductivity normalized to the gaussian ( uncutoffed ) results ( note that by using these plots the effects of the anisotropy cancel out ) .",
    "+ in fig.[fig3deps ] we plot the real and imaginary part of the conductivity normalized to the gaussian values , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 , in the 3d case for various values of the cutoff number , @xmath76 , as a function of the reduced temperature @xmath3 and @xmath97 .",
    "as can be seen , the presence of a swlc strongly depresses the dynamic conductivity at high @xmath3 .",
    "we note that the correction is much stronger on @xmath98 than on @xmath99 . for cutoff number @xmath100 and @xmath101 the real part",
    "is reduced by @xmath102 with respect to the uncutoffed value , while the imaginary part remains at @xmath103 of the uncutoffed value .",
    "we also note that the effects of the cutoff are significant even at reduced @xmath104 , that is almost in the full accessible temperature range , apart the small region very close to @xmath1 ( where , however , additional complications arise due to the possible entering of the critical region ) . + the frequency dependence is best studied with the plots at fixed @xmath3 and variable @xmath91 , as reported in fig.[fig3dot ] for three reduced temperatures and @xmath100 .",
    "it is easy to notice that for all the @xmath3 depicted , the effect of the cutoff does not introduce a significant frequency dependence neither in @xmath98 , nor in @xmath99 , up to very high frequencies ( at the high edge of the microwave spectrum ) .",
    "the same figure shows again the larger effect of the cutoff on @xmath98 than in @xmath99 . + the fact that , for reasonable cutoff numbers and frequencies , the frequency dependence of the correction is nearly flat , while the temperature dependence changes with respect to the uncutoffed value , has a rather intriguing consequence : in fact , as recalled in sec.[model ] , the gaussian dynamic conductivity can be cast in a scaling form : @xmath105 , where @xmath106 in the gaussian regime .",
    "our present results still predict an _ approximate _ scaling , but the temperature dependence of @xmath47 is apparently different from the uncutoffed result.@xcite the exact scaling prediction@xcite is reinstated for infinite cutoff .",
    "it would be interesting to perform wideband measurements in an extended temperature range above @xmath1 in view of this novel feature of the theoretical expressions .",
    "+ essentially the same features , but with a less pronounced effect of the cutoff are exhibited by 2d systems , as shown by fig.s [ fig2deps ] and [ fig2dot ] .",
    "we then expect that in strongly layered systems the frequency dependence of the dynamic paraconductivity is essentially unaffected by the cutoff in a resonably wide temperature range ( up to @xmath107 ) , while effects of the cutoff should be easier to observe in measurements of the real part of the paraconductivity at fixed frequencies and variable @xmath3 .",
    "+ we now discuss our results in comparison with experimental data for the microwave excess conductivity in high-@xmath1 superconductors .",
    "it should be noted that most of the microwave data , where one might observe some significant effect of the frequency , were devoted to studies well inside the superconducting state or , at most , of the critical regime very close to @xmath1 . as a consequence , there are nearly no published data ( to our knowledge ) of the finite - frequency excess conductivity , in temperature ranges extended enough above @xmath1 . in order to assess the question wether or not our cutoff approach describes the correct trend in the observations , we consider the data for the complex excess conductivity above @xmath1 taken in zn - doped ybco crystals.@xcite in this case , a ginzburg - landau - like analysis suggested that the compound behaves nearly as a 2d system,@xcite but the overall magnitude of the excess conductivity was about half of the theoretical prediction when the cell unit ( @xmath10811.7 ) was taken as effective layer separation . in fig.[figexp ] we plot the measured complex excess conductivity at 25 and 36 ghz ( as digitized from ref . ) , the 2d gl prediction ( @xmath109 ) at 36 ghz and the 2d , cutoffed curve at the two frequencies for @xmath110 ( that is,@xcite a momentum cutoff of @xmath111 ) .",
    "the result is encouraging : in particular , a nearly quantitative fit is obtained not too close to @xmath1 ( we do not discuss the possible occurence of a dimensional crossover approaching @xmath1 ) , without adjusting the other parameters,@xcite thus demonstrating that the proposed extension of the gl theory can correctly describe the features experimentally observed .",
    "new measurements , in extended temperature ranges above @xmath1 , would be extremely useful to check the applicability of the momentum - cutoff scenario .",
    "in conclusion , we have performed a ginzburg - landau calculation of the dynamic conductivity in anisotropic bulk , thin films and thin wires superconductors . according to the general prescriptions of the gl theory,@xcite",
    "we have introduced a short - wavelength cutoff in the spectrum of the accessible momenta .",
    "we have derived closed forms for the dynamic conductivity in the three cases abovementioned , that can be directly used for data fitting . we have predicted peculiar behaviors of the complex conductivity as the short - wavelength regime shows up .",
    "the analysis of some of the existing data for the finite - frequency conductivity finds a description in terms of the model here presented .",
    "more data are required to discuss the details of the excess conductivity at microwave frequencies .",
    "we thank r.raimondi and s.sarti for useful discussions , d.neri for stimulating our interest in this field and for many useful discussions in the early stage of this work , m.w.coffey for sending ref . prior to publication and for useful discussions , and t.mishonov for stimulating correspondence and useful suggestions .",
    "it is a recently debated topic wether the momentum cutoff here adopted should be or not replaced by a cutoff in the total energy of the pair.@xcite in the 3d energy cutoff scenario , the number @xmath76 should be replaced by @xmath112 , with @xmath113 a new cutoff number , so that momentum - cutoff expressions can be easily rewritten in terms of energy cutoff ( for a discussion , we address the reader to the review , ref . ) .",
