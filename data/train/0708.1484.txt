    "the nand tree quantum walk is described by the transmission coefficient of a series of coupled states , shown in fig .",
    "each `` state '' @xmath7 in the graph corresponds to the lowest orbital state of a quantum dot in the coulomb blockade regime , with @xmath8 labeling the bottom quantum dot at level @xmath9 and @xmath10 labeling the @xmath11th dot at the @xmath12th level .",
    "we assume a large orbital level spacing @xmath13 , where @xmath4 is the average tunnel coupling in the tree of dots .",
    "the coupled dot hamiltonian can be written : @xmath14 where @xmath15 describes the addition of a ( spin - less ) electron on the @xmath16th dot near the charge transition from @xmath17 .",
    "each dot can have a slight detuning from the fermi energy of @xmath18 , and each dot @xmath16 is tunnel coupled to dots @xmath19 and @xmath20 with a tunnel coupling @xmath21 , forming a physical binary tree structure .",
    "inputs in the top of the tree .",
    "nodes are labeled from 1 to 15 .",
    "each node can be realized as a quantum dot , with the links between nodes represented by tunnel coupling between linked dots .",
    "detunings @xmath22 applied to dots @xmath23 at the `` top '' of the tree set the local potential to be off of the coulomb blockade peak for dot @xmath23 if @xmath24 .",
    "the conductance of the dot @xmath25 at the bottom of the tree , near zero bias ( @xmath26 ) , encodes the result of the nand operation .",
    "[ fig1],width=288 ]    at the top of the tree is an oracle ( @xmath27 ) , a quantum system with electron number operators @xmath28 coupled to the binary tree via @xmath29 .",
    "unlike previous work , we focus on a coupling that may be easy to implement physically : for example , the oracle could be a mesoscopic device capacitively coupled to the top of the tree",
    ". we will proceed with the case of an oracle in an eigenstate of the @xmath30 operators with eigenvalues @xmath31 each taking values 0 or 1 .",
    "this sets the detuning of dots at the top of the tree to @xmath32 .",
    "the algorithm progresses by the injection of an electron wavepacket into the bottom of the tree .",
    "this probes the green s function of the bottom quantum dot , which depends recursively on the green s functions for the left and right subtrees . for wavepackets with small energy spreads @xmath33 , the successive , coherent scattering events",
    "up and down the tree lead to either total transmission or total reflection of the wavepacket , where the result ( transmission or reflection ) is the final `` answer '' to the nand query for an input specified by the bits @xmath22 .",
    "a voltage probe in the linear response regime provides such an energy probe for the system : the conductance for electrons passing through the bottom of the tree encodes the result of the tree . to show that our approach works in the presence of dephasing and disorder , we develop a recursive description of the scattering green s function in the quantum dot tree in the spirit of previous work  @xcite .",
    "we now describe an approach to understanding the nand tree evaluation using a recursively defined green s function for single - particle propagation through the tree .",
    "if we consider a `` tree '' segment with a single state , @xmath34 , at the bottom , we can define the projectors @xmath35,@xmath36,@xmath37 , where @xmath36 projects into the subspace associated with the left side of the tree ( all states connected to dot 2 ) and @xmath37 similarly projects into the subspace associated with the right side .",
    "we can write the inverse green s function exactly  @xcite : @xmath38 this gives a recursive relation for the projected green s function @xmath39 for a state @xmath16 in terms of the green s functions for the subtrees connected to states @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the term @xmath42 is a measure of the charge - based dephasing the electron may be expected to encounter .    at the top ( largest fanout ) of the tree , we can write the single - state green s function @xmath43 which truncates the recursion relation . we remark that this recursion is only successful because the tree contains no loops ; otherwise , eq .  ( [ e : recursion ] ) would fail . in the disorder - free case ,",
    "@xmath44 for all @xmath16 and @xmath45 except for dots at the top of the tree with input bits @xmath46 , as described above .",
    "setting energy to units of @xmath4 , we consider the green s function at the top of the tree for the three different inputs .",
    "we set @xmath47 to be the sign of the detuning to illuminate the role the alternating sign @xmath48 plays .",
    "we assume @xmath49 . for dot @xmath11 ,",
    "tunnel coupled to @xmath50 and @xmath51 , we get ( to @xmath52 ) : @xmath53 as the @xmath47 alternate such that each paired `` 1 '' input has @xmath54 , the third term has no energy shift .",
    "we now identify green s functions of the forms @xmath55 where the `` 0 '' and `` 1 '' indicate the expected nand results for the inputs .",
    "any dependence on @xmath56 is removed by the alternation of @xmath47 for paired `` 1 '' inputs .",
    "we can include effect of disorder in the system , both in variations in @xmath57 and in variations in @xmath18 .",
    "both are likely to occur due differences in fabrication , low frequency noise on electrostatic gates ( such as those used to tune the system to the multi - dot regime ) and charge - fluctuators in the system .",

    "consisting entirely of the `` most dangerous case '' ( an input of the form 1011 ) subtrees of ref .  , we find @xmath70 , and @xmath71 , where the sum is over the set of all dots where both subtrees evaluate to 1 .",
    "the first term indicates that the green s function derived is only appropriate within an energy range @xmath72 about @xmath26 .",
    "this leads to the condition that the electron wavepacket be spread over a time @xmath73 , and sets @xmath74 scaling of the evaluation time . for random , uncorrelated noise , the second term ( with @xmath5 terms )",
    "has a root - mean - square of @xmath75 , and leads to an energy shift by that amount from the desired resonance at @xmath26 as well as a dephasing @xmath76 .",
    "this indicates that @xmath77 form the requirements for operation of the device .",
    "less difficult is the bounding requirement @xmath78 .",
    "we compared these results with numerical simulations and find consistent behavior for tree sizes up to @xmath79 . a sample with @xmath80 is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : qdconduct ] .",
    "we now detail how a quantum dot coupled to a linear voltage probe can measure the result of the nand tree well below the temperature limit of the leads .",
    "this is a generalization of sub - temperature spectroscopy used in double quantum dot transport measurements  @xcite .",
    "we write the green s function , including the self energies @xmath81for left and right leads coupled to the dot via @xmath82 , as @xmath83 by working well above the band - bottom of the leads ,",
    "we can write @xmath84 with @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the density of states near the fermi energy . the meir formalism  @xcite for the transmission @xmath87 $ ] yields @xmath88 -      \\gamma/2)^2 + ( e - t_1 ^ 2 { \\rm re}[g_1(e ) ] - \\epsilon_0)^2 } \\ ] ] the conductance follows from the landauer formula , @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the fermi distribution .",
    "a few remarks are in order .",
    "first , a pole at @xmath26 for @xmath91 leads to zero conductance , while a `` 1''-like green s function ( proportional to energy ) , leads to a peak at @xmath92 , thus letting the existence or absence of transport indicate a `` 1 '' or `` 0 '' result .",
    "second , when dephasing ( @xmath93 ) is weak , the transmission function is a lorentzian with a width at most @xmath94 . when convolved with the derivative of the fermi function at @xmath95 ,",
    "the edges of the fermi function are effectively damped , leading to sub - temperature energy resolution ( limited only by @xmath96 ) .",
    "to see these effects , we simulate the expected conductance as a function of @xmath97 and @xmath98 at @xmath99 in fig .  [",
    "f : qdconduct ] for an input of @xmath80 bits .",
    "cases resulting in `` 0 '' and `` 1 '' are both shown .",
    "for this scenario , we set @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "the temperature dependence can be mitigated by further reductions of @xmath96 .",
    "however , disorder , as described below , may limit the achievable resolution .     with outputs `` 0 '' ( blue , purple ) and `` 1 '' ( red , orange ) .",
    "the dependence of conductance on @xmath97 ( left ) and @xmath98 ( right ) are shown .",
    "disorder parameters @xmath102 ( red , blue ) and @xmath103 ( orange , purple ) are used . [",
    "f : qdconduct],width=288 ]",
    "one difficulty encountered for making large nand trees using this approach is the increasing perimeter of the tree as a function of tree depth ( @xmath1 versus @xmath104 ) . for sufficiently large trees , the spacing between successive levels @xmath12 and @xmath105 of the tree must grow as @xmath106 for a @xmath107-dimensional layout .",
    "furthermore , tunnel coupling exponentially decreases as the spacing between quantum dots increases , potentially limiting this approach to small trees .    as an alternative",
    ", `` dummy '' levels of the tree can be inserted : these are states coupled only to a single dot going up or down the tree ( fig .",
    "[ f : hfractal]a ) .",
    "each acts as an inverter , where the `` missing '' state is equivalent to the absence of a resonance in one `` leg '' of the tree , which is the `` 1''-type green s function .",
    "specifically , a state of either `` 0 '' or `` 1 '' type parameterized by @xmath108 becomes , after coupling through two inverters , @xmath109 . going a distance @xmath107 ( through @xmath110 inverters ) gives @xmath111        as an explicit construction , we consider the h - fractal ( fig .",
    "[ f : hfractal]b ) for the layout of quantum dots .",
    "the h - fractal is a binary tree structure comprised of an `` h '' with the two sides the same length as the middle bar . , and an area - to - dot size ratio of @xmath112 for an @xmath113-level tree .",
    "] this has the benefit that the distance between successive levels of the binary tree doubles for every _ two _ levels . a `` worst case '' trees ( again , with inputs 1011 ) has the mapping @xmath114 where the distance goes as @xmath115 at the @xmath12th level ( with @xmath113 the bottom of the tree ) .",
    "a tree comprised entirely of worst - case trees has @xmath116 this indicates that a 2d architecture leads to an overhead of @xmath117 for the evaluation of the tree . this still performs better than the best classical algorithm . as a final remark",
    ", we can selectively remove one of the pair of dots to produce a `` not '' operation inline with the following nand operation by opening the tunnel coupling between the pair of dots .",
    "this allows the tree evalutor to evaluate _",
    "boolean functions , not just nand trees .",
    "taking values @xmath118ev , @xmath119ev , @xmath120 mev , @xmath121ev , @xmath122ev , and @xmath123ev ( 20 mk dilution refrigerator electron temperature ) , we find the limiting algorithm size @xmath124 , where the limit is due to the disorder in the system .",
    "using the h - fractal layout , this corresponds to a mesoscopic region of area @xmath125mm@xmath126 for dot center - to - dot center spacing @xmath127 nm .",
    "this includes appropriate space for electrostatic gates or etched barriers .",
    "phase coherent transport over such large regions have been demonstrated in a number of experiments  @xcite .",
    "the expected evaluation time is of order @xmath128 ns ( to generate a differential signal of ten electrons , sufficient for fast detection ) .",
    "we can use this nand tree evaluator as a subsystem in a larger processing unit .",
    "the best known classical algorithm evaluates in @xmath129 time . using the quantum device as a sub - tree evaluator of a quantum oracle , a problem of size @xmath130",
    "can be evaluated in @xmath131 time , as subtrees of size @xmath132 can be calculated sequentially using the quantum subsystem as a hardware accelerator .",
    "better hybrid quantum - classical approaches may exist , but require further investigation .",
    "this paper illustrates a fundamental and heretofore unrecognized quality of the quantum nand algorithm .",
    "in particular , the entire nand quantum walk can be done with a single - electron wavepacket and appropriate resonances ( quantum dots ) .",
    "other approaches using classical waves , such as light in coupled cavities , would in principle have the same green s function .",
    "thus , from a quantum information perspective , the interesting part of the algorithm lies in the oracle : the quantum mechanical system which `` sets '' the inputs .",
    "we heretofore considered the oracle to be in an eigenstate of the number operators @xmath133 .",
    "if we describe the boolean function evaluation of the tree by @xmath134 or 1 , an arbitrary oracle state leads to an expected result of the tree of @xmath135 .",
    "for example , a two - level tree evaluates @xmath136 , a non - trival , high - order correlation function of the oracle .",
    "we now have the outstanding task of identifying interesting quantum systems to use as an oracle .",
