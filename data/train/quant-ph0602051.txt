    "as a valuable resource in quantum information and quantum computation [ 1 ] , quantum entanglement has attracted numerous attention over past decade years . in order to realize the quantum information process , a great deal of effort has been devoted to study and characterize the entanglement in solid state systems [ 2,3 ] .",
    "a typical example in solid system is the spin chains which are the natural candidates for the realization of the entanglement compared with the other physics systems .",
    "the heiserberg model can describe interaction of qubits not only in solid physical systems but also in many other systems such as quantum dots [ 4 ] and nuclear spin [ 5 ] ; therefore , there are numerous studies on the heisenberg models[6 - 13 ] .",
    "it is turned out that the critical magnetic field @xmath2 is decreased with the increase of the anisotropic parameter @xmath3 but the critical temperature @xmath4 is improved .",
    "when b crosses @xmath2 the concurrence c drops suddenly and then undergoes a ",
    "revival  for sufficiently large @xmath3 in ref [ 14 ] , but it only discussed the uniform magnetic field case . as we all know , in any solid state construction of qubits , there is always the possibility of inhomogeneous zeeman coupling [ 15,16 ] .",
    "quite recently the effect of inhomogeneous magnetic field on the thermal entanglement of an isotropic two - qubit @xmath5 spin system has been studied in ref [ 17 ] .",
    "including interaction of z - component @xmath6 , ref [ 18 ] also studied the effect of inhomogeneous magnetic field on the thermal entanglement in a two - qubit heisenberg @xmath7 spin chain .",
    "however , the entanglement for a @xmath0 spin model under an inhomogeneous magnetic field has not been discussed .",
    "therefore , in this paper we investigate the influence of an external inhomogeneous magnetic field on the entanglement of a two - qubit heisenberg @xmath0 system at thermal equilibrium .",
    "our studies show that the inhomogenerous extral magnetic field can make the revival entanglement larger , improve the critical temperature , and enhance entanglement .",
    "the heisenberg hamiltonian of a n - qubit anisotropic heisenberg @xmath0 model under an inhomogeneous magnetic field is    @xmath8 ,   \\label{eq1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) are the vector of pauli matrices and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) is the anisotropic coupling coefficient between the nearest two spins .",
    "the parameter @xmath14 means that the chain is antiferromagnetic , and ferromagnetic for @xmath15 .",
    "the magnetic fields on the nearest - neighbor two qubits are @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively , the value of @xmath1 controls the degree of inhomogeneity .    for a spin system in equilibrium at temperature @xmath18 ,",
    "the density matrix is @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the hamiltonian of this system , @xmath21 is the partition function and @xmath22 is the boltzmann constant . usually we write @xmath23 . for a two - qubit system",
    "the thermal entanglement can be measured by the concurrence @xmath24 which can be calculated with the help of @xmath25 formula@xcite @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the square roots of the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath28where the asterisk indicates complex conjugation , the concurrence @xmath24 ranges from zero to one .",
    "consider now the hamiltonian @xmath20 for the anisotropic two - qubit heisenberg @xmath29 chain in an inhomogeneous magnetic field .",
    "the hamiltonian can be shown as @xmath30where @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 . among these parameters @xmath34 are raising and lowering operators respectively and @xmath3 @xmath35 measures the anisotropy in the @xmath36 plane . in the standard basis @xmath37",

    "one can notice that these four eigenstates are all entanglement states when @xmath46 so it means that entanglement exists for both antiferromagnetic @xmath47 and ferromagnetic @xmath48 cases .",
    "now we can calculate the thermal entanglement of this system .",
    "the density matrix can be written as the following form @xmath49the square roots of the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath50 are @xmath51the exact values of these nonzero matrix elements can be obtained by knowing the spectrum of @xmath20 .",

    "the concurrence which is directly determined by @xmath64 is invariant under the substitutions @xmath65 and @xmath66 but the eigenvalue is variant with the substitution @xmath67 so that the concurrence is also different .",
    "we will take the cases @xmath68 and @xmath69 into account in this paper .    from eq.(7 ) and the definition of the concurrence , we derive the @xmath24 for @xmath70 as following @xmath71although the parameters @xmath72 , @xmath3 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 are independent of @xmath6 in the case of two interacting qubits , the value of @xmath6  is very important in determining the point of the piecewise function so that it can play role in the pairwise entanglement .",

    "consider first the nonuniform magnetic field ( @xmath89 ) case [ fig .",
    "1(a ) ] . with increasing @xmath1 ,",
    "the concurrence @xmath24 is initially constant and equal to its maximal value 1 .",
    "it then drops suddenly as a critical value @xmath90 is reached , where the critical inhomogeneous magnetic field @xmath90 is given by @xmath91 or @xmath92 . at the critical point ( @xmath86 , @xmath93 ) , the entanglement becomes a nonanalytic function of @xmath1 and a quantum phase transition occurs , but for @xmath94 the concurrence @xmath24 undergoes a revival before decreasing to zero .",
    "the critical inhomogeneous magnetic field @xmath90 is increased by increasing the anisotropy parameter @xmath3 , which means the region that entanglement keeps its maximum value is broaden with the increasing @xmath3 .",
    "however , for @xmath95 case , entanglement exhibits novel property shown in fig . 1(b ) . for certain relationship of the parameters ,",
    "the value of revival can be larger than its value before dropping , for example , fig1.(b ) @xmath96 curve .",
    "in addition , the region of entanglement keeping constant and entanglement values is increased with the increasing @xmath3 . in fig.1 ( c ) , we further show the role of @xmath6 in existing larger revival .",

    "the most important is that only when @xmath6 achieve certain values , the value of entanglement revival can larger than that of before dropping .",
    "now we discuss the conditions of existing revival and larger revival . from eq.(8 ) , we see if @xmath97  i.e. , @xmath98 , the concurrence @xmath24 will exhibit revival phenomenon .",
    "but if we need larger revival value , combining @xmath99 and @xmath100 , we have @xmath101 .",
    "therefore , the condition existing larger revival is as @xmath102     and @xmath6 , where @xmath87 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",

    "it then decreases suddenly as the critical inhomogeneous magnetic field @xmath90 is reached .",
    "however , instead of vanishing for @xmath111 , the concurrence persists and undergoes a revival before decreasing .",
    "the most important thing is that the value of entanglement revival can larger than that of before dropping .",

    "but when @xmath1 is larger than this certain value , there is no revival phenomenon and the entanglement is decreased monotonously with the increase of @xmath18 .",

    "we can observe that entanglement exists in two regions : the one is in large @xmath120 and small @xmath1 ; the other is in small @xmath3 and @xmath1 .",
