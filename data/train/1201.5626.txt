    "the origins of prosocial behavior in groups of unrelated individuals are difficult to trace down .",
    "there exist ample evidence indicating that between - group conflicts may have been instrumental for enhancing in - group solidarity @xcite . on the other hand , some argue that our pre - human ancestors may have been confronted by more pressing challenges then simply to avoid being wiped out by their neighbors .",
    "about two million years ago some hominids were beginning to evolve larger brains and body size and to mature more slowly than other apes , which likely procreated serious challenges in rearing offspring that survived @xcite .",
    "hence , alloparental care and provisioning for someone else s young have also been proposed as viable for igniting the evolution of the remarkable other - regarding abilities of the genus _",
    "homo _ that we witness today @xcite .",
    "regardless of its origins , it is a fact that cooperation in groups is crucial for the remarkable evolutionary success of the human species , and it is therefore of the outmost importance to identify mechanisms that might have spurred its later development @xcite .",
    "evolutionary game theory @xcite is firmly established as the theoretical framework of choice for those studying the emergence and sustainability of cooperation at different levels of organization @xcite .",
    "recent reviews attest clearly to the fact that interdisciplinary approaches , linking together knowledge from biology , sociology , economics as well as mathematics and physics , are especially successful in identifying new ways by means of which the successful evolution of cooperation amongst selfish and unrelated individuals can be understood @xcite .",
    "the public goods game , in particular , has proven itself times and again as the classic paradigm that succinctly captures the essential social dilemma that emerges as a consequence of group and individual interests being inherently different , which may ultimately result in the `` tragedy of the commons '' @xcite .",
    "governed by group interactions , the public goods game requires that players decide simultaneously whether they wish to contribute to the common pool , _",
    "i.e. _ to cooperate , or not . regardless of the chosen strategy , each member of the group receives an equal share of the public good after the initial investments are multiplied by a synergy factor that takes into account the added value of collaborative efforts .",
    "evidently , individuals are best off by not contributing anything to the common pool , _",
    "i.e. _ by defecting , while the group , and indeed the society as a whole , is most successful if everybody cooperates .",
    "recent research has made it clear that spatial structure plays a pivotal role by the evolution of cooperation , as comprehensively reviewed in @xcite .",
    "inspired by the seminal paper introducing games on grids @xcite , evolutionary games on graphs and complex networks @xcite have proven instrumental in raising the awareness of the fact that relaxing the simplification of well - mixed interactions may lead to qualitatively different results that are due to pattern formation and intricate organization of the competing strategies , which reveals itself in most unexpected ways . specifically for the spatial public goods game @xcite",
    ", it has recently been shown that inhomogeneous player activities @xcite , appropriate partner selection @xcite , diversity @xcite , the critical mass @xcite , heterogeneous wealth distributions @xcite , the introduction of punishment @xcite and reward @xcite , as well as both the joker @xcite and the matthew effect @xcite , can all substantially promote the evolution of public cooperation .    apart from rare exceptions , the large majority of previously published works assumed unconditional strategies , _",
    "i.e. _ cooperators that always cooperated and defectors that always defected .",
    "nevertheless , the usage of unconditional strategies constitutes a simplification that deserves further exploration .",
    "it is a fact that individuals , be it humans or animals , will likely behave differently under different circumstances .",
    "this invites the introduction of conditional strategies , by means of which such considerations can be appropriately taken into account . with this motivation",
    ", we here study the evolution of cooperation in the spatial public goods game containing conditional cooperators .",
    "conditional cooperators will contribute to the common pool only if there is a sufficiently high number of other conditional cooperators in the group . if not , conditional cooperators will defect , at least until the group acquires more players that are likely to cooperate . while the details of the model and the main results will be presented in the following two sections , beforehand , the key finding of this work is that conditional cooperators are able to quarantine defectors into isolated convex `` bubbles '' from where they are unable to exploit the public good , and in doing so warrant completely defector - free states even if the synergy factor is close to one .",
    "perhaps even more interestingly , we find that just the signalling of the willingness to cooperate , instead of a hard promise , is sufficient to elevate the level of collaborative efforts .",
    "as we will show , these observations rely on the spatial structure and can not be observed in well - mixed systems , although they are robust against the topological variations of the interaction network and the group size .",
    "the public goods game is staged on a square lattice with periodic boundary conditions where @xmath0 players are arranged into overlapping groups of size @xmath1 such that everyone is connected to its @xmath2 nearest neighbors .",
    "accordingly , each individual belongs to @xmath3 different groups .",
    "initially each player on site @xmath4 is designated either as a conditional cooperator ( @xmath5 ) , where @xmath6 , or defector ( @xmath7 ) with equal probability .",
    "conditional cooperators contribute a fixed amount ( here considered being equal to @xmath8 without loss of generality ) to the public good only if there are at least @xmath9 other players within the group @xmath10 who are also willing to cooperate ( whose strategy is @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 or @xmath15 ) while defectors contribute nothing .",
    "formally @xmath11 thus returns unconditional cooperators @xmath16 while @xmath17 returns unconditional defectors @xmath18 .",
    "note that in the presence of a player having strategy @xmath19 there can not be @xmath20 other conditional cooperators within a group .",
    "the sum of all contributions in each group is multiplied by the synergy factor @xmath21 and the resulting public goods are distributed equally amongst all the group members irrespective of their contributions .",
    "monte carlo simulations of the game are carried out comprising the following elementary steps . a randomly selected player @xmath4 plays the public goods game with its @xmath2 partners as a member of all the @xmath10 groups ,",
    "whereby its overall payoff @xmath22 is thus the sum of all the payoffs acquired in the five groups .",
    "next , player @xmath4 chooses one of its nearest neighbors at random , and the chosen co - player @xmath23 also acquires its payoff @xmath24 in the same way . finally , player @xmath4 enforces its strategy @xmath25 onto player @xmath23 with a probability @xmath26\\}$ ] , where @xmath27 quantifies the uncertainty by strategy adoptions @xcite , implying that better performing players are readily adopted , although it is not impossible to adopt the strategy of a player performing worse .",
    "such errors in decision making can be attributed to mistakes and external influences that adversely affect the evaluation of the opponent .",
    "each monte carlo step ( mcs ) gives a chance for every player to enforce its strategy onto one of the neighbors once on average .",
    "the average densities of conditional cooperators ( @xmath28 ) and defectors ( @xmath29 , alternatively denoted as @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) were determined in the stationary state after sufficiently long relaxation times .",
    "depending on the actual conditions ( proximity to phase transition points and the typical size of emerging spatial patterns ) the linear system size was varied from @xmath32 to @xmath33 and the relaxation time was varied from @xmath34 to @xmath35 mcs to ensure proper accuracy .",
    "it is worth pointing out that this is not a threshold - type model because the goods will always be shared between all the group members , even if the conditional cooperators will not all contribute .",
    "we note that the condition for conditional cooperators to cooperate introduced above is the most soft in terms of how many players are actually expected to cooperate .",
    "more precisely , it is likely that a very cautious cooperator ( with a high @xmath9 value ) will not cooperate , even though it may itself be reason enough for a less cautious cooperator to do so .",
    "hence , in our model conditional cooperators require only a positive signal , or what can be interpreted as an `` easy promise '' from other group members , rather than a definite mutual agreement to contribute to the common pool .",
    "a much more stricter and sophisticated condition would be that a player having @xmath36 will cooperate only if there are at least @xmath9 other players in the group whose index is less or equal to @xmath9 .",
    "this rule , imposing thus much stricter conditions , can only be applied if there is also at least one @xmath17 player ( unconditional defector ) in the group .",
    "note that without it this definition yields misleading commands to conditional defectors .",
    "for example , in a group containing players @xmath11 , @xmath14 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath15 , the strict @xmath37 rule would dictate defection for all @xmath14 players . in the following",
    ", we will refer to the dynamics relying on the `` more careful '' conditional strategies as the strict rule .",
    "we will comment on the outcome of such and other alternative models in the next section , where we now proceed with presenting the main results .",
    "it is instructive to first examine the evolution of a subset of all the possible strategies .",
    "figure  [ three ] shows the outcomes of three - strategy games , where besides the unconditional cooperators @xmath11 and defectors @xmath38 one conditionally cooperative strategy ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 or @xmath15 ) is initially present",
    ". depicted is the stationary density of defectors @xmath39 versus the synergy factor @xmath21 for the four possible strategy triples , as well as for the traditional two - strategy version of the spatial public goods game ( @xmath11 curve ) . in the latter case ,",
    "cooperators die out at @xmath40 , which is a well - known result @xcite . additionally introducing one type of conditional cooperators to the traditional setup",
    "continuously decreases the minimally required @xmath21 for cooperative behavior to survive as @xmath9 increases .",
    "most remarkably , if initially unconditional cooperators @xmath11 and defectors @xmath38 and conditional cooperators @xmath15 each occupy @xmath41 of the lattice , we find that defectors can not survive even in the @xmath42 limit ( @xmath15 curve ) .",
    "this indicates that simple conditional strategies have ample potential for elegantly avoiding the `` tragedy of the commons '' even under the worst of conditions .",
    "the critical value of @xmath21 where cooperators die out can be estimated by means of a simple approach that considers the competition between two ordered domains of strategies @xcite . as fig .",
    "[ stability ] illustrates , the elementary change which modifies the step - like interface between competing domains is an invasion across the dashed line between unequal strategies .",
    "assuming @xmath43 players as conditional cooperators and unconditional defectors , the accumulated payoffs of competing players are as follows : @xmath44 from this equation the critical synergy factor for the conditional cooperator strategy @xmath43 is @xmath45 .",
    "thus , even this simple analysis is able to reproduce the decreasing critical values of @xmath46 by increasing @xmath47 , and moreover , warns that unconditional defectors can not exist if a @xmath48 strategy is present .",
    "evidently , other elementary processes are also possible , but their contributions to the boundary velocity are smaller , and to consider them would make this analysis untraceable .",
    "what is important is to note that the result is independent of the group size @xmath20 , and is qualitatively valid for all lattice types .",
    "this is a straightforward consequence of the multi - point interaction of public goods games , which diminishes several microscopic differences of graphs and makes topological features like the clustering coefficient irrelevant @xcite .",
    "the latter are , of course , essential for games that are governed by pair - wise interactions @xcite .",
    "as evidenced by the stability analysis , the crucial property in the presently studied model , however , is the `` spatiality '' , allowing interfaces that separate domains of different strategies , which can only be fulfilled in structured populations .    turning to the complete six - strategy version of the spatial public goods game , we find that our main conclusion , arrived at based on the analysis of different three - strategy games , remains fully valid . in fig .",
    "[ lowr ] , we first present characteristic time courses of all six strategies over time as obtained for a very low value of @xmath21 . as expected based on results presented in fig .",
    "[ three ] , unconditional cooperators @xmath11 , as well conditional cooperators @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , albeit marginally latter , all die out fast due to invading defectors @xmath30 . however , after the defectors are left on their own with @xmath15 , they can not withstand the invasion of this strain of conditional cooperators and die out .",
    "interestingly , although @xmath15 appear to be eating into the territory of defectors from the very beginning of the evolutionary process , their full potential is unleashed only after all the other `` less cautious '' conditional cooperators die out .",
    "this is because although @xmath15 are obviously impervious to defectors , this is not necessarily the case with regards to other conditionally cooperative strategies . in particular , it may well be that under certain circumstances the lesser criteria for when to cooperate may yield a temporary advantage of @xmath49 over @xmath15 .",
    "thus in fact , the other cooperative strategies hinder @xmath15 at effectively invading defectors by invading @xmath15 themselves .",
    "this , however , is very short lived as defectors are able to invade @xmath49 extremely effectively at @xmath42 . in a rather twisted turn of events , defectors , by invading @xmath49 , actually pave the way themselves towards a premature extinction .",
    "although one could thus , in principle a least , hypothesize an alliance between @xmath49 and @xmath50 to successfully invade @xmath15 , our simulations reveal that the evolutionary window for such a complicated alliance to remain stable is too small to exist .    at high synergy factors , however , the outcome of the six - strategy public goods game is significantly different . as evidenced by results presented in fig .",
    "[ highr ] , at @xmath51 all the cooperative strategies are able to withstand being invaded by defectors .",
    "in fact , both @xmath15 and to a substantially lesser degree @xmath14 are able to do the exact opposite , which is to gain ground on the expense of retreating @xmath50 .",
    "importantly , however , after the defectors die out all five remaining strategies @xmath52 become completely equivalent .",
    "note that due to the soft condition , requiring only the presence of a certain number of conditional cooperator within the group , but regardless of their type ( see section ii for detail ) , all group members now receive the required number of positive signals from others to actually go ahead and contribute to the common pool .",
    "henceforth , the evolution becomes identical to that of the voter model @xcite , entailing logarithmically slow coarsening in the absence of surface tension @xcite .",
    "the final stationary state is thus determined primarily by the share of the square lattice that is occupied by any given strategy at the time of defector extinction .",
    "this interpretation can be made more precise by determining the fixation probabilities of the cooperative strategies in dependence on @xmath21 .",
    "results presented in fig .  [ fix ] indicate that , because of the neutral relations between the five cooperative strategies , which set in after the defector die out , the governing voter - model dynamics will , through coarsening , result in a homogeneous state where the system fixates into one of the remaining @xmath53 strategies , where @xmath54 .",
    "the fixation probability depends on the fraction of competing strategies at the time of @xmath55 , which in turn depend on the effectiveness of the cooperative strategies to invade unconditional defectors , and to a lesser degree also on their effectiveness to invade each other .",
    "based on the time evolutions presented in figs .",
    "[ lowr ] and [ highr ] , it is understandable that at low values of @xmath21 the fixation probability of @xmath15 will be practically one , while in the opposite limit the eventual dominance of either cooperative strain will be equally probable ( see fig .  [ fix ] ) .    in order to reveal the main mechanism behind the rather remarkable inability of defectors to survive in the presence of @xmath15 , it is instructive to visualize the spatial patterns emerging as a consequence of their direct competition",
    ". figure  [ snaps ] features a series of four characteristic snapshots that were taken at different times [ increasing from panel ( a ) to panel ( d ) ] where only the two mentioned strategies compete for space .",
    "while defectors are depicted black , for convenience we graphically distinguish between two types of @xmath15 players .",
    "namely between such that are predominantly active as cooperators , and such that are predominantly inactive or hidden .",
    "the criterion separating the two is simply the number of groups in which the player has actually contributed to the common pool .",
    "if the player , at the time the snapshot was taken , has cooperated in three or more out of the five groups where it is member , we mark it as active and depict it white , while otherwise , if it has cooperated in two or fewer groups , we mark it as inactive and depict it light blue ( gray if printed bw ) . with this graphical distinction , we reveal that the reason why defectors can not exploit @xmath15 effectively is due to the spontaneous emergence of very persistent interfaces of inactive @xmath15 players that separate cooperative and defective domains .",
    "since @xmath15 players immediately stop cooperating in a group that contains at least one @xmath50 , the defectors can not collect large , competitive payoffs near the interfaces ( and certainly not in the middle of the sea of @xmath18 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "hidden cooperators are still capable to collect significant payoffs from @xmath15 players that are on the opposite side of the interface , where in general the condition to actually cooperate will be fulfilled . in this way ,",
    "hidden cooperators do nt just shield the active cooperators from the invasion of defectors , but they can also effectively invade defectors to eventually completely dominate the whole population . the phalanx of hidden cooperators will quarantine unconditional defectors into convex isolated `` bubbles '' , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ bubble ] , which ultimately leads to an unavoidable `` tragedy of the defectors '' .    from the described workings of the mechanism ,",
    "it is clear that it can not emerge under well - mixed conditions , as then players adopting the @xmath15 strategy will essentially never actually cooperate , given that an encounter with at least one defector is virtually unavoidable . despite of this fact @xmath15s can survive , but they will always reveal only their defector face . accordingly , the `` tragedy of the commons '' can not be avoided by means of similar conditional strategies in well - mixed settings of the public goods game . on the other hand ,",
    "it is also clear that the mechanism is robust and potent not only on the square lattice , but in fact on all other types of interaction graphs where long - standing bonds between players are assumed ( note that certain coevolutionary rules @xcite , especially such that rely on frequent rewiring of the links between players , may render the mechanism dysfunctional ) .",
    "finally , we emphasize another positive message of this study , which is that cooperation can be promoted simply by the signaling of others that they are willing to cooperate , rather than a firm oath that they will actually do so .",
    "we have observed that our results remain valid also when introducing the more sophisticated conditional strategies , as discussed in section ii , although we find the usage of the more elegant and simple model much more rewarding and interesting .",
    "in summary , we have shown that an intuitive introduction of conditional cooperative strategies provides the ultimate boost to the mechanism of spatial reciprocity @xcite .",
    "in particular , the most cautious conditional cooperators provide an escape hatch out of the `` tragedy of the commons '' for all values of the synergy factor @xmath21 by spontaneously forming a protective shield between them and the defectors .",
    "the shield , however , makes it not only extremely difficult for defectors to exploit the collaborative efforts of others , but at the same time provides an evolutionary advantage to cooperators that enables their invasion of the territory of defectors , eventually leading to their complete dominance .",
    "the quarantining of defectors is crucial especially at very low values of @xmath21 , where otherwise they can reap huge benefits on the expense of cooperators . at intermediate and high values of @xmath21 , however , all the different strains of conditional cooperators become more and more able to withstand being wiped out by defectors on their own .",
    "thus , as soon as defectors die out , the evolution of the remaining cooperative strategies become neutral and proceeds by means of coarsening that is characteristic for the voter - model - type dynamics @xcite . by determining the fixation probabilities in dependence on the synergy factor @xmath21",
    ", we have shown that in the low @xmath21 limit the fixation at @xmath15 ( the most cautious conditional cooperators ) is practically unavoidable , while in the high @xmath21 limit all five cooperative strategies ( @xmath52 ) become equally probable to emerge as the dominant trait .",
    "regardless of @xmath21 , however , the defectors are unable to survive the evolutionary process , which is a very rewarding discovery to arrive at simply by means of a conditional strategy ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "conceptually at least , our approach can be related to a recent study by vukov et al .",
    "@xcite , where directed investments were introduced to the public goods game . in their model , however , a cooperator will necessarily invest somewhere , while in our case cooperators may remain dormant for long periods of time before eventually deciding to contribute to the common pool . in terms of potential implication of our findings , apart from their relevance for the successful evolution of prosocial behavior between selfish and unrelated individuals , from the biological point of view , the way inactive cooperators quarantine defectors and force them into convex isolated `` bubbles '' bears resemblance to the way the immune system works when trying to contain an infection @xcite .",
    "we hope that this study will inspire future research aimed at investigating the role of conditional strategies in structured populations ."
