    "massless two - dimensional ( 2d ) dirac fermions are of central importance in several condensed matter applications of current interest , in particular for monolayer graphene@xcite and for the surface state of a 3d strong topological insulator ( ti).@xcite these systems offer readily accessible table - top realizations of relativistic quantum physics , where electron - electron interactions are typically much stronger than in atomic physics .",
    "interactions are characterized by an effective fine structure constant @xmath1 , where for graphene @xmath5 to @xmath6 depending on experimental details,@xcite while in tis @xmath1 is probably somewhat smaller due to the large dielectric constant of the relevant thermoelectric materials ( for instance , bi@xmath7se@xmath8 or bi@xmath7te@xmath8).@xcite we here study the problem of @xmath0 massless 2d dirac quasi - particles confined to a circular quantum dot of radius @xmath9 and interacting through the coulomb potential ( with prefactor @xmath10 ) .",
    "quantum dots formed in 2d semiconductor heterostructures have been studied in much detail over the past two decades , both experimentally@xcite and theoretically.@xcite given the exceptional properties of dirac fermions and the unique properties of the underlying materials , it is of considerable practical and fundamental interest to investigate dirac fermion quantum dots .",
    "since the commonly employed electrostatic gating@xcite is problematic due to the ( recently observed@xcite ) klein tunneling phenomenon , the question of how to confine dirac fermions in a controlled manner arises .",
    "while quasi - bound states induced by electrostatic potentials have also been studied,@xcite we here consider two types of _ stable _ confinement : ( i ) an infinite - mass boundary condition@xcite on the single - particle wavefunction at @xmath11 , and ( ii ) confinement by a spatially inhomogeneous magnetic field profile.@xcite graphene dots have already been investigated experimentally by several groups,@xcite where confinement was so far created lithographically .",
    "while this ( approximately ) corresponds to case ( i ) above , such a procedure may give rise to uncontrolled disorder effects along the boundary , and route ( ii ) may offer a promising alternative for future experiments , see also ref .  .",
    "for the ti surface state , we are not aware of experimental reports of quantum dot physics , but confinement should be achievable as well using , e.g. , suitably arranged close - by ferromagnetic layers .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "another difficulty arises from the dirac nature of the quasi - particles when one attempts to include electron - electron interactions . for the @xmath0-particle problem , where a first - quantized formulation generally offers the most natural route,@xcite the problem arises from the unboundedness of the single - particle dirac hamiltonian in eq .",
    "this causes the brown - ravenhall@xcite `` disease : ''",
    "the unbounded spectrum allows particles to lose arbitrary amounts of energy by transferring their energy in ( real ) scattering events to other particles . to circumvent this problem ,",
    "suppose that the chemical potential is located just above the dirac point .",
    "we then follow sucher@xcite and confine the hilbert space to positive - energy eigenstates of the full single - particle problem , i.e. , we assume an inert filled dirac sea .",
    "this projection approach has been successfully employed in the same context before,@xcite and one can analyze also other values for the chemical potential .",
    "the accuracy of this method was carefully assessed in ref .  .",
    "in short , the presence of a spectral gap due to confinement allows to implement sucher s no - pair approximation@xcite since electron - hole pair excitations neglected in this approach have to overcome the gap .",
    "below we show and compare results from three different computational approaches .",
    "in particular , we perform self - consistent hartree - fock ( hf ) calculations and , in addition , study a similar self - consistent variational procedure using the so - called mller density matrix functional ( replacing the fock term).@xcite in atomic physics applications , the mller functional is sometimes superior to the hf approach and is valuable because it yields a _ lower _ bound for the ground - state energy.@xcite we note that hf calculations for graphene dots with infinite - mass confinement have also been carried out by other groups.@xcite while the hf approximation is known to provide an upper bound for the exact ( within sucher s projection approach ) ground - state energy,@xcite the mller functional is again expected to generate a variational lower bound .",
    "we will compare results from those two approaches to exact diagonalization computations for @xmath2 interacting dirac quasi - particles .",
    "the model and those three numerical approaches are described in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , while the comparison for @xmath2 can be found in sec .",
    "as expected , the exact results are always bracketed by the results obtained from the mller functional and under the hf approximation . however , within the range @xmath12 studied in this work , we find that the hf results are much closer to the exact results and provide a rather accurate approximation .",
    "however , results based on the mller functional show an unphysical divergence when @xmath4 , and are less accurate than the hf results for small @xmath1 .",
    "( of course , for @xmath13 , all three methods recover the correct noninteracting results . )",
    "having established the hf approach as highly accurate approach for @xmath12 and @xmath2 , we continue in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] with a presentation of hf results for @xmath14 dirac particles in a quantum dot with infinite - mass confinement . besides the ground - state energy ,",
    "we study various physical observables like the particle density or the spin density .",
    "our results suggest that in a confined geometry dirac particles can form a `` wigner molecule '' as previously discussed for schrdinger particles in semiconductor dots.@xcite when the coulomb interactions dominate over the kinetic energy , a wigner crystal can be formed where electrons spontaneously order in a crystalline structure .",
    "the presence of a confining potential makes this wigner crystallization more favorable,@xcite and although no wigner crystal is expected for bulk graphene,@xcite we find that the confined geometry allows for a finite - size wigner `` molecule '' even for dirac fermions .",
    "the paper concludes with a discussion in sec .",
    "in this section we discuss the model studied in this work , and address the different calculational schemes employed to study the @xmath0-particle problem for interacting dirac fermions in a quantum dot .",
    "we consider a single species of massless 2d dirac fermions described by the single - particle hamiltonian ( @xmath15 is the electron charge ) @xmath16 where @xmath17 and the pauli matrices @xmath18 refer to the sublattice structure of the honeycomb lattice for graphene@xcite or to the electronic spin degree of freedom for the ti surface state.@xcite the fermi velocity in graphene is @xmath19  m@xmath20s , while the corresponding value for the ti surface state is approximately half this value . a single dirac cone as in eq .",

    "in order to form a quantum dot , where dirac fermions are confined to a bounded spatial region , say , a disk of radius @xmath9 around the origin , we now consider the two possibilities mentioned in sec .",

    "the eigenenergies for this single - particle problem can be found numerically and were given in ref .  .",
    "the spectrum contains `` dot states '' , with probability density concentrated in the disk region @xmath37 , plus relativistic bulk landau states for @xmath55 .",
    "the landau states are weakly perturbed by the presence of the dimensionless `` missing flux '' parameter @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the magnetic length . because of this perturbation , landau level energies are slightly shifted away from their standard bulk value , but dot states can be clearly distinguished in the single - particle spectrum . with",

    "the @xmath0-particle problem can then be studied for @xmath64 only .",
    "in fact , due to the repulsive interactions , the maximum number of bound electrons may be lowered even further.@xcite for the infinite - mass confinement [ case ( i ) ] , there is no constraint on the number of particles held by the dot .",

    "we obtain @xmath77 equation is then evaluated by numerical integration routines and yields the interaction matrix elements .",
    "next , we briefly describe three different numerical approaches to obtain the ground - state energy for a quantum dot containing @xmath0 dirac fermions , namely hf simulations , the mller density matrix formulation , and exact diagonalization ( for @xmath2 ) . in order to have a well - defined many - body problem , we follow sucher@xcite and restrict ourselves to the projected single - particle space , i.e.",

    "failure to converge indicates an instability of the method , as we will see in the case of the mller functional for strong interactions .",

    "finally , the exact numerical diagonalization of the full many - body problem is only possible for small particle numbers due to the exponential increase in computational complexity with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "we have therefore carried out exact diagonalization calculations only for @xmath2 dirac fermions , primarily to check the accuracy of the two computationally less expensive but approximate alternative approaches .",

    ".  , correcting an earlier attempt@xcite ) @xmath90 although this critical value was derived for the case of vanishing magnetic field , we anticipate that it applies also to the confined geometry , with or without magnetic field , since it arises from the fact that both the kinetic energy and the coulomb singularity scale as inverse length for short distances , i.e. , a regular magnetic field is clearly irrelevant for the singular behavior .",
    "( such a result has recently been established in a related situation.@xcite ) for @xmath91 , the exchange part in the mller functional [ eq .
