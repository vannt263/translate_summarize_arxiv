    "in recent years , there has been substantial interest in models in condensed matter physics with symmetry groups larger than su(2 ) , the group underlying the usual spin algebra . in particular ,",
    "transition - metal oxides  @xcite , where the electron spin is coupled to orbital degrees of freedom , have been described theoretically by models with su(4 ) symmetry  @xcite . furthermore , there has been a growing interest in the su(@xmath2 ) generalization of the hubbard model  @xcite motivated by possible experimental realizations in systems of ultracold atoms  @xcite .    in a previous paper  @xcite",
    ", we have used the su(@xmath2 ) haldane  shastry model to make the case that the elementary excitations of su(@xmath2 ) spin chains transform under the representation _ conjugate _ to the representation of the su(@xmath2 ) spins on the chain , and only exist in one n@xmath3 of the brillouin zone . in this article , we will present for one thing the detailed calculations underlying our line of argumentation in  @xcite . to this end , we focus on the su(3 ) haldane  shastry model ( hsm )  @xcite , which serves as a paradigm for not only the su(3 ) spin chain , but , as we shall see , also illustrates some very general properties of su(@xmath2 ) chains .",
    "in particular , we derive the quantum numbers of the elementary , fractionally quantized excitations , the analogs of the spinon excitations for su(2 ) , which we call colorons for su(3 ) .",
    "as already mentioned , the key result is that these excitations transform under the su(@xmath2 ) representation conjugate to the representation of the original su(@xmath2 ) spins localized at the sites of the chain . in the case of su(3 ) , if a basis for the original spins is spanned by the colors blue , red , and green , a basis for the coloron excitations is given by the complementary colors yellow , cyan , and magenta ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : reps ] ) .",
    "this result is meaningless for su(2 ) , as the representations of su(2 ) are self - conjugate , but significant in all other instances of fractional quantization in su(@xmath2 ) chains and possible higher dimensional liquids , regardless of model specifics . in our analysis , however , we will primarily focus on the su(3 ) hsm , as this is the simplest model in which this general result can be illustrated through exact calculations , and only afterwards generalize our results to the case of su(@xmath2 ) .",
    "the other significant advancement we report here is the construction of the exact , color - polarized two - coloron eigenstates .",
    "we obtain those through derivation and solution of a sutherland - type equation which is similar to the case of two spinons in the su(2 ) hsm .",
    "our explicit calculation implies that the colorons are , just like the spinons , non - interacting or free , but that the spacings in the difference of the individual coloron momenta @xmath4 and @xmath5 with @xmath6 are given by @xmath7 .",
    "we will argue that this spacing is a direct manifestation of the fractional statistics  @xcite of the colorons with statistical exclusion parameter @xmath1 .",
    "this value is consistent with what we find by naive state counting .",
    "we then proceed by calculating the su(3 ) spin currents , the eigenvalues of the diagonal components of the rapidity operator @xmath8 and @xmath9 , for the one- and two - coloron states .",
    "thereafter , we interpret our results within the framework of the asymptotic bethe ansatz .",
    "finally , we generalize some of our conclusions to the case of su(@xmath2 ) .",
