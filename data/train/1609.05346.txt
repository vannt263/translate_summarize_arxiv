    "solar energetic particles ( seps ) can be accelerated either at coronal mass ejection ( cme ) driven shocks in gradual large sep ( lsep ) events or by processes related to magnetic reconnection at the flare sites in impulsive or @xmath0he - rich sep events ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "anomalous elemental composition in impulsive sep events , extremely different from coronal abundances , has not been so far sufficiently explained ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "in addition to a preferential acceleration by resonant interactions with mhd turbulence ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , other non - wave mechanisms have been proposed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast to lsep events , @xmath0he - rich sep events have lower ion intensities and energies , shorter durations and are associated with minor x - ray flares .",
    "though they are numerous these features make them a less explored phenomenon .",
    "solar sources of @xmath0he - rich seps have been often associated with coronal x - ray and euv jets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which sometimes show a high altitude extension in jet - like cmes @xcite .",
    "jets have been considered to be a signature of magnetic reconnection involving open field ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "predominantly narrow cmes in these events have been also reported by @xcite .",
    "recently , new observations from the _ solar dynamics observatory _ ( sdo ) and _ solar terrestrial relations observatory _ ( stereo ) have revealed a few @xmath0he - rich sep events associated with large - scale coronal euv waves @xcite .",
    "this finding appears to be surprising in view of previous associations with narrow flare signatures .",
    "four of the reported @xmath0he - rich sep events with a coronal wave were accompanied by slow ( @xmath1300kms@xmath2 ) cmes @xcite but two others were without a cme @xcite .",
    "coronal waves have been so far reported in lsep events in association with fast and wide cmes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "however , there is still some controversy on the nature of coronal waves ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . presently , it is believed they are true magnetosonic waves and not just coronal magnetic field reconfigurations induced by a cme .",
    "indeed , a recent report on euv waves associated with x - ray flares alone @xcite appears to be consistent with the true wave concept .    the aim of this paper is to examine how common an association of @xmath0he - rich seps with large - scale coronal waves is without setting any restriction criteria on the selection of the events . for this purpose",
    "we collect 32 @xmath0he - rich sep events within the solar activity minimum period 20072010 to avoid source confusion in the more active periods .",
    "we identify solar sources of @xmath0he - rich seps using new viewing perspectives from angularly separated spacecraft .",
    "these observations are presented in section [ sec : rad ] . in section [ sec : con ] we discuss possible implications of associated coronal waves on energetic ion characteristics in these events .",
    "table 1 lists 32 @xmath0he - rich sep events observed near the earth at the l1 point with the _ advanced composition explorer _ ( ace ) between january 2007 and december 2010 .",
    "we have selected all detectable events by examining he mass spectrograms of low - energy ( 0.21mevnucleon@xmath2 ) ions from the ultra low energy isotope spectrometer ( uleis ; * ? ? ? * ) and of high - energy ( 4.516.3mevnucleon@xmath2 ) ions from the solar isotope spectrometer ( sis ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) including the events near the detection threshold reported in the previous studies @xcite .",
    "the uleis is a high - resolution time - of - flight mass spectrometer which measures ions from he to ni in the energy range from 20kevnucleon@xmath2 to several mevnucleon@xmath2 .",
    "the sis is a @xmath3 versus residual energy telescope measuring he to zn nuclei from @xmath410 to @xmath4100mevnucleon@xmath2 range .",
    "only 1/4 of all examined events showed a clear signature of @xmath0he at the highest examined energy range of 7.616.3mevnucleon@xmath2 .",
    "the high - energy @xmath0he - rich seps are relatively rare events @xcite and it is not clear if they require an additional acceleration process @xcite .",

    "though there was only one ar ( ar1040 ) on the solar disk as observed from the two widely separated ( 134@xmath12 ) stereos the source identification is not obvious . since the event started at the beginning of january 16 , the ion injection would be expected around the end of previous day .",
