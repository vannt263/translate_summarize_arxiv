    "the laser has been a critical enabler of the modern discipline of quantum optics via its highly monochromatic and intense emission properties .",
    "the physical understanding of steady - state laser emission has presented challenges since the early days after its invention , as first semiclassical @xcite and then fully quantum laser theories were developed @xcite .",
    "although these theories were able to capture most of the relevant physics , they tended to incorporate some phenomenological or approximate steps due to the complexity of dealing with the full non - linear and space - dependent semiclassical or quantum laser equations . over forty years ago , several pioneers of early laser theory , lang , scully and lamb , addressed some of the weak points in the theory in a classic paper entitled,``why is the laser line so narrow ?  a theory of single quasi - mode laser operation '' @xcite .",
    "this work was aimed at a fundamental challenge in laser theory , dealing with the openness of the laser system , which invalidated standard hermitian modal decompositions appropriate for closed systems . prior to this work",
    "essentially all theories were framed in terms of `` quasi - modes '' of the type studied by fox and li and were based on phenomenological modal equations with cavity damping inserted to represent the outcoupling of the modes @xcite .",
    "the goal of lang _",
    "et al . _",
    "was to go beyond these quasi - mode equations for the laser field amplitudes to a more fundamental description which included both the cavity and exterior regions explicitly ( i.e.  a model of `` the universe '' ) , and then work back from the modes of the universe to the quasi - modes of the cavity region alone . using this approach the authors ( 1 ) `` hope[d ] to understand the mechanism leading to the extreme monochromaticity of the laser radiation '' , and ( 2 ) `` to investigate the sense in which the present calculation , which does not include the cavity dissipation as a phenomological loss mechanism , still leads to and implies a fluctuation - dissipation theorem '' @xcite .",
    "while this approach to understanding the laser equations was groundbreaking at the time , there has been much progress in laser theory in the subsequent years and it seemed to us a good time to re - examine these questions from a modern perspective .",
    "one reason for this is that during the past decade a new theoretical framework has been developed , known as the steady - state _ ab initio _ laser theory ( salt ) , which treats the openness of an arbitrary cavity exactly within the semiclassical theory @xcite , and thus has provided new insights into lasing phenomena .",
    "the resulting non - linear salt equations for steady - state lasing can be solved efficiently using a non - hermitian basis set method and have been shown to agree to very high accuracy with brute force simulations of the atomic lasing equations @xcite , including even n - level models with multiple independent lasing transitions @xcite .",
    "the theory can also be generalized to treat injected signals ( i - salt ) , as will be relevant below @xcite . moreover , recently pick _",
    "_  have added langevin noise to the salt equations ( n - salt ) and , using the salt steady - state lasing modes as a starting point , calculated the quantum - limited laser linewidth analytically @xcite .",
    "their analytic results have very recently been confirmed , again by direct simulations of the lasing equations , but with appropriate noise terms included @xcite .",
    "it should be said that many aspects of the results obtained through salt and n - salt were anticipated by prior theoretical approaches , a partial list of which includes the work by spencer and lamb @xcite , fu and haken @xcite , and henry @xcite ; however salt and n - salt appear to be the most general , flexible and inclusive formalism yet developed for steady - state lasing .",
    "it treats the fields over the entire `` universe '' from the outset , but in a different manner from lang _",
    "et al . _ , and does not arrive at modal equations with damping in the conventional sense .",
    "we will now examine the questions raised by lang _",
    "et al . _",
    "from the perspective of salt and n - salt .",
    "most early lasers emitted from lasing modes which were concentrated along some optical axis , e.g.  the axis joining the centers of two mirrors or the geometric or index profile defining a waveguide or fiber , and so there was a tendency to develop laser theories focused on one - dimensional or axially symmetric equations , and this is overwhelmingly the type of formulation one finds in text books @xcite . however in the past two decades a great variety of laser systems have been developed with complex two or three - dimensional cavities , such as microdisks and microspheres @xcite , micro - toroids @xcite , deformed ( chaotic ) disk cavities @xcite , photonic crystal defect - based and surface emitting lasers @xcite and random lasers @xcite .",
    "to describe such devices it was necessary to formulate laser theory in a manner that could both describe , and be implemented computationally , for cavities with an arbitrary geometry , and to include the full maxwell wave equation , not its axial approximation .",
    "moreover , some of the new lasers ( e.g.  random lasers ) are extremely open systems , not even cavities in the usual sense ; nor do they always emit well - behaved narrow beams of light but rather generate complex emission patterns in two and three dimensions . thus it was crucial to find a description which did not over - simplify the spatial properties of the cavities and emission patterns , and which hence treated the cavity boundary and outcoupling exactly .",
    "the solution to this challenge provided by salt is to describe the laser as a scattering system .",
    "any laser consists of two essential elements : a cavity region , given as a linear dielectric function , @xmath0 , which describes the scattering and confinement of photons , either injected externally or internally generated , and a gain region , containing the medium which will be pumped to provide optical gain ( sometimes cavity and gain medium essentially coincide ) . to include all cases",
    "the `` cavity '' will refer simply to a singly connected region large enough to enclose all the regions in which @xmath1 ; and for simplicity we will assume the gain medium is fully contained within this region as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : cavity ] .     and a non - linear gain region .",
    "any incoming signals ( blue arrows ) are amplified and scattered by the cavity to outgoing states ( red arrows ) ; lasing corresponds to outgoing solutions without any input , and is only possible at discrete frequencies for a given cavity [ fig : cavity],scaledwidth=30.0% ]    the laser so defined can function both as an amplifier of input radiation ( when the gain medium is inverted ) and as a self - organized oscillator / source of radiation in the absence of input , above the first threshold for lasing . from this point of view",
    "the laser is a scattering system which both scatters and amplifies input radiation , and also , at discrete frequencies , scatters specific internally generated modes of outgoing radiation when sufficiently pumped .",
    "however unlike linear scattering systems , the laser is subject to non - linear saturation effects which are fundamental to its stability and must be taken into account .",
    "other non - linear effects within lasers , such as four - wave mixing , can destabilize their simple harmonic time - response , but these effects are neglected in salt , and also ( typically ) in the earlier laser theories which motivated the work by lang _",
    "et al_.  @xcite . leaving out such effects",
    "is equivalent to assuming a stationary inversion density , giving rise to a gain susceptibility which does not mix frequencies .",
    "this assumption is always valid for single - mode lasing and amplification , which will be the focus of this work ; it is also valid under certain rather general conditions for multimode lasing in microlasers , and salt has been shown to apply quantitatively to such cases @xcite .    before proceeding",
    ", it should be mentioned that the input / output theory developed by collett and gardiner ( and others ) also considers the cavity to be a scattering element @xcite and is able to treat the full quantum operator properties of the scattered fields .",
    "this approach has certainly contributed to our understanding of open quantum systems and the role played by the reservoirs and noise processes . however , while there has been substantial effort expended to describe lasing within this framework @xcite , it remains an open problem how to include the strong non - linearities present in active lasing systems in this formalism ; whereas at the semiclassical level this is done quite accurately by salt .",
    "initially we focus on the single - mode lasing case , as was done by lang _",
    "_ , so that the positive frequency component of the electric field will be given by : @xmath2 where the _ real _ number , @xmath3 , is either the input radiation frequency ( for the amplifier ) or the unknown frequency of the laser oscillator , which must be self - consistently determined .",
    "@xmath4 is the unknown spatial lasing ( or amplified ) mode , not assumed to be equal to any passive cavity mode or quasi - mode and is also self - consistently determined ; such lasing / amplifier modes _ describe the solution over all space _ , not just inside the cavity .    assuming stationary inversion and neglecting quantum and thermal fluctuations",
    ", we can describe @xmath5 for an arbitrary laser by a non - linear wave equation of the form : @xmath6 { \\bf \\psi } ( { \\mathbf{x } } ) = 0 , \\label{eq : maxwave}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the complex , frequency - dependent saturable gain susceptibility , which can be calculated for an arbitrary n - level atomic gain medium in steady - state @xcite . for the case of a two - level gain medium",
    "it takes the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the pump parameter ( proportional to the inversion ) , @xmath11 is the dephasing rate of the polarization , @xmath12 is the atomic resonance frequency , and @xmath13 is a lorentzian centered at @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath14 are measured here in appropriate dimensionless units @xcite , and this form assumes that there is only one mode , either lasing or amplified , active in the medium .",
    "( this is the only case we will consider explicitly here , but we will review the more general multimode salt formalism in appendix [ app : salt ] ) .",
    "the non - linear gain susceptibility represents the polarization of the gain medium and is the source of the amplification and ( above threshold ) of laser emission . the lack of any langevin force terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : maxwave ] ) is a result of the semiclassical approximation , in which the operators for the electromagnetic and polarization fields are replaced by their average values , eliminating the effects of quantum and thermal fluctuations .",
    "such terms are taken into account in n - salt , which will be discussed briefly in sec .",
    "[ sec : noise ] , but were neglected ( intentionally ) in the work of lang _",
    "et al . _",
    "assuming the system is pumped below the first lasing threshold and the inputs are small enough to generate negligible saturation of the gain , this equation defines a linear non - unitary scattering ( s-)matrix for input fields . depending upon the geometry",
    "there are different natural basis states describing input and output modes , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , from and to infinity , i.e.  sufficiently far away from the cavity region , @xmath17   \\\\ = & \\sum_{\\alpha , \\beta }   [ c_\\alpha ( { \\bf h}_{\\alpha}^{(-)}({\\mathbf{x } } ) + s_{\\alpha,\\beta } { \\bf h}_{\\beta}^{(+)}({\\mathbf{x}}))]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    if the pump is strong enough to invert the medium and create gain at the input frequency , the s - matrix will be amplifying , with eigenvalues greater than unity . when functioning as an amplifier the boundary conditions are familiar : an input wave from infinity interacts with the cavity plus gain medium , scattering according to the appropriate dielectric or metallic boundary conditions in different regions of the cavity and giving rise to an outgoing wave which differs from passive scattering in that it is amplified and more photon flux emerges from the scattering region than enters it .",
    "the case of large inputs leading to a saturated gain and the resulting non - linear s - matrix can be handled by i - salt and will be included in the discussion below .",
    "as noted , in this formulation there is no distinction between cavity modes and modes of the universe , every amplified mode exists inside and outside the cavity as a steady - state scattering solution .",
    "however we now consider to the more challenging and subtle case of laser oscillation in the scattering picture .",
    "any scattering region of finite extent with a real potential or dielectric function , and hence with a unitary s - matrix , will have associated with it resonant solutions ; i.e.  stationary solutions at discrete complex frequencies which are purely outgoing .",
    "it is easiest to think of these as evolving out of the bound states of the system at real frequencies , @xmath18 , which would occur if the region were surrounded by a perfect lossless reflecting barrier . as the reflectivity of the fictitious barrier",
    "is reduced from unity to zero these real frequency solutions , corresponding to standing waves , evolve into complex frequency solutions with a substantial outgoing wave component ( and no incoming wave from infinity ) . due to the purely outgoing boundary conditions",
    "it can be shown that the imaginary part of the frequency must be negative , and the s - matrix , continued to complex frequencies , will become infinite with simple poles at @xmath19 . hence these purely outgoing solutions are discrete and countably infinite , in one to one correspondence with the bound states of the closed cavity .    in the asymptotic region",
    "the frequency and wavevector of the solutions are linked by the dispersion relation and the sign of @xmath20 will cause the corresponding spatial solution to grow exponentially at infinity and carry a diverging outgoing photon flux .",
    "hence these solutions are not physically realizable , but have physical significance because the s - matrix will have a resonant response near the real values @xmath21 , with a bandwidth given by @xmath20 ( assuming well - separated high finesse resonances ) .",
    "the corresponding spatial solutions are referred to by various terms : quasi - modes , quasi - bound states and resonances .",
    "historically the use of multiple terms seems to have arisen from the transition from 3d confinement , as e.g.  in a microwave resonator , where the connection to bound states is more apparent , to open , axial mirror - based resonators , where the resonances perpendicular to the mirror axis are essentially absent , and the fox - li method was developed to determine the high @xmath22 resonances .",
    "however there is no fundamental difference between the various types of outgoing solutions : they all correspond to poles of the passive cavity s - matrix .",
    "such states also are very well - known from quantum scattering theory ( where they are usually referred to as quasi - bound states ) , and are often considered to be physical states because if an initial condition is given corresponding to the quasi - bound state truncated to the `` cavity region '' , it will leak out to infinity with a rate given by @xmath20 ( this property was explicitly demonstrated for the one - dimensional cavity treated by lang _",
    "et al . _ ) .",
    "however in this context we would like to emphasize that the true quasi - bound states , including the exponentially growing component at infinity , are not physically realizable steady - state solutions and can not correspond to the lasing mode .",
    "also , since they occur at the poles of the s - matrix for the passive cavity , they can only describe the properties of the passive cavity , independent of the gain medium and spectrum . thus using `` quasi - mode '' also as a term for the lasing mode in the presence of gain can , and in our view often has , led to confusion .",
    "however , as described above , the properties of the laser / amplifier are not governed by a unitary s - matrix once the complex gain susceptibility is taken into account .",
    "this complex susceptibility violates the hermiticity of the wave equation even for the closed cavity and invalidates the standard modal decomposition .",
    "but it makes possible purely outgoing solutions at real frequencies , which hence are physical solutions over all of space .",
    "the non - equilibrium steady - state gain susceptibility depends on the pump level , with its imaginary part changing sign from positive ( absorbing ) to negative ( amplifying ) at the transparency point , at which the upper and lower lasing levels are equally occupied and the susceptibility vanishes . at this pump value",
    "the poles of the cavity with gain coincide again with those of the passive cavity . as the pump",
    "is increased beyond the transparency point , all of the passive cavity poles continue to exist , but typically they move up in the complex plane towards the real axis @xcite , at a rate that depends on their position in the gain spectrum . the s - matrix of the amplifier can be measured for real frequencies as the pump increases , and the height of the resonances corresponding to each pole increases ( the transmitted flux is greater than the incident flux due to amplification ) , while their width decreases ( gain narrowing ) , because the effective loss rate is proportional to the imaginary part of the pole frequency , which is decreasing .",
    "if there is no input to the amplifier then there is still no emitted field and no indication within semiclassical theory of the approach to lasing ( although when quantum fluctuations are included there will be enhanced noise , amplified spontaneous emission ( ase ) , near the gain center ) .",
    "if lasing is achieved , one of the poles of the s - matrix reaches the real axis , gain completely balances loss , and we have a zero width resonance on the real axis .",
    "this process is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : poles ] for a non - trivial two - dimensional cavity , a chaotic  d - shaped \" dielectric cavity @xcite , where each pole is seen to move towards the real axis an amount proportional its distance from the center of the gain curve and one of the poles experiences enough gain to reach threshold .    , @xmath23 , @xmath24 as shown in the bottom schematic , with a uniform two - level atomic gain medium characterized by @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "( top ) plot of the lorentzian gain profile for the atomic medium .",
    "( bottom ) plot of the motion of the poles of the s - matrix as the d - shaped cavity is pumped to the first lasing threshold .",
    "the pole corresponding to the first lasing mode is seen to reach the real axis ( marked with a red circle ) , and the spatial profile of the lasing mode at threshold is shown just above . [",
    "fig : poles],scaledwidth=48.0% ]    it first may seem that we are back at the familiar situation of true bound states , which correspond to poles on the real axis , but this is not so . in the former case",
    "there is no photon gain and one simply has a decaying standing wave pattern , trapped in some region of space .",
    "here we have a different type of object , which we call a `` threshold lasing mode '' ( tlm ) .",
    "this type of solution never occurs in hermitian theories , a purely outgoing solution at real frequency ; it reflects the fundamentally non - hermitian nature of the electromagnetic wave equations with a complex susceptibility , which is an effective theory in which the matter degrees of freedom are hidden .",
    "such a solution is characterized by a steady - state photon flux out to infinity , but with no unphysical growth of intensity _ outside _ the cavity and an emission pattern corresponding to the eigenvector of the s - matrix with a diverging eigenvalue .",
    "it is an example of a constant flux ( cf ) state : photons are generated within the cavity but are conserved outside the cavity , hence corresponding to a true physical lasing solution @xcite . in appendix [ app :",
    "salt ] we will show that each tlm is just one member of a complete biorthogonal basis set of cf states which forms a natural basis set for describing the non - linear lasing solution above threshold",
    ". however we still have a conceptual problem : the linear s - matrix for this amplifier is now infinite at the lasing frequency .",
    "within linear theory any input would be infinitely amplified , violating conservation of energy .",
    "the resolution of this dilemma is that infinitesimally above threshold the saturating non - linearity kicks in and stabilizes the solution .",
    "in fact the steady - state lasing amplitude rises smoothly from zero and has no jump at threshold , just a discontinuous derivative .",
    "even though formally the s - matrix has a pole fixed on the real axis above threshold , any input wave at the lasing frequency simply increases the gain saturation and does nt lead to a runaway of the output . strictly speaking , any such input actually forces the pole off the real axis , as we will show with an example in sec .",
    "[ sec : example ] .",
    "hence the non - linearity is essential for stablizing the linear cf solution .",
    "however , the actual solution near threshold is accurately described by the single tlm calculated from the linear wave equation with gain , since the saturation term is not strong enough to change the spatial form of the solution significantly .",
    "returning to the fundamental question of modes of the universe vs. quasi - modes of the cavity , we summarize the salt perspective .    * if one treats lasers as unbounded scattering systems from the outset , all solutions are defined both inside and outside the cavity region and there is no distinction between cavity modes and modes of the universe . *",
    "if the laser is functioning as an amplifier , the solutions are simply amplified scattering states determined by the boundary conditions in the cavity region and the degree of gain at the input frequency .",
    "* if the laser is functioning as a self - organized oscillator the solutions are purely outgoing states corresponding to an eigenvector of the linear scattering matrix with diverging eigenvalue due to the existence of a pole on the real axis .",
    "such solutions require the presence of the saturating non - linearity to be physically stable .",
    "* for any given cavity and gain susceptibility such purely outgoing states can only occur at discrete frequencies because they arise from moving the discrete poles of the passive cavity onto the real axis .",
    "within semiclassical theory ( neglecting quantum and thermal fluctuations of the fields ) these solutions have precisely zero linewidth .",
    "we reserve the term `` lasing mode '' for these special discrete solutions . in summary then , our response to the question `` why is the laser linewidth so narrow ? ''",
    "is that indeed this _ is _ due to the extreme limit of gain narrowing : only at discrete frequencies can the linear gain diverge and generate self - organized oscillation . as we will show in the next section",
    ", this zero - width resonance can not be observed with an input signal , i.e.  in amplification mode .",
    "however these perfectly monochromatic purely outgoing solutions can be found by salt and have been verified by brute force fdtd simulations of the laser equations for many examples @xcite",
    ". such infinitely sharp lines are not of course obervable in true laser emission due to quantum fluctuations as we will discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec : noise ] .",
    "however the smallness of these quantum effects lead to the extraordinary narrowness of the resulting lines , often many orders of magnitude narrower than the passive cavity resonance linewidths .",
    "the effects of quantum fluctuations were intentionally not included in the work of lang _",
    "et al . _ , who thus also found a delta function laser line within semiclassical theory . in their approach",
    "they find that this extreme narrowing of the passive cavity resonance can be regarded as a `` mode - locking effect '' in which all of the modes of the universe within the passive cavity resonance linewidth contribute to one lasing quasi - mode with a single frequency .",
    "this point of view emerges from a limiting procedure in which a finite system with quantized electromagnetic modes is studied and at the end the system size is taken to infinity in the presence of small fictitious absorption to damp out reflections from the boundaries as they tend to infinity .",
    "the conditions for this procedure to reproduce the correct infinite system behavior are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : modes ] below .",
    "we note that lang _",
    "et al . _  expressed dissatisfaction with invoking gain narrowing to explain the laser linewidth , because in their view such arguments ( at the time ) did not take into account the non - linearity of the problem .",
    "however the conceptual framework of salt / i - salt , outlined here , _ does _ take non - linearity into account , essentially exactly , for single - mode lasing .",
    "we will now illustrate the previous concepts with a concrete one - dimensional example , very similar to the one studied by lang _",
    "_ , in the process making all of our statements above mathematically precise .",
    "the example studied by lang _ et al . _  was a one - dimensional cavity of length @xmath27 , with perfectly reflecting mirrors at @xmath28 and a partially reflecting delta function mirror at @xmath29 , as shown in fig .",

    "for such a system the passive cavity will have a reflection coefficient of modulus unity at all frequencies , and resonant reflection will be distinguished only by a long delay time in reflection and an associated build - up of field intensity in the cavity .",
    "we prefer to make a small modification of the lang _",

    "example and study a symmetric two sided partially transmitting ( fabry - perot ) cavity with laser emission to @xmath34 , and with passive cavity resonances distinguished by enhanced transmission , reaching unity at the center , and with width , @xmath35 . as with the lang _",

    "example , the electromagnetic part of the problem will be described by the scalar helmoltz equation with gain . however , unlike lang _",
    "et al . _ , no limiting procedure is applied ; our system is infinite from the start and no fictitious absorption is added to avoid reflections from perfect mirrors far away from the cavity . hence , consistent with our scattering approach , we start from continuous solutions for the passive cavity @xmath36 `` universe '' , and will impose outgoing boundary conditions at infinity on the lasing solutions .    , and",
    "as discussed below , this must be done by a particular limiting procedure in order to obtain the correct result for the laser .",

    "[ fig : passive ] we plot the transmitted intensity of an incident signal through the passive cavity at frequency @xmath37 .",

    "we first apply the lap to obtain the sommerfeld solution for this problem , taking the limit @xmath32 prior to @xmath75 . performing the limits in this order on the solution of @xmath80 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : uksol ] ) , one finds that to satisfy the dirichlet boundary condition , @xmath90 , we must choose @xmath91 , as the term multiplying this coefficient is diverging as @xmath92 for finite @xmath73 . then",

    "the spatial functions corresponding to the passive resonances are identical to the resonant solutions of the infinite system without damping _ inside the cavity _ , as there is no loss there , and the boundary condition at the mirror is the same . outside the mirror these solutions experience a damping not present in the infinite system and hence decay slowly as they propagate outwards . on the scale shown in the top panel of fig .",

    "finally , we can make contact with the salt approach by adding gain ( taken to be uniform for convenience ) in the cavity region while leaving the damping present outside the cavity . the added gain has a much bigger effect on the cavity resonance solutions which have high amplitude there , than on the external standing wave solutions . for large enough gain one of the cavity resonances can reach the real axis and",

    "the second and third terms stem from spontaneous emission events leading to the dephasing of the atomic polarization , and these terms depend on the parameters of the gain medium . for optical frequencies ,",

    "( [ eq : gcapprox ] ) obscures the fact that the physical origin of the noise is spontaneous emission in the gain medium .",

    "( [ eq : salt1 ] ) and ( [ eq : salt2 ] ) form the fundamental salt equations ( for the two level gain case ) : @xmath152 self - consistent , differential equations for the unknown spatial profiles of the @xmath152 modes in the electric field at n unknown frequencies , coupled through the non - linear spatial hole - burning in the inversion .",
    "these are to be solved with outgoing sommerfeld boundary conditions at infinity , which can only be satisfied at discrete frequencies .",
    "the salt equations also reveal the natural units for the electric field and atomic inversion , @xmath174 , and @xmath175 .",
    "the numerical solution of the salt equations is performed by expanding the mode profile functions over a basis , @xmath176 and then using a non - linear solver to find the expansion coefficients @xmath177 .",
    "there are two different basis sets that have been used to solve the salt equations .",
    "the first , and more developed , is based on a set of constant flux ( cf ) states @xcite , which are defined as @xmath178     \\mathbf{u}_n(\\mathbf{x } ; \\omega ) = 0 , \\label{eq : cfgen}\\ ] ] and satisfy the outgoing boundary condition at frequency @xmath3 at the surface of last scattering . here , @xmath179 and @xmath180 are the eigenvalue and eigenstates of the cf equation , and @xmath181 is the profile of the pump .",
    "a key aspect of the salt approach is that for any given frequency ( wavevector ) the cf states form a complete biorthogonal basis for an arbitrary purely outgoing solution ; hence they can expand any solution to the salt equations .",
    "moreover , by observing the similarities between eq .",
    "( [ eq : cfgen ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : salt1 ] ) , it is clear that just above the first lasing threshold where the spatial hole - burning in the inversion is negligible , the threshold lasing mode is given by a single cf basis state at the lasing frequency satisfying @xmath182 hence above threshold , the cf basis represents a numerically efficient basis for solving the salt equations , as each lasing mode can be represented by only a few cf states . the sommerfeld condition is implemented by matching conditions on the superposition at the last scattering surface to purely outgoing free hermitian solutions .",
    "the cf equation also facilitates solving the salt equations for amplified modes by yielding an additional basis , @xmath183 , @xmath184 , which are also defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : cfgen ] ) , but satisfy a purely incoming boundary condition instead , thus representing a signal with a constant flux into the cavity .",
    "recently an alternative approach for solving the salt equations has been developed , using a position space basis , and a truncated simulation region bordered by a perfectly matched layer @xcite .",
    "this follows the conceptual approach discussed in detail at the end of sec .",
    "[ sec : modes ] .",
    "the sommerfeld condition is not imposed by matching at a last scattering surface , but rather by the presence of the pml . in general , the cf methods allow for more elegant theoretical analysis , while the position space basis is ultimately expected to be more efficient computationally . in both approaches a non - linear iteration scheme will need to be implemented to find the correct self - consistent solution in the basis of choice .    the salt modal wave equation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : salt1 ] ) is satisfied by both lasing modes and injected signals , which interact and compete with each other for gain through the non - linear spatial hole - burning denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : salt2 ] ) .",
    "there are two major differences between lasing modes and injected signals though ; the former must satisfy the sommerfeld radiation condition , while the latter satisfies a mixed boundary condition with both incoming and outgoing terms . as a direct consequence of this ,",
    "the frequency of a lasing mode needs to be determined self - consistently from the outgoing boundary condition itself , while the frequency of an injected signal is externally fixed , and the mixed boundary condition can be satisfied at any frequency .",
    "traditionally , salt has been used to simulate semiconductor based microlasers , in which the optical confinement for one - dimensional systems is provided by fresnel reflection due to the dielectric mismatch across the cleaved facets of the device . however , for even the materials with the largest index of refraction , the optical confinement due to fresnel reflection is weak , @xmath185 for @xmath186 .",
    "thus to simulate high finesse systems , one must either introduce a geometric solution , such as a bragg reflector , or a partially reflecting mirror . in the results presented in sec .  [",
    "sec : example ] we chose to use a partially reflecting mirror , as we have the additional motivation of simulating a similar system as described by lang _",
    "_  and others @xcite . in this appendix",
    "we briefly detail how to implement a partially reflecting mirror in salt simulations .",
    ", into the passive , two - sided cavity with partially reflecting mirrors ( @xmath46 ) on both ends studied in fig .",
    "[ fig : passive ] .",
    "different colors represent different choices of resolution , @xmath187 ( red , orange , and green ) , or the analytic solution ( blue ) .",
    "[ fig : dx],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    mathematically , a partially reflecting mirror can be described by a delta function in the passive cavity dielectric function , @xmath188 where @xmath189 represents the strength of the @xmath190th mirror at @xmath191 . for a single mirror , it is straightforward to show that the reflection and transmission coefficients are @xmath192 which demonstrates that the figure of merit for the reflectivity of a partially reflecting mirror is @xmath193 .",
    "there are two different ways to implement this delta - function in salt , either by incorporating the partially reflecting mirrors directly into the passive cavity dielectric , as indicated above , or for mirrors at the cavity boundary , adjusting the outgoing boundary condition @xcite .",
    "the former method is numerically more stable , and is implemented in a discretized system as @xmath194 where @xmath195 is the kronecker delta , @xmath196 is the spatial position of the @xmath197th pixel in the system , and @xmath187 is the resolution . despite the fact that the reflectivity of such a mirror is dependent upon @xmath198 , when using the cf basis to solve the salt equations , one can choose @xmath199 to be a constant , and then adjust @xmath200 accordingly to achieve a system with reflectivity independent of the frequency , something which is not possible in time - domain simulation techniques .",
    "we can confirm that the discretized representation of a partially reflecting mirror used in conjunction with the salt algorithm is correct by comparing it against the analytic result . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dx ] we show the transmission resonance for the same passive cavity shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : passive ] when calculated analytically ( blue ) , and simulated using i - salt with increasing resolution ( red , orange , and green ) .",
    "the effect of discretizing the system is to shift the cavity resonances slightly , and as the resolution is increased , the location of the cavity resonance converges to the analytic value , as shown .",
    "however , regardless of the spatial resolution , the lorentzian shape of the cavity resonance remains unchanged .",

    "<S> we review and interpret a modern approach to laser theory , steady - state _ ab initio _ laser theory ( salt ) , which treats lasing and amplification in a unified manner as a non - unitary scattering problem described by a non - linear scattering matrix . within the semiclassical version of the theory the laser line has zero width as the lasing mode corresponds to the existence of an eigenvector of the s - matrix with diverging eigenvalue due to the occurrence of a pole of the scattering matrix on the real axis . in this approach </S>",
    "<S> the system is infinite from the outset and no distinction is made between cavity modes and modes of the universe ; lasing modes exist both in the cavity and in the external region as solutions satisfying sommerfeld radiation boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss how such solutions can be obtained by a limiting procedure in a finite box with damping according to the limiting absorption principle . </S>",
    "<S> when the electromagnetic and matter fields are treated as operators , quantum fluctuations enter the relevant correlation functions and a finite linewidth is obtained , via a generalization of salt to include noise ( n - salt ) . </S>",
    "<S> n - salt leads to an analytic formula for the linewidth that is more general than all previous corrected versions of the schawlow - townes formula , and can be evaluated simply from knowledge of the semiclassical salt modes . </S>",
    "<S> we derive a simpler version of this formula which emphasizes that the noise is dominated by the fluctuations in the polarization of the gain medium and is controlled by the rate of spontaneous emission . </S>"
