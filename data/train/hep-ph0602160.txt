    "thanks to the recent precise neutrino experiments , we now have robust evidences for the neutrino oscillation . the present neutrino experimental data @xcite indicate that the atmospheric neutrino deficit points toward a maximal mixing between the tau and muon neutrinos , however the solar neutrino deficit favors a not - so - maximal mixing between the electron and muon neutrinos .",
    "in addition , although we do not have yet any evidence for the neutrino oscillation arisen from the 1st and 3rd generation flavor mixing , there is a bound on the mixing element @xmath0 from chooz reactor experiment , @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "although neutrinos have gradually revealed their properties in various experiments since the historic super - kamiokande confirmation of neutrino oscillations @xcite , properties related to the leptonic cp violation are completely unknown yet . to understand in detail the neutrino mixings observed in various oscillation experiments",
    "is one of the most interesting puzzle in particle physics .",
    "the large value of @xmath5 and @xmath6 may be telling us about some new symmetries of leptons that are not present in the quark sector and may provide a clue to understanding the nature of quark - lepton physics beyond the standard model .",
    "recently , there have been some attempt to explain the maximal mixing of the atmospheric neutrinos and very tiny value of the 3rd mixing element @xmath0 by introducing some approximate discrete symmetries @xcite or the mass splitting among the heavy majorana neutrinos in the seesaw framework @xcite . in the basis",
    "where charged leptons are mass eigenstates , the @xmath1 interchange symmetry has become useful in understanding the maximal atmospheric neutrino mixing and the smallness of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the mass difference between the muon and the tau leptons , of course , breaks this symmetry in the basis .",
    "so we expect this symmetry to be an approximate one , and thus it must hold only for the neutrino sector at low energy .",
    "on the other hand , finding non - vanishing but small mixing element @xmath0 would be very interesting in the sense that the element is closely related to leptonic cp violation @xcite .",
    "if future neutrino experiments would measure the non - vanishing @xmath0 @xcite , it may indicate from the afore - mentioned point of view that the @xmath1 symmetry must be broken .",
    "motivated by this prospect , in this paper , we propose a scenario to break the @xmath1 symmetry so as to accommodate the non - vanishing @xmath0 .",
    "our scenario is constructed in the context of a seesaw model , and the symmetry breaking is first achieved by introducing a cp phase in the dirac yukawa matrix .",
    "then , the resultant effective light neutrino mass matrix generated through seesaw mechanism reflects the @xmath1 symmetry breaking , which is parameterized in terms of the cp phase . the @xmath1 symmetry should be recovered in the limit of vanishing cp phase .    in fact , the breaking of the @xmath1 symmetry through a cp phase has been also discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the authors have studied the breaking in the framework of the effective light neutrino mass matrix . in ref .",
    "@xcite the breaking has been also achieved through the heavy majorana neutrino mass matrix with complex elements , which is completely different from our scheme .",
    "we will study how neutrino mixings and the neutrino mass - squared difference can be predicted and show how the deviation of @xmath2 from the maximal mixing and non - vanishing @xmath0 depend on the cp phase in our scenario . the prediction for the amplitude in neutrinoless double beta decay will be discussed as well .",
    "however , it is turned out that the dirac cp phase introduced to break the @xmath1 symmetry does not lead to successful leptogenesis , and thus we need a subsidiary source for the lepton asymmetry .",
    "we will show that a tiny breaking of the degeneracy between two heavy majorana neutrinos , in addition , can lead to successful leptogenesis without much affecting the predictions of the low energy neutrino observables .",
    "we will also examine how leptogenesis can be related with low energy neutrino measurement , and show that our predictions for @xmath0 and @xmath3 can be constrained by the current observation of baryon asymmetry .",
    "to begin with , let us consider the lagrangian of the lepton sector from which the seesaw mechanism works , @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 are @xmath11 lepton doublet fields , charged lepton singlet fields and higgs scalar , singlet heavy majorana neutrino , respectively , and @xmath12 denotes heavy majorana neutrino masses . here",
    "we take a basis in which both charged lepton and singlet majorana neutrino mass matrices are real and diagonal . the neutrino dirac yukawa matrix with @xmath1 symmetry",
    "is given in the cp conserving limit by @xmath13 where we assumed that @xmath14 is symmetric .",
    "the majorana mass matrix @xmath15 with @xmath1 symmetry is given in the diagonal form by @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "note the degeneracy of @xmath17 from the presumed @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "later we will discuss the effects of breaking the mass degeneracy , too .",
    "then , the effective light neutrino mass matrix generated through seesaw mechanism reflects @xmath1 symmetry which in turn leads to maximal mixing of the atmospheric neutrinos and vanishing mixing angle @xmath18 in pmns mixing matrix . in order to obtain non - vanishing @xmath18 , we have to break @xmath1 symmetry appropriately .",
    "the @xmath1 symmetry breaking can generally be achieved by imposing splittings between the same entries in the mass matrices @xmath14 and @xmath15 . in this paper , however , we break the symmetry by introducing a cp phase in the dirac yukawa matrix @xmath14 so that the same entries are distinguishable by the phase . in principle",
    ", we can arbitrarily introduce cp phases in the above dirac yukawa matrix to break the symmetry .",
    "however , we note that any phases appearing in ( 2 - 3 ) sub - matrix of the effective light neutrino mass matrix should be small to satisfy the experimental result of @xmath19 @xcite . in this regard , it is relevant to impose cp phases in ( 2,1 ) and/or ( 3,1 ) entries of the dirac yukawa matrix while keeping any entries in ( 2 - 3 ) sub - matrix of the effective light neutrino mass matrix real . for simplicity",
    ", we take the ( 3,1 ) entry to include a cp phase . actually , either choice is turned out to be completely equivalent . incorporating a cp phase in ( 3,1 ) entry of the dirac mass matrix ,",
    "the effective light neutrino mass matrix through seesaw mechanism is given by @xmath20 as one can easily see , the non - trivial value of the cp phase @xmath21 in the mass matrix @xmath22 breaks the @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "first , we consider how the neutrino mixing angles and neutrino mass spectrum can be predicted in our scenario .",
    "as can be expected from the structure of the above @xmath22 , in our model only the normal hierarchical mass spectrum is allowed because the inverted hierarchical case is achieved only when the off - diagonal elements in heavy majorana neutrino mass matrix are dominant @xcite , which is in contrast with the case of our model .",
    "furthermore , considering the normal hierarchy and the maximality of the atmospheric neutrino mixing , one can expect the following hierarchical structure among the elements of the effective light neutrino mass matrix : @xmath23 in terms of the light neutrino mass eigenvalues @xmath24 , the above condition ( [ cond1 ] ) leads to @xmath25 ) : @xmath26 where the degree of the hierarchy in eq .",
    "( [ rel_ynu2 ] ) will depend on that of the heavy majorana masses @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "introducing new parameters from the ratios among the parameters given in eq .",
    "( [ meff ] ) , @xmath29 we can re - parameterize the neutrino mass matrix @xmath22 as follows : @xmath30 depending on the hierarchy of the heavy majorana neutrino masses @xmath27 and @xmath28 , the relative sizes of the new parameters consistent with the normal hierarchy of the neutrino mass spectrum and the hierarchy of @xmath31 and @xmath32 can be classified as follows : @xmath33 note that @xmath34 is negative as can be seen in the relation ( [ rel_ynu1 ] ) , and the quantity @xmath35 is very small compared to the other ones in @xmath22 . for numerical purpose",
    ", we consider the case of @xmath36 without a loss of generality .",
    "then the neutrino mass matrix @xmath22 is simplified as @xmath37 where the complex variables are distinguished by the tilde .",
    "this neutrino mass matrix is diagonalized by the pmns mixing matrix @xmath38 , @xmath39 $ ] , where @xmath40 indicates the mass eigenvalues of light majorana neutrinos .",
    "but , we diagonalize the hermitian matrix @xmath41 @xcite instead , so that we can easily obtain the mixing angles and phases appeared in @xmath38 in terms of the parameters appeared in eq .",
    "( [ matrix ] ) , @xmath42 where @xmath43 here we note that @xmath44 and @xmath45 are real .",

    "let us discuss the numerical results focusing on the three cases given in ( [ cases ] ) .",
    "as a result of the numerical analysis concerned with the mixing angle @xmath52 , we found that the case 1 ( @xmath53 ) is ruled out mainly because we get a very small @xmath52 for all the parameter space in this case .",

    "<S> we found that a tiny breaking of the @xmath1 symmetry due to mass splitting between two degenerate heavy majorana neutrinos on top of the dirac cp phase can lead to successful leptogenesis . </S>",
    "<S> we examine how leptogenesis can be related with low energy neutrino measurement , and show that our predictions for @xmath0 and @xmath3 can be constrained by the current observation of baryon asymmetry . </S>"
