    "in recent years there has been much interest in development of strongly confining traps for ultra - cold atoms .",
    "such traps are particularly attractive for the production of lower dimensional bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) .",
    "although condensates were initially produced in magnetic traps @xcite , optical traps are an attractive alternative due to their flexibility and may be used to generate traps of strength greatly beyond those of conventional magnetic traps @xcite .",
    "a widely used optical trap of this sort is an optical lattice @xcite .",
    "optical lattice experiments have been performed in a wide variety of contexts and may be made of very high strength for the study of some quantum mechanical phenomenon @xcite .",
    "lattice traps , despite this capacity , have a limitation .",
    "typically an optical lattice has a spacing of half the laser wavelength  order a few hundred nanometers .",
    "condensates loaded into these traps which are initially of a size greater than @xmath19 are typically split into thousands of distinct condensates .",
    "this limits the addressability of the individual condensates which is desirable for direct atom statistics study of some states such as the mott - insulator transition @xcite and the tonks - girardeau gas regime @xcite and required for others such as the proposed quantum tweezer for atoms @xcite .",
    "we present an optical trap that may be used to enter these regimes , yet it a single site trap and therefore addressable .",
    "from an input gaussian . ( a )",
    "an input gaussian passes the phase plate ( pp ) giving a relative @xmath4 phase shift between the halves of the beam .",
    "( b ) the aperture ( a ) is in the far field of the output beam from pp .",
    "this produces the fourier transform at a. ( c ) higher spatial modes are truncated by a. ( d ) lens l1 produces the fourier transform of the output of a resulting in a near @xmath0mode profile .",
    "( e ) a true @xmath0beam , the profile in ( d ) only deviates in small fringes outside the main lobes .",
    "the images are numerically calculated beam profiles shown as @xmath20 . ]    our approach to creating a high frequency trap for a bec is based on a hermite - gaussian @xmath0mode beam .",
    "this beam profile has the advantage of having a dark line in the center of the profile . for light detuned blue of an atomic transition this provides a strongly confining trap .",
    "the intensity of a hermite - gaussian @xmath0beam is given by @xcite : @xmath21 in terms of the beam power @xmath22 and waist sizes @xcite @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the coordinates axes @xmath25 and @xmath26 are orthogonal to the axis of propagation @xmath1 and refer to either @xmath27 , @xmath28 , or @xmath29 depending on the beam orientation : @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 for horizontally and @xmath33 , @xmath31 , and @xmath34 for vertically propagating beams as in fig .",

    "the optical dipole potential for a two - level atom with transition frequency @xmath35 produced by light of frequency @xmath36 with intensity profile @xmath37 is @xcite @xmath38 where the central trap depth is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the natural line width of the transition , @xmath41 is the saturation intensity , and @xmath42 . by expanding eq .",
    "( [ eqn : optical_potential ] ) about @xmath43 , the trap oscillation frequency in the @xmath25 direction inside the @xmath0trap can be shown to be @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the mass of the atom . from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : trap_frequency ] ) , it is clear that the trap frequency increases with larger power and smaller waist size in the @xmath25 direction .",
    "a concern with using optical traps is the rate of spontaneous scattering events .",
    "such events lead to heating of the atoms .",
    "this rate is given by @xcite @xmath46 in a beam of intensity given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : tem_equation ] ) , @xmath47 vanishes , but the scattering rate may be estimated by calculating it at the harmonic oscillator length @xmath48 .",
    "the rate is low because of the very large detuning used , typically there are no events during the optical trap time .",
    "although it is possible to have a laser directly output a non - gaussian beam , we use a simple holographic method to produce the @xmath0mode beams which are used for the optical trap .",
    "the concept is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : tem_fourier ] .",
    "the input gaussian beam passes a coated phase plate which produces a relative @xmath4 phase difference between two halves of the beam .",
    "this eliminates the gaussian component of the beam and leaves it as some superposition of the higher modes .",
    "because higher spatial frequencies correspond to larger angles , they are filtered by the aperture which truncates the large wings of the beam .",
    "this output is then imaged to produce a nearly @xmath0profile . in fig .",

    "the coating is a 6900@xmath52 thick @xmath3 layer that extends along half of the face with a sharp straight line boundary @xcite .",
    "the windows we have used were masked and coated in a vapor deposition machine .",
    "the plate takes an input gaussian mode beam which is aligned as to intersect the plate with half of the beam on the @xmath3 coating and half off .",
    "this is the first element of the optical system shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tem_fourier ] .",

    "[ fig : tem01profile ] along with a profile in the narrow direction .",
    "the @xmath0beam shown has a waist radius of 125@xmath53 in the axial direction which is much longer than the bec region to provide a relatively uniform trap .",
    "the figure shows a fit to the ideal intensity profile of a @xmath0given in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : tem_equation ] ) which results in @xmath51 .",
    "it is noted that the measured profile fits that of an actual @xmath0beam very well which justifies our use of the simple formula given by eq .",

    "absorption imaging beams for both vertical and horizontal diagnostics . l1 and l2 are the final lenses in the vertical and horizontal beam paths , dm1 and dm2 are dichroic mirrors , agm is a silver mirror .",
    "gravity in the figure is in the @xmath54 direction . ]    for production of bose - einstein condensates , we have designed an experimental setup which consists of a double magneto - optic trap ( mot ) system contained in an ultra - high vacuum chamber with upper and lower mot regions separated by a differential pumping tube .",
    "the upper mot is a six beam vapor cell mot including an additional push beam which allows for loading of the lower mot @xcite .",
    "the lower mot is contained by a custom @xmath55 ( outer ) rectangular fused silica glass cell with @xmath56 thick walls .",
    "the glass cell is an ultra - high vacuum region ( uhv ) and is the location for all experiments .",
    "surrounding the glass cell is a quadrupole ioffe configuration ( quic ) magnetic trap @xcite .",

    "the atoms are then cooled via forced rf evaporative cooling for about @xmath59s .",
    "this procedure produces an atom cloud of @xmath61 @xmath58rb atoms near condensation . the cloud is then transferred adiabatically into a symmetric @xmath59hz magnetic trap in the glass cell center by ramping down the current in the quadrupole coils while keeping the ioffe coil current high . placing the atoms back in the center of the glass cell",
    "allows for good optical access for the optical trap beams and for imaging of the atoms .    the beam interaction and imaging region of the setup",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : beam_path ] .",
    "the setup includes horizontal and vertical input ports for visible light , which are used for our @xmath0beams .",
    "there is also an input port for a vertical infrared beam which is used for a radial confinement beam .",
    "the lenses l1 and l2 provide the final focusing of the optical trap beams .",
    "the optical trap we are describing here consists of a horizontally oriented @xmath0beam ( @xmath62 ) which will support the atoms against gravity and a vertical infrared beam of circular gaussian profile which provides a weak radial confinement @xcite .",
    "the trap involves several configurations which allow for loading of atoms into the h@xmath0node .",
    "after initial preparation , atoms in the symmetric @xmath59hz magnetic trap in the glass cell center may be transferred into the h@xmath0beam by the steps shown pictorially in fig . [",
    "fig : htem_loading ] .",
    "it is not possible to directly capture the atoms into the h@xmath0beam because the node spacing is only a few micrometers , but the size of the initial cloud is of order @xmath63 .",
    "the steps are as follows : ( a ) the h@xmath0beam is ramped on below the magnetically trapped atoms and the vertical infrared beam ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : htem_loading ] ) is turned on to provide a weak radial confinement of @xmath64 .",
    "( b ) the center of the magnetic trap is moved below the h@xmath0beam which now acts as a sheet against which the atoms are pressed .",
    "this increases the collision rate high enough for evaporation .",
    "the magnetic trap is ramped off while the atoms evaporate radially out of the infrared trap .",
    "this produces a condensate of up to @xmath65 atoms .",
    "the atoms remain in a pancake shaped configuration pressed against the sheet by gravity .",
    "( c ) the atoms are now captured inside another h@xmath0which is ramped on in @xmath66 , @xmath67 above the lower one .",

    "( c ) transfer step into h@xmath0beam .",
    "( d ) final optical trap inside h@xmath0beam .",
    "this trap has vertical trap frequency @xmath69 . ]",
    "the pair of h@xmath0beams just discussed are actually both multiplexes of the same beam .",
    "the basic idea here is to use a multiple frequency acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) @xcite to produce several spots controlled independently with the driving radio frequency ( rf ) .",
    "such an aom is driven with multiple frequencies of the form @xmath70 in this case , @xmath71 and each signal is generated by an rf synthesizer and combined with an rf power combiner .",
    "each frequency produces a distinct first order diffraction angle .",
    "when imaged this leads to @xmath72 spots which have spacing determined by the difference in drive frequency and intensity by the rf power at each frequency .",
    "this method allows for precise control of the positions and intensities of the spots relative to each other and provides a powerful tool for condensate manipulation .",
    "after the final trap configuration , the atoms are released suddenly and allowed to fall . during this time , the cloud shows a change of aspect ratio which indicates that the cloud had crossed the bec transition in the trap @xcite .",
    "the atom clouds are observed destructively with absorption imaging .",
    "this involves a @xmath73 exposure with a resonant ( @xmath8 ) laser which is imaged onto a ccd camera . under the assumption that the wavefunction in the strongly confined direction is gaussian  that of the harmonic oscillator ground state @xcite , the cloud image may be fit and vertical size characterized by @xmath74 .",
    "the rate of vertical expansion in this case depends on the trap frequency in that direction as in @xmath75 condensates in a high frequency trap exhibit a much larger rate of expansion in this direction .",
    "[ fig : htem_expansion ] shows expansion of atoms from a h@xmath0trap .",
    "the beam used in this case had parameters : @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 with wavelength @xmath6 , from which equations [ eqn : u0 ] and [ eqn : trap_frequency ] give @xcite a trap depth of @xmath79 and a trap frequency of @xmath80 .",
    "the spontaneous scattering rate may be estimated from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : r ] ) at the harmonic oscillator length @xmath81 , which results in @xmath82 , meaning that over the time of the experiment there is unlikely to be a single event .",
    "the line fit in fig .",
    "[ fig : htem_expansion ] indicates a trap frequency of @xmath83 , consistent with calculations .",
    "the trap frequencies of the h@xmath0trap are made high due in part to the tight focus obtained with @xmath76 . because of the slightly better @xmath84 of l1 @xcite over l2 in fig .",
    "[ fig : beam_path ] , a vertical @xmath0(@xmath85 ) in our system can obtain even tighter focus as in fig .",
    "[ fig : tem01profile ] .",
    "the largest trap frequency we have observed in our system with this method is @xmath86 , which has been for this v@xmath0beam with @xmath87 , @xmath77 , and @xmath88 . by loading a condensate into a crossed @xmath0(@xmath89 ) trap consisting of both the h@xmath0and v@xmath0mentioned here , it is possible to create a one - dimensional bec @xcite .",

    "the lower picture is a 3-d condenstate and does not obey equation [ eqn : sigma_in_time ] . ]",
    "the h@xmath0trap alone produces a two - dimensional condensate .",
    "the wavefunction of the condensate may be written assuming a gaussian profile in the strongly confined direction and a thomas - fermi shape in the radial directions @xcite . in the strongly confined direction ,",
    "the atoms occupy the single particle ground state energy level with value @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is planck s constant . the trap frequency , calculated from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : trap_frequency ] ) , is that for the center of the trap .",
    "spatially , the trap frequency has a radial dependence @xmath93 which implies a spatial ground state energy shift .",
    "this dependence is due to the gaussian beam profile along the @xmath26 axis and the @xmath94 dependance on propagation distance @xmath1 , see note @xcite .",
    "the result is a weak potential of the form @xmath95 and @xmath96 in these directions .",
    "the radial trap frequencies may be written as @xmath97 and @xmath98 where the approximation @xmath99 was used in deriving eq .",
    "( [ eqn : trap_frequency_s ] ) .",
    "these complex oscillation frequencies each represent an anti - trapping potential . for the @xmath100 h@xmath0trap discussed above ,",
    "these anti - trapping frequencies are @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "the vertical infrared beam which provides a weak radial confinement of @xmath64 over compensates this effect and radially traps the atoms . in the case",
    "mentioned using a x@xmath0configuration for a one - dimensional trap @xcite , @xmath103 plays no role because of the geometry and only the tiny @xmath104 is an issue .    here in lies a major advantage of the @xmath0trap over other blue traps , for example , a blue gaussian sheet pair each with power @xmath105 .",
    "when the sheets are separated in @xmath25 by @xmath106 , they have an optimum trap frequency given by @xmath107 similar to eq .",
    "( [ eqn : trap_frequency ] ) but reduced by a factor of @xmath108 .",
    "in addition to having a lower trapping frequency in the strong direction , these traps have much larger anti - trapping frequencies .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath0trap which has a zero intensity profile along the @xmath26 axis at @xmath43 , this trap has a gaussian axial intensity profile which produces an anti - trap in addition to the weak ground state shift anti - trap described above .",
    "these effects result in trap frequencies @xmath109 where @xmath110 is due to the axial intensity profile and @xmath111 the ground state shift .",
    "these add in quadrature to give the overall @xmath112 .",
    "the first does not exist for the @xmath0trap and is the larger effect .",
    "the second corresponds with eq .",
    "( [ eqn : trap_frequency_p ] ) . using the same parameters as the h@xmath0trap above ,",
    "this double gaussian trap has trap frequencies @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "that is , this trap has less than half the trap frequency in the @xmath25 direction and more than an order of magnitude larger anti - trapping frequency in the @xmath26 direction .",
    "it is worth noting that a blue trap with a dark trapping region as presented here has several advantages over a red trap @xcite .",
    "a red trap produces an attractive potential where the atoms are high field seeking .",
    "this results in a larger spontaneous scattering rate . because red traps use longer wavelength light , they are also more limited in focus size",
    " this is critical for obtaining very high trap frequencies .",
    "an additional limitation is the depth of the traps produced .",
    "if one imagines using a single red sheet used to produce a condensate as described in our h@xmath0trap , it is clear that the red trap will have an attractive potential in the radial directions . because the trap is so deep evaporative cooling is difficult .",
    "recent work with a @xmath0beam combined with a magnetic trap has produced quasi-2d condensates @xcite . in their experiment ,",
    "the authors operate in a regime where the focus in both @xmath25 and @xmath26 directions is much larger than in the case presented here . because of the longer depth of focus and larger @xmath24 used in their experiment",
    ", the optical trap has a more uniform potential .",
    "this is a preferred regime in which to operate for the study of vortex dynamics in two - dimensions , for example , as the authors point out .",
    "the central trap frequencies , however , obtained are considerably smaller : by a factor of 10 for the h@xmath0trap and a factor of 30 for v@xmath0trap than in the case presented here . for the possibility of entering regimes of quantum gases as mentioned earlier @xcite , such trapping strengths are required .",
    "we have proven a method to create @xmath0beams with a holographic plate and provided a method for loading a bec into the tightly confined @xmath0trap .",
    "this method pushes the possibilities of making single lower dimensional condensates .",
    "the trapping strengths which have been obtained in these single site optical traps are comparable to those often obtained in optical lattices .",
    "this technique paves the way towards experiments with single highly confined condensates .",
