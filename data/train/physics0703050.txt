    "it is now an established fact that zonal flows ( zfs ) ( i.e. , azimuthally symmetric modes that depend only on the radial coordinate ) play a crucial role in regulating the nonlinear evolution of drift - wave instabilities in tokamaks , and consequently , the level of turbulent transport @xcite . in particular , it is known that triggering of the l - h transition in tokamaks is related to the emergence of zfs in the poloidal direction which suppresses the fluctuations and build up a barrier to the turbulent transport .",
    "it is widely thought that zonal flows are generated by the modulational instability of the turbulent spectrum of electrostatic drift - wave perturbations @xcite . under this , two possible regimes can be indicated : ( a ) when the spectrum is broad , integration over all wavenumbers yields a resonant instability ; ( b ) when the drift wave spectrum is narrow , one can consider the instability of a monochromatic drift wave and the instability is of the modulational type . in the latter case ,",
    "standard schemes of the four - wave interaction can be applied @xcite .",
    "ion temperature gradient ( itg ) modes and trapped electron modes are generally regarded as the main candidates to explain the anomalous transport , but , recently , there has been the growth of interest in electron temperature gradient driven turbulence , produced by the electron temperature gradient driven modes @xcite .",
    "this is related to the fact that the study of interaction of etg modes with large - scale motions like zfs or streamers ( radially elongated vortex - type structures ) is important for understanding the electron thermal transport within an internal transport barriers , when itg turbulence is suppressed by @xmath2 shear flow @xcite .",
    "note , that there is an important difference between the itg and etg models : in the etg model we have the boltzmann ion response for both waves and zonal flows , while the electron response to zonal flow perturbations is hydrodynamic in the itg model @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we consider the excitation of zfs by a finite amplitude monochromatic drift wave in the framework of etg turbulence model .",
    "the corresponding etg mode is assumed to be stable , i. e. we consider the region below the marginal stability boundary .",
    "we derive a set of coupled equations describing the nonlinear interaction of drift etg modes and zfs and show that zfs can be readily excited by the modulational instability .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sectionmodelequations ] a set of normalized fluid equations describing etg drift modes  zf interaction is introduced . in sec .",
    "[ sectionmodulationinstability ] , the nonlinear dispersion relation is obtained and the modulational instability growth rate behavior is analyzed .",
    "[ sectionconclusions ] contains summary and conclusions .",
    "assuming a slab two - dimensional geometry , charge quasineutrality and the adiabatic ion responce , we consider the following simplified model describing curvature driven etg turbulence in the inviscid limit ( see , e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the normalized electrostatic potential and plasma pressure respectively , and @xmath6 is the jakobian . in equations ( [ modeleq1 ] ) and ( [ modeleq2 ] ) , following the notations of ref .",

    "for @xmath23 , the stable etg modes are confined inside the region @xmath24 .",
    "below we restrict our analysis to the case of linearly stable etg drift waves .",
    "assuming that the zonal flow varies on much larger timescale than etg drift waves do , the standard decomposition into fast ( @xmath25 , etg drift wave related ) and slow ( @xmath26 , zonal flow related ) motions can be performed .",
    "the perturbations of electrostatic potential @xmath4 and plasma pressure @xmath5 are presented as a sum of fast and slow parts @xmath27 following the standard averaging procedure ( recall that we consider the region below the marginal stability boundary , i.e. the subcritical turbulence ) one gets the following set of equations @xmath28 when obtaining the system ( [ decomposedsystemeq1 ] ) - ( [ decomposedsystemeq4 ] ) , we have assumed that the mean field is described by the same model equations as the fluctuations , but is driven by the reynolds stress .",
    "this follows from the assumption of adiabatic ion response for the flow as well as fluctuations , which is valid for the etg modes .",
    "we describe the interaction between drft etg modes and zf in terms of a four - wave coupling scheme , i.e. , each fluctuation is taken to be coherent .",
    "then , the etg drift waves are considered as a superposition of the pump wave @xmath29 and two sidebands @xmath30 , i.e. , @xmath31 where @xmath32 zonal flow related electrostatic potential and pressure are taken in the form @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the wave vector of the zonal flow , and the resonant conditions @xmath35 and @xmath36 hold , where @xmath37 is the etg drift mode frequency , given by equation ( [ lineardispersion ] ) with the @xmath38 sign in front of the square root .",
