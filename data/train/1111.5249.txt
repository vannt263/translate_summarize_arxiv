    "there has been a great deal of progress in studying two - dimensional integrable field theories in the presence of defects or internal boundaries , in both classical and quantum context @xcite . from the classical point of view",
    ", the lagrangian formalism @xcite has shown to be significantly successful . in this framework ,",
    "the usual variational principle from a local lagrangian density located at some fixed point , reveals frozen bcklund transformations as the defect conditions for the fields .",
    "there are many interesting features of these defects .",
    "it turns out that these kind of defect conditions allow for several types of integrable field theories @xcite , not only the energy conservation but also the conservation of a modified momentum , which includes a defect contribution .",
    "moreover , their integrability is provided by the existence of a modified lax pair involving a limit procedure , but in general it was only checked explicitly for a few conserved charges . as a novel feature of most of these models",
    "is that only physical fields were present within the formulation and therefore the associated bcklund transformations were called type - i @xcite .",
    "however , it was noticed that not all the possible relativistic integrable models could be accommodate within this framework and then it was proposed a generalization by allowing a defect to have its own degree of freedom , and the associated bcklund transformations were named type - ii @xcite .",
    "many examples were also discussed in @xcite like sine / sinh - gordon , liouville , massive free field and tzitzica - bullogh - dodd model .",
    "concerning type - ii defects , it is interesting to note that for the supersymmetric extensions of sine - gordon model @xcite and for the massive thirring models @xcite those auxiliary boundary fields , which correspond to the degree of freedom of the defect itself , had already appeared naturally .    on the other hand , recently it was suggested an alternative and systematic new approach to defects in classical integrable field theories @xcite .",
    "the inverse scattering method formalism is used and the defect conditions corresponding to frozen bcklund transformations are encoded in a well - known defect matrix .",
    "this matrix provided an elegant way to compute the modified conserved quantities , ensuring integrability . using this framework",
    "the generating function for the modified conserved charges for any integrable evolution equation of the akns scheme were computed , and the type - ii bcklund transformations for the sine - gordon and tzitzica - bullough - dodd models has been also recovered @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that this method for constructing integrable initial boundary value problems based on the bcklund transformations has already been used in @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide an alternative approach in order to establish the integrability of the bosonic and grassmannian thirring models with type - ii defects , which were suggested by previous approaches @xcite . at this point",
    "it is worth mentioning that there exists no totally clear definition of what integrability is for classical systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom .",
    "however , in this work we adopt the popular point of view where a system is regarded as integrable , if for its describing equations of motion it is possible to determine a constructive way of finding solutions and to show the existence of sufficient number of conserved quantities . even though this viewpoint is not complete , it is sufficient for our immediate purposes . since soliton solutions for these models",
    "have already been studied in @xcite , herein we will focus on the explicit construction of their conserved quantities .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , for the sake of clearness we present the standard setting of the lax pair approach for the general @xmath1 spectral linear problem ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "one of the most important results of this approach and that is the main point for our purposes is the identification of sets of coupled riccati equations in order to construct conservation laws by a simple generalization of the method used by wadatti and sogo for the particular case @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "other different generalizations , considering particularly matrix riccati - type equations , have also been appeared in the literature concerning to multicomponent systems ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) .    within this framework , for the simplest case @xmath2 the defect contributions to the infinite set of modified integrals of motion",
    "were explicitly derived for several integrable equations associated with the @xmath3 lie algebra - valued lax pair like : ( m)kdv , nls , liouville and sine / sinh - gordon equations for which previous results derived from lagrangian principles @xcite were also recovered .",
    "more recently , the modified energy and momentum for the tzitzica model with type - ii defects , which can be described by a @xmath4 lie algebra - valued lax pair , were also explicitly computed @xcite and showed complete agreement with the results obtained by lagrangian approach @xcite . then , motivated by these results , in section 3 we derive a general formula to compute the defect contributions to the infinite sets of modified conserved quantities for any @xmath1 linear problem .    in section 4 , firstly we use this formula to compute explicitly the defect contributions to the modified energy and momentum for the bosonic thirring model .",
    "these significant results shed an interesting new light on the question of what type of bcklund transformations may be used as defect conditions since its lagrangian description has not been derived until now .",
    "subsequently , in section 5 we extend the procedure to include the pure fermionic version of the thirring model which is described by @xmath5 algebra - valued lax pair . we recursively compute the defect contributions to the modified energy and momentum and show that the results are in full agreement with the ones previously obtained by the lagrangian formalism @xcite .    in section 6 ,",
    "we discuss in some detail how the question of involutivity of the charges can be addressed and how a hamiltonian formulation can be provided to include type - ii bcklund transformations which carry degrees of freedom corresponding to the defect itself .",
    "some concluding remarks are made in section 7 . in appendix",
    "a , we give a very short review of the sine - gordon model with type - i defects within the framework adopted in this paper .",
    "in this section we want to discuss the main ideas of the lax formulation in order to construct an infinite set of independent conserved quantities for some integrable evolution equations .",
    "such equations can be formulated as a compatibility condition of an associated linear auxiliary problem as follows , _ t ( x , t ; ) = v(x , t ; ) ( x , t;),[s2e0.1 ] + _ x ( x , t ; ) = u(x , t ; ) ( x , t;),[s2e0.2 ] where @xmath6 is an @xmath7-dimensional vector , @xmath8 is a spectral parameter , and @xmath9 are @xmath1 matrices , which usually are named lax pair .",
    "then , from the compatibility condition , @xmath10 , we obtain the zero - curvature equation , _ t u - _ x v + = 0,[s2e0.3 ] which gives the corresponding equations of motion for the integrable system .",
    "now , let us show how to construct a generating function for the infinite set of conservation laws .",
    "firstly , for every auxiliary field component @xmath11 with @xmath12 , we can define a set of @xmath13 auxiliary functions @xmath14 with @xmath15 .",
    "then , considering the linear system ( [ s2e0.1 ] , ) and ( [ s2e0.2 ] ) , it is not so difficult to identify the @xmath16-th conservation equation , _",

    "j = _ -^x .",
    "[ s2e0.7 ]    a wide group of integrable nonlinear evolution equations can be formulated using this approach , among which the most of known examples correspond to the particular case @xmath2 , e.g , the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls ) , korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) and the modified kdv equation ( mkdv ) , liouville equation , and sine / sinh - gordon . for a more complete review of these cases",
    "see for example @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that if the respective analytic properties of the solutions are considered , we can expand the functions @xmath17 in positive and negative powers of @xmath8 and then solve ( [ equa2.4 ] ) and ( [ s2e0.6 ] ) recursively for each coefficient .",
    "this immediately provides an expansion of the @xmath16-th generating function @xmath23 in powers of @xmath8 , obtaining in this way an infinite set of conserved quantities .",
    "in particular , the usual conserved energy and momentum integrals of motion , commonly also derived from the lagrangian formalism , turn out to be linear combinations of these set of conserved quantities @xmath23 , by taking into account coefficients for the expansions in both positive and negative powers @xmath8",
    ". however , these sets of conserved quantities are not functionally independent in the bulk theory because not all of the auxiliary fields @xmath17 are independent .",
    "although , it seems that there is no need to consider all the conservation laws to derive the apparently overdetermined sets of conserved quantities , the recent results on type - ii integrable defects @xcite suggest that for obtaining the most general form for the defect potentials , it is necessary to consider all the information coming from the lax pair , i.e. , all the conservation laws . to make it clearer , in the following section we will derive the formula for obtaining the modified conserved quantities which helps us to compute integrable defect potentials",
    "in this section we consider the lax pair approach for constructing the infinite sets of modified conserved quantities in the presence of defects .",
    "firstly , let us consider a defect placed at @xmath24 , and suppose that there are two column - vector functions @xmath25 and @xmath26 corresponding to the auxiliary linear problems for @xmath27 described by the lax pair @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and for @xmath30 by @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "then , let us introduce @xmath33 , a matrix polynomial of the spectral parameter @xmath8 , to connect the two solutions , namely , ( x , t ; ) & = & k(x , t;)(x , t ; ) , [ s3e0.1 ] where , @xmath34 satisfies differential equations corresponding to a gauge transformation @xcite as follows , _ t k = k - kv , [ s3e0.2 ] _ x k = k - uv , and it is commonly named the _ defect matrix _ @xcite .",
    "this matrix is expected to generate the defect conditions and consequently the corresponding auto - bcklund transformation of the model .",
    "a classification of these defect matrices was performed as well as several examples corresponding to the @xmath2 linear problem were examined by choosing a very simple form for this matrix @xcite .",
    "we present now a straightforward extension in order to consider the @xmath0 matrix auxiliary linear problem .",
    "let us consider the generating functions ( [ s2e0.7 ] ) in the presence of the defect , _",
    "-^0 x+ _ 0^x",
    ". hence , taking the time derivative and using the conservation equation ( [ s2e0.4 ] ) , we get & = & |_x=0 -|_x=0 .",
    "[ s3e0.5 ] then , it is not difficult to show that the relation between the two sets of auxiliary functions @xmath35 and @xmath17 is given by _",

[ formu ]",
    "this formula is an important result because its expansion in powers of @xmath8 provides the defect contributions to the modified conserved quantities at all orders for every @xmath0 associated linear problem",

    "in particular , it will be shown that the modified energy and momentum contributions can be computed from certain linear combinations of the set of conserved quantities @xmath38 , taking into account all the possible conservation laws , i.e. , for @xmath12 .",
    "it is worth noting that a similar approach was already used in @xcite to prove the classical and quantum integrability of the sine - gordon model with defects , by using the monodromy matrix language . in the same work",
    "all higher conserved quantities are found by using a matrix bcklund tranformation and a matrix riccati equation .",
    "some of these results are recovered using our approach in appendix a.",
    "in this section , we apply the method described by computing explicitly the defect contributions to the modified energy and momentum for the bt model .",

    "these results are in complete agreement with the ones obtained based on variational principles @xcite .",

    "we discuss some useful ideas in addressing this question but a more complete description of the hamiltonian approach will be postponed for a future work .",
    "so far , an infinite set of independent modified conserved quantities arising from the defect contributions have been systematically constructed through a general formula derived from a variant of the classical inverse scattering method , which are from our point of view sufficient for these kind of defects to be regarded as integrable .",
    "however , the question of the involutivity of such quantities ( required to discuss complete integrability in the sense of liouville ) still has to be answered . in this section",
    "we address some relevant facts related with this problem .",
    "certainly , the hamiltonian formulation of the classical inverse scattering method , which is essentially based on the concept of a classical @xmath125-matrix @xcite , is perhaps the most elegant and convenient framework to discuss involutivity .",
    "let us start with the main aspects of the method in order to discuss this issue in the bulk . in the inverse scattering method",
    "the construction of the action - angle variables depends basically on the entries of the monodromy matrix @xmath126 , where t(x , y ; ) = p \\{_y^x u(z ; ) dz } , is the transition matrix , @xmath127 is the @xmath18-part of the lax ( [ s2e0.2 ] ) at a given time , and @xmath128 being the path ordering .",
    "as it was noticed in @xcite , the existence of the classical @xmath125-matrix , an @xmath129 matrix which satisfies the relation \\{u(x;_1 ) u(y;_2 ) } = ( x - y ) , permits us to write down the poisson brackets between matrix elements of the transition matrix in the following form , \\{t(x , y;_1 ) t(x , y;_2 ) } = , [ e6.3 ] from which it is derived that logarithm of the traces of the monodromy matrix commute for different values of the spectral parameter , namely \\{(_1),(_2 ) } = 0.[e6.4 ] expanding ( [ e6.4 ] ) with respect to @xmath130 and @xmath131 , we get the involutivity of the conserved quantities @xmath132 , which means that @xmath133 is the generating functional for the integrals of motion .",
    "let us mention that the explicit form of the @xmath125-matrix for the massive thirring models can be found in @xcite .",
    "now , let us discuss how the classical @xmath125-matrix approach is modified by including jump - defect ( or point like - defect ) in the system .",
    "as it was noticed in @xcite and more recently in @xcite , the description of an integrable defect in the @xmath125-matrix approach requires to introduce a modified transition matrix , ( x , y ; ) = t(x,0^+ ; ) k^-1(0;)t(0 ^ -,y;),[e6.5 ] which is a combined bulk - defect transition matrix , where @xmath134 and @xmath135 are the bulk transition matrices corresponding to @xmath30 and @xmath27 respectively , and @xmath136 is the defect matrix whose entries are evaluated in the single point @xmath24 . the key point in order to show liouville integrability is to require that the defect matrix satisfy the poisson algebra ( [ e6.3 ] ) , namely , \\{k^-1(_1 ) k^-1(_2 ) } = , where @xmath137 is the same classical @xmath125-matrix for the bulk transition matrices .",
    "hence , the above requirement is a sufficient condition to obtain the important result , \\{t(x , y;_1 ) ( x , y;_2 ) } = , [ e6.3 ] which guarantees the existence of the infinite set of modified conserved quantities .",
    "similar to the bulk theory , the explicit form of these integrals of motion can be extracted by introducing the following representation for the bulk transition matrix @xcite , t(x , y ; ) = @xmath138 e^z(x , y;)@xmath139 ^ -1 , where @xmath140 is an off - diagonal and @xmath141 a diagonal matrix .",
    "then , the logarithm of the trace of the modified monodromy matrix ( [ e6.5 ] ) is the generating function of the modified conserved quantities , where the defect contributions in an appropriate expansion in @xmath8 , read @xcite : d ( ) = _ ii , where the subscript @xmath142 denotes the leading term coming from the trace of the modified monodromy matrix for the given expansion . at first sight , it seems not to exist a direct relationship between the above result and the generating function ( [ formu ] ) what we have worked with .",
    "however , note that @xmath140 satisfy a matrix riccati equation similar to ( [ equa2.4 ] ) , which permits us to derive recursively its coefficients in an asymptotic series expansion as @xmath143 and @xmath144 , and to demonstrate order by order that the results are complete equivalent for the massive thirring models .",
    "this analysis deserves more attention than we could give at this moment and is left for future investigations .",
    "it is remarkable that the approach we have adopted ( see also @xcite ) , uses essentially an on - shell defect matrix which implies that its entries have non - vanishing poisson brackets with the bulk monodromy matrices elements .",
    "this fact has already been outlined in @xcite for the hamiltonian formulation of the type - ii defects in the sine - gordon and tzitzica model , where the defect conditions appear as a set of second class constraints on the fields , which induces a slight modification of the canonical poisson brackets .",
    "this issue indeed can be solved by working firstly with the off - shell defect matrix to compute the poisson brackets and then derive the constraints as consistency conditions in constructing the time - like operator in the lax pair such that the zero curvature condition provides the same equations of motion as the ones coming from the hamiltonian evolution derived via poisson brackets @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a systematic approach to the integrability problem of the bosonic and grassmannian thirring models with type - ii defects using the inverse scattering formalism .",
    "such a formulation allows to compute explicitly the modified conserved quantities to all orders in terms of the defect matrix .",
    "we have followed the approach to defects in classical integrable field theories given in @xcite , to present for the @xmath1 linear problem , a direct generalization for the generating function of the defect contributions for the modified conserved quantities to all orders .",
    "we have successfully applied this procedure in the case of bosonic ( @xmath2 ) , and grassmannian ( @xmath77 ) thirring models . for the latter ,",
    "we have recovered previous results obtained from the lagrangian approach @xcite .",
    "for the bosonic thirring model , we have also derived explicitly the defect contributions for the energy and momentum .",
    "these results seem not to be reported elsewhere in the literature , and should be of crucial importance for further studies on its possible lagrangian description .",
    "however , a remarkable aspect is that despite the duality relation between the sine - gordon and thirring models , it is not clear for the author why they allow different types of integrable defects , in the sense that the sine - gordon model allows type - i and type - ii defects , but the thirring model apparently only allows type - ii integrable defects .",
    "it is worth exploring in more detail the relation between these type - ii defects through bosonization techniques in future developments .    finally , taking into account the reasons already mentioned in section 6 about the classical @xmath125-matrix description of liouville - integrable point - like defects in integrable field theories",
    ", it should be interesting to investigate the aspects of the complete integrability of the bosonic and grassmannian thirring models with type - ii defects within the hamiltonian framework .",
    "perhaps the most important motivation to perform that further study is the possibility of considering the quantization by the so - called quantum inverse scattering method @xcite .",
    "some of these questions are expected to be developed in future investigations .",
