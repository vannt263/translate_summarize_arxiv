    "the charmonium family is a great laboratory for precision tests of the quark model , because of their relative immunity from complications like relativistic effects and the large value of the strong coupling constant @xmath5 . in this talk ,",
    "a brief review of recent experimental results on charmonium @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 is presented .",
    "although these states were predicted just after the discovery of @xmath6 , their properties were not very clear for a long period .",
    "@xmath3 is the mostly recently discovered charmonium states ; recent studies uncovered its production and properties .",
    "@xmath1 is the lowest - lying @xmath7-wave spin - singlet charmonium state and has been observed through various processes .",
    "its `` inconsistent '' lineshapes in different production modes inspired a couple of precise measurements in the last few years .",
    "the @xmath2 is the first radial excitation of the @xmath8 charmonium ground state .",
    "after 30 years of searching , it was recently observed in charmonium transitions , having been observed in @xmath9 decays and @xmath10 fusion previously .",
    "results in this talk come from besiii , cleo , babar and belle .",
    "besiii and cleo study charmonium from @xmath4 decays and @xmath11 annihilation near @xmath12 threshold .",
    "they provide very clean and simple environments .",
    "babar and belle are @xmath13factories , which produce charmonium via @xmath10 fusion and @xmath9 decays .",
    "the advantage of studying charmonium in a @xmath13factory is the relatively large statistics and reconstruction efficiency .",
    "of the charmonium states below @xmath12 threshold , the @xmath14 is experimentally the least accessible . that is because it can not be produced directly in @xmath11 annihilation , or appear in the electric dipole transition process of a @xmath15 charmonium state .",
    "statistics and photon detection also made it very challenging for early experiments to observe @xmath3 in charmonium transitions .",
    "information about the spin - dependent interaction of heavy quarks can be obtained from precise measurement of the @xmath16 hyperfine mass splitting @xmath17 , where @xmath18  mev/@xmath19  @xcite is the spin - weighted centroid of the @xmath20 mass and @xmath21 is the mass of the singlet state @xmath3 .",
    "a non - zero hyperfine splitting may give indication of non - vanishing spin - spin interactions in charmonium potential models  @xcite .",
    "the first evidence of the @xmath3 state was reported by the fermilab e760 experiment  @xcite and was based on the process @xmath22 .",
    "this result was subsequently excluded by the successor experiment e835  @xcite , which investigated the same reaction with a larger data sample .",
    "e835 also studied the process @xmath23 , in this case finding an @xmath3 signal . soon after this the cleo collaboration observed the @xmath3 and measured its mass  @xcite by studying the decay chain @xmath24 in @xmath11 collisions .",
    "cleo subsequently presented evidence for @xmath3 decays to multi - pion final states  @xcite .",
    "since these data were collected in 2009 , besiii has put lots of effort into measuring the properties of @xmath3 .    to study the decay @xmath25 , three methods have been used :    * inclusive : in the inclusive mode , only the @xmath26 is detected and the @xmath3 are recognized as a peak in the @xmath26 recoil mass spectrum .",

    "besiii also determined the mass and width of @xmath3 to be @xmath36  mev and @xmath37  mev ( @xmath38 confidence level upper limit is 1.44mev ) , which agree with cleo s observation . with this mass value ,",

    "@xcite , confidence level of the global fit is only 0.0018 for the @xmath1 mass and only 0.0001 for the @xmath1 width .",
