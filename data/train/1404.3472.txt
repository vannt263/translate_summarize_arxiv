    "x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) , containing either an accreting neutron star or black hole , constitute a large fraction of bright x - ray sources in the galaxy .",
    "when they have @xmath1 low mass companions , a companion overfills its roche lobe , and mass transfer from the companion to the central compact star occurs via an accretion disk .",
    "such binaries are further categorized as low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) . besides their prominent x - ray emission ,",
    "lmxbs are generally observable at optical wavelengths , as the accretion disks and/or companion stars radiate sufficiently bright thermal emission .",
    "in addition , the lmxbs are known to be able to launch a jet , producing synchrotron emission detectable from optical / infrared to radio wavelengths ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "studies of jets help understand flux variabilities seen in lmxbs , constrain the fractions of accretion energy channeled to different emission components , and thus allow to draw a full picture for the detailed physical processes occurring in lmxbs",
    ".    the environments in which xrbs are located may be dusty .",
    "the supernova explosions that produced the compact stars are thought to have a fallback process @xcite , due to the impact of the reverse shock wave with the outer stellar envelope . as a result",
    ", part of the ejected material during a supernova explosion may fallback to the newly born compact star . during the evolution of a lmxb",
    ", a substantial amount of mass has been lost from the companion ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "observational evidence as well as theoretical studies show that disk winds or outflows are probably ubiquitous and may be massive ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "if a small fraction of the material from any of the processes is captured to be around a binary , it is conceivable that a circumbinary disk might have formed from the material , acting to intercept part of emission ( x - rays from the central compact star and optical light from the companion and accretion disk ) from the binary system and re - radiate the energy at infrared ( ir ) wavelengths .",
    "indeed , @xcite observed four lmxbs with _ spitzer _",
    "space telescope and found that two of them might harbor a circumbinary dust disk .",
    "moreover , the _ spitzer _ detection of dust emission features in a so - called microquasar ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) clearly indicates the existence of dust material around the lmxb @xcite .",
    "the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) , launched in 2009 december , mapped the whole sky at its bands of 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 , and 22 @xmath2 m ( called w1 , w2 , w3 , and w4 , respectively ) in 2010 @xcite .",
    "the fwhms of the averaged point spread function for wise imaging at the four bands were 61 , 64 , 65 , and 120 , and the sensitivities ( 5@xmath3 ) generally reached were 0.08 , 0.11 , 1 , and 6 mjy . in the wise all - sky images and source catalogue released in 2012 march ,",
    "measurements of over 563 million objects are provided .",
    "therefore wise imaging has provided sensitive measurements of many different types of celestial objects at the ir wavelengths ( see @xcite for details ) .    using the wise data , we have carried out searches for the counterparts to the lmxbs catalogued in @xcite , for the purpose of identifying sources among them with either jets or circumbinary debris disks . in this paper",

    "on the basis of the reported spectral types for the companion stars , we used stellar atmosphere models of the @xcite to estimate the thermal emission . if any flux measurements at optical and near - ir bands for a source are available , the information was collected and then used to construct a broad - band spectrum , which is required for the determination of the presence of any excess emission .",
    "the reddening values to the lmxbs were also collected in order to deredden the observed fluxes .",

    "we re - studied their debris disks with updated information and optical and near - ir data .",
    "using the spectral types , estimated distances , and binary parameters published in literatures ( see table  [ tab : prop ] ) , a stellar spectrum plus that of a standard optically thick , geometrically thin accretion disk @xcite were combined to describe the observed optical and near - ir flux densities . for a0620@xmath000 ,",
    "the masses of the black hole primary and companion and thus the binary orbit s inclination angle @xmath11 used were 11 and 0.7  @xmath12 , and 41  @xcite , respectively .",

    "for the black hole systems in quiescence , the inner edge of a standard accretion disk is not certain ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but the uncertainty affects very little of optical fluxes considered here .",
    "the outer edge of a disk was set at 90% of the roche lobe radius of a primary , at which the disk should be tidally truncated @xcite .",
    "the only free parameter adjusted to describe the optical and near - ir data was the mass accretion rate @xmath13 in the disk .",
    "we found that @xmath14 g  s@xmath15 and 5.5@xmath16 g  s@xmath15 for a0620@xmath000 and xte j1118 + 480 , respectively , were required to produce the model spectra displayed in figure  [ fig : bd ] .",
    "the values are approximately consistent with those reported in @xcite .    in order to fully describe the overall broad - band spectrum of either a0620@xmath000 or xte j1118 + 480 ,",
    "a third component is apparently needed for the excess ir emission seen in the both systems .",
    "arguments for supporting the existence of a circumbinary disk were discussed by @xcite . here following their work ,",
    "the same disk model , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the disk temperature at radius @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the temperature of a companion , was used to fit the excess emission .",
    "the inner disk radius from the center of masses of a binary was set to be 1.7@xmath21 @xcite , where @xmath21 is the binary separation . to simplify the model , the inclination angle of the disk",
    "was set to be aligned with that of the orbit , and the only free parameter was the outer disk radius @xmath22 .",
    "we found that @xmath23 and 4.5@xmath21 for a0620@xmath000 and xte j1118 + 480 , respectively , were required to fit the excess emission ( see figure  [ fig : bd ] ) .",
    "having an orbital period of 1160.8 days , the identified m6iii companion in gx 1 + 4 can not fill its roche lobe ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this explains the lack of emission from an accretion disk in its broad - band optical and near - ir spectrum .",
    "however the wise fluxes clearly indicate the excess emission from the source . using the model above ,",
    "in which the neutron star primary and companion masses of 1.35 and 1.0 @xmath12 , respectively , and @xmath24 were assumed @xcite , a circumbinary disk with an outer radius of 2@xmath21 can provide an acceptable fit to the excess emission although the model fluxes ( blue dashed curve in figure  [ fig : bd ] ) at w1 and w2 bands are slightly lower than the observed . a smaller than 1.7@xmath21 inner disk radius is required in order to eliminate the deviation . since a mass - ejecting outflow is expected from a giant star and optical spectroscopy",
    "has suggested the presence of a @xmath25 cm radius gas envelope around the binary @xcite , we also tested to fit the excess emission with a model of an optically thin dust shell ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "we simplified the model by assuming the temperature of 1200  k at the inner edge of the dust shell ( the dust sublimation temperature ) , the emission efficiency of dust grains @xmath26 , the number density distribution of the dust shell @xmath27 , where @xmath19 is the radius , and thus temperature function @xmath28 .",
    "the model emission from such a dust shell is displayed in figure  [ fig : bd ] , and it provides an acceptable description to the excess emission too and is able to eliminate the deviation at w1 and w2 bands when the circumbinary disk model was considered .",
    "the total number of dust grains in the shell is @xmath291.8@xmath30 , resulting in a mass of 10@xmath31 when assuming 3  g  @xmath32 for the density of grain material ( grain radius of 0.1  @xmath2 m was assumed ) .",
    "the mass value is a reasonable estimate for the dust around a giant star .",
    "the neutron star lmxb 4u 0614 + 091 was detected by wise at its first three bands .",
    "this binary has been well studied from previous targeted _ spitzer _ observations and its ir emission has been identified to be from a jet @xcite .",
    "the wise fluxes at w1 , w2 , and w3 were 0.13@xmath330.01 , 0.15@xmath330.02 , and 0.61@xmath330.14 mjy , respectively . given that the source was faint to wise",
    ", we consider the wise measurements are consistent with that of _ spitzer _ ( e.g. , @xcite ) , although flux variability is also expected for a jet . since detailed , simultaneous multi - band studies of the binary and its jet emission have been presented by @xcite , no further data analysis was conducted for the source .",
    "the black hole binary gx 339@xmath04 has long been known to have a jet ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . combining with quasi - simultaneous data of a large wavelength range from radio to x - ray",
    ", @xcite have already analyzed the wise data for the binary in detail and showed that the wise band emission was from a jet of the binary system .",
    "on the basis of their broad - band spectra , the companion stars in the lmxbs cen x-4 , 4u 1700 + 24 , 3a 1954 + 319 , and cyg x-2 were identified to have been detected by wise , with no excess emission found at the wise bands .",
    "the broad - band spectra are shown in figure  [ fig : com ] . among them , the w2 fluxes of 4u  1700 + 24 and 3a 1954 + 319 deviate from the stellar model spectra significantly .",
    "however this is due to saturation of the two sources in the wise w1 and w2 images .",
    "they were very bright ( @xmath34 mag ; table  [ tab : sum ] ) , and although large flux uncertainties at the two bands ( see table  [ tab : sum ] ) reflects photometry of the saturated sources , the broad - band spectra indicate that their w2 fluxes were likely overestimated by wise photometry .    for 3a 1954 + 319 ,",
    "the companion star was classified as a m4 - 5iii giant from optical spectroscopy by @xcite . using the @xmath35-band magnitude given in the usno - b1.0 catalogue @xcite and @xmath36 for an m4iii star , @xcite derived @xmath37 and thus estimated a source distance of @xmath381.7  kpc .",
    "we checked the usno - b1.0 catalogue and found that the only measurement for the source is @xmath39 , which is not consistent with the value given in @xcite .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : com ] , the @xmath35-band flux is an order of magnitude lower than the model spectrum , which may be due to large uncertainties in photometric measurements in the usno - b1.0 catalogue .",
    "the extinction towards this high galactic latitude ( @xmath40 ) source is estimated to be very low ( @xmath41 ; @xcite ) , hard to explain the discrepancy . in any case , from matching an m4 giant model spectrum to the near - ir 2mass and wise data , we found that the ratio of the stellar radius @xmath35 to distance @xmath42 is @xmath43 , and estimated @xmath440.67  kpc when @xmath45 .    for cyg x-2 ,",
    "a spectral type of a9 for the companion was identified by @xcite .",
    "we used a model spectrum of such a giant star to fit the broad - band spectrum , and the model describes the observed ir data points well . since cyg x-2 is a bright , persistent x - ray source , in which an accretion disk exists , the optical fluxes contain emission from the disk and thus are above the model spectrum .",
    "the w3 flux is above the model spectrum , but we note that the measured magnitude , 11.95 , is close to the limiting magnitude of wise at the w3 band @xcite and the deviation is likely due to the large uncertainties in the flux measurements of very faint sources .",
    "the @xmath46 ratio we obtained was 2.5@xmath47 . using the masses of 1.71 and 0.58 @xmath12 for the neutron star and companion @xcite ,",
    "respectively , the roche lobe radius of the companion is approximately 7.3  @xmath48 , which implies a source distance of 6.7 kpc .",

    "simultaneous , multiwavelength measurements are particularly required for these two sources in order to conduct data analysis and to determine the presence of excess ir emission and the origin if the excesses are found . in figure  [ fig : pec ] , their broad - band spectra , which are not simultaneous data , are shown .    for sco x-1 ,",
    "its companion star likely has a mass of 0.42 @xmath12 when a 1.4 @xmath12 neutron star is assumed ( @xmath49 ; @xcite ) , and probably has a spectral type of earlier than g5 @xcite . at a distance of 2.8 kpc @xcite ,",
    "such a star has little contribution to the optical fluxes of the source .",
    "however given the large x - ray luminosity ( @xmath50 erg s@xmath15 ; e.g. , @xcite ) , we may estimate the irradiated temperature for the companion and it would be of the order of 25,00030,000 k , depending on the albedo of the companion star . the model spectrum of this strongly irradiated star and that of an irradiated accretion disk @xcite are shown in figure  [ fig : pec ] .",
    "the addition of the two spectra is able to describe the optical and near - ir @xmath51-band data but significantly deviates from the wise and _ spitzer _ data points ( the latter are from @xcite ) , suggesting the need of an additional component . given that sco x-1 is known to have a radio jet ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we tested to add a power - law component to eliminate the deviation , and found that @xmath52 could provide an acceptable fit .",
    "however , the power - law component does not connect directly to the radio emission from sco x-1 , which was found to be , for example , in a range of 859 mjy at 1.28 ghz @xcite .",
    "a rising , @xmath53 spectrum would be needed in order to connect the _ spitzer _",

    "we realized that since the data points shown in figure  [ fig : pec ] were not simultaneously obtained , an alternative explanation for the discrepancy is that during either the wise or _",
    "observations , whose flux measurements are consistent with each other , the radio emission would have been much faint if the ir emission had arisen from the jet .    for her x-1 , by studying its ultraviolet spectra , @xcite found that a model that contains a companion of late a spectral type plus an x - ray irradiated disk could provide a good fit .",
    "here we used the binary parameters estimated by @xcite , the masses of 1.5  @xmath12 and 2.3  @xmath12 for the neutron star and companion , respectively , and found that the broad - band data basically could be described by the model emission .",
    "probably because our data were not simultaneous and the contribution from the companion was underestimated ( emission from a late type a star with a roche - lobe radius of 3.85 @xmath48 was used ) , the distance had to be 5.8 kpc , lower than 6.6@xmath330.4  kpc estimated by @xcite . in any case our analysis shows that the ir data points are consistent with being a rayleigh - jeans tail of thermal emission and no excess emission was found at the ir bands .",

    "[ fig : pec ] , the broad - band optical and near - ir data from @xcite are shown , which were obtained in 2012 nearly simultaneously .",
    "the model fit , produced from a thin , steady - state accretion disk , is also from @xcite , and can generally describe the source s emission in the range of from ultraviolet to near - ir wavelengths .",
    "the deviation starts from near - ir @xmath54 band , which was noted by @xcite , and it is so significant at the wise bands that an additional component is clearly needed . the binary is known to have a jet @xcite .",
    "the radio observation that was closest to the wise observations was carried out in 2009 june , which found a flux of 0.4 mjy at 8.4 ghz @xcite .",
    "a power - law spectrum @xmath55 , presumably from the jet and connects to the radio datum , can explain the ir excesses , but is not allowed by the wise w3 band flux upper limit .",
    "again like the sco x-1 case , in order to connect to the radio data , a rising spectrum from mid - ir ( at the wavelength of @xmath3812 @xmath2 m ) is needed .",
    "alternatively , a circumbinary debris disk may also explain the ir excesses .",
    "however , since the companion star was not seen in the emission from the binary , no constraints on the disk temperature can be set .",
    "to produce the ir spectrum of the disk shown in figure  [ fig : pec ] , the temperature at 1.7@xmath21 was 2500  k , too high to be the inner edge of a dust disk . a slightly larger inner disk radius is needed .",

    "[ fig : vdis ] ]    for the candidate circumbinary disk systems , @xcite have proposed the jet scenario to explain the excess ir emission seen in a0620@xmath000 and xte j1118 + 480 . given the ubiquity of the presence of jets in the lmxbs @xcite , the jet scenario is also plausible .",
    "detection of dust signatures such as the pah emission features seen in grs  1915 + 105 is needed in order to verify the presence of a dust disk . on the other hand , the case of grs  1915 + 105 , a well - known microquasar ,",
    "has shown that an lmxb can harbor both a circumbinary disk and a jet .",
    "thus the two binaries could also have the both .",
    "for gx  1 + 4 , although we can not determine if the excess emission arises from a dust shell or a circumbinary disk , the wise detection of the excesses has revealed another interesting aspect for this binary : the giant - star companion s significant mass loss is also observable at ir wavelengths .",

    "the distribution of the 12 lmxbs with the wise counterparts , not including grs 1915 + 105 due to extremely high extinction , is shown as the filled histogram .",
    "it is not surprising that the wise - detected sources are among the brightest .",
    "the two exceptions are at 1819 mag , which are 4u 0614 + 091 and gx 1 + 4 , the first due to the rising spectrum of its jet @xcite and the latter due to high extinction ( table  [ tab : prop ] ) . from the statistics based on this small sample ,",
    "while the bias towards the intrinsically bright x - ray sources ( such as sco x-1 and her x-1 ) exists , we may suspect that more than half of the lmxbs would have non - stellar ir emission , due to the presence of a jet , a circumbinary debris disk , or the both .",
