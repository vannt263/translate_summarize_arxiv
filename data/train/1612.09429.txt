    "should be solved in coordinate space or coordinate - equivalent space . for the spherical system ,",
    "the conventional shooting method works quite well @xcite , which however is rather complicated for the deformed system  @xcite .",
    "therefore the dirac woods - saxon basis expansion method was developed  @xcite and has been widely used to solve the deformed dirac equation  @xcite , which , however , is highly computational time consuming for the heavy system .    imaginary time method ( itm )  @xcite is a powerful approach for the self - consistent mean - field calculations in a three - dimensional ( 3d ) coordinate space .",

    "<S> a new method to solve dirac equation in 3d lattice is proposed , in which the variational collapse problem is avoided by inverse hamiltonian method and the fermion doubling problem is avoided by performing spatial derivatives in momentum space with the help of discrete fourier transform , i.e. , spectral method . </S>",
    "<S> this method is demonstrated in solving the dirac equation for a given spherical potential in 3d lattice . in comparison with the results obtained by the shooting method , the differences in single particle energy are smaller than @xmath0  mev , and the densities are almost identical , which demonstrate the high accuracy of the present method . the results obtained by applying this method without any modification to solve the dirac equations for an axial deformed , non - axial deformed , octupole deformed potential are provided and discussed . </S>"
