    "ordinary matter around us consists of neutral atoms , in which electrically charged nuclei are bound with electrons .",
    "few years ago we proposed that in the similar way the dark matter consists of dark atoms , in which new stable charged particles are bound by ordinary coulomb interaction ( see @xcite for review and references ) . in order to avoid anomalous isotopes overproduction , stable particles with charge -1 ( and corresponding antiparticles ) , as tera - particles @xcite ,",
    "should be absent @xcite , so that stable negatively charged particles should have charge -2 only .",
    "elementary particle frames for heavy stable -2 charged species are provided by : ( a ) stable `` antibaryons '' @xmath5 formed by anti-@xmath6 quark of fourth generation @xcite ( b ) ac - leptons @xcite , predicted in the extension @xcite of standard model , based on the approach of almost - commutative geometry @xcite .",
    "( c ) technileptons and anti - technibaryons @xcite in the framework of walking technicolor models ( wtc ) @xcite .",
    "( d ) finally , stable charged clusters @xmath7 of ( anti)quarks @xmath8 of 5th family can follow from the approach , unifying spins and charges @xcite .",
    "since all these models also predict corresponding + 2 charge antiparticles , cosmological scenario should provide mechanism of their suppression , what can naturally take place in the asymmetric case , corresponding to excess of -2 charge species , @xmath0 .",
    "then their positively charged antiparticles can effectively annihilate in the early universe .",
    "if new stable species belong to non - trivial representations of electroweak su(2 ) group , sphaleron transitions at high temperatures can provide the relationship between baryon asymmetry and excess of -2 charge stable species , as it was demonstrated in the case of wtc @xcite .",
    "after it is formed in the standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( sbbn ) , @xmath9 screens the @xmath0 charged particles in composite @xmath10 _ o - helium",
    "_ `` atoms '' @xcite .    in all the proposed forms of o - helium",
    ", @xmath0 behaves either as lepton or as specific `` heavy quark cluster '' with strongly suppressed hadronic interaction .",
    "therefore interaction with matter of o - helium is determined by nuclear interaction of its helium shell .",
    "these neutral primordial nuclear interacting objects contribute to the modern dark matter density and play the role of a nontrivial form of strongly interacting dark matter @xcite .",
    "the qualitative picture of ohe cosmological evolution @xcite was recently reviewed in @xcite .",
    "here we concentrate on some open questions in the properties of o - helium dark atoms and their interaction with matter , which are crucial for our explanation of the puzzles of dark matter searches .",
    "the properties of ohe interaction with matter are determined first of all by the structure of ohe atom that follows from the general analysis of the bound states of non - hadronic negatively charged particles @xmath11 with nuclei in a simple model @xcite , in which the nucleus is regarded as a sphere with uniform charge density .",
    "spin dependence is not taken into account so that both the particle and nucleus are considered as scalars .",
    "variational treatment of the problem @xcite gives for @xmath12 the coulomb binding energy like in hydrogen atom , while at @xmath13 for large nuclei @xmath11 is inside nuclear radius and the harmonic oscillator approximation is valid .",
    "here @xmath14 is the fine structure constant , @xmath15 is the nuclear radius , @xmath16 is the electric charge of nucleus and @xmath17 is the electric charge of negatively charged particle @xmath11 with the mass @xmath18 .",
    "the reduced mass is @xmath19 and for @xmath20 is @xmath21 .    in the case of ohe ( @xmath22 , @xmath23,@xmath24 )",
    "@xmath25 what proves its bohr - atom - like structure , assumed in our earlier papers @xcite . however , the size of he , rotating around @xmath0 in this bohr atom , turns out to be of the order and even a bit larger than the radius @xmath26 of its bohr orbit , and the corresponding correction to the binding energy due to non - point - like charge distribution in he is significant .",
    "the variational approach @xcite gives in the limit of small @xmath27 the expression for binding energy @xmath28 therefore the hydrogen - like bohr atom binding energy of ohe @xmath29 is corrected for helium final size effect as follows : @xmath30    bohr atom like structure of ohe seems to provide a possibility to use the results of atomic physics for description of ohe interaction with matter .",
    "however , the situation is much more complicated .",
    "ohe atom is similar to the hydrogen , in which electron is hundreds times heavier , than proton , so that it is proton shell that surrounds `` electron nucleus '' .",
    "nuclei that interact with such `` hydrogen '' would interact first with strongly interacting `` protonic '' shell and such interaction can hardly be treated in the framework of perturbation theory .",
    "moreover in the description of ohe interaction the account for the finite size of he , which is even larger than the radius of bohr orbit , is important .",
    "one should consider , therefore , the analysis , presented below , as only a first step approaching true nuclear physics of ohe .",
    "the approach of @xcite assumes the following picture of ohe interaction with nuclei : ohe is a neutral atom in the ground state , perturbed by coulomb and nuclear forces of the approaching nucleus .",
    "the sign of ohe polarization changes with the distance : at larger distances stark - like effect takes place - the coulomb force of nucleus polarizes ohe so that he is put behind @xmath0 and nucleus is attracted by the induced dipole moment of ohe , while as soon as the perturbation by nuclear force starts to dominate the nucleus polarizes ohe in the opposite way so that he is virtually situated more close to the nucleus , resulting in a dipole coulomb barrier for helium shell in its merging with the approaching nucleus .",
    "correct mathematical description of this change of ohe polarization , induced by the simultaneous action of coulomb force and strongly nonhomogeneous nuclear force needs special treatment . for the moment we use the analogy with stark effect in the ground state of hydrogen atom and approximate the form of dipole coulomb barrier by the coulomb barrier in the theory of @xmath14 decay , corrected for the coulomb attraction of nucleus by @xmath0 .",
    "when helium is completely merged with the nucleus the interaction is reduced to the oscillatory potential of @xmath0 with homogeneously charged merged nucleus with the charge @xmath31 .",
    "therefore ohe - nucleus potential has qualitative feature , presented on fig .",
    "[ pic1 ] by solid line . to simplify the solution of schrodinger equation the potential was approximated in @xcite by a rectangular wells and wall , shown by dashed lines on fig .",
    "the existence of potential barrier @xmath32 in region ii causes suppression of reactions with transition of ohe - nucleus system to levels in the potential well @xmath33 of the region",
    "i. it results in the dominance of elastic scattering while transitions to levels in the shallow well @xmath34 ( regions iii - iv ) should dominate in reactions of ohe - nucleus capture .",
    "+    schrodinger equation for ohe - nucleus system is reduced to the problem of relative motion for the reduced mass @xmath35 in the spherically symmetric potential , presented on fig .",
    "if the mass of ohe @xmath36 , center of mass of ohe - nucleus system approximately coincides with the position of @xmath0 and the reduced mass is approximately equal to the mass of nucleus @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is its atomic weight .",
    "solutions of schrodinger equation for each of the four regions , indicated on fig .",
    "[ pic1 ] , are given in textbooks ( see e.g.@xcite ) and their sewing determines the condition , under which a low - energy ohe - nucleus bound state appears in the region iii .    strictly speaking , we should deal with a three - body problem for the system of he , nucleus and @xmath0 and the correct quantum mechanical description should be based on the cylindrical and not spherical symmetry . in the lack of the exact solution of the problem we present here qualitative arguments for the existence and properties of ohe - nucleus bound states .",
    "the evident consequence of the o - helium dark matter is its inevitable presence in the terrestrial matter , which appears opaque to o - helium and stores all its in - falling flux .",
    "after they fall down terrestrial surface , the in - falling ohe particles are effectively slowed down due to collisions with matter , which are dominantly elastic as follows from our description of ohe - nucleus interaction .",
    "then they drift , sinking down towards the center of the earth with velocity @xcitev = 80 s_3 a_med^1/2 /.",
    "[ dif]here @xmath39 is the average atomic weight in terrestrial surface matter , @xmath40 is the number density of terrestrial atomic nuclei , @xmath41 is the rate of nuclear collisions and @xmath42 .    in underground detectors ,",
    "ohe `` atoms '' are slowed down to thermal energies and give rise to energy transfer @xmath43 , far below the threshold for direct dark matter detection .",
    "it makes this form of dark matter insensitive to the severe cdms @xcite and xenon100 @xcite constraints .",
    "however , ohe induced processes in the matter of underground detectors can result in observable effects .",
    "these effects strongly depend on the details of the ohe interaction with nuclei .",
    "it should be noted that the nuclear cross section of the o - helium interaction with matter escapes the severe constraints @xcite on strongly interacting dark matter particles ( simps ) @xcite imposed by the xqc experiment @xcite .",
    "therefore , a special strategy of direct o - helium search is needed , as it was proposed in @xcite .    near the earth s surface",
    ", the o - helium abundance is determined by the equilibrium between the in - falling and down - drifting fluxes .    at a depth",
    "@xmath44 below the earth s surface , the drift timescale is @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the drift velocity ( [ dif ] ) and @xmath18 is the mass of o - helium .",
    "it means that the change of the incoming flux , caused by the motion of the earth along its orbit , should lead at the depth @xmath47 to the corresponding change in the equilibrium underground concentration of @xmath48 on the timescale @xmath49 .",
    "the equilibrium concentration , which is established in the matter of underground detectors at this timescale , is given by @xcite @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 is the period of earth s orbital motion around sun and @xmath53 is the phase .",
    "so , there is a averaged concentration given by @xmath54 and the annual modulation of concentration characterized by the amplitude @xmath55 here @xmath56 is velocity ( 220 km / s ) of solar system in the galaxy , @xmath57 is velocity ( 29.5 km / s ) of earth s orbital motion around sun and @xmath58 is the local density of o - helium dark matter .",
    "the explanation @xcite of the results of dama / nai @xcite and dama / libra @xcite experiments is based on the idea that ohe , slowed down in the matter of detector , can form a few kev bound state with nucleus , in which ohe is situated * beyond * the nucleus .",
    "therefore the positive result of these experiments is explained by annual modulation in reaction rate of radiative capture of ohe @xmath59+\\gamma \\label{heeaz}\\ ] ] by nuclei in dama detector .",
    "solution of schrodinger equation determines the condition , under which a low - energy ohe - nucleus bound state appears in the shallow well of the region iii and the range of nuclear parameters was found @xcite , at which ohe - sodium binding energy is in the interval 2 - 4 kev .",
    "the rate of radiative capture of ohe by nuclei can be calculated @xcite with the use of the analogy with the radiative capture of neutron by proton with the account for : i ) absence of m1 transition that follows from conservation of orbital momentum and ii ) suppression of e1 transition in the case of ohe .",
    "since ohe is isoscalar , isovector e1 transition can take place in ohe - nucleus system only due to effect of isospin nonconservation , which can be measured by the factor @xmath60 , corresponding to the difference of mass of neutron , @xmath61 , and proton , @xmath62 , relative to the mass of nucleon , @xmath63 . in the result",
    "the rate of ohe radiative capture by nucleus with atomic number @xmath38 and charge @xmath16 to the energy level @xmath64 in the medium with temperature @xmath52 is given by @xcite @xmath65    formation of ohe - nucleus bound system leads to energy release of its binding energy , detected as ionization signal . in the context of our approach the existence of annual modulations of this signal in the range 2 - 6",
    "kev and absence of such effect at energies above 6 kev means that binding energy @xmath66 of na - ohe system in dama experiment should not exceed 6 kev , being in the range 2 - 4 kev .",
    "the amplitude of annual modulation of ionization signal can reproduce the result of dama / nai and dama / libra experiments for @xmath67 .",
    "the account for energy resolution in dama experiments @xcite can explain the observed energy distribution of the signal from monochromatic photon ( with @xmath67 ) emitted in ohe radiative capture .    at the corresponding nuclear parameters there is no binding of ohe with iodine and thallium @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the results of dama experiment exhibit also absence of annual modulations at the energy of mev - tens mev .",
    "energy release in this range should take place , if ohe - nucleus system comes to the deep level inside the nucleus .",
    "this transition implies tunneling through dipole coulomb barrier and is suppressed below the experimental limits . for the chosen range of nuclear parameters , reproducing the results of dama / nai and dama / libra , the results @xcite indicate that there are no levels in the ohe - nucleus systems for heavy nuclei . in particular",
    ", there are no such levels in xe , what seem to prevent direct comparison with dama results in xenon100 experiment @xcite .",
    "the existence of such level in ge and the comparison with the results of cdms @xcite and cogent @xcite experiments need special study . according to @xcite ohe",
    "should bind with o and ca , what is of interest for interpretation of the signal , observed in cresst - ii experiment @xcite .    in the thermal equilibrium ohe capture rate",
    "is proportional to the temperature .",
    "therefore it looks like it is suppressed in cryogenic detectors by a factor of order @xmath68 .",
    "however , for the size of cryogenic devices less , than few tens meters , ohe gas in them has the thermal velocity of the surrounding terrestrial matter and this velocity dominates in the relative velocity of ohe - nucleus system .",
    "it gives the suppression relative to room temperature only @xmath69 .",
    "then the rate of ohe radiative capture in cryogenic detectors is given by eq.([radcap ] ) , in which room temperature @xmath52 is multiplied by factor @xmath70 .",
    "note that in the case of @xmath71 in cogent experiment relative velocity is determined by the thermal velocity of germanium nuclei , what leads to enhancement relative to cryogenic germanium detectors .",
    "the cosmological dark matter can be formed by stable heavy charged particles bound in neutral dark atoms by ordinary coulomb attraction .",
    "analysis of the cosmological data and atomic composition of the universe gives the constrains on the particle charge showing that only @xmath72 charged constituents , being trapped by primordial helium in neutral o - helium states , can avoid the problem of overproduction of the anomalous isotopes of chemical elements , which are severely constrained by observations .",
    "this scenario can be realized in different frameworks , in particular in minimal walking technicolor model or in the approach unifying spin and charges and contains distinct features , by which the present explanation can be distinguished from other recent approaches to this problem @xcite ( see also review and more references in @xcite ) .",
    "it should be noted that o - helium , being an @xmath14-particle with screened electric charge , can catalyze nuclear transformations , which can influence primordial light element abundance and cause primordial heavy element formation .",
    "it is especially important for quantitative estimation of role of ohe in big bang nucleosynthesis and in stellar evolution .",
    "these effects need a special detailed and complicated study and this work is under way .",
    "our first steps in the approach to ohe nuclear physics seem to support the qualitative picture of ohe cosmological evolution described in @xcite and based on the dominant role of elastic collisions in ohe interaction with baryonic matter .",
    "cosmological model of o - helium dark matter can even explain puzzles of direct dark matter searches .",
    "the explanation is based on the mechanism of low energy binding of ohe with nuclei .",
    "we have found @xcite that within the uncertainty of nuclear physics parameters there exists their range at which ohe binding energy with sodium is equal to 4 kev and there is no such binding with iodine and thallium .",
    "annual modulation of the energy release in the radiative capture of ohe to this level explains the results of dama / nai and dama / libra experiments .    with the account for high sensitivity of our results to the values of uncertain nuclear parameters and for the approximations , made in our calculations ,",
    "the presented results can be considered only as an illustration of the possibility to explain effects in underground detectors by ohe binding with intermediate nuclei . however , even at the present level of our studies we can make a conclusion that effects of such binding should strongly differ in detectors with the content , different from nai , and can be absent in detectors with very light ( e.g. @xmath73 ) and heavy nuclei ( like xenon )",
    ". therefore test of results of dama / nai and dama / libra experiments by other experimental groups can become a very nontrivial task .",
    "recent indications to positive result in the matter of cresst detector @xcite , in which ohe binding is expected together with absence of signal in xenon detector @xcite , may qualitatively favor the presented approach . for the same chemical content",
    "an order of magnitude suppression in cryogenic detectors can explain why indications to positive effect in cogent experiment @xcite can be compatible with the constraints of cdms experiment .",
    "an inevitable consequence of the proposed explanation is appearance in the matter of underground detectors anomalous superheavy isotopes , having the mass roughly by @xmath74 larger , than ordinary isotopes of the corresponding elements .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the framework of the presented approach positive result of experimental search for wimps by effect of their nuclear recoil would be a signature for a multicomponent nature of dark matter .",
    "such ohe+wimps multicomponent dark matter scenarios naturally follow from ac model @xcite and can be realized in models of walking technicolor @xcite .",
    "the presented approach sheds new light on the physical nature of dark matter .",
    "specific properties of dark atoms and their constituents are challenging for the experimental search .",
    "the development of quantitative description of ohe interaction with matter confronted with the experimental data will provide the complete test of the composite dark matter model .",
    "it challenges search for stable double charged particles at accelerators and cosmic rays as direct experimental probe for charged constituents of dark atoms of dark matter .",
