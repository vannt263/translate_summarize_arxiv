    "over the last couple of decades there has been a continuing interest in the stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) @xcite .",
    "the simplest situation is the adiabatic passage in a linear lambda system @xcite containing a single dark ( uncoupled ) state which is immune to the atom - light coupling .",
    "if atomic initial and final states are the ground states representing the dark states of the system , the atom can be transferred between these two states by slowly changing the relative intensity of the laser pulses . when the adiabatic passage is slow enough ,",
    "the excited state is only slightly populated and thus the losses are minimum . the analysis has been extended for the stirap process in the tripod system characterized by two dark states @xcite .",
    "this enables to create a quantum superposition of metastable states out of a single initial state in a robust and coherent way @xcite .",
    "the schemes involving more atomic and molecular levels were also proposed for creation a superposition of states @xcite as well as for experimental control of excitation flow @xcite .",
    "recently the treatment was further extended to the non - linear lambda @xcite and tripod @xcite schemes .",
    "usually the stirap is based on the adiabatic approximation . however , one has to distinguish between the adiabatic approximation and the adiabatic reduction of dynamic systems . in quantum mechanics ,",
    "a closed quantum system is said to undergo adiabatic dynamics if its hilbert space can be decomposed into decoupled schrdinger eigenspaces with distinct , time - continuous , and non - crossing instantaneous eigenvalues of hamiltonian . on the other hand",
    "an open quantum system is said to undergo adiabatic dynamics if its hilbert - schmidt space can be decomposed into decoupled lindblad - jordan eigenspaces with distinct , time - continuous , and non - crossing instantaneous eigenvalues of the lindblad superoperator @xcite .",
    "the system is called adiabatically approximated if the error term in the schrdinger equation ( for closed systems ) or in the master equation ( for open systems ) is much less than the diagonalysed part ; i.e. one may neglect the non - diagonal terms in order to get an adiabatically approximated version of the system .",
    "note that in the presence of fast driven oscillations some additional conditions ( in addition to the slowness of the evolution of the hamiltonian ) have to be imposed @xcite .",
    "another procedure is the adiabatic elimination of decaying degrees of freedom .",
    "it is related to the dynamic systems in which some degrees of freedom may decay . in accordance with this definition ,",
    "these degrees of freedom may be adiabatically eliminated by solving the corresponding algebraic equations ; the r.h.s . of decaying equations",
    "are set to be equal to zero .",
    "consequently , one obtains the dependencies of decaying variables on the remaining ones .",
    "if there are several decaying variables , one may eliminate them one by one , starting from the fastest variable , and finishing with the slowest one .",
    "such a procedure can be found e.g. in the book by haken @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to perform a stability analysis of the dark states in the adiabatic passage for the linear and non - linear lambda and tripod systems .",
    "the analysis sets limits to the adiabatic reduction of the systems .",
    "moreover , we have revealed that in all the considered systems , the stability properties of the dark states are similar , namely , there are three time intervals with different number of the negative real parts of the jacobians .",
    "this suggests that the corresponding linear and non - linear systems have equal possibilities of adiabatic reduction .",
    "although the linear lambda @xcite and tripod systems @xcite have been substantially studied in the literature , here we apply our treatment also to these linear setups in order to facilitate the subsequent analysis of the non - linear systems .",
    "the non - linear lambda system can be realized in the bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) via photoassociation ( pa ) from a dissociated ( quasicontinuum ) atomic state to the ground molecular state in the presence of the intermediate molecular state @xcite .",
    "the aim of the quantum control is to transfer the whole population from the dissociated atomic to the ground molecular state .",
    "one thus creates ultracold molecules by associating cold atoms @xcite . in this case",
    "the dark state is a generalisation of that for the linear systems . in the linear case",
    ", the dark state is defined as a superposition of the initial and target ground atomic states which corresponds to the zero eigenergy of the system hamiltonian .",
    "the same dark state may be also defined as a steady state solution of the schrdinger equation .",
    "if we consider the nonlinear system , we can again define the dark state as a steady state @xcite of the equations of motion following from the heisenberg equation .",
    "in the nonlinear systems , the behaviour of the dark state reproduces that in the linear systems although the superposition is missing now .",
    "we thus get the nonlinear version of stirap : the entire population is distributed among the steady state probability amplitudes of the initial atomic and the target molecular state . at the beginning the whole population is atomic , whereas at the end it is in the ground molecular state .    differently from the traditional stirap in an atomic lambda system ,",
    "the atom - molecule stirap contains nonlinearities originating from the conversion process of atoms to molecules , as well as from the interparticle interactions described by the non - linear mean - field contributions .",
    "the existence of such nonlinearities makes it difficult to analyse the adiabaticity of the atom - molecule conversion systems due to the absence of the superposition principle . in the stirap",
    ", the linear instability could make the quantum evolution deviate from the dark state rapidly even in adiabatic limit @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is important to avoid such an instability for the efficiency of the stirap .    the non - linear tripod system can be realized in the pa with two target states involved .",
    "specifically , one may consider the atom - molecule transition in ultracold quantum gases via pa .",
    "it was first considered in @xcite where the second order dynamic system was derived that parametrizes the solution evolving on the dark state manifold .",
    "however the stability of the solution moving along the manifold was not considered .",
    "therefore we shall check the stability of this solution , i.e. see whether the nearby solutions are attracted back to this manifold .    the adiabatic theory for non - linear quantum systems",
    "was first discussed by liu _",
    "@xcite who obtained the adiabatic conditions and adiabatic invariants by representing the non - linear heisenberg equation in terms of an effective classical hamiltonian .",
    "_ @xcite and ling _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite extended such an adiabatic theory to the atom - dimer conversion system by linking the nonadiabaticity with the population growth in the collective excitations of the dark state .",
    "specifically , it was shown that a passage is adiabatic if the solution remains in a close proximity to the dark state .",
    "itin and watanabe @xcite presented an improved adiabatic condition by applying methods of the classical hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "the atom - molecule dark - state technique in the stirap was theoretically generalized to create more complex homonuclear or heteronuclear molecule trimers or tetramers @xcite .",
    "an important issue is the instability and the adiabatic property of the dark state in such complex systems .",
    "for example , the dynamics of a non - linear lambda system describing bec of atoms and diatomic molecules was studied and a model of the dark state with collisional interactions was investigated @xcite .",
    "it was shown that non - linear instabilities can be used for precise determination of the scattering lengths .",
    "on the other hand , the transfer of atoms to molecules via stirap is robust with respect to detunings , @xmath0 nonlinearities , and small asymmetries between the peak strengths of the two raman lasers @xcite .",
    "the complete conversion is destroyed by spatial effects unless the time scale of the coupling is much faster than the pulse duration .",
    "in addition , a set of robust and efficient techniques has been introduced @xcite to coherently manipulate and transport neutral atoms based on three - level atom optics ( tlao ) .",
    "it is to be noted that the dynamics of an adiabatic sweep through a feshbach resonance was studied @xcite in a quantum gas of fermionic atoms .",
    "an interesting application of bec is an atom diode with a directed motion of atoms @xcite .",
    "another example of bec was presented in @xcite where it was shown that the two - colour pa of fermionic atoms into bosonic molecules via a dark - state transition results in a significant reduction of the group velocity of the photoassociation field .",
    "this is similar to the electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) in atomic systems characterized by the three - levels of the lambda type .",
    "in addition the coupled non - linear schrdinger equations have been considered @xcite to describe the atomic becs interacting with the molecular condensates through the stirap loaded in an external potential .",
    "the results have shown that there is a class of external potentials where the exact dark solutions can be formed . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that it is possible to perform qubit rotations by stirap , and proposed a rotation procedure in which the resulting state corresponds to a rotation of the qubit , with the axis and angle of rotation determined uniquely by the parameters of the laser fields .    a relevant tool for studying the adiabaticity is the adiabatic fidelity .",
    "it indicates how far is the current solution of the system from the dark state .",
    "have generalized the definition of fidelity for the non - linear system @xcite .",
    "they have studied the dynamics and adiabaticity of the population transfer for atom - molecule three - level lambda system on a stirap .",
    "it was also discussed how to achieve higher adiabatic fidelity for the dark state through optimizing the external parameters of the stirap . in the subsequent paper @xcite meng _",
    "_ have used the same definition of adiabatic fidelity in order to discuss the adiabatic evolution of the dark state in a non - linear atom - trimer conversion due to a stirap .",
    "it is to be noted that ivanov and vitanov have recently proposed novel high - fidelity composite pulses for the most important single - qubit operations @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we analyse the problem of reducing the dimension ( simplifying ) in the linear / non - linear three- and four - level models .",
    "this procedure is called the adiabatic reduction , and its validity is closely related with the theory of adiabaticity discussed above . the exact three- or four - level system",
    "may be adiabatically reduced to a system with lower dimension .",
    "the question that arises is how many dynamic variables can be eliminated ? in other words , what is the effective dimension of the system ?",
    "the answer lies in the eigenvalues of the jacobian computed at the dark state .",
    "the zero real parts of eigenvalues mean that in some directions the nearby solutions are behaving neutrally in respect to the dark state .",
    "the negative real parts in turn mean that some directions are stable , and the nearby solutions converge towards the dark state .",
    "therefore we conclude that the number of negative real parts dictates the number of variables that can be adiabatically eliminated ( see e.g. @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", the number of zero real parts yields the effective dimension of the system .",
    "note that we find the non - zero eigenvalues analytically from quadratic characteristic equations .",
    "one of the central issues in our work is the presence of dissipation in all the considered systems .",
    "the non - zero losses make the adiabatic reduction easier to implement since the term of losses acts as a `` controller '' that attracts the nearby solutions towards the dark state .",
    "however , vitanov and stenholm have demonstrated that the losses cause also the decrease of transfer efficiency to the target state @xcite .",
    "this decrease can be circumvented by higher pulse areas since the range of decay rates over which the transfer efficiency remains high , has been found to be proportional to the squared pulse area ( see ( 10 ) in @xcite ) . in the subsequent developments the effect of spontaneous emission on the population transfer efficiency in stirap was explored for the linear lambda @xcite and tripod @xcite systems . in addition , renzoni _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have considered the coherent - population - trapping ( cpt ) phenomenon in a thermal sodium atomic beam .",
    "it was demonstrated that cpt may be realized on those open transitions with an efficiency decreasing with the amount of spontaneous emission towards external states . on the other hand , here we concentrate on the stability issues of the linear and non - linear lambda and tripod systems with the losses .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in next two sections",
    "we shall consider the stability of the linear lambda and tripod systems with losses .",
    "in sections [ sec:4 ] and [ sec:5 ] the analysis is extended to the non - linear lambda and tripod systems . in section [ sec:6 ]",
    "we discuss the role of the one - photon detuning followed by the conclusions in section [ sec:7 ] .",
    "in this section we shall provide a summary on the stirap in the linear lambda system with losses studied in @xcite followed by the stability analysis of the system .",
    "the three - level lambda system is shown in figure [ fig_l_scheme ] .",
    "the excited state @xmath1 is coupled to two ground states @xmath2 and @xmath3 with the coupling strengths denoted as @xmath4 and @xmath5 to form a lambda scheme .",

    "denoting the amplitudes of the three - level state as @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 respectively , we get the schrdinger equation : @xmath12the normalization reads : @xmath13 where equality holds for initial time .",
    "because of losses ( @xmath14 ) the total normalization will be slightly reduced ( for @xmath15 ) during the transfer of population through the excited level .",
    "this property of the total population is assumed throughout the paper .",

    "we see that the population of the excited state is reproduced by the approximated system with a significant error . again , as in the previous section , we explain this fact by small magnitude of quantity @xmath232 . in figure",

    "up to now we have been setting @xmath33 for all considered systems . in this section",
    "we shall explore a behaviour of the system in the presence of the non - zero one - photon detuning @xmath290 . in that case , when solving the quadratic equations for the eigenvalues of the jacobians , one gets the complex - valued discriminants , @xmath291 , where @xmath292 is their real amplitude , and @xmath293 is their phase .",
    "the eigenvalues of the jacobian then read : @xmath294 + \\nonumber \\\\",
    "+ \\rmi\\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\delta \\mp \\frac{1}{2}|d|^{1/2}\\cos{\\left(\\frac{\\varphi}{2}\\right)}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the real and imaginary parts of the discriminant are given by @xmath295 these equations are valid for the non - linear tripod ; for the other systems we get the similar expressions . if @xmath33 ( as assumed previously ) , the imaginary part becomes zero , i.e. @xmath296 ; the phase may be either @xmath297 or @xmath298 ; in the interval @xmath78 , it is @xmath299 , and in the ranges @xmath76 , @xmath77 it is @xmath300 . for @xmath299 we have @xmath123 , and for @xmath300 we get @xmath301 , @xmath302 .",
    "we have got these results for all the considered systems ( see e.g. figure [ fig_tr_non_eigvs](b ) ) . however , in the case of the non - zero one - photon detunings , in the interval @xmath78 , these real parts are no longer coinciding ; they are symmetrically surrounding the value @xmath79 , and the difference between them becomes equal to @xmath303^{1/2}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the latter approximation is valid for the small values of @xmath304 .",
    "such a situation takes place in the middle of the passage , when the rabi frequencies are large compared to the one - photon detuning and losses .",
    "we thus conclude that for such small detunings the difference between the negative real parts remains small , and our statements about the reduction of dimension remain valid .",
    "we have analysed the adiabatic reduction of the dimension of the linear and non - linear three- and four - level systems . by evaluating the corresponding jacobians and computing the dynamics of real parts of their eigenvalues ( the non - zero eigenvalues are found from quadratic characteristic equations ) ,",
    "one may define the dimensionality of the processes .",
    "this dimensionality is given by the number of zero real parts since the negative real parts cause the contraction of the nearby solutions towards the dark state .",
    "at the beginning and the end of the dynamics , there is always only one negative real part .",
    "hence one may eliminate only one state representing the excited state . in the middle of the process ,",
    "one of the zero real parts becomes negative thus making the number of negative real parts equal to two . in this time interval",
    "we may eliminate two variables corresponding to the excited and bright states respectively . for linear systems , we have eliminated both excited and bright states .",
    "however , for non - linear systems , we have restricted ourselves by eliminating the excited state .",
    "this is due to the fact that the definition of a bright state for the non - linear systems is not available .",
    "we suppose that the remaining stable degrees of freedom in the non - linear systems can be eliminated by using the asymptotic methods of non - linear dynamics .",
    "the main finding of this work is revealing that the whole stirap evolution for all considered systems is divided into three time intervals with different number of the negative real parts of the jacobians .",
    "the evolution of the real parts is equivalent for the corresponding linear and non - linear systems ( as one can see in figures [ fig_l_aties],[fig_tr_aties],[fig_l_anet ] , and [ fig_tr_non_eigvs](b ) ) .",
    "this suggests that the non - linear systems may be potentially reduced as the linear ones .",
    "physically this means that the considered three / four - level schemes may be regarded as schemes with lower dimension , i.e. with fewer levels involved . in the time intervals @xmath76 and @xmath77 ,",
    "the initially three - level system is effectively a two - level one , and in the range of @xmath78 it contains a single level .",
    "analogously , the initially four - level scheme may be regarded as a three - level ( two - level ) system in the time ranges , where @xmath76 , @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "a sensitive problem is the definition of a dark state for the non - linear tripod . in the case of non - linear lambda system ,",
    "the dark state is a moving point ( [ l_nonl_dsol ] ) in the phase space .",
    "however , for the non - linear tripod we have a manifold ( [ trip_dsa],[trip_dsb],[trip_dsc ] ) of dark states . if one wishes to get the dynamics of real parts of eigenvalues of the jacobian , one needs a definite value of complex amplitude @xmath212 belonging to the manifold .",
    "we here use two ways for the stability analysis of the dark state .",
    "the first way is to parametrize the dark state manifold by using the method developed in @xcite .",
    "this method enables one to find the definite dynamics of @xmath240 .",
    "we thus managed to find the exact dynamics of eigenvalues .",
    "the second way is to simply substitute using ( [ trip_nonl_subs ] ) the value @xmath240 by the current solution @xmath268 that is found from underlying equations ( [ trip_dina],[trip_dine],[trip_ding1],[trip_ding2 ] ) .",
    "actually , the substitution ( [ trip_nonl_subs ] ) means we are investigating the stability of the current solution instead of that for the dark state .",
    "in fact , figure [ fig_tr_non_eigvs](b ) shows that the real parts of the eigenvalues evolve almost identically .",
    "the only difference is that the splitting of real parts for approximate eigenvalues is slightly delayed .",
    "such a coincidence shows that the current solution evolves in the close neighbourhood to the motion of the parametrized dark state ( [ a0],[g1],[g2 ] ) .",
    "it is also to be noted that the magnitude of @xmath305 is always small , and the excited state remains almost unpopulated as we can see in figure [ fig_tr_non_eigvs](a ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that a related approach was used in @xcite , where a feedback control scheme was presented that designs time - dependent laser - detuning frequency to suppress possible dynamical instability in coupled free - quasibound - bound atom - molecule condensate systems .",
    "it was proposed to perform a substitution analogous to ( [ trip_nonl_subs ] ) which was used for solving the control problem . on the other hand in our work",
    "this substitution was made for the stability analysis of the dark state .",
    "it is also important to note that in the lambda and tripod systems , we have phenomenologically included the loss coefficient @xmath8 .",
    "this was done by making the one - photon detuning to be a complex number , i.e. by replacing @xmath306 . here",
    "@xmath7 is again a one - photon detuning , and @xmath8 determines the losses . in our work , we have considered the cases where @xmath33 and @xmath307 , i.e. the one - photon resonances with losses .",
    "we stress that the presence of non - zero losses @xmath8 makes the adiabatic reduction easier to implement .",
    "the losses cause the appearance of two negative real parts of eigenvalues of the corresponding jacobians . on the other hand",
    ", it was shown that the losses decrease the transfer efficiency @xcite , which decreases exponentially with the ( small ) decay rate .",
    "however the range of decay rates , over which the transfer efficiency remains high , appears to be proportional to the squared pulse area .",
    "hence , by choosing high pulse areas one may preserve the high transfer efficiency .",
    "another question is a possible presence of the one - photon detuning in the considered processes . as it was shown in section [ sec:6 ] , the relatively small one - photon detuning does not alter our conclusions about the reduction of dimension in the three- and four - level systems considered here .",
    "this happens if the rabi frequencies are large compared to the one - photon detuning and loss rates .",
