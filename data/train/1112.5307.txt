    "as discussed in the main body of of the letter , we have used a fidelity - based entanglement witness to characterize the genuine tripartite entanglement content of the state achieved upon projecting one of the qubits onto a state of the logical computational basis . without affecting the generality of our discussion , here",
    "we concentrate on the case of a qubit - projection on qubit @xmath61 giving outcome @xmath141 , thus leaving us with state @xmath142 .",
    "the fidelity - based witness that we have implemented is given in the main letter and is decomposed in five measurement settings as  @xcite @xmath143{+}5\\hat\\pi[\\hat\\sigma_a\\hat\\sigma_b\\openone_c]\\\\ & -\\sum_{l = x , y}\\sum_{k=\\pm}(\\openone_a{+}\\hat\\sigma^z_a{+}k\\hat\\sigma^l_a)(\\openone_b{+}\\hat\\sigma^z_b{+}k\\hat\\sigma^l_b)(\\openone_c{+}\\hat\\sigma^z_c{+}k\\hat\\sigma^l_c)\\big\\ } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath144 $ ] performs the permutation of the indices of its argument .",
    "the decomposition is optimal in the sense that @xmath145 can not be decomposed with lesser measurement settings .",
    "experimentally , we have used the following rearrangement of the previous expression @xmath146{+}\\hat\\pi[\\hat\\sigma^z_a\\hat\\sigma^z_b\\openone_c]\\\\ & { -}2\\hat\\pi[\\hat\\sigma^x_a\\hat\\sigma^x_b\\openone_c]{-}2\\hat\\pi[\\hat\\sigma^y_a\\hat\\sigma^y_b\\openone_c]{-}2\\hat\\pi[\\hat\\sigma^x_a\\hat\\sigma^x_b\\hat\\sigma^z_c]{-}2\\hat\\pi[\\hat\\sigma^y_a\\hat\\sigma^y_b\\hat\\sigma^z_c]\\big\\ } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which was easier to implement with our setup .",
    "a few remarks are in order on the way the client s qubit @xmath14 is experimentally measured in the actual implementation of the quantum telecloning protocol .    due to slight unbalance at bs2 of fig",
    ". 1 * c ) * of the main letter , the blue and yellow paths in the sagnac loop used in order to encode qubit @xmath14 are unbalanced .",
    "we have thus corrected for such an asymmetry by first measuring the state of qubit @xmath14 generated entering the loop only with @xmath104 modes [ _ i.e. _ the blue path in fig .",
    "2 * c ) * and * d ) * ] .",
    "we have then done the same with the @xmath105 modes ( yellow paths ) .",
    "finally , we have traced out the path degree of freedom embodied by @xmath147 by summing up the corresponding counts measured for every single projection that is needed for the implementation of single - qubit quantum state tomography , therefore reinstating symmetry .",
    "here we provide a model for the solid ( red ) line of fig .  2 * ( b ) * accounting for the fidelity of quantum telecloning of a client s mixed state .",
    "the evaluation of the theoretical fidelity of telecloning given in the main letter does not take into account the mixed nature of the client s state , as well as the non - ideality of the experimental dicke channel used for the scheme . as argued in the main letter , these are the main sources of discrepancy between the experimental results and the theoretical predictions . here we provide a simple model that includes these imperfections and allows for a more faithful comparison between theoretical predictions and experimental data .",
    "our starting point is the observation that mixed input states of the client can correspond to telecloning fidelities larger than the theoretical values predicted by @xmath148/12 $ ] .",
    "this can be straightforwardly seen by running the quantum telecloning protocol with a decohered state resulting from the application of a dephasing channel to a pure client s state of the form @xmath149 with @xmath150 as in the main letter .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "2 of the main letter .",
    "quite intuitively , as the input client s state loses tis coherences , the fidelity of telecloning improves .",
    "the second observation we make is that the entangled channel used in our experiment , although being of very good quality , has a non - unit overlap with an ideal dicke resource .",
    "taking into account the major sources of experimental imperfections , along the lines of the investigation in  @xcite , a reasonable description of the four - qubit resource produced in our experiment is the werner - like state @xmath151 with @xmath152 . the entangled dicke component in such state",
    "is evaluated considering that our experimental estimate for the lower bound on the state fidelity is@xmath153 .",
    "moreover , we have checked that slight experimental imperfections in the determination of the populations of the input client s states ( within the range observed experimentally ) do not affect the overall picture significantly .",
    "we have thus incorporated the effects of a coherence - depleted input states of qubit @xmath14 into the protocol for @xmath154 quantum telecloning performed using a mixed dicke resource as in eq .",
    "( [ wernerlike ] ) . the dephasing parameter used in the model for mixed",
    "client s state has been adjusted so that , at @xmath155 we get the real part of the experimentally reconstructed off - diagonal elements of the density matrix of qubit @xmath14 ( fixed relative phases between @xmath120 and @xmath122 do not modify our conclusions ) . the resulting state fidelity , shown in fig .",
    "2 * b ) * of the main letter , shows a very good agreement with the experimental data .",
