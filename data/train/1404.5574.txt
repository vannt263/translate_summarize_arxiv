    "ground state cooling of an engineered mechanical resonator has been recently achieved in opto- and electro - mechanical systems exploiting the so called linearized regime where the effective optomechanical interaction is enhanced by strongly driving the selected cavity mode  @xcite . in this regime",
    "the system dynamics is linear and one is typically restricted to the manipulation and detection of gaussian states of optical and mechanical modes  @xcite .",
    "if the single - photon optomechanical coupling is large enough , the nonlinear dispersive nature of the radiation - pressure interaction would allow the observation of a number of phenomena which has been recently predicted , such as photon blockade  @xcite , generation of mechanical non - gaussian steady states  @xcite , nontrivial photon statistics in the presence of coherent driving  @xcite , quantum non - demolition measurement  @xcite and quantum gates  @xcite at the single photon / phonon level .",
    "a further interesting direction is to use single photon optomechanical interferometry in this strong coupling regime for generating and detecting quantum superpositions at the macroscopic scale , eventually exploiting post - selection  @xcite .",
    "the force induced by a photon trapped in a cavity can be described by @xmath0@xcite , where an optomechanical coupling strength @xmath1 as high as @xmath2 ghz / nm has been realized @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to an instantaneous force of @xmath3 fn applied by one cavity photon . for propagating waves @xcite ,",
    "the corresponding force per photon is expressed as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the effective index of the suspended waveguide , @xmath6 is the evanescent coupling gap . in a substrate coupled device , @xmath7 could reach @xmath8 nm  @xcite .",
    "hence the force per photon could be as high as 130 fn , which is rather significant , since force down to the sub - attonewton level ( @xmath9 ) has been measured in the literature  @xcite . despite its large value , it is experimentally challenging to quantify such an instantaneous force .",
    "the interaction time of such a force is the photon cavity lifetime , which is 5 ns in a cavity with mechanical quality factor @xmath10 , and  7 fs for a propagating photon along a 10 @xmath11 m waveguide .",
    "the momentum gained by the mechanical resonator is often weak , on the order of @xmath12 kg @xmath13 . to measure such a small effect",
    ", a compromise has to be made : on one hand , a very compliant resonator is required to improve the responsibility to a weak force ; on the other hand , the thermal noise in a compliant resonator can be far more stronger than the photon effect due to the low oscillating frequency .",
    "a first theoretical study of the dynamics of an optomechanical cavity in the presence of driving at the single photon level has been carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose an experimental scheme where a very compliant resonating cantilever is coupled to a high q optical cavity able to achieve sensitive readout of an optomechanical force at the single photon level .",
    "the contribution of photon kicks , quantum fluctuations and thermal brownian excitations are calculated based on a wigner function approach .",
    "we found that by performing repeated measurements , the effect of single photons on the cantilever motion can be discriminated from the effect of thermal noise .",
    "the desired device parameters along with the requirements on cryogenic cooling are discussed .",
    "the general experimental setup we are considering is formed by an optical cavity which is coupled to a mechanical oscillator , initially at thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath14 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "we consider an experiment in which a first single - photon pulse is sent into the cavity in order to excite the resonator coupled to it . after a variable delay , a second optical pulse driving a different cavity mode is sent into the cavity in order to probe the induced mechanical motion .",
    "the proposed experiment is practically an interferometric scheme in which coherence between the two optical pulses is provided by the coherent motion of the oscillator within the two pulses .",
    "we will see that if the optomechanical coupling and the mechanical quality factor @xmath15 are large enough , the coherent mechanical dynamics can be detected as a modulation of the intensity of the second pulse as a function of the time delay between the two pulses .",
    "the oscillating signal is a direct signature of the kick of the single photon pulse and can be viewed as a sort of interference fringes associated with it .",
    "let us describe in detail the three stages of the experiment .",
    "the effective hamiltonian of the system is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the annihilation operator of the cavity mode driven by the laser pulse , @xmath18 denotes its frequency , and @xmath19 its bandwidth , while the nanomechanical resonator has frequency @xmath20 and annihilation operator @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 is the optomechanical coupling between the driven cavity mode and the resonator , which can be written as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the force per photon exerted by the cavity field , and @xmath25 is the mass of the nanomechanical resonator  @xcite .",
    "the last term in the hamiltonian describes the driving of the cavity mode by the first laser pulse , with central frequency @xmath26 and with a driving strength described by the rate @xmath27 , which is related to the input power @xmath28 by @xmath29 .    a basic assumption for the proposed experiment is considering the bad cavity limit of unresolved sidebands , i.e. , @xmath30 : this allows to choose a duration @xmath31 of the first pulse such that @xmath32 and @xmath33 , which means that during the first pulse the cavity mode reaches its steady state , while the mechanical resonator does not appreciably move .",
    "we also assume that the mechanical quality factor @xmath34 is sufficiently large ( @xmath35 ) , so that also mechanical damping effects are negligible during the first pulse .",
    "therefore the dynamics of the system during the pulse is driven by the hamiltonian of eq .",

    "the cavity remains empty because mode @xmath17 is back in its vacuum state and no other mode is excited .",
