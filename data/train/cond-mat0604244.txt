    "colloidal dispersions in liquid crystals have a wide range of applications @xcite and have recently attracted a great deal of interest @xcite .    experimental techniques such as atomic force microscopy or confocal microscopy may be used to study lc - colloid dispersions ; simulations and theory have also been applied .",

    "these approaches however have their limitations : simulation is computationally expensive , while the aforementioned phenomenological theories require , often poorly known , parameters , and are incapable of accounting for spatial variation in the density ( and , in the case of elastic theory , variation in the order parameter ) .",
    "one popular theoretical method that may be applied to this type of problem is density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite . unlike landau - de gennes or elastic theory ,",
