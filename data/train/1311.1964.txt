    "the behaviour of liquids at interfaces and in confinement is a fascinating and important area of study .",
    "for example , the behaviour of a liquid under confinement between two surfaces determines how good a lubricant that liquid is .",
    "the nature of the interactions between the liquid and the surfaces is crucial .",
    "consider , for example , the teflon coating on non - stick cooking pans , used because water does not adhere to ( wet ) the surface .",
    "one can approach the problem from a mesoscopic fluid - mechanical point of view , see for example the excellent book by de gennes , brochard - wyart and quer.@xcite however , if a microscopic approach is required , which relates the fluid properties at an interface to the nature of the molecular interactions , then one must start from statistical mechanics .",
    "there are a number of books such as refs .   which provide a good starting point .",
    "all of these include a discussion on classical density functional theory ( dft ) which is a theory for determining the density profile of a fluid in the presence of an external potential , such as that exerted by the walls of a container .",
    "dft is a statistical mechanical theory , where the aim is to calculate average properties of the system being studied . in statistical mechanics ,",
    "the central quantity of interest is the partition function @xmath0 and once this is calculated , all thermodynamic quantities are given .",
    "however , @xmath0 a sum over all the possible configurations of the system , can rarely be evaluated exactly . instead of focussing on @xmath0 , in dft we seek to develop good approximations for the free energy .",
    "it can be shown that the free energy is a functional of the fluid density profile @xmath1 and the equilibrium profile is that which minimises the free energy . over the years , a great many different approximations for the free energy functionals have been developed , generally by making contact with results from other branches of liquid - state physics .",
    "there are now quite a few lecture notes and review articles on the subject.@xcite this rather large literature can make learning about dft rather daunting .",
    "one of us ( aja ) has found in teaching this subject that a good place for students to start learning about the properties of inhomogeneous fluids , is by considering a simple lattice gas ( ising ) model .",
    "this allows students to avoid much of the liquid - state physics and functional calculus that can be daunting for undergraduates",
    "when embarking on studying dft and its applications.@xcite the advantage of starting from a lattice - gas model is that one can quickly develop a simple mean - field dft ( described below ) and then proceed to calculate the bulk fluid phase diagram and study the interfacial properties of the model , determining the wetting behaviour , finding wetting transitions and all the other interesting phenomenology of liquids at interfaces .",
    "the computer algorithms required to solve these equations are fairly simple .",
    "thus , the threshold for entering the subject and getting to the point where a student can calculate things for themselves is much lower via this route , than most other routes that we can think of .",
    "the aim of this paper is two - fold : ( i ) to derive the mean - field dft for an inhomogeneous lattice - gas fluid , whilst explaining the physics of the theory .",
    "this presentation assumes the reader has had introductory statistical mechanics and thermodynamics courses , but little else beyond that .",
    "( ii ) to illustrate the types of quantities that dft can be used to calculate , such as the surface tension of the liquid - gas interface , to study wetting behaviour or to answer the question `` what is the shape of a drop of liquid on a surface ? ''",
    "we also give some exercises for students .",
    "this paper is laid out as follows : in  [ sec : continuum ] we introduce the statistical mechanics of simple liquids . we set up the dft model in  [ sec : discrete ] and [ sec : potentials ] .",
    "the bulk fluid phase diagram is discussed in  [ sec : phase ] .",
    "we describe the iterative method for solving the model in  [ sec : solving ] before displaying some typical results in  [ sec : results ] . finally , some conclusions are drawn in  [",
    "sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we consider a fluid composed of @xmath2 atoms / molecules in a container .",
    "what follows is also relevant to colloidal suspensions and so we simply refer to the atoms , molecules , colloids , etc as ` particles ' .",
    "the energy is a function of the set of position and momentum coordinates , @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively , and is given by the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the kinetic energy @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the potential energy due to the interactions between the particles and also to any external potentials such as those due to the container walls . when treating the system in the canonical ensemble , which has fixed volume @xmath9 , particle number @xmath2 and temperature @xmath10 , the probability that the system is in a particular state is@xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the canonical partition function , @xmath13 is plank s constant and @xmath14 where @xmath15 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "the partition function allows macroscopic thermodynamic quantities to be related to the microscopic properties of the system which are defined in @xmath16 ( see below ) .",
    "the kinetic energy contribution , is solely a function of the momenta @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , the precise form of which is yet to be defined , only depends on the positions of the particles @xmath19 .",
    "this allows the partition function to be simplified by performing the gaussian integrals over the momenta to obtain @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the thermal de broglie wavelength and @xmath22 is the configuration integral.@xcite thus , the partition function is just the configuration integral multiplied by a factor that depends on @xmath2 , @xmath10 and @xmath23 and so the value of @xmath24 is irrelevant for determining the state of the system .",
    "changing @xmath21 just adds a constant to the free energy per particle [ see eq .  ]",
    "and so we safely assume @xmath25",
    ".    evaluating @xmath26 is the central problem here and , in general , this can not be done and so approximations are required . in the following section we develop a simple lattice model approximation that allows progress .",

    "we discuss below how the system can instead be considered in the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "0.2        0.2        we assume that the fluid is two dimensional ( 2d ) , to simplify the analysis . however , everything can easily be extended to a three dimensional ( 3d ) system .",
    "we imagine a lattice discretises the space occupied by the fluid and so any configuration of particles may be described by a set of lattice occupation numbers @xmath27 which define if the lattice sites are filled ( @xmath28 ) or empty ( @xmath29 ) with @xmath30 being the occupation number of site @xmath31 .",

    "note the short hand @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are integer indices defining the 2d lattice .      to proceed , we must define the potential energy contribution to the hamiltonian , @xmath8 .",
    "we assume the following form @xmath38 the first term is the contribution from the external potential @xmath39 and the second term is the energy contribution from pair interactions between particles .",
    "we assume that there are no three - body or higher interactions .",
    "the interaction energy between particles at two lattice sites @xmath31 and @xmath40 is @xmath41 .",

    "the term @xmath44 denotes a sum over all pairs of lattice sites in the system .",
    "considering only pair interactions greatly simplifies the task of evaluating the partition function , but it can still be very arduous to evaluate this sum even for a moderately sized system .",
    "the probability of being in a particular configuration , @xmath45 , for a fixed number of particles @xmath2 , is now @xmath46 with the partition function defined as @xmath47 where ` state ' is a shorthand for a particular allowed set of occupation numbers @xmath45 .",

    "the reservoir has a fixed chemical potential @xmath64 , and as the system is connected to this reservoir it has the same chemical potential ( recall that the chemical potential is the energy required to insert a particle into the system ) .",
    "physically , the easiest way to conceive the grand canonical ensemble is to imagine the system as being a subsystem of a much larger structure , with which it can exchange particles , and where the reservoir fixes @xmath10 and @xmath65 in the subsystem .",
