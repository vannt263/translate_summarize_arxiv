    "the sensitivities of second - generation ( advanced ligo , advanced virgo , geo - hf , and lcgt ) and third - generation ( einstein telescope ) interferometric gravitational wave detectors will be partly limited by thermal fluctuations in the mirrors @xcite .",
    "the pioneering articles on this issue were dedicated to the investigation of the mirror _ substrate _ fluctuation : brownian thermal noise @xcite and thermo - elastic noise  @xcite .",
    "fundamental thermal motion ( brownian motion ) of material atoms or molecules causes brownian noise .",
    "fundamental thermodynamic fluctuations of temperature lead to thermo - elastic noise through the material s thermal expansion .",
    "similarly thermo - refractive noise @xcite is caused by temperature fluctuations leading to fluctuations of the refractive index and therefore fluctuations of the optical path length inside the material .",
    "these results were obtained for the model of an infinite test mass , i.e. the mirror was considered to be an elastic layer with infinite width and finite thickness .",
    "all of these results were generalized for a finite - size mirror model @xcite .",
    "very soon the importance of mirror _ coating _ thermal noise was realized as its parameters may differ considerably from the mirror substrate parameters . despite its low thickness , the very high loss angle of the mirror coating materials ( usually sio@xmath0  and ta@xmath0o@xmath1 ) makes the coating brownian noise the most significant one among all kinds of mirror thermal noise @xcite .",
    "the thermo - elastic noise of the coatings only has a small contribution in the total noise budget @xcite .",
    "later , kimble @xcite proposed the idea of thermal noise compensation which was explored carefully in @xcite for a particular case of thermo - elastic and thermo - refractive noise .    the coating brownian noise is still one of the main contributions to the noise spectra of gravitational wave observatories @xcite .",
    "one of the most promising approaches aimed to decrease its level was offered by khalili @xcite who proposed to replace the end mirror in the interferometer arm with a short fabry - prot cavity tuned to anti - resonance ( see center panel of figure [ fig : schematics ] ) . in practice",
    "most light is reflected from only a few first layers ( farest from substrate ) and all others ( located closer to substrate ) only reflect a small part of light .",
    "however , since the thermal fluctuations are proportional to the total thickness of the coating and the inner layers of coating are the main contribution to the phase fluctuations of the reflected light , the transmittance of each mirror can be higher to realize the same reflectivity of the system as a compound end mirror .",
    "the total thickness of coatings in such _ khalili cavity _",
    "mirrors is the same as the thickness of the conventional mirror , while the brownian noise of the end mirror of a khalili cavity is significantly reduced @xcite because the thickness fluctuations of the second end mirror coating ( eem in figure [ fig : schematics ] ) do not influence the fluctuations of the input mirror coating ( iem in figure [ fig : schematics ] ) .",
    "moreover , using a rigidly controlled khalili cavity allows a reduction of coating brownian noise @xcite .",
    "one of the main problems in the khalili cavity is to establish a low - noise control of the mirror positions ( see detailed explanation in sec .",
    "[ thermlens ] ) .",
    "a potentially easier way is to use a _ khalili etalon _ ( ke ) instead of a khalili cavity ( kc ) or a simple conventional mirror ( cm ) .",
    "the idea is to use a single mirror but to split the coating into two parts ( see right hand panel of figure ( eem in figure [ fig : schematics ] ) : _ the front coating _ ( on the front substrate surface ) features just a few layers and _ the rear coating _ ( on the rear substrate surface ) consists of the rest of the required coating layers .",
    "the purpose of this article is to develop an idea of the khalili etalon @xcite , to calculate the total mirror thermal noise arising in a ke and in a cm , and to compare them .",
    "we investigate the idea of using a ke in the einstein telescope ( et ) and advanced ligo ( aligo ) . in sec .",
    "[ optim ] we describe the mirror parameter optimization procedure , namely the optimal number of layer pairs in the front coating . in sec .",
    "[ tninke ] we describe the details of the thermal noises arising in the ke and cm calculations .",
    "section  [ thermlens ] is dedicated to the problem of thermal lensing which is much more important in a ke than in a cm . in sec .",
    "[ conc ] we discuss the obtained results and draw the conclusions . finally , some calculation details are provided in the appendices [ appa]-[appb ] .",
    "the main idea of using a ke is to reduce the mirror s total thermal noise without reducing its reflectivity . by _",
    "total thermal noise spectral density _",
    "we mean the sum of the brownian , thermo - elastic and thermo - refractive noise spectral densities . coating brownian noise is caused mostly by the fluctuations of the entire coating thickness .",
    "it would then seem evident that brownian noise be lower when the front coating contains less layers and hence the lowest noise be achieved for the coating totally displaced to the rear mirror surface .",
    "this is in principle true but at the same time some other noises , such as substrate thermo - refractive noise , rise dramatically causing the total noise level to rise also .",
    "moreover , the less layers one puts onto the front coating , the higher will be the absorption in the substrate .",
    "so there has to be an optimum of how to best distribute the coating layers between the front and back surfaces in order to obtain minimal total thermal noise and not too much of absorption in substrate .",
    "the aim of this section is to find this optimum configuration .",
    "the only way to find the optimal number of front coating layers , @xmath2 , is to compare the thermal noise for every @xmath2 .",
    "this requires the calculation of the different noise contributions as functions of the front coating layers number @xmath2 .",
    "the most basic principles we used are : ( i ) the total number of ta@xmath0o@xmath1  and sio@xmath0  layers , @xmath3 , is fixed , i.e. we used the coating structure planned for both et and aligo and modified it to fit the double coating paradigm : 20 ta@xmath0o@xmath1  and 18 sio@xmath0  quarter - wave layers plus the substrate ( it is considered as an ordinary but `` slightly '' thicker coating layer ) and plus two caps consisting of a half - wavelength sio@xmath0  layer ( for the cm it would have been 20 ta@xmath0o@xmath1  layers and 19 sio@xmath0  layers plus one cap ) ; ( ii ) a quarter - wavelength ta@xmath0o@xmath1  layer and a quarter - wavelength sio@xmath0  layer are alternately coated on the front or rear surface so that there are always an odd number of front coating layers ( @xmath4 1 , 3 , 5 etc . ) and also an odd number of layers of the rear coating @xmath5 ( 37 , 35 , 33 etc . ) .",
    "please note that the substrate and caps are not included in these numbers ; ( iii ) the number of layers of the front coating @xmath2 is the argument and the total thermal noise driven mirror displacement @xmath6 is the function of it ; ( iv ) we consider only brownian , thermo - elastic and thermo - refractive noises ( being the most significant contributions ) , and ( v ) we used the mirror of a finite - size cylinder , the model of which has been developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and calculated all noises numerically using the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) @xcite as it is briefly described in secs .",
    "[ optbn]-[optabs ] .",
    "the optimal number of front coating layers appeared to be @xmath7 , i.e. @xmath8 ta@xmath0o@xmath1  layers and @xmath9 sio@xmath0  layer plus a cap in the front coating and @xmath10 ta@xmath0o@xmath1  layers and @xmath11 sio@xmath0  layers plus a cap in the rear coating . with the technical feasibility taken into account ( see sec .",
    "[ optabs ] ) , however , it turns out that the system with @xmath12 layers on the front surface ( i.e. @xmath13 ta@xmath0o@xmath1  layers and @xmath8 sio@xmath0  layers plus a cap on the front mirror surface and @xmath11 ta@xmath0o@xmath1  layers and @xmath14 sio@xmath0  layers plus a cap on the rear surface ) will be better and we analyze the system with @xmath12 in detail . in this case the mirror thermal noise does not reach its minimum but it is only about @xmath15% higher .",
    "the total coating thermal noise of the etalon will be the sum of noise on the front surface and noise on the back surface : @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the displacement of the front surface of the mirror and @xmath18 the displacement of the boundary surface between the rear surface of the mirror substrate and the coating on it .",
    "considering the ke as a fabry - prot cavity consisting of two mirrors with amplitude reflectivities @xmath19 ( front coating ) and @xmath20 ( rear coating ) tuned to anti - resonance , one can calculate the coefficients @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( see details in ref .",

    "note that @xmath19 and @xmath20 are functions of the number of front and rear coating layers .",
    "in particular , we have the following formulas for @xmath19 and @xmath20 as functions of the number of the front coating layers @xmath2 ( @xmath5 is the number of the rear coating layers ) : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are ta@xmath0o@xmath1  and sio@xmath0  coating layers refractive indices .",
    "hence , in order to calculate spectral density @xmath28 of the displacement @xmath29 caused by thermal noise using the fdt , one has to apply the forces @xmath30 to the front and rear coatings correspondingly and to calculate the total dissipated power @xcite . for the calculation of the spectral density @xmath31 of brownian coating noise the dissipated power may be calculated through the elastic energy @xmath32 stored in each @xmath33-th layer ( of the front or rear coating ) : @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the strain and stress tensor components ( only the non - zero components are shown in the formula above ) , @xmath37 is the mirror radius and @xmath38 is the thickness of the @xmath33-th layer .",
    "the components @xmath35 and @xmath36 are calculated as it is described in detail in  @xcite .",
    "then the brownian noise spectral density may be evaluated as follows : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath41 is the absolute temperature and @xmath42 is the loss angle describing structural losses in the @xmath33-th layer .",
    "the sum is taken over all layers , i.e. @xmath43 is the number of layers without the substrate and the caps .",
    "the total number of summands is therefore @xmath44 ; @xmath43 layers in the front and rear coatings , plus @xmath8 layer - caps and @xmath9 layer - substrate .",
    "so the index @xmath45 refers to the front coating cap , the indices @xmath46 refer to the front coating quarter wavelength ( qwl ) layers , the index @xmath47 refers to the substrate , the indices @xmath48 refer to the rear coating qwl layers and the index @xmath49 refers to the rear coating cap .",

    "the dissipated power one should calculate the diagonal components @xmath56 of the strain tensor for each layer ( including the substrate and the caps ) and take the trace : @xmath57 then one may find the power dissipated through the te mechanism @xcite : @xmath58 ^ 2r\\,dr\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath59 is the thermal conductivity , @xmath60 is the thermal capacity per unit volume , @xmath61 is the young s modulus , @xmath62 is the poisson s ration , @xmath63 is the thermal expansion coefficient , @xmath64 is the density , and the index @xmath33 denotes number of the layer . therefore , the te noise spectral density will simply be : @xmath65    similar to the brownian noise calculations , the summands with the indices @xmath66 are relevant for the coating te noise while the one with the index @xmath47 needs to be considered for the te noise of the substrate :    @xmath67      tr noise originates from thermodynamic fluctuations of the temperature @xmath68 in the substrate , producing phase fluctuations of the reflected wave phase via the temperature dependence of the substrate s refraction index @xmath24 .",
    "likewise , the phase fluctuations may be recalculated into effective fluctuations of mirror surface displacement @xmath69 where the coefficient @xmath22 introduced in ( [ e1e2 ] ) , characterizes the light amplitude circulating inside the substrate and @xmath70 is the thermo - optic coefficient of the substrate .",
    "we calculate the thermo - refractive ( tr ) noise in the substrate using the model of an infinitely large plane in the transverse directions with thickness of @xmath71 .",

    "( 2 ) of ref .  @xcite in a simpler form with only the normal incidence and the circular beam being considered : @xmath78    in addition we have to consider the tr noise present in the coatings @xcite .",

    "the dashed lines indicate the strain levels for the standard aligo design , while the solid lines show the potentially reduced noise levels originating from the application of ke as end test masses , as described in this article .",
    "the main difference between these two scenarios originates from the reduction of coating brownian noise by a factor 2.18 , as described by the values in the right hand column of table [ noisesetal ] .",
    "please note that thermal noise contributions from the input mirrors stay identical for the two scenarios .",
    "the corresponding increase in the binary inspiral range ( 1.4 solar masses , snr of 8 , averaged sky location ) is about 15% and therefore yields an relative increase of the binary neutron star inspiral event rate of about 50% .",
    "figure [ et_comparison ] shows the sensitivity improvement of a potential et high frequency detector as described in @xcite for the replacement of the conventional end mirrors by kes . following the values given in table [ noisesetal ] we considered a flat coating brownian noise reduction factor of 1.76 for the end test masses , while again we assumed the thermal noise of the input test masses to stay constant .",
    "this yields an overall reduction of the total thermal noise of all test masses of about 25% and an increase in the observatory sensitivity of up to 20% in the most sensitive frequency band between 50 and 400hz .",
    "we find an increase in the binary neutron star inspiral range of 15% from 1593 to 1833mpc .",
    "this corresponds to an increase in the binary neutron star inspiral event rate of about 50% .",
    "figure [ fig : schematics ] shows the simplified schematics of an aligo or et interferometer with different end mirror configurations . replacing the conventional end mirrors by kcs would have a significant impact on the required hardware . instead of a single end mirror suspended from a single seismic isolation system per end mirror , in the case of the kc two mirrors with two full seismic isolation systems are required at the end of each arm cavity .",
    "this means that with kcs there are six ( 2x i m , 2x iem , 2x eem ) instead of four optical elements ( 2x i m , 2 em ) , which require the maximal seismic isolation .",
    "the concept of the ke allows us to still significantly reduce the thermal noise contribution of the end mirrors , while being compatible with the already available seismic isolation systems .",
    "therefore , it is in principle possible to upgrade a 2nd or 3rd generation gravitational wave detector by replacing conventional end mirrors by kes without altering or extending the vacuum systems and seimsic isolation systems .",
    "in addition to the reduced hardware requirements , the main advantage of the kes with respect to kcs is the potential simplification of several aspects related to the interferometric sensing and control .",
    "upgrading aligo or an et interferometer from its standard configuration to employ kcs increases the length degrees of freedom of the main interferometer from five ( darm ( differential arm length ) , mich ( michelson cavity length ) , srcl ( signal recycling cavity length ) , carm ( common arm length ) , prcl ( power recycling cavity arm length ) ) to a total of seven .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the additional two degrees of freedom actually have a very strong coupling to the differential arm length channel of the interferometer .",
    "for the example of the coating distribution discussed in this article , the length of the kc needs to be stabilized with an accuracy of only a factor 10 less than what is required for the main arm cavities .",
    "that means the length of the kc needs to be orders of magnitude more stable than for example the differential arm length of the central michelson interferometer .        in order to achieve this demanding stability of the kc one",
    "has to make use of highly dedicated readout and control schemes .",
    "special care needs to be taken to avoid introducing potential control noise at the low frequency end , which could potentially spoil the overall sensitivity of the gravitational wave detector .    substituting the kc , consisting of two individual mirrors potentially encountering independent driven motion ( for example seismic ) , by the proposed ke would ensure that both relevant mirror surfaces would be rigidly coupled via the etalon substrate .",
    "therefore , the length of the ke would be much less susceptible to seismic disturbances or gravity gradient noise , as compared to the length of kc .",
    "also in terms of potential control noise the ke is advantageous over the kc . in case of the kc",
    "the mirror positions would have to be controlled by means of coil magnet actuators or electro - static actuators , which can potentially introduce feedback noise at frequencies within the detection band of the gravitational wave detector .",
    "in contrast the length of the ke can be locked by controlling the etalon s substrate temperature ( using the temperature dependency of the index of refraction ) .",
    "since the etalon substrate acts as a thermal low pass , the etalon length will be extremely constant for all frequencies within the detection band of the interferometer .    however ,",
    "not only the length sensing and control is highly demanding in case of a kc , but also the alignment sensing and control . again the key point here is to find a high signal to noise error - signal and then applying low noise feedback systems to keep the mirrors of the kc aligned in pitch and yaw . as the kc would be rather short compared to the main arm cavities , the kcs would unfortunately feature a high mode degeneracy , i.e. it would not only be resonant for the desired tem@xmath191 mode , but also for higher order modes , which would further increase the alignment requirements . using a ke would potentially allow us to transfer the alignment control problem from the detector operation to the manufacturing process of the etalon . if it would be possible to manufacture an ke with sufficiently parallel front and back surface , we would not need to actively control the relative alignment of the ke surfaces during operation .",
    "the two parameters that would be most relevant are the relative curvature mismatch of the etalon front and rear surfaces as well as the parallelism of the two surfaces .",
    "as we have shown in @xcite the curvature mismatch is the dominating factor for the etalon s performance .          in this section",
    "we will compare the thermal lensing @xcite of the kc configuration to the one of a ke . in the case of the kc",
    "we have the following absorption processes : ( i ) iem front coating , ( ii ) iem substrate , ( iii ) iem anti - reflex coating on its rear surface and ( iv ) front coating of eem . in the case of the proposed ke",
    "the situation is pretty similar apart from process ( iii ) , which does not exist .    in the following we will show by means of fem that the actual thermal lensing induced into the ke is of the same order , but slightly smaller than in the case of the kc .    the fem used here treats the mirror as a substrate . the coatings and the laser beam are included as heat sources . for the reflective coatings we assume an absorption of 0.5 ppm , and 1 ppm for the anti - reflective coating in the kc .",
    "the fem assumes an emissivity @xmath192 , an ambient temperature of 300  k and uses the parameters from table [ paramgeom ] and [ paramphys ] for the values of aligo . after computing the temperature and displacements of the finite elements , the optical path difference ( opd ) is derived . for the opd we included the temperature dependence of the refractive index ( which is the dominant thermal lensing effect in fused silica ) and the expansion , while we omitted the elasto - optic effect .",
    "we also did not include surface to surface radiation in the kc .",
    "this would make the thermal lens worse , and is therefore safe to exclude in order to make a conservative comparison between kc and ke .",
    "[ fig : fem ] shows the temperature distribution in a kc and a ke for the aligo parameters with n@xmath193=5 , while fig .",
    "[ fig : therm_lens ] presents the corresponding opd for a single pass due to the thermo - optic effect and expansion of the substrate , as well as a fit of an opd that would be caused by an ideal thin lens .",
    "the fits are least square fits , weighted by the beam intensity . for the aligo parameters with n@xmath193=5 , the thermal lensing in the kc can be described by a thermal lens with a focal length of @xmath194 m , while the opd in the ke can be fitted by a thermal lens with a focal length of @xmath195 m. the respective values for et are a focal length of 1797 m for the kc and 1838 m for kes .",
    "it follows that the induced thermal lensing in the kc and ke is of similar strength .",
    "as we have shown above , the thermal lensing for the ke is slightly weaker than for the kc .",
    "as one can see from the magnitude of the induced thermal lensing , the compensation of this effect will be extremely challenging in both cases .",
    "potential ways of mitigating the thermal lensing could include innovative approaches such as radiative cooling @xcite or pre - shaped mirror or etalon substrates , which feature the wrong curvature , when being cold , but develop the correct shape when operated at the designed optical power .",
    "the compensation of thermal lensing has turned out to be more challenging than anticipated in the first generation gravitational wave detectors .",
    "only , the practical experience that will be collected with the advanced detectors will allow us to realistically judge the feasibility of kcs as well as kes .",
    "however , the main purpose of the thermal lensing analysis presented here was to show that the thermal lens will not be worse , but slightly better for the proposed ke compared to a kc .",
    "in this article we have investigated the main thermal noise sources arising in the mirrors of the two next generation gravitational wave detectors : advanced ligo and einstein telescope .",
    "the thermal noise sources include brownian , thermo - elastic and thermo - refractive noise of the mirror coatings and the mirror substrate , among which the brownian coating noise is the largest .",
    "we applied our model developed in  @xcite to study the idea of the khalili etalon to decrease the coating thermal noise and to improve the sensitivity .",
    "the optimum ke configuration minimizing the total thermal noise level was found to be with @xmath8  ta@xmath0o@xmath1  layers and @xmath9  sio@xmath0  layer plus a cap in the front coating and with @xmath10  ta@xmath0o@xmath1  layers and @xmath11  sio@xmath0  layers plus a cap in the rear coating .",
    "however , since the substrate absorption in et with such a configuration is @xmath196  w , and that in aligo is @xmath197  w , our choice is not to use the optimal but a slightly different coating distribution with @xmath12 , i.e. @xmath13  ta@xmath0o@xmath1  and @xmath8  sio@xmath0  layers plus a cap on the front surface and @xmath11  ta@xmath0o@xmath1  and @xmath14  sio@xmath0  layers plus a cap on the rear surface .",
    "the absorbed power in the substrate with such a configuration is @xmath198  w for et and @xmath199  w for aligo .",
    "such an absorption is around 1  ppm which seems to be reasonable price for the thermal noise enhancement .",
    "the total noise spectral density of et and aligo can be improved by the factors of @xmath200 and @xmath201 , respectively , compared with the cases of conventional end mirrors .",
    "moreover , we have checked our numerical calculations with a very simple qualitative consideration designed to make an order of magnitude estimation .",
    "this estimation shows an agreement of better than @xmath15 percent with the exact numerical calculations . a use of kes instead of conventional end mirrors would improve the detection rate of the binary neutron star inspirals with the future gravitational wave observatories by about 50%",
    "we also discussed the feasibility of the khalili etalon compared with that of the khalili cavity .",
    "the ke is more advantageous in terms of the hardware requirements .",
    "we also compared the thermal lensing effects in the ke and in the kc and found that the former is slightly better for not having the anti - reflective coatings that kc contains on the rear surface of the front mirror .",
    "in fact , the thermal lensing problem in either case is quite severe and we should explore a way to compensate the lensing effect without imposing excess noise .    in this paper we assumed that the light is reflected on the outer surface of each coating without taking into account reflections from inner layers . a more accurate analysis shown in ref .",
    "@xcite gives a value of coating brownian noise slightly lower ( about @xmath142% ) .",
    "thermoelastic and thermo - refractive noises originate from a thermodynamical fluctuation of the temperature and the correlation of the two noises can be non - trivial with a certain set of parameters  @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "the correlation was ignored and we treated the two noises individually , which is not a problem as one of them is much lower than the other in the case of ke ( see table  [ noisesetal ] ) . it should be noted , however , that the optimal ke configuration could be determined in such a way that thermoelastic noise and thermo - refractive noise be negatively compensated if the mechanical loss angles of the coating materials were 10 times lower than the current values .",

    "we assume that the optical path between the mirrors is fixed to a quarter wavelength , i.e. @xmath211 .",

    "the fluctuations @xmath207 and @xmath208 are small enough compared with the cavity length @xmath206 so that we may expand ( [ b2 ] ) into series over @xmath207 and @xmath208 . keeping the linear terms only , we get @xmath214,\\\\    \\epsilon_1 & = \\frac{r_2(1-n_s)+r_1\\big[1+(1+n_s)r_1r_2+r_2 ^ 2\\big]}{\\big(1+r_1r_2\\big)^2},\\label{e1}\\\\     \\epsilon_2&=\\frac{n_sr_2\\big(1-r_1 ^ 2\\big)}{\\big(1+r_1r_2\\big)^2},\\label{e2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which have been introduced in eq .  .",

    "a multilayer coating consisting of layers with refractive indices @xmath215 and lengths @xmath216 is described by the same formulas for the transmission line consisting of ports with wave resistances @xmath217 and the distances @xmath216 @xcite .",
