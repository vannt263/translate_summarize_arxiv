    "preferential growth describes systems consisting of groups of entities where the probability of the attachment of a new entity to one of the groups is an increasing function of the group s size .",
    "recently these types of models were used to describe networks like the world wide web ( www )  @xcite , internet  @xcite , statistics of scientific citation  @xcite _ etc _ which seems to have the common property of scale invariance .",
    "it turned out that this behavior is due to two main facts namely that they are continuously evolving and that the attachment probability is proportional to the group s size .",
    "many features of the above mentioned systems were analyzed and also analytic calculations have been presented for the most important quantities  @xcite but they are only valid in the asymptotic time case . here",
    "we present the full - time dependent solutions .",
    "we applied this kind of model to describe herding in an economic system .",
    "it was suggested  @xcite that large price movements on the stock market can be explained by the fact that traders are not individual participants but they prefer to form groups , within a group each trader share the same strategy .",
    "our assumption is that those groups are created according to a preferential growth model .",
    "preferential growth occurs naturally in economics  @xcite .",
    "the power - law behavior of the resulting group distribution can account for the fat - tail distribution of the return which is one of the stylized fact that characterize the stock market .    in the paper we present the full - time dependent solution of the growth model , and",
    "briefly describe the most important results of our economic model .",
    "the system consists of individual groups of entities .",
    "the initial condition is one group with one entity in it . at each time step one new entity",
    "is added to the system . with probability @xmath0",
    "it creates a new group , with @xmath5 it will belong to one of the existing groups . the probability that it joins the @xmath2th group is proportional to the @xmath2th group s size ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the system s dynamic  the time evolution of the @xmath2th group s size distribution , @xmath1  can be described by a master equation : @xmath7 the quantity @xmath8 denotes the probability that at time @xmath3 the system consists of @xmath2 group : @xmath9 . our goal is to determine the analytic full - time dependent form of the following quantities : size distribution , @xmath1 , and mean , @xmath10 , of the individual groups and the average group size distribution , @xmath11 . here",
    "we do not go into the details of the deduction we only present the results .",
    "( for more informations see@xcite ) . for the size distribution of the individual groups one gets : @xmath12.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from @xmath1 we can easily calculate the analytic form of @xmath13 and @xmath14 by simple substitution in their definitions and we get : @xmath15 \\\\ % & & \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\nonumber \\\\ % \\mki ( t ) & = & \\sum_{l=1}^{t - i+1 } ( -1)^{l-1}\\ l\\ { t - i+2 \\choose l+1 } { \\gamma(t - lp ) \\over \\gamma(t)\\gamma(1-lp ) } \\times \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\qquad \\times",
    "\\left[\\ \\sum_{b = i}^t { \\gamma(b)\\gamma(1-lp ) \\over \\gamma(b - lp)}\\ { b-2 \\choose i-2}\\ p^{b - i}\\ ( 1-p)^{i-1 } \\right ] .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the case when the system is large ( @xmath16 ) it is worth to analyze the asymptotic case of the above quantities in order to gain a much simpler form . _",
    "i ) individual group size distribution _    in eq .",
    "( [ pm_i , k , t ] ) there are two time dependent terms .",
    "one is @xmath17 , the other is the sum in the bracket . for large @xmath3 values",
    "the second term will be proportional to a hypergeometric function , @xmath18 , and will be time independent .",
    "the first term will converge to @xmath19 which is a fast decaying function of @xmath20 so for @xmath21 one can assume that only the first term of the sum in eq .",
    "( [ pm_i , k , t ] ) gives non - negligible component : @xmath22 for large @xmath2 values the above form simplifies further and we finally get : @xmath23 _ ii ) mean of individual group size _    in the analysis of the mean value we assume that for @xmath24 the distribution can be described by eq .",
    "( [ pm_i , k , inf ] ) for larger @xmath4 values it has a fast decay so : @xmath25 .",
    "( the value @xmath26 can be defined _",
    "e.g. _ as the inflection point of @xmath1 ) . here",
    "again analyzing the large @xmath2 case we get : _ iii ) distribution of average group size _    in the determination of the asymptotic case of the average group size distribution , @xmath27 , we can apply two ways .",
    "one is to simply analyze the limit of eq .",
    "( [ p_k , t ] ) or we can also start directly from the master equation , eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) , by summing it up for @xmath28 . in both cases",
    "we get that in the long time limit the distribution will be time independent and will have a power - law decay : @xmath29 here we would like to mention that however our growth model is not a network model for particular values of the parameter ( @xmath30 ) it can be considered as a mean field analogy of the barabsi s network model .",
    "the resulting exponent of the distribution , ( @xmath31 ) , agrees with their result  @xcite .",
    "the main properties of stock markets price movements are characterized by the so called stylized facts , the distribution of the logarithmic return fat - tailed , autocorrelation of the return is short range while that of the absolute value of return decays with a power - law .",
    "we try to reproduce these properties by a simple model .",
    "power - law decay of the distribution of the logarithmic return can be explained by the herding behavior on the market @xcite .",
    "price changes are assumed to be proportional to the excess demand ",
    "the difference between the amount of buying and selling orders .",
    "if traders form groups so that within each group everyone shares the same strategy than the logarithmic return can be expressed as : @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the strategy ( to buy , to sell or not to trade ) , @xmath34 is the size of the @xmath2th group .",
    "if the number of groups that are active ( trading ) at a given time step is small the distribution of the logarithmic return , @xmath35 will be similar to that of the groups size distribution , @xmath36 . in our model groups",
    "are created according to the above mentioned growth model .",
    "due to eq .",
    "( [ p_k , inf ] ) @xmath36 will have a power - law decay which indicates that for law activity the distribution of logarithmic return is also a power - law .",
    "similar results were get by @xcite but they considered trading groups as two dimensional percolation clusters .",
    "power - law correlation of the absolute value of price is due to the long range correlation of the trading volume ( number of trades in a given time interval )  @xcite , which is in our model the sum of the active groups sizes , @xmath37 .",
    "we defined the activity ( fraction of groups that are trading at a given time step , @xmath38 ) as the function of the deviation of the actual price from some fundamental price , @xmath39 ; see fig .",
    "[ activity ] .",
    "( we took the fundamental price for constant over time . )",
    "we ensure with this definition that the activities of the proceeding time steps are correlated . for a given activity value",
    "the corresponding trading volumes can be different but in average larger activity implies larger trading volume which indicates that the sum of the trading groups sizes will also be correlated .",
    "the form of the function was chosen intuitively , it is based on the hypothesis that small deviation from the fundamental price inspire traders  their activity rises  while for large deviations traders become careful so their activity falls back .",
    "the results of our model can be seen in fig .",
    "[ result ] .",
    "it is surprising that for the distribution of the logarithmic return we not only got a simple power - law but a distribution with two different exponents ( fig .",
    "[ result]/a ) which is similar to what was measured on the real market@xcite .",
    "this is , however , only a qualitative agreement , the value of the exponents differ from the measured ones  @xcite .    to analyze the autocorrelation of the absolute value of return we study the variance of the sum of these variables ( normalized to unit variance ) : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the autocorrelation function .",
    "for @xmath42 we have @xmath43 , for variables with long - range correlation ( @xmath44 ) @xmath45 , and the correlation exponent , @xmath46 , can be calculated through @xmath47 ; see fig .",
    "[ result]/b .",
    "it is clearly shown that the time series of the absolute value of the logarithmic return is correlated but the exponent is much smaller ( @xmath48 ) than the reported one ( @xmath49 )  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of our model is its simplicity and that the results have a qualitative agreement with the stylized facts .",
    "however , there are tunable parameters in it and the results  the values of the exponents of the distribution and of the autocorrelation  depend on them .",
    "further study is needed to clarify the role of these parameters .",
