    "there are two problems in theoretical mechanics , which influence on developing of many branches of mathematics and mechanics can not be underestimated :    * the problem of rotation of rigid body with one fixed point ; * the restricted three - body problem ( rtbp ) .",
    "planar circular rtbp is an example of rather simple but non - integrable hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom , which possesses all the richness of its phase flow behavior .",
    "the most interesting objects of this problem are periodic orbits and their families . on our opinion the following quote from  ( * ? ? ?",

    "the singular case is much more complicated and regular case methods do not applicable .",
    "michel hnon provided an approach based on a concept of so called `` generating solution '' .",
    "this approach together with the highest level of numerical computations allowed to reach the understanding of structure of the main families of periodic solutions of the planar circular rtbp .",
    "the first hnon s paper  @xcite devoted to periodic solutions of the rtbp was published in 1965 and the last his paper  @xcite was published in 2005 . during this period m.hnon consequently developed and used an approach based on generating solution technique for studying periodic orbits of the second species or _ orbits with consecutive collisions _ as they were called by poincar .",
    "almost at the same time another researcher ",
    "professor a.d.bruno  provided his own studying of the rtbp s periodic solutions .",
    "they independently obtained the structure of generating solutions of the rtbp and from here mutually interacted with each other during about 30 years . in presented contribution",
    "we want to show that there was such a kind of scientific competition between michel hnon and alexander bruno .",
    "as hnon mentioned in the preface to the book  @xcite his work over generating solutions of the rtbp lasted about thirty years . during this period he interrupted his study and then came back again . may be it is possible to divide the thirty years long interval of the rtbp s orbits investigation into three main blocks .      during 1965",
    "- 70 hnon presented some papers devoted to numerical exploration of periodic solutions of the rtbp .",
    "symmetric orbits for ( @xmath0 ) were investigated .",
    "let us recall the setting of the rtbp .",
    "two massive pointlike bodies @xmath1 and @xmath2 move in a plane under the influence of newton s gravitational law around their center of mass along circular orbits . in the same plane of motion",
    "there is another one massless body @xmath3 which motion one want to study .",
    "the units of distance , mass and time are selected in a such way that the distance between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , total mass of these bodies , gravitational constant are equal to unity and the period of revolution is equal to @xmath4 . in",
    "synodical i.e. uniformly rotating frame body @xmath1 is situated in the origin and the position of the body @xmath2 is point with coordinates @xmath5 .",
    "the only parameter of the problem is so called _ mass parameter _ @xmath6  the mass of the second body . the hamiltonian function of the rtbp in rotating frame is following @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 .    from the practical point of view the most interesting case for investigation",
    "is when parameter @xmath6 is rather small but particular case @xmath0  so called copenhagen case  attracted its attention and hnon numerically studied this case as well .",
    "we guess that this case was selected by hnon for investigation due to presence of great computation work provided by the group of strmgren in 1930-th .",
    "so he had possibility to compare his own numerical results with those that were calculated earlier and by different methods .",
    "two papers  @xcite demonstrated the highest level of numerical investigation of the problem . in brief the essential properties of hnon s work are following .    * accurate and thorough numerical computations in regular coordinates using global thiele regularization ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "* poincar map technique was used for bifurcation analysis of periodic solutions .",
    "* recomputation of earlier found orbits and investigation of six new families of periodic solutions with asymptotic behavior .",
    "very interesting class of orbits with asymptotic behavior were studied .",
    "these orbits exist for definite values of parameter @xmath6 , namely , when the eigenvalues of matrix @xmath10 computed at the triangular lagrange libration points @xmath11 or @xmath12 are complex with non - zero real and imaginary parts .",
    "the next paper  @xcite from the first block presented the main ideas for studying second species periodic solutions with the help of generating solution technique .",
    "let us give some definition .",
    "[ defgensol ] let at small parameter value @xmath13 there exists a periodic solution @xmath14 to canonical system defined by hamitonian @xmath15 and it could be smoothly continued over @xmath6",
    ". then its limit at @xmath16 ( if it does exist ) is called * generating solution*. here @xmath17 , @xmath18 is a vector of coordinates and @xmath19 is a vector of canonically conjugated momenta .",
    "we assume that the system of canonical equations has a periodic solution @xmath20 with period @xmath21 : @xmath22 for definite value of small parameter @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the minimal and the maximal distances correspondingly from the body @xmath2 to the orbit @xmath25 .",
    "there are three possible ways of continuation of periodic solution @xmath20 while @xmath16 :    1 .",
    "if @xmath26 then we get generating solution of the _ first species _ ; such solution is regular and can be find by the normal form method ( see  ( * ? ?",
    "ii , vii ) ) .",
    "2 .   if @xmath27 and @xmath28 then we get generating solution of the _ second species_. 3 .",
    "if @xmath29 then we get generating solution of the _ third species_.    if generating solution is not regular then it may consist of solutions of special form called _ arc - solution_. the arc - solutions start and finish at the singular points of the hamiltonian @xmath30 .",
    "so , generating solution of the second species can be constructed from the arc - solutions .",
    "m.hnon found out two types of arc - solutions called @xmath31-arcs and @xmath21-arcs .",
    "let consider the case @xmath32 in sideral i.e. inertial frame .",
    "the bodies @xmath2 and @xmath3 execute keplerian motion , @xmath2 uniformly moves along the unit circle and @xmath3 moves along the ellipse ( see fig .",
    "[ figmu0 ] ) .    .",
    "]    the main difference between the kepler problem and this case is collisions between bodies @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the position of the bodies are defined as follows : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is true anomaly , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the semi - major axis and the eccentricity of the ellipse , parameters @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 can take values @xmath40 , defining the direction of the motion and position of the pericenter of the ellipse .",
    "two cases of collisions are possible .    1 .",
    "the collision takes place at the same point @xmath41 at the moment @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , the sideral periods of motion are commensurable and such arcs were denoted by @xmath21 .",
    "2 .   the first collision take place at the point @xmath41 at the moment @xmath42 and the second collision takes place at the symmetrical point @xmath43 at the moment @xmath44 .",
    "the set of symmetric arc - solutions was denoted by hnon as @xmath31-arcs .",
    "hnon obtained an equation relating time @xmath45 and true anomaly @xmath34 only @xmath46-\\\\ -\\tau|\\sin\\eta|^3=0 \\end{split}\\ ] ] and numerically solved it for @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "he found countable many analytic solutions of the equation   grouped into three sequences @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , where indices @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "the corresponding curves are shown in fig .",
    "[ fighenondiag ] taken from  @xcite .     plane . ]",
    "hnon also compute critical orbits of these families .",
    "this was the first step to understanding the structure of the generating solutions of the rtbp s periodic orbits .",
    "last two papers  @xcite written at the same time were devoted to studying hill problem which is the limiting case of the rtbp .",
    "we consider hnon s work on hill problem in the next section .      since the beginning of 1970th alexander bruno started his own program of investigation of periodic solutions of the rtbp .",
    "his candidate and doctoral theses were devoted to the problem of convergence of normal forms of ordinary differential equations and their systems .",
    "so , using this approach a.bruno independently obtained the description of generating solutions of periodic orbits of the rtbp .",
    "he published his results in soviet scientific journals and preprints of keldysh institute of applied mathematics in russian .",
    "as hnon wrote in the preface to his book  @xcite `` i was so impressed by his work that ",
    "i translated two of his papers into english  '' .",
    "finally bruno s papers have been collected into book published in russian in 1990 and translated into english in 1994 .",
    "this book provided theoretical background of investigation of hamiltonian systems with the method of normal form and proposed a survey of generating solutions of the first species ( regular case ) and of the second species ( singular case ) .",
    "bruno also studied bifurcations of generating solutions of the first species but the same analysis for generating solutions of the second species was not provided yet .",
    "the direct face - to - face encounter between michel hnon and alexander bruno took place at university of nice at august , 1990 , when bruno was invited as visit professor .",
    "the second period of hnon s investigation of the rtbp periodic solutions was summarized in his two monographs published in springer .",
    "the first one named `` generating families in restricted three - body problem '' was based on the sequel of his papers and also papers written in collaboration with pierre guillaume , donald hitzl .",
    "he also used the results obtained by lawrence perko and especially by alexander bruno .",
    "the main achievements of this book were precise description of structure of second species generating solutions , their bifurcation analysis and comparison with so called natural families which were computed by broucke in 1968 in the earth - moon case ( @xmath54 ) and by bruno in 1993 , 1996 in the sun - jupiter case ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "as concerning the structure of the generating solutions the main proposition was presented in chapter 4 of the book :    [ prop1 ] an ordinary generating orbit of the second species can not contain two identical @xmath21-arcs of type 1 in succession .",
    "the background of this proposition  [ prop1 ] was provided rather heuristic , so , to strictly complete generating solutions investigation and to give quantitative analysis of bifurcations , hnon decided to write one more book . as he wrote at the beginning of chapter  15 in  @xcite `` after the present monograph was completed ",
    "there appear a book by bruno ( 1998 , 2000 ) '' .",
    "indeed , in 1998 alexander bruno published his new book `` power geometry in algebraic and differential equations '' in russian , which was translated into english and published in 2000 by elsevier  @xcite .",
    "the book of bruno proposed the method for quantitative analysis of solutions near singularities and therefore gave an instrument for bifurcation analysis of generating solutions .",
    "m.hnon considerably rewrote his second volume and published its new version with strict background of bifurcation analysis of generating families in 2001 .",
    "but competition between hnon and bruno did not finish . during 20052012 a.bruno",
    "mainly together with v.varin published a sequel of papers where many families of periodic solutions were computed and described in the case @xmath16 .",

    "our first acquaintance with hnon s papers took place in 1995 when we were offered to read two papers  @xcite , devoted to hill problem . from that moment studying families of periodic solutions of hamiltonian systems in general and of hill problem in particular became the main field of our scientific researches . at the end of 2004 when the second author was finishing her candidate thesis",
    "we decided to write michel hnon a message for the purpose to get an independent evaluation of the level of fulfilled work .",
    "he asked us to send him our last results concerning non - symmetric periodic solutions of hill problem because at the very moment he was finishing his paper  @xcite . later before the thesis defense the second author sent to hnon abstract of her thesis and he appreciated of the obtained results .",
    "planar hill problem is a limit case of the planar rtbp .",
    "the equations of motion of hill problem describe the motion of massless body near the smaller active mass ( the earth ) , while the last moves around the bigger active mass ( the sun ) along the circular orbit .",
    "hill problem was originally proposed by american astronomer george hill for the moon motion theory .",
    "he had obtained approximate periodic solutions in the form of trigonometric series , which then were used by him as intermediate solutions for his theory of the moon s motion . for more details about the role of the hill problem in constructing the theory of the moon s motion see  @xcite .",
    "hill problem is an nonintegrable hamiltonian problem and it possesses the infinite number of periodic solution . some of these solutions can be used for continuation into periodic orbits of the rtbp or into periodic orbits of generic three - body priblem .",

    "this paper is a continuation and development of ideas and methods described in  @xcite ( and also in book  @xcite by a.d .",
    "bruno ) for seeking periodic solutions based on their generating solutions .",
    "however , m.hnon in the above papers restricted himself to investigation of only families of those periodic solutions which included orbits with a global multiplicity of three and less .",
    "moreover , a major part of families described in paper  @xcite were obtained by him using the `` brute - force '' method .",
    "this method turned out to be unsuitable for seeking families of asymmetric solutions .",
    "therefore , all families described in paper  @xcite were found as a result of bifurcation with loss of symmetry of earlier studied families of symmetric periodic solutions .        in  @xcite hnon",
    "proposed to look for generating solutions in the set of arc - orbits which start and finish at the origin , which is the only singular point of the hamiltonian of hill problem , which is following : @xmath57      1 .",
    "arc - solutions of the first type are arcs of epicycloids , which pass twice through the origin ; hnon proposed to denote such arcs with symbols @xmath58 , @xmath59 ; 2 .",
    "arc - solutions of the second type which are periodic solutions just passing through the origin ; such arcs are denoted by symbols @xmath60 and @xmath36 .    as far as all arc - solutions pass through the origin so it is possible to compose the infinite number of sequences from arc - solutions @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath36 by matching these arcs with hyperbolas of two types ( see  @xcite ) .",

    "m.hnon stated in  @xcite that for newtonian potential of attraction there are two pairs of arc - solutions , namely , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , which can not be matched to each other by hyperbolas described above .",
    "an algorithm for study symmetric periodic solutions defined by its corresponding generating sequences was proposed by the first author in  @xcite .",
    "more then 20 new families of periodic solutions were found out by this algorithm .",
