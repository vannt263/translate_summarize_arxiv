    "the two - neutrino double beta decay ( @xmath0-decay ) @xcite , which is allowed by the standard model , has been observed in direct counter experiments for a couple of isotopes during the last 15 years ( see e.g. the recent review articles @xcite ) . as the decay rate of this process is free of unknown parameters from the particle physics side this very rare process with a typical half - life above @xmath5 years",
    "can be used to test the nuclear structure .",
    "the @xmath0-decay is a second order process in perturbation theory .",
    "thus the calculation of the @xmath0-decay matrix element is a complex task mainly due to the fact that it involves a summation over a full set of virtual intermediate nuclear states of the double  odd nucleus .",
    "essentially there exist two different approaches to evaluate the @xmath0-decay rate including an explicit summation over these states @xcite : the shell model approach has been found successful in describing satisfactory the lowest excited states , however , it can not reliably describe the states in the giant gamow - teller resonance region for open shell medium heavy nuclei .",
    "the proton - neutron qrpa ( pn - qrpa ) and its extensions avoid this drawback but on other hand their predictions are very dependent upon model assumptions .",
    "the crucial problem of the theoretical @xmath0-decay studies is the question whether the contribution of the higher - lying states to the @xmath0-decay amplitude , which is apparently disfavored by the large energy denominator , plays an important role . in ref . @xcite it was suggested that @xmath0-decay transitions , where the first @xmath6 state of the intermediate nucleus ( @xmath7 ) is the ground state , are governed only by the following two beta transitions : i ) the first one connecting the ground state of the initial nucleus ( @xmath8 ) with @xmath6 intermediate state of @xmath9 nucleus .",
    "ii ) the second one proceeding from the @xmath6 state to the final ground state ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "this assumption is known as the _ single state dominance(ssd ) hypothesis_. we note that the dominance of the ground state of intermediate nucleus in particular case of @xmath0-decay of @xmath1 was pointed out by a. griffiths and p. vogel , who analysed this decay in details @xcite .    the ssd hypothesis has been studied both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite .",
    "the required beta transition amplitudes to the @xmath6 state have been deduced from the measured @xmath11 values , i.e. , in the model independent way , or have been calculated e.g. within the pn - qrpa @xcite .",
    "the obtained results indicate that the ssd hypothesis can be realized in the case of several @xmath0-decay emitters through a true dominance of the @xmath6 state or by cancelations among the higher lying @xmath12 state of the intermediate nucleus . till",
    "now the study has been concentrated mostly on the determination of the @xmath0-decay half - life for the transition to the ground state .",
    "recently the @xmath0-decay transitions to excited @xmath2 states of the final nucleus has gained much attention @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to notice that there is now a first positive evidence for such nuclear @xmath0-decay transition @xcite .    in previous ssd hypothesis studies ,",
    "calculations have been performed with approximated energy denominators of the perturbation theory by ignoring their dependence on lepton energies @xcite .",
    "however , this approximation can lead to significant overestimation of the @xmath0-decay half - life as it was shown in ref .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to reconsider the ssd predictions without the above approximation .",
    "it is also supposed that exact calculations of the ssd hypothesis with unfactorized nuclear part and integration over the phase space of the outgoing leptons can strongly influence the behavior of some of the differential decay rates .",
    "previously , they have not been analyzed in the framework of the ssd hypothesis .",
    "however , they are of current interest due to the prepared nemo iii experiment , which will allow to perform a precise measurement of the energy and angular distributions of the outgoing electrons @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we perform exact calculations of the ssd hypothesis of @xmath0-decay of @xmath1 for the transitions to the @xmath2 ground state as well as to excited @xmath2 and @xmath3 states of the final nucleus @xmath4 .",
    "in addition , we will discuss a possible signal in favor of the ssd hypothesis from the differential decay rates .",
    "the inverse half - life of the @xmath0-decay transition to the @xmath2 and @xmath3 states of the final nucleus is usually presented in the following form @xcite : @xmath13^{-1 }   = g^{2\\nu}(j^+ )     \\label{eq:1}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the kinematical factor .",
    "the nuclear matrix element @xmath15 can be written as sum of two matrix elements @xmath16 and @xmath17 including the transitions through the lowest and higher lying states of the intermediate nucleus , respectively .",
    "we have @xmath18 where @xmath19^s } , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "m^{hs}_{gt}(j^+ ) & = & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{s } }   \\sum_{n=2 } \\frac{m^f_n(j^+)m^i_n(0^+ ) } { [ e_n - e_i + \\delta ] ^s } \\label{eq:3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath20 here , s=1 for j=0 and s=3 for j=2 .",
    "@xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are respectively the wave functions of the initial , final and intermediate nuclei with corresponding energies @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 denotes the average energy @xmath28 .",
    "the ssd hypothesis assumes that the nuclear matrix element @xmath29 is negligible in comparison with @xmath30 , which can be determined in phenomenological ( with help of @xmath11 values ) or nuclear model dependent way . knowing the value of @xmath30 one can predict the @xmath0-decay half - life with help of eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) and compare it with the measured one .",
    "henceforth we shall denote this approach as ssd1 .",
    "the ssd1 @xmath0-decay half - life is derived in the approximation in which the sum of two lepton energies in the denominator of the @xmath0-decay nuclear matrix element is replaced with their average value @xmath27 : @xmath31 @xmath32 . here , @xmath33",
    "( @xmath34 is the mass of electron ) and @xmath35 are energies of electrons and antineutrinos , respectively .",
    "the main purpose of this approximation is to factorize the lepton and nuclear parts in the calculation of @xmath36 .",
    "however , it is not necessary to do it within the ssd hypothesis .",
    "we note that in the particular case of @xmath0-decay of @xmath1 the value @xmath37 is negative ( -0.343 mev ) and that there is large difference between the minimal ( 0.168 mev ) and maximal ( 3.202 mev ) values of @xmath38 .",
    "it indicates that one has to go beyond the above approximation . the ssd hypothesis approach with exact consideration of the energy denominators",
    "will be denoted hereafter ssd2 .    from the theoretical point of view one",
    "can discuss also an alternative assumption , which is the dominance of the contribution from higher order states of the intermediate nucleus to @xmath0-decay rate .",
    "we shall denote it as _ higher order state dominance ( hsd ) hypothesis_. we note that within this assumption one can factorize safely the nuclear part and the integration over the phase space .",
    "thus it is expected that the behavior of the hsd hypothesis differential decay rates will differ considerably from those obtained within ssd2 , if the value of the expression @xmath39 is rather small .",
    "for such comparison of the ssd2 and hsd approaches we shall assume @xmath40^{-1/2}.   \\label{eq:6}\\ ] ] here , @xmath41 is the measured @xmath0-decay half - life .",
    "@xmath43    @xmath44    here , @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the relativistic coulomb factor @xcite .",
    "the expressions for the factors @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) are presented in table [ table.1 ] .    in order to determine the @xmath0-decay half - life within the ssd hypothesis the matrix elements @xmath53 and @xmath54 have to be specified .",
    "they can be deduced from the @xmath11 values of electron capture and the single @xmath55 decays as follows : @xmath56 here , @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) and @xmath59 is the vector - axial coupling constant .",
    "the advantage of this phenomenological determination of the beta transition amplitudes @xmath54 and @xmath53 consists in their nuclear model independence and in the fact that the associated @xmath0-decay rate does not depend explicitly on @xmath59 ( @xmath59 factors from beta amplitudes in eq .",
    "( [ eq:10 ] ) are canceled with @xmath60 from @xmath61 factor ) .",
    "in this paper we study the ssd hypothesis for @xmath0-decay of @xmath1 to the ground state as well as to the @xmath2 and @xmath3 excited states of the final nucleus @xmath4 .",
    "the calculated @xmath0-decay half - lifes are presented in table [ table.2 ] and compared with the available experimental data . by comparing the results of the ssd1 and ssd2 approaches we see that the exact consideration of the energy denominators leads to a significant reduction of the half - lifes for all studied transitions and that this effect is especially large for transitions to the @xmath3 states of the final nucleus .",
    "the obtained ssd2 values are close to the experimental ones both for the transition to the ground and excited @xmath62 states of 100ru .",
    "however , it is not possible to draw a general conclusion with respect to the ssd approach as there is some disagreement between different experimental measurements ( see table [ table.2 ] ) .",
    "we note also that the phenomenological predictions for the 2vbb - decay half - lives ( ssd1 and ssd2 ) have a big uncertainty too ( @xmath63 % ) due to inaccurate experimental determination of the @xmath64 value for the electron capture @xcite .",
    "it is expected that the above drawbacks will be eliminated by the future experimental measurements @xcite .    till now the @xmath0-decay transition to the @xmath3 state of the final nucleus has been not observed .",
    "the ssd2 results given in table [ table.2 ] suggest that this transition for the a=100 system can be detected on the level of @xmath65 years . in spite of the advantage of @xmath0-decay measurement to @xmath3 excited state in coincidence with gamma transition to the @xmath2 ground state the detection of this @xmath0-decay transition seems to be unreachable in near future .",
    "we note that our calculation has been performed by considering that all outgoing leptons are emitted in the s - wave state .",
    "this case is favored from the viewpoint of lepton wave but suppressed due to the small factor @xmath66",
    ". however , there are other possibilities from the higher partial waves of leptons with favored additive combination @xmath67 of denominators . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was estimated that the suppression factor due to a p - wave to s - wave ratio is about @xmath68 for the of @xmath0-decay amplitude .",
    "we have found that the contribution from higher lepton partial wave can be comparable with the pure s - wave contribution only in the case in which the above ratio is about 50 , something unexpected . thus within the ssd hypothesis",
    "the @xmath0-decay transition to the @xmath3 state is governed by the pure lepton s - wave contribution .",
    "further , we have found that it is possible experimentally decide whether one low - lying state dominates or not by precise measuring the single electron spectra and/or angular distributions . the single electron spectrum of the emitted electrons calculated within ssd ( i.e. , ssd2 ) and hsd approaches is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] .",
    "the ssd and hsd distributions associated with the transitions to the @xmath2 ground ( fig .",
    "[ fig.1]a ) and excited ( fig .",
    "[ fig.1]b ) states of the final nucleus were normalized to the experimental half - lifes of ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite ( see table [ table.2 ] ) , respectively .",
    "as there are no available @xmath0-decay data for the transition to the @xmath69 excited state of the final nucleus , the distributions in fig .",
    "[ fig.1]c were normalized to the half - life predicted by the ssd2 approach ( see table [ table.2 ] ) . by glancing figs .",
    "[ fig.1 ] we see that there is different behavior of the single electron differential decay rate calculated within ssd ( i.e. , ssd2 ) and hsd approaches especially for small electron energy .",
    "it is supposed that this ssd versus hsd effect is enough large to be studied by the nemo iii experiment , which is currently in preparation @xcite .",
    "the nemo iii experiment is supposed to achieve precise measurement of the angular correlation of outgoing electrons as well .",
    "the curves representing the ssd ( i.e. , ssd2 ) and hsd approaches for this observable characteristic are just lines with different asymptotic behavior [ see eq .",
    "[ eq:9 ] ] .",
    "we have @xmath70.\\ ] ] in the case of @xmath0-decay of @xmath71 one obtains @xmath72 we see that there is only a small difference between the ssd and hsd values of @xmath73 .",
    "nevertheless , it is expected that this effect can be tested by the nemo iii experiment too @xcite .",
    "we maintain that the study of @xmath0-decay differential characteristics offers a new possibility to decide whether one low - lying state dominates or not .",
    "it is more reliable way as a simple comparison of calculated and measured half  lifes .",
    "we have studied the @xmath0-decay of @xmath1 in the context of the ssd hypothesis . to our knowledge , the validity of the separation of the lepton and nuclear parts has been discussed for the first time .",
    "the transitions to the ground ( @xmath2 ) and excited ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) states of the final nucleus has been considered .",
    "we have shown that by exact treatment of the lowest state of the intermediate nucleus the @xmath0-decay half  life is reduced by factor of @xmath74 percent for transitions to @xmath2 states .",
    "however , much larger reduction appears for @xmath0-decay transitions to @xmath3 states amounting to @xmath75 percent ( see table [ table.2 ] ) .",
    "in addition , we have found that the emitted electrons in these @xmath0-decay transitions are predominantly in the s - wave states in the case the ssd dominance is realized .",
    "further , we have shown that one can learn more about details of the @xmath0-decay nuclear transition by measuring the single electron spectra and/or angular distributions of the emitted electrons .",
    "we have found that the ssd and the hsd differential decay ",
    "rates exhibit different behaviour ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] ) .",
