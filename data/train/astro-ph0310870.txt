    "during the last decade , the deep , wide field color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) studies and spectroscopy of the dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) satellites of the milky way have beautifully confirmed early hints on the fact that these galaxies had experienced more than one episode of star formation and nucleosynthesis ( zinn 1981 , and references therein ) .",
    "indeed , we find almost every imaginable evolutionary history in this sample of galaxies , from the extreme case of leo i , which has formed over 80% of its stars in the second half of the life of the universe ( gallart et al .",
    "1999 ) , to intermediate cases like carina ( smecker - hane et al . 1996",
    "; hurley - keller , mateo & nemec 1998 ) and fornax ( stetson , hesser & smecker - hane 1998 ; buonanno et al .",
    "1999 ) , with prominent intermediate - age populations , to predominantly old ( @xmath4 10 gyr old ) systems like sculptor ( hurley - keller , mateo & grebel 1999 ) , draco ( aparicio , carrera & martnez - delgado 2001 ) , ursa minor ( mighell & burke 1999 ; carrera et al . 2002 ) and leo ii ( mighell & rich 1996 ) .",
    "the very extended star formation history ( sfh ) in several of these galaxies seems to be independent of their total mass : carina and leo i are among the least massive dsph in the milky way system , with virial masses around @xmath5 , while fornax is the most massive one , with @xmath6 , see mateo ( 1998 ) .",
    "their metal content , however , is directly related to their total luminosity , and presumably , to their total mass ( caldwell et al .",
    "1998 and references therein ) : leo  i and carina have low metallicities ( gallart et al . 1999 ; smecker - hane et al . 1999 ) , while fornax seems to have a relatively high metallicity and a large metallicity dispersion ( saviane et al . 2000 ; tolstoy et al . 2001 ; and much more prominently in this paper ) .",
    "the metal content , therefore , seems to be not as much related to the sfh than to the ability of these systems to retain the produced metals , which may have to do with the effect of sne on the interstellar medium and the depths of their potential wells ( e.g. , mac - low & ferrara 1999 ; ferrara & tolstoy 2000 ) .",
    "the nearest galaxies offer an excellent opportunity to test these correlations and their theoretical interpretation , since their sfh can be derived with great accuracy from deep cmds , their masses can be calculated from the velocity dispersion of their stars , and the metallicities and metallicity distribution can be obtained from spectroscopy of their individual stars .",
    "it is important to emphasize the need to replace the common technique of inferring the mean and the dispersion in metal abundance from the mean color and color spread of the rgb in the cmd under the assumption that the stars in these galaxies are very old .",
    "because of the age - metallicity degeneracy in the position on the rgb , this method can lead to significant errors if the galaxies contain , as some do , sizable populations of intermediate - aged stars .",
    "spectroscopic metallicity determinations exist for a small sample of the nearest dsph using the ca  ii  triplet and other metallicity indicators in low dispersion spectra ( draco : lehnert et al .",
    "1992 , and references therein ; winnick & zinn , in prep . ; sextans : da costa et al .",
    "1991 ; suntzeff et al . 1993 ; carina : smecker - hane et al . 1999 ; sculptor : tolstoy et al . 2001 ; fornax : tolstoy et al . 2001 ) .",
    "all of the studies that have observed more than a few stars have discovered that substantial metallicity dispersions are present , even though the mean metallicity of each of these low - mass systems is low .",
    "high dispersion abundance determinations of a number of elements require necessarily an 8m - class telescope , and exist for a few stars in the nearest northern dsph , namely draco , umi and sextans , for which keck hires spectroscopy has been possible ( shetrone , ct & sargent 2001 ; shetrone , bolte & stetson 1998 ) and in the nearest southern dsph , sculptor , fornax , carina and leo  i , using uves at the vlt ( shetrone et al . 2003",
    "; tolstoy et al .",
    "these studies have measured just a few stars in each galaxy , and confirm the low resolution spectroscopy results in the cases where there is overlap , in terms of mean metallicity and existence of a dispersion in metallicity . among the new information that they provide",
    "is the abundance patterns among the dsph galaxies , which are quite uniform , indicating similar nucleosynthetic histories and presumably similar imf .",
    "the @xmath7 $ ] element ratios are however in general lower in the dsph than in the galactic halo , for the same range of metallicity .    in this paper we present spectroscopy and metal abundances for a large number of stars in the fornax dsph galaxy .",
    "fornax is a particularly interesting galaxy in the context of the study of chemical enrichment processes in dsph galaxies , since it seems to be among the few milky way dsph satellites ( the other outstanding one being sagittarius , see layden & sarajedini 2000 and references therein ) that has been able to retain substantial amounts of metals during its evolution , as hinted by the width of its rgb ( saviane et al",
    ". 2000 ) and confirmed and shown to be even more extreme by the spectroscopic work presented in this paper .",
    "tamura , hirashita & takeuchi ( 2001 ) consider it as the only galaxy in our immediate neighborhood with properties comparable to the more massive dwarf elliptical ( de ) andromeda companions .",
    "fornax is indeed one of the most massive of the milky way satellite dsph galaxies , with total mass @xmath8 ( mateo 1998 ) , as inferred from the central velocity dispersion of its stars ( mateo et al .",
    "1991 ) , and it is one of the two ( again with sagittarius ) containing its own system of globular clusters . the existing deep cmds ( stetson et al . 1998 ; buonanno et al . 1999 ; saviane et al .",
    "2000 ) show a blue horizontal - branch and a well populated red - clump indicating a substantial population of old and intermediate - age stars respectively , and a relatively bright main sequence which must contain stars as young as a few hundred million years .",
    "particularly puzzling is the fact that no hi gas is found in deep vla observations near the center of the galaxy ( young 1999 ) , where the youngest stars are found .",
    "the current data can not definitely exclude , however , the presence of hi in the outer parts of fornax , where it may reside if it was ejected by the last event of star formation .    to understand in more detail the evolution of fornax , one would like to measure its age - metallicity relation ( amr ) and its sfh .",
    "this can be done if the age - metallicity degeneracy of the rgb and other features of the cmd can be broken by observations that yield the abundances of the stars independently of their ages .",
    "the infrared ca  ii  triplet has been shown to be a useful metallicity indicator for metal - poor stars ( see e. g. rutledge et al .",
    "1997a , hereafter rhs , and references therein ) .",
    "while most previous investigations that have used the infrared ca  ii  triplet as a metallicity indicator have worked on globular clusters or other very old star systems , a few have collected observations of red giants in significantly younger stellar populations and have shown that the metallicities obtained in this way are consistent with other estimates ( olszewski et al . 1991 ; suntzeff et al .",
    "1992 ; da costa & hatzidimitriou 1998 ) .",
    "this previous work motivated us to secure spectra at the ca  ii lines of a sample of 117 stars in fornax that lie near the tip of its rgb .",
    "we suspected that this sample would contain stars covering nearly the entire ranges in age and in metallicity . to demonstrate that these observations are not compromised by an age - metallicity degeneracy",
    ", we discuss the sensitivity of ca  ii strength to age and metallicity variations using the theoretical calculations by jorgensen , carlsson & johnson ( 1992 ) , and we show that the observations of star clusters are consistent with the theoretical expectations .",
    "we then derive the metallicities of the fornax stars from a new calibration of the ca  ii triplet , estimate the amr and discuss the sfh of this galaxy .",
    "the observations were obtained on the night of 1st december 1999 , using the fors1 instrument installed on the cassegrain focus of the ut1 telescope ( first 8.2-m unit of the eso very large telescope ) at paranal , chile .",
    "fors1 is a low - dispersion spectrograph that allows the simultaneous spectroscopy of up to 19 objects in a 6.8x6.8 field of view through a system of adjustable slitlets .",
    "grism gris-600i+15 was used with order separation filter og590 + 72 , resulting in a central wavelength of 7940  , a dispersion of 1.06    per pixel ( 44  / mm ) , and a resolution of @xmath3 1530 .",
    "the spectral range covered was in general 7000 - 9000  , with variations depending on the exact position of the slitlet in the field .",
    "in positioning the slitlets , we ensured that the whole spectral region of interest to measure the ca  ii  triplet feature was always covered .",
    "calibration exposures were taken for each setup in the morning following the observations with a ne - ar lamp .",
    "the excellent seeing conditions during the observations most of the time below 0.8 \" seeing allowed us to use slitlet widths of 0.7 arcsec .",
    "seven fields were observed in fornax , with an average of 17 targets per field . for each field ,",
    "two 20-minute exposures were acquired on two positions offset vertically by about 3 arcsec ( @xmath310 pixels ) .",
    "this procedure allows the direct subtraction of the sky from the unextracted spectra , in spectroscopic analogy to the method widely used in infrared photometry .",
    "the method is a simplified version of the `` va - et- vient '' procedure presented by cuillandre et al .",
    "it is much more effective at removing the night sky emission lines than the conventional method of interpolating between sky spectra that are recorded on either side of the object spectrum .",
    "short exposures were also acquired on selected red giants of three nearby globular clusters , ngc 2298 , ngc 3201 and ngc 7099=m 30 , for the purpose of the metallicity calibration .",
    "a single exposure with an exposure time of 2 - 5 minutes was obtained for each cluster .",
    "because red giants near the tip of the rgb are much less dense in the plane of the sky in the globular clusters than in fornax , only a small fraction of the slitlets could be used in the cluster exposures .",
    "the program targets were selected in the upper part of the rgb in fornax within the central 11 arcmin of the galaxy .",
    "we used the @xmath9 and @xmath10 band photometry of stetson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for this selection .",
    "for the purpose of the target selection only , the @xmath11 magnitude was extrapolated from the @xmath9 and @xmath10 using a relation fitting globular cluster data : @xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath13 and @xmath11 values used later in the article and listed in table  [ table1 ] are from the new photometry of fornax by gallart et al .",
    "( in prep . ) .",
    "the targets were selected with linear limits on color and magnitude encompassing all the upper part of the fornax rgb down to @xmath14 : @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath11 magnitude was used to define the selection because it corresponds to the wavelengths of the ca  ii  triplet region .",
    "the color selection limits were designed in order to include the whole width of the fornax rgb , including potential outliers on the blue side , while excluding regions obviously dominated by field stars .",
    "this selection produced 2534 potential targets .",
    "the actual targets were picked according to their position in the field of the instrument , in order to fill optimally the 19 slitlets available for multi - object spectroscopy on fors1 .",
    "the position of all observed targets is shown on fig .",
    "[ figsky ] on the plane of the sky and fig .",
    "[ figselect ] in the cmd .",
    "while age , metallicity or kinematic criteria were not used in the selection , some age and metallicity selection is however implicit in the color and magnitude limits .",
    "the upper part of the rgb is not a totally representative sample of a given stellar population . in section  [ simul ]",
    "we attempt to infer the metallicity distribution of the complete population from the distribution of our sample .",
    "the spectra were reduced using the _ noao _ packages _",
    "twodspec.apextract _ and _ onedpec _ in iraf .",
    "the procedure was somewhat different for the program stars , for which two offset frames were obtained , and for the calibrating globular clusters , for which only one frame of short exposure was obtained .",
    "the frames were flat - fielded with lamp flatfields taken after the night with the same spectrograph and slitlet configuration than the program frames . a variable width at the side of each slitlet",
    "was removed to avoid reflections . in three cases , namely targets 217 , 302 and 714 . ] , this procedure removes part of the spectra .",
    "cosmic rays were removed with the iraf task _ cosmicrays _ , and the two offset frames were subtracted to obtain an image with a positive and negative spectrum , some 10 pixel apart , for each slitlet . the positive and negative spectra were extracted with a width of 8 pixels and calibrated in wavelength using ne - ar lamp exposures taken at the end of the night and the spectral line wavelengths listed in the fors user manual ( in the case of frame 5 , the wavelength calibration exposure was corrupted and re - done several weeks after the observation ) .",
    "the residual wavelength scatter was smaller than 0.1  .",
    "attention was given to the stability of the calibration between 8400 and 8700  the region of the ca  ii triplet lines allowing for possible non - linear distortions on the edges of the spectral range .",
    "the two offset , wavelength calibrated spectra , one positive and one negative , were then subtracted to produce the final spectrum .",
    "this procedure allows a very efficient removal of the sky background .",
    "most of the sky cancels out in the direct subtraction of the two images , independently of the variations in pixel response .",
    "it is therefore unaffected by the errors in the flat - fielding .",
    "the only sky light left in the subtracted images is that due to variation of its intensity between the two 20-minutes exposures , which is removed when the two extracted , wavelength calibrated spectra are subtracted again .",
    "an example of the raw , sky and final object spectra is given in fig .",
    "[ figspectra ] .",
    "the reduction procedure was checked by extracting the spectra of all the objects of frame 4 by two authors independently , using slightly different parameters .",
    "the resulting spectra were essentially identical .",
    "varying the extraction width between 1 and 10 pixels was also tested on frame 4 , and 8 pixels was judged to be a reasonable value to apply to all spectra . while marginally better results could have been obtained by tailoring the extraction width to each spectrum , this would have introduced a subjective element regarding what constituted a  bad feature \" .",
    "consequently , we used the same extraction width for all spectra .",
    "only a single exposure was obtained of the globular cluster red giants that serve to calibrate the pseudo - equivalent widths , because they are much brighter than the sky background .",
    "their spectra were extracted after de - biasing and flat - fielding .",
    "the sky was removed by a linear fit to the background perpendicular to the direction of the dispersion .",
    "we observed several rgb stars in three globular clusters , ngc  2298 , ngc  3201 and ngc  7099 , which were selected from the photometry of alcaino & lillier ( 1986 ) , lee ( 1977 ) and dickens ( 1972 ) respectively .",

    "radial velocities were obtained by fitting each of the three ca  ii  lines with a gaussian profile in iraf .",
    "velocities were then computed using the measured line centers and the known lab wavelengths ( taken from rhs ) .",
    "whenever possible , all three lines were used to compute the final averaged velocity for an individual star .",
    "the low resolution of the spectra limits the usefulness of the radial velocity to the identification of clear outliers as likely non - members of fornax , without allowing a more detailed kinematical study .",
    "objects 109 , 214 and 418 have discordant velocities and are suspected non - members .",
    "the velocity of 216 is also discordant , but the spectrum is too noisy for the indication to be reliable . in the following analysis ,",
    "the first three objects are excluded , while the fourth falls much below our spectral quality criteria and is excluded anyway ( par .  [ indic ] ) .",
    "pseudo equivalent widths were calculated from the spectra using passbands in and around the ca  ii  triplet lines . to place our measurements on the system of rhs",
    ", we followed closely their prescription for measuring the pseudo - equivalent widths .",
    "we used the same functional form , the moffat function of exponent 2.5 , for fitting the lines and the same wavelength intervals for continuum passbands . for the measurement of the combined equivalent width we used their definition of the weighted sum of the widths , @xmath17ca , which they defined as @xmath17ca@xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the equivalent widths of individual calcium lines ( @xmath21 8498 , 8542 , 8662 , respectively ) .",

    "the mean difference in the sense ours minus theirs between the values of @xmath17ca  is @xmath22 , with a standard deviation of 0.11 . since these deviations are small compared to the average measuring errors ( 0.16 and 0.10 for our and rhs  values , respectively ) , no corrections appear necessary to put our measurements on the rhs  system .    as a consistency check ,",
    "the equivalent width were also calculated by fitting a gaussian profile on the spectra with the `` _ splot _ '' task in iraf , after the spectra continuum were flattened by division with a 6-th order polynomial .",
    "the gaussian and moffatian values were found to be in excellent agreement .",
    "a regression between the equivalent widths calculated with the two methods gives @xmath17ca@xmath23@xmath17ca@xmath24 ,  @xmath25=0.12  .",
    "the passband value was adopted except when there was a visible spike in the continuum near the calcium lines . in that case",
    "the gaussian fit was preferred .",
    "in the case of frame 5 , only the gaussian values were computed .",
    "table  [ table1 ] indicates when gaussian fitting was chosen .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio per pixel was evaluated by computing the dispersion of the normalized background in three different wavelength intervals around the ca  ii  lines : @xmath26   , @xmath27   , @xmath28   .",
    "spectra were included in the analysis when the signal - to - noise ratio in these intervals was higher than 20 ( metallicities are nevertheless given in table  [ table1 ] down to a signal - to - noise ratio of 14 ) .",
    "note that this criteria , which takes into account the noise on the side of the ca  ii  lines only , will not produce any bias at selectively eliminating spectra of lower metallicity stars .",
    "stars rejected by this criteria or for other reasons mentioned in the notes are shown as open dots in figure  [ figselect ] ( 23 out of 118 stars ) . in figure",
    "[ fig_spec ] , three sample spectra are shown .",
    "the final uncertainty of the combined ca  ii  equivalent widths is in the range 3 - 6% for our objects .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , previous studies have shown that the strengths of the infrared ca  ii triplet lines can be used as a metallicity indicator for old , metal - poor stars , such as the ones in globular clusters .",
    "it is less clear that these lines provide an accurate metallicity ranking for red giants of near solar composition and for ones spanning a wide range in age .",
    "since fornax contains red giants with these properties in addition to very old , metal - poor ones , it is imperative that we investigate the behavior of the ca  ii lines in some detail .    in the appendix",
    ", we use theoretical calculations of ca  ii  line strength as a function of effective temperature and log g , together with theoretical isochrones , to investigate the sensitivity of the caii lines to age and metallicity .",
    "most previous investigations that used @xmath17ca  as a metallicity indicator have plotted it against v - v(hb ) because this quantity is independent of the reddening and the distance modulus of the system .",
    "this quantity works fine for very old stellar populations that have well - defined horizontal branches and small or virtually non - existent internal metallicity spreads , such as most globular clusters .",
    "the metallicity calibration of the plot of @xmath17ca  vs. v - v(hb ) corrects implicitly for the systematic variation in hb luminosity with metallicity .",
    "it is much less clear that v - v(hb ) is a useful parameter for a galaxy like fornax that possesses wide ranges in age and metallicity . in the case of an intermediate - age star cluster",
    ", one can make the necessary correction to v - v(hb ) because the ages of the red giants are known ( e.g. da costa & hatzidimitriou 1998 ) .",
    "but in fornax , because the age of an individual red giant can not be determined , one does not know if its v - v(hb ) should be corrected for age .",
    "since the distance modulus of fornax is well determined and differential reddening is negligible , it is possible to determine unambiguously the absolute magnitude of every star . if plots of @xmath17ca  against absolute magnitude yield a metallicity ranking that is reasonably insensitive to age , then it does not matter that the ages of the red giants span a large range and that the ages of individual stars can not be determined .",

    "[ figcalplane ] ) , they must be substantially younger stars .",
    "this age effect is very evident in the case of the m11 stars , whose metallicities and ages are well documented .",

    "therefore , our ca  ii  triplet data implies not only unexpectedly high abundances for the fornax stars , but also quite young ages .",

    "zoccali & piotto ( 1999 ) found good agreement between the observed and theoretical luminosity functions of the main - sequence , subgiant - branch and rgb of old globular clusters in a range of metallicities . a similar study involving clusters of different ages",
    "is highly needed .",
    "is our picture compatible with parts of the cmd other than the rgb ?",
    "the fornax cmd contains numerous features associated with a particular age and metallicity , namely a weak horizontal branch , a prominent red clump with a long tail at the bright end , and a main sequence extending to @xmath690.5 .",
    "these features indicate respectively a weak old metal - poor population , an intermediate - age population of various ages and metallicities , and a very recent population , down to @xmath4500 myr old .",
    "all of these are qualitatively compatible with the picture obtained from the rgb and the calcium triplet .    to check the compatibility of our amr with the observed cmd",
    "more quantitatively , we produced a synthetic cmd using the amr obtained above approximated by a linear interpolation between the values ( gyr , z)= ( 15 , 0.0002 ) , ( 13 , 0.0008 ) , ( 2 , 0.0036 ) , ( 0,0.008) and constant star formation rate between 12 and 0.5 gyr ( see figure  [ cmodels ] , and its caption , for more details ) . in figure",
    "[ cmodels ] , this synthetic cmd ( middle panel ) is compared to the fornax observations ( left panel ) .",
    "a visual comparison shows that the main features are well reproduced in the model , except for the fact that the position of the rgb is not perfectly matched , which is a well - known problem of current stellar evolutionary models since the main sequence is the theoretically best understood feature in a cmd , particularly important is the good agreement between the position and shape of the observed and synthetic upper main - sequence , which are both well centered within the corresponding reference lines .",
    "since the amr has been obtained from information on the rgb exclusively , this is a completely independent consistency check indicating that the spectroscopically derived metallicities are in good agreement with the observed cmd .    as a comparison , we computed a synthetic cmd with a slightly different amr ( as can be deduced from saviane et al .",
    "2000 ) whose main difference with the amr inferred by us is a lower metallicity for the 1 - 2 gyr old population .",
    "this cmd is represented in the right panel of figure  [ cmodels ] .",
    "note that the post - main sequence features are quite similar in the two synthetic models , and that the main difference is in the position of the upper main sequence , which is too blue when the lower metallicity amr is used .",
    "this further indicates that the high metallicity , young end of the amr is a feature not only suggested by the spectroscopic measurements , but necessary to obtain a good match with the young part of the observed cmd .",
    "the metallicity distribution and amr that we derive for fornax make it a complex system , more reminiscent of the lmc ( pagel & tautvaisien 1998 ) or the milky way s disk ( rocha - pinto et al .",
    "1996 , edvardsson et al .",
    "1993 ) than of other dwarf spheroidals . like those two systems and unlike most other dwarf spheroidals",
    ", fornax has a rather metal - rich main population , with a tail of old and metal - poor stars . also like these two systems ,",
    "its amr is compatible with a rapid initial enrichment , followed by a period of slower enrichment , and then a recent acceleration of the enrichment .",
    "[ closedbox ] compares the cumulative metallicity distribution of fornax with that of a `` closed - box '' model and the galaxy .",
    "although there is also a departure from the closed - box model in fornax , the distribution is significantly nearer to a closed - box relation than the galaxy .",
    "this is probably even more true when the outer parts of fornax are taken into account 0.1 arcmin@xmath70 ( demers et al .",
    "1994 ) out to total radius 71 arcmin ( mateo 1998 ) ) and 24% ( exponential profile throughout with @xmath71 0.1 arcmin@xmath70 ) . ] .",
    "the inclusion of the outer parts in the cumulative metallicity distribution will proportionally increase the number of very metal - poor objects .",
    "consequently , there appears to be no need to invoke a large infall of unenriched gas on the galaxy or a large loss of enriched gas .",
    "moreover , the almost complete absence of young , metal - poor stars would seem to exclude a scenario of accretion of relatively pristine gas for late star formation episodes .",
    "the fornax results strongly reinforce the mystery posed by the complete absence of gas in dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( knapp , kerr & bowers 1978 ) .",
    "fornax seems to have been producing large amounts of stars continuously until very recent times .",
    "then , as we observe it , it has stopped forming stars and disposed of every trace of gas .",
    "we could be observing fornax just after its last star formation episode , similar to carina and leo  i. dwarf irregulars could be equivalent galaxies forming stars at the present time .",
    "however , the situation would still be statistically unlikely .",
    "if fornax has been forming stars up to 200 myr ago ( saviane et al . 2000 ) , it would be a surprising coincidence to observe it this close to the time when its gas was rapidly enriched and then completely expelled",
    ".    a more satisfactory solution would be if some gas is hidden but still at the disposal of fornax .",
    "blitz & robishaw ( 2000 ) reported several dsph galaxies with hi in the vincinity . while several of these detections were not confirmed ( e.g. , young 1999 ) , and some even retracted ( blitz , priv . comm . ) , the hi around the sculptor galaxy has been confirmed by carignan et al .",
    "fornax was unfortunately not included in the blitz & robishaw study because it was outside the area covered by the dwingaloo survey .",
    "given its history of continuous and recent star formation , we would predict that significant amounts of gas associated with fornax might still be detected in its vicinity .",
    "another conclusion of blitz & robishaw ( 2000 ) is that dsph nearer than 250 pc to a giant galaxy ( the galaxy or m31 ) contain much less gas , an effect that the authors attribute to ram - pressure stripping .",
    "fornax is well within this distance limits , and we would accordingly expect it to contain little or no gas .",
    "we may still , then , be viewing fornax by accident just after its `` gas death '' , during what may be its first passage very near the milky way .",
    "the precise determination of the proper motion of fornax and a computation of its likely orbit will provide a test of this scenario ( see piatek et al .",
    "2002 for a preliminary estimate ) .",
    "it is interesting to compare the properties of fornax with the predictions by mac low & ferrara ( 1999 , mf99 ) and ferrara & tolstoy ( 2000 , ft00 ) . in order to identify where is fornax in the mf99 parameter space , we will derive its baryonic mass , and an estimate of its likely sne rate from data in the literature .",
    "the total ( dark _ plus _ baryonic ) mass of fornax is @xmath72 ( mateo 1998 ) ; by assuming the @xmath73 given in the same paper , and a baryonic @xmath74 ( calculated for a population with constant star formation rate from 12 to 0.5 gyr ago ) , this corresponds to a baryonic mass of @xmath75 . for a constant star formation rate",
    ", it corresponds to a rate of 1400 @xmath76 myr@xmath70 . for a salpeter imf , and this star formation rate , 170 @xmath76 myr@xmath70 of stars would be produced in the mass interval of sne ii progenitors , 10 - 100 @xmath76 , with mean mass @xmath77 .",
    "these figures imply a rate of @xmath4 8.5 sne / myr , or a sne luminosity @xmath78 ergs s@xmath70 .",
    "if we input these data in tables 2 and 3 of mf99 , we find that the mass ejection efficiency expected for fornax would be modest , @xmath79 , while all the metals should be ejected . the fact that there is a substantial metal enrichment in fornax seems to be in contradiction with these models , and",
    "would indicate that the metal ejection efficiency must be in some way overestimated in them .",
    "is the model more representative for the smallest dsphs ? making the same calculation as above for a system with baryonic mass @xmath80 , and assuming a constant star formation rate active in them for a maximum of @xmath81 , we get an upper limit for the star formation rate of 60 @xmath76 myr@xmath70 , or 0.3 sne@xmath82myr@xmath70 .",
    "this is the lower limit of sne rate considered by mac low & ferrara , who predict that these galaxies are also expected to keep some gas through their lifetimes but to lose all metals produced by type ii sne .",
    "this may be compatible with their enrichment being substantially lower than that of fornax .",
    "however , lower star formation rates and therefore lower sne rates than calculated above must be invoked for some fraction of the galaxy s lifetime in order to explain the still noticeable enrichment of the gas reflected in the metallicity of their stars ( shetrone , ct & sargent 2001 and several earlier studies ) .",
    "tamura et al . (",
    "2001 ) have proposed a possible solution that may work at the lowest metallicities .",
    "they note that star formation may be strongly regulated in low metallicity gas by the lack of coolants ( nishi & tashiro 2000 ) .",
    "but once the metallicity rises to [ fe / h]@xmath832 , the metals become effective coolants , and the subsequent star formation should produce sne that expel their metals as described by mf99 and ft00 .",
    "this is inconsistent with the observational data for draco , sextans , and ursa minor ( shetrone et al .",
    "2001 ) , which show that they contains substantial numbers of stars that are more metal - rich than this limit .",
    "one possible reason for the apparent overestimate of metal ejection efficiency in the mf99 and ft00 models is the fact that they consider that all the mass injection occurs in the central 100 pc of the galaxy . as mf99 discuss , several small bubbles distributed in a larger area must be less effective in blowing away the ism than a single central cluster .",
    "the core radius of fornax is 460  pc and that of the smaller galaxies is @xmath84  pc . since dwarf irregular galaxies show spatially and chronologically segregated sites of star formation ( as beautifully shown by dohm - palmer et al .",
    "2002 ) , it is possible that the assumption of one large central site for the dsph galaxies is also incorrect .",
    "further hints may be provided by high resolution spectra abundances of individual elements .",
    "shetrone et al .",
    "( 2001 , 2003 ) note that all the dsph have an under - abundance of even - z elements compared with the milky way halo , which may indicate a large contribution by type ia sne , either because sne ii are less abundant in these galaxies or because their ejecta are not retained .",
    "could it be that the ejecta from type ia sne are retained more than that of type ii , and that this provide some extra enrichment ?",
    "one property of sne ia which is different from sne ii is that they are expected to be isolated events , i.e. less spatially clustered and likely to be less synchronized in time than sne  ii . according to ft00",
    ", isolated sne events would not cause blowout and would have a lower metal ejection efficiency .",
    "there seems to be one difference between the fornax abundance patterns and that of other dsph , according to shetrone et al .",
    "( 2003 ) : while there is a general trend of decreasing [ @xmath57/fe ] abundance with increasing metallicity in the observed dsph , in fornax the even - z ratios appear flat to slightly rising , even if still under - abundant .",
    "all this seems to indicate that the enrichment mechanisms are similar in dsph regardless of their mass .",
    "the slightly different tendency of even - z ratios with metallicity in fornax may simply reflect the more extended period of star formation in this galaxy compared to the other dsph .",
    "this discussion , however , is based on very few stars .",
    "high resolution spectra of a large number of stars will provide very important information to understand the enrichment mechanisms in dsph galaxies , and the processes driving their evolution .",
    "we obtained spectroscopy in the ca  ii  triplet region of the spectrum for 117 stars in the fornax dsph galaxy using fors1 at the vlt .",
    "we derived metallicities for them using our own @xmath17ca - m@xmath33-[fe / h ] calibrations , based on observations of ca  ii  line strengths in 11 globular clusters plus m67 , m11 and the lmc .",
    "we show evidence that a calibration against m@xmath33 instead of the most commonly used one in terms of v - v(hb ) may produce more accurate results for the young populations present in fornax .",
    "our main conclusion is that there is a tail of very metal - rich rgb stars in fornax , with metallicities ranging from approximately @xmath00.7 to @xmath00.4 , whose existence could not have been suspected from their color in the cmd .",
    "the metallicities of these stars , combined with their relatively blue colors , imply that they have ages of the order of 2 gyr .",
    "we use synthetic cmds to examine how the age and metallicity distribution of our sample is related to that of the whole population . combining the metallicity data with constraints from the position of the same stars in the cmd , we find that the ca  ii data are compatible with only a narrow range of possible amr , which in turn , allow to put some constraints on the sfh .",
    "it appears that fornax underwent very substantial chemical enrichment in the last few gyr , from [ fe / h]@xmath85 up to [ fe / h]@xmath86 .",
    "its amr is nearer to a closed - box model than that of the galaxy .",
    "the large number of young ( @xmath87 gyr old ) stars that we infer from the combination of their metallicity and their position on the cmd would imply a star formation rate somewhat rising ( by a factor of @xmath32 ) in the last 2 - 4 gyr . however , this last result depends on an extrapolation from the rgb population to the total population that is not very reliable with the present models .",
    "this scenario corresponds remarkably well with observed features in the cmd other than the rgb , and in particular , with a robust feature ( in terms of our stellar evolution knowledge ) as is the main sequence .",
    "indeed , the derived amr , and in particular , the high metallicity tail , produces synthetic cmds with upper main - sequence colors totally compatible with the observed one , whereas a lower metallicity for the youngest stars would produce too blue a main sequence .",

    "the globular clusters in the milky way are very old , and for the purposes of our discussion their age differences can be ignored . with the exception of a very few clusters , most notably @xmath90 cen , the stars within a globular cluster",

    "these facts explain why in the cmd , the rgbs of globular clusters are tight sequences of stars that are offset from one another in order of the metallicities of the clusters , as predicted by stellar evolutionary theory for clusters of uniform age but varying composition .",

    "<S> the region of parameter space occupied by the most metal - rich red giants in fornax young , metal - rich and luminous is not covered by any of the calibrating clusters , which introduces uncertainty in the high end of the metallicity scale . </S>",
    "<S> using published theoretical calculations of caii triplet equivalent widths , we have investigated their sensitivity to luminosity , age , and metallicity . the correlation between absolute i magnitude and caii strength appears to be only slightly affected by age variations , and we have used it to estimate the metallicities of the fornax stars </S>",
    "<S> .    the metallicity distribution in fornax is centered at [ fe / h]=@xmath00.9 , with a metal - poor tail extending to [ fe / h]@xmath12 . while the distribution to higher metallicities is less well determined by our observations , the comparison with lmc data indicates that it extends to [ fe / h]@xmath20.4 . by comparing the metallicities of the stars with their positions in the cmd , </S>",
    "<S> we have derived the complex age - metallicity relation of fornax . in the first few gyr </S>",
    "<S> , the metal abundance rose to [ fe / h]@xmath21.0 dex . </S>",
    "<S> the enrichment accelerated in the past @xmath3 1 - 4 gyr to reach [ fe / h]@xmath20.4 dex . </S>",
    "<S> more than half the sample is constituted of star younger than @xmath3 4 gyr , thus indicating sustained recent star formation in fornax . </S>",
    "<S> these results are briefly compared to the theoretical predictions on the evolution of dwarf galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> they indicate that the capacity of dwarf spheroidal galaxies to retain the heavy elements that they produce is larger than expected . </S>"
