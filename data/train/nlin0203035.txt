    "the level statistics of a quantum system represents the most significant , although not the only  @xcite , signature of quantum chaos .",
    "the poisson and wigner distributions of dimensionless nearest - neighbour spacing , @xmath1 , @xmath2 @xmath3 are known in quantum chaos theory as two universalities that correspond to two extreme cases of classical dynamics , namely purely regular and completely chaotic ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the majority of many - body systems such as nuclei , molecules , atoms or solids ( see  @xcite and references therein ) have been found to be chaotic although for such complex systems no classical limit can be constructed .",
    "as was first recognised by wigner  @xcite , the nearest - neighbour spacing distribution ( nnsd ) ( [ nnsw ] ) well corresponds to the eigenvalue distributions of random matrices , and this explains the importance of the random matrix theory  @xcite for studying statistical properties of many - body systems .",
    "particular attention was paid to gaussian ensembles .",
    "in fact , assuming that ( i ) the elements of the hamiltonian matrix are _ independent real variables _ and ( ii ) the matrix distribution is _ invariant _ under an _ orthogonal _ transformation of the basis states ( see , e.g. , chapter 3 in @xcite ) , one finds that the matrix elements are independent gaussian variables with zero mean and with variance satisfying the conditions @xmath4 .",
    "imposing particular symmetries on the hamiltonian , one gets  @xcite gaussian orthogonal , unitary or symplectic ensembles ( goe , gue or gse , respectively ) , which are widely and successfully applied in many fields of physics ( see e.g. reviews  @xcite ) .    up to now , excited atomic nuclei are considered to be the best examples of chaotic quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "starting from slow - neutron scattering experiments , which were first described in terms of random matrices  @xcite , a lot of nuclear structure data has been analysed in the context of chaos .",
    "however , it was repeatedly noticed that the experimental data do not exactly match the distribution ( [ nnsw ] ) and exhibit slight deviations  @xcite .",
    "these deviations are thought to be caused by the fact that the real system is not purely chaotic , but can be the quantum analog of a classical system that is transitional between chaotic and integrable . in this context , a few phenomenological formulae were proposed and analysed .",
    "the most famous are the brody  @xcite distribution , @xmath5^{\\omega+1 } \\ ; , \\ ] ] which was shown to match better the experimental data  @xcite on both high- and low - energy nuclear spectra , and the berry - robnik distribution  @xcite @xmath6 e^{-(\\pi/4)q^2 s ^2}\\}\\ ; .\\ ] ] although the brody distribution takes the form of poisson for @xmath7 and wigner for @xmath8 , it has the unrealistic property that its derivative goes to infinity at @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the parameter @xmath10 has no clear physical meaning . on the other hand",
    ", the distribution ( [ nnsbr ] ) does not give a level - repulsion for non - integrable systems .",
    "caurier et al  @xcite considered a model which allowed to simulate the transition from integrability to chaos and succeeded to derive the asymptotic limits for small and large neighbour spacings in the near - integrable limit .",
    "the idea to derive a third universality class corresponding to intermediate statistics has been actively pursued in recent years .",
    "in particular , in refs .",

    "it is referred to as the semi - poisson distribution @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we argue that one might search for an explanation of the discrepancy between data and random matrix theory simply by generalising the random matrix ensemble used .",
    "in fact , the gaussian ensemble is defined by the two assumptions ( i ) and ( ii ) mentioned above , and their applicability should be carefully checked for a given physical system . as far as nuclear physics is concerned , the deviations of the experimental data on slow - neutron or @xmath17 resonances from a random matrix description could simply arise from the _ non - invariance _ of the random matrix ensemble under an orthogonal transformation of a basis , i.e. the assumption ( ii ) is violated .",
    "in addition , it is well known that realistic interactions in many - body nuclear , molecular or atomic systems are predominantly of one- and two - body nature , implying that the distribution of the matrix is not only _ not invariant _ under an orthogonal ( unitary ) transformation of the basis , but also that the elements of the hamiltonian matrix are _ not independent _",
    "( if the number of particles is more than two ) , i.e. both assumptions for a gaussian ensemble do not hold any longer . in this context ,",
    "french and wong  @xcite and bohigas and flores  @xcite independently introduced the two - body random ensemble ( tbre ) , which is characterised by a gaussian level density distribution , rather than a semi - circle provided by a goe  @xcite .",
    "the level distributions of experimental nuclear spectra did confirm this result .",
    "the nnsd relevant for a tbre was found numerically to be fairly represented by the wigner surmise  @xcite , although recently it has been pointed out  @xcite that nnsd given by ( [ nnssp ] ) with @xmath13 and a certain real value of @xmath18 fits better the shell  model spectrum obtained with the @xmath19-interaction of wildenthal  @xcite .",
    "given the importance and actuality of these investigations , we present in this letter some analytical results concerning the properties of ( 2@xmath202 ) random symmetric matrices for which the assumption ( ii ) mentioned above is not satisfied .",
    "first , we derive the hamiltonian distribution as a function of its eigenvalues and we calculate the nnsd which _ generalises _ the well - known wigner surmise  @xcite .",
    "we show that the model allows to describe the transition from purely chaotic to asymptotically nearly integrable limits , being different from the intermediate statistics mentioned above .",
    "then , for a particular case , we give the analytical expressions for the lowest moments of this distribution .",
    "finally , we propose a method to derive the moments of the eigenvalue distribution without knowledge of an explicit expression for the distribution .",
    "let us consider a ( 2@xmath202 ) real symmetric matrix @xmath21 whose elements are independent gaussian variables with zero mean and variance @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",

    "the expression ( [ nnsgene ] ) looks like a rayleigh - rice distribution , well known in signal theory  @xcite , except for the argument of @xmath36 , which is not linear as in the usual rayleigh - rice distribution but quadratic .",
    "this is why we will refer to @xmath37 as to a _",
    "quadratic _ rayleigh - rice distribution .",

    "however , as seen from ( [ nns1])([nns2 ] ) , the natural dependence on @xmath39 provides a certain scaling .    to calculate various statistical characteristics , it is often required to know certain moments of the distribution .",
