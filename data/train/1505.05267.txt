    "in the recent years , many studies have focused on droplets hanging on horizontal fibers .",
    "such systems are very different from sessile droplets .",
    "indeed , the curvature of the substrate induces some typical phenomena such as the inhibition of film formation @xcite .",
    "this means that even if the spreading coefficient is greater than zero , droplets can be formed on fibers .",
    "moreover , the geometry of such systems has been investigated leading to the definition of two equilibrium configurations of a droplet on a fiber : the barrel and the clamshell shapes @xcite .",
    "the barrel shape is easy to characterize mathematically thanks to its symmetry @xcite .",
    "however , a numerical approach is necessary for the clamshell shape .",
    "the public domain software surface evolve ( se ) , developed by brakke @xcite , has been established for numerical simulations of various wetting problems , especially for studying the equilibrium morphologies of single droplets on cylindrical fibers @xcite .",
    "the transition between both equilibrium geometries has also been analyzed @xcite .",
    "a droplet adopts a barrel configuration when its volume is large or when the radius of the fiber is small . when the volume decreases or the radius increases , the droplet changes its shape and adopts the clamshell shape .",
    "this transition also depends on the history of the system .",
    "moreover , electrowetting has been used to change the properties of the droplets hanging from fibers and therefore to provoke the transition @xcite .",
    "the influence of gravity has also been investigated @xcite .",
    "recent works @xcite demonstrated that droplets on fibers may constitute the starting point of an open digital microfluidics , emphasizing the interest for those systems . moreover , optofluidic devices can be designed by using optical fiber networks @xcite . however , the major difficulties of such devices are the contamination and the evaporation of the droplets .",
    "this can be slowed down by the encapsulation of the core water droplets into an oil shell leading to the creation of compound droplets . from a numerical point of view",
    ", the situation becomes more complex for systems containing several components . at our knowledge",
    ", such wetting problems can not be numerically solved by the se software .",
    "therefore , in a recent work @xcite , we introduced a multiphase - field model which enables the numerical investigation of multi - droplet systems , in particular of compound droplets . in this framework",
    ", each phase refers to a droplet with specific physical properties , such as density and surface tension . the temporal evolution of each phase occurs in order to minimize the free energy of the system .",
    "the main objective of the present paper is the study of such compound droplets on fibers .",
    "horizontal fibers will be used in order to analyze such systems in their equilibrium state .",
    "this is a first step towards the elaboration of digital microfluidics devices on fibers .",
    "first , we focus on the encapsulation process and we determine the conditions under which a water droplet is encapsulated by an oil droplet .",
    "second , we show that , when a compound droplet is placed in a substrate , different contact lines are formed at the junctions between the various phases . these triple contact lines can be stable or move and fuse together . in this case",
    ", a quadruple line is formed .",
    "third , we briefly introduce the phase - field model that we use as numerical support to confirm our experimental results . in the last two sections , we focus on compound droplets on fibers .",

    "in this study , we investigate the case of compound droplets made of water and oil .",
    "we used not only pure water ( @xmath0 ) but also soapy water ( @xmath1 ) for the core droplets in order to study the influence of the surface tension .",
    "pure water is colored in blue to get stronger contrast whereas soapy water is colored in red .",
    "soapy water is a mixture of pure water and dish - washing liquid based on anionic surfactant aeos-2eo @xcite .",
    "both liquids have a density @xmath2 .",
    "the oil is a silicone oil with a viscosity of 20 cst and a density @xmath3 . for the different fluids encountered in this study ,",
    "the surface tensions were measured through pendant drop method using a cam 200 goniometer from ksv instruments ltd @xcite .",
    "each value is the average of five different experiments consisting in taking twenty pictures of a pendant drop and deducing the surface tension from the shape of the droplet .",
    "the surface tensions are found to be @xmath4 n/ m , @xmath5 = 25.7 @xmath6 0.1 n / m , @xmath7 = 18.9 @xmath6 1.4 n / m , @xmath8 = 40.1 @xmath6 1.9 n / m and @xmath9 = 4.6 @xmath6 0.1 n / m .",
    "the first step is to determine the condition under which the water is encapsulated by oil .",
    "therefore , we first consider the fluid phases only , without any substrates .",
    "droplet encapsulation is provided by the balance of the surface tensions @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig_sketch](a ) presents the contact between two non - miscible liquids in air .",
    "a contact line is formed where three surface tensions compete .",
    "the balance of these tensions defines the contact angle of the compound system .",
    "encapsulation of water by an oil shell is possible when the air - water tension ( @xmath10 ) is larger than the sum of two other tensions ( @xmath7 for the air - oil interface and @xmath8 for the oil - water interface ) .",

    "the inner contact line is the boundary between oil , water and the substrate and is characterized by a contact angle @xmath14 .",
    "the outer contact line is at the meeting of air , oil and the substrate , and defines a contact angle @xmath13 .",
    "we can compare this situation with the cases of a water and an oil sessile droplet .",
    "for a water droplet on a planar surface , there is only one contact line ( at the meeting of air , water and the surface ) characterized by a contact angle @xmath12 which differs from @xmath14 . for a sessile oil droplet",
    ", the unique contact line is characterized by the same contact angle @xmath13 as defined previously as shown in figure [ fig_sketch](c ) .",
    "the equilibrium condition for each type of contact line on a planar substrate is given by the young s equation and leads to the following system @xmath17 which can be combined in @xmath18 a similar expression can be written for the case of soapy water described in figure [ fig_sketch](d ) .    in order to predict the value of @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) ,",
    "the contact angles @xmath12 ( @xmath21 ) and @xmath13 were measured .",
    "as the contact angles only depend on the surface tensions according to the young s equation , the contact angles should be the same on a plane or on a fiber @xcite .",
    "thus , contact angles were measured when pure water , soapy water and oil droplets are hanging on nylon fibers . for each contact angle ,",
    "ten pictures were taken of droplets hanging on fibers .",
    "we found that @xmath22 for a sessile water droplet .",
    "however , it appears that for both soapy water and oil , the contact angles are smaller : @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively . by considering the values of surface tensions and contact angles ,",
    "it is possible to evaluate the right member of equation ( [ cos ] ) and then to estimate the contact angle formed by the water drop when it is covered by oil . for pure water encapsulated by oil ,",
    "the value of @xmath14 is equal to @xmath25 meaning that the water droplet forms a spherical cap with a well - defined contact angle surrounded by oil . in this case , there are two distinct contact lines : the first one is the junction of oil , water and substrate and the second one is the meeting of air , oil and substrate . whereas , for soapy water , the evaluation of the right member of equation ( [ cos ] ) leads to a value greater than 1 ( namely 1.5 ) .",
    "this means that @xmath26 is non valued . in this case , soapy water spreads inside the oil drop .",
    "the inner contact line moves towards the outer contact line .",
    "depending on the soapy water and the oil volumes , the contact lines could either never meet or merge together . in the latter case , a quadruple line could be formed .",
    "this quadruple line represents the union of four phases which are air , soapy water , oil and fiber .",
    "even if a quadruple line is formed , the observation of this phenomenon is very difficult as both soapy water and oil spread and meet the surface with small contact angles .",
    "it has to be noticed that the quadruple line formation may modify the contact angle of the oil shell .",

    "<S> although the equilibrium shapes of simple droplets on fibers are well established , the situation becomes more complex for compound fluidic systems . through experimental and numerical investigations , </S>",
    "<S> we show herein that compound droplets can be formed on fibers and that they adopt specific geometries . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the various contact lines formed at the meeting of the different phases and we study their equilibrium state . </S>",
    "<S> it appears that , depending on the surface tensions , the triple contact lines can remain separate or merge together and form quadruple lines . </S>",
    "<S> the nature of the contact lines influences the behavior of the compound droplets on fibers . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , both experimental and numerical results show that , during the detachment process , depending on whether the contact lines are triple or quadruple , the characteristic length is the inner droplet radius or the fiber radius . </S>"
