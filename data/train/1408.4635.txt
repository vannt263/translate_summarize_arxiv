    "the exact space of solutions of the equations of loop quantum gravity for vacuum , spherically symmetric space - times was recently found @xcite .",
    "the breakthrough was due to the realization that a rescaling and linear combination of the constraints of canonical quantum gravity in the spherical case yields a constraint algebra that is a lie algebra , allowing to complete the dirac quantization of the model .",
    "the space of physical states can be found in closed form .",
    "it is based on one dimensional spin networks .",
    "the proximity of the nodes of the spin networks is limited by the condition of the quantization of the areas of the spheres of symmetry .",
    "the singularity that is inside classical black holes is replaced by a region where a description in terms of a semi - classical geometry is not possible and through it one propagates into another region of space - time . here",
    "we would like to analyze the propagation of spherical null shells in the quantum black hole space - time .",
    "we will see that contrary to the behavior of quantum shells in more traditional treatments @xcite , an ingoing shell makes it through the quantum region and emerges on the other side of where the singularity used to be , via a white hole .",
    "two types of quantum effects are present when propagating through the region where the singularity used to be : 1 ) the relative fluctuations of the dirac observable that represents the metric of space - time are maximal ; 2 ) effects of the quantization of area are also maximal giving rise to large discontinuities in the value of the dirac observable that represents the metric when going from a point of the spin network to its closest neighbor .",
    "this induces random perturbations in the profile of the shells propagating through that region .",
    "we will also show that shells placed close to the horizon in a quantum state involving the superposition of ingoing and outgoing shells suffer a phenomenon analogous to hawking radiation in that one shell falls into the black hole and is trapped and the other emerges , due to fluctuations in the position of the horizon .",
    "the evolution of the system is unitary if one considers both shells but unitarity is lost if one only considers the outgoing shell .",
    "we will treat the shells as test fields to study their propagation , and then consider their back reaction on the geometry .",
    "we will approximate the evolution through effective semi - classical equations , to avoid dealing with the true equations of motion that stem from the quantum space - time , that involve coefficients that change discretely in value from one link of the spin network to the next .",
    "the approximation is good except in the region where the singularity used to be where a more careful treatment will be needed to study the propagation .",
    "we only comment on some qualitative features of the propagation in that region .",
    "to treat the spherically symmetric background quantum space time we choose variables adapted to spherical symmetry , one is left with two pairs of canonical variables @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , @xmath3 , that are related to the traditional canonical variables in spherical symmetry @xmath4 by @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the momenta canonically conjugate to @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively , @xmath12 is the radial coordinate and @xmath13 .",
    "we will take the immirzi parameter to one . after doing the rescaling and combination of the constraints discussed in @xcite",
    "the total hamiltonian becomes @xcite , @xmath14\\frac{}{}\\right ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath15 the position of the shell and @xmath16 its canonical momentum .",
    "the parameter @xmath17 is the sign of the momentum , depending on it one will have shells that are either ingoing or outgoing if one is outside the black hole .",
    "we will work perturbatively , taking the solution for the space - time of a black hole without a shell , putting a test shell on it and studying its back reaction on the geometry .",
    "we proceed to quantize the model . for the gravitational sector",
    "we consider the exact physical states found in @xcite . on those states we define an evolving constant of the motion ( a dirac observable dependent on a ( functional ) parameters ) that represents the matter hamiltonian , following a procedure outlined in @xcite .",
    "we assume the quantum states are a direct product of the gravitational states and the shell states .",
    "we take the expectation value of the shell hamiltonian with respect to the gravitational states and this provides a classical hamiltonian for matter that incorporates the corrections of the quantum space - time .",
    "we then proceed to quantize such hamiltonian using traditional quantization techniques since it is a mechanical system .",
    "we will then study the back - reaction on the quantum space - time .    to construct the evolving constant of the motion for the hamiltonian we first recall the expression of @xmath18 in terms of an evolving constant of the motion @xmath19 with @xmath20 the ( functional ) parameter and the dirac observable @xmath21 is defined by @xmath22 , with @xmath23 the number of vertices in the spin network and @xmath24 means integer part . in terms of @xmath25 ( a dirac observable ) , the matter part of the hamiltonian constraint",
    "can be written as a dirac observable itself , @xmath26 and @xmath27 can be written in terms of @xmath28 solving the hamiltonian constraint @xmath29 the hamiltonian is an evolving constant of the motion parameterized by the ( functional ) parameters @xmath20 ( present in @xmath28 ) and @xmath30 .",
    "the first one is associated with spatial diffeomorphisms and the latter with the slicing of space - time chosen .",
    "one can now evaluate the expectation value of the hamiltonian of the shell on the exact physical states of the gravitational theory . at this point",
    "it is good to choose the parameter @xmath30 of the shell hamiltonian by fixing @xmath30 to be a ( negative ) function of @xmath12 that vanishes outside the black hole ( starting with the first point of the spin network outside where the classical event horizon would have been ) and is non - vanishing inside , its absolute value taking a maximum value where the singularity used to be and then diminishing as one goes past it and eventually becomes zero just outside the cauchy horizon inside the black hole .",
    "these types of slicings are penetrating slicings akin to eddington  finkelstein coordinates and will allow us to follow the evolution of shells as they penetrate inside the black hole .",
    "we will choose the states of the gravitational variables judiciously so they approximate well a classical space - time in regions far away from where the classical singularity used to be .",
    "this requires superpositions of states @xmath31 such that the values of @xmath32 vary monotonously and without significant jumps between adjacent values ( the values of @xmath32 determine the radial coordinate up to a planck scale ) and that the spread in the values of @xmath33 is small compared to its value . the minimum separation in radial coordinate in these states",
    "is given by @xmath34 with @xmath15 the radial coordinate such that @xmath35 is the area of the surfaces of symmetry .",
    "in this idealized context , where one has an eternal black hole and no true dynamics , it could also be possible to choose a state that approximates a semi - classical geometry in the region of high curvature .",
    "it will have large discontinuities in the relative values of the metric components in that region , but well defined values .",
    "however , such a choice appears artificial .",
    "instead we choose states that are superpositions and given the large ( and different ) discontinuities in the region of high curvature for each of the component states one does not have a semi - classical geometry well approximated there .",
    "taking the expectation value of the shell hamiltonian on the exact physical states of vacuum gravity essentially determines the prefactor of @xmath16 in ( [ 4 ] ) entirely as a function @xmath36 determined by @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "from the quantum corrected matter hamiltonian one can work out the equations of motion for the shell .",
    "for that it will be convenient to specify the parameters in the parameterized dirac observables representing @xmath2 and @xmath0 . we have already chosen @xmath30 .",
    "we now choose a spin network such that the eigenvalues of @xmath28 are approximated very well by @xmath40 , therefore determining the ( functional ) parameter @xmath20 .",
    "the condition on @xmath2 implies @xmath41 and the diffeomorphism constraint can be solved for @xmath3 .",
    "the condition on @xmath30 implies that @xmath42 , so the lapse is a constant we call @xmath43 .",
    "this allows to solve the hamiltonian constraint for @xmath0 and therefore the metric . taking the poisson bracket of @xmath15 and @xmath16 with the hamiltonian we get , @xmath44 from which it follows that @xmath45 is a constant and is the contribution of the shell to the hamiltonian constraint up to a dirac delta function .",
    "this allows to combine it with the other terms in the constraint and what one has is that the @xmath46 term in the hamiltonian gets modified by a constant @xmath45 , times a heaviside function @xmath47 , i.e. the energy of the shell contributes to the mass of the spacetime outside of the shell .",
    "this is the back - reaction of the shell on the space - time .",
    "notice that the variables @xmath48 are continuous , but the coefficients of the equations of motion ( [ 3],[4 ] ) will change discretely as one traverses from one link of the spin network to the next through the evolution of the shell . in this paper",
    "we will not take this into account and treat the equations as a semi - classical approximation with the coefficients determined by a continuous metric , as we are choosing a quantum state in which the jumps in the values of variables from a link of the spin network to the next are small .",
    "we will discuss separately what happens in the region where the singularity used to be , where this approximation does not hold .",
    "depending on the sign of @xmath39 the analysis changes .",
    "we start with @xmath49 which corresponds an infalling shell from outside the black hole passing through the planckian region inside and emerging in the white hole .",
    "one can study @xmath36 numerically with choices for @xmath37 and @xmath30 as the ones we discussed that allow to cover the entire space - time .",
    "it turns out that it can be modeled by a function @xmath50 with @xmath51 a macroscopic quantity much smaller than the mean value of the schwarzschild radius , since the exact @xmath52 is very small at the horizon , and @xmath53 is small , of the order of planck length .",
    "notice that @xmath15 now spans from @xmath54 at @xmath55 all the way to @xmath56 with @xmath57 the point where the singularity used to be in the classical solution .",
    "we define a self - adjoint operator associated with the shell s hamiltonian and determine its spectrum , @xmath58 with @xmath59 its eigenvalue , which is positive as it is the correction of the mass due to the presence of the shell .",
    "its eigenstates can be found @xmath60 .",
    "the integral can be computed in closed form for the simple form of @xmath52 we introduced above , @xmath61 .",
    "these states are orthonormal @xmath62 and they satisfy a closure relation , showing that the hamiltonian is indeed self - adjoint .",
    "superposing such states with a gaussian weight in @xmath59 , one obtains a time dependent wavefunction for the propagation of the shell , with a unitary evolution , as the one shown in fig . 1 ,    [ fig1 ] ) , in an approximation where we consider a semi - classical geometry everywhere .",
    "the amplitude diminishes , but is non - vanishing in the planckian region around @xmath63 for all values of @xmath64 .",
    "the portion at the left is the shell incoming into the black hole and the portion at the right the shell exiting through the whitehole .",
    "the behavior is completely symmetric around @xmath63 as the effective model considered does not incorporate the fluctuations at the planckian region.,title=\"fig:\",height=283 ]    notice that the incoming shell traverses the planck region and will eventually emerge into the new asymptotically flat region that the eternal non - singular black hole solution in loop quantum gravity has after traversing a white hole .",
    "the eternal non - singular solution is symmetric around @xmath63 and the horizon of the black hole is mirrored in @xmath65 by a white hole .",
    "as we will see , when one considers a more realistic evolution through the planck region , although the space - time is symmetric around @xmath63 the evolution of the pulse will not be due to quantum fluctuations .",
    "we also wish to consider the case of a shell with outgoing momentum ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "the resulting shell would be outgoing in its motion ( @xmath67 ) if it is in the black hole exterior , but would still be ingoing in its motion , as expected , in the black hole interior . in this case",
    "we do not have a simple expression approximating the behavior of @xmath52 as before , but its behavior can be studied numerically .",
    "one now has that @xmath52 vanishes at the horizon .",
    "that means that the zero of energies for the shells is placed at the horizon .",
    "shells with outgoing momentum inside the horizon will have negative energy and shells outside have positive energies @xcite .",
    "this can be easily seen in eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) : @xmath68 everywhere , in this case @xmath69 and @xmath70 outside so one has the first term multiplied times @xmath66 and the energy is positive . at the horizon",
    "one can check using the definition of @xmath0 that the two terms in ( [ 4 ] ) cancel each other . from there inward , their difference is negative as the modulus of @xmath30 grows",
    ". shells with outgoing momentum inside the horizon behave like positive energy shells moving into the past .",
    "[ fig1 ]    notice that the foliation we are using , which behaves like schwarzschild coordinates outside the black hole with @xmath70 and behaves like eddington  finkelstein coordinates in the interior labels the hypersurfaces with the time of an observer at infinity . as such , the foliation can not go beyond the cauchy horizon in the interior of the black hole and the evolution of the shells seems to `` stop '' there .",
    "[ fig3 ]    [ fig3 ]      up to now we have made a treatment in terms of a semi - classical metric even in the planckian region .",
    "although states that approximate a semi - classical geometry everywhere do exist in our highly idealized description of an ever existing black hole , they are likely not the ones that occur in nature after gravitational collapse .",
    "more likely is that one will have superpositions of gravitational states and that implies that in the planckian regions there will be large fluctuations , for instance , in the curvature . to try to mimic the effect of these fluctuations in the evolution of shells ,",
    "we have studied the evolution of the same shell in two different quantum states of the gravitational that could enter in such superpositions and then superposed the evolutions .",
    "the results are shown in figure 3 .",
    "one has interesting consequences when one considers superpositions of shells near the horizon .",
    "consider outgoing shells .",
    "the ones that lie outside the horizon will make it to scri+ .",
    "the ones inside the horizon , in spite of being `` outgoing '' end up traveling through the planckian region inside the black hole .",
    "now , in a quantum space - time one expects fluctuations in the position of the horizon .",
    "the horizon carries out a random walk . after some time the fluctuations accumulate , and",
    "by page time could imply deviations in the radial coordinate position of the horizon of the order of planck length @xcite .",
    "a related discussion of fluctuations can be found in @xcite .",
    "that sounds small , but due to the high blueshifts at the horizons , it implies very different evolutions for shells outside the horizon depending on where they lie with respect to the horizon .",
    "therefore if one considers a shell of finite width obtained by superposing shells like the ones we consider in this paper , the various components will evolve in very different ways .",
    "this suggests a mechanism for the quantum space - time to produce appreciable effects in a region where one would have ordinarily not expected significant corrections due to quantum gravity .",
    "note that although one would have expected a semi - classical metric at the horizon would describe well the situation , given that it is a region of low curvature , it is the fluctuations that give rise to the effect .",
    "this could be a potential source of breakdown of complementarity .",
    "the fluctuations of the horizon might also imply that some of the shells in a superposition end up being inside the horizon and will therefore end up in the planckian region even if they were outgoing shells ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "this is similar to what happens in the pair production process of hawking radiation .",
    "notice that the shell inside the horizon contributes negatively to the mass of the black hole , as is commonly argued in the heuristic picture of hawking radiation .",
    "the evolution of the complete wavepacket of shells is unitary provided one keeps track of the shells inside the black hole .",
    "looking at the evolution of the outside ones only , unitarity would appear lost .",
    "it is worthwhile comparing our results with those obtained with more traditional quantizations of shells .",
    "most efforts have concentrated on self - gravitating shells so the parallels are not easy to draw . however , in those proposals shells `` bounce '' and behaviors like a superposition of white and black holes emerged leading to the concept of `` grey holes '' @xcite .",
    "none of these behaviors are observed here , largely in part due to the elimination of the singularity in loop quantum gravity .",
    "there have been studies of shells propagating on black holes but have not addressed in detail what happens at the singularity @xcite .",
    "the fact that the shells emerge through a white hole may suggest that this is a way in which information could leak from an evaporating black hole , although our eternal black hole exact solution does not allow us to model that situation in detail . a conjectural scenario based on this observation",
    "is presented in @xcite .",
