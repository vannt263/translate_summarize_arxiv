    "the emergence of new social systems and organizational social applications has created a number of novel social and ubiquitous environments . by interacting with such systems , the user is leaving traces within the different databases and log files , e.g.,by updating the user s status via twitter , commenting an image in flickr , copying a post in bibsonomy , or connecting to other users via ubiquitous devices .",
    "ultimately , each type of such a trace gives rise to a corresponding network of user relatedness , where users are connected if they interacted either explicitly ( e.g.,by a direct encounter via an rfid tag , or by establishing `` friendship '' in an online social network ) or implicitly ( e.g.,by visiting a user s profile page ) .",
    "we consider a link within such a network as evidence for user relatedness and interaction and call it accordingly _ social interaction network_. this connects but also transcends private and business applications featuring a range of different types of networks , organizational contexts and corresponding interactions , e.g.,networks that involve spatial proximity relations like co - location or face - to - face proximity . in this context , physical devices , e.g.,mobile phones or rfid devices ,",
    "can help to link relations in the digital domain to relations in physical and/or social space , and vice - versa . with the growth and availability of the collected data ,",
    "there is also an increasing interest in the analysis of such social interaction networks .",
    "this articleconsiders data mining in social interaction networks , specifically human behavioral ( offline ) networks , that is , networks of face - to - face proximity , e.g.,during a conversation .",
    "we call these networks _ face - to - face contact networks _ in the following .",
    "we include social ( online ) networks contructed from subject - centric or object - centric sociality  @xcite , considering data from social bookmarking systems such as bibsonomy  @xcite and resource sharing systems like flickr , but especially focus on real - world face - to - face contact networks .",
    "the capture of human face - to - face contacts in social interaction networks and the analysis of both offline and online data is receiving increasing interest . while there has been foundational work on the analysis of face - to - face contact networks , e.g. ,  @xcite , data mining on those networks is still a rather new field of research , for which we provide novel analyses resulting in new insights into their structure and relations .",
    "in addition , we adapt , extend and apply known data mining methods to the collected social interaction networks , especially the face - to - face contact networks .",
    "furthermore , we propose novel methods and approaches for describing and characterizing the networks and properties of their nodes , respectively .",
    "integrated into different systems  @xcite and applications  @xcite , the techniques and methods are also deployed in a practical real - world setting .",
    "this work , an adapted and substantially extended revision of  @xcite , provides an overview on those previously published articles  @xcite as grouped together in the author s habilitation thesis  @xcite .    the face - to - face contact networks in our context",
    "are acquired using the conferator  @xcite and mygroup  @xcite systems .",
    "conferator , a social conference guidance system , and mygroup , a social workgroup support system , are ubiquitous social systems for enhancing social interactions in the context of conferences and working groups , respectively .",
    "they are built on top of the rfid - based proximity sensing hardware developed by the sociopatterns collaboration , and on top of the ubiconsoftware platform  @xcite .",
    "both systems allow the collection of real - world networks of human face - to - face interactions  as behavioral networks  as well as the utilization of additional online social networks .",
    "since these are our own systems , we were able to comprehensively perform our experiments using all the available data .",
    "data mining provides approaches for the identification and discovery of non - trivial patterns and models hidden in large collections of data  @xcite .",
    "while there exist several process models for data mining  @xcite , a prominent model is given by the crisp - dm process  @xcite  an industry standard for data mining .",
    "crisp - dm consists of six phases :    _ business understanding _    _",
    "data understanding _    _ data preparation _    _ modeling _",
    "_ evaluation _ , and    _",
    "deployment_.    we combine data mining and social network analysis techniques for analyzing social interaction networks in order to improve our _ understanding _ of the data , the modeled behavior , and its underlying processes , in section  [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "this corresponds to the business and data understanding phases in the crisp - dm process .",
    "furthermore , for the analysis itself we can also apply techniques for explorative analysis discussed below .",
    "next , we focus on elements of the _ modeling _ phase , i.  e.,the core data mining step in sections  [ sec : predictive]-[sec : descriptive ] : the applied data mining methods can be divided into descriptive and predictive methods  @xcite : while descriptive methods are used for summarizing the data , for identifying hidden information in the form of patterns , and for exploration , predictive methods are used for constructing models for inferring future properties given new data , e.g.,for classification : we adapt and extend known predictive data mining algorithms on social interaction networks for supporting the users in typical tasks such as recommendation and localization in the context of the mentioned systems",
    ". additionally , we present novel methods for descriptive data mining for uncovering and extracting relations and patterns for hypothesis generation and exploration by the user , in order to provide characteristic information about the data and networks .",
    "the methods and criteria in the _ evaluation _ phase depend on the applied model type , and are therefore specific for a data mining technique . therefore , we discuss these in the respective subsections of sections  [ sec : predictive]-[sec : descriptive ] .",
    "in addition , section  [ sec : analysis : structural ] describes a novel community assessment technique , while section  [ sec : descriptive : exploratory ] summarizes interactive techniques for the evaluation of mined patterns in social interaction networks . finally ,",
    "the _ deployment _ phase is tackled by the integration of the methods into practical applications , e.g.,into conferatorand mygroupas described in section  [ sec : basics : conferator ] .",
    "furthermore , especially the descriptive data mining methods have been integrated into the pattern mining and analytics system vikamine  @xcite .",
    "overall , data mining in the context of social interaction networks concerns core elements of data mining and knowledge discovery itself , e.g. ,  @xcite , but also includes techniques from social network analysis , e.g. ,  @xcite , as well as mining social media , e.g. ,  @xcite , complex network analytics  @xcite , and mining the ubiquitous web  @xcite .    specifically , community detection  @xcite , analysis of roles  @xcite , contact patterns  @xcite , localization  @xcite , recommendations  @xcite , link prediction  @xcite , descriptive pattern mining  @xcite , exceptional model mining  @xcite , but also techniques for reality mining , e.g. ,  @xcite are prominent topics in this area . especially for face - to - face contact networks , cattuto et colleagues  @xcite",

    ", we will discuss related work in the respective sections in more detail .",
    "the remainder of this workis structured as follows : section  [ sec : basics ] outlines basics of social interaction networks , real - world face - to - face contact networks , and describes the conferatorand mygroupsystems .",
    "section  [ sec : analysis ] summarizes several analysis directions concerning interrelations in social interaction networks , communities and roles in human face - to - face contact networks , and structure and dynamics of interactions of conference participants .",
    "next , section  [ sec : predictive ] discusses adaptations , extensions , and applications of predictive methods in social interaction networks .",
    "after that , section  [ sec : descriptive ] presents novel efficient descriptive methods for community mining and exceptional model mining , as well as an exploratory pattern mining approach on social interaction networks .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conclusions ] concludes with a summary and outlook .",
    "in this section , we focus on basics of social interaction networks . we first provide an introduction to social interaction networks .",
    "next , we focus on human face - to - face contact networks . after that , we present the conferatorand mygroupsystems .      with the rise of social software and social media , a wealth of user - generated data and user interactions is being created in online social networks  @xcite  as a technical platform . often , these are also called ( online ) social network services , cf .  @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we adopt an intuitive definition of social media , regarding it as online systems and services in the ubiquitous web , which create and provide social data generated by human interaction and communication  @xcite .",
    "a _ social network _ is a core concept of social network analysis  @xcite : according to wassermann and faust  @xcite , a social network is a social structure consisting of a set of actors ( such as individuals or organizations ) and a set of dyadic ties between these actors",
    ". there are various types of ties such as , for example , friendship , kinship , or organizational position . usually , these relations are modeled as a graph , with the actors as nodes , and the ties as edges connecting the nodes .    in this article",
    ", we focus on _ social interaction networks _",
    "@xcite , i.  e.,user - related social networks in social media capturing social relations inherent in social interactions , social activities and other social phenomena which act as proxies for social user - relatedness . therefore",
    ", according to the categorization of wassermann and faust  ( * ? ? ?",
    "social interaction networks focus on _ interaction _ relations between _ people _ as the corresponding actors .",
    "this also includes interaction data from sensors and mobile devices , as long as the data is created by real users .",
    "consider , for example , users who connect their mobile phones via bluetooth or nfc ( near field communication ) , look at similar pictures in flickr , talk about similar topics in twitter , or explicitly establish `` contacts '' within certain applications .",
    "furthermore , we consider real - world contacts as determined by other ubiquitous applications , based on principles of ubiquitous computing  @xcite or the ubiquitous web  @xcite .",
    "networks in ubiquitous and social applications , for example , in rfid - based systems , can be derived according to the detected contacts between the respective rfid tags : a tie between two actors can be derived , for example , if their assigned rfid tags were in contact , possibly weighted with the number of contacts , or their durations .",
    "such social interation networks are often observed during certain events , for example , during conferences  @xcite , at work  @xcite , or other group - based activities . in section  [ sec : basics : f2f ] , we specifically discuss human face - to - face contact networks .",
    "furthermore , we summarize according applications in section  [ sec : basics : conferator ] .",
    "overall , we consider social interactions in an online and offline context , that is , connections and relations in online systems as well as real - world face - to - face contacts .",
    "furthermore , we also consider social relations implemented using specific resources or artifacts , according to the principle of object - centric sociality  @xcite , where objects of a specific actor , e.g.,resources , mediate connections to other actors .",
    "this is especially relevant in the scope of social bookmarking and social resource sharing systems .",
    "examples are given by the `` favorite '' relation in flickr  @xcite , or resource - resource relations , e.g.,by a common set of tagged images .",
    "this also transcends to further collaborative systems , for example , data of versioning systems like cvs  @xcite .",
    "typical analytical questions concern the analysis of key actors , roles and communities , ranging from different measures of centrality , cf .",
    "@xcite to the exploration of topological graph properties , e.g. ,  @xcite or structural neighborhood similarities , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of communities intuitively considers densely connected subgroups of actors , represented as nodes in the social network , e.g. ,  @xcite . the detection and characterization of communities is a typical descriptive data mining task  @xcite , as well as the description of patterns given properties of the nodes , e.g.,roles , tagging information , or common geo - location .",
    "predictive approaches include , for example , link prediction techniques , as well as recommendation , or utilizing the network for improving localization methods .",
    "both descriptive methods and predictive modeling approaches will be discussed in sections  [ sec : predictive ] and  [ sec : descriptive ] , respectively , below .",
    "r0.45     in contrast to online interactions , face - to - face contacts represent interactions between actors in the real - world .",
    "consider conference contact networks , for example : using the sociopatterns rfid tags and the conferatorsystem described below , face - to - face contacts can be measured . when the rfid tags are worn on the chest of the conference participants ,",
    "tag - to - tag proximity is a proxy for face - to - face communication , since the range of the signals is approximately 1.5 meters if not blocked by the human body . for detecting a contact",
    ", we apply the technique described in  @xcite , which is based on a typical conversational setting : a face - to - face contact is observed when the duration of the contact is at least 20 seconds .",
    "a contact ends when the two corresponding proximity tags do not detect each other for more than 60 seconds .",
    "face - to - face contact networks are a special sort of social interaction networks . using face - to - face contacts between pairs of actors",
    ", we can derive a face - to - face contact networks .",
    "the networks are constructed such that links connect actors , if these were in face - to - face contact , possible weighted with the contact count or the ( normalized ) contact duraction .",
    "other networks that indicate real - world interactions , e.g.,by co - authorship or frequent co - location , are obtained by considering co - visited talks , posters , or co - authored papers .",
    "networks based on co - location can be constructed , for example , based on the counts or ( normalized ) durations that pairs of participants were observed in the same location , for example , at room - level",
    ". figure  [ fig : contactlengthdistribution ] shows an example of the typical contact distribution that we observe in conference face - to - face contact networks : confirming previous findings , e.g.,by the sociopatterns collaboration  @xcite , most of the contacts take less than one minute and the contact durations of both conferences show a long - tailed distribution .",
    "in contrast to the work presented by the sociopatterns collaboration discussed above , we aim at a larger research focus concerning data mining and social network analysis : we examine social dynamics in conferences and the contexts of working groups . additionally , we especially investigate communities , and roles of actors in these networks grounded using background information .",
    "furthermore , we do not primarily approach the _ modeling _ of the networks phenomena from a social network analysis perspective , but focus on the analysis , and especially on approaches and methods for mining and extracting useful models and patterns from the data .",
    "conferator  @xcite and mygroup  @xcite are ubiquitous social systems for enhancing social interactions : conferatoris a social conference guidance system for efficiently managing face - to - face contacts at a conference , and collectively building a personalized conference program .",
    "mygroupis a similar system in the context of working groups that aims to enhance interactions and knowledge exchange between the individual team members .",
    "both systems are built on top of the rfid - based proximity sensing system developed by the sociopatterns collaboration .",
    "the applied rfid tags allow the coupling of real world ( offline ) data , i.  e.,face - to - face contacts , with the online social world , e.g.,given by online interactions within the system or in linked online social networks .",
    "in particular , these rfid proximity tags can collect face - to - face contacts .",
    "this allows for highly personalized profiles in the systems which can be applied , e.g.,for community mining , recommendations , or for improving the localization .    in the following ,",
    "we first give an overview on the systems and the applied technical platform ubicon .",
    "after that , we summarize the most important features of the systems .",
    "conferator  @xcite is a social and ubiquitous conference guidance system , aiming at supporting conference participants during conference planning , attendance and their post - conference activities .",
    "it features the ability to observe and to manage social and face - to - face contacts during the conference and provides a number of features for supporting social networking .    in a similar context",
    ", the conference navigator by brusilovsky  @xcite allows attendees of a conference to organize the conference schedule .",
    "however , it is not connected to the real live activity of the user during the conference .",
    "hui et al .",
    "@xcite describe an application using bluetooth - based modules for collecting mobility patterns of conference participants . furthermore , eagle and pentland  @xcite present an approach for collecting proximity and location information using bluetooth - enabled mobile phones , and analyze the obtained networks .",
    "similarly , the find - and - connect  @xcite system utilizes bluetooth and passive rfid for obtaining locations of participants , and infers _ encounters _ based on the co - location of participants as a proxy for contacts between participants .",
    "however , no direct face - to - face contacts are measured .",
    "in contrast to these systems , conferatoris able to collect the real - world face - to - face contacts using the sociopattern rfid tags described above .",
    "the setup requires a number of rfid readers at fixed positions in the target area ; the participants are then equipped with rfid tags .",
    "the technology allows for the localization of tags and for detecting tag - to - tag proximity .",
    "when the tags are worn on the chest , tag - to - tag proximity is a proxy for a face - to - face contact , since the range of the signals is approximately 1.5 meters if not blocked by the human body . for more details , we refer to barrat et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "utilizing rfid proximity tags , social interaction data can be collected at a much more accurate level than , e.g.,based on co - location information  @xcite . from the data",
    ", we can derive social interaction networks , apply these for mining the collected data , and put the discovered patterns and learned models to use by the system . with conferator",
    ", we provide a broad application spectrum and features : compared to previous rfid - based approaches , we increased the precision of the localization component and linked together tag information and the conference schedule",
    ". furthermore , we implemented a light - weight integration with bibsonomy , and added connectors to other social systems used by participants , e.g.,facebook , twitter , xing or linkedin .",
    "this provides the basis for new insights into the behavior of all participants concerning their real - world ( offline ) and online social interactions .",
    "conferatorhas been successfully applied at lwa 2010  @xcite , lwa 2011 , and lwa 2012  conferences for special interest groups of the german computer science society ( gi ) , at the hypertext 2011 conference  @xcite , and at a technology day of the venus project .",
    "mygroupaims at supporting members of working groups .",
    "it employs the same technology as conferatorfor localizing the members and for monitoring their social contacts .",
    "additionally it provides profile information including links to ( external ) social software , e.g.,bibsonomy  @xcite , twitter , facebook , or xing .",

    "in addition , mygrouphas also been utilized at a large student party , for supporting organizational processes , at the first international changemaker - camp at the university of kassel for profiling group processes , and at a codecamp for supporting software development in the context of the venus project .",
    "conferatorand mygrouphave been implemented using the ubiconplatform  a platform for enhancing ubiquitous and social networking . from a technical point of view",
    ", the ubiconplatform consists of the application logic , components for privacy management and database management , a ( customizable ) set of data processors that process the incoming ( raw ) data , a set of data processors for more subsequent sophisticated processing , and a storage architecture based on a mysql database .",

    "ubiconcan be deployed using a standard servlet container , e.g.,apache tomcat .",
    "conferatorand mygroupenable ubiquitous social networking using profile information , data from social contacts , as well as from monitoring the current activity streams , e.g.,ongoing contacts , visits of talks , bibsonomyposts , twittertweets , etc . from a data mining perspective",
    ", we can the collected social structures provided by both social networks and social resource sharing systems for supporting complex and structured interactions : we can recommend persons , for example , based on joint research topics or contacts .",
    "we apply data mining methods on the collected data to make this information visible to our users .",
    "different trust and privacy settings , e.g.,concerning the visibility of contacts and locations , allow a selective distribution of sensitive information which is important for increasing trust in the system  @xcite .",
    "conference participants can recall their individual contacts , e.g.,as virtual business cards , cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : peerradar ] .",
    "the system allows the setup of a complete profile , social networking to other participants , and the management and personalization of the conference schedule , by providing helpful information about the individual talks , upcoming talks , and the ability to pick talks for a personal conference program .",
    "in addition , recommendations for contacting _ interesting _ persons are provided .",
    "conferatorand mygroupfeature the following basic options : they allow participants to recall their contacts ( in the _ contact view _ , depicting the shares of contacts to other users ) , to observe the ( online ) social live around them ( _ timeline view _ , as a configurable list of time - based events and activities ) , to help in finding participants via the localization component ( _ map view _ , see figure  [ fig : locations ] ) and to browse the individual profiles ( _ profile view _ , see figure  [ fig : peerradar ] ) .",

    "it is an aggregation of different events and activities of the participants arranged in a time - oriented list .",
    "this includes , for example , contacts , bibsonomyposts or twittertweets : it provides an aggregated view on the currently active topics published on twitteror bibsonomy by the participants and the conversations that recently happened .",
    "mygrouputilizes the same visualization technique : the timeline , for example , which is displayed on a large lcd screen at the kde group at the university of kassel , often stimulates interesting research discussions and enables enhanced dissemination and exchange of knowledge .",
    "the systems are continuously refined according to user feedback and usability studies , leading to continuous improvement of the systems and implementation of new useful features .    altogether , conferatorand mygroupcreate a ubiquitous and social environment where large groups ( implicitly ) collaborate together using electronic media to accomplish certain tasks .",
    "ultimately , this enables a form of _ collective intelligence _",
    "@xcite : a very intuitive notion captures the term as `` groups of individuals doing things collectively that seem intelligent ''  @xcite . in the context of conferences and working groups , for example , talk and contact recommendations can be improved using the collected interaction data .",

    "social interaction networks are of large interest for major applications , such as recommending contacts in online social networks or for identifying groups of related users , cf",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "there , we provide a detailed structure and semantic based analysis of three sample social media applications : twitter(microblogging ) , flickr(social resource sharing ) , and bibsonomy(social bookmarking ) . in each application , we identify various implicit and explicit social interaction networks , also called evidence networks , focusing on explicit and implicit user traces .    in the following ,",
    "we outline two main issues : are there interrelations and correlations between the interaction networks ?",
    "furthermore , can these be applied for the analysis and data - driven assessment of communities ?",
    "the second question is especially important , since one of the main problems of community detection  @xcite is the non - trivial evaluation and validation of the identified communities .",
    "the assessment of the quality of a given community is always application dependent and _ relative _ to certain aspects of user relatedness , e.g.,race of individuals in @xcite , shared topical interests in social bookmarking systems , or social traces manifested in the social interaction networks .",
    "often there is no gold - standard evaluation data at hand in order to validate the discovered groups .      as a starting point for the analysis of the considered social interaction networks , we perform a structural interrelation analysis in order to identify general properties and to compare different networks focusing on common network structures , community structures , and user - relations within these networks .",
    "we examine and compare social interaction networks applying user data from the real - world social bookmarking application bibsonomy , flickrand twitter .",
    "we analyze general structural properties of the obtained networks and comparatively discuss major structural characteristics in order to show that there are structural and semantic inter - network correlations between the different evidence networks .",
    "in particular , we examine several general structural properties , the degree distribution and the degree correlation , indicating significant similarities of the networks .",
    "furthermore , we analyze topological and semantical distances , the dependencies of the networks neighborhood , and the inter - network correlations , and collect evidences for strong correlations and interrelations between the considered social interaction networks .",
    "specifically , we analyze inter - network correlations between such user - generated networks and show that these relations are strong enough for inferring reciprocal conclusions between the networks .",
    "the social interaction networks are thoroughly analyzed with respect to the contained community structure . using standard community measures , e.g.,modularity  @xcite , segregation index  @xcite , and conductance  @xcite ,",
    "we show that there is a strong common community structure accross different social interaction networks .",
    "furthermore , we analyze the rankings between a large set of communities mined on the different networks , and show , that the induced rankings are reciprocally consistent . therefore , since the correlations and dependencies are strong enough for assessing structural analysis techniques , e.g.,community mining methods , implicitly acquired social interaction networks can be applied for a broad range of analysis methods instead of using expensive gold - standard information .",
    "we therefore propose an approach for ( relative ) community assessment : the presented approach is based on the idea of _ reconstructing existing social structures _",
    "@xcite for the assessment and evaluation of a given clustering .",
    "this provides for a simple yet cost - efficient assessment option , since we can apply secondary data , i.  e.,implicitly acquired social interaction networks capturing user relatedness , for assessing community structures for another network in the same application context .",
    "specifically , the presented analysis is thus not only relevant for the evaluation of community mining techniques , but also for implementing new community detection or user recommendation algorithms , among others .      gaining a better understanding of communities and roles in social interaction networks helps for a number of applications , for example , for personalization , community detection , or recommendations .    in  @xcite",
    ", we investigate user - interaction and community structure according to different special interest groups during a conference . for the analysis , we considered the contact network of the lwa 2010 conference that we obtained using the conferatorsystem .",
    "the analysis thus utilizes real - world conference data capturing community information about participants and their face - to - face contacts , and is grounded using information about membership in special interest groups and academic status / position .",
    "we analyze various general structural properties of the contact graph , confirming previous results of the sociopattern experiments concerning typical face - to - face contact networks at conferences e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we examine different explicit and implicit roles of conference participants in the context of community structure at the conference .",
    "role mining concerning communities mainly analyzes the relations between the communities for a specific actor .",
    "scripps et al  @xcite present a method for assessing roles with respect to the membership in the communities and the potential to bridge or to connect different communities . in this way",
    ", different actor profiles concerning their centrality prestige and their community importance can be derived .",
    "chou and suzuki present a similar method considering a set of given communities  @xcite for such a community - oriented analysis .      for analyzing the community structure and its dynamics , we consider community detection methods in a time - based analysis using the special interest group communities as a ground truth .",
    "we analyze , whether there is a detectable community structure in the investigated face - to - face networks that is consistent with the one given through the groups . using the community measure _ segregation index _",
    "@xcite and modularity  @xcite , for example , we can observe the trend , that more relevant ( i.  e.,longer ) conversations are biased towards dialog partners with common interests , as captured by the interest group membership : members of a special interest group tend to talk more frequently and longer within their interest group , as analyzed on the accordingly weighted social interaction networks .",
    "furthermore , with increasing minimal conversation lengths the induced social interaction networks show a more pronounced community structure , both considering automatically mined communities as well as the communities defined by the special interest groups .",
    "this finding is also supported by analyzing the densities in the respective subgraphs induced by the community detection method , and the respective ground - truth communities .",
    "therefore , the face - to - face contacts show inherent community structure , which is also consistent with the special interest groups .      for analyzing the dynamics of roles of the participants ,",
    "we also utilize the ground - truth community information .",
    "we provide a time - based analysis of the roles , and different role profiles .",
    "for example , we consider _ bridges _ connecting communities , or _ ambassadors _ as important bridging actors . as an example",

    "in contrast to intuition , in the analysis of the presenters , we can not confirm our assumption , that these were more involved in talks with participants presenting similar work based on the content of their papers .",

    "this enables the capture of conceptual knowledge which is mostly propagated via conversations and can not be extracted by mining software repositories .",
    "in addition to weighted edges which reflect the relative amount of changed lines of code , we consider edges between the developers .",

    "we evaluated the approach in the context of a developer group with a medium sized project comparing the proposed approach against a ground - truth expert - ranking .",

    "as depicted in figure  [ fig : lwa2010-impactcontactlength ] , we observe , for example , that a longer contact , i.  e.,a conversation , is more likely , the longer the contact on the first day of the conference .",

    "overall , the results of the analysis provides interesting insights especially concerning the impact of the contact durations and the strength of such stronger ties .",
    "these insights are a first step onto predictability applications for human contact networks .",

    "descriptive data mining aims to uncover certain patterns for characterization and description of the data . typically , the goal of the methods is not only an actionable model , but also a human interpretable set of patterns  @xcite .",
    "descriptive pattern mining especially supports the goal of explanation - aware data mining  @xcite , due to its more interpretable results , e.g.,for characterizing a set of data  @xcite , for concept description  @xcite , and for providing regularities and associations between elements in general .    in the following , we present novel methods for descriptive data mining for uncovering and extracting relations and patterns .",
    "these are applied for hypothesis generation and exploration by the user , in order to provide characteristic information about the data and networks .",
    "we focus on the mining of patterns that describe interesting communities and subsets of nodes contained in social interaction networks .",
    "we first describe an efficient method for descriptive community mining based on the novel comodoalgorithm  @xcite : descriptive community mining aims to identify interesting communities according to a community evaluation function using the network structure , and a set of descriptive attributes .",
    "next , we discuss a generalized setting for identifying descriptive patterns utilizing exceptional model mining  @xcite , and provide the gp - growthalgorithm  @xcite for fast exhaustive exceptional model mining : it can then be applied both for characterizing the network structure using an approach similar to descriptive community mining , but also for describing interesting subgroups of nodes in the network based on their properties .",
    "after that , an exploratory approach  @xcite on social interaction networks using geo - tagged social media is presented , which utilizes both techniques presented above .",
    "all approaches can be applied for supporting the user , e.g.,for recommendations , facetted browsing , or for interactive exploration .",
    "community mining is a prominent approach for identifying densely connected subgroups of the nodes contained in a network .",
    "a community is intuitively defined as a set of nodes that has more and/or better links between its members compared to the rest of the network .",
    "classic community mining , e.g. ,  @xcite , works on a set of nodes connected by links . in general ,",
    "usually not only the density within the community is assessed but the connection density of the community is compared to the density of the rest of the network  @xcite , e.g.,using the modularity  @xcite , the segregation index  @xcite or the conductance  @xcite as an evaluation function .",
    "then , cuts between communities are established in such a way as to maximize the community evaluation function the core idea of the evaluation function is to apply an objective evaluation criterion , for example , for the modularity the number of connections within the community compared to the statistically `` expected '' number based on all available connections in the network , and to prefer those communities that optimize the evaluation function .",
    "usually , an optimization approach is taken that partitions the whole graph subsequently into a number of parts  each of them is then considered as a community .",
    "the discovered communities can then be applied , for example , for recommendations or for personalization of intelligent systems .      in  @xcite",
    ", we present an approach for mining descriptive community patterns according to standard community evaluation measures : the proposed method collects patterns that describe communities by combinations of features , e.g.,tags or topics for social bookmarking systems .",
    "we can consider , for example , groups of users interested in the topics _ web mining _ , _ computer _ and _",
    "java_.    in this way , we aim to _ identify and describe _ interesting communities , in contrast to standard community mining approaches , e.g. ,  @xcite , that only identify communities as subsets of users .",
    "in contrast to such global approaches , we focus on the discovery of local community patterns .",
    "according to the idea of local pattern mining , we do not try to find a complete ( global ) partitioning of the network . instead",
    ", we consider local patterns describing local communities , so - called `` nuggets '' in the data , cf .",
    "the patterns should be as exceptional as possible with respect to a given community quality measure .",
    "the pattern formalization provides an intuitive description of the community , i.e. , a characterization in terms of their descriptive features .",
    "this is usually not achieved by classical community mining methods that consider the nodes of a network ( e.g.,users in a social network ) as mere strings or ids  and provide no easily interpretable description .",
    "our proposed approach combines local pattern mining using exceptional model mining , see section  [ sec : descriptive : pattern ] , and community detection : we present an efficient algorithm for mining the top-@xmath2 community patterns with respect to a number of standard community evaluation functions , i.  e.,the novel comodoalgorithm : using _ extended frequent pattern trees _",
    "@xcite , comodoconducts an exhaustive search by traversing a representation of the pattern search space compiled into a _ community pattern tree _ ( cp - tree ) .",
    "the cp - tree is a compact version of the dataset , that also contains relevant information about the graph structure . using this tree ,",
    "the patterns can be efficiently computed using only the information contained in the tree . for pruning ,",
    "comodoutilizes optimistic estimates of the community quality functions , in a branch - and - bound fashion .",
    "therefore , we propose suitable optimistic estimates  @xcite which are efficient to compute .",
    "our approach also tackles typical problems that are not addressed by standard approaches for community detection such as pathological cases like small community sizes .",
    "furthermore , we focus on interpretable patterns that can easily be incorporated in a practical application , for example , for recommendations . since in practice",
    "the entities in a network tend to belong to a number of different communities , the presented method captures overlapping community allocations .",
    "we demonstrate our approach on networks from bibsonomy .",
    "the presented approach is not limited to social bookmarking systems and can be applied to any kind of graph - structured data for which additional descriptive features are available , e.g.,certain activity in telephone networks or interactions in face - to - face contacts that also utilize tags or topic descriptions for the contained relations .",
    "the applied optimistic estimates allow a reduction of the search space by orders of magnitude , especially using the modularity quality function .",
    "overall the proposed optimistic estimates show huge pruning potential for many applications , especially considering the local modularity measure as an effective tool for fast descriptive community mining .      in the context of descriptive pattern mining , the concept of _",
    "exceptional model mining _ has recently been introduced  @xcite .",
    "it can be considered as a generalization of typical descriptive approaches like association rule mining  @xcite , subgroup discovery  @xcite or frequent pattern mining  @xcite , and enables more complex target properties , cf .  @xcite .",
    "exceptional model mining tries to identify interesting patterns with respect to a local model derived from _ a set _ of attributes , e.g.,a correlation or a linear regression model .",
    "the interestingness can be flexibly defined , e.g.,by a significant deviation from a model that is derived from the total population or the respective complement set of instances within the population .",
    "there exist heuristic algorithms  @xcite for exceptional model mining ; however , these can not guarantee any optimality of its results , in contrast to exhaustive methods . then",
    ", efficient exhaustive methods are required due to the size of the large ( exponential ) pattern search space .",
    "possible applications include the identification of characteristic patterns  @xcite , analysis of node information in social interaction networks  @xcite , or descriptive community mining approaches  @xcite .",
    "in  @xcite , we present the novel _ gp - growth _ algorithm that can be used for mining patterns with exceptional target models _ exhaustively_. we propose the concept of valuation bases allowing us to derive a new algorithm capable of performing efficient exhaustive search for many different classes of exceptional models .",
    "we extend the well - known fp - tree data structure  @xcite by replacing the frequency information stored in each node of the tree by the more general concept of valuation bases : these are dependent on a specific _ model class _ and allow for an efficient computation of the target model parameters . intuitively , in the generalized tree ( _ gp - tree _ ) , each node stores a valuation basis that locally provides all information necessary to compute the target model parameters .",
    "we characterize the scope of the presented approach , describe properties of possible target models , and discuss its instantiations for model classes presented in literature : the applicability of the proposed approach is discussed by drawing an analogy to data stream mining , providing a constructive proof for the adaptation of the valuation base approach to other possible model classes .",
    "an evaluation of the presented approach utilizes publicly available uci data  @xcite , as well as a social data from flickr .",
    "our runtime experiments show improvements of more than an order of magnitude in comparison to a naive exhaustive depth - first search .",
    "this enables the application in large social network datasets . as an example",
    ", we used a dataset obtained from flickr containing about 1.1 million instances and about 1200 tags that were used as describing attributes .",
    "then , we aimed at identifying combinations of tags ( as descriptions ) , for which their correlation is especially strong . as a result , even for a search depth of 2 , a simple benchmark algorithm , i.  e.,depth - first - search , did not finish the task within two full days .",
    "in contrast , the same task performed by gp - growth finished in about 8 minutes , using a standard office pc with a 2.2 ghz cpu and 2 gb ram . furthermore , even for an increased search depth of 3 ,",
    "the task could be completed within 10 minutes .",
    "thus , gp - growthprovides for a fast efficient method for exceptional model mining .",
    "further speedups can then be achieved using optimistic estimates , e.g.,as discussed above in section  [ sec : descriptive : community ] .      since descriptive pattern mining characterizes and summarizes the data , it can also be applied for hypothesis generation in order to derive semi - automatic and interactive exploratory approaches .      in  @xcite , we present such an interactive exploratory approach on social interaction networks incorporating location and tagging information . in this context , location information is considered as a proxy for social relatedness and interaction , cf .",
    "@xcite for more details .",
    "furthermore , using tagging information assigned to the nodes of the network , we can also explore tag - similarity measures , e.g. ,  @xcite , as a proxy for the relatedness and interaction .",
    "we present a two way perspective on exploring locations , tags , resources and their induced interaction networks : first , we aim to describe sets of related resources ( e.g.,photos ) using location - information and tags , which are semantically related as well as focused on certain locations .",
    "we can imagine , for example , browsing the map of germany and taking an overview on the general berlin / brandenburg area in terms of tag descriptions .",
    "second , we characterize given locations using tagging patterns and photos for interactive browsing .",
    "a user may click on a map to specify his point of interest , for example , and is then provided a set of tags that are used for that region .",
    "we propose an iterative two step approach for the exploration of locations and resources : the first step uses pattern mining techniques , e.g. ,  @xcite to automatically generate a candidate set of potentially interesting descriptive tags .",
    "for a flexible characterization of locations at different levels the search can be adapted by employing different location - based target measures for pattern mining .",
    "the result of the first step is thus a set of descriptive _ interesting _ patterns . in the second step ,",
    "a human explores this candidate set of patterns and introspects interesting patterns manually by browsing and viewing various visualizations .",
    "the pattern mining parameters can be adapted in an exploratory fashion . in this way",
    ", we obtain an overview on the resources in terms of their location and describing tags .",
    "furthermore , we can characterize different regions , areas or specific locations in terms of such descriptive information .",
    "the resulting patterns can be exploited by providing different visualizations and browsing options .",
    "additionally , they can be filtered according to different interestingness criteria defined by the applied quality function .",
    "furthermore , background knowledge , e.g.,on semantically equivalent tags , can be manually refined and included in the process .",
    "we demonstrate the impact and validity of the presented approach in a case study using publicly available data from the social photo sharing application _ flickr_. we apply comodofor descriptive community mining ( see section  [ sec : descriptive : community ] ) and the efficient method sd - map *  @xcite for descriptive pattern mining .",
    "this could also be implemented using the exceptional pattern mining approach described in section  [ sec : descriptive : pattern ] .    in the case study",
    ", we show on a structural level , that the proposed approach allows us to obtain more significant communities compared to standard community detection methods as a baseline .",
    "furthermore , the interactive approach provides a good starting point for exploratory analysis as shown by an exemplary case study .",

    "<S> social media and social networks have already woven themselves into the very fabric of everyday life . </S>",
    "<S> this results in a dramatic increase of social data capturing various relations between the users and their associated artifacts . in such settings , </S>",
    "<S> data mining and analysis plays a central role : predictive data mining targets the acquisition and learning of specific models in order to support the users , e.g.,for classification or inference of parameters for future cases . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , descriptive data mining aims at obtaining patterns which summarize and characterize the data .    from an application perspective </S>",
    "<S> , there is a variety of computational social systems  with an increasing use of mobile and ubiquitous technologies . </S>",
    "<S> the various direct and indirect interactions between the users in the online networks as well as the real - world human interactions using ubiquitous devices can then be represented using social interaction networks .    in this article </S>",
    "<S> , we consider social interaction networks from a data mining perspective  also with a special focus on real - world face - to - face contact networks : we combine data mining and social network analysis techniques for examining the networks in order to improve our understanding of the data , the modeled behavior , and its underlying emergent processes . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we adapt , extend and apply known predictive data mining algorithms on social interaction networks . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we present novel methods for descriptive data mining for uncovering and extracting relations and patterns for hypothesis generation and exploration by the user , in order to provide characteristic information about the data and networks . </S>",
    "<S> the presented approaches and methods aim at extracting valuable knowledge for enhancing the understanding of the respective data , and for supporting the users of the respective systems . </S>",
    "<S> we consider data from several social systems , like the social bookmarking system bibsonomy , the social resource sharing system flickr , and ubiquitous social systems : specifically , we focus on data from the social conference guidance system _ conferator _ and the social group interaction system _ </S>",
    "<S> mygroup_.    this workfirst gives a short introduction into social interaction networks , before we describe several analysis results in the context of online social networks , as well as real - world face - to - face contact networks . </S>",
    "<S> next , we present predictive data mining methods making use of the social interactions , i.  e.,for localization , recommendation and link prediction . </S>",
    "<S> after that , we present novel descriptive data mining methods for mining communities and patterns on social interaction networks . </S>"
