    "<S> usually , it is assumed that lorentz violating parameters are independent on position @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> this results in a uniform distribution of pulsars , in agreement with statistical analysis performed in refs . @xcite . * </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism proposed in this paper does not require any correlation between the velocity @xmath199 and other physical parameters of pulsars , such as for example , the magnetic field @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is essentially due to the fact that in the standard model extension , the coefficients @xmath198 and @xmath197 describe the most general renormalizable effects that are possible in the gauge - invariant neutrino sector , no matter what are their origin at the planck scale ( they can be regarded as vacuum expectation values of tensor operators arising from the spontaneous breaking mechanism ) . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> a correlation among the coefficients @xmath198 and @xmath197 and the parameters characterizing the pulsar properties , in particular the magnetic field , is not necessarily expected . </S>",
    "<S> such a result , indeed , seems to be corroborated by recent analysis of refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in which it is pointed out the apparent lack of evidence in favor of the @xmath200 correlation correlation since the relevant magnetic field for the kick velocity is the magnetic field _ inside _ the hot neutron star during the first seconds after the supernova collapse . </S>",
    "<S> astronomical observations allow to infer the surface magnetic field some millions of years later . </S>",
    "<S> these two fields are not trivially correlated each other because of the complex evolution of the magnetic field during the cooling process of neutron star , which lead to a final ( surface ) magnetic field whose configuration is different from the initial one , i.e. few seconds after the onset of the supernova ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) . ] .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> the origin of pulsar velocities has been studied in the framework of standard model extension . </S>",
    "<S> the effective hamiltonian for the time evolution of neutrinos ( see eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ heff ] ) ) gives rise to a term of the form @xmath201 . </S>",
    "<S> the relative orientation of neutrino momenta with respect to @xmath1 leads to the fractional asymmetry necessary to the generate the observed pulsar motion . </S>",
    "<S> future observations and statistical analysis on the velocity distribution of pulsars might provide a scenario in which the lorentz and cpt invariance violation , as suggested by kosteleck , might be tested on astrophysical scales .    </S>",
