    "another innovation , the _ method of polynomial algebras _ , is described in  [ sec : meth - poly - algebr ] .",
    "it is used in constructing convenient filtrations of rings , and in forming the quotient of an equivariant commutative ring spectrum by a regular sequence , in the situation in which the group is acting non - trivially on the sequence .",
    "section  [ sec : ths - slice - filtration ] introduces the slice filtration and establishes many of its basic properties , including the strong convergence of the slice spectral sequence ( theorem  [ thm:34 ] ) , and an important result concerning the distribution of groups in the @xmath12-term ( corollary  [ thm:36 ] ) .",

    "[ sec : even - spectra ] .",

    "the exception is in  [ sec : special - case - g = ztn ] , where special methods for determining the slices of @xmath140-spectra are described .",
    "strictly speaking , these methods are not necessary for the proof of theorem  [ thm:20 ] , but they are very useful for other problems , and so have been included .    from  [ sec :",
    "case - mu ] forward we restrict attention to the case in which @xmath96 is cyclic of order a power of @xmath2 , and we localize all spectra at the prime @xmath2 . the spectra @xmath143 are introduced and some of the basic properties are established .",
    "the groundwork is laid for the proof of the slice theorem . the reduction theorem ( theorem  [ thm:21 ] )",
    "is stated in  [ sec : slice - theorem - i ] .",
    "the reduction theorem is the backbone of the slice theorem , and is the only part that is not `` formal '' in the sense that it depends on the outcome of certain computations .",

    "one is simply the wish to make this paper as self - contained as possible and to collect material central to the focus of our investigation in one place .",
    "but there is a mathematical reason as well .",
    "we have chosen to do equivariant stable homotopy theory in the category of equivariant orthogonal spectra  @xcite since it possesses the convenience of a symmetric monoidal smash product .",
    "this enables us to streamline our theory of the norm .",
    "but it comes at a cost . basing the norm on the symmetric monoidal product forces us to work with commutative ring spectra ( unital commutative monoids under the smash product ) rather than @xmath144-ring spectra .",
    "unfortunately , the spectra underlying commutative rings are never cofibrant .",
    "this means that care must be taken to ensure that a construction like the norm realizes the correct homotopy type when applied to cofibrant commutative rings .",
    "one of the main technical results of appendix  [ sec : homot - theory - equiv ] ( proposition  [ thm:16 ] ) shows that this is the case . establishing this property of commutative rings involves details of the foundations of equivariant orthogonal spectra , and can not be done at the level of user interface . because of this , a relatively complete survey of equivariant orthogonal spectra is required .",
