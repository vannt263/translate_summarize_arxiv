    "the history of quantum mechanics records that from the very beginning the founders of the quantum theory realized that there might exist formal connection between classical optics and quantum mechanics .",
    "for example , schrdinger considered that classical dynamics of a point particle should be the geometrical optics  approximation of a linear wave equation , in the same way as ray optics is a limiting approximation of wave optics ; schrdinger also searched for some quantum mechanical state which behaves like a classical ` particle ' , and this state was later recognized as the coherent state @xcite , which plays an essential role in quantum optics theory and laser physics ; as dirac wrote in his famous book @xmath1principles of quantum mechanics@xmath2@xcite : @xmath3 * for a quantum dynamic system that has a classical analogue , unitary transformation in the quantum theory is the analogue of contact transformation in the classical theory * \" . according to dirac , there should exist a formal correspondence between quantum optics unitary - transform operators and classical optics transformations .",
    "indeed , in the last century physicists also found some rigorous mathematical analogies between classical optics and quantum mechanics , i.e. the similarity between the optical helmholtz equation and the time - independent schrdinger equation ; since 1960s , the advent of a laser and the appearance of coherent state theory of radiation field @xcite , quantum optics has experienced rapid development and achieved great success in revealing and explaining the quantum mechanical features of optical field and non - classical behavior ( for instance , hanbury - brown - twiss effect , photon antibunching , squeezing , sub - poissonian photon statistics ) of photons in various photon - atom interactions @xcite . the relationship between classical and quantum coherence has been discussed in the book of mandel and wolf @xcite ; the hermite - gauss or the laguerre - gauss modes of a laser beam are described using the bosonic operator algebra by nienhuis and allen @xcite .",
    "in addition , displaced light beams refracted by lenses according to the law of geometrical optics , were found to be the paraxial optics analog of a coherent state . besides , phase space correspondence between classical optics and quantum mechanics , say for example , the wigner function theory ,",
    "is inspected in the literature @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "classical optics , which tackles vast majority of physical - optics experiments and is based on maxwell s equations , has never ceased its own evolving steps , physicists have endeavored to develop various optical transforms in light propagation through lens systems and various continuous media .",
    "the two research fields , quantum optics and classical optics , have their own physical objects and conceptions . from the point of view of mathematics , classical optics is framed in the group transform and associated representations on appropriate function space , while quantum optics deals with operators and state vectors , and their overlap seems little at first glance .",
    "it seems to us that if one wants to further relate them to each other , one needs some new theoretical method to `` bridge '' them .",
    "for example , what is the quantum mechanical unitary operator corresponding to the fresnel transform in fourier optics ?",
    "is there any so - called fresnel operator as the image of classical generalized fresnel transform ?",
    "since generalized fresnel transforms are very popularly used in optical instrument design and optical propagation through lenses and various media , it is worth of studying these transforms in the context of quantum optics theory , especially based on coherent state , squeezed state @xcite and the newly invented entangled state theory @xcite .",
    "fortunately , the recently developed technique of integration within an ordered product ( iwop ) of operators @xcite is of great aid to studying quantum optical version of classical optical transformations . using the iwop technique one may gain benefit for classical optics from quantum optics research , or vice - versa .",
    "our present review is arranged as follows : in section 2 we briefly recall the classical diffraction theory @xcite , this is preparing for later sections in which we shall show that most frequently employed classical optical transforms have their counterparts in quantum optics theory . in section 3 we introduce the iwop technique and demonstrate that the completeness relation of fundamental quantum mechanical representations can be recast into normally ordered gaussian operator form . using the iwop technique we can directly perform the asymmetric ket - bra integration @xmath4 in the coordinate representation , which leads to the normally ordered single - mode squeezing operator , this seems to be a direct way to understanding the squeezing mechanism as a mapping from the classical scaling @xmath5 . in section 4 with the help of iwop technique and based on the concept of quantum entanglement of einstein - podolsky - rosen @xcite",
    "we construct two mutually conjugate entangled states of continuum variables , @xmath6 versus @xmath7 and their _ deduced entangled states ( or named _ * correlated - amplitude  number - difference entangled states * ) , they are all qualified to make up quantum mechanical representations .",
    "it is remarkable that using the iwop technique to performing the asymmetric ket - bra integration @xmath8 leads to the two - mode normally ordered two - mode squeezing operator , this implies that the two - mode squeezed state is simultaneously an entangled state .",
    "we point out that the entangled state @xmath9 also embodies entanglement in the aspect of correlative amplitude and the phase .",
    "we are also encouraged that the overlap between two mutually conjugate _ deduced entangled states _ is just the bessel function the optical hankel transform kernel @xcite@xmath10 which again shows that the new representations in the context of physics theory match beautiful mathematical formalism exactly .",
    "we then employ the _ deduced _ entangled states to derive * quantum optical version of classical circular harmonic correlation .",
    "* section 5 is devoted to finding a quantum operator which corresponds to the optical fresnel transform , with use of the coherent state representation and by projecting the classical sympletic transform @xmath11 ( @xmath12 in phase space onto the quantum mechanical hilbert space , we are able to recognize which operator is the single - mode fresnel operator ( fo ) .",
    "it turns out that the 1-dimensional optical fresnel transform is just the matrix element of the fresnel operator @xmath13 in the coordinate eigenstates .",
    "besides , the coherent state projection operator representation of fo constitutes a loyal realization of symplectic group , which coincides with the fact that two successive optical fresnel transforms make up a new fresnel transform .",
    "then in section 6 based on the coherent state projection representation of fo , we prove @xmath14 rule for optical propagation in the context of quantum optics . in section 7 the quadratic operator form of fo",
    "is also presented and the four fundamental optical operators are derived by decomposing the fo . in section 8",
    "we discuss how to apply the fresnel operator to quantum tomography theory , by introducing the fresnel quadrature phase @xmath15 we point out that wigner operator s radon transformation is just the pure state projection operator @xmath16  @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the position eigenstate , so the probability distribution for the fresnel quadrature phase is the radon transform of the wigner function .",
    "moreover , the tomogram of quantum state @xmath20 is just the squared modulus of the wave function @xmath21 this new relation between quantum tomography and optical fresnel transform may provide experimentalists to figure out new approach for testing tomography .",
    "in addition , we propose another new theorem for calculating tomogram , i.e. , the tomogram of a density operator @xmath22 is equal to the marginal integration of the classical weyl correspondence function of @xmath23 . in section 9 by virtue of the coherent state and iwop method we propose two - mode generalized fresnel operator ( gfo ) , in this case we employ the entangled state representation to relate the 2-mode gfo to classical transforms , since the 2-mode gfo is not simply the direct product of two 1-mode gfos .",
    "the corresponding quantum optics @xmath14 rule for two - mode case is also proved .",
    "the 2-mode gfo can also be expressed in quadratic operators form in entangled way .",
    "the relation between optical ft and quantum tomography in two - mode case is also revealed . in section 10",
    "we propose a kind of integration transformation , @xmath24 which is invertible and obeys parseval theorem .",
    "remarkably , it can convert chirplet function to the kernel of fractional fourier transform ( frft ) .",
    "this transformation can also serve for solving some operator ordering problems .",
    "in section 11 we employ the entangled state representation to introduce the complex frft ( cfrft ) , which is not the direct product of two independent 1-dimensional frft transform .",
    "the eigenmodes on cfrft is derived .",
    "new eigen - modes for light propagation in graded - index medium and the fractional hankel transform are presented .",
    "the wigner transform theory is extended to the complex form and its relation to cfrft is shown ; the integration transformation in section 10 is also extended to the entangled case . in section 12",
    "we shall treat the adaption problem of collins diffraction formula to the cfrft with the use of two - mode ( 3 parameters ) squeezing operator and in the entangled state representation of continuous variables , in so doing the quantum mechanical version of associated theory of classical diffraction and classical cfrft is obtained , which connects classical optics and quantum optics in this aspect . in section 13",
    "we introduce a convenient way for constructing the fractional radon transform .",
    "the complex fractional randon transform is also proposed ; in sections 14 and 15 we discuss quantum optical version of classical wavelet transforms ( wts ) , including how to recast the condition of  mother wavelet into the context of quantum optics ; how to introduce complex wavelet transform with use of the entangled state representations .",
    "some properties , such as parseval theorem , inversion formula , and orthogonal property , the relation between wt and wigner - husimi distribution function are also discussed . in section 16 ,",
    "we generalize the usual wavelet transform to symplectic wavelet transformation ( swt ) by using the coherent state representation and making transformation @xmath25 ( @xmath12 in phase space . the relation between swt and optical fresnel transformation",
    "is revealed .",
    "then the swt is extended to the entangled case by mapping the classical mixed transformation @xmath26 in 2-mode coherent state @xmath27 representation . at the end of this section ,",
    "we introduce a new symplectic - dilation mixed wt by employing a new entangled - coherent state representation @xmath28 .",
    "the corresponding classical optical transform is also presented . in the last section ,",
    "we introduce the fresnel - hadamard combinatorial operator by virtue of the iwop technique and @xmath29 .",
    "this unitary operator plays the role of both fresnel transformation for mode @xmath30 and hadamard transformation for mode @xmath31 respectively , and the two transformations are combinatorial .",
    "all these sections are used to prove the existence of a one - to - one correspondence between quantum optical operators that transform state vectors in hilbert space and the classical optical transforms that change the distribution of optical field .",
    "here we briefly review some typical optical transforms based on light diffraction theory . these transformations ,",
    "as one can see in later sections , are just the correspondence of some representation transformations between certain quantum mechanical states of which some are newly constructed .",
    "it was huygens who gave a first illustrative explanation to wave theory by proposing every point in the propagating space as a sub - excitation source of a new sub - wave .",
    "an intuitive theory mathematically supporting huygens principle is the scalar diffraction approximation , so named because optical fields ( electromagnetic fields ) actually are vector fields , whereby the theory is valid approximately .",
    "this theory is based on the superposition of the combined radiation field of multiple re - emission sources initiated by huygens .",
    "light diffraction phenomena has played an important role in the development of the wave theory of light , and now underlies the fourier optics and information optics .",
    "the formulation of a diffraction problem essentially considers an incident free - space wave whose propagation is interrupted by an obstacle or mask which changes the phase and/or amplitude of the wave locally by a well determined factor @xcite .",
    "a more rigorous , but still in the scheme of scalar wave , derivation has been given by kirchhoff who reformulated the diffraction problem as a boundary - value problem , which essentially justifies the use of huygens principle .",
    "the fresnel - kirchhoff ( or rayleigh - sommerfeld ) diffraction formula is practically reduced to the fresnel integral formula in paraxial and far - field approximation @xcite that reads : @xmath32   \\right \\ }   dx_{1}dy_{1 } , \\label{2.1}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the optical distribution of a 2-dimensional light source and @xmath34 is its image on the observation plane , @xmath35 is the optical wavelength , @xmath36 is the wave number in the vacuum and @xmath37 is the propagation distance . when @xmath38 is satisfied , eq .",

    "the fresnel integral is closely related to the fractional fourier transform ( frft ) , actually , it has been proved that the fresnel transform can be interpreted as a scaled frft with a residual phase curvature @xcite .",
    "the frft is a very useful tool in fourier optics and information optics .",
    "this concept was firstly introduced in 1980 by namias @xcite but not brought enough attention until frft was defined physically , based on propagation in quadratic graded - index media ( grin media ) .",
    "mendlovic and ozaktas @xcite defined the @xmath40th frft as follows : let the original function be input from one side of quadratic grin medium , at @xmath41 .",
    "then , the light distribution observed at the plane @xmath42 corresponds to the @xmath40 equal to the ( @xmath43)th fractional fourier transform of the input fraction , where @xmath44 is a characteristic distance .",
    "the frft can also be implemented by lenses .",
    "another approach for introducing frft was made by lohmann who pointed out the algorithmic isomorphism among image rotation , rotation of the wigner distribution function @xcite , and fractional fourier transforming @xcite .",
    "lohmann proposed the frft as the transform performed on a function that leads to a rotation with an angle of the associated wigner distribution function , in this sense , the frft bridges the gap between classical optics and optical wigner distribution theory .",
    "recently , the frft has been paid more and more attention within different contexts of both mathematics and physics @xcite .",
    "the frft is defined as @xmath45   \\left (   x_{2},y_{2}\\right ) = \\frac{e^{i(1-\\alpha)\\frac{\\pi}{2}}}{2\\sin \\left (   \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\alpha \\right ) } \\exp \\left [   -\\frac{i\\left (   x_{2}^{2}+y_{2}^{2}\\right )   } { 2\\tan \\left ( \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\alpha \\right )   } \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ &   \\times \\int \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\frac{dx_{1}dy_{1}}{\\pi}\\exp \\left [ -\\frac{i\\left (   x_{1}^{2}+y_{1}^{2}\\right )   } { 2\\tan \\left (   \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\alpha \\right )   } \\right ]   \\exp \\left [   \\frac{i\\left (   x_{2}x_{1}+y_{2}y_{1}\\right )   } { \\sin \\left (   \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\alpha \\right )   } \\right ]   u_{1}\\left ( x_{1},y_{1}\\right )   .",
    "\\label{2.4}\\ ] ] we can see that @xmath46 is the identity operator and @xmath47 is just the fourier transform .",
    "the most important property of frft is that @xmath48 obeys the semigroup property , i.e. two successive frfts of order @xmath40  and @xmath49  makes up the frft of order @xmath50 a more general form describing the light propagation in an optical system characterized by the @xmath51   $ ] ray transfer matrix is the collins diffraction integral formula @xcite , @xmath52   \\right \\ }   dx_{1}dy_{1 } , \\label{2.5}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 if the system is lossless .",
    "one can easily find the similarity between collins formula and the frft by some scaling transform and relating the @xmath54   $ ] matrix to @xmath40 in the frft @xcite .",

    "when treating the light propagation in optical elements in near - axis approximation , matrices @xmath56 representing linear transformations are a convenient mathematical tool for calculating the fundamental properties of optical systems , which is the origin of the name of matrix optics . in cylindrical",

    "we introduce the iwop technique to demonstrate how dirac s symbolic method can be developed and be applied to quantum optics theory . also , we briefly review some properties of the entangled state @xcite and reveal the connection between the mutual transform generated by these entangled states and the hankel transform in classical optics .",
    "the history of mathematics tells us that whenever there appears a new important mathematical symbol , there coexists certain operational rules for it , the quantum mechanical operators in ket - bra projective form ( the core of dirac s symbolic method ) also need their own operational rules .",

    "we noticed that _ * newton - leibniz integration rule only applies to commuting functions of continuum variables , while operators made of dirac s symbols  ( ket versus bra , e.g. , * @xmath72 * *  of continuous parameter * * @xmath73 * * ) in quantum mechanics are usually not commutative .",
    "therefore integrations over the operators of type * * @xmath74 ( * where ket- and bra- state vectors need not to be hermitian - conjugate to each other ) can not be directly performed by the newton - leibniz rule .",
    "thus we invented an innovative technique of integration within an ordered product ( iwop ) of operators that made the integration of non - commutative operators possible .",
    "the core of iwop technique is to arrange non - commutable quantum operators within an ordered product ( say , normal ordering ) in a way that they become commutable , in this sense the gap between q - numbers and c - numbers is `` narrowed '' .",

    "after the integration over c - numbers within ordered product is performed , we can get rid of the normal ordering symbol after putting the integration result in normal ordering . @xcite.the iwop technique thus bridges this mathematical gap between classical mechanics and quantum mechanics , and further reveals the beauty and elegance of dirac s symbolic method and transformation theory .",
    "this technique develops symbolic method significantly , i. e. makes dirac s representation theory and the transformation theory more plentiful , and consequently to be better understood .",
    "the beauty and elegance of dirac s symbolic method are further revealed .",
    "various applications of the iwop technique , including constructing the entangled state , developing * the * nonlinear coherent state theory , wigner function theory , etc . are found ; many new unitary operators and operator - identities as well as new quantum mechanical representations can be derived too , which are partly * summarized in the review articles @xcite .",
    "we begin with listing some properties of normal product of operators which means all the bosonic creation operators @xmath75 are standing on the left of annihilation operators @xmath76 in a monomial of @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the order of bose operators @xmath76 and @xmath75 within a normally ordered product can be permuted .",

    "a normally ordered product can be integrated or differentiated with respect to a @xmath80-number provided the integration is convergent .      as an application of iwop , ( in the following , unless particularly mentioned , we take @xmath84 for convenience . )",

    "operator plays the role of both fresnel transformation for mode @xmath30 and hadamard transformation for mode @xmath31 respectively , and the two transformations are combinatorial .",
    "we have shown that the two transformations are concisely expressed in the coherent - entangled state representation as a projective operator in integration form .",
    "we also found that the fresnel - hadamard operator can be decomposed as @xmath1465 a fresnel operator @xmath1447 , a two - mode squeezing operator @xmath1466 and the total momentum - average position exchanging operator .",
    "physically , @xmath1467 and @xmath1453 can be two output fields of a beamsplitter .",
    "if an optical device can be designed for fresnel - hadamard combinatorial transform , then it can be directly applied to these two output fields of the beamsplitter .    in summary , although quantum optics and classical optics are so different , no matter in the mathematical tools they employed or in a conceptual view ( quantum optics concerning the wave - particle duality of optical field with an emphasis on its nonclassical properties , whereas classical optics works on the distribution aqnd propagation of the light waves ) , that it is a new exploration to link them systematically .",
    "however , in this review , via the route of developing dirac s symbolic method we have revealed some links between them by mapping classical symplectic transformation in the coherent state representation onto quantum unitary operators ( gfo ) , throughout our discussion the iwop technique is indispensable for the derivation .",
    "we have resorted to the quantum optical interpretation of various classical optical transformations by adopting quantum optics concepts such as the coherent states , squeezed states , and entangled states , etc .",
    "remarkably , we have endowed complex fractional fourier transform , hankel transform with quantum optical representation - transform interpretation .",
    "our formalism , starting from quantum optics theory , not only provides quantum mechanical account of various classical optical transformations , but also have found their way back to some new classical transformations , e.g. entangled fresnel transform , fresnel - wavelet transform , etc , which may have realistic optical interpretation in the future .",
    "as dirac predicted , functions that have been applied in classical optical problems may be translated in an operator language in quantum mechanics , and vice - versa .",
    "we expect that the content of this work may play some role in quantum states engineering , i.e. , optical field states preparation and design .",
    "once the correspondence in this respect between the two distinct fields is established , the power of dirac s symbolic method can be fully displayed to solve some new problems in classical optics , e.g. , to find new eigen - modes of some optical transforms ; to extend the research region of classical optics theoretically by introducing new transforms ( for example , the entangled fresnel transforms ) , which may bring attention of experimentalists , who may get new ideas to implement these new classical optical transformations .",
