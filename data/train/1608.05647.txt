    "consider a two - layered medium which consists of a homogeneous compressible air or fluid on top of a homogeneous isotropic elastic solid .",
    "the interface between air / fluid and solid is assumed to be an unbounded rough surface .",
    "an unbounded rough surface refers to a non - local perturbation of an infinite plane surface such that the whole surface lies within a finite distance of the original plane . as a source located in the solid",
    ", the external force generates an elastic wave , which propagates towards the interface and further excites an acoustic wave in the air / fluid .",
    "this process leads to an air / fluid - solid interaction problem with an unbounded interface separating the acoustic and elastic waves which are coupled on the interface through two continuity conditions .",
    "the first kinematic interface condition is imposed to ensure that the normal velocity of the air / fluid on one side of the boundary matches the accelerated velocity of the solid on another side .",
    "the second one is the dynamic condition which results from the balance of forces on two sides of the interface .",
    "the model problem describes the seismic wave propagation in the air / fluid - solid medium due to the excitation of an earthquake source which is located in the crust between the lithosphere and the mantle of the earth .",
    "the goal of this paper is to carry the mathematical analysis of the time - domain acoustic - elastic scattering problem in such an unbounded structure in three dimensions .",
    "this problem falls into the class of unbounded rough surface scattering problems , which have been of great interest to physicists , engineers , and applied mathematicians for many years due to their wide range of applications in optics , acoustics , radio - wave propagation , seismology , and radar techniques @xcite .",
    "the elastic wave scattering by unbounded interfaces has many important applications in geophysics and seismology .",
    "for instance , the problem of elastic pulse transmission and reflection through the earth is fundamental to the investigation of earthquakes and the utility of controlled explosions in search for oil and ore bodies @xcite .",
    "the unbounded rough surface scattering problems are quite challenging due to the unbounded surfaces .",
    "the usual sommerfeld ( for acoustic waves ) or silver  mller ( for electromagnetic waves ) radiation condition is not valid any more @xcite .",
    "the fredholm alternative theorem is not applicable either due to the lack of compactness result . for the time - harmonic problems , we refer to @xcite for some mathematical studies on the two - dimensional helmholtz equation and @xcite for the three - dimensional maxwell equations .",
    "the time - domain scattering problems have recently attracted considerable attention due to their capability of capturing wide - band signals and modeling more general material and nonlinearity @xcite , which motivates us to tune our focus from seeking the best possible conditions for those physical parameters to the time - domain problem . comparing with the time - harmonic problems ,",
    "the time - domain problems are less studied due to the additional challenge of the temporal dependence .",
    "the analysis can be found in @xcite for the time - domain acoustic and electromagnetic obstacle scattering problems .",
    "we refer to @xcite and @xcite for the analysis of the time - dependent electromagnetic scattering from an open cavity and a periodic structure , respectively .",
    "the acoustic - elastic interaction problems have received much attention in both the mathematical and engineering communities @xcite .",
    "there are also some numerical studies on the inverse problems arising from the fluid - solid interaction such as reconstruction of surfaces of periodic structures or obstacles @xcite .",
    "many approaches have been attempted to solve numerically the time - domain problems such as coupling of boundary element and finite element with different time quadratures @xcite . however , the rigorous mathematical study is still open at present .    in this work ,",
    "we intend to answer the mathematical questions on well - posedness and stability of the time - domain acoustic - elastic interaction problem in an unbounded structure .",
    "the problem is reformulated as an initial - boundary value problem by adopting an exact transparent boundary condition ( tbc ) . using the laplace transform and energy method ,",
    "we show that the reduced variational problem has a unique weak solution in the frequency domain .",
    "meanwhile , we obtain the stability estimate to show the existence of the solution in the time - domain . in addition , we achieve a priori estimates with explicit dependence on the time for the pressure of the acoustic wave and the displacement of the elastic wave by considering directly the time - domain variational problem and taking special test functions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ pf ]",
    ", we introduce the model equations and interface conditions for the acoustic - elastic interaction problem .",
    "the time - domain tbc is presented and some trace results are proved .",
    "section [ srp ] is devoted to the analysis of the reduced problem , where the well - posdeness and stability are addressed in both the frequency and time domains .",
    "we conclude the paper with some remarks in section [ cl ] .",
    "in this section , we define some notation , introduce the model equations , and present an initial - boundary value problem for the acoustic - elastic scattering in an air / fluid - solid medium .",
    "as shown in figure [ pg ] , we consider an active source which is embedded in an elastic solid medium .",
    "it models an earthquake focus located in the crust which lies between the lithosphere and the rigid mantle of the earth .",
    "due to the excitation of the source , an elastic wave is generated in the solid and propagates through to the medium of the air / fluid . clearly , this process leads to the air / fluid - solid interaction problem with the scattering interface separating the domains where the acoustic and elastic waves travel .",

    "we assume that the open space @xmath9 is filled with a homogeneous compressible air or a compressible inviscid fluid with the constant density @xmath10 .",
