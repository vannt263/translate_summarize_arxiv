    "the heavy quark electro- and photoproduction has become an increasingly important subject of study  @xcite . in particular",
    "it originates from come into operation of hera @xmath3-collider energy of which is high enough to achieve the small @xmath1 physics region .",
    "indeed first experimental results obtained at hera  @xcite showed new physical phenomena in @xmath4p- and ep - interactions at hera energies : resolved photon interactions , jets in photoproduction produced in ",
    "hard parton collisions , significant fraction of events with a large rapidity gap .",
    "the measurement of the total charm photoproduction cross section by zeus collaboration  @xcite is a very important stage of researches .",
    "the heavy quark production at hera is a very interesting and important subject of study . as it is dominated by photon - gluon fusion subprocess ( fig .",
    "1 ) one can study the gluon distribution functions @xmath5 in small @xmath1 region ( roughly at @xmath6 ) .",
    "secondly this last issue is important for physics at future colliders ( such as lhc ) : many processes at these colliders will be determined by small x gluon distributions .    at hera energies and beyond heavy quark production processes",
    "are of the so - called semihard type  @xcite . in such processes by definition a hard scattering scale",
    "@xmath7 ( or heavy quark mass @xmath8 ) is large as compared to the @xmath9 parameter , but @xmath7 is much less than the total center of mass energies : @xmath10 .",
    "last condition implies that the processes occur in small @xmath1 region : @xmath11 .",
    "in such a case the perturbative qcd expansion has large coefficients @xmath12 besides the usual renormalization group ones which are @xmath13 .",
    "so , in perturbative qcd the heavy quark photoproduction cross section ( as result of photon - gluon fusion process ) has the form  @xcite : @xmath14 + ... , where @xmath15 was calculated by ellis and nason  @xcite .",
    "the photon - gluon fusion cross section in low order decreases vs. @xmath16 at @xmath17 .",
    "but in the same limit @xmath18 , because heavy quark photoproduction cross section is dominated by the contribution of the gluon exchange in the @xmath19 - channel . these results in breakdown of standard perturbative qcd expansion and the problem of summing up all contributions of the order @xmath20 and @xmath21 in perturbative qcd appears in calculation of @xmath22 .",
    "it is known that summing up the terms of the order @xmath23 in leading logarithm approximation ( lla ) of perturbative qcd leads to the linear dglap evolution equation for deep inelastic structure function  @xcite .",
    "resummation of the large contributions of the order of @xmath24 leads to the bfkl evolution equation  @xcite and its solution gives the drastical increase of the gluon distribution : @xmath25 .",
    "the sharp growth of the parton density as @xmath26 makes the parton - parton interactions very important , which in turn makes the so - called glr evolution equation essentially nonlinear  @xcite .",
    "the growth of the parton density at @xmath27 and interactions between partons induce substantial screening ( shadowing ) corrections which restore the unitarity constrains for deep inelastic structure functions ( in particular for a gluon distribution ) in small @xmath1 region  @xcite .",
    "these facts break the assumption of the standard parton model ( spm ) about @xmath1 and transverse momentum factorization for a parton distribution functions .",
    "we should deal with the transverse momentum factorization ( @xmath0 factorization ) theory  @xcite or with the so - called semihard approach  @xcite in case of accounting for shadowing corrections at small @xmath1 besides taking into account the virtuality and the longitudinal polarizations of initial gluons .    in semihard approach  @xcite screening corrections stop the growth of the gluon distribution at @xmath27 .",
    "this effect was interpreted as saturation of the parton ( gluon ) density : gluon distribution function @xmath28 becomes proportional to @xmath29 at @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 can be considered as new phenomenological parameters : the @xmath32 is related to the size of hadron or of black spots in a hadron and the parameter @xmath34 is a typical transverse momentum of partons in the parton cascade of a hadron , which leads to natural infrared cutoff in semihard processes .",
    "the parameter @xmath34 increases with @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "so because of the high parton density in small @xmath1 region a standard methods of perturbative qcd can not be used  @xcite . in this point",
    "the semihard approach  @xcite differs from the works  @xcite where after choice of structure function at starting value @xmath35 the qcd evolution is calculated using certain equations .    in the region where the transverse mass of heavy quark @xmath36 one need to take into account the dependence of the photon - gluon fusion cross section on the virtuality and polarizations of initial gluon .",
    "thus in semihard approach the matrix elements of this subprocess differ from the ones of spm ( see for example  @xcite ) .    as for the spm calculations of the next - to - leading ( nlo ) cross section of the photoproduction of heavy quarks",
    "the review may be found in papers  @xcite .",
    "the results of  @xcite have been confirmed by smith and van neerven  @xcite .",
    "the further results for the electro- and photoproduction of heavy quarks are obtained in refs .",
    "authors of ref .",
    "@xcite note that for beauty quark production the nlo corrections are large and various estimates of corrections lead to theoretical uncertainties of the order of a factor of 2 to 3 . as it was estimated in  @xcite the total cross section for beauty quark production at hera",
    "will be only a few tens of percent large than the one - loop results  @xcite .    for charm",
    "quark theoretical uncertainties are even higher .",
    "it is known that there is also strong mass dependence of the results of calculations for charm quark production . since the mass of the charm quark is small for perturbative qcd calculations the resumme procedure",
    "@xcite is less reliable for charm quark production  @xcite .    in refs .",
    "@xcite we used the semihard approach to calculate the total and differential cross sections of the heavy quarkonium , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , photoproduction .",
    "we obtained the remarkable difference between the predictions of the semihard approach and the spm especially for @xmath2- and @xmath39-distributions of the @xmath37 mesons at hera .    in present paper",
    "we investigate the open heavy quark photoproduction processes in the semihard approach , which was used early in ref .",
    "@xcite for calculation of heavy quark production rates at hadron colliders and for prediction of @xmath37 and@xmath38 photoproduction cross sections at high energies in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "some of the results derived in this paper have already been presented in ref .  @xcite .",
    "we calculate the total and differential cross sections ( the @xmath2 and rapidity distributions ) of charm and beauty quark photoproduction via the photon - gluon fusion qcd subprocess ( fig.1 ) in the framework as for the spm calculations of the next - to - leading ( nlo ) cross section of the semihard ( @xmath0 factorization ) approach  @xcite .",
    "first of all we take into account the transverse momentum of gluon @xmath40 , its the virtuality @xmath41 and the alignment of its polarization vectors along its transverse momentum such as @xmath42  @xcite .",
    "let us define sudakov variables of the process @xmath43 ( fig.2 ) : @xmath44 where @xmath45 @xmath46 and @xmath47 are 4-momenta of the heavy quarks , @xmath48 is 4-momentum of the photon , @xmath49 is 4-momentum of the gluon , @xmath50 are transverse 4-momenta of these ones . in the center of mass frame of colliding particles",
    "we can write @xmath51 , @xmath52 , where @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "sudakov variables are expressed as follows : @xmath56 where @xmath57 , @xmath58 are rapidities of heavy quarks , m is heavy quark mass .    from conservation laws",
    "we can easly obtain the following conditions : @xmath59 the differential cross section of heavy quark electroproduction has form : @xmath60 for photoproduction process it reads : @xmath61 we use generalized gluon structure function of a proton @xmath62 which is obtained in semihard approach . when integrated over transverse momentum @xmath63 @xmath64 of gluon up to some limit @xmath65 it becomes the usual structure function giving the gluon momentum fraction distribution at scale @xmath65 : @xmath66 in our calculation we use the following phenomenological parametrizations  @xcite : @xmath67 @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 mev , @xmath73 = 1/3 .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath74 mb of the structure function @xmath75 in ( 7 ) was obtained in  @xcite where @xmath76-pair production at tevatron energy was described .",
    "thus the normalization constant c includes the so - called soft @xmath77factor , which takes into account @xmath78 corrections due to soft gluon radiation .",
    "the typical value of @xmath77factor in hard hadron - hadron interactions is @xmath79 . as it was noted in ref .",

    "solid curves correspond to the semihard approach predictions and dashed curves correspond to the spm results with the grv lo parametrization of the gluon distribution  @xcite .",
    "we used in our calculations @xmath104 gev and @xmath105 gev .",
    "3a shows us that the solid curve for charm quark cross section obtained in semihard approach with parametrization ( 7 ) describes new zeus data  @xcite as well as data from earlier fixed target experiments in the range @xmath106 gev . the curve of the parametrization ( 8) ( fig .",
    "3b ) describes better the experimental data at low energies ( @xmath107 gev ) but gives worse description zeus data  @xcite .",
    "there are some differences between the theoretical curves and zeus experimental data ( figs .  3 ) .",
    "if these ones will remain valid for new data , then its will show to essential resolved photon contribution  @xcite and a sensitivity of charm photoproduction cross section to the photon structure function  @xcite .",
    "we would like to note that our results for the parametrization ( 7 ) coincide with the results from ref .",

    "the saturation effects in the gluon distribution function are important for charm quark photoproduction in semihard approach ( fig.4 ) : the c - quark cross section grows more slowly at these energies ( solid curve ) . the beauty quark photoproduction cross section predicted by semihard approach is larger than the one predicted by spm at all energies ( fig .",
    "our conclusion for b - quark photoproduction is the same as in ref .",

    "this behaviour of c - quark @xmath2 distributions in the @xmath0 factorization approach results from the off mass shell subprocess cross section as well as the saturation effects of the gluon structure function , because of @xmath115 at hera energies . in the case of beauty quarks",

    "we showed that the semihard approach describes experimental data for the charm photoproduction cross section at low and hera energies , leads to the saturation effects for the total cross section of charm quark photoproduction at @xmath111 gev as well as to exceeding over the spm prediction for beauty quark total cross section at the energy range of @xmath120 gev , and predicts a marked difference for rapidity and transverse momentum distributions of charm and beauty quark photoproduction , which can be studied already at hera @xmath121collider .",
