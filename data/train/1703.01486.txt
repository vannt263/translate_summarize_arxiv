    "<S> the main goal of this letter is to draw attention to previously unknown type of optimal behaviour in first - passage phenomena : a carefully chosen rate of poisson restart brings the probability of observing a particular completion scenario to a maximum ( or minimum ) . in other words </S>",

    "<S> we show that optimality of the splitting probabilities always entails an exact match between the unconditional and conditional mean completion times of the process . </S>",

    "<S> we will use the same `` drosophila '' to demonstrate the ability of stochastic restart to optimize the splitting probabilities . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , let us consider a mortal brownian searcher with the diffusion constant @xmath0 and the mortality rate @xmath1 which starts from the initial position @xmath2 . </S>",

    "<S> if @xmath1 is large compared to @xmath16 , then the typical size of the region explored by the searcher during its lifespan is less than the initial distance to the target and , thus , a non - vanishing restart inevitably leads to reduction of the search efficiency . </S>",

    "<S> then , the non - vanishing restart rate censors the fatal paths and increases chances to find the target . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> too large restart rate hinders target detection since the searcher has less time between restarts to reach the origin under the same mortality rate . </S>",
    "<S> this is why there exists a non - vanishing optimal restart rate @xmath17 which brings the probability that searcher will find the target before dying to a maximum .    </S>",

    "<S> , one can construct an infinite number of examples belonging to this class . </S>",
    "<S> what do they all have in common ? to address this question let us take a look at the first - passage - time properties of the process illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a . </S>",
    "<S> as it is shown in @xcite , the completion time @xmath46 of a generic first - passage process under a generic restart mechanism obeys the following identity @xmath47 in which @xmath48 is an independent and identically distributed copy of @xmath46 . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ conditional_mfpt ] ) vanishes and we get @xmath56 also , since @xmath57 , similar identity holds true for the mean completion time of failed trials : @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> we thus conclude that when the rate of poisson restart is optimal , in the sense that it maximizes or minimizes the probability to observe specific outcome , the unconditional mfpt is equal to the mfpt conditional to this outcome . </S>",
    "<S> this universal feature is shared by all optimally restarted processes irrespective on their fine details ( see the left panel of fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> pic : mfpt ] for illustration ) .    </S>",
    "<S> surprising simplicity of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ mfpt_identity ] ) calls for its intuitive explanation . to provide such an explanation </S>",
    "<S> let us assume that one starts to observe a first - passage process , which is allowed to repeat itself over and over , at a random moment of time . </S>",
    "<S> what is then the _ expected probability _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath59 of getting success in the next outcome ? </S>",
    "<S> it can be shown that this probability is given by @xmath60 ( see supplementary material ) . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , applying poisson restart with infinitesimally small rate @xmath61 will increase the chances of success whenever @xmath62 , while at @xmath63 the effect will be opposite . at the same time , if the process is already restarted at the optimal rate @xmath17 , then @xmath64_{r^*}=0 $ ] and small additional correction @xmath61 to @xmath17 does not change the probability of success @xmath65 in the leading order approximation . </S>",

    "<S> interestingly , the match of unconditional and conditional mfpts is an inherent property of some two - thresholds first - passage processes relevant to kinetics of enzyme reactions @xcite , motor proteins dynamics @xcite , entropy - production fluctuations @xcite and decision making @xcite . from the foregoing considerations it follows that for all these processes the splitting probabilities coincide with the corresponding expected splitting probabilities .    anticipating that optimization is not an exclusive prerogative of poisson restart </S>",
    "<S> , it is natural to ask how to choose a restart time distribution @xmath28 which provides the maximum probability of success @xmath7 for a given first - passage process . </S>",

    "<S> this observation is explained by the relation @xmath78 which is valid whenever the mortality rate @xmath1 is time - independent . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the price one has to pay for attaining the higher probability of success via optimal deterministic restart is the relatively longer average completion time of successful trials . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the conditional and unconditional mean first - passage times of a process undergoing optimally tuned deterministic restart obey the universal inequality constraint @xmath79 to prove eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ mfpt_enequality ] ) , let us assume that the process , which is being restarted deterministically in an optimal way , becomes subject to additional poisson restart with an infinitesimally small rate @xmath61 . that produces a deferential correction @xmath80 to the probability of success @xmath70 attained by deterministic restart . </S>",
    "<S> equation ( [ conditional_mfpt ] ) allows us to write @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> due to dominance of deterministic restart over other restart strategies , one can be sure that @xmath82 and , therefore , @xmath83 . taking into account the identity @xmath57 , one arrives at the opposite inequality for the mfpt of failed trials : @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> these features of deterministic restart are clearly seen in the right panel of fig [ pic : mfpt ] .    _ </S>",
    "<S> conclusion._ first - passage processes exhibiting stochasticity not only in the timing of their evolution but also in the very result of the evolution are ubiquitous in science . </S>",
    "<S> when the possible outcomes of a process are not equally valuable , the splitting probabilities may come to the fore as a crucial measure of efficiency and reliability @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> splitting probabilities are also the informative metrics used to characterize the structural and dynamic properties of complex networks @xcite and the conformational states of biological macromolecules @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in this letter we applied a general theoretical approach to describe the effect of restart on the splitting probabilities of a process with exactly two possible completion scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that a carefully chosen rate of poisson restart could maximize ( minimize ) the probability that the process will complete in the desirable ( undesirable ) way . </S>",
    "<S> whenever it is the case , the conditional and unconditional mfpts are equal to each other . </S>",
    "<S> we also established the global dominance of deterministic restart in the entire space of restart strategies - further evidence of the great optimization potential of deterministic restart in first - passage problems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that these conclusions are robust to appearance of a generally distributed random time penalty for restart ( see supplementary material ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , our work adds to the collection of universal results in the field of first - passage phenomena @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this paper covers only some of many interesting questions relating to the effect of restart on the first - passage processes with plural outcomes . </S>",
    "<S> particularly , we have only considered the mean conditional first - passage times , thus , leaving aside the issue of fluctuations . since in many settings the time required for process completion is not less important than the outcome of the process , it would be also interesting to consider the problem of optimization over both the splitting probabilities and the mean first - passage time . </S>",
    "<S> finally , note that while looking for the optimal restart strategy we did not take into account possible cost associated with its implementation @xcite . </S>",
