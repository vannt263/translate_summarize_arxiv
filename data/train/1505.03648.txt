    "the all sky automated survey ( asas , @xcite ) project started in 1996 with the observations in the southern hemisphere aimed at classification and investigation about 10@xmath0 stars that show photometric variability in their light curves .",
    "the observations were carried out with the ccd cameras having 4k and 2k resolutions in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 filters at the stations located in chile and hawaii .",
    "the main scope of the survey was to form the asas catalog of variable stars ( acvs ) and 39000 new variables were discovered so far .",
    "@xcite included ao  aqr into their catalogue of eclipsing binary stars .",
    "they listed the fundamental parameters of the components and classified the system as f type with uncertainty . @xcite",
    "categorized ao  aqr to be a contact binary system which mostly show ew and eb  type light curves in a statistical study of 1000 eclipsing binary systems .",
    "@xcite determined the accurate position of the system by using the right ascension and declination values .",
    "@xcite grouped the system as ew  type with an orbital period of 0.6984 and the spectral type of f. a variable classification catalogue based on the northern sky variability survey was published by @xcite .",
    "the same authors classified the star as w  uma type with an orbital period , position and magnitude values in different filters .",
    "the star cw  aqr was first mentioned as a variable by @xcite .",
    "the author provided some basic properties of 115 variable stars and noted that cw  aqr is a binary system with a short orbital period .",
    "the system was also classified as near ",
    "contact binary with spectral type of a9 by @xcite .",
    "@xcite included the system into their catalogue of eclipsing binaries .",
    "the evolutionary status of the system was found to be near  contact showing eb - type light curve according to their classification .    although no other study focusing on the star asas  012206 - 4924.7 was available in the literature the fundamental parameters of the system ( orbital period , a time of minimum light and magnitude in the v filter )",
    "were given by the asas database ( table  [ tablis ] ) .",
    "the system is also included as eclipsing detached binary in the asas catalogue .",
    "in this paper we present the details of the first analyses of the asas light curves in the next section .",
    "the light elements and absolute parameters are given in sect .",
    "we briefly discuss our results and the evolutionary properties of the systems in the last section .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
