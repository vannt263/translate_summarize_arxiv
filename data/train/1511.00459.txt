    "hadean rocks have not been found on earth until today , and the age of the oldest rock is about 4.0 ga . no continental crust may have existed on the hadean earth . however , some zircons that formed during the hadean eon were found in jack hills sedimentary rocks @xcite .",
    "since zircons are formed by igneous activity at the same time as granite , this discovery suggests that the hadean continental crust existed but later disappeared .",
    "the disappearance of the continental crust could be accounted for by geological activity such as reworking or plate tectonics , and erosion of the crusts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "another possibility is excavation / melting of the continental crust by the late heavy bombardment ( lhb ) , a concentration of impacts considered to have existed in the last phase of the hadean eon . in this paper",
    ", we calculate the effects of lhb on hadean continental crust in order to investigate this hypothesis .",
    "a classic scenario of lhb has been based on the fact that radiometric dates of lunar basins impact melts were concentrated at 3.9 ga @xcite . in this model ,",
    "about 15 lunar basins are considered to be formed between 3.9 and 3.8 ga ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite argued from ar - geochronology of lunar meteorites that the concentration at 3.9 ga is not required and @xcite claimed that the decrease of lunar crater density is just the tail of the planetesimal accretion .",
    "the most recent model proposed a sawtooth - like timeline of impact flux @xcite .",
    "if lhb was caused by a disturbance in the ancient main belt asteroids , the impact flux decreased exponentially after the onset of lhb @xcite .",
    "this exponential curve fits the lunar crater density curve very well if the disturbance occurred at 4.1 ga @xcite .",
    "it is adjusted in order to explain the accreted mass of highly siderophile elements ( hse ) of the moon after the moon formation giant impact .",
    "@xcite argued that the cause of lhb was the migration of jupiter and other giant planets predicted in the nice model .",
    "the migration of the giant planets moved some resonances and scattered the main belt asteroids and outer comets .",
    "the estimate for coverage of the earth s surface by impact craters depends on the impactors size - frequency distribution ( sfd ) .",
    "the estimates with unconstrained sfd predicted diverse results ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". furthermore , stochastic one or two huge impacts could give considerable effects @xcite .",
    "recently , using a more constrained sfd corresponding to the current main belt asteroids with the total lhb mass of @xmath1 g , @xcite showed that lhb may not have melted all of hadean continental crust .",
    "they computed 3d temperature distributions of the crust using an analytical shock - heating model with effects of impact melt generation , uplift , and ejecta heating .",
    "the result is that 1.52.5% of the upper 20 km of the crust was melted during lhb , and only 0.31.5% was melted through lhb period .",
    "they also indicated that 510% of the earth s surface area was covered by over 1 km depth of impact melt sheets , and the entire surface was covered by impact ejecta close to 1 km deep .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite suggested that hadean impacts could explain the absence of early terrestrial rocks based on the sawtooth - like timeline , with the current main belt asteroids sfd .",
    "the key point of @xcite is the `` stochastic '' nature of lhb .",
    "they showed that the melting volume deeply depended on whether very large impactors hit earth or not .",
    "another key point is the effect of `` impact - induced decompression '' and subsequent adiabatic melting of rising material in the mantle , which increases the total melting volume .",
    "they claimed that these flood melts from under the crust emerge when the impactors diameters were greater than 100 km .",
    "the melts flowed on the earth s surface like spherical caps .",
    "the melt sheets diameters were about 2030 times as large as that of the impactors , for an assumed melt thickness of 3 km .",
    "the result is that 70100% of the earth s surface area was covered by the melt sheets since 4.15 ga , and 400600% was covered during the period 4.54.15 ga .",
    "this value of the total melting area on the earth s surface is about ten times as large as that of @xcite .      because these previous works were carried out based on respective model of the impactor s sfd and the effects of impact , the results were inconsistent with each other .",
    "this work is going to investigate the effects of the slope of the impactor s sfd , which is the main new contribution of this work .",
    "the sfd of lhb impactors is still controversial .",
    "some studies claim that the lunar craters sfd is consistent with the current main belt asteroids sfd ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows that the current main belt asteroids sfd can be approximated as @xmath2 , where ( minus ) @xmath0 is the power index of the mass - frequency distribution @xcite . on",
    "the other hand , analytical theory of the evolution of sfd in a collision cascade predicted that @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "corresponding to these uncertainties in the lhb impactors sfd , we here consider a wide variety of sfds . in order to reveal intrinsic physics more clearly",
    ", we approximate the sfd as a power - law function with a broad range of the power index @xmath0 , rather than adopting a single more detailed sfd . the number of impactors heavier than @xmath4 , @xmath5 , is defined as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a proportional constant .",

    ", we evaluate total effects with a fixed total mass of impactors and the two lunar constraints  the maximum size of basin formed during lhb and the small craters density .",
    "we also investigate the dependence of the power index @xmath0 of sfd . in section 4",
    ", we discuss whether lhb can explain the absence of hadean rocks .",

    "we also discuss the validity of our assumptions and models . in section 5",
    ", we summarize this paper .",
    "appendix [ appendix ] is devoted to the calculation of the value of @xmath0 which fulfills both the lunar constraints .",
    "we consider a single impact causes direct excavation / melting and subsequent excavation / melting .",
    "formation of transient crater and melting by shock heating cause `` direct excavation / melting , '' while formation of final crater and uplifted or excavated molten rock spreading on and beyond the final crater cause `` subsequent excavation / melting , '' respectively . in this work , these effects are denoted @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 for direct effects , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 for subsequent effects ( fig .",

    "above , we only estimated the effects of lhb . however , several impacts occurred during the middle of the hadean eon and much more impacts occurred at the beginning of it . in the first few hundred million years of the hadean eon , impacts melted ( or excavated ) hadean continental crust right after they formed , and the continental crust must not have had time to grow sufficiently .",
    "we have investigated by analytical arguments the possibility for lhb impacts to excavate / melt hadean continental crust . in order to reveal intrinsic physics ,",
    "we adopt simple power - law impactors sfd with various exponents @xmath0 , rather than a single detailed sfd .",

    "we estimated the total lhb effects from the total mass of lhb impacts and two types of constraints on the moon , the size of the largest basin during lhb and the small crater density .    with the fixed total lhb mass , the total direct melting area on the earth s surface",
    "is generally regulated by small ( large ) impacts , for large ( small ) @xmath0 .",
    "the estimates from the lunar constraints suggest that lhb can excavate / melt almost all of hadean continental crust in narrow @xmath0 ranges . estimating from the size of the imbrium basin",
    ", lhb can remove the continental crust only at @xmath92 ( excavation ) and @xmath93 ( melting ) , while estimating from the lunar crater density , only at @xmath94 ( excavation and melt ) .",
    "in contrast , the subsequent melts which spread on and beyond the final craters can cover over 70% of the earth s surface in all @xmath0 ranges ( estimated from the size of the imbrium basin ) or when about @xmath95 ( estimated from the lunar crater density ) .",
    "however , the most likely value of @xmath0 is 1.61.7 .",
    "we conclude that lhb impacts would not excavate / melt all of hadean continental crust directly , but most of the earth s surface could be covered by melts of subsequent impact effects .",
    "it suggests the absence of hadean rocks could be explained by lhb if the stratigraphic succession has been preserved until today because most of hadean continental crust is not be exposed on the earth s surface in this case .",

    "<S> no hadean rocks have ever been found on earth s surface except for zircons  evidence of continental crust , suggesting that hadean continental crust existed but later disappeared . </S>",
    "<S> one hypothesis for the disappearance of the continental crust is excavation / melting by the late heavy bombardment ( lhb ) , a concentration of impacts in the last phase of the hadean eon . in this paper , we calculate the effects of lhb on hadean continental crust in order to investigate this hypothesis . </S>",
    "<S> approximating the size - frequency distribution of the impacts by a power - law scaling with an exponent @xmath0 as a parameter , we have derived semi - analytical expressions for the effects of lhb impacts . </S>",
    "<S> we calculated the total excavation / melting volume and area affected by the lhb from two constraints of lhb on the moon , the size of the largest basin during lhb , and the density of craters larger than 20 km . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigated the effects of the value of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that lhb does not excavate / melt all of hadean continental crust directly , but over 70% of the earth s surface area can be covered by subsequent melts in a broad range of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> if there have been no overturns of the continental crust until today , lhb could be responsible for the absence of hadean rocks because most of hadean continental crust is not be exposed on the earth s surface in this case . </S>"
