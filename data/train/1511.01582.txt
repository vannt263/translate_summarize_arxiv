    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are the most violent explosive events occurring at the cosmological distances . after their prompt emission , a relativistic jet interacts with its ambient medium , leading to two shocks : a reverse shock that propagates into the jet and a forward shock that propagates into the medium .",
    "afterglows are thought to be produced from these shocks ( for reviews see piran 1999 ; van paradijs et al .",
    "2000 ; mszros 2002 ; zhang & mszros 2004 ) . since the first optical afterglow was discovered in grb 970228 ( groot et al .",
    "1997 ; van paradijs et al .",
    "1997 ) , many optical afterglows have been detected ( for a summary see li et al .",
    "2012 ; liang et al .",
    "2013 ) , of which only about ten have been detected with polarized emission ( i.e. , covino et al .",
    "early optical afterglows as well as their polarization evolution are particularly important , because they may provide useful information about the grb jets and central engines .",
    "for example , with polarization observations of early optical afterglows of grb 090102 ( steele et al .",
    "2009 ) and grb 060418 ( mundell et al .",
    "2007 ) , it was suggested that the magnetization degree in the ejecta of these two bursts may range from 0.01 to 0.1 ( kobayashi 2012 ) .",
    "dynamics which describes the evolution of forward - reverse shocks or a relativistic forward shock has been discussed widely ( blandford & mckee 1976 ; sari & piran 1995 ; huang et al .",
    "1999 , hereafter hdl99 ; kobayashi 2000 ; peer 2012 ; nava et al . 2013 ) . at an early stage , assuming equality of the pressure and velocity along a contact discontinuity between the two shocks , the dynamics of a system containing the two shocks can be derived under two extreme conditions , i.e. thick - shell and thin - shell ( sari @xmath2 piran 1995 ; kobayashi 2000 ) . at a very late stage ,",
    "the system enters the sedov - taylor evolution phase and its dynamics can be derived from the conservation of the kinetic energy .",
    "so there is a transition between these two phases .",
    "hdl99 studied the dynamics of a forward shock by considering the conservation of the kinetic energy and proposed a generic dynamical model , which can describe the hydrodynamic evolution from the early ultrarelativistic phase to late non - relativistic phase .",
    "peer ( 2012 ) developed a slightly - different dynamical model , which includes contribution of the pressure of the shock - heated inter - stellar medium to the total energy of the system .",
    "recently , nava et al . (",
    "2013 ) considered a time - varying radiative efficiency of the shock and their dynamical equations are valid for an arbitrary density profile , especially for an electron - positron - pair - enriched medium . in this paper , we study the evolution of the system including contributions from forward - reverse shocks by considering conservation of the kinetic energy of the system .    whether an early optical afterglow is bright or dark depends mainly on the magnetization degree of the jet , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the luminosities of the poynting flux and the kinetic flux , respectively .",
    "if the magnetization degree of the jet is very high , i.e. @xmath6 , the reverse shock emission will be suppressed dramatically ( zhang & kobayashi 2005 ) .",
    "this may be the reason for many grbs that do not have very bright early optical afterglow .",
    "this implies that the grb jet with a bright early optical afterglow should be mainly composed of baryons and leptons . in this paper",
    ", we show that magnetic field configuration of the jet will affect the polarization evolution significantly .",
    "we discuss two magnetic field configurations , i.e. toroidal and aligned ( spruit et al . 2001 ; lazzati 2006 ) . in the forward shocked region , because there is no mechanism or process that can produce a large - scale ordered magnetic field , we only consider the random magnetic field in this region and assume that this random field is within the shock plane .",
    "the jet structure may also play an important role in the polarization evolution .",
    "here we only consider a homogeneous ( top - hat ) jet .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows . in section 2",
    ", we present our hydrodynamic model , which extends the generic model of hdl99 by considering the forward - reverse shock interaction . in section 3 , large - scale magnetic field and polarization models of grb jets in the early afterglow phase",
    "are described . in section 4",
    ", we present our numerical results of the light curves and polarization evolution of early afterglows for different hydrodynamics and for different large - scale magnetic field configurations . in section 5",
    ", we apply our model to grb 120308a , and successfully interpret the light curve and polarization evolution of the early afterglow of grb 120308a . in section 6 , conclusions and discussion are presented .",
    "an ultrarelativistic jet ( i.e. ejecta ) from the grb central engine collides with an ambient gas ( for simplicity in this work we consider an interstellar medium , ism ) , generating two shocks : a reverse shock and a forward shock .",
    "four regions are separated by these two shocks , i.e. , the unshocked jet ( region 4 ) , the shocked jet ( region 3 ) , the shocked ism ( region 2 ) and the unshocked ism ( region 1 ) .",

    "@xmath18 is the mass in region 3 , i.e. , the mass swept by the reverse shock .",
    "we assume that the newly shocked electrons instantaneously radiate a fraction @xmath19 for the reverse shock and @xmath20 for the forward shock of their internal energy ( the cooling of protons is inefficient and can be neglected ) .",
    "hereafter we define physical quantities in the comoving frame with a prime .",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 are the internal energy of the reverse shock and forward shock , respectively .",

    "@xmath39 and @xmath40 are the comoving number densities of region 3 and of region 4 , respectively . due to the radial spreading , the width of the ejecta increases with time , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the initial width . since the comoving spreading speed @xmath43 and the comoving time @xmath44 , the width of the ejecta increases with radius as @xmath45 . in the thick shell case ,",
    "the initial width of the ejecta is so large that the ejecta does not experience significant radial spreading even at the time the reverse shock crosses the whole ejecta . in this case",
    ", the number density of region 4 decreases with radius as @xmath46 . on the other hand , in the thin shell case",
    ", the initial width is so small that during the reverse shock crossing the ejecta , the width of the ejecta is dominated by the radial expansion .",
    "therefore in this case @xmath47 . according to the shock jump condition , @xmath48 .",
    "the shocked mass in region 3 is @xmath49 with @xmath50 .",
    "we do not consider the adiabatic loss because its effect on the hydrodynamic evolution of the system is negligible when the reverse shock is still crossing .",
    "the decrease of the total kinetic energy of the system is due to the energy that is radiated away , i.e. , @xmath51 therefore , equation ( 1 ) can be easily reduced to @xmath52 of hdl99 with @xmath24 and @xmath53 before @xmath23 and with @xmath54 and @xmath55 after @xmath23 , as hdl99 did not take into account the internal energy of the ejecta through the reverse shock heating in their hydrodynamic treatment .    combing equation ( 1 ) and equation ( 2 ) , the hydrodynamics before and after the reverse shock crossing time evolves as @xmath56m_{rs } } , \\ \\",

    "after @xmath23 , if we ignore the internal energy of the reverse shocked region , i.e. @xmath54 and @xmath62 , equation ( 4 ) is reduced to be exactly consistent with equation ( 7 ) of hdl99 .",
    "relativistic shocks usually have a negligible width of the shocked region compared with the radius ( blandford & mckee 1976 ) , so we assume regions 2 , 3 and 4 have the same radius which increases with the observer s time as ( see also hdl99 ) due to the relativistic propagation effect , @xmath63    from equation ( 96 ) of mignone et al .",

    "after @xmath23 , this volume becomes @xmath80 .",
    "early optical flashes of grbs are widely thought to be generated by a reverse shock .",
    "this requires that the magnetization degree of the ejecta can not be high .",
    "otherwise , the emission from the reverse shock will be suppressed seriously ( zhang & kobayashi 2005 ) .",
    "initially , the ejecta from the central engine might have a very high magnetization degree ( @xmath6 ) , depending on the nature of the central engine . during the prompt phase , shells with different velocities within the ejecta",
    "collide with each other , so that magnetic fields in the shells will be disturbed and magnetic - reconnection processes might happen ( zhang & yan 2011 ; deng et al .",
    "2015 ) . after the prompt phase ,",
    "the magnetization degree of the ejecta may decrease to a moderate level ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "thus , the ejecta in the early afterglow phase may be mainly composed of baryons and leptons and a large - scale , ordered magnetic field remains in the ejecta during the afterglow phase .",
    "two ordered magnetic field configurations in the ejecta are considered , i.e. toroidal and aligned ( spruit et al . 2001 ; lazzati 2006 ) . the random magnetic field generated by the reverse shock in region 3",
    "is neglected and we assume that in region 3 , the ratio of the energy density of the ordered magnetic field and the internal energy is @xmath82 , which is in fact about @xmath83 of the magnetization parameter @xmath84 for @xmath85 .",
    "we assume that in the early afterglow phase @xmath84 does not evolve significantly and keeps as a constant . in our calculation , the value of @xmath84 is small ( @xmath86 so that @xmath87 ) and the magnetic energy of the ordered field is frozen in region 3 . therefore , our dynamics discussed in section 2 is reasonable without considering the effect of the poynting flux to the jump condition as well as to the total kinetic energy . since the ordered magnetic field in the ism may be very weak or even do not exist , we only consider the random magnetic field generated by the forward shock in region 2 . for simplicity , we consider that the random field in the forward shocked region is in the shock plane ( for a discussion see toma et al .",
    "2009 ) .    for grbs , two possible kinds of central engine",
    "are black holes ( narayan , paczyski , & piran 1992 ; woosley 1993 ; mszros & rees 1997 ; paczyski 1998 ) and magnetars ( usov 1992 ; duncan & thompson 1992 ; kluniak & ruderman 1998 ; dai & lu 1998a,1998b ; spruit 1999 ; ruderman , tao , & kluniak 2000 ; wheeler et al .",
    "if the central engine is a black hole , the blandford - znajek mechanism would work and a magnetized jet can be powered ( blandford & znajek 1977 ) , in which the magnetic field is very likely to be toroidally ordered . for a magnetar central engine ,",
    "however , the ordered magnetic field in the jet is possibly aligned .",
    "if the magnetic field is completely random , the net polarization should be zero .",
    "if some anisotropy exists , as discussed by sari ( 1999 ) , the net polarization will appear .",
    "here we assume that the random magnetic field is in the shock plane which is probably generated by the forward shock . because the direction of the magnetic field in a point - like region is random",

    "the direction of the magnetic field @xmath101 is described by its polar and azimuthal angles @xmath88 and @xmath102 . because we assume that the magnetic field is confined in the shock plane , so we set another coordinate system @xmath103 with @xmath96 being the direction of the velocity of the jet element and @xmath100 in the @xmath104 plane .",

    "3 . in fig . 4 , due to the nonzero @xmath145 in the aligned magnetic field configuration , the evolution of the position angle is much complicated , which can be estimated by eq.(28 ) . the position angles for almost all the observing angles ( except @xmath217 ) change their direction by @xmath1 abruptly once or twice with nonzero polarization degree , and such changes happen around the crossing time @xmath23 .",
    "as interpreted from the theoretical aspect in the previous section , this abrupt @xmath218 change of the position angle corresponds to the moment when @xmath156 crosses zero due to the transition of the dominant term by @xmath125 and @xmath146 which have different signs .",
    "as long as the los locates within the jet cone ( @xmath219 , and @xmath213 ) , the polarization degree is always at a constant high level of @xmath220 before the reverse shock crosses the ejecta",
    ".    figs .",
    "5 and 6 correspond to case 2 .",
    "the crossing time of the reverse shock in this case is about 66 s. the magnetic field configuration is toroidal for fig . 5 and aligned for fig .",
    "as the forward shock dominates the whole emission , the net polarization degree for @xmath221 ( los within the jet cone ) is nearly zero or very small for the whole time . for @xmath215 and @xmath216 ,",
    "as the los locates far from the jet cone , the polarization degree at late time ( @xmath222 ) can reach a relatively high level ( @xmath223 ) . however , such polarized emission is difficult to be detected , because prompt grb emission should be extremely weak and can not trigger the gamma - ray detector for such a large viewing angle . in fig .",
    "6 , the position angle for @xmath224 stays constant for the whole time , while the change of the position angle for the other @xmath225 values is gradual .",
    "it should be noted that according to the lower panel of fig .",
    "6 , the position angle for @xmath2261.0 , 2.0 , and 3.0 is the same for the early and late times , and its maximal change ( @xmath227 ) happens around the reverse shock crossing time @xmath23 .    figs . 7 and 8 show the light curves and polarization evolution of optical afterglows with different magnetic field configuration in case 3 .",
    "the crossing time of the reverse shock in this case is about 123 s. fig .",
    "7 corresponds to a toroidal magnetic field configuration , while fig .",
    "8 corresponds to an aligned magnetic field configuration . as we know , the difference between case 2 and case 3 is that in the former case the reverse shock is initially non - relativistic ( thin shell ) while in the latter case the reverse shock is relativistic ( thick thell ) . so the rising part of the light curve before the afterglow peak has different power law slope for these two cases .",
    "another main difference between case 2 and case 3 is the polarization position angle evolution in the aligned magnetic field configuration .",
    "contrary to case 2 ( lower panel in fig .",
    "6 ) , the position angle is different for different viewing angles ( i.e. for @xmath228 , 2.0 , and 3.0 ) at early times ( @xmath229 ) , as can be seen in fig .",
    "8 . for viewing angles @xmath224 and 0.6 , the position angle before the reverse shock crossing",
    "time is almost a constant .",
    "all of the position angles with different @xmath135 , expect for @xmath230 , are convergent to the same value soon after the reverse shock crossing time .",
    "figs . 9 and 10",
    "correspond to case 4 .",
    "the crossing time of the reverse shock is about 66 s. the magnetic field configuration is toroidal for fig . 9 and aligned for fig . 10 . in case 4 , for both magnetic field configurations",
    ", there is a peak in the polarization degree evolution at @xmath23 for all the observing angles discussed in this paper , expect that for @xmath231 in the toroidal magnetic field configuration . in the toroidal magnetic field configuration ,",
    "the peak value of @xmath157 is quite different , @xmath232 for @xmath233 , while @xmath157 is much smaller for @xmath234 .",
    "after the crossing time the polarization degree declines and crosses over zero , which corresponds to a sudden rotation of the position angle by 90@xmath170 . in the aligned magnetic field configuration ,",
    "the peak value of @xmath168 is @xmath235 no matter the los locates inside the jet cone or outside the jet cone . in this configuration ,",
    "the position angles for almost all the observing angles ( except @xmath217 ) change their direction by @xmath1 abruptly twice , once before @xmath23 and another after @xmath23 . for the aligned magnetic field configuration , when position angle changes its direction abruptly by @xmath1 , the polarization degree is not necessarily to be zero .",
    "although case 4 and case 1 are both reverse shock dominated cases , the afterglow light curves have different rising slopes before @xmath23 .",
    "typically , case 4 ( thin shell ) has more rapid rising light curve than case 1 ( thick shell ) . according to our results , the polarization evolution for these two cases are also different . before the reverse shock crossing time ,",
    "the polarization evolution in case 4 is more quick than that in case 1 .    in general",
    ", we find that in cases 1 and 4 , i.e. the early afterglow is dominated by the reverse shock , the position angle changes abruptly by @xmath1 at the vicinity of the crossing time ( @xmath236 ) .",
    "furthermore , if the polarization angle changes by @xmath1 twice , or such a change happens before @xmath23 , or the position angle changes gradually , then we can identify that the magnetic field configuration in the ejecta might be aligned .",
    "otherwise , the magnetic field configuration may be toroidal . in cases 2 and 3 ,",
    "i.e. the forward shock dominates the whole emission , no matter what the magnetic field configuration is in the reverse shocked region , the polarization degree is very small and nearly zero for all observing angles before the reverse shock crossing time .",
    "for all the four cases discussed above , at large observing angles ( los outside the jet cone ) , e.g. @xmath215 and @xmath216 , there is a peak in the polarization degree evolution curve at late times ( about @xmath237 s ) in our calculations .",
    "the peak time has a correlation with the observing angle .",
    "the larger the observing angle , the later the peak time . for the toroidal magnetic field configuration in region 3 ,",
    "if the observing angle is zero , because of the symmetry in this magnetic field configuration , the polarization degree is always zero , even the emission is dominated by the reverse shock . the jet break time ( when @xmath238 ) is about @xmath239 s in the thin shell case and about @xmath240 s in the thick shell case in our calculations . when @xmath212 , for the toroidal magnetic field configuration , our results show that the position angle changes abruptly by @xmath1 slightly after jet break time for the four cases .",
    "for the aligned magnetic field configuration , the position angle changes abruptly by @xmath241 slightly after jet break time for the reverse shock dominated cases ( cases 1 and 4 ) .",
    "however , the change of the position angle slightly after the jet break time for the forward shock dominated cases ( cases 2 and 3 ) is very small ( about @xmath242 ) .",
    "the reason is that the reverse shock emission in our calculation also affects the stokes parameter values at late times , even its contribution to the total flux can be neglected .",
    "there have been few early optical afterglows with polarized emission detected in the past decade .",
    "these grb afterglows include grb 060418 with an upper limit @xmath243 during the forward shock dominated phase ( mundell et al .",
    "2007 ) , grb 090102 with an averaged linear polarization @xmath244 during the reverse shock dominated phase ( steele et al . 2009 ) , grb 120308a with an evolving polarization degree and a nearly constant position angle from the reverse shock emission phase to the forward shock emission phase ( mundell et al . 2013 ) .",
    "in this section we apply our models to try to interpret the afterglow observations of grb 120308a .",
    "our fitting results are shown in fig .",
    "11 for a toroidal magnetic field configuration and in fig . 12 for an aligned magnetic field configuration .",
    "both of the magnetic field configurations can fit the observations equally well .",
    "the dynamics parameters we use both for totoidal and aligned magnetic field configurations are : @xmath245 , @xmath246 , @xmath247 , @xmath248 , @xmath249 , @xmath186 .",
    "we also take @xmath204 for both magnetic field configurations .",
    "the other parameters adopted in our fittings are @xmath250 , @xmath251 , @xmath252 , @xmath87 , @xmath188 , @xmath253 , and @xmath254 for the toroidal magnetic field configuration , while @xmath250 , @xmath255 , @xmath256 , @xmath87 , @xmath257 , @xmath258 , @xmath224 , and @xmath259 for the aligned magnetic field configuration .",
    "the redshift of grb 120308a is 2.2 ( mundell et al . 2013 ) .",
    "for the two magnetic field configurations , all the fitting parameters we use are in a reasonable range compared with typical values of grb model parameters . when fitting the light curve and polarization evolution of grb 120308a , for simplicity we just use the mean frequency at the @xmath15-band and do not integrate over the frequency band from 555 nm to 690 nm at which the observations were carried out .",
    "the difference of the polarization degree for the integration over energy band ( 555 - 690 nm ) and single r - band will not exceed 3% .    due to the sparse data and large error bars of the polarization observations , we currently can not distinguish between these two magnetic field configurations for grb 120308a .",
    "long - time observations with high polarization resolution are needed in future to nail down the true magnetic field configuration , especially observations of the polarization degree when the position angle changes abruptly by @xmath1 during the early afterglow phase .",
    "in this paper , we have developed the forward - reverse shock dynamics to calculate the light curve and polarization evolution of early optical afterglows of grbs . as an example , the observed data of grb 120308a have been fitted using our model .",
    "the difference between our dynamics and that of hdl99 is that we take into account the reverse shock process while hdl99 neglected the effect of the reverse shock on the jet hydrodynamical evolution .",
    "our numerical results show that the main difference is before the reverse shock crossing time @xmath23 . at the beginning ,",
    "the reverse shock is very weak .",
    "so the bulk lorentz factor of the shocked region in the two dynamical models show negligible difference . in the following time ,",
    "a non - negligible ( even large ) fraction of the bulk motion of the ejecta goes into the reverse shocked region .",
    "so our bulk lorentz factor of the shocked region is smaller than that of hdl99 at the same observer time . after the reverse shock crosses the ejecta ,",
    "region 3 begins to expand adiabatically .",
    "the work done by region 3 to region 2 makes the bulk lorentz factor of the shocked region decreases slowly .",
    "this is the reason for that our bulk lorentz factor is a bit larger than that of hdl99 after @xmath23 .",
    "the early optical afterglow light curve depends on which shock dominates the emission , the reverse shock or the forward shock .",
    "the hydrodynamics of the reverse shock can be divided into two cases , the thick shell case which corresponds to a relativistic reverse shock , and the thin shell case which corresponds to an initially non - relativistic reverse shock . therefore , there are four situations in total for early optical afterglows , such as the thick - shell reverse shock dominated afterglows ( case 1 ) , the thin - shell forward shock dominated afterglows ( case 2 ) , the thick - shell forward shock dominated afterglows ( case 3 ) , and the thin - shell reverse shock dominated afterglows ( case 4 ) .    while the magnetic field in the forward shock is random magnetic field , in the reverse shocked region , the magnetic field can be large - scale ordered .",
    "this ordered magnetic field is initially in the grb ejecta carried out from the central engine .",
    "magnetic dissipations during the prompt grb phase may reduce the magnetization degree to a low level so that the ejecta is dominated by baryons and leptons in the afterglow phase but the large - scale structure of the magnetic field is remained .",
    "polarization evolution of early afterglows are mainly determined by the detailed magnetic field configurations .",
    "motivated by the main central engine mechanisms , such as magnetar dipole radiation / wind or the blandford - znajek process ( blandford & znajek 1977 ) , we consider two magnetic field configurations , i.e. , toroidal and aligned .",
    "for simplicity , all magnetic fields are assumed to be in the shock plane ( see also toma et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "if the emission is dominated by the forward shock ( cases 2 and 3 ) , the polarization degree is very small for all the observing angles before the reverse shock crossing time . if the emission is dominated by the reverse shock ( cases 1 and 4 ) at early stage , the polarization degree before @xmath23 is @xmath260 and does not change with time in the thick shell case ( case 1 ) , while it increases to a maximal value of @xmath260 at the crossing time in the thin shell case ( case 4 ) .",
    "the above statement does not apply to the case of @xmath261 with a toroidal magnetic field configuration , because the axis - symmetry in this case would lead to totally unpolarized emission . for the four cases discussed in this paper ,",
    "when the observing angle is larger than the half opening angle of the jet , which means that the los locates outside of the jet cone , there will be a peak in the polarization degree evolution at late times ( @xmath222 ) and the peak time has a positive correlation with the observing angle ( as can be seen in the figures for @xmath215 and @xmath216 ) .    for the aligned magnetic field configuration , the position angle in case 4 changes abruptly by @xmath1 twice around ( before and after ) the crossing time @xmath23 for all the observing angles ( except @xmath217 ) .",
    "the position angle in case 1 changes abruptly by @xmath1 once soon after the crossing time , for all the observing angles ( expect @xmath217 ) . when @xmath212 , the position angle changes abruptly by @xmath1 slightly after the jet break time in all of the four cases with the toroidal magnetic field configuration .",
    "for the aligned magnetic field configuration , when @xmath212 , the position angle changes abruptly by @xmath241 slightly after jet break time in cases 1 and 4 . for comparison , in cases 2 and 3 , the change of the position angle slightly after the jet break time is @xmath262 .",
    "these results are generally consistent with that of sari ( 1999 ) .    with polarization observations during some grb",
    "early afterglow phase , we can distinguish between magnetic field configurations for these grbs .",
    "for example , in cases 1 and 4 , the position angle changes abruptly by @xmath1 at the vicinity of the crossing time ( @xmath236 ) .",
    "if such a polarization angle change happens twice , or such a change happens before @xmath23 , or the position angle changes continuously , then we can identify that the magnetic field configuration in the ejecta might be aligned .",
    "otherwise , the magnetic field configuration may be toroidal .",
    "it should be emphasized that if we observe an abrupt @xmath218 change in the position angle with a nonzero polarization degree , then we can infer the magnetic field configuration to be aligned .",
    "otherwise , if we observe an abrupt @xmath218 change in the position angle with a zero polarization degree , then the magnetic field configuration should be toroidal .",
    "the magnetic field configuration is essential for us to understand the grb central engine .",
    "if the field configuration in the ejecta is aligned , the possible central engine is a magnetar .",
    "if the field configuration in the ejecta is toroidal , the probable central engine is a black hole .",
    "we applied our model to the observed data of grb 120308a , and found that both of the magnetic field configurations can fit the data equally well .",
    "the parameters we use for both of the magnetic field configurations are all reasonable compared with other grb modellings .",
    "currently we can not distinguish between the two magnetic field configurations for grb 120308a .",
    "however , future polarization observations with higher quality and more data , especially the polarization degree observations when the position angle changes abruptly by @xmath1 or the observations of the gradual evolution of the position angle , are encouraged to pin down the true magnetic field configuration and provide important clues on the grb central engines .",
    "the early afterglows arising from reverse - forward shocks are commonly observed at optical band .",
    "observations of the early x - ray emission from the external reverse shock are extremely rare , because according to the standard grb afterglow model , the forward shock emission dominates over the reverse shock emission at x - ray band . moreover ,",
    "early x - ray afterglows from the external shocks are usually hidden by the high latitude emission of the prompt grb or the subsequent x - ray flares .",
    "there are a good fraction of grbs observed with the so - called x - ray shallow decay phase or x - ray plateaus , of which the timescale is long enough ( typically lasts for 10 ks ) and the x - ray flux is high enough for the polarization observation .",
    "several scenarios were proposed to interpret these x - ray plateaus , such as the matter - dominated energy injection model and poynting - flux dominated energy injection model for the external plateaus , and the magnetic dissipation model for the internal plateaus .",
    "the latter two predict relatively high linear polarization for x - ray plateaus , while the matter - dominated energy injection model does not .",
    "so polarization observations in the grb x - ray plateaus can be used to constrain these models and a detailed discussion will be presented elsewhere .",
