    "the abundance of massive clusters of galaxies provides sensitive constraints on the cosmological parameters that govern structure growth in the universe .",
    "however , a prerequisite for this is reliable mass measurements for large samples of clusters with well - understood selection criteria .",
    "cluster mass measurements used have traditionally come from virial analysis of the velocity dispersion measurements of cluster galaxies ( e.g. , frenk et al .",
    "1990 ; carlberg et al .  1997 ; borgani et al .  1999 ) , or x - ray temperature measurements of the hot intra - cluster gas under the assumption that the gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "satellite observatories such as rosat , asca , xmm - newton and _ chandra _ have made increasingly accurate x - ray temperature measurements of clusters , and have produced well - defined cluster samples of sufficient size to accurately measure the x - ray temperature and luminosity functions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the relation between cluster mass and x - ray temperature and luminosity , respectively , must be determined to convert these into a reliable cluster mass function .",
    "x - ray luminosities are available for large samples of clusters , but the x - ray luminosity is highly sensitive to the complex physics of cluster cores , making it challenging to relate to cluster mass . measuring x - ray temperatures is observationally much more demanding , but the x - ray temperature is mainly determined by gravitational processes and is hence more directly related to cluster mass than x - ray luminosity . both from simulations and observations",
    "the intrinsic scatter in mass around the mass  temperature relation is thus found to be much smaller ( @xmath7 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) than the scatter in mass around the mass  luminosity relation ( @xmath8 , * ? ? ?",
    "two different routes have been followed for determining the mass  temperature relation .",
    "most studies have used a small sample ( up to about a dozen ) of supposedly well understood clusters for which the assumptions underlying the mass determination should be fulfilled to a high degree .",
    "the main concern for this approach is that the selected clusters may not be representative of the whole cluster population , and therefore the derived mass  temperature relation may only apply to a subset of clusters . alternatively , the mass  temperature relation may be determined from a large sample of more objectively selected clusters .",
    "this is more fruitful when comparing such a locally determined mass  temperature relation to a sample of high - redshift clusters where the data quality does not allow a similar selection of the `` most suitable '' clusters .",
    "also , mass  temperature relations derived from simulations are usually based on a large range of simulated clusters with no pre - selection .",
    "hence it is most appropriate to compare observationally obtained mass  temperature relations determined from all available clusters to the relations from simulations . on the other hand , for some of the clusters in such a sample the hydrostatic assumption may be invalid , making x - ray based mass determinations unreliable for a subset of the clusters . a larger scatter ( which may not be symmetric ) around the mean mass  temperature relation may be expected , when such clusters are included .    there are still poorly understood systematic uncertainties associated with establishing the mass  temperature relation .",
    "the normalization of the mass  temperature relation based on cluster masses determined from x - ray data @xcite , tend to differ significantly between studies , and from the expectations based on numerical simulations ( e.g. , evrard et al .",
    "1996 ; eke et al .",
    "1998 ; pen 1998 ; borgani et al .  2004 ) .",
    "the determination of this normalization is currently the dominating source of discrepancies between the reported values for the power spectrum normalization on the scale of galaxy clusters , @xmath0 , derived from the observed cluster temperature function ( huterer & white 2002 ; seljak 2002 ; pierpaoli et al .",
    "2003 ; henry 2004 ) . observations using x - ray based mass determinations have traditionally favored low normalizations ( and hence low values of @xmath0 ) , while simulations have favored somewhat higher normalizations .",
    "gravitational lensing provides an opportunity to measure cluster masses without invoking the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium in the hot intra - cluster gas implicit in the x - ray based mass determinations .",
    "also , in this case the measurement of cluster mass is truly independent of the x - ray temperature measurement .",
    "hjorth , oukbir & van kampen ( 1998 ) used weak gravitational mass measurements for eight clusters drawn from the literature to find a relation between mass over cluster - centric radius , and temperature .",
    "they determined a normalization of this relation consistent with the value predicted by evrard et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , but with a preference for somewhat higher cluster masses ( if the redshift scaling of equation  [ eq : theorymt ] is assumed , see below ) . however , smith et al .",
    "( 2005 ; hereafter s05 ) determined a mass  temperature relation with a normalization significantly lower than indicated by the hjorth et al .",
    "( 1998 ) study .",
    "s05 based their results on a sample of 10 clusters with weak lensing masses and temperatures determined from _",
    "chandra _ data .    here",
    ", we present a new weak gravitational lensing - based measurement of the normalization of the mass  temperature relation . the main improvements with respect to the work of hjorth et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and s05 is that we use a significantly larger cluster sample which represents a significant fraction of all the clusters in an even larger sample with well - defined objective selection criteria ( dahle et al .  2002 ; h.  dahle 2006 , in preparation ) .",
    "an additional improvement over the work of hjorth et al .",
    "( 1998 ) is that the weak lensing analysis has been performed in a consistent way for all clusters , using the same shear estimator and making the same assumptions about e.g. , the typical redshift of the lensed galaxy population and the degree of contamination by cluster galaxies .",
    "we note that the early data set of clusters with published weak lensing masses used by hjorth et al .",
    "( 1998 ) is biased at some level towards systems that were observed because of `` extreme '' properties , such as being the hottest or most x - ray luminous system known at the time , or having a large number of strongly gravitationally lensed arcs .",
    "furthermore , we note that our gravitational lensing measurements are made at larger radii than probed by s05 , requiring smaller extrapolations to estimate the mass within e.g. , the virial radii of the clusters .    the data set used for the analysis",
    "is described in ",
    "[ sec : data ] , our results for the mass  temperature relation and @xmath0 are presented in   [ sec : results ] , and our results are compared to other work and the implications discussed in   [",
    "sec : discussion ] .    except",
    "when specifically noted otherwise ( for easy comparison to previous results using different cosmologies ) , we assume a spatially  flat cosmology with a cosmological constant ( @xmath5 , @xmath9 ) , and the hubble parameter is given by @xmath10 .",
    "our weak lensing data set is a sample of 30 clusters ( see table  [ tab : dataset ] ) , of which 28 were included in the weak lensing cluster sample of dahle et al .",
    "data for two additional clusters come from a recent extension of this data set ( h. dahle 2006 , in preparation ) .",
    "the clusters targeted for these weak lensing studies were generally selected to lie above an x - ray luminosity limit @xmath11 ergs s@xmath12 ( this luminosity limit is for our chosen cosmology with @xmath13 ) and within a redshift range @xmath14 .",
    "the observed clusters were selected from the x - ray luminous cluster samples of briel & henry ( 1993 ) and ebeling et al .",
    "( 1996;1998;2000 ) .",
    "the cluster samples of the first two of these papers are based on correlating an optically selected cluster sample ( abell 1958 ; abell , corwin , & olowin 1989 ) with x - ray sources from the rosat all - sky survey ( rass ; trmper et al .",
    "1993 ) , while the two last papers contain x - ray flux limited cluster catalogs , also based on rass . of the total sample of 30 clusters , three ( , , and )",
    "are drawn from the briel & henry ( 1993 ) sample and two ( and ) are drawn from the xbac sample of ebeling et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . of the remaining 25 clusters , 22",
    "are included in the x - ray brightest cluster sample ( bcs ) of ebeling et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , while three ( , , and ) come from its low - flux extension ( ebcs ; ebeling et al .",
    "2000 ) . of the bcs and ebcs clusters in our sample ,",
    "24 objects are included in a volume - limited sample of 35 clusters selected from the bcs and ebcs samples ( dahle 2006 ) .",
    "hence , while our sample is not strictly physically well - defined ( in the sense that the availability of an x - ray temperature measurement is one of the defining selection criteria ) , it still has significant overlap with a well - defined cluster sample . in a recent paper ,",
    "stanek et al .  ( 2006 ) discuss how a significant scatter around the mean mass - luminosity relation may cause a significant malmquist bias in x - ray flux - limited cluster samples , causing high - mass , low flux clusters to drop out at high redshifts .",
    "this would result in a bias in the mass - luminosity ( or mass - temperature ) relation derived based on such a sample .",
    "we note , however , that although the rass - based samples from which our cluster sample is drawn are flux - limited , the cluster sample discussed here quite closely approximates a volume - limited sample , and we therefore expect any such bias to be negligible .",
    "the observations were made with the @xmath15 uh8k mosaic ccd camera and the @xmath16 tek ccd camera at the 2.24 m university of hawaii telescope and with the @xmath16 alfosc ccd camera at the 2.56 m nordic optical telescope .",
    "all clusters were imaged in both the @xmath17- and @xmath18-band , with typical total exposure times of 3.5h in each passband for the uh8k data and @xmath19h for the data obtained with the more sensitive @xmath16 detectors .",
    "the seeing was in the range @xmath20 for all the imaging data used for the weak lensing analysis .",
    "the median seeing was 082 in the @xmath17-band and 09 in the @xmath18-band .",
    "this gave typically @xmath21 usable background galaxies per square arcminute , or a `` figure of merit '' value of @xmath22deg@xmath23 , as defined by kaiser ( 2000 ) .",
    "as noted below , the background galaxies were selected based on signal to noise ratio rather than magnitude , with limits corresponding to @xmath24 and @xmath25 for point sources .",
    "the observations and data reduction of the data set used for the weak lensing mass measurements are described in detail by dahle et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "major efforts are being made to improve the methods for the estimation of weak gravitational lensing , particularly in connection with ongoing and future studies of `` cosmic shear '' based on wide - field optical surveys .",
    "the requirements for the precision of shear estimates in these surveys are substantially more stringent than for weak lensing observations of massive clusters , given the significantly weaker lensing effects measured in random fields .    in this work ,",
    "we have used the shear estimator of kaiser ( 2000 ) , which was `` blind - tested '' ( along with several other shear estimators ) by heymans et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , using simulated lensing data .",
    "the shear estimator of kaiser ( 2000 ) is more mathematically rigorous than the currently most widely used shear estimator ( kaiser , squires , & broadhurst 1995 ) , but it displays a significant non - linear response to shear , unlike most other shear estimators . if we correct our shear values using a second order polynomial based on the test results of heymans et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , we find that most cluster masses stay within @xmath26% of the mass calculated based on uncorrected shear values .",
    "furthermore , the change in average cluster mass is @xmath27% , i.e. , there is very little systematic shift in mass . in the end , we chose not to apply this correction , since it would , in a few cases , require extrapolations outside the range of shear values over which the shear estimator has been tested . for more details about the practical implementation of this shear estimator ,",
    "see dahle et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .    to convert the measurements of weak gravitational shear into actual cluster masses , the distances to the background galaxies need to be known .",
    "the background galaxy redshifts were estimated from spectroscopic and photometric redshifts in the hubble deep field ( for details , see dahle et al .",
    "2002 ) . for our data set and chosen cosmological model , the average value of the ratio between the lens - source and observer - source angular diameter distances , @xmath28/@xmath29 , is well approximated by the relation @xmath30 within the redshift range of our cluster sample .",
    "this then provides an effective critical surface density for lensing ( @xmath31 ; where @xmath32 is the angular diameter distance to the cluster ) , which is used for deriving cluster masses from the shear estimates .",
    "the quoted value of @xmath33 corresponds to the value at large cluster radii ; at smaller radii a correction term has to be employed to account for contamination by cluster galaxies , as discussed below and illustrated in figure  [ fig : cluscont ] .",
    "the observable galaxy shape distortions caused by gravitational lensing provide a measurement of the reduced tangential shear , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the tangential component of the shear and @xmath36 is the convergence .",
    "we fit an nfw - type mass density profile ,    @xmath37    ( navarro , frenk , & white 1997 ) , to the observed reduced shear profile @xmath38 of each cluster .",
    "here , @xmath39 is the critical density of the universe at the redshift of the cluster , and    @xmath40    we assumed a concentration parameter @xmath41 , corresponding to the median halo concentration predicted by bullock et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for a @xmath42 cluster from simulations of dark matter halos in a @xmath4cdm universe . here , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is defined as the radius within which the average mass density is 200 times the critical density @xmath46 , and",
    "@xmath47 is the virial radius of the cluster .",
    "the lensing properties of the nfw model have been calculated by bartelmann ( 1996 ) and wright & brainerd ( 2000 ) . from our fit",
    ", we calculated @xmath48 , the mass enclosed by the radius @xmath49 .",
    "the mass estimates are listed in table  [ tab : dataset ] .",
    "the shear measurements used for the fit were made at clustercentric radii @xmath50 for the clusters that were observed with @xmath16 ccd cameras and @xmath51 for the clusters that were observed with the uh8k camera . by comparison , we find @xmath49 values typically in the range @xmath52 for the clusters we study here . in many cases ,",
    "we need to extrapolate the nfw profile out to @xmath49 ( in table  [ tab : dataset ] we list the ratio of the outermost radii of our shear measurements , @xmath53 , to @xmath49 , and note that @xmath54 for our chosen nfw model ) . in this extrapolation , we assume the median nfw concentration parameter given above . hence , any intrinsic scatter in @xmath55 will introduce an extra uncertainty in the cluster mass estimates . if we assume a random scatter around the mean value of @xmath55 at the level ( a @xmath56 @xmath57 ) predicted by bullock et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , we find a corresponding scatter in the mass estimates of 20% for our data set . this additional scatter is not included in the uncertainties of the listed mass measurements in table  [ tab : dataset ] , but is considered further in section  3.2 .",
    "the measured gravitational lensing signal is sensitive to the two - dimensional surface mass distribution , including mass associated with the cluster outside @xmath49 , and random structures seen in projection along the line of sight ( metzler , white & loken 2001 ; hoekstra 2001 ; clowe , de lucia & king 2004 ; de putter & white 2005 ) .",
    "this will introduce additional uncertainty ( and potentially a net bias ) to any lensing - based estimates of the cluster mass contained within a 3d volume .",
    "studies based on simulated clusters ( e.g. , clowe et al .",
    "2004 ) indicate that the net bias is no more than a few percent when 3d cluster masses are estimated by fitting observations of @xmath38 to predictions from theoretical models of the mass distribution , such as the nfw model",
    ". however , the scatter in the mass estimates from projection effects amount to a weak lensing mass dispersion of @xmath58 for massive galaxy clusters , which should be added to the observational uncertainties of the lensing mass estimates . in this paper , we have assumed a lensing mass dispersion of 0.26 resulting from projection effects , corresponding to the value estimated by metzler , white & loken ( 2001 ) from their n - body simulations . although these authors considered a somewhat different mass estimator , more recent estimates indicate a similar mass dispersion for the nfw profile fitting method that we have used .",
    "this additional mass uncertainty has been added in quadrature to the uncertainties of @xmath48 values listed in table  [ tab : dataset ] .",
    "the absence of reliable information about the individual redshifts of the faint galaxies used for the weak lensing measurement will inevitably result in some degree of confusion between lensed background galaxies and unlensed cluster galaxies .",
    "the magnitude of this effect will depend on the projected number density of cluster galaxies , and should thus have a strong dependency on cluster radius .",
    "hence , a radially dependent correction factor was applied to the shear measurements to correct for contamination from cluster galaxies in the faint galaxy catalogs that were used to measure the gravitational shear ( these catalogs included all galaxies in the cluster fields that were detected at a signal - to - noise ratio @xmath59 , with no additional selection based on e.g. , galaxy color ) .",
    "the magnitude of this correction was estimated from the radial dependence of the average faint galaxy density in two `` stacks '' of clusters observed with the uh8k camera , one at @xmath60 and the other at @xmath61 , assuming that the contamination is negligible at the edge of the uh8k fields , @xmath62 mpc from the cluster center .",
    "the estimated degree of contamination is shown in figure  [ fig : cluscont ] .    given the difference in cluster redshift , the similarity of the two curves in figure  [ fig : cluscont ] may be somewhat surprising , as one would naively expect the more distant clusters to display a significantly lower surface density of cluster galaxies .",
    "however , there are several competing effects that affect the observed galaxy density at a fixed angular radius : firstly , if all cluster galaxies were detectable regardless of cluster redshift , the change in apparent image scale with redshift should increase the surface density by a factor given by the square of the ratio of the angular diameter distances . on the other hand , a fixed angular radius would correspond to a larger physical cluster - centric radius ( and hence lower galaxy density in physical units ) at the larger redshift , the difference depending on the slope of the radial galaxy density profile . at the radii probed in this study ,",
    "both the radial surface mass density profile and the number density profile of bright cluster galaxies follow approximately the power law behavior of a singular isothermal sphere ( @xmath63 , with @xmath64 ) .",
    "hence , the physical number density ( in galaxies / mpc@xmath65 ) at a fixed angular radius should decrease as the inverse of the ratio of angular diameter distances .",
    "in addition , the faintest galaxies drop below the detection limit at higher redshift , the effect depending on the slope of the cluster luminosity function around @xmath66 . assuming a schechter ( 1976 ) luminosity function with a faint - end slope @xmath67 ( typical of rich clusters ) and @xmath68 , the luminosity function can be integrated down to the detection limit ( corresponding to @xmath69 and @xmath70 at @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively ) , to estimate the fraction of cluster galaxies that drop out at the higher redshift ( @xmath73% ) .",
    "finally , a redshift - dependence given by @xmath74 was assumed to account for galaxy evolution in the clusters .",
    "the combination of all these effects would predict a surface density of cluster galaxies which is 7% less at @xmath75 , compared to @xmath71 , for a fixed cluster richness .",
    "even this small difference would be erased by a slight decrease in the assumed values of the slopes @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "a faint - end slope of the luminosity function of @xmath78 would be sufficient to remove the predicted difference in galaxy surface density at the two different redshifts .",
    "based on _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) wfpc2 imaging of the galaxy cluster ( which is similar to the clusters studied here in terms of optical richness , lensing mass and x - ray properties ) , pracy et al .",
    "( 2004 ) find that the cluster core shows a relative depletion of dwarf galaxies , leading to a radial profile of faint galaxies which is significantly shallower than the sis prediction .",
    "for the `` intermediate '' dwarf population ( @xmath79 , similar to the range in absolute magnitude of cluster galaxies in our faint galaxy catalogs ) , these authors find a radial distribution with a slope @xmath80 . assuming a similar slope for",
    "the radial distribution of the faint cluster galaxies in our catalogs would also remove the predicted difference between the two curves in figure  [ fig : cluscont ] . based on this figure , and the above discussion",
    ", we conclude that we are probably justified in ignoring the redshift - dependence in our cluster galaxy contamination correction .",
    "the level of cluster galaxy contamination for individual clusters will generally differ from the mean level calculated above , as there will be significant cluster - to - cluster variations in the abundances of cluster dwarf galaxies .",
    "based on the sample of clusters observed with the uh8k camera , the scatter in dwarf galaxy richness was estimated to be @xmath81 ( this estimate also includes variations in the field galaxy density caused by uncorrelated large - scale structures along the line of sight , and hence the true scatter in dwarf galaxy richness of the clusters is somewhat overestimated ) . by employing the mean contamination correction calculated above rather than an estimate appropriate for each cluster ,",
    "we introduce an additional scatter of up to @xmath82 in our mass estimates .",
    "this additional scatter is not included in the uncertainties of the tabulated mass measurements in table  [ tab : dataset ] , but is considered further in section  3.2 .",
    "eight of the clusters in our sample were also included in the combined strong and weak gravitational lensing study of s05 , based on observations of a sample of 10 x - ray luminous galaxy clusters at @xmath83 using hst wfpc2 .",
    "these authors estimated the projected cluster mass within a clustercentric radius of @xmath84 kpc , assuming an einstein - de sitter ( @xmath85 , @xmath86 ) cosmology .",
    "figure  [ fig : s05comp ] shows a comparison of the mass values listed by s05 with our cluster mass estimates , using the best - fit nfw model to derive projected cluster masses , assuming the same cosmology as s05 .",
    "these authors assumed a spatially constant contamination of 20% cluster galaxies in their background galaxy catalogs at radii @xmath87 , while we find an average contamination of 30% for our data at these radii .",
    "hence , for the plot in figure  [ fig : s05comp ] we have adjusted our radially dependent contamination correction such that the average contamination at small radii is consistent with that assumed by s05 .",
    "we find that our cluster mass estimates are generally consistent with those of s05 , although with a tendency for higher masses ( by about 30% ) .",
    "for clusters in the weak lensing data set , we compiled a list of corresponding x - ray temperatures from the literature . for many of these clusters , their global temperature , or even a temperature map , has been determined using data from _ chandra _ and/or xmm - newton .",
    "however , these temperatures constitute a rather heterogeneous sample , for which the systematics are not well established .",
    "consequently , x - ray temperatures were primarily drawn from the samples of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , each providing a homogeneous measure of the global cluster temperature ( i.e. , temperature measured within a cluster - centric distance close to @xmath49 ) for a large fraction of the clusters in the weak lensing sample .",
    "all these authors derived temperatures based on analysis of asca spectra . for two clusters not in either of the samples mentioned above",
    "we extracted published temperatures from other sources .",
    "specifically , from the works of @xcite and @xcite we extracted temperatures estimated by these authors by fitting an isothermal plasma model with the galactic absorbing column density as a free parameter .",
    "the temperatures taken from @xcite were derived by fitting an isothermal plasma model with the nominal galactic absorbing column density fixed , but since only energies above 1  kev are used in the @xcite spectral fitting the fixed column density should not introduce systematic effects relative to the temperatures from the @xcite and the @xcite samples . for the remaining two clusters we extracted",
    "published temperatures obtained in a similar way ( see table  [ tab : dataset ] ) .",
    "for the clusters in two or more samples , their derived temperatures agree within the uncertainties , and for any cluster the derived temperatures differ by less than 20% between samples . also , the mean of temperature differences between any two of the samples by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite is less than 3% , indicating the low level of systematic temperature variance between different analyses .",
    "although the isothermal plasma model has proven too simplistic for nearby clusters , the global cluster temperature is straightforward to derive from observations as well as simulations , enabling a rather direct comparison between observations and theory .",
    "furthermore , for the majority of distant ( @xmath88 ) clusters only global isothermal temperatures can be obtained in the foreseeable future .",
    "hence , we refrain from going into the detailed spatial and spectral modeling of the intra - cluster gas .",

    "hence , mass  temperature relations were obtained by fitting the data in table  [ tab : dataset ] using the bces(@xmath182 ) estimator of @xcite to the following parameterization of the mass  temperature relation    @xmath183    the redshift - dependent factor , @xmath184 , contained in eq.[eq : fittedmtrelation ] must be calculated individually for each cluster , as this would otherwise produce an artificial 15% variation in mass over the redshift range spanned by our cluster sample . in effect , the normalization of the relation refers to the present epoch ( @xmath185 ) .",
    "the fitting procedure of @xcite takes uncertainties in temperatures as well as in weak lensing masses into account , and makes no assumptions about the intrinsic scatter of both quantities .",
    "results from fitting sub - samples as well as the full sample are presented in table  [ tab : tstar ] and figure  [ fig : mtrel ] .    for the full data set ( for those clusters with temperature from more than one sample the temperature was taken in prioritized order from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) we find the following normalization of the mass  temperature relation at 8 kev @xmath186 and a slope of @xmath187 .",
    "it is evident that the slope of the mass  temperature relation is not well - determined since our data only span a modest range at the high mass / high temperature end of the cluster distribution . in fact , it is not obvious that there is a tight mass  temperature relation at the high temperature end probed here .      the concentration of clusters around @xmath188  kev enables a robust measurement of the normalization of the mass  temperature relation at the high  mass end . even though the slope of the mass  temperature relation varies substantially between the three x - ray sub - samples @xcite the best fit normalizations agree within their statistical uncertainty .",
    "we note that for all fits , the four different regressions of @xcite all result in normalizations within 20% .",
    "the strongest constraints on the mass  temperature relation normalization are obtained by taking advantage of previous studies of massive clusters @xcite , showing that the mass  temperature relation slope is close to @xmath2 as expected from simple gravitational collapse models @xcite .",
    "hence , in order to express the normalization of the mass  temperature relation in terms of the characteristic temperature @xmath189 @xcite we assume @xmath181 ( with a representative uncertainty of 10% , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "as is custom for quoting @xmath190 values we adopt the redshift dependence factor @xmath191^{-3/2}$ ] @xcite where @xmath192 is the mean overdensity inside the virial radius in units of the critical density at the relevant redshift ( @xmath193 and @xmath184 differs by 7% at @xmath71 ) .",
    "we find @xmath194 for our full sample and results from calculations of @xmath190 based on various subsamples are listed in table  [ tab : tstar2 ] . from the @xmath0 - @xmath190 relation plotted by @xcite in their figure 2 , we find @xmath195 , based on our full sample .",
    "we note that this relation is valid only for an intrinsic scatter in temperature of @xmath196 around the mean mass  temperature relation .",
    "a larger intrinsic scatter will imply a lower value of @xmath0 .",
    "we provide our constraints on the intrinsic scatter below .",
    "the squared scatter in lensing mass , @xmath48 , around the best fit , @xmath197 , is the sum of the squared measurement error , the squared intrinsic scatter , and the squared systematic errors @xmath198 .",
    "the main systematic errors in the lensing mass ( see section  2.1 ) arise from extrapolating the assumed nfw mass profile out to @xmath49 ( due to cluster - to - cluster variations in the assumed concentration parameter @xmath199 ) and from the separation of cluster / background galaxies ( due to cluster - to - cluster richness variations ) .",
    "each of these introduces a scatter of 20% in the lensing mass , hence @xmath200 . for the full sample",
    "we find @xmath201 which is larger than expected from the mean lensing mass error , @xmath202 and the systematic errors , indicating either a sizable intrinsic scatter in mass or that the measurement / systematic errors are severely under - estimated .",
    "accounting for errors in both mass and temperature , we find an intrinsic scatter in @xmath190 of @xmath203 .",
    "there is a 70% probability that the scatter in temperature is larger than 10% , favoring somewhat lower values of @xmath0 than quoted above .",
    "however , most of the scatter is caused by the low mass clusters .",
    "we looked into whether relaxed clusters and non - relaxed clusters have the same normalization of the mass  temperature relation .",

    "the relaxed clusters we find a normalization of the mass  temperature relation of @xmath204 while the normalization for the non - relaxed clusters is @xmath205 ( see figure  [ fig : relax ] ) .",
    "the higher normalization of relaxed clusters is supported by the fact that the mean mass of relaxed clusters is a factor @xmath206 larger than the mean mass of `` non - relaxed '' clusters , although the relaxed and the non - relaxed clusters span roughly the same temperature range .",
    "the scatter in mass for the relaxed sample ( @xmath207 ) is similar to the scatter for the non - relaxed sample ( @xmath208 ) .",
    "the mean error for both samples is @xmath209 .",
    "either relaxed clusters spread as much around their mass  temperature relation as clusters in general , or we have used a poor definition of `` relaxed '' clusters . however , the fact that the normalization of the mass  temperature relation for relaxed clusters is higher than for non - relaxed clusters indicates that there is a physical difference between the two sub - samples . from the present study",
    ", it thus seems that relaxed clusters do not form a tighter mass  temperature relation than clusters in general .    for a given mass ,",
    "non - relaxed clusters are found to be @xmath210% hotter than relaxed clusters .",
    "since we consider global , isothermal temperatures , the presence of `` cooling cores '' in relaxed clusters will result in a lower global temperature than the virial temperature .",
    "however , this effect is at the 10%-20% level ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) so this can not alone explain the temperature difference between relaxed and non - relaxed clusters .",
    "based on the mass  temperature relation from 10 clusters ( 3 of which are considered relaxed ) , s05 also find that non - relaxed clusters are hotter than relaxed clusters .",

    "our determination of @xmath239 is higher than most @xmath0 determinations from cluster data ( for a compilation of these , see e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "however , the more recent 3-year wmap results ( spergel et al .  2006 ) give a significantly lower value of @xmath0 , and also a preference for a value of @xmath245 lower than 0.3 .",
    "also , results from the recent 100 square degree weak lensing survey ( benjamin et al .  2007 ) favor a lower value of @xmath246 for @xmath5 .",

    "secondly , more accurate weak lensing - based mass measurements of a larger sample of clusters are feasible as large mosaic ccd cameras that can probe intermediate - redshift clusters beyond their virial radii are now common , and the cluster sample could easily be doubled from a similar survey in the southern celestial hemisphere .",

    "this makes it feasible to calculate the cluster mass function directly from the lensing masses , rather than indirectly via the x - ray temperature function ( dahle 2006 ) . since mass estimates based on baryonic tracers of the total cluster mass only enters indirectly as a selection criterion ( e.g. , clusters selected based on x - ray luminosity above a certain threshold ) , the method is less susceptible to systematic and random errors , as it does not require an accurate characterization of the scatter around the mean mass  temperature relation .",
