    "the neutral hydrogen bounded by dark matter halos at high redshift has detectable extended ly@xmath3 `` fuzz '' powered by photoionization from central quasars ( haiman & rees 2001 ) .",
    "the detection of this signal may impose strong constraints on quasar formation during galaxy assembly .",
    "the lifetime of quasars remains uncertain , but they are generally thought to be short - lived , with estimated ages of @xmath6 to @xmath7 years ( jakobsen et al .",
    "2003 ; martini & schneider 2003 ) . detecting the infalling gas , heated by the quasar , as ly@xmath3 fuzz can help to constrain the quasar s lifetime . if undetected",
    ", it may imply that quasar activity only appears when the gas has settled into a thin disk or has already been consumed mostly by star formation .",
    "the preliminary evidence for extended ly@xmath3 emission in radio - quiet quasars already suggests that quasar activity influences galaxy assembly ( bergeron et al .",
    "1999 ; fardal et al . 2001 ; bunker et al .",
    "the spectrum of the quasar q1205@xmath830 unambiguously shows an extended hydrogen ly@xmath3 glow formed by gas falling into the ionizing cone of the quasar ( weidinger et al . 2004 ) .    what is the physical appearance of a quasar turning _ off _  within an assembling galaxy",
    "this letter investigates the afterglow properties of ultraluminous , radio - quiet quasars .",
    "while the quasar is active , it provides a source of energy to heat infalling material ( binney & tabor 1995 ; ciotti & ostriker 2001 ; brighenti & mathews 2002 ) . hot gas in elliptical galaxies has been extensively studied for three decades since _ einstein _ , but the physics of its origin and evolution still are not completely understood ( see the review by mathews & brighenti 2003 ) .",
    "it has been realized that gas infalling into the dark matter halo of a nascent galaxy ( fall & rees 1985 ) undergoes thermal instability and forms a two - phase medium that would exhibit very faint emission features ( haiman , spaans & quataert 2000 ) . in this stage",
    ", pressure balance holds between the cold ( @xmath9 k ) and hot ( @xmath10 k ) medium .",
    "the clumping factor of the two - phase medium is @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the baryon number density .",
    "the irradiation by the quasar light greatly changes the two - phase structure of the infalling gas .",
    "we assume the abundance of hydrogen , helium and iron to be @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively . the thermal state of the photoionized gas is determined by the ionization parameter , defined by @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the number density and temperature of the gas and @xmath19 is the flux of the ionizing source ( krolik , mckee & tarter 1981 ) . compton heating and cooling balance at a temperature of @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the mean energy of the ionizing source and @xmath22 is boltzmann s constant . for a typical quasar spectrum ( elvis et al . 1994 ) ,",
    "the mean photon energy is @xmath23 kev .",
    "the gas will be heated to @xmath24 k ( see the detailed calculation of sazonov et al .",
    "2004 ) , which is one order of magnitude hotter than the typical virial temperature of 0.15 kev for the hot gas ( fall & rees 1985 ) . when the ionization parameter of the ionized gas reaches @xmath25 where @xmath26 , the gas will be fully heated to the compton temperature ( krolik , mckee & tarter 1981 ) .",
    "the timescale of compton heating is given by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the electron mass and @xmath29 is the thomson scattering cross section .",
    "this timescale is derived by dividing the number of scatterings needed to reach the compton temperature by the scattering rate .",
    "we assume a quasar lifetime of @xmath30 , with @xmath31 yr being the salpeter timescale ( salpeter 1964 ) . setting @xmath32 , with @xmath33 , we have the compton radius @xmath34 which , along with the condition @xmath35 , gives the compton density @xmath36    0.2 cm [ fig1 ] 0.5 cm the compton radius depicts the size of the region in which the gas is heated by the quasar to the compton temperature during the timescale @xmath37 .",
    "the compton density is the maximum density allowed within @xmath38 by compton heating during the lifetime of the quasar .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath39 is independent of the quasar luminosity . beyond @xmath38 ,",
    "the gas has an ionization parameter of @xmath40 and hence is in a two - phase state . for a medium with a density lower than @xmath39 , the size of the region with @xmath41 extends beyond @xmath38 .",
    "however , in such a case compton heating is sufficiently inefficient that the gas is in a time - dependent two - phase state .",
    "we do not consider this regime for ultraluminous quasars .",
    "the radius of the strmgren sphere of fe@xmath0 ions is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 is the fe@xmath0 recombination coefficient in seaton ( 1959 ) evaluated at @xmath45 k , and @xmath46 is the volume - averaged mean square density of the cold gas . the rate of ionizing photons , @xmath47 , is estimated from the typical spectrum of quasars ( elvis et al . 1994 ) . the radius of the he@xmath1 strmgren sphere @xmath48 , and @xmath49 ; we assume ionization energies of @xmath50 ev and @xmath51 ev and an ionizing spectrum @xmath52 . the radius of the ionized region is given by ( cen & haiman 2000 ) @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .",
    "as the ionizing luminosity increases , the compton radius extends to the radius of the helium strmgren sphere .",
    "the entire strmgren sphere will be fully heated to the compton temperature when @xmath55 , at which point the iron compton - limit luminosity @xmath56 and the iron compton - limit radius @xmath57    0.2 cm [ fig2 ] 0.2 cm when @xmath58 , the compton sphere is smaller than the strmgren sphere .",
    "since the medium in the region between the strmgren radius and the compton radius can not fully reach the compton temperature , the features of the afterglow arising from it could be complicated .",
    "we are currently interested in the case of @xmath59 , namely , the ultraluminous quasars .    the energy stored within the compton sphere , @xmath60 erg , where @xmath61 k , @xmath62 @xmath63 , and @xmath64 kpc , is only a small fraction ( @xmath65 ) of the total energy released ( @xmath66 erg ) during the activity of a quasar with a black hole mass of @xmath67 and an accretion efficiency of 0.1 .",
    "the recombination timescale is @xmath68 yr . for quasars surrounded by a very dilute medium , this timescale is too long for the ions to recombine within the hubble time at the relevant epoch .",
    "the strmgren radius is then never reached , and the hot gas would emit no recombination lines . this situation might be relevant for some isolated , exceptionally gas - poor elliptical galaxies .",
    "if the recombination timescale is longer than the lifetime of quasars , the discussion on the strmgren radius is also inapplicable .",
    "an afterglow will be seen from the compton sphere after the quasar is extinct . here",
    "we estimate the expected signature of the quasar afterglow from the hot gas inside the compton sphere that is in hydrostatic equilibrium with the gravitational potential of the dark matter halo ( fig .",
    "the isothermal density profile of the hot gas is given by ( makino et al .",
    "1998 ) @xmath69 , where @xmath70 , @xmath71 , the characteristic radius @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",
    "we use a concentration parameter of @xmath75 and @xmath76 for the dark matter halo .",
    "the gas mass fraction is only @xmath77 of that of the dark matter halo , where @xmath78 is the thomson scattering depth of the hot gas .",
    "we note that the density of the hot gas is lower than the compton density .",
    "the cooling timescale of the fully ionized gas inside the compton sphere is governed mainly by free - free radiation .",
    "0.2 cm [ fig3 ] 0.2 cm the cooling timescale at the center of the halo is @xmath79 yr , and it will be considerably longer in the outskirts .",
    "this leads to the appearance of a long - lived , extended x - ray  emitting envelope , characterized by a luminosity @xmath80 for @xmath81 k , @xmath64 kpc and the above density profile , peaking at an energy of a few kev . since the degree of ionization is very high during the active phase of the quasar , we assume that iron is fully ionized .",
    "figure 2 shows the predicted x - ray signature from such a model , where we have computed the integrated emission from the compton sphere of a progenitor quasar shining at a fiducial compton luminosity of @xmath82 , including contributions from the @xmath83 and @xmath84 edges of fe@xmath0 free - bound emission from hydrogen - like ions ( seaton 1959 ) as well as the ly@xmath3 and ly@xmath4 lines from fe@xmath0 . for redshifts @xmath85 , the expected flux of @xmath86 will be detectable by _",
    "chandra_/acis with an exposure time of 100 ks , and the angular radius of the compton sphere , @xmath87 , should be resolvable . however , the effective area of acis ( @xmath88 above a few kev ) is too small to be able to detect the ly@xmath3 and ly@xmath4 lines of fe@xmath0 .",
    "the future _ xeus _ mission , with an expected angular resolution of @xmath89 at a flux level of @xmath90 in the energy range @xmath91 kev , will be able to detect the compton sphere and ly@xmath3 and ly@xmath4 emission at redshifts lower than 1 .",
    "higher - redshift afterglows are too faint to be detected by _",
    "chandra _ , whereas _ xeus _ will have insufficient resolution .",
    "lastly , we consider the signal from the region between the compton radius and the ionization radius ( fig .",
    "1 ) , which arises from hydrogen and helium photoionized by the quasar . after the quasar quenches , the photoionized gas will radiate recombination lines of hydrogen and helium .",
    "we calculate the fluxes of hydrogen ly@xmath3 and he  ii @xmath921640 , 4686 , using the recombination coefficients in seaton ( 1978 ) , by integrating the shell between the compton and ionization radius ( fig .",
    "the broadening width of the recombination lines due to thermal motions , @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the charge of the ions .",
    "this width can be readily resolved by ground - based optical telescopes , the largest of which should also have the requisite sensitivity and spatial resolution to image the line - emitting region . we note that the emission - line regions considered here are different from the extended ly@xmath3 nebulae discovered in some star - forming galaxies ( steidel et al .",
    "the latter are powered by ob stars , which are not energetic enough to ionize he .",
    "if quasar afterglows can be detected , either the luminosity or the size of the compton sphere ( equations 6 and 7 ) can be used to estimate @xmath95 , the lifetime of the progenitor quasar . in practice",
    ", the luminosity would be much better constrained than the size , as the latter would be only marginally resolved even with _",
    "chandra _ and depends critically on the detailed surface brightness distribution . while the hot gas normally associated with individual elliptical galaxies ( osullivan et al .",
    "2003 ) rarely has temperatures exceeding 1  kev , galaxies situated in groups or denser environments would be surrounded by hotter gas , which at large distances would be difficult to distinguish from any component intrinsic to an afterglow . to minimize this source of confusion ,",
    "the local environment of any potential targets needs to be carefully scrutinized . with typical x - ray temperatures of a few kev , x - ray binaries present another possible source of contamination , but",
    "their integrated x - ray emission ( fabbiano 1989 ) , even in large galaxies , is significantly less than @xmath82 .",
    "if quasars shine near the eddington limit , the compton - limit luminosity corresponds to a black hole mass @xmath96 .",
    "if such massive black holes are common among quasars ( netzer 2003 ; vestergaard 2004 ) , their afterglows should not be difficult to detect . from the @xmath97 relation ( tremaine et al .",
    "2002 ) , we expect the host galaxies to have stellar velocity dispersions of @xmath98 . thus , future searches of quasar afterglows should target the most massive giant ellipticals .",
    "such galaxies are rare , but not exceedingly so . from the local velocity dispersion function of early - type galaxies ( sheth et al .",
    "2003 ) , the space density of galaxies with @xmath99 is @xmath100 mpc@xmath101 .    for the more abundant but less powerful quasars , with luminosities below the compton - limit luminosity , the compton radius can not match the strmgren radius and it will be significantly smaller than the compton - limit radius .",
    "the medium in the transition zone between the compton and strmgren radii is in a time - dependent two - phase state , since it is not able to reach an equilibrium state within the lifetime of the quasar .",
    "we speculate that these lower - luminosity sources would have optical and ultraviolet emission features quite similar to those of ultraluminous quasars , but that the x - ray spectrum should be dominated by the ly@xmath3 and ly@xmath4 lines of lighter ions , such as ne  x or o  viii .",
    "detailed calculations for this case are in progress .",
    "in conclusion , we show that the afterglows of ultraluminous quasars form relic compton spheres that could be detected by _",
    "chandra _ , _ xeus _ , and ground - based optical telescopes .",
    "the luminosities and sizes of the afterglows can be used to estimate the lifetime of quasars , a key constraint on quasar and galaxy evolution .",
    "the extended x - ray envelope recently detected around the isolated elliptical galaxy ngc 4555 ( osullivan & ponman 2004 ) could be an example of the afterglows discussed in the present paper .",
    "it would be worthwhile to search in this object for the predicted extended emission from hydrogen and helium recombination lines .",
