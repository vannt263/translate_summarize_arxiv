    "integral equation theory of liquids ( ietl ) is an effective method for the prediction of the structural and thermodynamic parameters of liquid and amorphous matter @xcite .",
    "ietl describes the stucture of the liquid by using the correlation functions .",
    "the main equation of ietl is the ornstein - zernike ( oz ) equation which for the case of molecular liquids connects the correlation functions of six independent variables @xcite . because of the comutational complexity solving the oz equation in a general case is still an open task . in practice",
    "one uses approximate models , such as the reference interaction site model ( rism ) @xcite and three - dimensional reference interaction site model ( 3drism ) @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the rism equation as the implicit solvent model gives more physically - correct description of the system in comparison to the continuum electrostatics models @xcite .",
    "the important application of the rism equations is the calculation of the solvation free energy ( sfe ) of compounds . within the framework of the proposed model solvation free energy can be analytically calculated from the solutions of the rism equations @xcite .",
    "recently there were proposed several parameterization methods of the results of the rism calculations which predict the solvation free energy with the accuracy of 1 kcal / mol @xcite . however , despite the good results rism still describes not enough accurately the molecular solvent , which leads to the numerous corrections needed for achieving the desired accuracy of the calculations .",
    "the 3drism equations describe more accurately e the stucture of the molecule and , as it was shown , they need essentially less corrections for accurate calculation of the thermodynamic parameters @xcite .",
    "direct picard iteration method is the standard algorithm for solving the equations of the ietl @xcite . although it is easy to implement , but it has quite a low convergence rate .",
    "there were proposed several alternative schemes which increase the convergence rate @xcite .",
    "another way to speed up the calculations is to use the multi - scale methods @xcite .",
    "it is necessary to note that although most of the multi - scale methods use several grids , not all of them do it effictively .",
    "however , the multi - grid technology allows to use all the advantages of the multi - scale approach @xcite .",
    "it was recently shown that the multi - grid allows to increase performance of the rism calculations up to the several dozen times@xcite . in the current paper the multi - grid algorithm which solves the 3drism equations is described .",
    "the optimal discretization parameters for the solvation free energy calculations are found .",
    "the benchmarking of the algorithm and the comparison to the standard picard iteration method is perfromed .",
    "in the paper the 3drism for the description of the infinitely diluted solutions is used .",
    "the solvent molecules are given in the rism approximation , while the solute molecule is a three - dimensional object .",
    "the solvent structure is described by the total and direct correlation functions of the solvent site @xmath1 : @xmath2 , @xmath3 .",
    "3drism equations are written as following : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the number of solvent sites , @xmath6 is the solvent susceptibility function .",

    "we use two values to define the grid : _ spacing _ and _ buffer_. the spacing is the distance between the grid points , and the buffer is the minimal distance from the solute atoms to the grid boundaries ( see figure [ fig : grid ] )     the spacing is the distance between the grid points , and the buffer is the minimal distance from the solute atoms to the grid boundaries , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we use the notations @xmath30 $ ] , @xmath31 $ ] for the forward and inverse discrete fourier transforms on the grid @xmath32 .",
