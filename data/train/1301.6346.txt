    "radio pulsars in compact , highly - relativistic binary systems , such as double neutron star systems ( dns ) and pulsar white dwarf systems ( ns - wd ) , provide the most precise tests of einstein s theory of general relativity ( gr ) and alternative theories of gravity in the strong - field regime ( e.g. @xcite  1989 , @xcite  2006 , @xcite  2008 , @xcite  2012 ) . future more stringent tests of gravity could be performed with more compact and/or higher - mass systems such as pulsar - black hole binary systems ( ns - bh ) ( @xcite  2004 ) , or even pulsars orbiting closely around the super massive black hole at the centre of the galaxy , sgr  a@xmath0 ( @xcite  2005 , @xcite  2012 ) .",
    "the increased orbital velocities and deeper gravitational potentials present in such systems would result in larger post - keplerian ( pk ) orbital effects , which are measurable through pulsar timing ( @xcite  1998 , @xcite  1999 ) .",
    "searches for these highly - prized systems are notoriously difficult . after correction for the frequency",
    "dependent dispersion in the arrival time of pulses , caused by the unknown free electron content along the line - of - sight ( ` dedispersion ' ) , standard pulsar searches look for significant features in the fluctuation spectrum of the dedispersed time series ( see , for example , @xcite  2005 , for a detailed description of pulsar search methods ) . in relativistic binary systems ,",
    "doppler smearing of the pulse frequency , caused by rapid orbital motion during the survey observation , renders standard fourier - based pulsar search algorithms ineffective ( see , e.g. @xcite  1991 ) .",
    "the binary search algorithms that compensate for these effects are computationally expensive in blind pulsar searches .",
    "hence , the analysis of large - scale pulsar surveys , like the parkes multi - beam pulsar survey ( pmps ) , have not yet been performed with optimum binary searches ( @xcite  2004 ) . in this work",
    "we have attempted to further combat binary selection effects in the parkes multi - beam pulsar survey by re - processing the entire survey with an efficient ` coherent acceleration search ' .",
    "the outline of the rest of this paper is as follows : in section 2 , we give a summary of the pmps and describe previous binary searches of the survey data .",
    "section 3 is a description of the binary search algorithm employed in this search . in section 4 , details of the re - processing data pipeline",
    "are given .",
    "section 5 presents timing solutions of all 16 pulsars and further details on any of the notable discoveries .",
    "section 6 provides a discussion of possible reasons for the lack of discoveries of any new relativistic binaries in addition to further tests of the acceleration algorithm presented here .",
    "section 7 is a summary and a discussion of future work on searches for relativistic binary pulsars .",
    "the pmps is the most successful pulsar survey ever completed , having discovered 770 pulsars up to the start of this work ( @xcite  2001 , @xcite  2002 , @xcite  2003 , @xcite  2004 , @xcite  2004 , @xcite  2006 , @xcite  2009 ) and over 30 pulsars discovered by their single pulses ( @xcite  2006 , @xcite  2010 , @xcite  2011 ) . the survey was carried out between 1997 and 2003 using a 13-beam receiver with a bandwidth of 288 mhz centred on 1374 mhz and deployed on the 64-m parkes radio telescope in australia .",
    "it covers a strip along the galactic plane from @xmath1 to @xmath2 and @xmath3 with time series of 35 minutes digitally sampled every @xmath4 .",
    "full details of the survey can be found in @xcite  ( 2001 ) .      despite the early successes of the pmps the number of compact binary pulsars ( orbital period , @xmath5 day ) and millisecond pulsars ( spin period , @xmath6 ms ) discovered was low ; one and three",
    "respectively ( table  3.2 , @xcite  2004 ) .",
    "the long integration time of 35 minutes gave the pmps unprecedented sensitivity to long - period pulsars , although , in searches for relativistic binary pulsars , where the spin frequency can change over the duration of the observation , sensitivity was lost in standard fourier periodicity searches due to smearing of the spectral features of the pulsar .",
    "after an improvement in computational resources at the jodrell bank observatory , in the form of the cobra 182-node beowulf cluster , a full re - processing of the pmps was performed using two search algorithms designed to address the previously - described binary selection effects ( @xcite  2004 , @xcite  2004 ) .",
    "the algorithms used in this analysis were the ` stack - slide search ' ( see , for example , @xcite  1991 ) and the ` phase modulation search ' ( @xcite  2003 ) . in the stack - slide search technique",
    "each dedispersed time series is split into a number of contiguous segments ( 16 in the case of the pmps re - processing ) , which are fourier transformed separately .",
    "the resulting fluctuation spectra are then summed together with different linear offsets to correct for linear drift in pulse frequency caused by any constant line - of - sight acceleration .",
    "so called ` acceleration searches ' have been shown to be valid for observations where the integration time , @xmath7 , is @xmath8 ( @xcite  2003 ) . for the pmps this corresponded to binary systems with @xmath9 hr .",
    "the phase modulation search works by detecting `` periodic sidebands '' in the fluctuation spectrum ; the common marker of a pulsar in a binary system ( @xcite  2003 ) .",
    "pulsars in binary systems where at least @xmath10 orbits are completed during the observation time can be detected with this technique .",
    "for the pmps this corresponded to systems with @xmath11 hr .",
    "the @xcite  ( 2004 ) reprocessing found 11 binary pulsars including the double neutron star system , psr j1756@xmath122251 , that would not have been discovered without the stack - slide search ( @xcite  2005 ) . of the other 10 binary systems ,",
    "three were detected with higher significance because of the stack - slide search ( on average by a factor of @xmath13 : table 7.2 , @xcite  2004 ) .",
    "results from the phase modulation search have never been fully inspected due to difficulties in reconstructing the predicted orbit of pulsar candidates ( faulkner , private communication ) .    although the stack - slide search method improved sensitivity to pulsars in some fast binary systems , sensitivity was lost due to the incoherent summation of spectra . by splitting the time series into a number of segments , each of which is fourier transformed and then summed , the phase coherence of any real signal is not preserved throughout the entire length of the observation . in the presence of gaussian noise , and assuming stacks of equal length , the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of a real signal increases @xmath14n$ ] where @xmath15 is the number of spectra stacked ( @xcite  2000 ) .",
    "as already noted , the stack - slide and phase modulation searches left a gap in sensitivity for pulsars in binary systems with @xmath16 between @xmath17 and @xmath18 hr . for systems that lie in this region of parameter space , sensitivity might also have been lost because of observed changes in acceleration ( ` jerk ' ) that the linear offsets applied in the stack - slide search can not compensate for .",
    "both the orbital - period sensitivity gap and the reduction in sensitivity due to the incoherent nature of the stack search might have been critical in the detection of a relativistic binary pulsar that was near the detection threshold of the survey . in this work",
    "we describe further efforts to tackle binary selection effects in the pmps .",
    "it is possible to perform acceleration searches in the time domain that are fully coherent and without the loss of sensitivity encountered in stacking algorithms .",
    "one such technique is ` time domain resampling ' ; a method that enabled the discovery of nine binary millisecond pulsars in observations of 47 tucanae at 20-cm @xcite . following the description in section 2 of @xcite  ( 2000 ) ,",
    "the time series is transformed into a frame which is inertial with respect to the pulsar by application of the doppler formula to relate a time interval in the pulsar frame @xmath19 to the time interval in the observed frame @xmath20 , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the changing line - of - sight velocity of the pulsar , @xmath23 is the speed of light , and the constant @xmath24 is chosen such that @xmath19 is equivalent to the sampling interval , @xmath25 at the midpoint of the observation .",
    "new samples are computed from a linear interpolation over the original time series @xcite .",
    "following resampling , the time series can be searched with standard fourier techniques , as if the pulsar were isolated ( see for example @xcite  2005 ) . to fully remove the effects of orbital motion , the exact form of @xmath22",
    "must be known , although in a blind search , where the orbital elements are a priori unknown , this would require a search over five keplerian parameters ; a task that would require significant computational resources ( see for example , @xcite  2001 , and discussion in appendix a ) . to reduce the amount of computation required ,",
    "the assumption of a constant line - of - sight acceleration , @xmath26 , can once again be applied , so that @xmath27 .",
    "now , searches in just one parameter , constant line - of - sight acceleration , @xmath26 , can be made , but in a fully coherent manner .    a step size between each acceleration trial ,",
    "@xmath28 was determined by fixing the amount of signal advance or retardation with respect to either end of the integration in equation 1 is such that resampling is performed with respect to the midpoint of the observation . ] to a value that was deemed acceptable .",
    "this value , which we shall now term ` pulse broadening ' , @xmath29 , was chosen to be four times the sampling interval , @xmath25 , i.e. if the pulsar signal fell between two acceleration trials this would be the maximum value of pulse broadening at the end points of the data .",
    "because of the quadratic nature of the pulse broadening with time , due to a constant acceleration , @xmath26 ( see for example equation 4 in @xcite  1991 ) , @xmath30 at least 50 per cent of pulses in the integration would be smeared in time by less than one time sample . setting the pulse broadening time , given by equation 2 , equal to @xmath31 allows a maximum of @xmath32 pulse smearing for signals that lie exactly in - between acceleration trials .",
    "remembering that resampling is performed with respect to the midpoint of the data , @xmath33 , giving the acceleration step size , @xmath28 : @xmath34 our choice of acceleration step size is illustrated in figure  [ f : sample_broad ] . here",
    "we plot the pulse phase as a function of time for an idealized top hat pulse that has a width equal to a single sample , and that is accelerated to a value that is directly in between acceleration trials .",
    "the pulse phase broadening at the end points of the integration is therefore @xmath32 ; the maximum value it can take . for a broadening of @xmath35 at the end points it can be seen that 50 per cent of the pulses are smeared in phase by less than @xmath36 .",
    "although the total broadening time is less than @xmath25 for half of the observation , the majority of power in a sample will be smeared into the next sample when , for example , @xmath37 , which occurs after @xmath38 using this step size .",
    "the acceleration step size given in equation  [ e : accstep ] scales linearly with the sampling interval and with inverse square of the integration time .",
    "longer integrations and smaller sample intervals therefore require finer acceleration steps . both of these parameters could be tuned within the limits of the pmps data to find an optimum acceleration step size which covered new regions of parameter space without excessive levels of computation .",
    "the final processing parameters of our search algorithm , termed pmaccn , are given in table  [ t : procparams ] .",
    "data processing benchmarks and algorithm performance tests described in @xcite  ( 2009)reatough / reatough_thesis.pdf ] favoured a search based on two independent half segments of the original 35 minute integration , and a sampling interval increased by a factor of four from the original @xmath4 to 1 ms . using this choice of processing parameters a wide range of accelerations ( @xmath39 ) could be searched in a manageable time on the computational hardware available ( see section 4 ) .",
    "the acceleration range chosen is nearly twice the maximum acceleration present in the most relativistic binary pulsar known : the double pulsar system ( @xmath40 : @xcite  2003 , @xcite  2006 ) and is a value that might be expected in compact ns - bh systems ( see section 6 ) . analyzing independent halves",
    "also provided better sensitivity to more compact binary systems ( @xmath41 hr ) that would have been missed by acceleration searches of the full length observation , because of the effects of jerk ( e.g. @xmath42 hr in @xcite  2004 ) .",
    "the sampling interval of 1 ms was not optimal for millisecond pulsars , however it is expected that in most ns - bh systems the pulsar will be the second - born object and will not have undergone recycling ( @xcite  2004 ) .",
    "( thin black lines ) .",
    "arbitrary time intervals are marked by the vertical dotted lines .",
    "the size of the acceleration step is indicated by the vertical arrow on the right . for signals that have a true acceleration that lies in between acceleration trials ,",
    "at least 50 per cent of the pulses are smeared by less than @xmath25 . ]",
    ".pmaccn processing parameters .",
    "the step size in dispersion measure ( dm ) was determined following standard procedures outlined in @xcite  ( 2005 ) .",
    "the range in dm searched was defined by the expected values in the galactic plane given by the @xcite  ( 2002 ) free electron density model of the galaxy .",
    "each data segment corresponds to one independent half of the original 35 minute integration .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]      from an extension of the acceleration algorithm presented in section  3 a step - size in jerk can be computed .",
    "the pulse broadening due to jerk , @xmath43 , can be written , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the value of line - of - sight jerk , typically given in units of @xmath46 , @xmath20 is time and @xmath23 is the speed of light ( see for example equation 4 in @xcite  1991 ) . following the principles outlined in section  3",
    "the maximum acceptable value of pulse broadening due to jerk at either end of the integration should be @xmath47 for at least 50 per cent of the pulses to be smeared by less than one time sample .",
    "a maximum pulse broadening time of @xmath47 allows a step of @xmath48 between jerk trials . setting equation  [ e : jbroad ] equal to this value and",
    "once again letting @xmath33 , the step - size in jerk , @xmath49 can be written as , @xmath50 to find the sensitivity to be gained by correcting for jerk we have re - performed the tests described in section  [ s : int_length_orb_phase ] on the un - modified double pulsar data ( figure  [ f : search_tests ] panels ( a),(b ) , and ( c ) ) .",
    "step sizes have been computed with equations  3 and  [ e : jstep ] and a range in jerk of @xmath51 ( c.f . jerk in double pulsar system @xmath52 ) has been searched .",
    "again , the maximum and average values of @xmath53 across the orbit for the different integration lengths are summarized in table  6 .",
    "tests on the ` modified ' double pulsar system have not been performed due to limitations in available computing power .",
    "for the the shortest quarter - length analysis ( 671 s ) the results are the same as the acceleration tests as no jerk trials are required within the range we have chosen .",
    "for the half - length segments there is no change in the maximum @xmath53 achievable but the average @xmath54 has increased by seven per cent .",
    "the biggest improvement from the application of jerk corrections is in the full - length ( 2684 s ) segments where both the best maximum and average @xmath53 from all of the searches are achieved .",
    "these results can also be seen in figure  [ f : jerk_effect ] where the cumulative value of @xmath53 of psr j0737@xmath123039a from the acceleration and acceleration and jerk searches across the double pulsar orbit are plotted .    from table  6 and figure  [ f : jerk_effect ] it can also be seen that the improvement in average @xmath53 across the orbit between acceleration and jerk searches of the half - length and full - length integrations is small ( factor of @xmath55 ) . because there are a factor of @xmath56 times more trials to perform the acceleration and jerk analyses on the full - length segments compared to the half - length segments , there appears to be large computational expense with little gain in sensitivity .",
    "these lower than expected gains in sensitivity by including jerk trials are most likely due to poor approximation of the line - of - sight orbital motion over the length of the integration . to combat these effects",
    "a third derivative of velocity might need to be included .      ' '' ''        ' '' ''    although no relativistic binary systems have been discovered the acceleration search has produced a number of high - quality candidates that have not been confirmed , despite multiple re - observations at either the parkes or jodrell bank observatories .",
    "figure  [ f : nonconf_eg ] shows an example of one such source , j1431@xmath126042 , a highly accelerated class three candidate .",
    "this candidate has been followed up with a ` grid ' observation ( e.g. @xcite  2002 ) and around four hours of re - observations at parkes . because the orbital phase and hence the orbital acceleration are likely to be different upon re - observation",
    "all the data have been searched in acceleration on the tier2 facility with the pmaccn algorithm , and independently with the presto software suitesransom / presto/ ] over a wider range of accelerations and including corrections for jerk . to date no conclusive re - detection of this candidate has been made .    in total",
    "there are 12 other candidates for which a similar situation applies .",
    "the majority come from our class two and class three candidate lists .",
    "typically these candidates appear accelerated , have a s / n near our detection threshold ( @xmath57 ) , and are often only found in one of the half integrations .",
    "many of these detections might be attributed to strong ` de - accelerated ' rfi signals .",
    "strong periodic rfi can appear in the higher dm trials and sometimes even swept in radio frequency mimicking a dispersed signal .",
    "in addition , rfi signals are typically unstable causing them to drift through a number of spectral bins in the fluctuation spectrum .",
    "if any of these candidates are in fact true celestial sources the systems may have undergone geodetic precession , where the spin axis of the pulsar precesses with respect to the total angular momentum of the system , which is dominated by the orbital angular momentum @xcite . in a manner similar to that shown for psr b1913@xmath5816 by @xcite , the effect may have shifted the orientation of emission beam away from the earth over the @xmath5910 years since the original pmps observation .",
    "this is the current explanation for why the relativistic binary pulsar , j1141@xmath126545 @xcite was not detected in an earlier 70 cm survey that covered the position ( @xcite  2010 ) .",
    "we can estimate the magnitude of geodetic precession for candidates that are close to the orbital period limit of our search .",
    "assuming a minimum detectable orbital period of @xmath60 hrs ( using the pmaccn search algorithm ) gives a precessional rate of 3.5@xmath61 yr@xmath62 for circular dns systems ( neutron star mass of 1.3  @xmath63 ) and 14.7@xmath61 yr@xmath62 for circular ns - bh systems ( black hole mass of 10.0  @xmath63 ) .",
    "although the alignment between the spin axis of the pulsar and orbital angular momentum axis is important in determining by how much the emission beam will move , it is possible that relativistic systems detected in the pmps survey observations may have precessed out of the line - of - sight in the intervening years .    at the time of writing ,",
    "observations to detect un - confirmed candidates from this search are still performed when telescope time becomes available .",
    "a full re - analysis of the pmps has been performed using coherent acceleration searches on independent halves of the original 35 minute integrations .",
    "16 pulsars have been discovered , including a binary millisecond pulsar , an intermittent pulsar , and a pulsar with an interpulse .",
    "no new relativistic binary pulsars have been discovered .",
    "searches for relativistic binaries are already underway in the htru pulsar surveys ( @xcite  2011 , ng et al . in prep ) .",
    "the low - latitude portion of the survey will cover a thin strip ( @xmath64 ) along the galactic plane with integration times of over 70 minutes .",
    "for these long integration times acceleration searches will not be sensitive to the most relativistic binary pulsars ; higher order effects will need to be taken into account ( see section  [ s : incl_jerk ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , it can be shown that searches in these higher order effects are still computationally prohibitive for long integrations . assuming a sampling interval of @xmath65 and using step - sizes in acceleration and jerk given by equations  [ e : accstep ] and [ e : jstep ] respectively , corrections for the effects of both acceleration and jerk in a ` double pulsar like ' system would require of the order of @xmath66 trials per dm trial for a 70 minute observation ( c.f .",
    "59 acceleration trials per dm as in this work ) . for the analysis of the low - latitude htru data , either incoherent methods such as stack searches ( eatough et al . in prep ) , or coherent acceleration searches of different length but shorter segments of the original 70 minute observations should be performed ( ng et al . in prep ) .",
    "because of the limitations of the acceleration search performed in this work , a full re - processing of the pmps has been conducted utilizing the einstein@home network .",
    "this search applies matched filters to coherently de - modulate the data based on a number of keplerian orbital templates , which allows the full integration length to be searched ( knispel et al . in prep ) .",
    "the discovery and timing of highly relativistic binary pulsars is one of the key science projects of the ska ( @xcite  2004 ) .",
    "as well as offering highly rewarding discoveries , current searches for such systems , both in archival data and in data from the latest pulsar surveys , will provide considerable information on the binary parameter space still to be searched in , and on the strategy of future pulsar surveys .",
    "this research was partly funded by grants from the science & technology facilities council .",
    "the parkes radio telescope is part of the australia telescope national facility which is funded by the commonwealth of australia for operation as a national facility managed by csiro .",
    "this work was based on observations with the 100-m telescope of the mpifr ( max - planck - institut fr radioastronomie ) at effelsberg .",
