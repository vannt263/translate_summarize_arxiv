    "the observed corrlated fluctuations in the stock markets , giving power law tails for large fluctuations ( in contrast to the traditionally assumed exponentially decaying gaussian fluctuations of random walks ) , were schematically incorporated in the el farol bar problem of arthur  @xcite . here",
    "the decision to occupy the bar ( buy the stock ) or to remaing at home ( sell the stock ) depends on the previous experience of the  crowd \" exceeding the threshold ( of pleasure or demand level ) of the bar ( stock ) , and the strategies available .",
    "the resulting minority game models  @xcite still fail to get the ubiquitus inverse cubic law of stock fluctuations  @xcite . in the fiber bundle models",

    "the avalanche distribution has a clear inverse cubic power law tail in the  equal load sharing \" or  democratic \" fiber bundle model  @xcite .    in the el farol bar problem  @xcite , the santa fe",
    "people decide whether to go to the bar this evening , based on his / her experince last evening(s ) .",
    "the bar can roughly accommodate half the poulation of the ( 100-member strong ) institute and the people coming to the bar still enjoy the music and the food .",
    "if the crowd level goes beyond this level , people do not enjoy and each of those who came to the bar thinks that they would have done better if they stayed back at home !",
    "clearly , people do not randomly choose to come to the bar or stay at home ( as assumed in a random walk model ) ; they exploit their past experience and their respective strategy ( to decide on the basis of the past experience ) .",
    "of course the people here are assumed to have all the same informations at any time ( and their respective personal experiences ) available to decide for themselves independently and parallely ; they do not organise among themselves and go to the bar !",
    "had the choice been completely random , the occupation fluctuation of the bar would be gaussian . because of the processes involved in deciding to go or not , depending on the respective experience , the occupation fluctuation statistics changes .",
    "minority \" people win such games ( all the people  lose \" their money if the bar gets  crowded \" , or more than the threshold , say , 50 here ) ; the bar represents either the  buy \" or  sell \" room and the ( single ) stock fluctuations are expected to be represented well by the model .",
    "the memory size and the bag of tricks for each agent in the minority game model made this process and the resulting analysis very precise  @xcite .",
    "still , as we mentioned earlier , it can not explain the origin of the ubiquitous inverse cubic law of fluctuations ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we extend here this simple bar problem to many bars ( or from single stock to many ) , and define the kolkata restaurant problem .",
    "the number of restaurants in kolkata , unlike in santa fe , are huge .",
    "their ( pleasure level ) thresholds are also widely distributed .",
    "the number of people , who choose among these restaurants , are also huge !",
    "additionally , we assume that the decision making part here in the kolkata restaurant problem to be extremely simple ( compared to the el farol bar problem ) : if there had been any  bad experience \" ( say , crowd going beyond threshold level ) in any restaurant any evening , all those who came there that evening avoid that one for a suitably chosen long time period ( @xmath0 ) and starting next evening redistribute this extra crowd or load equally among the rest of the restaurants in kolkata ( equal or democratic crowd sharing ) .",
    "this restaurant or the stock fails ( for the next @xmath0 evenings ) . as mentioned before",
    ", this failure will naturally increase the crowd level in all the other restaurants , thereby inducing the possibility of further failure of the restaurants in service ( or service stocks ) .",
    "if @xmath0 is finite but large , the system of restaurants in kolkata would actually organise itself into a",
    " critical \" state with a robust and precise inverse cubic power law of ( occupation or in - service number ) fluctuation .",
    "this we will show here analytically .",
    "let @xmath1 represent the number of restaurants in kolkata .",
    "they are certainly not identical in their size and comfort threshold levels .",
    "let @xmath2 denote respectively the crowd threshold levels of these @xmath1 restaurants .",
    "if , in any evening , the crowd level @xmath3 in the @xmath4th restaurant exceeds @xmath5 , then all the @xmath3 number ( fraction , when normalised ) of persons coming to the @xmath4th restaurant that evening decide not to come to that restaurant for the next @xmath0 evenings , and the @xmath4th restaurant goes out of service for the next @xmath0 evenings ( because others got satisfaction from the restaurants they went last evening , and therefore do not change their choice ) . if @xmath6 is the total number ( assumed to be large and fixed ) of people regularly going to various restaurants in kolkata , and if we assume that people choose completely randomly among all the restaurants in service ( democratic or equal load sharing hypothesis and  knowledge \" of the  in - service \" restaurants available to everybody ) , the  avalanches \" dynamics of these restaurants to fall out of service , can be analytically investigated if @xmath7 and the threshold crowd level distribution @xmath8 for the restaurants are known ( see figs .",
    "[ ccfig1 ] and  [ ccfig2 ] ) .",
    "this avalanche dynamics can be represented by recursion relations in discrete time steps .",
    "let us define @xmath9 to be the fraction of in - service restaurants in the city that survive after ( discrete ) time step @xmath10 ( evenings ) , counted from the time @xmath11 when the load or crowd ( at the level @xmath12 ) is put in the system ( time step indicates the number of crowd redistributions ) .",
    "as such , @xmath13 for all @xmath10 and @xmath14 for @xmath11 for any @xmath3 ; @xmath15 for @xmath16 if @xmath17 , and @xmath18 for @xmath16 if @xmath19 .",
    "if @xmath3 is measured in the unit of the crowd threshold of the biggest restaurant in kolkata , or in other words , if @xmath3 is normalised to unity and @xmath20 is assumed to be uniformly distributed as shown in fig .",
    "[ ccfig3 ] ( and @xmath21 as mentioned ) , then @xmath22 follows a simple recursion relation ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath23 @xmath24 in equilibrium @xmath25 and thus ( 1 ) is quadratic in @xmath26 : @xmath27 the solution is @xmath28 here @xmath29 is the critical value of crowd level ( per restaurant ) beyond which the system of ( all the kolkata ) restaurants fails completely . the quantity @xmath30 must be real valued as it has a physical meaning : it is the fraction of the restaurants that remains in service under a fixed crowd or load @xmath3 when the load per restaurant lies in the range @xmath31 .",
    "clearly , @xmath32 .",
    "the solution with ( @xmath33 ) sign is therefore the only physical one .",
    "hence , the physical solution can be written as @xmath34 for @xmath35 we can not get a real - valued fixed point as the dynamics never stops until @xmath36 when the network of restaurants get completely out of business !        it may be noted that the quantity @xmath38 behaves like an order parameter that determines a transition from a state of partial failure of the system ( at @xmath39 ) to a state of total failure ( at @xmath35 ) : @xmath40    to study the dynamics away from criticality ( @xmath41 from below ) , we replace the recursion relation ( 1 ) by a differential equation @xmath42 close to the fixed point we write @xmath43 + @xmath44 ( where @xmath45 ) .",
    "this gives @xmath46 where @xmath47   $ ] .",
    "thus , near the critical point ( for jamming transition ) we can write @xmath48 therefore the relaxation time diverges following a power - law as @xmath41 from below .    one can also consider the breakdown susceptibility @xmath49 , defined as the change of @xmath50 due to an infinitesimal increment of the traffic stress @xmath51 @xmath52 hence the susceptibility diverges as the average crowd level @xmath53 approaches the critical value @xmath54 .      at the critical point ( @xmath56 ) , we observe a different dynamic critical behavior in the relaxation of the failure process . from the recursion relation ( [ cc : recur ] ) , it can be shown that decay of the fraction @xmath57 of restaurants that remain in service at time @xmath58 follows a simple power - law decay : @xmath59 starting from @xmath60 .",
    "for large @xmath58 ( @xmath61 ) , this reduces to @xmath62 ; @xmath63 ; a power law , and is a robust characterization of the critical state .",
    "the universality class of the model can be checked [ 4 ] taking two other types of restaurant capacity distributions @xmath64 : ( i ) linearly increasing density distribution and ( ii ) linearly decreasing density distribution of the crowd fraction thresholds @xmath3 within the limit @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "one can show that while @xmath67 changes with different strength distributions ( @xmath68 for case ( i ) and @xmath69 for case ( ii ) , the critical behavior remains unchanged : @xmath70 , @xmath71 for all these equal crowd or load sharing models .      for @xmath17",
    ", the avalance size @xmath72 can be defined as the fraction of restaurants falling out of service for an infinitesimal increase in the global crowd level ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath73 with @xmath74 taken from ( 2 ) , we get @xmath75 if we now denote the avalanche size distribution by @xmath76 , then @xmath77 measures @xmath78 along the @xmath72 versus @xmath3 curve in ( [ cc : dmdsigma ] ) .",
    "in other words  @xcite @xmath79",
    "the above results are for @xmath7 , i.e , when any restaurant fails to satisfy its customers , it falls out of business , and customers never come back to it .",
    "this would also be valid if @xmath0 is greater than the relaxation time @xmath80 defined in ( [ cc : epsilon ] ) .",
    "however , if such a restaurant again comes back to service ( people either forget or hope that it has got better in service and start choosing it again ) after @xmath0 evenings , then several scenerios can emerge .    if @xmath0 is very small , the recursion relation ( [ cc : recur ] ) can be written as @xmath81 in fact , if @xmath0 is large , @xmath82 and ( [ cc : recurtsm ] ) reduces to ( [ cc : recur ] ) . however",
    ", if @xmath0 is very small , say of the order of unity , then at the fixed point , @xmath83 and one gets @xmath84 from ( [ cc : dmdsigma ] ) one gets @xmath85 where @xmath86 is determined by the initial conditions .",
    "we generalise here the el farol bar problem to that of many bars .",
    "this leads us to the kolkata restaurant problem , where the decision to go to any restaurant or not is much simpler ; it still depends on the previous experience of course , as in the el farol bar problem , but does not explicitly depend on the memory size or the size of the strategy pool .",
    "rather , people getting disappointed with any restaurant on any evening avoids that restaurant for the next @xmath0 evenings .",
    "this generalised problem can be exactly analysed in some limiting cases discussed here . in the @xmath7 limit",
    ", the fluctuation in the restaurant service can be shown to have precisely an inverse cubic behavior ( see eqn .",
    "( [ cc : dpdm ] ) ) , as widely seen in the stock market fluctuations . for very small values of @xmath0 , the fluctuatuation distribution become @xmath87-function like ( see eqn .",
    "( [ cc : pm ] ) ) . for large but finite @xmath0",
