    "in a nowadays classical paper by talenti @xcite , it was proved that if @xmath2 is a @xmath3 concave solution of the monge - ampre equation @xmath4 with @xmath5 positive and sufficiently smooth function , then @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the positive concave solution of the problem @xmath8 here @xmath9 is the disk centered at the origin with the same perimeter of @xmath0 , @xmath10 is the spherically decreasing rearrangement of @xmath5 , and @xmath11 is the spherically decreasing function in @xmath9 whose level sets have the same perimeter of the level sets of @xmath2 .",
    "hence , among all the problems of the type with prescribed perimeter of @xmath0 and fixed rearrangement of @xmath5 , problem gives the `` maximal '' solution .",
    "after this result , generalizations in several directions have been studied ( see for example @xcite ) . moreover ,",
    "it was proved in @xcite , @xcite that a plya - szeg type inequality for the monge - ampre operator holds , namely @xmath12 hence , the symmetrization with respect to the perimeter decreases the hessian integral .    in this paper",
    "we take into account a class of fully nonlinear elliptic anisotropic operators of the second order , which contains the classical monge - ampre operator .",
    "more precisely , we consider a sufficiently smooth norm @xmath13 of @xmath14 , and denote with @xmath15 its polar function ( see section 2 for the precise assumptions ) . if @xmath2 a smooth concave function , we take into account the following anisotropic monge - ampre operator @xmath16:=\\det \\nabla^{2}_{\\xi } f \\,\\det \\nabla^{2 } u , \\vspace{.1cm}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the @xmath20 matrix of the second derivatives of @xmath21 .",
    "we observe that when @xmath13 is the euclidean norm of @xmath1 , then the matrix @xmath22 reduces to the identity , and reduces with the classical monge - ampre operator .",
    "several kind of problems related to anisotropic operators have been largely studied in last years .",

    "the aim of this paper is to prove a suitable generalization of the inequalities and for the operator using a new type of symmetrization .",
    "more precisely , given a concave smooth function @xmath2 , the rearranged function we introduce preserves the anisotropic perimeter of its level sets , that is a suitable measure of the length of @xmath23 which takes into account the anisotropy @xmath13 . for this purpose",
    "a fundamental tool is a well - known anisotropic isoperimetric inequality ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , a key role is played by a relation between the operator and the anisotropic curvature of the level sets of @xmath2 ( see sections 2 and 3 ) .",

    "we state the main hypotheses on the norm @xmath13 , and we recall the definition of anisotropic perimeter and curvature , proving a version of the gauss - bonnet theorem in this setting . in section 3 , we introduce the anisotropic monge - ampre operator , proving its connection with the anisotropic curvature .",
    "moreover , we compute the operator for functions which are symmetric with respect to @xmath24 .",
    "the section 4 is devoted to define the symmetrization with respect to the anisotropic perimeter and to prove the plya - szeg inequality . finally , in section 5",
    "we prove the quoted comparison result in the spirit of talenti s inequality .",
