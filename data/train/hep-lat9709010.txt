    "weak matrix elements of @xmath1 meson such as @xmath0 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 form factors are important quantities for the determination of cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix elements . however simulating the @xmath5-quark with high precision is still a challenge in lattice qcd , since the @xmath5-quark mass in the lattice unit is large , @xmath6 23 , even in recent lattice calculations .",
    "one approach to deal with the heavy quark is to extrapolate the matrix elements for heavy - light meson around the charm quark mass region to the @xmath5-quark mass assuming @xmath7 scaling .",
    "it is , however , rather difficult to control the systematic uncertainty in this approach , since the systematic error tends to become larger as increasing @xmath8 .",
    "an alternative approach is to use an effective nonrelativistic action . in table",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in this report , we present our study of the decay constant of @xmath1 meson and @xmath9 semi - leptonic decay form factors with nrqcd action .",
    "we study the mass dependence of these quantities by simulating heavy - light mesons over a wide range of the heavy quark mass . in section [ sec : decay_const ] , we study the 1/m dependence of the heavy - light decay constant using nonrelativistic action of @xmath10 .",
    "the systematic errors due the truncation of higher order relativistic correction terms are estimated . in section [ sec : form_factor ] we describe the first computation of the @xmath9 semi - leptonic decay form factors with nrqcd action of @xmath11 .",
    "section [ sec : discussion ] is devoted for discussion and future problems .",
    "in the nrqcd approach it is very important to investigate the size of the systematic error arising from the truncation of the action at a certain order of @xmath12 .",
    "earlier studies on @xmath0 by davies et al.@xcite and hashimoto@xcite and the subsequent work by nrqcd group@xcite , where @xmath5-quark is simulated with the nrqcd action including up to @xmath13 terms , showed that @xmath14 correction of @xmath0 from the static limit is significantly large",
    ". thus the effect of the higher order correction of @xmath10 could be important . in this section ,",
    "we compare the @xmath1 meson decay constant obtained from the action including @xmath15 terms only and that including @xmath16 terms entirely .",

    "the coefficients @xmath20 are unity at tree level and should be determined by perturbatively matching the action to that in relativistic qcd in order to include the 1-loop corrections . @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote the symmetric lattice differentiation in spatial directions and laplacian respectively and @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24 and @xmath25 are generated from the standard clover - leaf field strength .",
    "the original 4-component heavy quark spinor @xmath26 is decomposed into two 2-component spinors @xmath27 and @xmath28 after foldy - wouthuysen - tani ( fwt ) transformation : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is an inverse fwt transformation matrix which has @xmath31 spin and @xmath32 color indices .",
    "after discretization , at the tree level @xmath30 is written as follows : @xmath33 where @xmath34 we apply the tadpole improvement@xcite to all link variables in the evolution equation and @xmath30 by rescaling the link variables as @xmath35 .",
    "we define two sets of action and current operator \\{@xmath36,@xmath30 } as follows , @xmath37 where @xmath38 @xmath39 and @xmath40 include only @xmath11 terms while @xmath41 and @xmath42 keep entire @xmath10 terms and the leading relativistic correction to the dispersion relation , which is an @xmath43 term .",
    "the terms improving the discretization errors appearing in @xmath44 and time evolution are also included .",
    "using these two sets , we can realize two levels of accuracy of @xmath11 and @xmath10 .",

    ", we use wilson action at @xmath50= 0.1600 , 0.1585 , and 0.1570 ( @xmath51 ) which correspond to @xmath52@xmath53 .",

    "we are also planning to carry out the simulations at higher @xmath65 values with @xmath66-improved wilson light quark to remove @xmath66 error in near future .",
    "in this section we report our study of @xmath67 semi - leptonic decay form factors .",
    "this is the first calculation with the nrqcd action .",
    "earlier attempts to calculate the form factors were made by ape@xcite , ukqcd@xcite , wuppertal@xcite by extrapolating the results in the d meson mass region obtained with the clover action assuming heavy quark scaling law .",
    "direct simulation would be certainly necessary as an alternative approach just as in the calculation of @xmath0 in order to investigate the mass dependence and to obtain reliable results .",
    "the status of form factors with wilson / clover as well as fermilab action is summarized in refs.@xcite .",
    "the semi - leptonic decay form factors @xmath68 and @xmath69 are defined as follows @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 has a normalization @xmath73 the virtual @xmath74 boson mass @xmath75 takes a value in a region @xmath76 where @xmath77 . in the rest frame of the initial @xmath1 meson , pion is also almost at rest in the large @xmath75 region ( @xmath78 ) , where the @xmath74 boson carries a large fraction of released energy from the @xmath1 meson . in the small @xmath75 region",
    "( @xmath79 0 ) , on the other hand , the pion is strongly kicked and has a large spatial momentum ( @xmath80 a few gev / c ) . lattice calculation is not reliably applicable for the small @xmath75 region , since the discretization error of @xmath81 becomes unacceptably large .",
    "this leads to a fundamental restriction in the kinematical region where lattice calculation may offer a reliable result .",
    "the differential decay rate is given as @xmath82 where @xmath83 the decay rate vanishes at @xmath84 because the phase space gets smaller .",
    "it is , thus , essential to calculate @xmath85 in a @xmath75 region where the experimental data will become available and the systematic error does not spoil the reliability , in order to determine @xmath86 model independently .    another important feature of the @xmath1 meson semi - leptonic decay is the implication of the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet)@xcite . in the heavy quark mass limit , it is more natural to normalize the heavy meson state as @xmath87 instead of the covariant normalization ( [ eq : covariant_normalization ] ) . with this normalization",
    ", the large mass scale @xmath88 is removed from the theory and one can use the heavy quark expansion . the amplitude may be expanded as @xmath89 where @xmath90 is a velocity of the heavy meson and @xmath91 , @xmath92 , ... are functions of @xmath93 .",
    "it is worth to note that the heavy quark mass extrapolation and interpolation have to be done with @xmath93 fixed . in the rest frame of the heavy meson ,",
    "this condition implies fixed pion momentum , since @xmath93 becomes @xmath94 .",
    "we propose to study the @xmath2 dependence of the following quantities @xmath95 which are natural generalization of @xmath57 for the the heavy - light decay constant . indeed",
    "these quantities are almost raw number which one obtains in the lattice calculation as magnitudes of corresponding three - point functions , and then free from other ambiguities such as the choice of mass parameter of the heavy quark and the discretization of the spatial momenta .",

    "the fwt transformation operator @xmath30 is identical to that in eq .",
    "( [ eq : r1 ] ) numerical simulation has been done on the same 120 gauge configurations as was used for the decay constant . for the light",
    "quarks we use the wilson fermion at @xmath98 0.1570 . the following six sets of parameters for the heavy quark mass and the stabilization parameter ; @xmath99 = ( 5.0,1 ) , ( 2.6,1 ) , ( 2.1,1 ) , ( 1.5,2 ) , ( 1.2,2 ) , and ( 0.9,2 ) . @xmath100 and",
    "@xmath101 roughly correspond to @xmath5- and @xmath102-quark masses respectively .",
    "matrix elements are extracted from the three - point correlation functions : @xmath103 where @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 indicate the location of the initial state @xmath1 meson , heavy - light current and the final state pion respectively .",
    "we fix @xmath107 and @xmath108 , and @xmath104 is a variable .",
    "the amplitude @xmath109 is obtained by dividing the above expression by the corresponding two - point functions .      in this section",
    ", we present our numerical results .    in order to see whether the contamination from the excited state is sufficiently small , we examine the effective mass plots of the two - point functions of pion and @xmath1 meson , and three - point functions .",
    "= 7.0 cm    figure [ fig : efp_pi ] shows the effective mass plot for the pion with finite spatial momenta up to @xmath110 .",
    "correlation functions seem to reach to the ground state beyond @xmath111 , except for @xmath112 where statistical error becomes too large to extract reliable ground state energy . we , therefore , use momentum values up to @xmath113 in the following analysis .",
    "the maximum momentum value corresponds to @xmath114 1 gev / c in the physical unit .",
    "= 7.0 cm    the momentum dependence of the pion energy should obey the dispersion relation @xmath115 in the continuum limit .",
    "then the deviation of the lattice dispersion relation from the continuum one is a good indicator of the discretization error . in figure",
    "[ fig : light_dr ] we plot the dispersion relation for @xmath116 and @xmath117 mesons measured in our simulations .",
    "solid lines represent the above expression ( [ eq : dr_cont ] ) , which does not fit the measured point , showing the effect of the @xmath66 discretization error .",
    "= 7.0 cm    a similar plot for the @xmath1 meson is found in figure [ fig : efp_b_l ] , where the maximum momentum is @xmath113 .",
    "the fitting interval is chosen to be 16 - 24 where the contamination of excited state is negligible for each momentum values .",
    "= 7.0 cm    = 7.0 cm    figures [ fig : effv4 ] and [ fig : effvi ] show the effective mass plots for three point functions with temporal and spatial currents respectively .",
    "the location of the interpolating field of the @xmath1 meson is varied to define the effective mass , then the energy should coincide with that obtained from the two - point function if the ground state is sufficiently isolated .",
    "we observe clear plateau in a wide range for @xmath118 of 23 - 28 and the mass values consistent with that from the two - point functions , which are shown as solid lines in the figures .",
    "we are now confident that the ground state is reliably extracted for both two - point and three - point functions , and present the results for the matrix elements . since @xmath7 dependence of the matrix elements is the main issue in this study , we plot @xmath119 and @xmath120 , defined in ( [ eq : v4 ] ) and ( [ eq : vi ] ) respectively , which obeys the simple heavy mass scaling law ( [ eq:1/m - expansion ] ) , in figures [ fig : v4 ] and [ fig : vki ] .",
    "we observe that @xmath7 dependence of matrix elements is rather small in contrast to the large @xmath7 correction for the heavy - light decay constant @xmath121 .",
    "although intuitive interpretation of this result is difficult , the smallness of the @xmath7 correction is a good news to obtain the form factor with high precision , because the error in setting the @xmath5-quark mass does not affect the prediction . and",
    "also this behavior is consistent with the previous works@xcite , in which the heavy quark mass is much smaller than ours .",
    "= 7.0 cm    = 7.0 cm    the @xmath75 dependence of the form factors @xmath122 and @xmath123 is shown in figure [ fig : ff0201 ] .",
    "the heavy quark mass is roughly corresponding to the @xmath5-quark .",
    "as we discussed previously the accessible @xmath75 region is rather restricted .",
    "it is , however , interesting that already at this stage one is able to see the momentum dependence which could really be tested by looking at the momentum spectrum data in the future @xmath1 factories .",
    "we have studied @xmath124 dependence of the heavy - light decay constant and semi - leptonic decay form factors with nrqcd action .",
    "we find that the error of truncating higher order relativistic correction term is as small as 6% for the decay constant .",
    "we also find that the semi - leptonic decay form factor for @xmath125 has very small @xmath124 dependence , which is consistent with the previous results in the wilson / clover approach .    to obtain the physical result for extracting @xmath126 matrix elements , chiral limit for the light quark must be taken and calculation of the renormalization constant @xmath127 at one - loop is required , which is now underway .",
    "one of the largest problem is that so far , due to low statistics and the discretization errors of @xmath128 , lattice calculation works only for rather small recoil region , where the statistics of the experimental data is not high due to the phase space suppression .",
    "we are planning to carry out simulations with much higher statistics , with larger @xmath65 and with improved light quarks so that we can push up the accessible momentum region .",
    "it is also true that more data from cleo , or future @xmath1 factories is required for relatively small recoil region @xmath129 1 gev , where the lattice calculation is most reliable .",
