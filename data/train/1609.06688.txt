    "the quest for a detailed quantitative understanding of the nucleon form factors is an active field in hadronic physics .",
    "a wide variety of models has been proposed to describe the nucleon form factors . however , in most of these approaches there has been no attempt to understand the observed hadron spectroscopy .",
    "furthermore , a consensus among different phenomenological models and parameterizations which describe the nucleon form factors has not yet been achieved , especially for the neutron dirac and pauli electromagnetic form factors , nor the nucleon time - like form factors .",

    "it should be noted that inconsistencies in the extraction of the data appear in the proton electric to magnetic sachs form factor ( ff ) ratio @xmath7 , when one compares double polarization experiments  @xcite , in which the ratio @xmath8 decreases almost linearly for momentum transfer @xmath9 , with the results obtained from the rosenbluth separation method  @xcite in which @xmath8 remains constant in the space - like ( sl ) region .",
    "predictions for different combinations of the neutron ffs are even more puzzling to explain using phenomenological models .",
    "a further limitation is that experimental data for the neutron ffs is not available in the large @xmath10 regime .",

    "this connection also implies that the light - front effective potential @xmath32 in the lf hamiltonian equations , corresponds to the modification of the infrared region of ads space usually described in terms of a dilaton profile : its specific form is given by superconformal quantum mechanics  @xcite , which captures the relevant aspects of color confinement based on a universal emerging single mass scale @xmath33  @xcite .    this new approach",
    "to hadron physics predicts universal linear regge trajectories and slopes in both orbital angular momentum and radial excitation quantum numbers , the appearance of a massless pion in the limit of zero - mass quarks , and gives remarkable connections between the light meson and nucleon spectra  @xcite .",
    "the superconformal approach has thus the advantage that mesons and nucleons are treated on the same footing , and the confinement potential is uniquely determined by the formalism .",
    "remarkably , the meson spectrum and baryon spectrum are related by a simple shift of the orbital angular momentum @xmath34 .",
    "the qcd running coupling is also consistently described at both small and large @xmath14  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will calculate the space - like nucleon electromagnetic ( em ) form factors within the framework of lfhqcd  @xcite .",
    "in the gravity theory , ffs are computed from the overlap integral of normalizable modes , which represent the incoming and outgoing hadrons , convoluted with a non - normalizable mode which represents an electromagnetic current  @xcite .",
    "the em current propagates into the infrared modified ads space and generates an infinite number of poles .",
    "thus , the ff in the gravity theory has the advantage that it generates the nonperturbative pole structure in the time - like region of the ff  @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to find a precise mapping between a `` dressed '' em current propagating in a modified ads space , and the lf qcd drell - yan - west expression for the form factor . in this case",
    "the resulting lfwf incorporates non - valence higher fock states generated by the confined current  @xcite .",
    "the gauge / gravity duality also incorporates the connection between the twist - scaling dimension @xmath35 of the qcd boundary interpolating operators with the fall - off of the normalizable modes in ads near its conformal boundary  @xcite , consistent with leading - twist scaling ; _",
    "i.e. _ , in agreement with the power - law fall - off of the counting rules for hard scattering dynamics at large @xmath14  @xcite . here",
    ", the twist is defined as @xmath36 , where n is the number of constituents and",
    "l is the relative angular momentum between the constituents .    when computing nucleon ffs one has to constrain the asymptotic boundary conditions of the leading fall - off of the form factors to match the twist of the nucleon s interpolating operator , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath37 , to represent the fact that at high virtualities the nucleon is essentially a system of 3 weakly interacting partons . for a multi - quark bound state , the lf invariant impact variable @xmath31 corresponds to a system composed of an active quark plus a spectator  cluster \" .",
    "for example , for a three - quark nucleon state , the three - body problem is reduced to an effective two - body problem where two of the constituents form a diquark cluster  @xcite .",
    "this follows from the holographic approach , where one has only one variable to describe the internal structure of the nucleon .",
    "this means , for example , that for a proton the bound state behaves as a quark - diquark system , _",
    "i.e. _ , like a twist-2 system . however , at large momentum transfer , or at small distances , where the cluster is resolved into its individual constituents , the nucleon is governed by twist-3 , in contrast to the nonperturbative region where it is approximated by twist-2",
    ". a similar feature appears in the study of sequential decay chains in baryons  @xcite , which are sensitive to the short distance behavior of the wave function .",
    "the eigenfunctions which follows from computing the spectrum of the nucleon are leading twist-2 , since essentially the nonperturbative eigenvalue equation describes the dynamics of a quark - diquark cluster .",
    "at very short distances , the bound state is a twist-3 as the two constituents particles in the diquark are resolved .",
    "this different scaling behavior of the structure functions at low and high virtualities can be properly addressed from the lf cluster decomposition for bound states  @xcite and will be discussed below .",
    "in contrast to the prototypical example of the gauge / gravity duality , the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite , where the baryon is identified as an @xmath38 singlet bound state of @xmath39 quarks in the large-@xmath39 limit , in the lfhqcd formalism , baryons are computed for @xmath40 not @xmath41 .",
    "the nucleon ads solutions have both a @xmath42 and a @xmath43 components with equal weight",
    ". therefore we use both twist @xmath44 and @xmath45 to compute the valence contribution to the nucleon form factors .",
    "the space - like pauli ff of the nucleons arises from the overlap of @xmath42 and @xmath43 ads wavefunctions  @xcite .",
    "it is important to recall that the spin - flavor symmetry is not contained in the holographic principles , which essentially describes the @xmath14 scale dependence for a given twist , and has to be imposed from the symmetries of the quark model under consideration . in the present work we use the su(6 ) spin - flavor symmetry and examine possible breaking effects of this symmetry .    in holographic qcd gluonic degrees of freedom only arise at high virtuality , whereas gluons with small virtuality are sublimated in the effective confining potential  @xcite .",
    "thus , fock states of hadrons can have any number of extra @xmath46 pairs created by the confining potential .",
    "one can extend the formalism in order to examine the contribution of higher - fock states using the holographic framework described here .",
    "indeed , it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that higher fock components are essential to describe the rather complex time - like structure of the pion ff .",
    "contribution from the higher - twist components ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) has also been considered to describe the pion transition ff in @xmath49  @xcite .",
    "contributions from three , four , and five parton components in the nucleon fock expansion have been considered in the holographic qcd framework in ref .",
    "@xcite , but the experimental data of a different combination of sachs ffs , such as @xmath50 , could not be successfully described .",
    "more recent work  @xcite by the same group can describe the experimental data of nucleon ffs well , but the number of parameters required to describe the experimental data is large , typically about 8 free parameters and , additionally , an explicit scale dependence of a given process is introduced .",
    "other attempts to describe the flavor nucleon ffs in ads / qcd also require a large number of parameters  @xcite . on the other hand , simple holographic models",
    "which essentially include only the valence contribution , fail to systematically account for all the properties of the nucleon ffs and their flavor decomposition  @xcite .",
    "as we will show below , higher - twist components in the fock expansion are in general needed for an accurate description of the nucleon ffs , and , in fact , this can be achieved with a minimal number of parameters in the lf holographic framework .",

    "@xcite , and as a possible axial - vector diquark contribution in refs .",
    "however , a recent high precision lattice qcd calculation  @xcite indicates that the strange quark contribution to the proton emffs is quite small .",
    "the flavor ff data is also well described by eqs .",
    "( [ protonf1 ] ) , ( [ protonf2 ] ) , ( [ neutronf2 ] ) and ( [ f1nmod ] ) .    .",

    "the data is from ref .",
    "width=396,height=264 ]    fig : f2q    finally , it is important to recall that we have used a universal value for the confinement scale @xmath111 in deriving eq .",
    "( [ fftau ] ) , but in fact the value of @xmath111 for the nucleon wave function , which is obtained from the nucleon slope , is slightly smaller than the value of @xmath111 in the em current which is obtained from the rho mass  @xcite ; it determines the slope of the vector meson trajectory of radial excitations the poles in the em current .",
    "indeed , as described above , we have used the difference in the value of the scale @xmath111 , obtained from the average of all meson and all baryon trajectories to evaluate the theoretical uncertainty of our holographic model .",
    "since the wave function determines the low energy bound state dynamics , we expect that observables which depend on the nucleon wave function , such as radii , are more sensitive to the lower value of @xmath111 , whereas at higher energies , where the amplitudes depend on the structure of the vector meson poles , we would expect that the data is better described by the slightly higher value of @xmath111 from the rho trajectory of radial excitations .",
    "a simple analysis of the data shows that this is indeed the case .",
    "we have performed a complete analysis of the nucleon electromagnetic form factors in the space - like region in the framework of light - front holographic qcd .",
    "the essential dynamical element in our approach is the embedding of superconformal quantum mechanics in ads , which fixes its deformation  @xcite .",
    "the essential parameter in the model is the confinement scale @xmath140 which is universal for the light hadrons and is determined by hadron spectroscopy .",
    "this universality holds to better than @xmath141 accuracy  @xcite , and has been used to describe a variety of fairly disconnected measurements , such as mass spectra of mesons and nucleons  @xcite , form factors  @xcite and the infrared behavior of the strong qcd coupling @xmath142  @xcite .",
    "this @xmath141 departure from universality stems from the approximations used such as neglecting quark masses necessary to construct a calculable semiclassical model based on light front holographic qcd .    in the present article",
    ", we have considered the effects of the pion cloud , the contribution of which depends on the process , giving information on the relevance of higher fock states . for the spin - flip pauli form factors , we find an admixture of a five quark state of about 30@xmath2 in the proton and about 40@xmath2 in the neutron , and essentially no contribution of the higher fock components to the spin - non - flip dirac form factors .",
    "this relatively important contribution of the higher fock components to the pauli form factor of the nucleons is rather startling , and may be related to the fact that the spin - flip form factor corresponds to a change of light - front orbital angular momentum @xmath143 .",
    "likewise , the spin - conserving transition form factor of the proton to a roper resonance , which can be interpreted as a radial transition from @xmath144 , also requires higher fock components to describe the low energy data  @xcite .",
    "since the holographic model does not include spin - flavor structure , we have used the su(6 ) symmetry to determine the effective electromagnetic couplings to the quarks for the spin non - flip form factors .",
    "this choice , however , is not accurate enough if cancellations are required , as in the case of the neutron dirac form factor . in this case",
    "an additional parameter @xmath3 has to be introduced ( see eq .",
    "( [ f1nmod ] ) ) which accounts for the lack of non - zero constraint of the neutron dirac form factor at @xmath99 , possible su(6 ) spin - flavor symmetry breaking effects and leading order cancellation between the squares of the wave functions at low @xmath14 in the neutron . for the spin - flip form factors we use the experimental values of the anomalous magnetic moments as an effective coupling .",
    "note that in order to obtain agreement with data , one has to apply a constant shift of the poles predicted by ads / qcd in the expression for the dressed current to their physical locations .",
    "these shifted locations are then obtained from the bound state equations of the hadrons in this model .",
    "the simple holographic model described here reproduces quite well the main features of the nucleon form factor data . indeed , with the confinement scale fixed by hadron spectroscopy and the anomalous magnetic moments of proton and neutron fixed by experiment , we have introduced only 3 free parameters to describe an extensive set of data of the nucleon electromagnetic form factors .",
    "our results for the nucleon form factors and their flavor decomposition , agree very well with existing data and provide predictions for the various nucleon form factors in the large momentum transfer regions , which have not been explored by the experiments yet .",
    "the charge and magnetic radii of the proton and neutron were extracted and found to agree , within the estimated uncertainty , with their experimental determinations .",
    "our value of the proton charge radius favors the muon lamb shift determination . in general , the approximations from lfhqcd lead to uncertainties of about @xmath141 .",
    "our results should be considered within this typical accuracy .",
    "the new jlab experiments will provide a valuable test for our light - front holographic framework which explores the nucleon structure with a minimal number of free parameters .    since the analytic expression for the form factors ( [ fftau ] ) contains the time - like poles , it is especially suited to describe the nucleon form factors also in the time - like region , as has been done already for the pion form factor in refs .",
    "the formalism can also be applied to the nucleon transition form factors to other baryons .",
    "these points will be addressed separately .",
