    "this paper concerns the classical ground states of the heisenberg hamiltonian on the pyrochlore lattice , a non - bravais lattice made of corner - sharing tetrahedra . in this paper",
    "we focus our analysis on the case of first and second nearest neighbor interactions @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and we briefly mention some results that include the effects of third nearest neighbor interactions @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "( each site on the pyrochlore lattice has two distinct kinds of third nearest neighbor , at the same separation , yet inequivalent by symmetry  having distinct neighbors at the same distances appears to be universal in non - bravais lattices . )",
    "an important motivation to work out the phase diagram of magnetic systems is the inverse problem arising from neutron diffraction : not the crystallographic problem of fitting the magnetic structure from the measured bragg intensities , but rather the physical problem of inferring  in the absence of magnon dispersion relations that would require dynamic neutron scattering  for what possible interactions is the observed structure the ground state .",
    "( one motivation for this project was the puzzle presented in ref .",
    "@xcite in geni@xmath7o@xmath8 , where it was necessary to posit interactions as far as @xmath9 . )",
    "the other motivation is to facilitate the theorists pursuit of model systems with unusual properties .",
    "for example , whenever frustrated magnets have a large number of degenerate ground states , quantum or thermal fluctuations , or dilution , can select a particular ground state  a form of so - called `` ordering due to disorder ''  @xcite .",
    "thus , one interest in our study is to identify parameter combinations on the phase diagram that lead to such degeneracies .",
    "this tends to happen along `` degenerate phase boundaries '' ( see ref .  , sections ii c and vii ) : their property is that one gets two limiting states depending on which side of the boundary the limit is taken from , yet it is possible to continuously turn one of these into the other within the manifold of degenerate states that exists on the boundary .",
    "another special property , which we are particularly concerned with in this paper , is inherently _ non - coplanar _ states .",
    "these can produce an _ anomalous hall effect _ due to berry phases of itinerant electrons @xcite ; they open up possibilities of _ multiferroic _ behavior  @xcite ; they turn into _ chiral _ spin liquids if spin order is destroyed ; and their symmetry - breaking leads to an order parameter in the form of an @xmath10 matrix , which allows unusual topological defects ( @xmath11 vortex and @xmath11 domain wall  @xcite ) .",
    "the pyrochlore spin lattice represents many antiferromagnets in any of three well - known crystal structures : the b sites of the spinel structure , one cation sublattice ( of the two equivalent ones ) in the pyrochlore structure ; or the sublattice of small atoms in the ( metallic ) laves phase structure .",
    "it is highly degenerate when only the nearest - neighbor interaction is included ; in studies where other terms were added that break the degeneracy , surprisingly few of them added farther - neighbor coupling ( apart from dipolar spin ice  @xcite ) .",
    "instead , anisotropies were added such as local easy planes  @xcite or dzyaloshinskii - moriya anisotropic exchange  @xcite . alternatively , lattice distortions were considered  @xcite .    in the case of the pyrochlore , ref .",
    "@xcite worked out ( in effect ) the optimum luttinger - tisza modes for general hamiltonians with @xmath3 up to @xmath9 , but limited to @xmath12 .",
    "the main systematic exploration to date has been of the @xmath13 pyrochlore [ or the @xmath14 case , which is equivalent to the @xmath13 case so long as @xmath3 is large and antiferromagnetic in sign ] .",
    "it uncovered a multiple - wavevector , not quite commensurate state with especially soft fluctuations @xcite that is not quite fully understood .",
    "another context in which farther neighbor couplings naturally arise is in metallic pyrochlores , in the form of electron - mediated r.k.k.y .",
    "exchange interactions ( that oscillate and decay with separation as a power law ) .",
    "in this section we describe the pyrochlore lattice and we also explain the methods and diagnostics we used to generate and analyze the spin configurations .",
    "we present a number of ways of visualizing the pyrochlore lattice , as certain ways of thinking about the structure of the pyrochlore lattice are helpful for understanding certain spin configurations .",
    "we also discuss the iterative minimization algorithm , our main method of generating spin configurations .",
    "finally we discuss a number of ways of understanding and interpreting the results of the iterative minimization simulation , including the luttinger - tisza method , numerical fourier transforms , least square fits and variational optimization .",
    "the pyrochlore lattice consists of four face - centered cubic ( f.c.c . )",
    "sublattices , numbered 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 .",
    "we take the edge - length of the cubic unit cell of each f.c.c .",
    "sublattice to be one .",
    "we choose the origins of these four f.c.c .",
    "sublattices to be located at @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "alternately , the pyrochlore lattice can be viewed as an abc stacking of triangular and kagome lattice layers along a @xmath0 direction in real space as in figure [ fig : kagtriangle ] .",
    "the picture shows one ( black ) kagome lattice layer sandwiched between an upper ( red ) triangular lattice layer and a lower ( blue ) triangular lattice layer.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ] [ fig : kagtriangle ]    our hamiltonian is = -_i=1^n_jij_ijs_is_j  , [ heisham ] the @xmath19 are classical 3-component unit vectors which sit on the sites @xmath20 of the pyrochlore lattice .",
    "the lattice contains @xmath21 sites .",
    "a positive ( negative ) @xmath22 represents a ferromagnetic ( antiferromagnetic ) interaction between the spins @xmath19 and @xmath23 . since the interaction @xmath22 is a function of the displacement vector @xmath24 between the spins @xmath19 and @xmath23 ,",
    "we can write @xmath25 .    each site on the pyrochlore lattice has six first nearest neighbors , 12 second nearest neighbors and 12 third nearest neighbors , but the third nearest neighbors come in two kinds , and each site has six of each kind .",
    "first nearest neighbors have an interaction @xmath3 , second nearest neighbors have an interaction @xmath4 , third nearest neighbors of the first kind have an interaction @xmath5 and third nearest neighbors of the second kind have an interaction @xmath6 .",
    "from now on we refer to first nearest neighbors as  @xmath3 neighbors \" , second nearest neighbors as  @xmath4 neighbors \" , etc .    the @xmath3 neighbors of a site can be reached by traveling along one edge of a tetrahedron .",
    "the @xmath4 neighbors of a site can be reached by traveling along two non - collinear edges of two adjacent tetrahedra .",
    "the @xmath5 neighbors of a site can be reached by traveling along two collinear edges of two adjacent tetrahedra .",
    "finally , the @xmath6 neighbors of a site can be reached by hopping across a hexagon in the kagome lattice layers .",
    "the two kinds of third nearest neighbors are obviously inequivalent by symmetry since every two @xmath5 neighbors have a spin lying halfway between them on the line connecting them , while there is no spin lying on the line connecting two @xmath6 neighbors .",
    "in this rest of this paper we limit our study to @xmath3 and @xmath4 , except that @xmath5 and @xmath6 are used in section  [ cs ] and appendix  [ acs ] , and @xmath5 is mentioned in section  [ qequals0 ] .",
    "the luttinger - tisza method  @xcite is a method for finding the ordering wavevector that characterizes the lowest energy state of for a given set of interactions @xmath22 .",
    "recall that the goal of any method ( analytical or computational ) for finding the ground states of is to find the set of @xmath21 spins @xmath26 which minimize the total energy subject to the constraint that all of the spins have unit length , i.e. @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 .",
    "the constraint that all of the spins have unit length is often called the _",
    "strong constraint_.    the luttinger - tisza method attempts to accomplish this by instead trying to minimize subject to what is known as the _ weak constraint _ , _ i|s_i|^2 = n  . [ wc ]    by formulating the problem in terms of the fourier transforms of the spin configuration in each bravais sublattice , one can obtain a lower bound on the energy of the true ground state .",
    "one then searches for a solution to the weak constraint problem which is composed solely of modes related by the symmetry of the underlying bravais lattice . in an ideal situation",
    "we would be able to find a solution to the weak constraint problem that also satisfies the strong constraint , is composed solely of modes related by the symmetry of the underlying bravais lattice , and has an energy equal to the lower bound .",
    "if such a configuration could be found , it would rigorously be the ground state .    to formulate the method we first rewrite equation in a way which clearly shows which spins are in which bravais sublattice .",
    "we use the notation @xmath30 to indicate which bravais sublattice spin @xmath29 belongs to , so the possible values for @xmath30 are 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 in our case .",
    "when it is convenient we will also write @xmath31 to indicate that spin @xmath19 is located in the @xmath32 bravais sublattice . from here on",
    "we specialize to the case of the pyrochlore lattice , which has four f.c.c .",
    ". then we can write j_ij j_(i)(j)(r_ij ) [ jijlt ] where @xmath33 is the interaction between spins in f.c.c",
    ". sublattices @xmath34 and @xmath35 that are separated by a vector @xmath36 .",

    "lattice and @xmath38 is the number of spins in each f.c.c .",
    "the inverse transform is s_i = _ q e^iqr_i _ ( i)(q )  . substituting this into yields the result = -_q _ , ^(q)_(q)_(-q )  .",
    "[ heisq ]    the coefficients of the quadratic form form a @xmath39 matrix @xmath40 with matrix elements _ ( q )",

    "[ ltelements ] let @xmath41 be the four eigenvalues of this matrix at wavevector @xmath37 , each with a normalized eigenvector @xmath42 , where @xmath43 runs over the four sublattices .",
    "these modes , transformed back to the actual lattice as @xmath44 , are exactly analogous to the bloch wavefunction for the @xmath45 band .",
    "express the spin configuration in terms of these eigenmodes : _",
    "( q ) = _ _ u^_(q ) , so the coefficients have three carteisan components for spin .",
    "the total energy is then = -_q__(q )     let @xmath46 be largest eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath40 and let @xmath47 be a wavevector that maximizes @xmath46 ( generically there is a star of symmetry - related wavevectors with magnitude @xmath48 that all do this ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath49 is called the optimal luttinger - tisza eigenvalue , and @xmath47 is the optimal luttinger - tisza wavevector .",
    "we refer to @xmath50 as the luttinger - tisza matrix .    in fourier space",
    "the weak constraint becomes @xmath51 so the ground state energy manifestly satisfies the inequality -n_l.t.[ebound ]  .",
    "a necessary condition for achieving this minimum is that the three components of @xmath52 be linear combinations of the luttinger - tisza eigenmodes @xmath53 .",
    "the luttinger - tisza method works if one can find a normalized spin configuration composed solely of eigenmodes of @xmath47 ( and symmetry - related wavevectors ) which also achieves the lower bound on the energy , @xmath54 . on non - bravais lattices , it is not always possible to construct a normalized state using only luttinger - tisza eigenmodes .",
    "many states require admixtures of a set of suboptimal modes in order to achieve normalization @xcite .",
    "our experience working with the pyrochlore lattice confirms that this is true .",
    "the key difficulty with the luttinger - tisza method is to ensure @xmath55 for every site , when that is not generally the case for a luttinger - tisza eigenmode ( expressed in real space , where it appears as a plane wave with a certain weight on each sublattice ) .",
    "on bravais lattices , that _ is the case _ if the eigenmodes are written as complex plane waves @xmath56 ; from this we can always construct a ground state in the form of a coplanar spiral by using one component for the sine and another for the cosine  @xcite .",
    "since the optimal luttinger - tisza wavevectors typically occur in symmetry - related stars , a nontrivial degeneracy would be possible by taking linear combinations of two modes with different @xmath57 s from the same star ; however , since each mode requires two spin components , that is not possible with physical three - component spins .",
    "but whenever @xmath47 is",
    "half of a reciprocal lattice vector ( and thus lies on a special point of the brillouin zone boundary ) , we have @xmath58 .",
    "thus the plane - wave modes are _ real _ in this case , and we can combine up to three of them , associated with orthogonal spin directions , to construct continuous families of degenerate classical ground states .    for each set of couplings",
    "@xmath22 , we can calculate the optimal luttinger - tisza wavevector @xmath47 .",
    "this allows us to create a ",
    "luttinger - tisza phase diagram \" , showing in what domains of parameter space each kind of l.t .",
    "mode is optimal .",
    "phase diagram tells us the expected wavevector content of the ground state for a given set of couplings , but can not tell how those modes are combined to construct a normalized state , whether there are multiple degenerate ways to do so , or whether the actual ground state requires admixtures of suboptimal modes for normalization .",
    "so although the luttinger - tisza phase boundaries typically correspond closely to the real phase boundaries , the true phase diagram often has extra subdivisions that the lt phase diagram lacks , e.g. the three kawamura states ( which all use the same luttinger - tisza modes , with admixtures of suboptimal modes ) .      following ref .",
    ", our main method for finding the ground states of is the iterative minimization simulation , a numerical approach which starts with a random spin configuration and generates states with progressively lower energy , until the method converges to some ( local ) energy minimum .",
    "let us first define the local field @xmath59 to be minus the gradient of with respect to the components of spin @xmath29 ( analog of the force in a mechanical system ) : h_i - = _ ji j_ijs_j  . in any ground state , every spin must be aligned parallel to its local field .",
    "( if any spin were not , reorienting it along its local field would immediately lower the energy . )",
    "the method works in the following way .",
    "we start with @xmath21 spins on the pyrochlore lattice , all pointing in random directions .",
    "next we run a large loop , and on each iteration of the loop we pick @xmath21 spins at random ( one at a time ) and reorient them so that they point along their local field .    in our simulations",
    "we mostly work on a lattice that is an @xmath60 block of pyrochlore lattice unit cells ( where @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are integers ) with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we also have the capability to use twist boundary conditions , in which spins near a certain boundary of the lattice see their neighbors beyond that boundary twisted by an angle @xmath64 about a certain axis in spin space .",
    "once we have obtained a spin configuration using iterative minimization , we try to get a sense of the basic structure of the state using a few simple diagnostics .",
    "these are the site energy diagnostic , which gives a rough sense of the layout of the spin configuration in real space , the common - origin plot , which indicates which directions the spins are pointing in in spin space , and numerical fourier transforming , which gives the wavevector content of the state .",
    "finally , we use least square fits of the spin configuration to the wavevectors appearing in the numerical fourier transform to get an approximate parameterization for the ground state . for simpler states , we can then use the technique of variational optimization to determine the idealized values of the parameters appearing in our approximate parameterization of the state .",
    "( all of these except the site energy were introduced in ref .  . )",
    "we define the site energy of the spin @xmath19 to be _",
    "i= -_jij_ijs_is_j  .",
    "[ sitee ] the average of this quantity over all the spins in the lattice is the  energy per site \" and we denote it by @xmath65 . the total energy of the system can then be written as @xmath66 .",
    "we often find that spin configurations break up into sublattices in real space according to the site energy of the spins in those sublattices .",
    "sometimes these sublattices are the familiar four f.c.c .",
    "sublattices of the pyrochlore lattice , as in the cuboctahedral stack state ( see section [ cs ] ) , but sometimes the spin configuration breaks up into a more exotic set of sublattices , as in the kawamura sextuplet - q state ( see section [ kawamurasq ] ) .      once we have found a spin configuration using iterative minimization , we take fourier transforms of that spin configuration in each f.c.c .",
    "next we compute the spin structure factor in each f.c.c .",
    "sublattice to determine which wavevectors the configuration mostly consists of .",

    "sublattice . in practice",
    "we compute these fourier transforms one spin component at a time .",
    "we then examine @xmath67 for each f.c.c .",
    "sublattice ( here the square includes a sum over the three cartesian components from the spins , as well as real / imaginary parts from the fourier transform . )",
    "sorting these in order of decreasing weight identifies the main wavevectors that characterize the state , which can then be checked against the list of optimal luttinger - tisza wavevectors to help determine whether the spin configuration found from iterative minimization ought to be a ground state .      as in ref .",
    ", we use the common - origin plot to easily see which directions the spins point in spin space . to construct a common - origin plot using a spin configuration determined by iterative minimization",
    ", we simply plot all the spin vectors with their tails at the origin .",
    "this diagnostic lets us easily see which directions the spins point in , but it does nt give any information about how the spins are arranged on the lattice .",
    "one can also make common - origin plots using only a subset of the entire spin configuration .",
    "for example , we might make a common - origin plot using only spins in one of the f.c.c .",
    "sublattices . to give another example , in cases where the lattice sites break up into sublattices according to site energy ,",
    "we can make a common - origin plot using only spins with a certain site energy .",
    "making common - origin plots of subsets of spins like these is often very helpful for finding a symmetrical basis for spin space to rotate the spin configuration into .",
    "it is much easier to think of possible idealized forms for a ground state when the numerical spin configuration obtained from iterative minimization has been rotated into the most symmetrical basis for spin space .",
    "many of the ground states we find in iterative minimization simulations are quite complicated , owing to the fact that they contain small contributions from many wavevectors besides the optimal luttinger - tisza wavevectors . in cases like these , it is desirable to obtain an approximate parameterization of the ground state .",
    "this approximate parameterization can then be used to obtain a more complete understanding of the state . to find these approximate parameterizations",
    "we perform a least squares fit of the numerical spin configuration in each f.c.c .",
    "sublattice to sines and cosines of the optimal luttinger - tisza wavevectors .",
    "if the spin configuration is rotated into a symmetrical basis in spin space , then this method usually yields approximate parameterizations which reveal the main structure of the ground state .    when the least squares fit is simple enough ( i.e. it only involves one or two wavevectors ) , we can idealize the approximate parameterization into a guess for the closed - form parameterization of the ground state .",
    "usually this guess involves a number of unknown parameters ( e.g. wavevectors or cone - angles ) whose values we compute by analytically solving for the values of these parameters which minimize the energy of the idealized state .",
    "this procedure is known as  variational optimization \"  @xcite .    when we present parameterizations of spin configurations , we give a formula @xmath68 , which represents the spin configuration as a function of position in the @xmath32 f.c.c .",
    "we usually give the components of @xmath68 in a cartesian basis @xmath69 for spin space .",
    "some states , however , take on their simplest form when written in terms of a basis for spin space which rotates as one moves from site to site in real space .",
    "it is important to remember that the basis vectors for spin space have no special orientation relative to the crystal lattice , since equation is invariant under a uniform rotation of all the spins .      in this section",
    "we discuss a method for analyzing _ stacked _ and _ columnar _ states , in which the spin configuration is independent of one or two of the spatial coordinates , respectively , by projecting the lattice and interactions down onto an equivalent one or two - dimensional lattice .",
    "a _ stacked _ state is one in which there is a certain direction in real space , say @xmath70 , such that within every plane normal to @xmath71 , all the spins have the same direction .",
    "then we can project the three - dimensional lattice down onto an equivalent one - dimensional lattice ( as elaborated in ref .",
    ", section v b ) , in which each spin represents an entire plane of spins from the original three - dimensional lattice .",
    "the three - dimensional spin interactions are correspondingly projected to the one - dimensional chain : the interaction @xmath72 between @xmath19 and another spin @xmath23 in the chain , is the sum of all interactions between some particular spin that projects to @xmath19 and _ any _ spin in the plane that projects to @xmath23 .",
    "a _ columnar _ state is a state in which there is a certain direction @xmath73 , such that in any column of sites parallel to @xmath74 , all the spins point in the same direction . in this case",
    ", we can project the three - dimensional lattice and its interactions down onto an equivalent two - dimensional lattice , in which each spin represents an entire line of spins in the original three - dimensional lattice .",
    "similarly to the stacked case , the interaction between two spins @xmath19 and @xmath23 in this two - dimensional lattice is equal to the sum of all interactions in three dimensions between one spin in the preimage of @xmath19 and all spins in the preimage of @xmath23 .    if the result of an iterative minimization simulation is a _ stacked _ or _ columnar _ state , then we can make some progress towards understanding that state by projecting the lattice and interactions down onto a lower dimensional lattice .",
    "this lower dimensional problem is typically easier to analyze , and in cases where the lower dimensional lattice is a bravais lattice , we can immediately use the luttinger - tisza method to rigorously justify the ground state .",
    "if a _ stacked _ or _ columnar _ state is the ground state of the three - dimensional lattice , then it must also be the ground state of the lower dimensional lattice ( but the converse is not true ) .",
    "the mapping of stacked states was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite for the study of conic spiral states , which break up into a family of parallel planes such that the spin direction is uniform within each plane .",
    "the state can be optimal in three dimensions only if its projection is optimal on the one - dimensional lattice , but the converse is not true .",
    "( that is , a state might be optimal on the one - dimensional lattice , but in 3d another state that is not stacked in that way might have an even lower energy . )",
    "the one - dimensional lattice can have a non - coplanar ground state only if it is non - bravais lattice , i.e. only if the mapped sites are inequivalent by translation .",
    "thus , it appears that the parallel layers of spins in the three - dimensional lattice must be _",
    "unequal_. this happens in the octahedral lattice of ref .",
    "@xcite for ( 100 ) layers ; in the pyrochlore lattice the @xmath75 stacking consists of triangular - lattice linking layers , alternating with kagom - lattice layers that have three times as many spins .    in the case of the pyrochlore lattice , stacked states in which @xmath71 is a @xmath76 direction project onto a one - dimensional bravais lattice ; columnar states in which @xmath74 is a @xmath76 direction project onto the two - dimensional non - bravais lattice known as the checkerboard lattice  @xcite .",
    "states which are stacked along a @xmath0 direction project down onto a one - dimensional non - bravais lattice with a basis of two kinds of site , which are projected respectively from a triangular lattice layer of spins and a kagome lattice layer of spins .",

    "in this section we present a brief overview of our results .",
    "most of our work was dedicated to characterizing the ground states of for all possible combinations of first and second nearest neighbor interactions , culminating in the @xmath3-@xmath4 phase diagram .",
    "we also briefly explored a few ground states that include interactions beyond second nearest neighbors .",

    "region and the @xmath77 planar spiral region . in the region",
    "@xmath78 , @xmath79 the ground state is ferromagnetic ( section [ fm ] ) .",
    "this is true even in the case of a pure ferromagnetic @xmath3 interaction or a pure ferromagnetic @xmath4 interaction .",
    "the reason for this is that the @xmath3 and @xmath4 interactions act between spins in different f.c.c .",
    "sublattices , so they couple together all of the spins in the lattice .",
    "the ferromagnetic state extends into the @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , @xmath83 regions of the @xmath3-@xmath4 phase diagram , although it is quickly destabilized by the antiferromagnetic interactions found in those regions .",
    ".summary of the ground states found in the @xmath3-@xmath4 phase diagram .",

    "in conclusion , we have surveyed the full range of the phase diagram of classical ground states with nearest and second - nearest neighbor exchange couplings in the pyrochlore lattice ( figure  [ fig : phasediag ] and table  [ j1j2states ] ) .",
    "large swathes of the phase diagram ( roughly those in which @xmath148 ) are dominated by the ferromagnet or a relatively simple coplanar spiral phase , but with smaller @xmath149 values ( for either sign of @xmath3 ) , a zoo of complex non - coplanar phases were found .    in a similar study of the octahedral lattice , which formed the model for this",
    "one , three categories of non - coplanar state were identified , with only one or two examples of each on the octahedral lattice , and our results on the pyrochlore fit into the same categories .",
    "one generic category is an ideal luttinger - tisza state , in which three degenerate ordering vectors are matched with three spin directions to form a highly symmetric , already normalized state with no admixture of other modes needed . on the octahedral lattice",
    "these were the two cuboctahedral states ; our sole example on the pyrochlore is also cuboctahedral ( sec .",
    "the second category was multiple - wavevector commensurate states , dominated by a star of symmetry - related wavevectors but admixing others .",
    "on the octahedral lattice , the only example was the `` double - twist '' ; on the pyrochlore , we have found _ three _ representatives : the kawamura states ( sec .",
    "[ kawamurastates ] ) , a kind of double - twist state ( sec .",
    "[ doubletwist ] ) , and a `` multiply - modulated commensurate spiral '' ( m.m.c.s . ) state ( sec .",
    "[ mmcs ] ) .",
    "the third category was `` conic spirals '' which were stackings of layers with a uniform spin direction in each layer , which are built from two unrelated but nearly degenerate spin modes , one of them being generically incommensurate .",
    "being layered , these states can be optimized after projecting all interactions onto a one - dimensional `` chain lattice ''  @xcite , as we outlined in sec .",
    "[ sec : stacksandcolumns ] .",
    "a corollary is that if a non - coplanar state is forced , the layers must be inequivalent , which is indeed the case for the ( 111 ) layering in which we did find a conic spiral state ( appendix  [ acs ] ) in the pyrochlore lattice . in both the octahedral lattice and now in the pyrochlore lattice , it was difficult to stabilize a conic spiral using the first few neighbor couplings : in the pyrochlore @xmath5 and @xmath6 were needed .    when we examine the whole phase diagram , there seems to be a rough tendency that the wavevectors used for the @xmath13 ground state are the same as those used for @xmath150 ; for example , the double - twist state is diametrically opposite the kawamura state in figure  [ fig : phasediag ] and both use optimal wavevectors of type @xmath95 ; the @xmath151 antiferromagnet is opposite the ferromagnet which is ( of course ) also a @xmath151 state .",
    "there is a plausible reason for this trend .",
    "notice first that the matrix of @xmath22 s ( in real space ) has no diagonal terms , so its trace must be zero .",
    "the same must be true for its fourier transform , so the sum of the four eigenvalues of @xmath40 is zero at every wavevector .",
    "the optimum wavevector @xmath47 occurs at the point in the zone where one branch of the eigenvalue spectrum has its greatest positive excursion . necessarily ,",
    "the _ sum _ of the other three eigenvalues must have its greatest _ negative _ excursion at the same wavevector : not uncommonly , that will be the point of the single most negative excursion .",
    "but if we reverse the signs of all couplings , the l.t . matrix is the same except for a global sign , and the greatest negative excursion becomes the greatest positive one , i.e. the optimal mode .",

    "one can calculate the elements of this matrix using equation .",
    "the matrix is :    \\(q ) = j_1m_2 + j_2m_2 + j_3m_3 + j_3m_3 where    m_1 =    0 & ( ) & ( ) & ( ) + ( ) & 0 & ( ) & ( ) + ( ) & ( ) & 0 & ( ) + ( ) & ( ) & ( ) & 0    m_2 = 2    0 & ( ) ( ) & ( ) ( ) & ( ) ( ) + ( ) ( ) & 0 & ( ) ( ) & ( ) ( ) + ( ) ( ) & ( ) ( ) & 0 & ( ) ( ) + ( ) ( ) & ( ) ( ) & ( ) ( ) & 0    to concisely express the matrices that go with the two kinds of third nearest neighbor interaction , we introduce the condensed notation    c_xy & = & ( ) +     and a similar notation for cosine terms with arguments using @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",

    "secondly , only @xmath5 and @xmath6 terms appear on the diagonals since these are the only interactions that act between spins in the same f.c.c .",
    "the @xmath3 and @xmath4 interactions only act between sites in different f.c.c .",

    ", we find a new type of alternating conic spiral state when the magnitude of @xmath6 is much larger than the magnitudes of @xmath3 and @xmath5 .",
    "our state is distinct from the alternating conic spiral found in ref .   because the wavevector which controls the spiraling behavior is not parallel to the wavevector which controls the alternating behavior .",
    "this means that the component of the spins perpendicular to the conic axis spiral about that axis when you move in one direction in the lattice , and the component of the spins parallel to the conic axis alternates in sign when you move in a completely different direction in the lattice .",
    "this state is made up of two different wavevectors , @xmath156 and @xmath107 .",
    "the first wavevector @xmath156 controls the spiraling behavior and it is likely that @xmath156 does not have to be commensurate with the lattice ( as is the case for the spiraling wavevector in the @xmath77 planar spiral of section [ 100spiral ] ) .",

    "we can see from that the spins in f.c.c .",
    "sublattices 0 and 2 are performing alternating conic spirals , the spins in f.c.c .",

    "as @xmath6 is varied in this region , fourier transforms of the numerical spin configurations found in iterative minimization simulations still show large peaks near @xmath165 type wavevectors .",
