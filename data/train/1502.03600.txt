    "in this paper we continue our study of the instability of a steady inviscid flow in an annulus between two permeable rotating circular cylinders that had been started in ref .",
    "the basic flow has both radial and azimuthal components which are independent of the azimuthal angle @xmath0 and inversely proportional to the radial coordinate @xmath1 of the polar coordinates system @xmath2 with the origin at the common axis of the cylinders .",
    "the direction of the radial flow can be from the inner cylinder to the outer one ( the diverging flow ) or from the outer cylinder to the inner one ( the converging flow ) .",
    "it had been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that this flow can be unstable to small two - dimensional perturbations ( in the framework of the inviscid theory ) provided that the ratio of the azimuthal component of the velocity to its radial component is larger than a certain critical value .",
    "this two - dimensional instability is oscillatory , and the neutral modes represent azimuthal travelling waves .",
    "the main aim of the present study is to understand what happens if three - dimensional perturbations are allowed . in particular , we are interested to investigate whether the most unstable mode ( i.e. the mode that becomes unstable first when the azimuthal component of the velocity is increased from @xmath3 ) is two - dimensional or not , and to determine the axial wave number of the most unstable mode .",
    "the stability of viscous flows between permeable rotating cylinders with a radial flow had been studied by many authors @xcite .",
    "one of the main aims of these papers was to determine the effect of the radial flow on the stability of the circular couette - taylor flow to axisymmetric perturbations , and the general conclusion was that the radial flow affects the stability of the basic flow : both a converging radial flow and a sufficiently strong diverging flow have a stabilizing effect on the taylor instability , but when a divergent flow is weak , it has a destabilizing effect @xcite .",
    "however , it was not clear whether a radial flow itself can induce instability for flows which are stable without it .",
    "this question had been answered affirmatively by fujita , morimoto & okamoto @xcite and later by gallet , doering and spiegel @xcite who had demonstrated that a particular classes of viscous flows between porous rotating cylinders can be unstable to small two - dimensional perturbations .",
    "later it had been shown @xcite that both converging and diverging flows can be linearly unstable in the framework of the inviscid theory and that the instability persists if small viscosity is taken into account . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a two - dimensional viscous stability problem had been considered , and it had been shown that not only the particular classes of viscous steady flows considered in @xcite can be unstable to two - dimensional perturbations , but this is also true for a wide class of steady rotationally - symmetric viscous flows ( without any restriction on angular velocities of the cylinders and for both converging and diverging flows ) .",
    "a further development of the two - dimensional theory can be found in a recent paper by kerswell @xcite where , among other things , the effects of compressibility and nonlinearity have been considered .    in the inviscid theory , a purely azimuthal flow with the velocity inversely proportional to @xmath1 is stable not only to two - dimensional perturbations ( see , e.g , @xcite ) but also to three - dimensional perturbations ( this can be deduced from the sufficient condition for stability given by howard & gupta @xcite ) . in @xcite , it had shown that this stable flow becomes unstable to two - dimensional perturbations if a radial flow is added and that the instability occurs for an arbitrarily weak radial flow ( here ` weak ' means ` weak relative to the azimuthal flow ' ) .",
    "moreover , in the limit when the ratio of the radial component of the velocity to its azimuthal component is small , the instability becomes independent of the only geometric parameter of the problem - the ratio of the radii of the cylinders . it had also been observed that if the azimuthal component of the basic flow is zero , i.e. the flow is purely radial , then it is stable ( to two - dimensional perturbations ) .",
    "these facts indicate that the instability mechanism can not be explained in terms of known instabilities ( e.g. , such as shear flow instability or centrifugal instability ) .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of the unstable eigenmodes for weak radial flow shows that the limit when the radial component of the velocity goes to zero is a singular limit of the linear stability problem @xcite . adding a weak radial flow to a purely azimuthal one results in formation of an _ inviscid _ boundary layer near the inflow part of the boundary , and the new unstable eigenmodes ( that were absent in the purely azimuthal flow ) appear within this boundary layer .    in the present paper",
    ", we examine the effect of three - dimension perturbations on the inviscid stability properties of the basic flow . in particular",
    ", we rigorously prove that ( i ) the purely radial flow is stable to small three - dimensional perturbations and ( ii ) the basic flow , in which both the radial and azimuthal components of the velocity are nonzero , is always stable to axisymmetric perturbations .",
    "we also compute neutral curves on the plane of parameters of the problem , which demonstrate that , the most unstable mode is always two - dimensional .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we introduce basic equations and formulate the linear stability problem .",
    "section 3 contains a linear inviscid stability analysis of both the diverging and converging flows . in section 4 , the effect of viscosity is considered .",
    "discussion of the results is presented in section 5 .",
    "we consider three - dimensional inviscid incompressible flows in the gap between two concentric circular cylinders with radii @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the cylinders are permeable for the fluid and there is a constant volume flux @xmath7 ( per unit length along the common axis of the cylinders ) of the fluid through the gap ( the fluid is pumped into the gap at the inner cylinder and taken out at the outer one or _ vice versa _ ) .",
    "@xmath8 will be positive if the direction of the flow is from the inner cylinder to the outer one and negative if the flow direction is reversed .",
    "flows with positive and negative @xmath8 will be referred to as diverging and converging flows respectively .",
    "suppose that @xmath9 is taken as a length scale , @xmath10 as a time scale , @xmath11 as a scale for the velocity and @xmath12 for the pressure where @xmath13 is the fluid density .",
    "then the euler equations , written in non - dimensional variables , have the form @xmath14 here @xmath15 are the polar cylindrical coordinates , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the radial , azimuthal and axial components of the velocity and @xmath19 is the pressure .",
    "it is well - known that if the flow domain is bounded by impermeable walls , then one needs to impose the standard boundary condition of no normal velocity at the walls .",
    "this will guarantee that the the resulting initial boundary value problem for the euler equations is mathematically well - posed .",
    "what is less known is that if there is a non - zero flow of the fluid through the boundary , then not only the normal velocity must be given at the boundary , but some additional boundary conditions at the inflow part of the boundary must also be imposed .",
    "what conditions should be added is a subtle question and there are several answers that lead to mathematically correct initial boundary value problems ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we will use the boundary condition for the tangent component of the velocity , which at first approximation corresponds to the condition at a porous cylinder ( see @xcite ) and for which the corresponding mathematical problem is well - posed ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "another important reason for using this condition is that it is consistent with the vanishing viscosity limit for the navier - stokes equations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "more precisely , the solution of the euler equations with a normal velocity prescribed on the entire boundary of the flow domain and with a tangent velocity prescribed on the inflow part of the boundary represent the leading order term of the asymptotic expansion of the solution of the corresponding viscous problem in which all components of the velocity are given on the entire boundary .",
    "so , our boundary conditions are @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and either @xmath23 for the diverging flow ( @xmath24 ) or @xmath25 for the converging flow ( @xmath26 ) . in eqs .",

    "this means not only that the inviscid instability studied here persists if viscosity is taken into account , but also that the asymptotic theory works well for reynolds numbers which are not very high , and this , in turn , implies that the instability may be observed in real flows .",

    "we gave a rigorous proof of the facts that the purely radial diverging and converging flows are stable and that unstable modes can not be axisymmetric .",

    "we have also derived an asymptotic expansion of the corresponding viscous stability problem for @xmath156 , computed the first - order viscous correction to inviscid eigenvalues and compared the asymptotic results with numerically obtained viscous eigenvalues .",
    "this demonstrated that the asymptotic results give a very good approximation even for reynolds numbers that are not particularly high , such as @xmath181 , which suggests that the instability may be be observed in real flows .",
    "of course , precise conditions under which this instability will be dominating require a further study , and this is a subject of a continuing investigation .",
    "it is known that a purely azimuthal flow with the velocity inversely proportional to @xmath1 is stable to three - dimensional perturbations ( this follows from a sufficient condition for stability given in @xcite ) .",
    "the present paper shows that a purely radial flow is also stable to three - dimensional perturbations .",
    "these facts indicate that the physical mechanism of the instability must rely on some destabilising effect arising from the presence of both the radial and azimuthal components of the basic flow .",
    "it has been shown in our previous paper @xcite that if a small radial component is added to the purely azimuthal flow , it immediately becomes unstable for any value of the ratio of the radii of the cylinders , and the growth rate is proportional to the square root of the ratio of the radial component of the velocity to the azimuthal one .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of two - dimensional unstable eigenmodes in the limit of weak radial flow ( see @xcite ) shows that this limit is a singular limit of the linear stability problem . adding a weak radial flow to a purely azimuthal one results in formation of an _ inviscid _ boundary layer near the inflow part of the boundary , and the unstable eigenmodes are concentrated within this boundary layer .",
    "these facts suggest the following physical mechanism of the instability : in a purely azimuthal flow there are no unstable eigenmodes , but when we add a weak radial flow , this leads to appearance of new unstable eigenmodes ( which do not exist at all if there is no radial flow ) concentrated within a thin inviscid boundary layer near the inflow part of the boundary .",
    "this mechanism bears some resemblance to the tearing instability in the magnetohydrodynamics , where the unstable tearing mode appears when a small resistivity is taken into consideration ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the instability considered here is oscillatory .",
    "the two - dimensional neutral modes represent azimuthal travelling waves , while the three - dimensional ones are helical waves .",
    "an oscillatory instability and appearance of azimuthal and helical waves are also present in the couette - taylor flow between impermeable cylinders . in the couette - taylor flow , these waves are observed at moderate azimuthal reynolds numbers and are associated with viscous effects ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the results of the present paper show that , in the presence of a radial flow , azimuthal and helical waves may appear at arbitrarily large radial reynolds numbers , which means that these waves can be generated not only by fluid viscosity but also by a radial flow .",
    "this has a certain similarity with self - oscillations observed in numerical simulations of inviscid flows through a channel of finite length @xcite .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the effect a radial flow on the stability characteristics of the couette - taylor flow requires a further investigation which would take full account of the viscosity .",
    "a particularly interesting question that arises in this context is the relation between the instability studied here and the classical centrifugal instability that leads to the formation of the taylor vortices .",
    "here is an interesting paradox : in the inviscid theory , axisymmetric modes can not be unstable , but it is well known that the monotonic instability with respect to axisymmetric perturbation occurs in the couette - taylor flow with radial flow ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "our hypothesis is that the monotonic axisymmetric and oscillatory non - axisymmetric instabilities are well separated in the space of parameters of the problem .",
    "if this were so , it would mean that our instability can be observed experimentally .",
    "this , however , requires a further theoretical study and is a topic of a continuing investigation .",
    "the results presented here are mainly of theoretical interest .",
    "however , as was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , they may be relevant to astrophysical flows such as accretion discs ( see also refs .",

    "<S> then we show that both the diverging and converging flows are unstable with respect to non - axisymmetric three - dimensional perturbations provided that the ratio of the azimuthal component of the velocity to the radial one is sufficiently large . </S>",
    "<S> neutral curves in the space of parameters of the problem are computed and it is demonstrated that for any ratio of the radii of the cylinders , the most unstable modes ( corresponding to the smallest ratio of the azimuthal velocity to the radial one ) are the two - dimensional ones . we also consider the corresponding viscous stability problem and construct an asymptotic expansion of its solutions for large radial reynolds numbers . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the first - order viscous correction to inviscid eigenvalues and show that the asymptotic results give a good approximation to the viscous eigenvalues even for moderate values of radial reynolds number , which indicates that the instability may be observed in real flows .    * konstantin ilin and andrey morgulis * </S>"
