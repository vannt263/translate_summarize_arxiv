    "quantum entanglement is one of the most non - classical features in quantum mechanics and provides us a lot of applications . due to its variety of usages ,",
    "much attention has been shown , so far , for the quantification of entanglement and , thus , the concept of entanglement measure has been naturally arisen .",
    "_ concurrence _",
    "@xcite is one of the most well - known bipartite entanglement measures with an explicit formula for @xmath2-qubit system while there does not exist any analytic way of evaluation yet for the general case of higher - dimensional mixed states .",
    "another entanglement measure that can be considered as a dual to concurrence is the _ concurrence of assistance _ ( coa )  @xcite , and this can be interpreted as the maximal average concurrence that two parties in the bipartite system can locally prepare with the help of the third party who has the purification of the bipartite system .    in multipartite quantum system",
    ", there can be several inequivalent types of entanglement among the subsystems and the amount of entanglement with different types might not be directly comparable to each other . for @xmath3-qubit pure states , it is known that there are two inequivalent classes of genuine tripartite entangled states  @xcite ; one is the greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) class  @xcite , and the other one is the w - class  @xcite .",
    "this can be characterized by means of stochastic local operations and classical communication ( slocc ) , that is , the conversion of the states in a same class can be achieved through local operation and classical communication with non - zero probability .",
    "another way to characterize the different types of entanglement distribution is by using _",
    "monogamy relation _ of entanglement .",
    "unlike classical correlations , the amount of entanglement that can be shared between any of two parties and the others is strongly constrained by the entanglement between two parties .",
    "in @xmath3-qubit systems , coffman , kundu and wootters ( ckw )  @xcite first introduced a monogamy inequality in terms of a bipartite entanglement measure , concurrence , as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the concurrence of a 3-qubit state @xmath6 for a bipartite cut of subsystems between @xmath7 and @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "its generalization into @xmath0-qubit case was also proved  @xcite and , symmetrically , its dual inequality in terms of the coa for 3-qubit states , @xmath10 and its generalization into @xmath0-qubit cases have been shown in  @xcite .    in @xmath3-qubit system , two inequivalent classes of genuine tripartite entangled states , ghz and w classes , show extreme difference in terms of ckw inequality and its dual one . in other words ,",
    "ckw inequality is saturated by w - class states , while it becomes the most strict inequality with the states in ghz class . here , w - class states are of our special interest , since the saturation of the inequality implies that a genuine tripartite entanglement can have a complete characterization by means of the bipartite ones inside it . in other words ,",
    "the entanglement @xmath7-@xmath8 , measured by concurrence , is completely determined by its partial entanglements , @xmath7-@xmath11 and @xmath7-@xmath12 . for the case of @xmath0-qubit w - class states , generalized ckw and its dual inequalities",
    "are also saturated , and thus the same interpretation can be applied . in this paper , we generalized the concept of w - class states from @xmath0 qubits to @xmath0 qudits and show that their entanglement is fully characterized by their partial entanglements .",
    "we also prove that the complete characterization of the global entanglement in terms of its partial entanglement is possible even for the case of the mixture consisting of a w - class state and a product state @xmath1 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : nw ] we recall the the monogamy relation of @xmath0-qubit w - class states in terms of ckw and its dual inequalities . in section  [ structure ] , we provide more general monogamy relations of @xmath0-qubit w - class states with respect to arbitrary partitions by investigating the structure of @xmath0-qubit w - class states . in section  [ subsec : ndw ]",
    "we generalize the concept of w - class states to arbitrary @xmath0-qudit system as well as its monogamy relations with respect to arbitrary partitions . in section  [ sec : mixed ] , we consider the class of multipartite mixed states that is a mixture of a w - class state and a product state .",
    "we also provide its monogamy relations in terms of its partial entanglement by studying its structural properties . in section",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] we summarize our results .",
    "for any bipartite pure state @xmath13 , concurrence of @xmath14 is defined as @xmath15 where @xmath16 . for any mixed state @xmath17 ,",
    "it is defined as @xmath18 where the minimum is taken over its all possible pure state decompositions , @xmath19 .",
    "another entanglement measure that can be considered as a dual to concurrence is coa  @xcite , which is defined as @xmath20 where the maximum is taken over all possible decompositions of @xmath17 .    for @xmath3-qubit w - class states",
    "@xmath21 with @xmath22 , ckw and its dual inequalities ( [ ckw ] ) , ( [ dual ] ) are saturated , that is , @xmath23    in other words , the entanglement of w - class states between one party and the rest can have a complete characterization in terms of the @xmath24 that is the bipartite entanglement between one party and each of the rest parties .    for @xmath0-qubit systems @xmath25 where @xmath26 for @xmath27 , ckw and its dual inequalities can be generalized as  @xcite @xmath28 for @xmath0-qubit w - class states , @xmath29 the inequalities ( [ nckw ] ) are saturated ;",
    "that is , @xmath30",
    "in fact , there can be several ways to show equation  ( [ nsatu ] ) . since any two - qubit reduced density matrix @xmath31 of @xmath32 can have analytic formulas for concurrence and concurrence of assistance  @xcite ,",
    "one of the ways to check equalities ( [ nsatu ] ) is using the formulas in  @xcite .",
    "however , there is no formula for the general case of a bipartite quantum state with arbitrary dimension , so here we use the method of considering all possible decompositions of the bipartite mixed state @xmath31 so that the optimization process in ( [ eq : concurrence ] ,  [ eq : coa ] ) can also be used later in this paper for higher - dimensional quantum systems .",
    "let us first consider @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",

    "this implies @xmath59 which leads to ( [ nsatu ] ) .",
    "in section  [ sec : nw ] , we have seen the monogamy relations of @xmath0-qubit w - class states between subsystems in terms of ckw and its dual inequalities . here , we investigate the structure of w - class states in @xmath0-qubit system by considering arbitrary partitions of subsystems and derive more general concept of monogamy relations between the parties .",
    "furthermore , we generalize the concept of w - class states to arbitrary @xmath0-qudit system and also consider the monogamy relations in terms of arbitrary partitions .      for @xmath0-qubit w - class states ,",
    "@xmath60 let us consider a partition @xmath61 , @xmath62 for the set of subsystems @xmath63 where each of @xmath64 contains several qubits , that is , @xmath65     where @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68.,title=\"fig:\",width=453 ] +    for simplicity , let us first consider the case when @xmath69 with @xmath70 where @xmath71 .",

    "concurrence is one of most well - known entanglement measures for bipartite quantum system with an explicit formula for @xmath2-qubit system .",
    "however , in higher - dimensional quantum system , there does not exist any explicit way of evaluation yet for mixed state .",
    "the lack of an analytic evaluation technique is mostly due to the difficulty of optimization problem which is minimizing over all possible pure state decompositions of the given mixed state .",
    "the difficulty of optimization problem for its dual , coa , also arises in forms of maximization .",
    "recently , the optimal pure state decomposition for the mixture of generalized ghz and w states in @xmath3-qubit system was found  @xcite , and the optimal decomposition , here , was assured by the saturation of ckw inequality . in  @xcite , another monogamy relation in terms of the higher - tangle , the squared concurrence of pure states and its convex - roof extension for mixed states , was also investigated for a mixture of @xmath0-qubit w - class state and a product state @xmath1 .    here",

    "if @xmath193 , theorem  [ thm : dwclass ] deals with the monogamy relations of @xmath0-qudit w - class states that were presented in lemma  [ lem : dwclass ] , and for the case @xmath194 , it is about the monogamy relations of @xmath0-qubit w - class states that were presented in lemma  [ lem : wclass ] .",
    "thus , theorem  [ thm : dwclass ] deals with the most general case of high - dimensional multipartite mixed states , so far , whose entanglement is completely characterized by their partial entanglements .",

    "our novel technique can also be helpful to study the structural properties of other genuine multipartite entangled states , such as @xmath0-qudit ghz - class states and cluster states  @xcite . noting the importance of the study on high - dimensional multipartite entanglement ,",
