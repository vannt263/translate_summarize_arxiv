    "gravitational field of an object acts as a gravitational lens which deviates light path of a collinear background source and produces distorted images @xcite . in galactic scale , the angular separation of the images is of order of milli - acrsecond that is too small to be resolved even by the most modern telescopes . instead , the combined light of images received by an observer is magnified in comparison to the un - lensed source .",
    "this phenomenon is called gravitational microlensing which was proposed as a method to probe dark objects in galactic halo , extra solar planets , study stellar atmosphere , etc.@xcite .",
    "one of features of gravitational microlensing is the deviation of the light centroid of the source star images from the source star position . for the case of a point - mass lens ,",
    "the centroid shift of source star images traces an ellipse in the lens plane while the source star is passing an straightforward line in the lens plane @xcite .",
    "in contrast with the magnification factor which is a dimensionless scalar , the light centroid shift of the source star images is a dimensional vector and its size is proportional to angular einstein radius , i.e. the angular radius of images ring when observer , source and lens are completely aligned . for a stellar - mass lens ,",
    "the angular einstein radius is a few hundreds micro - arcsecond , too small to be observed directly .",
    "however , its quantity enhances in two cases : ( i ) when the lens mass is high , e.g. a stellar - mass black hole as microlens and ( ii ) when the lens is very close to the observer .",
    "the light centroid shift of source star images in these microlensing events is measurable by high - precision interferometers e.g. very large telescope interferometry ( vlti ) or the hst @xcite .",
    "an important future project is gaia , performing high precision astrometry , which will be operational in near future @xcite .    during a microlensing event by measuring the astrometric lensing and parallax effects",
    ", the mass of the deflector can be inferred without knowing the exact distances of the lens and the source from the observer @xcite .",
    "also the degeneracy in close / wide caustic - crossing binary microlensing events @xcite can be removed by astrometric measurements @xcite .",
    "the two configurations of the lens and source produce different astrometric trajectories even though they might present the same light curves .",
    "hence , by measuring the astrometric trajectories this degeneracy can be removed @xcite .    generally , there are some anomalies in microlensing events which deviate the observed light curve and astrometric trajectory of source star from the standard model .",
    "some deviations owing to these anomalies help obtain extra information about lens and source and thus resolve degeneracy .",
    "one of them is the effect of lens orbital motion in a binary microlensing event . in this case",
    "two components in a gravitationally bound binary system which act as lens rotate around their common center of mass . as a result , their orientation changes as a microlensing event progress and the resulting light curve is different from that due to a static binary microlens .",
    "the ratio of the einstein crossing time to the orbital period of lens system is considered as a criterion which indicates the probability of detecting the orbital motion in the microlensing light curve @xcite .",
    "measuring this effect gives information about the orbit of microlenses system which in turn helps to resolve the close / wide degeneracy @xcite .",
    "detectability of orbital motion in light curves of binary microlensing events was investigated extensively by penny et al .",
    "( 2011 ) whereas the relevant deviation in the astrometric trajectory of source star and its detectability are not clear yet .",
    "in this work , we study lens orbital motion in astrometric microlensing and its detectability .",
    "in microlensing events , the astrometric trajectory of source star tends to zero much more slowly than the light amplification as the source distance from the lens position rises . as a result , perturbations enlarged with time such as lens orbital motion can produce considerable deviations in the astrometric trajectories . since the astrometric cross - section is much larger than the photometric one , so the rotation in the source trajectory owing to the orbital motion is more probable to be detected in the astrometric trajectory than the photometric light curve .",
    "however , depending on the size of the angular einstein radius this effect can be detected .",
    "we find that , among binary microlensing events with detectable astrometric trajectories , those with rotating stellar - mass black holes have most likely detectable astrometric signatures of orbital motion .",
    "for these binary microlensing events , we evaluate the efficiency of detecting orbital motion in astrometric trajectories and photometric light curves by performing monte carlo simulation .",
    "detecting lens orbital motion in their astrometric trajectories helps to discover even secondary components with no photometric binarity signatures as well as resolve close / wide degeneracy .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ( [ one ] ) the effect of orbital motion in binary microlensing events are explained .",
    "we next describe astrometric properties of microlensing events and finally we investigate the orbital motion effect on the astrometric trajectories . in the next section by preforming a monte carlo simulation we study the astrometric and photometric efficiencies for detecting lens orbital motion . in section ( [ result ] )",
    "we explain the results .",
    "in this section we first study the orbital motion effect in binary microlensing events .",
    "having reviewed the astrometric microlensing , we investigate the microlensing events with detectable astrometric shifts in source trajectories .",
    "finally , we study whether the orbital motion effect in the astrometric trajectories is detectable .",
    "dominik ( 1998 ) first studied the effect of lens orbital motion in binary microlensing events and concluded that in the most microlensing events this effect is ignorable , but in some long - duration microlensing events can probably be observed .",
    "orbital motion effects on the planetary signals in high - magnification microlensing events was investigated by rattenbury et al .",
    "recently , penny et al . (",
    "2012 ) indicated how fraction of binary and planetary microlensing events exhibit the orbital motion effects in their light curves by performing monte carlo simulation and investigated those factors which change this fraction .",
    "until now , several observed microlensing events have shown the signatures of lens orbital motion . in some cases ,",
    "these signatures have allowed to infer some of orbital parameters and remove the close / wide degeneracy @xcite . sometimes , there are several degenerate best - fitting solutions for orbital motion modeling .",
    "three systems with complete orbital solutions have been found , e.g. the microlensing event ogle-2011-blg-0417 @xcite .",
    "however , one of these solutions can actually be checked with radial velocity method @xcite . in the following",
    "we study the orbital motion effect in microlensing light curves in the same way as dominik s approach .",
    "let us consider a gravitationally bound system as microlens . under the gravitational effect ,",
    "the secondary component with respect to the first one traces out an ellipse one of whose focus is at the center of mass position .",
    "two components of their relative distance are given by : @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 axes are along the semi - major and semi - minor axes , @xmath5 is the eccentricity , @xmath6 is the semi - major axis and @xmath7 is a periodic function with time which for a small eccentricity and up to its first order is estimated as : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the time of arriving at the perihelion point of orbit , @xmath10 is the orbital period of the lenses motion . to study the orbital motion of lenses on microlensing light curves , we should project the orbit plane of lenses into the sky plane . in that case , we need to two consecutive rotation angles : @xmath11 around @xmath3-axis and @xmath12 around @xmath4-axis .",
    "the projected components of the relative position vector of the second one with respect to the first , in the sky plane normalized to the einstein radius are : @xmath13 \\nonumber\\\\ x_{2}(t)&=&\\rho\\cos\\beta\\sqrt{1-\\varepsilon^2}\\sin\\xi(t),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the normalized semi - major axis to the einstein radius @xcite .",
    "hence , lens orbital motion causes the projected distance between two lenses in the lens plane changes with time which is given by : @xmath15 on the other hand , the binary axis with respect to the projected source trajectory rotates with angle @xmath16 .",
    "so , during a microlensing event with binary rotating lenses , the source trajectory rotates with respect to the binary axis with angle @xmath17 around the line of sight towards the observer . however , this rotation is not always detectable in the observer reference frame .",
    "the signature of lens orbital motion in the microlensing light curves is not always observable and its detectability depends strongly on the ratio of the lensing characteristic time to the orbital period of lenses motion . dominik ( 1998 ) considered the einstein crossing time as the characteristic time of a binary microlensing event to evaluate the orbital motion detectability .",
    "however , the orbital motion detection efficiency for binary microlensing events without caustic - crossing features is too small and of order of one per cent @xcite . as a result",
    ", we consider the effective time scale for detecting signatures of lens orbital motion as @xmath18 instead of the einstein crossing time , where @xmath19 refers to the average over the ratios of the lengths of the source trajectories providing the sources are inside the caustic curve to the total length of the source trajectories .",
    "we assume that there are several parallel source trajectories over the lens plane with the same lengths i.e. @xmath20 so that they cover the caustic curve . in this case",
    ", @xmath19 is given by : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the length of the portion of @xmath23th source trajectory providing the source is inside the caustic curve , @xmath24 is the number of the source trajectories , @xmath25 is the normal distance between two consecutive source trajectories , @xmath26 is the projected distance between two lenses normalized to the einstein radius and @xmath27 is the ratio of the lens masses . according to equation ( [ ddq ] ) ,",
    "it is clear that @xmath19 is equal to the ratio of the area interior to the caustic curve to an area equal to @xmath28 i.e. @xmath29 . by considering this factor , the detectability of lens orbital motion can be characterized by the factor @xmath30 : @xmath31 the map of detectability factor @xmath30 is shown in figure ( [ fig1 ] ) in the parameter space of lenses containing the total mass of lenses @xmath32 and semi - major axis @xmath33 .    in this figure",
    "the black dashed and solid lines represent the threshold values between the close - intermediate ( or resonance ) and intermediate - wide binaries respectively . for calculating the inner area of caustics ,",
    "we first determine the caustic points which have so small determinant of jacobian matrix .",
    "then , after sorting the consecutive points on the caustic line we calculate the interior area of caustics numerically",
    ". the detectability factor has the highest amount for the intermediate microlensing events which locate near to the close - intermediate threshold line ( dashed line ) .",
    "however , gaudi ( 2012 ) intuitively pointed out that the resonance microlensing events according to their large sizes and cross - sections are more sensitive to the small changes in @xmath26 owing to lens orbital motion . according to this figure ,",
    "the orbital motion detectability in microlensing events with more massive lenses which have the same caustic curve , is larger than those with less massive lenses . for this plot , we consider @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "however , the smaller amounts of @xmath27 just move two threshold lines towards each other so that they mostly form close and wide binaries while the detectability factor is maximum for intermediate binaries similar to the plotted case .    in the following ,",
    "we explain the astrometric properties of microlensing and seek binary microlensing events which have detectable astrometric trajectories as well as very likely detectable orbital motion signatures .      in microlensing events",
    ", the light centroid vector of source star images does not coincide with the source position .",
    "this astrometric shift in source star position changes with time as a microlensing event progresses . for a point - mass lens , the centroid shift vector of source star images is given by : @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the position and magnification factor of @xmath23th image",
    ", @xmath41 is the vector of the projected angular position of the source star with respect to the lens normalized by the angular einstein radius of the lens @xmath42 in which @xmath43 , @xmath44 is the time of the closest approach , @xmath45 is the einstein crossing time , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the unit vectors in the directions parallel with and normal to the direction of the lens - source transverse motion .",
    "the angular einstein radius of lens is given by : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the lens mass , @xmath50 and @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the lens and source distances from the observer .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the second set @xmath55 which are characterized in the third row of table ( [ tab1 ] ) contains gravitational microlensing events in which the lens is so close to the sun , e.g. closer than @xmath56 parsec from the sun position .",
    "these stars are best candidates for the astrometric microlensing through gaia mission for accurately indicating their mass@xcite .",
    "owing to the small distance of the lens from the sun , their proper motion is so high and larger than @xmath57 arcsecond in year .",
    "these microlensing events are characterized by the einstein radius smaller than @xmath57au and einstein crossing time smaller than @xmath58days .",
    "let us assume that the lens is a binary system .",
    "in that case , most of these binary microlensing events are wide and a few of them are intermediate or close microlensing events in which the orbital motion effect of lenses is ignorable due to the too small ratio of the einstein crossing time to the orbital period and the finite - lens effect is probably considerable owing to the small einstein radius . note that , the finite - source effect is mostly ignorable because of the small amount of the relative distance of the lens to the source star from the observer i.e. @xmath59 .    hence , binary microlensing events with rotating stellar - mass black holes located in the galactic disk which have detectable astrometric shifts in the source star trajectories have most likely detectable orbital motion signatures ( case @xmath60 ) .",
    "in these events , the ratio of the einstein crossing time to the orbital period is high .",
    "if there is no caustic - crossing feature in their light curves , the photometric signature of orbital motion or even of the secondary lens is too small to be detected whereas the astrometric signature owing to the orbital motion can be detected in the astrometric trajectories which can show the existence of a secondary component . in this work",
    "we pay attention to these events owing to much probability of detecting astrometric signatures of orbital motion .      here , we study the astrometric microlensing due to rotating stellar - mass black holes .",
    "as mentioned , lens orbital motion changes the lenses orientation . as a result ,",
    "the magnification pattern changes with time owing to the time variation of the projected distance between two lenses as well as the straightforward source trajectory rotates with respect to the binary axis .",
    "however , source star does not always receive the gravitational effect of the secondary component , e.g. when the ratio of the lens masses is so small .",
    "in that case , the source trajectory does not change in the observer reference frame . considering this point",
    ", we let the lenses rotate around their common center of mass when the astrometric trajectory deviates more than  5 micro arcseconds from the astrometric ellipse due to a point - mass lens located at the center of mass position whose mass is equal to the total mass of the lenses . however , when this difference becomes smaller than the threshold amount , we stop the lenses rotation and let the source trajectory slowly return back to its straightforward trace .    in figure ( [ fig2 ] )",
    "we represent two examples of microlensing events with rotating stellar - mass black holes . in each subfigure ,",
    "the light curves ( left panels ) and astrometric trajectories ( right panels ) without and with considering the effect of lens orbital motion are shown with green dashed and blue dotted lines respectively .",

    "in this section we perform a monte carlo simulation to obtain quantitatively detectability of lens orbital motion in astrometric and photometric microlensing with rotating stellar - mass black holes . in the first step",
    ", we produce an ensemble of binary microlensing events with stellar - mass black holes as microlenses according to the physical distribution of parameters .",
    "then , corresponding light curves and astrometric trajectories are generated according to the real data points from an ensemble of observatories in the microlensing experiment . by considering a detectability criterion",

    ", the orbital motion of lenses rotates the astrometric trajectory in the same was as the source trajectory . depending on the size of the angular einstein radius",
    "this effect can be seen at sometime often after one einstein crossing time with respect to the time of the closest approach while this signal in the light curve can be detected at sometime almost before it .",
    "binary microlensing events with rotating stellar - mass black holes which have detectable astrometric shifts in the source star trajectories have most likely detectable orbital motion signatures . in these events ,",
    "the ratio of the einstein crossing time to the orbital period is high .",
    "although , orbital motion effect in their light curves is too small especially when there is no caustic - crossing feature , but the astrometric signature owing to the orbital motion can be detected at the end parts of astrometric trajectories .",
    "in addition , the hubble space telescope ( hst ) is observing some long - duration microlensing events which are likely to be owing to stellar - mass black holes , following the approved proposal by sahu et al .",
    "hence , we expect that if there is a secondary lens , the astrometric signature of its orbital motion can much probably be observed .",
    "by performing monte carlo simulation we evaluated the efficiency of detecting orbital motion in astrometric and photometric microlensing with binary stellar - mass black holes .",
    "we considered @xmath126 as the detectability criterion and concluded that astrometric efficiency is @xmath0 per cent whereas the photometric efficiency is @xmath1 per cent . from total simulated events",
    "@xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 per cent were close , intermediate and wide binaries respectively . also , the more massive lenses , the more detectable signatures of orbital motion .",
    "detecting orbital motion in binary microlensing events helps not only to detect further secondary components even without any photometric binarity signature but also to resolve close - wide degeneracy as well .    * acknowledgment * i am especially thankful to sohrab rahvar for his encouragement , useful discussions and reading of the manuscript .",
