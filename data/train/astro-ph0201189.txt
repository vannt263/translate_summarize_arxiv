    "@xcite argued that resonant scattering would suppress the original anisotropies by a factor of @xmath13 , but will generate new anisotropies in the cmb temperature and polarization on sub  degree scales primarily through the doppler effect .",

    "@xcite also investigated the lih post - recombination abundance , but neglected to give any details concerning the evolution of li and li@xmath16 .",
    "the first explicit results for the redshift dependent li and li@xmath16 abundances were presented by @xcite although no information was given on the adopted chemistry or reaction rate coefficients .",
    "their results , which varied little with the adopted cosmological model parameters , suggested that the neutral li formation redshift was @xmath17 ( which we define here as the redshift when the neutral abundance reaches 10% of the elemental abundance @xmath18 ) and that the li ionization fraction @xmath19(li@xmath16)/@xmath20 as @xmath21 .",
    "the significant residual li@xmath16 abundance , a result predicted by @xcite , is a consequence of the depletion of electrons following the cosmological recombination of hydrogen and helium .",

    "the small changes shown in figure  [ fig1 ] reflect the fact that the radiative recombination rate coefficients of vf96 are only about 5% larger than those determined by @xcite , which is however within the 10% accuracy claimed by vf96 .",
    "any differences in the rate coefficients of other processes result in only secondary effects as can be seen in figure  [ fig2 ] which displays both the formation and destruction rates ( multiplied by the neutral li fractional abundance @xmath34 ) of the dominant processes and their time scales ( per hubble time @xmath35 ) . for @xmath36 , the cmb field at temperatures @xmath37",

    "the numerical trends discussed above are evident in this relation in addition to dependencies on @xmath48 and @xmath80 .",
    "the shape of the optical depth curves arise from a competition between the increasing neutral li fraction @xmath81 and the expansion of the universe . as a consequence ,",
    "the possible effects of lithium on the cmb power spectrum are restricted to the epoch of @xmath82 .",
    "we have calculated the signatures of lithium resonant scattering on the cmb anisotropies following the methods described in @xcite . to isolate the effect of the scatterings we have kept all cosmological parameters fixed as we varied the optical depth . as a reference model we considered the standard lcdm model , @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 . ] and compared it with models having optical depths equal to those of models a , c and e of the previous section .    in figure [ fig5 ]",
    "we show the temperature anisotropy power spectra predicted for a wavelength of @xmath86 ( corresponding to scattering at a redshift @xmath15 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig6 ] we show the analogous plot for polarization .",
    "the effect of the scatterings increases as the optical depth increases , so they are the smallest in model a and the largest in model e. the changes are dominated by two contributions : ( i ) the doppler anisotropies induced at the sharp lithium scattering surface and ( ii ) the uniform @xmath87 suppression of the primary anisotropies which were generated at decoupling .    at large multipoles @xmath88 ( small angular scales ) , figure [ fig6 ] illustrates how the @xmath89 suppression of the anisotropies reduces the amplitude of power spectra by a factor @xmath90 .",
    "this effect leaves the shape of the power spectra unchanged . for the models under consideration the optical depth ranges from @xmath91 to @xmath92",
    "so on these scales the power spectra are suppressed by a factor between @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "as was discussed by @xcite , the doppler effect reaches a maximum on degree scales and is responsible for the change of shape of the power spectra on these scales .",
    "this effect can be noticed most dramatically in model e for the temperature and in both models c and e for the polarization .",
    "measurements of the cmb anisotropies at long photon wavelengths such as those that will be made by the _ map _ and _ planck _ satellites , will provide a baseline for comparison against which the effect of lithium could be extracted .",
    "these long wavelength maps , which are unaffected by the lithium scattering , can be compared with maps obtained at shorter wavelengths . in particular",
    "a useful statistic to study is the power spectra of the difference map ( see zaldarriaga & loeb 2001 for details ) .",
    "here we subtract the power spectra obtained at long wavelengths from that observed at 268.3  @xmath95 m , and consider the power spectrum of the residuals .",
    "the results for this statistic are presented in figure [ fig7 ] .",
    "figure [ fig7 ] indicates that the largest signal relative to the unperturbed spectra is expected in polarization at degree angular scales @xmath96 . in this range and for both models",

    "the resulting opacity to the 6708     resonant transition of neutral lithium ( figs .",
    "3 and 4 ) distorts both the temperature ( fig . 5 ) and polarization ( fig .",
    "6 ) power - spectra of the cmb anisotropies over a band of observed photon wavelengths around @xmath1 m .",
    "the distortion is most pronounced in model e which assumes a relatively high lithium abundance of @xmath97 .",
    "our detailed results agree with earlier estimates by loeb ( 2001 ) and zaldarriaga & loeb ( 2001 ) .",
    "the predicted polarization signal is comparable to the expected polarization anisotropies of the far - infrared background ( fib ; see zaldarriaga & loeb 2001 ) .",
    "a strategy for eliminating the contribution from the brightest fib sources would be helpful in isolating the lithium signal .    the relevant wavelength range overlaps with the highest frequency channel of the _ planck _ mission ( @xmath98 m ) , with the balloon  borne large  aperture sub",
    " millimeter telescope ( blast ) that will have @xmath99 and @xmath100 m channels and with the proposed balloon ",
    "borne explorer of diffuse galactic emissions ( edge ) that will survey 1% of the sky in 10 wavelength bands between @xmath101@xmath102 m with a resolution ranging from @xmath103 to @xmath104 ( see table 1 in knox et al .",
    "however , in order to optimize the detection of the lithium signature on the cmb anisotropies , a new instrument design is required with multiple narrow bands ( @xmath105 ) at various wavelengths in the range @xmath106@xmath107 m . the experiment should cover a sufficiently large area of the sky so as to determine reliably the statistics of fluctuations on degree scales , and the detector should be sensitive to polarization . for reference , the experiment should also measure the anisotropies at shorter wavelengths where the fib dominates .",
    "all of these requirements , of course , will make the detection of the lithium signature a difficult experiment .",
    "the difficulty can not be fully accessed until more is known about the fib and the sources responsible for it .",
    "some considerations and strategies are discussed in @xcite .",
    "further , in order to detect the effect of lithium , high signal - to - noise maps of the primordial cmb at long wavelengths should be made for the same region of the sky .",
    "fortunately , these maps will become available from future cmb missions such as the _ planck _ satellite .    on the theoretical front , improvements on the predicted lithium recombination history can be made by performing an explicit calculation of the non - equilibrium populations of the excited states in the same level - by - level fashion as that of the hydrogen recombination calculation of @xcite . for hydrogen",
    "it was found that the excited state levels were overpopulated for @xmath108 as the levels fall - out of equilibrium with the background radiation field . a slower photoionization rate coupled with faster cascade rates results in a faster net recombination rate ultimately resulting in a @xmath10910% change in the ionization fraction .",
    "@xcite also confirmed that all lyman transitions are optically thick during hydrogen recombination indicating that case b recombination holds at @xmath110 but not at lower redshifts .",
    "the optical depths computed here for lithium are less than one for the ground state transition suggesting that all other transitions should be optically thin , indicating case a recombination .",
    "the case a lithium equilibrium recombination rate coefficient of vf96 might result in an underestimation of the neutral lithium fraction ( and the optical depth ) , but probably only by @xmath111",
    ".    we also note that non - conventional recombination histories may have a substantial impact on our predicted signal .",
    "for example , it has recently been proposed that recombination could have been delayed by the presence of additional radiation at @xmath112 , possibly from stars , agns , or accretion by primordial compact objects @xcite .",
    "the neutral fraction of lithium ( and its optical depth ) could be larger than we calculated based on the standard recombination history , as the neutral lithium fraction is sensitive to the residual electron abundance .",
    "however , the stronger radiation field might override any gains in recombination of lithium due to the increase in its photoionization rate .",
    "models with detailed radiation fields are needed to calculate the net effect that these processes have on the lithium optical depth .    finally , while experiments to observe the lithium distortion on the temperature and polarization cmb power spectra appear to require redesign of detectors and new observational strategies , the benefits as mentioned in @xcite could potentially be significiant :    1 .",
    "if the lithium signal could be separated from the fib contamination , it would offer the possibility of constraining the lithium primordial abundance .",
    "inferring the lithium primordial abundance from stellar observations is known to be complicated by stellar lithium depletion and galactic lithium production .",
    "further , the lithium primordial abundance is a sensitive indicator of the baryon abundance , its mean value as well as inhomogenities .",
    "it would then provide a possible means to discriminate among big ",
    "bang nucleosynthesis models",
    "the lithium signature on the cmb anisotropies is the only probe proposed so far for structure in the dark ages of the early universe .",
    "other methods , such as the suggestion by @xcite that angular fluctuations in 21 cm emission from minihalos could probe redshifts between reionization and @xmath113 , rely on the existence of collapsed objects and do not reach the high redshifts ( @xmath114100 to @xmath115 ) probed by the lithium signal ( see review by barkana & loeb 2001 ) .",
    "the lithium and 21 cm signals would both give measures of the baryonic density fluctuations , the latter during the era of early star formation leading to reionization and the former just before the condensation of the first objects .",
