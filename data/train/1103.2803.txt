    "quantum state tomography @xcite is prone to errors , of various origins .",
    "for instance , samples might be small , the observables measured might not be informationally complete , or measurement devices might be inaccurate . in this letter ,",
    "i focus on one further source of systematic error : the quantum system might be coupled in an uncontrollable fashion to a heat bath of fixed but unknown temperature ( say , a piece of equipment or the surrounding air ) , whose effect may moreover vary randomly from sample to sample ( say , because the duration of interaction varies between different runs of the experiment ) .",
    "transient contact with the bath then triggers partial relaxation ( to varying extent ) of the system towards thermal equilibrium . in general , neither the original quantum state of the system nor the pertinent system - bath dynamics are known ; and so neither is the target equilibrium state , let alone the trajectory in state space leading from the original state towards the latter .",
    "under such adverse circumstances , how can one hope to learn anything about the original quantum state ? in this letter ,",
    "i provide a simple , approximate scheme that allows one at least to constrain the unknown quantum state to a one - dimensional submanifold of state space , based on the outcomes of multiple independent runs of the experiment .",
    "the reconstruction of this one - dimensional constraint manifold assumes a generic relaxation dynamics and uses the maximum likelihood approximation .",
    "in this section i first discuss the generic relaxation dynamics close to equilibrium and subsequently propose an extension to states further away .",
    "close to equilibrium , in the linear response regime , states typically relax towards equilibrium exponentially , @xmath0      , \\ ] ] on some pertinent time scale @xmath1 . here",
    "@xmath2 denotes the equilibrium state of the system . in the setting",
    "considered here , both @xmath1 and @xmath2 are fixed but unknown .",
    "the relaxation time @xmath1 should be larger than the typical contact times with the bath so that relaxation of the system towards equilibrium is only partial .",
    "such exponential relaxation can be regarded as a _ steepest - descent flow _ of the relative entropy @xmath3 , in the following sense .",
    "given any set of observables @xmath4 which is informationally complete , every state @xmath5 can be written in the gibbs form @xmath6      , \\label{gibbs}\\ ] ] with properly adjusted lagrange parameters @xmath7 and partition function @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "( this is not to be confused with a thermal state : a thermal state has the gibbs form , too , yet with only one observable ( hamiltonian ) and lagrange parameter ( inverse temperature ) in the exponent , and with @xmath2 replaced by the totally mixed state . )",
    "the lagrange parameters @xmath7 and the expectation values @xmath9 , respectively , constitute two possible choices for the coordinates in state space .",
    "associated with these coordinates are the respective basis vectors @xmath10 and @xmath11 , as well as their one - form duals @xmath12 and @xmath13 , related via @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the transformation from one coordinate basis to the other is effected by the correlation matrix @xmath15 , @xmath16 ( where i have adopted the convention that identical upper and lower indices are to be summed over ) , and likewise the transformation of their duals , @xmath17 being symmetric and positive , the correlation matrix also provides a natural riemannian metric on state space , the bogoliubov - kubo - mori ( bkm ) metric @xcite .",
    "its elements may be regarded as the components of the metric tensor @xmath18 the relative entropy @xmath3 has the gradient @xcite @xmath19 and so the pertinent steepest - descent curve ( in the bkm metric introduced above ) has a tangent vector @xmath20 consequently , on a steepest - descent trajectory the lagrange parameters must evolve according to @xmath21 and thus relax exponentially towards @xmath22 , which corresponds to the state @xmath2 . in the linear response regime ,",
    "exponential relaxation of the lagrange parameters in turn implies exponential relaxation of expectation values , and so indeed of the statistical operator , q.e.d .",
    "identifying thus the generic relaxation dynamics near equilibrium with a steepest - descent flow opens the possibility to formulate a generic dynamics even in regions further away : in the absence of detailed information about the system - bath dynamics , and regardless of how far the state of the system might be from equilibrium , i henceforth assume that the generic effect of a bath on the system is to move its state by some ( unknown ) distance along the steepest - descent trajectory towards some ( unknown ) equilibrium state @xmath2 .",
    "such an extension of the steepest - descent paradigm to full state space has been studied before , and in the special case of the classical fokker - planck equation ( with a particular choice of metric ) has been shown to reproduce the effective dynamics excactly @xcite . in the setting",
    "considered here , the steepest - descent algorithm induces an effective quantum operation on the state space of the system .",
    "close to equilibrium , this effective quantum operation is a completely positive map .",
    "further away from equilibrium , however , it might no longer be linear and thus not completely positive ; which suggests that , in contrast to a completely positive map , the steepest - descent ansatz may presume non - negligible initial correlations between system and bath .",
    "such initial correlations are not surprising in view of the fact that the properties of the heat bath are not known _ a priori _ ; they simply reflect the fact that learning something about the initial state of the system will entail learning something about the state of the bath , too .",
    "( there are also other reasons why one should expect the effective quantum dynamics to be nonlinear , see e.g. ref .",
    "it remains to be seen whether for a given steepest - descent flow there exists always some compatible microscopic system - bath dynamics , just as any completely positive map always arises from some underlying unitary evolution of the ( initially uncorrelated ) composite system - bath state .",
    "i conjecture that this is the case , but defer its proof to future work .",
    "any steepest - descent trajectory towards @xmath2 can be parametrized in the form @xmath23      , \\label{trajectory}\\ ] ] with some _ single _ observable @xmath24 and associated lagrange parameter @xmath25 .",
    "i prove this assertion in two steps : ( i ) any curve parametrized in this form is a steepest - descent curve towards @xmath2 ; and ( ii ) for every initial state @xmath26 there exists a curve of this form passing through it .",
    "the first statement becomes evident when one considers the above parametric form to be a special case of the more general form ( [ gibbs ] ) , with the pair @xmath27 being one of the informationally complete @xmath28 and the lagrange parameters associated with all @xmath29 equal to zero .",
    "if these other lagrange parameters are initially zero , they remain zero under the steepest - descent dynamics @xmath30 .",
    "so indeed , a curve parametrized as above describes a steepest descent towards @xmath2 . as for the second statement , for any initial @xmath26 ( except for states on the boundary of state space ) the choice @xmath31 will yield a steepest - descent curve passing through both @xmath26 ( at @xmath32 ) and @xmath2 ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "given @xmath26 and @xmath2 , this choice for @xmath24 is unique up to multiplicative and additive constants .    given the imperfect data from multiple runs of the experiment that have been affected ( to varying degree ) by uncontrolled contact of the system with the same unknown heat bath , a precise reconstruction of the original quantum state is clearly not possible .",
    "however , assuming that transient contact with the bath triggers a generic relaxation dynamics as described above , it is at least possible to constrain the original quantum state to some steepest - descent trajectory .",
    "having established the parametric form ( [ trajectory ] ) of such a trajectory , the task is then to infer from the available experimental data the observable @xmath24 ( up to multiplicative and additive constants ) as well as _ some _ state ( not necessarily the target state @xmath2 ) which lies on this trajectory .",
    "this is the inference task to which i turn in the next section .",
    "the experiment is run multiple times . in the @xmath34th run , after the supposed disturbance by the bath , one performs complete quantum state tomography on a sample of size @xmath35 and obtains the tomographic image @xmath36 .",
    "different runs of the experiment are disturbed by the same bath but to varying extent ( say , because the contact time varies between runs ) . as a result",
    ", the original quantum state is shifted on its relaxation trajectory towards equilibrium to varying degree ; and so rather than being clustered around a single point ( which would yield a unique state estimate ) , the images @xmath37 are expected to be spread out along this trajectory .",
    "assuming that the relaxation trajectory has the steepest - descent form ( [ trajectory ] ) , the problem of inferring the observable @xmath24 from images that correspond to various values of @xmath25 is analogous to the problem of estimating a hamiltonian from thermal data at various temperatures . assuming that the tomographic images are not too far apart , and expanding @xmath24 in terms of the informationally complete set @xmath4 , @xmath38 ( with the same index summation convention as above ) , the log - likelihood of observing the data @xmath37 is asymptotically ( i.e. , for sufficiently large sample sizes ) given by @xmath39      , \\label{xi_likelihood}\\ ] ] modulo additive terms that do not depend on @xmath40 or @xmath2 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath41 , and @xmath42 is the `` expectation value '' of the covariance matrix @xmath43 the latter in turn depends on the deviations of the sample means @xmath44 from their weighted averages @xmath45 , with the @xmath34th sample carrying relative weight @xmath46 .",
    "the correlation matrix @xmath47 is evaluated at the center of mass @xmath48 of the tomographic images . finally , the variations @xmath49 are given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the unique state of the form ( [ trajectory ] ) which yields @xmath52 .    unlike in the problem of estimating a hamiltonian from thermal data where @xmath2 corresponds to a given reference state , the target state @xmath2",
    "is not fixed _ a priori _ but is itself a variable to be inferred . to maximize the above log - likelihood as a function of both @xmath40 and @xmath2 ,",
    "the steepest - descent trajectory must maximize @xmath53 as well as render @xmath54 .",
    "the first requirement implies that @xmath55 must be the dominant eigenvector ( i.e. , the eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue ) of @xmath56 , the product of the inverse correlation and covariance matrices .",
    "such an eigenvector condition is a familiar result in principal component analysis @xcite . the second requirement , on the other hand",
    ", is met by any @xmath2 that ensures @xmath57 , and hence by any steepest - descent trajectory that passes through the center of mass @xmath58 .",
    "thus one can infer from the experimental data both a maximum likelihood estimate for @xmath55 , and hence for @xmath24 , and a state ( namely @xmath58 ) through which the steepest - descent trajectory must pass .",
    "together , these characterize the steepest - descent trajectory uniquely",
    ". the original quantum state of the system must lie somewhere on this trajectory .",
    "the simplest example is state tomography on an exchangeable sequence of qubits , emitted by some i.i.d .",
    "quantum source .",
    "the tomographic experiment is performed several times , with the @xmath34th run yielding the tomographic image @xmath36 . rather than isotropically around a point , these images @xmath37 turn out to be clustered along a curve in state space ; say , along a straight line parallel to the @xmath59 axis of the bloch sphere ( fig .",
    "[ qubit ] ) .",
    "this suggests that in between runs of the experiment , there is some uncontrolled change in the environment which is characterized by a single parameter .",
    "an obvious candidate is the coupling to an unknown heat bath , with the contact time fluctuating in between runs .    for a qubit , the informationally complete set of observables @xmath4",
    "can be taken to be the pauli matrices .",
    "the associated parameter vector @xmath55 points in the direction of the effective `` dissipative force '' which drives the qubit towards equilibrium . due to the nontrivial geometry of quantum states",
    "this force is in general _ not _ parallel to the spatial orientation of the data cluster ( here : the @xmath59 axis ) as one might navely expect .",
    "rather , it is tilted against this axis by some angle @xmath60 .",
    "this angle can be calculated as follows .",
    "assuming that the measured data are perfectly aligned parallel to the @xmath59 axis as shown in fig .",
    "[ qubit ] , all entries of the covariance matrix vanish except for @xmath61 . and for the center - of - mass state @xmath58 located in the @xmath62 plane as shown in fig .",
    "[ qubit ] , the inverse correlation matrix has the form @xmath63 the requirement that @xmath55 be the dominant eigenvector of @xmath56 then implies @xmath64 and @xmath65 . as a consequence , @xmath55 is tilted against the @xmath59 axis by the angle @xmath66",
    "this tilting angle vanishes whenever the center of mass lies on one of the two ( @xmath67 or @xmath59 ) axes .",
    "away from the axes , however , the tilting angle is non - zero , and increases as the center of mass moves closer to the surface of the bloch sphere . to illustrate the latter",
    ", i consider a center - of - mass state on the @xmath62 diagonal , with azimuth @xmath68 and variable bloch vector length @xmath69 .",
    "the relevant elements of the inverse correlation matrix are then @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "this yields a function @xmath72 which increases monotonically from @xmath73 to @xmath74 , and which to a reasonable degree of accuracy can be approximated by @xmath75 . only near the origin of the bloch sphere , therefore , and hence for highly mixed states , does the inferred direction of the effective dissipative force coincide with the `` nave '' estimate based on the spatial orientation of the data cluster . for states that are ( nearly ) pure , on the other hand ,",
    "the reconstruction scheme presented here may yield a direction @xmath55 which differs significantly from that nave estimate .    ) of the bloch sphere .",
    "the black dots indicate the tomographic images @xmath37 obtained in different runs of the experiment , and the small circle their center of mass @xmath58 .",
    "the bloch vector associated with the center of mass is assumed to have no @xmath76 component ( @xmath77 ) , azimuth @xmath68 , and length @xmath69 .",
    "even though the images are aligned parallel to the @xmath59 axis , the inferred direction @xmath55 of the effective force which drives the relaxation towards equilibrium is tilted against that axis by an angle @xmath60 .",
    "this angle grows from @xmath78 at @xmath79 to @xmath80 at @xmath81 .",
    ", width=340 ]",
    "whenever an i.i.d . sequence of quantum systems is subjected to disturbance by the same heat bath , yet to an extent that varies randomly between samples , multiple runs of quantum state tomography are expected to yield data spread out along a curve in state space . from the shape and location of this sprawl , one can infer the system s effective relaxation dynamics under the influence of the bath . owing to the nontrivial geometry of quantum states ,",
    "the result of this inference can be rather counterintuitive . in the qubit example",
    ", the inferred direction of the effective dissipative force generally deviated from the principal axis of the data cluster .",
    "there are several ways to extend the results of the present letter , which are left to future work .",
    "( i ) so far the reconstruction scheme for the effective relaxation dynamics does not take into account the prior distribution @xmath82 of its parameters .",
    "doing so will lead to a bayesian modification of the maximum likelihood framework presented here .",
    "a full bayesian analysis should also include a study of the error bars on @xmath40 and @xmath2 .",
    "( ii ) many physical systems , especially larger ones , exhibit not a single relaxation time but a whole hierarchy of time scales pertaining to the relaxation of different sets of degrees of freedom . in this case",
    "thermalization occurs in stages , on successively longer time scales @xcite .",
    "provided the typical contact times with the bath are shorter than the smallest scale in that hierarchy , the reconstruction scheme presented here is still valid .",
    "it pertains then to the first thermalization stage , with @xmath2 being no longer the equilibrium state but the target state of this first stage .",
    "if contact times vary widely across different relaxation time scales , however , the scheme must be adapted .",
    "( iii ) the system might be disturbed by not just one but several baths , each to independently varying degree , or the impact of a single bath might be governed by more than one parameter . then",
    ", rather than along a curve , tomographic images will be spread out in some higher - dimensional submanifold of state space .",
    "inferring the dimensionality of this submanifold , as well as the associated parameters , will require a further generalisation of the scheme presented here .",
    "( iv ) reconstructing the relaxation trajectory ( or submanifold ) is the first step towards the reconstruction of the system s unperturbed quantum state .",
    "i argued that this unperturbed quantum state must lie somewhere on the relaxation trajectory ( or submanifold ) ; but its precise location will depend on further assumptions , not considered in the present letter , about the distribution of the contact times and possibly other parameters of the bath .",
    "( v ) finally , i consider it worthwhile to study in more detail the conceptual underpinning as well as possible modifications of the steepest - descent paradigm . and on a speculative note , taking the steepest - descent paradigm at face value and identifying ( some suitable function of ) relative entropy as actual `` time , ''",
    "one might even be tempted to try to establish a link to ( equally speculative ) ideas in other areas of physics that aim to reduce the notion of time to a distance between configurations @xcite or thermal properties @xcite .",
