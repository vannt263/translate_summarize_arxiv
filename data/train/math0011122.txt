    "a great deal of work in algebraic topology has exploited the generalised cohomology theory @xmath8 ( for spaces @xmath9 ) , which is known as complex cobordism ; good entry points to the literature include  @xcite .",
    "this theory is interesting because of its connection with the theory of formal group laws ( fgl s ) , starting with quillen s fundamental theorem  @xcite that @xmath10 is actually the universal example of a ring equipped with an fgl .",
    "suppose that we have a graded ring @xmath11 equipped with an fgl .",
    "in the cases discussed below , the fgl involved will generally be the universal example of an fgl with some interesting property .",
    "examples include the rings known to topologists as @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 ; see section  [ sec - statements ] for the definitions .",
    "it is natural to ask whether there is a generalised cohomology theory @xmath16 whose value on a point is the ring @xmath11 , and a natural transformation @xmath17 , such that the resulting map @xmath18 carries the universal fgl over @xmath10 to the given fgl over @xmath11 .",
    "this question has a long history , and has been addressed by a number of different methods for different rings @xmath11 .",
    "the simplest case is when @xmath11 is obtained from @xmath10 by inverting some set @xmath19 of nonzero homogeneous elements , in other words @xmath20 . in that case",
    "the functor @xmath21 is a generalised cohomology theory on finite complexes , which can be extended to infinite complexes or spectra by standard methods .",
    "for example , given a prime @xmath22 one can invert all other primes to get a cohomology theory @xmath23 .",
    "cartier had previously introduced the notion of a @xmath22-typical fgl and constructed the universal example of such a thing over @xmath12 , which is a polynomial algebra over @xmath24 on generators @xmath25 in degree @xmath26 for @xmath27 .",
    "it was thus natural to ask our `` realisation question '' for @xmath28 .",
    "quillen  @xcite constructed an idempotent self map @xmath29 , whose image is a subring , which we call @xmath30 .",
    "he showed that this is a cohomology theory whose value on a point is the ring @xmath12 , and that the fgl s are compatible in the required manner .",
    "this cohomology theory was actually defined earlier by brown and peterson  @xcite ( hence the name ) , but in a less structured and precise way .",
    "it is not hard to check that we again have @xmath31 when @xmath9 is finite .",
    "this might tempt us to just define @xmath21 for any @xmath11 , but unfortunately this does not usually have the exactness properties required of a generalised cohomology theory .",
    "another major advance was landweber s determination  @xcite of the precise conditions under which @xmath32 does have the required exactness properties , which turned out to be natural ones from the point of view of formal groups . however , there are many cases of interest in which landweber s exactness conditions are not satisfied , and for these different methods are required . many of them are of the form @xmath33 for set @xmath19 of homogeneous elements and some homogeneous ideal @xmath34",
    ". for technical reasons things are easier if we assume that @xmath35 is generated by a regular sequence , in other words @xmath36 and @xmath37 is not a zero - divisor in @xmath38 . if @xmath11 arises in this way , we say that it is a _ localised regular quotient ( lrq ) _ of @xmath10 .",
    "if @xmath39 we say that @xmath11 is a _ regular quotient _ of @xmath10 .",
    "the first advance in this context was the baas - sullivan theory of cobordism of manifolds with singularities  @xcite . given a regular quotient @xmath11 of @xmath10 , this theory constructed a cohomology theory @xmath16 , landing in the category of @xmath10-modules , and a map @xmath17 .",
    "unfortunately , the details were technically unwieldy , and it was not clear whether @xmath16 was unique or whether it had a natural product structure , and if so whether it was commutative or associative .",
    "some of these questions were addressed by shimada and yagita  @xcite , mironov  @xcite and morava  @xcite , largely using the geometry of cobordisms .",
    "another idea was ( in special cases , modulo some technical details ) to calculate the group of all natural transformations @xmath40 and then see which of them are commutative , associative and unital .",
    "this was the approach of wrgler  @xcite ; much more recently , nassau has corrected some inaccuracies and extended these results  @xcite .",
    "baas - sullivan theory eventually yielded satisfactory answers for rings of the form @xmath41 , but the work involved in handling ideals with more than one generator remained rather hard .",
    "the picture changed dramatically with the publication of  @xcite by elmendorf , kriz , mandell and may ( hereafter referred to as ekmm ) , which we now explain .",
    "firstly , the natural home for our investigation is not really the category of generalised cohomology theories , but rather boardman s homotopy category of spectra  @xcite , which we call @xmath42 .",
    "there is a functor @xmath43 from finite complexes to @xmath42 , and any cohomology theory @xmath16 on finite complexes is represented by a spectrum @xmath44 in the sense that @xmath45 $ ] for all @xmath46 and @xmath9 .",
    "the representing spectrum @xmath47 is unique up to isomorphism  @xcite , and the isomorphism is often unique .",
    "there have been many different constructions of categories equivalent to @xmath42 .",
    "the starting point of  @xcite was ekmm s construction of a topological model category @xmath48 with a symmetric monoidal smash product , whose homotopy category is equivalent to @xmath42 .",
    "this was previously feared to be impossible , for subtle technical reasons  @xcite .",
    "ekmm were also able to construct a version of @xmath0 which was a strictly commutative monoid in @xmath48 , which allowed them to define the category @xmath49 of @xmath0-modules .",
    "they showed how to make this into topological model category , and thus defined an associated homotopy category @xmath50 .",
    "this again has a symmetric monoidal smash product , which should be thought of as a sort of tensor product over @xmath0 .",
    "they showed that the problem of realising lrq s of @xmath10 becomes very much easier if we work in @xmath50 ( and then apply a forgetful functor to @xmath42 if required ) .",
    "in fact their methods work when @xmath0 is replaced by any strictly commutative monoid @xmath51 in @xmath48 such that @xmath52 is concentrated in even degrees .",
    "they show that if @xmath11 is an lrq of @xmath52 and @xmath6 is invertible in @xmath11 and @xmath11 is concentrated in degrees divisible by @xmath4 , then @xmath47 can be realised as a commutative and associative ring object in @xmath53 .    in the present work",
    ", we will start by sharpening this slightly .",
    "the main point here is that ekmm notice an obstruction to associativity in @xmath54 , so they assume that these groups are zero .",
    "motivated by a parallel result in baas - sullivan theory  @xcite , we show that the associativity obstructions are zero even if the groups are not ( see remark  [ rem - ass ] ) .",
    "we deduce that if @xmath11 is an lrq of @xmath52 and @xmath6 is invertible in @xmath11 then @xmath47 can be realised as a commutative and associative ring in @xmath53 , in a way which is unique up to unique isomorphism ( theorem  [ thm - odd - general ] ) .",
    "we also prove a number of subsidiary results about the resulting ring objects .",
    "the more substantial part of our work is the attempt to remove the condition that @xmath6 be invertible in @xmath11 , without which the results become somewhat more technical .",
    "we show that the obstruction to defining a commutative product on @xmath55 is given by @xmath56 for a certain power operation @xmath57 .",
    "this was again inspired by a parallel result of mironov  @xcite .",
    "we deduce that if @xmath58 is an lrq of @xmath52 without @xmath6-torsion and @xmath59 then @xmath11 is again uniquely realisable ( theorem  [ thm - even - general ] ) .",
    "when @xmath11 has @xmath6-torsion we have no such general result and must proceed case by case . again following mironov",
    ", we show that when @xmath60 , the operation @xmath61 can be computed using formal group theory .",
    "we considerably extend and sharpen mironov s calculations , using techniques which i hope will be useful in more general work on power operations . using these results",
    ", we show that many popular lrq s of @xmath62 have almost unique realisations as associative , almost commutative rings in @xmath50 .",
    "see theorems  [ thm - muin ] and  [ thm - pn ] for precise statements .",
    "the major exceptions are the rings @xmath63 and @xmath15 , but we show that even these become uniquely realisable as commutative rings in @xmath50 if we allow ourselves to modify the usual definition slightly",
    ". we call the resulting spectra @xmath64 and @xmath65 ; they are acceptable substitutes for @xmath66 and @xmath67 in almost all situations .",
    "we use the category @xmath48 of @xmath19-modules as constructed in  @xcite ; we recall some details in section  [ sec - found ] .",
    "the main point is that @xmath48 is a symmetric monoidal category with a closed model structure whose homotopy category is boardman s homotopy category of spectra .",
    "we shall refer to the objects of @xmath48 simply as spectra .    because @xmath48 is a symmetric monoidal category",
    ", it makes sense to talk about strictly commutative ring spectra ; these are essentially equivalent to @xmath68 ring spectra in earlier foundational settings .",
    "let @xmath51 be such an object , such that @xmath69 is even ( by which we mean , concentrated in even degrees ) .",
    "we also assume that @xmath51 is @xmath70-cofibrant in the sense of  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter vii ) ( if not , we replace @xmath51 by a weakly equivalent cofibrant model ) .",
    "the main example of interest to us is @xmath60 .",
    "there are well - known constructions of @xmath0 as a spectrum in the earlier sense of lewis and may  @xcite , with an action of the @xmath68 operad of complex linear isometries .",
    "thus , the results of  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter ii ) allow us to construct @xmath0 as a strictly commutative ring spectrum .",
    "one can define a category @xmath71 of @xmath51-modules in the evident way , with all diagrams commuting at the geometric level .",
    "after inverting weak equivalences , we obtain a homotopy category @xmath72 , referred to as the derived category of @xmath71 .",
    "we shall mainly work in this derived category , and the category @xmath73 of ring objects in @xmath74 ( referred to in  @xcite as @xmath51-ring spectra ) .",
    "all our ring objects are assumed to be associative and to have a two - sided unit .",
    "thus , an object @xmath75 has an action @xmath76 which makes various diagrams commute at the geometric level , and a product @xmath77 that is geometrically compatible with the @xmath51-module structures , and is homotopically associative and unital .",
    "we also write @xmath78 for the category of algebras over the discrete ring @xmath79 .",
    "we write @xmath80 for the category of even @xmath79-algebras , and @xmath81 for the commutative ones , and similarly @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "let @xmath86 be an even commutative @xmath79-algebra without @xmath6-torsion .",
    "a _ strong realisation _ of @xmath86 is a commutative ring object @xmath87 with a given isomorphism @xmath88 , such that the resulting map @xmath89 is an isomorphism whenever @xmath90 and @xmath91 has no @xmath6-torsion .",
    "we say that @xmath86 is _ strongly realisable _ if such a realisation exists .",
    "it is easy to see that the category of strongly realisable @xmath79-algebras is equivalent to the category of those @xmath87 for which @xmath92 is strongly realisable . in particular ,",
    "any two strong realisations of @xmath86 are canonically isomorphic .",
    "our main aim is to prove that certain @xmath79-algebras are strongly realisable , and to prove some more _ ad hoc _",
    "results for certain algebras over @xmath93 .    a _ localised regular quotient ( lrq ) _ of @xmath79 is an algebra @xmath86 over @xmath79 that can be written in the form @xmath94 , where @xmath19 is any set of ( homogeneous ) elements in @xmath79 and @xmath35 is an ideal which can be generated by a regular sequence .",
    "we say that @xmath86 is a _ positive localised regular quotient ( plrq ) _ if it can be written in the form @xmath95 as above , where @xmath35 can be generated by a regular sequence of elements of nonnegative degree .",
    "if @xmath86 is an lrq of @xmath79 and @xmath91 is an arbitrary @xmath79-algebra then @xmath96 has at most one element .",

    "it follows that @xmath47 is a strong realisation of @xmath86 if and only if : whenever there is a map @xmath97 of @xmath79-algebras , there is a unique map @xmath98 in @xmath85 .",
    "[ rem - localisation ] let @xmath19 be a set of homogeneous elements in @xmath79 . using the results of  (",

    "this result was inspired by a parallel result of mironov in baas - sullivan theory  @xcite .",
    "the restriction @xmath107 is actually unneccessary but the argument for the case @xmath109 is intricate and we have no applications so we have omitted it . in section",
    "[ sec - formal ] we show how to compute this power operation using formal group theory , at least in the case @xmath60 .",
    "the first steps in this direction were also taken by mironov  @xcite , but our results are much more precise .",
    "by remark  [ rem - localisation ] we also have a power operation @xmath110 .",
    "this is in fact determined algebraically by the power operation on @xmath111 , as we will see in section  [ sec - formal ] .",
