    "let @xmath7 be the vertex degree of @xmath8 , where we note that a loop at vertex @xmath9 contributes @xmath10 to its degree . for simple graphs @xmath4 the edge degree @xmath11",
    "is defined as the number of edges meeting @xmath12 in either of its endpoints .",
    "note that this is equivalent to the vertex degree of @xmath12 in the line graph @xmath13 of @xmath4 .",
    "denote by @xmath14 the combinatorial distance between vertices @xmath15 .",
    "the universal cover @xmath16 of any graph @xmath4 is a tree with vertex set @xmath17 and edge set @xmath18 .",
    "it can be constructed as follows : choose a root vertex in @xmath4 , let the vertex set of @xmath16 be the set of non - backtracking paths in @xmath4 starting at the root vertex , and define two such paths @xmath19 to be neighbours if they differ by exactly one edge at the end ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* p833 ) ) . the projection map",
    "@xmath20 then takes @xmath21 , which represents a path in @xmath4 from the root vertex to @xmath8 , to this vertex @xmath8 , so @xmath22 .",
    "denote by @xmath23 the edge joining @xmath24 and @xmath25 , then @xmath26 .",
    "given a real function @xmath0 on the vertices @xmath6 ( or edges @xmath5 ) of @xmath4 , we can lift it uniquely to a function @xmath3 on the vertices ( edges ) of the universal cover via @xmath27 .",
    "we define a vertex sphere @xmath28 on the tree @xmath16 .",
    "the edge sphere is defined on @xmath29 as @xmath30 now we can define a spherical vertex _ arc",
    "_ @xmath31 on the tree as follows .",
    "let @xmath32 be a directed edge from vertex @xmath33 to @xmath34 .",
    "then @xmath35 is the arc based at @xmath33 in the direction of @xmath32 with radius @xmath36 , and we set @xmath37 .",
    "the edge arc is defined analogously by @xmath38 for @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the _ arc average _ of the function @xmath41 on the vertices or @xmath42 on the edges is now defined as @xmath43 where we replace @xmath31 by @xmath44 in the edge case .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to study the asymptotic behaviour of these averages as @xmath45 for particular types of graphs .",
    "we then use the result for arcs to prove similar results on other subsets of @xmath29 . to this end",
    ", we use an analogy between hyperbolic surfaces and regular graphs which has been studied by various authors ( see e.g.  the preface of @xcite ) .",
    "the problem studied by gnther @xcite for spheres in the hyperbolic plane translates to the case of the regular graph , where we obtain the following result for spherical arcs :    [ reg v ] let @xmath4 be a finite nonbipartite regular connected graph of degree @xmath46 and @xmath41 a function on its vertices .",
    "then we have for any directed edge @xmath32 in @xmath4 @xmath47 here @xmath48 is a constant depending on @xmath4 but independent of @xmath32 , and @xmath49 .",
    "obviously , this implies that @xmath50 for any directed edge @xmath32 .",
    "call the right hand side of equation the _ graph average _ of the function .",
    "the norm @xmath51 comes from the inner product @xmath52 .",
    "we exclude bipartite graphs in this theorem because spheres of even and odd radii have to be treated seperately in this case - see section [ other ] for details .",
    "we shall see in the proof that the convergence rate @xmath53 depends on the fourier coefficients of @xmath0 and the spectral gap . recall that ramanujan graphs are graphs with a large spectral gap ( see e.g.  @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "these graphs have either @xmath54 or @xmath55 for arbitrarily small @xmath56 , giving the best convergence rate for a general function . for more details",
    "see the proof in section [ pf reg v ] .",
    "the next result is concerned with functions defined on the edges of a regular graph .",
    "[ reg e ] let @xmath4 be a finite regular connected simple graph with @xmath57 and let @xmath42 be a function on its edges .",
    "then we have for any directed edge @xmath32 in @xmath4 @xmath58 here @xmath48 is a constant depending on @xmath4 but independent of @xmath32 , and @xmath59 .",
    "the norm here comes from the inner product @xmath60 .",
    "the precise value of @xmath53 is related to the spectrum of the edge laplacian ( see section [ pf reg e ] ) and the fourier coefficients of @xmath0 . again , we see that @xmath61 converges to the graph average , which is defined here as @xmath62 .",
    "it is important to note that it is not possible to use theorem [ reg v ] to prove theorem [ reg e ] ( and [ semihom ] below ) by looking at the corresponding line graph @xmath13 because taking the universal cover of a graph and taking the line graph are not interchangeable , i.e.  @xmath63 .",
    "( recall that the vertices of @xmath13 correspond to the edges of @xmath4 , and two vertices in @xmath13 are connected by an edge if the corresponding edges in @xmath4 have a vertex in common ) .",
    "this means that vertex arcs on @xmath64 and edge arcs on @xmath29 do nt coincide",
    ".    finally , we look at finite _ semiregular _ graphs , which are connected bipartite graphs where every edge connects a vertex of degree @xmath65 to one of degree @xmath66 , so that the edge degree is constant at @xmath67 .",
    "we shall only consider functions on the edges of this type of graph .",
    "[ semihom ] let @xmath4 be a finite semiregular simple graph with edge degree @xmath67 , where @xmath68 , and let @xmath42 be a function on its edges .",
    "then we have for any directed edge @xmath32 in @xmath4 @xmath58 here @xmath48 is a constant depending on @xmath4 but independent of @xmath32 , and @xmath69 .",
    "note that theorem [ semihom ] only deals with bipartite graphs , whereas in theorem [ reg e ] the graph may be either bipartite or not , so it is not a special case of theorem [ semihom ] .",
    "we need @xmath68 in this theorem , as @xmath70 can give a non - converging function on the graph .",
    "take for example @xmath71 , call the two vertices of degree three @xmath72 and @xmath73 , and define a function @xmath74 such that @xmath75 if @xmath72 is an endpoint of @xmath12 , and @xmath2 otherwise .",
    "clearly the arc average of @xmath0 takes the values @xmath76 in a recurring pattern and never converges .",
    "before we turn to the proofs of the above theorems and discuss further results , let us briefly explain how radial averages are related to non - backtracking random walks ( nbrw ) , a subject of active current research .",
    "the probabilities for a nbrw on the vertices of @xmath4 can be obtained from the radial average of the characteristic function @xmath77 of a vertex @xmath78 over increasing spheres ( see section [ other ] ) .",
    "the average at radius @xmath79 then gives the probability that a random walk of length @xmath79 starting at @xmath33 ends at @xmath72 .",
    "however , the random walk equivalent of theorem [ reg v ] would be a nbrw _ with prescribed first step _ , which to the best of the authors knowledge has not been studied .",
    "results by @xcite and @xcite can be used to give an alternative proof of corollary [ sphere v ] ( see section [ other ] ) , in fact the mixing rate obtained in @xcite is exactly the convergence rate obtained in the corollary for a general function @xmath0 . if on the other hand we know the fourier coefficients of @xmath0 , we can sometimes improve the convergence rate .",
    "finally , tube and horocycle results ( see section [ other ] ) do not have an obvious nbrw equivalent .",
    "nbrw have been studied in the context of cogrowth on graphs , which was first introduced in the context of groups and their cayley graphs .",
    "this was studied in the early 1980s by e.g.  grigorchuk @xcite , cohen @xcite and woess @xcite . in the 1990s",
    "the application of cogrowth was extended to arbitrary graphs , see for example northshield @xcite or bartholdi @xcite .",
    "we define the growth of the tree @xmath16 by @xmath80 and the cogrowth of the graph @xmath4 by @xmath81 both of which are independent of @xmath82 , where @xmath83 .",
    "then the cogrowth constant is @xmath84 .",
    "more recently , ortner and woess @xcite generalised the definition of cogrowth and used it to study nbrw .",
    "they set @xmath85 where @xmath86 is a sequence of probability measures concentrated on the sphere @xmath87 , subject to some regularity conditions .",
    "choosing particular measures one obtains cogrowth or nbrw probabilities , and both notions coincide in the case of a regular graph .    in the following three sections we give proofs of the three theorems stated .",
    "the final section includes applications of the results on arcs to results on more general geometric sets , namely spheres , tubes and horocycles .",
    "we start by discussing theorem [ reg v ] , namely the case of a function on the vertices of a finite connected non - bipartite regular graph @xmath4 of degree @xmath46 .",
    "let @xmath88 be a function on the vertices of the graph @xmath4 .",
    "we define the laplacian of @xmath0 at @xmath8 as @xmath89 as a matrix , we can express the laplacian as @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the adjacency matrix of the graph .",
    "this means it is a real symmetric operator with eigenvalues @xmath92 satisfying @xmath93 .",
    "the eigenvalue @xmath2 occurs iff @xmath4 is bipartite ( see for example ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 1.8 ) ) , and we have excluded this case from the theorem precisely due to this eigenvalue .",
    "the simple eigenvalue @xmath94 is associated to the constant eigenfunction , so for all nonconstant eigenfunctions we now have @xmath95 .",
    "we will show that the arc average converges to the graph average , and then use the proof to calculate the convergence rate .",
    "first we prove the convergence result for a basis of functions on @xmath4 .",
    "choose the orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions @xmath96 of the laplacian with corresponding eigenvalues @xmath97 .",
    "let @xmath98 be the constant eigenfunction , and note that here the arc average @xmath99 clearly equals the graph average for all @xmath79 .",
    "the @xmath96 are orthogonal , so @xmath100 and hence @xmath101 for @xmath102 . to prove convergence ,",
    "our first aim is to show that @xmath103 for @xmath104 .    for each eigenfunction @xmath105 on @xmath4",
    "let @xmath106 be its lift onto the universal covering tree @xmath16 , where it is an eigenfunction of @xmath107 with the same eigenvalue @xmath97 .",
    "define the _ radial average _ of @xmath108 with respect to the directed edge @xmath32 from @xmath33 to @xmath34 as @xmath109 where @xmath110 .",

    "@xmath113 depends only on @xmath114 , hence we shall denote it @xmath115 for all @xmath116 . observe that @xmath117 .",
    "using @xmath118 we obtain a recursion relation for @xmath115 namely @xmath119 note @xmath120 and @xmath121 give the initial conditions .",

    "it just remains to check that @xmath131 and @xmath132 to show that @xmath133 for @xmath102 as required .    for the calculation of the convergence rate",
    "we distinguish three cases :    * case 1 @xmath134 * ( @xmath135 ) : we find @xmath136 and @xmath137 for some constant @xmath138 which depends on @xmath139 and @xmath140 , that is @xmath96 and @xmath32 .",
    "now there are only finitely many values of @xmath126 , as there are only finitely many choices of @xmath32",

    "applying cauchy - schwarz to equation [ e1 ] , we obtain @xmath165 where @xmath166 .",
    "note that this convergence is independent of @xmath32 , and that for ramanujan graphs we obtain @xmath54 ( or @xmath167 if @xmath168 ) as all their eigenvalues give @xmath169 .",
    "it turns out that the general @xmath53 ( for unknown fourier coefficients @xmath161 ) is exactly the mixing rate for nbrw found in @xcite .",
    "recall from the introduction that their result corresponds to taking an average over a vertex _ sphere _ @xmath170 rather than an arc . if we know",
    "that one or more fourier coefficients of @xmath0 vanish , we can get a value of @xmath53 smaller than this mixing rate .",
    "theorem [ reg e ] concerns functions on the edges of a regular graph @xmath4 , and the method of proof follows that of the vertex case apart from a small deviation towards the end .",
    "we no longer allow the graph to have loops or multiple edges , and require @xmath171 .",
    "let @xmath172 be a function on the edges of a graph @xmath4 .",
    "then the ( edge ) laplacian of @xmath173 at @xmath174 is defined as @xmath175 where @xmath176 means that the edge @xmath32 has a vertex in common with @xmath12 .",
    "note that this is equivalent to taking the vertex laplacian on the line graph @xmath13 of @xmath4 .",
    "we find that here the range of eigenvalues of the edge laplacian is smaller , namely @xmath177 , as for any line graph the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix are no less than @xmath178 , see @xcite .",
    "the recurrence relation now looks as follows @xmath179 once again we want to show for @xmath180 that @xmath133 . for @xmath181",

    "theorem 3 in @xcite states that any eigenfunction of the edge laplacian with eigenvalue @xmath178 ( which corresponds to @xmath199 ) must have @xmath200 for all @xmath201 .",

    "finally we prove our third theorem . here",
    "we deal with functions on the edges of a simple semiregular graph with edge degree @xmath67 , where we require that @xmath68 . as for theorem [ reg e ] ,",
    "we reduce the problem to the radialisation of nonconstant eigenfunctions of the edge laplacian , which now has eigenvalues @xmath206 . recall that the arc is defined to be based at a vertex @xmath33 , which we assume has degree @xmath65 .    because @xmath4 is semiregular",
    ", there is a more complicated recursion formula for the radialised eigenfunction @xmath115 with eigenvalue @xmath97 on the edges of the universal covering tree @xmath16 . using the laplacian on @xmath29 , given by @xmath207 , we find for positive integers @xmath208 @xmath209 and @xmath210 rearranging the expressions and then combining the two equations",
