    "the surprising discovery of high-@xmath3 materials by bednorz and mller @xcite has sparked renewed interest in low - dimensional strongly correlated quantum systems .",
    "a striking feature of these materials is that they show simple long range antiferromagnetic ( af ) order at low temperatures when they are not doped with holes .    between the well - known one - dimensional systems and the difficult two dimensional system , coupled chains ( or ladders )",
    "are interesting intermediate systems .",
    "the most striking feature of 2m - leg ladders is the appearance of a spin - gap at half - filling and small doping @xcite .",
    "for instance compounds such as sr@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath6 have been shown to be well described by a lattice of coupled -leg ladders , with @xcite .",
    "another example containing two - leg ladders is the system @xcite which is a material with doped ladders @xcite and where superconductivity ( under high pressure ) has been observed@xcite .",
    "an important step is the determination of the phase diagram .",
    "balents and fisher @xcite have computed the phase diagram of the hubbard - ladder in the weak coupling limit in the frame of bosonization and renormalization group theory . to distinguish the different phases they introduced the notation c@xmath7s@xmath8 for labeling phases with @xmath7 _ gapless _ charge and @xmath8 _ gapless _ spin excitations .",
    "@xcite investigated then the different phases numerically with density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) methods for intermediate coupling and found good agreement with the analytical results of the weak coupling limit .",
    "the main feature is the existence of two regions , the luther - emery ( le ) region with a spin gap ( c1s0 ) and the luttinger - liquid ( ll ) with one gapless excitation ( c1s1 ) .",
    "the strong coupling model @xcite has also been studied extensively by different authors .",
    "it is given by the hamiltonian @xmath9 where the index @xmath10 refers to legs and @xmath11 to rungs .",
    "the @xmath12 operators denote the fermion operators with projection onto the singly occupied states , i.e. . in this paper",
    ", we report a detailed study of the phase diagram for isotropic coupling ( i.e. rungs and legs equal ) as a function of electron density @xmath0 and the ratio @xmath1 .    in the strong coupling limit , the spin - gap can be easily represented . at half - filling",
    ", the ground state is formed by spin - singlets lying on each rung .",
    "turning over one spin gives a triplet on the corresponding rung .",
    "the energy difference between the two states , the spin - gap , is @xmath13 .",
    "numerically , it is found that the spin gap in the isotropic case @xmath14 reduces to @xcite .",
    "the spin - gap of a doped ladder for @xmath15 is due to a qualitatively different process .",
    "some singlets have been replaced by hole - pairs moving along the ladder with a renormalized hopping @xmath16 .",
    "the lowest excitation arises by breaking one hole pair ( or equivalently a singlet bond ) and putting each unbound spin on well - separated rungs .",
    "turning over one of the separate spins gives the lowest triplet excitation with @xmath17 leading to a finite spin - gap ( le ) . at the isotropic point @xmath18 and for @xmath19",
    "the spin - gap still exists where now the bound holes share neighboring rungs and strong singlet correlations are measured on the remaining sites  @xcite .",
    "the spin - gap is thus a discontinuous function of doping in the vicinity of half - filling . for higher values of the parameter @xmath1",
    ", holes and electrons separate completely at all doping levels .",
    "thus , the appearance of the spin gap in a doped ladder is directly correlated with the formation of hole pairs , and it is an interesting problem to study their stability .",
    "@xcite used a numerical method based on lanczos algorithms , which has allowed them to distinguish between the gapped and gapless regions in the phase diagram .",
    "hayward and poilblanc @xcite determined the non - universal correlation exponents defining the behavior of the long - range correlations .",
    "they found at low electron density the system is in a ll phase , while for a higher electron density a gapped phase with hole pairs is stabilized .",
    "a large region of this gapped phase exhibits dominant superconducting correlations .",
    "the boundary of these two phases was determined to be where , in the band picture , the fermi energy @xmath20 just touches the antibonding band .    however , some parts of the phase diagram are still unclear . first , the finite - size scaling process to determine the spin - gap region does not give clear results for values of .",
    "second , the radius of the hole pairs increases with decreasing @xmath1 , and it is not clear whether it diverges for a particular value , and if a transition to a gapless phase occurs for small @xmath1 . for very small values of @xmath1 ,",
    "the @xmath21@xmath22 model is similar to the hubbard model with .",
    "since for two coupled chains , all spin configurations with a fixed @xmath23 are coupled by hole hopping as in a two - dimensional system , the essential condition for the nagaoka theorem @xcite is fulfilled .",
    "a ferromagnetic phase occurs for very small values of @xmath1 and low hole doping . in this phase ,",
    "no spin gap occurs and holes repel each other . with increasing @xmath1 , the ground state rapidly evolves into a singlet state .",
    "this part of the phase diagram will be extensively studied on the basis of exact diagonalization results for small clusters , typically 10-rung ladders .",
    "finite - size effects can be important for such systems , and it will be tried to minimize them as much as possible .",
    "a lanczos algorithm will be used to investigate the different phases . with current computers it is possible to investigate 2 leg ladders of length @xmath24 at any filling . in order to carry out a systematic analysis for different doping , the boundary conditions ( bc )",
    "must be chosen carefully .",
