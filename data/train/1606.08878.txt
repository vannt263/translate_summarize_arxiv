    "the identity of dark matter ( dm ) is one of the most interesting and relevant topics in particle physics today .",
    "currently , there are several direct and indirect searches for dm performed by different experiments , such as supercdms @xcite , lz @xcite , ams2 @xcite , atlas @xcite and cms @xcite , among others .",
    "these experiments are trying to find evidence of the existence of dm particles motivated by hypothetical models , in some cases , or by indirect cosmological observations .",
    "nevertheless , there is no conclusive evidence thus far that could shed some light on the particle nature of dm .    at the cern lhc accelerator ,",
    "the atlas and cms experiments have an extensive physics program to search for dm , especially in new physics models of supersymmetry ( susy)@xcite , which resolves many problems inherent in the standard model ( sm ) and naturally provides a dm candidate in the form of the lightest neutralino ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "a broad set of final states have been used to probe the @xmath5 using cascade decays of heavier colored and electroweak susy particles @xcite .",
    "the production of these dm candidates has been excluded , by both experiments , for @xmath5 masses that range from 100 gev to roughly 800 gev , depending on the final state studied and on the physics model used to interpret the data . nevertheless , compressed mass spectra regions , where the mass difference @xmath7 between the heavier susy particles and the @xmath5 is small , are very difficult to probe at the lhc , due to constrains driven by the ability to trigger , with low enough rate , on events containing low @xmath0 objects in addition to experimental difficulties involved with identifying them with high enough efficiency amongst the large hadronic activity associated with a proton - proton collider . for example , searches for chargino ( @xmath8 ) and neutralino ( @xmath9 ) production in final states with one or more leptons and missing transverse momentum exhibit limited sensitivity to models with susy particles that decay predominantly to @xmath10 leptons , with exclusion limits of @xmath11 gev for @xmath12 gev , due to the larger backgrounds associated with @xmath10 lepton reconstruction .",
    "the main focus of this letter is to propose a new search at the lhc to target compressed mass spectra regions in the electroweak sector , in models which predominantly produce @xmath10 leptons , where the current experimental sensitivity is limited .",
    "the study of compressed @xmath2 s is of special interest in thermal bino dm cosmology models considering @xmath13 co - annihilation , as it is proposed in several papers  @xcite , in order to obtain the correct relic dm density observed today .",
    "the use of vector boson fusion ( vbf ) topologies to target difficult compressed mass spectra scenarios for the production of susy with @xmath2 s , has been proposed as a new experimental handle at the lhc @xcite .",
    "this search has been recently published by cms @xcite , showing better sensitivity in very compressed regions with respect to previous searches by atlas and cms @xcite .",
    "although vbf is a good tool to probe compressed spectra and dm @xcite , with better signal - to - background ratios due to its rejection power for qcd processes , the small vbf signal cross - sections motivate us to find a complementary method with higher production rate , which translates in less luminosity needed for a potential discovery in the short term .",
    "we propose a complementary handle to target compressed staus , searching for the production of one hadronic @xmath10 lepton ( @xmath14 ) and at least one high @xmath0 jet from initial state radiation ( isr ) .",
    "the susy @xmath2 s can be produced directly in pairs or through cascade decays of the lightest chargino , @xmath15 , and the next - to - lightest neutralino , @xmath16 , in processes such as @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "hadronic decays of @xmath10 leptons have the largest branching fraction and thus final states with a @xmath14 provide the best experimental sensitivity .    while the above processes result in final states with multiple @xmath10 leptons , the compressed mass spectra scenario of interest in this paper results in low @xmath0 visible decay products , making it difficult to reconstruct and identify multiple @xmath10 leptons",
    ". furthermore , semi - leptonic decays of @xmath10 leptons result in lower average @xmath0 than hadronic decays , while also being largely indistinguishable from prompt production of electrons and muons .",
    "therefore , the above characteristics motivate us to focus on events with one @xmath14 candidate .",
    "similar to the monojet searches , the use of a high @xmath0 isr jet in the event topology is expected to create a recoil effect that facilitates both , the detection of missing transverse momentum in the event ( @xmath21 ) , and the identification of the soft @xmath14 due to the natural kinematic boost .",
    "additionally , the inclusion of a high @xmath0 jet in the event topology provides an experimental handle to trigger on these type of events with soft @xmath14 candidates .",
    "signal and background samples were simulated using an interface between madgraph ( v2.2.3 ) @xcite for the events generation , pythia ( v6.416 ) @xcite for the hadronization process and delphes ( v3.3.2 ) @xcite to include detector effects .",
    "the main background sources come from the production of z and w vector bosons with associated jets , referred to as z+jets and w+jets .",
    "background events with up to two associate jets were generated .",
    "jet merging and matching was performed based on the mlm algorithm @xcite .",
    "this algorithm requires the optimization of two variables related to the jet definition , qcut and xqcut .",
    "the xqcut is defined as the minimal distance required among partons at madgraph level .",
    "the qcut is a measure of the minimum energy spread for a clustered jet in pythia .",
    "the optimization is performed by studying the differential jet rate distribution until obtaining a smooth transition between events with zero and one jets , and between events with one and two jets .",
    "the optimal values found for our simulations were a xqcut of 15 for both backgrounds , and a qcut of 35 gev for z+jets and 30 gev for w+jets . at generation level , leptons were required to have a @xmath22 gev and @xmath23 , while jets are required to have a minimum @xmath0 threshold of 20 gev and @xmath24 . for z+jets events , an additional constrain on the reconstructed mass of the two leptons was applied , in order to suppress events with masses below 50 gev .",
    "the signal samples were produced considering two cases in the context of the r - parity conserving minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "the first case considered direct production of @xmath2 pairs and an isr jet and the second case included additional production of @xmath2 events through cascade decays of @xmath15 or @xmath16 .",
    "the benchmark signal samples were produced under the three following assumptions .",
    "first , the @xmath15 and the @xmath16 are wino - like and mass degenerate , while the @xmath5 is mostly bino .",
    "second , we considered only scenarios where the mass difference between the @xmath2 and the @xmath25 is always less or equal to 25 gev , aimed at the @xmath2-@xmath5 co - annihilation region , and with mass equal to @xmath26 .",
    "finally , we studied regions where the mass difference between the @xmath25 and the @xmath4 is below 50 gev , in order to study areas of the susy phase space where the atlas and cms searches have limited experimental sensitivity .",
    "we scaned the regions of interest using @xmath15 masses ranging from 100 gev to 400 gev , in steps of 100 gev , and @xmath27 from 5 gev to 25 gev , in steps of 5 gev .",
    "the event selection criteria used in the analysis is summarized in table  [ tab : selections ] .",
    "the @xmath0 threshold for the highest @xmath0 jet ( @xmath28 ) was defined through an optimization process , based on the @xmath29 figure of merit , to estimate the signal significance .",
    "the @xmath30 selection was also chosen to provide an experimental handle to trigger on these types of events at atlas and cms . in order to focus on events where the isr jet can naturally boost the @xmath21 in the opposite direction ,",
    "jets are constrained to be within the tracker acceptance region , @xmath312.5 .",
    "we selected the highest @xmath0 jet in the event , as the isr jet .",
    "the highest @xmath0 jet correctly identifies the isr jet with greater than 95% accuracy .",
    "events containing an isolated electron or muon , with @xmath32 gev , have been removed in order to suppress the contribution from the w+jets , z+jets and @xmath33 backgrounds .",
    "the contribution from di - boson events , is heavily suppressed after vetoing events with two or more leptons .",
    "events with top quarks become negligible after vetoing jets , tagged as bottom quarks , with @xmath32 gev and @xmath34 2.5 .",
    "events are required to have exactly one @xmath14 with @xmath35 gev and @xmath36 .",
    "the selection criteria on the pseudo - rapidity of @xmath14 , @xmath37 2.3 , is also motivated by the geometric acceptance of the tracker sub - detectors in both experiments and the isolation cones placed around the @xmath14 candidates , commonly used to reject jets from qcd processes that can mimic the signature of a @xmath14 .",
    "jets and @xmath14 candidates passing the outlined selection criteria are required to be well separated in @xmath38 space by a cut of @xmath39 greater than 0.4 .",
    "the @xmath40 and @xmath21 thresholds were optimized in a two dimensional plane , after passing the selection criteria described above , allowing us to find the most suitable combination of the two variables .",
    "the signal benchmark sample with @xmath41 gev , @xmath42 gev and @xmath43 gev , was used for the optimization .",
    "the best significance is achieved when @xmath40 is within the range 15 gev @xmath44 35 gev , with a @xmath45 requirement above 230 gev . after requiring a @xmath45 threshold of 230 gev ,",
    "the contribution from qcd events becomes negligible .",
    "figure [ fig : significance ] shows the results of the @xmath46 vs. @xmath45 optimization process , using events selected with @xmath47 gev , @xmath48 gev , and satisfying the extra lepton and b - jet vetoes .",
    "the increase in signal significance due to the requirement of a soft @xmath14 , as shown in figure [ fig : significance ] , highlights the importance of having good @xmath14 identification at low @xmath0 . on average , a 20% improvement in the overall signal significance for very compressed @xmath49 scenarios , is observed by lowering the @xmath40 threshold from 20 gev to 15 gev .",
    "other sets of topological variables were analyzed , such as different combination of variables related to the angular difference in the @xmath50 plane between the highest @xmath0 jet , the @xmath14 and the @xmath21 .",
    "however , no significant additional discrimination between the hypothetical signal and the background was observed .",
    "similarly , other distributions such as the scalar sum of the @xmath0 of the jets in the event ( @xmath51 ) and the ratio of @xmath45 to @xmath28 , @xmath52 @xcite , were also studied .",
    "neither the @xmath51 nor the @xmath52 variables yield additional signal to background discrimination .",
    ".cuts used to select events with one @xmath14 and at least one high @xmath0 isr jet .",
    "the highest @xmath0 jet is tagged as the isr jet . [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the proposed shape based analysis of the @xmath53 distribution is performed using a binned likelihood following the test statistic based on the profile likelihood ratio , using the rootfit @xcite toolkit . as can be seen from figure [ fig : mt ] , the signal sensitivity with the integrated luminosity considered is dominated by the signal and background yields in the tails of the @xmath53 distribution , where statistical uncertainties are expected to be more important than systematic uncertainties . however , since the proposed search strategy entails a fit of the entire @xmath53 distribution , it is appropriate to consider reasonable experimental systematic uncertainties to calculate projected significance as this fitting procedure can have important correlations to the background and signal uncertainties at low @xmath53 , where statistical uncertainties are small .",
    "the dominant sources of systematics are expected to be the uncertainty on @xmath14 identification ( 6% based on @xcite ) , @xmath45 trigger efficiency ( 1% based on @xcite ) , modeling of isr ( 5% based on @xcite ) , pileup effects , and the uncertainty on transfer factors used to estimate the backgrounds .",
    "while it is beyond the scope of this paper to perform studies on background estimation methods , we refer to the monojet searches with 8 tev data @xcite as a reasonable choice for the uncertainty on the transfer factors used to estimate backgrounds ( @xmath54% for @xmath55 gev ) .",
    "therefore , a 10% total systematic uncertainty on the signal and background yields is a reasonable choice . in our studies ,",
    "the systematic uncertainties are incorporated via nuisance parameters following the frequentist approach .",
    "a local p - value is calculated as the probability under a background only hypothesis to obtain a value of the test statistic as large as that obtained with a signal plus background hypothesis . the significance @xmath56 is then determined as the value at which the integral of a gaussian between @xmath56 and @xmath57 results in a value equal to the local p - value .",
    "figure [ fig : results ] shows the expected signal significance without considering any systematic effects .",
    "figure [ fig : results1 ] shows the expected signal significance after considering a flat 10% systematic effect , completely correlated across @xmath53 bins , in the signal and background yields",
    ". the proposed methodology can provide @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) significance for @xmath4 masses up to approximately 250 gev ( 300 gev ) and with @xmath60 gev , allowing the atlas and cms experiments to probe previously unreachable parts of the @xmath61 co - annihilation phase space important to the connection between particle physics and cosmology .",
    "the assumption of a completely correlated systematic uncertainty with respect to @xmath53 is based on the belief that the @xmath14 identification and @xmath45 trigger efficiencies do not depend on the value of @xmath53 .",
    "this assumption depends on the performance of the improved and updated reconstruction algorithms of the cms and atlas experiments under future running conditions , which is outside the scope of this paper .",
    "however , for the luminosity considered , the conclusions have been tested to be independent of the assumption of a completely correlated systematic uncertainty with @xmath53 .",
    "although the benchmark signal samples considered thus far focus on the case where the @xmath4/@xmath62 is mostly wino and the lsp is mostly bino ( when co - annihilation can give rise to the correct lsp dm relic density ) , a study is also performed on the impact of wino and bino compositions of the @xmath4/@xmath62 and lsp , respectively , to the signal sensitivity .",
    "this allows for a more general overview of the impact of the proposed search to compressed susy , independent of the connection to cosmological dm . for this purpose ,",
    "signal samples were produced by fixing the @xmath4/@xmath62 and lsp masses and varying the @xmath63 parameter , which controls the gaugino mixing .",
    "for example , for @xmath64 gev and @xmath65 gev , the @xmath63 parameter was decreased to produce lsp bino compositions ranging from 50% to 97% .",
    "decreasing the @xmath63 parameter in order to decrease the lsp bino composition makes the higgsinos more important and thus simultaneously decreases the wino composition for @xmath4/@xmath62 ( i.e. they are no longer mostly wino - like ) .",
    "the wino compositions for @xmath4/@xmath62 range from @xmath66% to 99% . figures [ fig : results2 ] and [ fig : results3 ] show the expected signal significance , using an integrated luminosity of 30 fb@xmath6 , as a function of @xmath67 and lsp bino composition for fixed @xmath7 of 25 gev and 5 gev respectively . for a fixed set of masses , the predicted signal yields decrease as the lsp bino and @xmath4/@xmath62 wino compositions decrease , resulting in @xmath68 55% decrease in signal significance for a lsp bino composition of 50% .",
    "the signal significances shown in figures [ fig : results2 ] and [ fig : results3 ] were calculated using the same statistical procedure outlined above and similarly considering a 10% systematic uncertainty .",

    "the main result of this paper is that the @xmath2-@xmath5 co - annihilation region with @xmath12 gev , where experimental sensitivity is limited from current searches performed at the lhc , can be probed using a search strategy of one soft hadronically decaying tau lepton and large missing transverse energy recoiling against a hard @xmath0 jet from initial state radiation .",
    "these regions of susy also play a decisive role in thermal bino dm cosmology models which require @xmath2-@xmath5 co - annihilation to obtain the correct relic dm density observed today .",
    "a major highlight of the proposed search strategy is the ability to select low @xmath0 hadronic tau decays , facilitated by the use of @xmath45 triggers from the boost effect of the high @xmath0 isr jet , in order to maximize signal acceptance in these compressed scenarios while simultaneously providing large reduction against sm backgrounds .",
    "the ability of the atlas and cms experiments to provide good @xmath14 identification at low @xmath0 is a key ingredient .",
    "we find that for @xmath71 gev , gaugino masses up to 300 gev ( 250 gev ) can be probed at 3@xmath3 ( 5@xmath3 ) level with 30 fb@xmath6 of 13 tev data from the lhc .",
    "we emphasize that the experimental constraints for the susy parameter space with @xmath71 gev with the atlas and cms data to date do not exceed those of the lep experiments , and thus the proposed new search can nicely complement the current analyses performed at the lhc .",
