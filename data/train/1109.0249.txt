    "in the last century general relativity passed several stringent tests and it is now accepted as the standard theory of gravity and one of mankind s greatest achievements  @xcite . in the weak - field regime , general relativity reduces to newtonian gravity , which is encoded in the famous poisson equation for the gravitational field ^2=4,[poisson ] where @xmath1 is the gravitational constant and @xmath2 is the matter density . in vacuum ,",
    "the gravitational field of a spherically symmetric mass @xmath3 simply reads ( r)=-m / r.[inversesquarelaw ] the validity region of the equation above has been tested and confirmed from submillimeter  @xcite to solar system experiments  @xcite .",
    "however , much less is known about poisson s equation   inside matter .",
    "in fact , the coupling to matter is one of the most delicate points in einstein s theory .",
    "several alternative theories have been proposed , which introduce modifications in the coupling between matter and gravity ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the investigation of possible alternatives to the general relativity paradigm are important . extrapolating einstein s theory to regimes",
    "in which it is not well - tested may lead to bias , potentially affecting astrophysical observations and our understanding of the universe .    at relativistic level",
    ", corrections in the gravity - matter coupling would affect the interior of neutron stars and the cosmological evolution of the universe  @xcite",
    ". however , the uncertainty on the correct equation of state ( eos ) describing the interior of a neutron star makes it difficult to disentangle the effects of an alternative theory from those due to a different eos .    on the other hand ,",
    "deviations from standard gravity have been proposed even at newtonian level  @xcite in a way which is compatible with current experimental bounds .",
    "theories such as these are consistent with all observations and at the same time are able to avoid long - standing problems of standard gravity .",
    "thus , modified theories should be taken seriously and as important alternatives to explain our universe and it is of utmost importance to develop methods to test and constrain them against standard gravity .    in this work",
    "we propose a new approach , which is not affected by the degeneracy problems in neutron star physics and is complementary to cosmological tests .",
    "we shall investigative how deviations in eq .   would affect the evolution and the equilibrium structure of the sun and other stars , leaving potentially observable effects . the high accuracy obtained with",
    "current standard solar models and precise observations of the acoustic modes and neutrino fluxes allow to perform stringent tests of the physics governing the star evolution and interior  @xcite . in the past ,",
    "stellar evolution has been used to constrain a possible time dependence of newton s constant @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "more recently , similar ideas have been used to put constraints on the value of @xmath1  @xcite , on the properties of dark matter particles  @xcite , and on the couplings of other particles  @xcite .",
    "finally , possible modifications to the stellar structure in some alternative scenarios were studied by  @xcite using polytropic models .",
    "given the high ( and increasing ) accuracy of present realistic solar models and related observations , using the sun as a _ theoretical laboratory _ where alternative theories of gravity can be challenged , is a very promising tool to constrain deviations from newtonian gravity .",
    "the parametrized post newtonian approach proved to be extremely efficient to constrain weak - field deviations from general relativity _ in orbital motion _ @xcite .",
    "the approach is based on a very general parametrization of the metric functions , and does not require any knowledge of the underlying alternative ( metric ) theory . following a similar approach , here we parametrize viable couplings between matter and gravity in the non - relativistic limit , i.e. within newtonian theory .",
    "we require a modified poisson equation which reduces to the usual one in vacuum , but which can accommodate extra terms in the coupling with matter . assuming this theory is the non - relativistic limit of some covariant relativistic theory",
    ", we also require spacial covariance .",
    "finally , we assume the theory contains at most second - order derivatives in the fields , although this condition can be easily relaxed . a general modified poisson equation , up to second order in @xmath4 , @xmath2 and derivatives , which satisfies these requirements , reads @xmath5 the first term on the right hand side of the equation above is the standard poisson term .",
    "the second one , proportional to @xmath6 , arises from the eddington - inspired gravity theory recently proposed by @xcite .",
    "the other terms are higher order corrections and @xmath7 is the levi - civita symbol .",
    "all the parametrized corrections vanish in vacuum , so that the theory above is consistent with the inverse square law behavior  , but most of the extra terms in eq .",
    "violate the equivalence principle and are therefore already strongly constrained by experiments  @xcite .",
    "two notable exceptions are the terms proportional to @xmath6 and , for spherically symmetric configurations , the term proportional to @xmath8",
    ". these two terms are consistent with the equivalence principle , and mostly unconstrained presently .      for concreteness",
    ", here we focus on a particular case , setting @xmath9 in eq .  .",
    "the modified poisson equation reduces to @xmath10 where @xmath11=\\text{cm}^5/(\\text{g s}^2)=[[\\mathit{g}]][[r^2]]$ ] . requiring spherical symmetry",
    ", the hydrostatic equilibrium equation follows = --.[hydroeq2 ] where no terms proportional to @xmath8 arise , due to the spherical symmetry .",
    "the choice @xmath12 is motivated by several reasons .",
    "first of all , the terms we are neglecting would introduce violations to the equivalence principle , which is experimentally confirmed with great precision  @xcite .",
    "secondly , the equation above represents the most general modified poisson equation which is first order in @xmath4 , @xmath2 and satisfies the requirements previously discussed .",
    "the extra terms would only introduce higher order corrections .",
    "furthermore , this theory is the nonrelativistic limit of a well - motivated theory of gravity , which prevents the formation of singularities in cosmology and in the stellar collapse of compact objects  @xcite .",
    "here we investigate how this theory would modify the interior and the evolution of the sun .",
    "the high accuracy of current solar models and precise observations allow to test standard gravity against alternative theories at unprecedented levels .",
    "alternative theories would affect the evolution and the equilibrium structure the sun , giving different core temperature profiles and deviations in the observed acoustic modes and in solar neutrino fluxes . comparing the predictions from a modified solar model with observations",
    ", we can constrain the coupling parameter of the theory .    modeling the solar interior not only requires to describe the present solar structure , but also to explain the evolution of the sun from the ignition of hydrogen nuclear fusion to the present day ( see e.g.  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the solar models are constructed on the basis of plausible assumptions , which translate in a set of four ordinary differential equations .",
    "the star is considered in hydrostatic equilibrium , which means that the hydrostatic pressure resulting from the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen to helium must be exactly balanced by gravity .",
    "the nuclear reactions are produced in the pp chain and in the cno cycle , the former affecting more strongly the temperature profile in the solar core .",
    "furthermore , the star is assumed to be in thermal equilibrium , i.e. the energy produced by nuclear reactions balances the total energy loss via radiative energy flux and via the energy carried away by neutrinos .    within @xmath13 of the solar radius ,",
    "the most efficient transport mechanism of energy from the solar center outwards to the stellar surface is due to electromagnetic radiation , while in the outer region , the so - called convective zone , the energy is mainly transported by convection . the radiative energy transport ( and , in turn , the temperature profile )",
    "is governed by the rosseland mean opacity , which takes into account that photons interact with electrons and ions in the dense plasma in the solar interior , while they mostly interact with atoms and molecules at the solar surface , where radiative transport is again significant .",
    "one of the basic assumptions of any solar model , namely the hydrostatic equilibrium , ultimately depends on how strong and efficient the gravitational self - interaction is inside the sun , i.e. on poisson s equation  .",
    "any corrections would affect the thermal balance and , in turn , the temperature profile inside the star , leaving potentially observable signatures .",
    "finally , effects due to rotation  @xcite and magnetic fields  @xcite are usually neglected in standard solar models . these processes",
    "take place on a much shorter timescale than the evolutionary timescale of the sun and their inclusion results in minor structure changes in the solar interior ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "under the previous assumptions , the internal structure of the sun is governed by the following ordinary differential equations for @xmath14 , the radius , pressure , luminosity and temperature , respectively @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a convenient choice of the independent variable , since mass loss is neglected  @xcite .",
    "the first and third equations above are the standard continuity equation and conservation of thermal energy , respectively , whilst the second equation describes the hydrostatic equilibrium ( note that eq .",
    "is equivalent to eq .   when expressed in terms of independent variable @xmath17 ) .",
    "finally , the equations above must be supplied by an appropriate transport energy equation , for the convective zone and for the radiative zone  @xcite . due to the modified poisson equation  ,",
    "the standard equation for the convective energy transport is indirectly modified as follows @xmath18\\frac{t}{p}\\nabla\\,,\\label{convective}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the temperature gradient . for adiabatic changes ,",
    "the temperature gradient can be simply related to one of the adiabatic exponents , @xmath20  @xcite . in the radiative zone",
    ", the transport energy equation is unaffected by @xmath6 and it simply reads @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the rosseland mean opacity and @xmath23 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the modified equations above have been included , together with all the relevant physical processes , in cesam  @xcite , a self - consistent numerical code for stellar structure and evolution .",
    "the main physical inputs of the solar models are the following : the nuclear reaction rates are taken from @xcite , with the  @xcite intermediate screening ; the opacities are taken from the opal95 tables  @xcite for temperatures above 5600  k and from  @xcite for lower temperatures ; we used the tabulated opal eos  @xcite ; microscopic diffusion is included following the prescription of  @xcite ; finally , the solar abundances are taken from  @xcite . for comparison ,",
    "all the models were also computed with the older , low - metallicity solar abundances  @xcite , leading to nearly identical results .",
    "this test stresses the robustness of our approach and shows that our analysis is virtually independent of the current uncertainties of solar modeling .    in order to constrain the values of the coupling parameter @xmath6 which are compatible with present observations of the sun , we constructed calibrated solar models for different values of @xmath6 .",
    "the models are calibrated to fit the solar properties with an accuracy of 10@xmath24 .",
    "the calibration is performed by varying the parameters @xmath25 ( the initial abundance of hydrogen in the young sun ) and @xmath26 ( which parametrizes the efficiency of convection as a mechanism of energy transport ) , and by fixing the solar surface heavy - element content @xmath27 , age @xmath28gyr , radius r@xmath29 cm , mass m@xmath30 g and luminosity l@xmath31erg@xmath32s@xmath33 .",
    "it was possible to construct calibrated solar models for @xmath34 . for @xmath35 ,",
    "no equilibrium stars can be constructed , in agreement to what is shown in  @xcite for simple polytropic models . on the other hand , for @xmath36 equilibrium stellar configurations can be constructed , but their internal structure is so strongly modified that the observed solar properties ( namely @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) can not be matched simultaneously . in table  [ tab : calibrated_models ] , we show the values of @xmath42 and @xmath26 required to calibrate the solar models , together with the central temperature , density and pressure of the models .",
    "it is important to stress that this result does not rule out eddington - inspired theory as a promising alternative to einstein s theory .",
    "previous studies showed that most of the appealing features of the theory would persist even for a ( positive ) arbitrarily small coupling parameter  @xcite , which is perfectly consistent with current observations of solar neutrinos and helioseismology .",
    "modified gravity is also relevant as an alternative approach to the solar abundance problem .",
    "the particular theory we considered only offers a partial solution to this problem .",
    "indeed , models with @xmath48 predict the base of the convective envelope at a smaller radius than the standard solar model , reconciling the prediction with the helioseismically inferred value .",
    "however , the predicted helium surface abundance for the same models with @xmath48 is then even more underestimated than for standard solar models .",
    "similar partial solutions were discussed in different contexts  .",
    "although eddington - inspired gravity suffers from the same limitations , other gravitational corrections could affect the solar interior in a different way and they should be investigated more carefully .",
    "we leave this interesting topic for future work .",
