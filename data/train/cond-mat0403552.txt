    "cell adhesion is based on a large variety of different adhesion molecules , each of which is optimised for its specific biological function @xcite .",
    "most adhesion molecules have evolved to operate under force .",
    "for example , in cell - matrix adhesion , receptors from the integrin family usually function under conditions of cellular contractility @xcite , while in leukocyte adhesion to blood vessel walls , receptors from the selectin family operate under shear flow @xcite . during recent years , single molecule force spectroscopy",
    "has revealed formerly hidden properties of many different adhesion molecules , which in the future might be linked explicitly to their biological function @xcite .",
    "rupture of molecular bonds under force is a stochastic process which can be modeled with kramers theory as thermally activated escape over a sequence of transition state barriers @xcite .",
    "the most convenient loading protocol is a linear ramp of force , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "for single molecules , the most frequent rupture force as a function of the logarithm of loading rate has been predicted to be a sequence of linear parts , each of which corresponding to one transition state barrier along the rupture path @xcite .",
    "this prediction has been confirmed experimentally for many different adhesion systems @xcite , including @xmath0-integrin @xcite and l - selectin mediated bonds @xcite .",
    "although single molecule force spectroscopy has strongly changed our understanding of specific adhesion , cell adhesion is usually not based on single molecules , but on clusters of varying size .",
    "therefore , future understanding of cell adhesion also has to include the cooperative behaviour of adhesion molecules under force . in single molecule experiments",
    ", ruptured bonds usually can not rebind due to elastic recoil of the transducer .",
    "in contrast , ruptured bonds in adhesion clusters can rebind as long as other bonds are still closed , thus holding ligands and receptors in close proximity . for adhesion clusters under constant loading ,",
    "it is well known that despite rebinding , stability is lost beyond a critical force @xcite .",
    "for adhesion clusters under linear loading , force grows without bounds and the cluster will always rupture .",
    "recently , the most frequent rupture force has been measured as a function of loading rate for clusters of @xmath1-integrins and rgd - lipopeptides loaded through a soft transducer in a homogeneous way @xcite .",
    "theoretically , it has been shown before that different scaling regimes exist for cluster lifetime as a function of cluster size , loading rate and rebinding rate @xcite .",
    "for the case of a stiff transducer , force on single bonds is independent of the number of closed bonds and a mean field approximation can be applied to make further theoretical progress @xcite . however , for the case of a soft transducer , force is shared between closed bonds , leading to real cooperativity : if one of the closed bonds ruptures , force is redistributed over the remaining closed ones . here",
    "we present for the first time a full treatment of this case .",
    "we start with a one - step master equation with kramers - like rates , which is solved by monte carlo methods .",
    "these results are then compared to numerical integration of a rate equation for the mean number of bonds .",
    "we show that considerable differences exist between the stochastic and deterministic treatments for small clusters or slow loading . for the case of vanishing rebinding ,",
    "our results confirm the three scaling regimes for cluster lifetime as a function of loading rate , which have been predicted before on the basis of a scaling analysis of the rate equation for the mean number of bonds @xcite .",
    "for the case of finite rebinding , the intermediate scaling regime becomes irrelevant . for slow loading",
    ", we identify a sequence of two new scaling laws , which result from stochastic decay towards an absorbing boundary and finite rupture strength at constant loading , respectively .",

    ", we will consider linear loading , that is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is loading rate .",
    "single closed bonds are assumed to rupture with the dissociation rate @xmath11 , which corresponds to the case of one sharp transition state barrier along the rupture path @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath12 is the internal force scale of the bond set by the barrier .",
    "single open bonds are assumed to rebind with the force independent association rate @xmath13 .",
    "we now introduce dimensionless variables : dimensionless time @xmath14 , dimensionless loading rate @xmath15 and dimensionless rebinding rate @xmath16 .",

    "closed bonds are present at time @xmath19 . the reverse and forward rates between the different states @xmath4 follow from the single molecule rates as @xmath20 for constant force , this master equation has been studied before @xcite . since adhesion clusters ( like single molecules )",
    "usually can not rebind from the completely dissociated state due to elastic recoil of the transducer , we implement an absorbing boundary at @xmath21 by setting @xmath22 .",
    "since force increases in time without bounds , the cluster will always dissociate in the long run , that is @xmath23 for @xmath24 , both for absorbing and reflecting boundaries .",
    "cluster lifetime @xmath25 is the mean time to reach the absorbing state @xmath21 . by defining cluster dissociation rate @xmath26",
