    "photoacoustic imaging ( pai ) is a novel promising tool for visualizing light absorbing structures in an optically scattering medium , which carry valuable information for medical diagnostics .",
    "it is based on the generation of acoustic waves by illuminating an object with pulses of non - ionizing electromagnetic radiation , and combines the high contrast of pure optical and the high resolution of ultrasonic imaging .",
    "the method has demonstrated great promise for a variety of biomedical applications , such as imaging of animals @xcite , early cancer diagnostics @xcite , and imaging of vasculature @xcite .",
    "when an object is illuminated with short pulses of non - ionizing electromagnetic radiation , it absorbs a fraction of energy and heats up .",
    "this in turn induces acoustic ( pressure ) waves , that are recorded with acoustic detectors outside of the object .",
    "other than in conventional ultrasound imaging , where the source of acoustic waves is an external transducer , in pai the source is the imaged object itself .",
    "the frequency bandwidth of the recorded signals is therefore generally broad and depends on the size and the shape of illuminated structures .      throughout this paper",
    "we assume a planar recording geometry , where the acoustic signals are recorded with omnidirectional detectors arranged on planes ( or lines ) , see figure  [ fg : setup0 ] .",
    "the planar geometry is of particular interest since it can be realized most easily in practical applications .",
    "the recorded acoustic signals are then used to reconstruct the initially generated acoustic pressure which represents optically absorbing structures of the investigated object .        for the planar recording geometry ,",
    "two types of theoretically exact reconstruction formulas have been reported : temporal back - projection @xcite and fourier domain formulas @xcite .",
    "numerical implementations of those formulas often lead to fast and accurate image reconstruction algorithms .    in temporal back - projection formulas",
    "the signals measured at time @xmath0 are back projected over spheres of radius @xmath1 with the detector position in the centre ( @xmath2 denotes the speed of sound ) . in fourier domain formulas",
    "this back - projection is performed by interpolation in the frequency domain .",
    "reconstruction methods based on fourier domain formulas are attractive since they reconstruct an @xmath3 image in @xmath4 floating point operations by using of the fast fourier transform ( fft ) .",
    "straightforward implementations of back - projection type formulas , on the other hand , require @xmath5 operation counts , see @xcite .",
    "the standard fft algorithm assumes sampling on an equally spaced grid and therefore , in order to implement the fourier domain formulas , interpolation in the fourier space is required .",
    "interpolation in the fourier domain is a critical issue , and creates artifacts in reconstructed images , see the examples in section [ sec : num ] .",
    "one obtains significantly better results by increasing the sampling density in the fourier space .",
    "this is achieved by either zero - padding @xcite or by symmetrizing the recorded signals around @xmath6 ( which is equivalent to using the fast cosine transform instead of the fft ) . in this paper",
    ", we propose an efficient reconstruction algorithm that uses the nonuniform ( or unevenly spaced ) fft @xcite and further increases the quality of reconstruction .",
    "the nonuniform fft has been applied to a variety of medical imaging problems , such as standard x - ray ct , magnetic resonance imaging , and diffraction tomography @xcite , and has also been used implicitly in gridding algorithms @xcite .",
    "all those algorithms deal with the problem of recovering a two ( or higher ) dimensional object function from samples of its multidimensional fourier transform on a non - cartesian grid .",
    "our approach is conceptually quite different to the above mentioned references : the special structure of our problem allows to perform several one - dimensional nonuniform ffts instead of a single higher dimensional one .",
    "this leads to a reduced numerical cost , compared to the above algorithms .",
    "the proposed algorithm is more closely related to a reconstruction algorithm for x - ray ct suggested in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5.2 ) , which also evaluates the fourier transform on irregular samples by means of the one - dimensional fft .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in section [ sec : problem ] we present the mathematical basics of fourier reconstruction in pai . in section [ sec : nufft ]",
    "we review the nonuniform fft which is then used to derive the nonuniform fft based reconstruction algorithm in section [ sec : fra ] . in section [ sec",
    ": num ] we present numerical results of the proposed algorithm and compare it with existing fourier and back projection algorithms .",
    "the paper concludes with a discussion of some issues related to sampling and resolution in the appendix .",
    "let @xmath7 denote the space of smooth functions with bounded support in the half space @xmath8 , @xmath9 . consider the initial value problem @xmath10 with @xmath11 . here",
    "@xmath12 denotes the laplacian in @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the derivative with respect to @xmath0 .",
    "we write @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and define the operator @xmath18 by @xmath19 photoacoustic imaging for planar recording geometry is concerned with reconstructing @xmath20 from incomplete and possibly erroneous knowledge of @xmath21 . of practical interest are the cases @xmath22 and @xmath23 , see @xcite .",
    "the operator @xmath24 can be inverted analytically by means of the exact inversion formula @xmath25 where @xmath26 , and @xmath27 denotes the @xmath28-dimensional fourier transform , @xmath29 equation ( [ eq : inv ] ) has been derived in @xcite for three spatial dimensions .",
    "it can be proven in any dimension by using the inversion formula for the spherical mean radon transform of @xcite .",
    "a related formula using the fourier cosine transform instead of the fourier transform has been obtained in @xcite for @xmath30 .",
    "the inversion formula ( [ eq : inv ] ) yields an exact reconstruction of @xmath31 , provided that @xmath32 is given for all @xmath33 . in practical applications only a _ partial _ ( or _ limited view _ ) data set is available @xcite . in this paper",
    "we assume that data @xmath34 are given only for @xmath35 , see figure [ fg : setup0 ] , which are modeled by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a smooth nonnegative cutoff function that vanishes outside @xmath38 . using data ( [ eq : data - part ] ) , the function @xmath31 can not be exactly reconstructed in a stable way ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore common to apply the exact inverse of @xmath24 to the partial data @xmath39 and to consider the result as an approximation of the object to be reconstructed .",
    "more precisely , the function @xmath40 defined by @xmath41 is considered an approximation of @xmath31 .",

    "the results of interpolation based reconstruction without oversampling ( @xmath106 ) are quite useless .",
    "the reconstructions are significantly improved by using a larger oversampling factor @xmath61 .",
    "however , even then , the results never reach the quality of the nonuniform fft based reconstruction .",
    "moreover , the numerical effort of linear interpolation based reconstruction is proportional to the oversampling factor , which prohibits the use of `` very large '' values for @xmath61 ( see figure [ fg : performance ] ) . in the reconstruction with @xmath122 ( bottom line in figure [ fg : fcirc-1 ] and middle line in figure [ fg : fphant ] ) artifacts are still clearly visible .",
    "the images in the middle line of figure [ fg : fcirc-2 ] suggest that truncated @xmath109 and nonuniform fft based reconstruction seem to perform quite similar .",
    "however , the differences to the direct fourier reconstructions , shown in the bottom line in figure [ fg : fcirc-2 ] , demonstrate the higher accuracy of the nonuniform fft based algorithm .",
    "the results in figure [ fg : fcirc-3 ] show that all applied reconstruction algorithms are quite stable with respect to data perturbation .",
    "in particular , the filtered back projection algorithm produces images with the highest signal to noise ratio .",
    "however , only at the cost of a nearly 100 times longer computation time ( see table [ tb : performance ] ) .",
    "we presented a novel fast fourier reconstruction algorithm for photoacoustic imaging using a limited planar detector array .",
    "the proposed algorithm is based on the nonuniform fft .",
    "theoretical investigation as well as numerical simulations show that our algorithm produces better images than existing fourier algorithms with a similar numerical complexity .",
    "moreover the proposed algorithm has been shown to be stable against data perturbations .",
    "let @xmath31 be smooth function that vanishes outside @xmath38 , and define @xmath39 , @xmath40 by ( [ eq : data - part ] ) , ( [ eq : inv2 ] ) .",
    "we further assume that @xmath199 is concentrated around zero and , that @xmath31 is essentially bandlimited with essential bandwidth @xmath133 , in the sense that @xmath200 is negligible for @xmath201 .",
    "note that since @xmath31 has bounded support , @xmath202 can not vanish exactly on @xmath203 .    *",
    "* sampling of @xmath39 .",
    "* equation ( [ eq : inv ] ) implies that @xmath204 with @xmath205 if @xmath206 and @xmath207 otherwise . the assumption that @xmath31 has essential bandwidth",
    "@xmath133 and equation ( [ eq : shann - g ] ) imply that @xmath208 is negligible outside the set @xmath209 now shannon s sampling theorem @xcite states that @xmath39 is sufficiently fine sampled if the step size in @xmath210 and in @xmath0 satisfies the nyquist condition @xmath211 . *",
    "* sampling of @xmath40 . * similar considerations as above",
    "again show that @xmath40 is essentially bandlimited with essential bandwidth @xmath133 .",
    "shannon s sampling theorem implies that @xmath40 can be reliable reconstructed from discrete samples taken with step size @xmath211 .",
    "if @xmath31 has essential bandwidth larger than @xmath133 , the function @xmath39 has to be filtered with a low pass - filter _ before _ sampling .",
    "otherwise , sampling introduces aliasing artifacts in the reconstructed image .    theoretically , the resolution ( at least of the visible parts ) can be increased ad infinity by simply decreasing the sampling size @xmath212 . in practical applications , several other factors such as the bandwidth of the ultrasound detection system limit the bandwidth of the data , and therefore the resolution of reconstructed images @xcite",
    "this , however , also guarantees that in practice a moderate sampling step size @xmath212 gives correct sampling without aliasing .",
