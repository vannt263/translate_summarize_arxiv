    "<S> we present arguments aiming at reconciling apparently contradictory results concerning the chemical composition of cosmic rays of highest energy , coming recently from the auger and hires collaborations . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we argue that the energy dependence of the mean value and root mean square fluctuation of shower maxima distributions observed by the auger experiment are not necessarily caused by the change of nuclear composition of primary cosmic rays . they could also be caused by the change of distribution of the first interaction point in the cascade . a new observable , </S>",
    "<S> in which this influence is strongly suppressed , is proposed and tested .    recently </S>",
    "<S> two leading cosmic ray ( cr ) experiments , the pierre auger collaboration ( auger ) @xcite and the high resolution fly s eye collaboration ( hires ) @xcite published their most recent data on the depth of maxima of extensive air showers above @xmath0 ev . </S>",
    "<S> two apparently contradictory conclusions were presented . whereas the auger collaboration cautiously concluded that their data indicated a gradual increase of the average mass of incoming cr with energy , hires stated that their data were consistent with a predominantly protonic composition of cosmic rays . </S>",
    "<S> these results started a vivid discussion @xcite . in this note , we propose a possible reconciliation of both results with an indication that , perhaps , there is no need to introduce a heavy ( i.e. , iron ) component in the cr chemical composition . </S>",
    "<S> namely , we indicate that these results could also be due to the influence of the distribution of the first interaction point in the cascade , at least partially . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore propose and test a new observable , cf . </S>",

    "<S> the auger data @xcite show almost monotonic changes in the chemical composition of cr changing from proton to iron for two types of observables considered : the mean depth of the maximum of the longitudinal development of air showers , @xmath1 , and the shower - to - shower fluctuations , the root mean square ( rms ) @xmath2 , see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , one can deduce from eqs.([eq : xmax ] ) and ( [ eq : rms ] ) , in an univocal way , the corresponding values of observables of interest for a given value of the parameter @xmath6 ; in particular , the energy dependencies of @xmath1 and @xmath7 . the differences @xmath8 are evaluated directly from the definition using the energy dependencies of @xmath9 and @xmath10 as given by the models . </S>",
    "<S> notice that auger compares their data with pure simulations , whereas hires quotes data including all detector effects and compares them to the models _ </S>",
    "<S> after _ the detector simulation . </S>",
    "<S> it means then that , unfortunately , both approaches can not be compared directly . ] for @xmath1 , a such dependence can be interpreted by allowing for the presence of two components in cr : iron , with relative abundance @xmath6 , and protons , with relative abundance @xmath11 : @xmath12 ( where @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote the mean depth of shower maxima for the pure @xmath15 and @xmath16 cr s , respectively ) . however , the same reasoning applied to @xmath17 lead to nonmonotonic dependence on @xmath6 in this case ( seen as nonlinear spacing between lines corresponding to different values of @xmath6 , cf . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig2 ] , for such a simple parametrization , experimental data with similar energy behavior lead to quite different chemical compositions , ranging from proton dominated for @xmath1 to iron dominated for @xmath10 .     and </S>",

    "<S> [ fig1 ] ( in the frame of the qgsjetii model @xcite).,width=453 ]    among possible reasons of such a discrepancy , we shall concentrate on problems connected with the development of the cascade , in particular on the significance of the depth of the first interaction . </S>",
    "<S> it is known ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) that most charged particles in the shower are electrons and positrons with energies near the critical energy @xmath21 originated from the electromagnetic subshowers initiated by photons from @xmath22 decay . </S>",
    "<S> the mean depth of the maximum of an electromagnetic shower initiated by a photon with energy @xmath23 is @xmath24 here @xmath25 g/@xmath26 is the radiation length and @xmath27 mev in the air . </S>",
    "<S> a nuclear - initiated shower consists of a hadronic core which feeds the electromagnetic component mainly through the production of @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in general , for an incident nucleus of mass @xmath28 ( including protons with @xmath29 ) and total energy @xmath30 , the depth of the shower maximum is given by @xmath31\\rangle + \\langle x_1\\rangle , \\label{eq : max}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the mean depth of the interaction with maximal energy deposition into the shower ( known also as the depth of the first interaction ) , @xmath33 denotes inelasticity and @xmath34 is related to the multiplicity of secondaries produced in the high - energy hadronic interactions in the cascade . </S>",
    "<S> when the composition changes with energy , @xmath35 depends on energy and @xmath1 changes accordingly . for primary nuclei with mass number @xmath28 and energy @xmath30 , </S>",
    "<S> the shower is , within a good approximation , simply equivalent to a bundle of @xmath28 nucleons with energies @xmath36 each . in the case of primary protons in the hadronic cascade , there is a hierarchy of energies of secondary particles in each interaction and a similar ( approximately geometrical ) hierarchy of interaction energies in the cascade . in this case </S>",
    "<S> @xmath34 has to be understood as some kind of effective multiplicity without a general straightforward definition . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the inelasticity @xmath33 can also change with energy @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> now , the probability of observing the first interaction in a shower at a depth greater than @xmath37 is @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the interaction length ( and is therefore connected to the cross section , in our case @xmath40[g/@xmath26 ] for cross - section given in [ mb ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is tempting to use directly the exponential distributions of showers with large @xmath42 to calculate @xmath43 ( and the proton - air cross section ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , this can be done only in the case of a perfect correlation between @xmath42 and @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> the fluctuations existing in shower development modify such a relation , leading to @xmath44 where @xmath45 , and @xmath46 accounts for the way the energy dissipation takes place in the early stages of shower evolution ; it is particularly sensitive to the mean inelasticity and its fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the factor @xmath46 depends mainly on the way the energy dissipation takes place in the early stages of shower evolution and is particularly sensitive to the mean inelasticity and its fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> small fluctuations in multiplicity and @xmath33 result in smaller @xmath46 . of secondary particles </S>",
    "<S> leads to a smaller overall fluctuations of the cumulative shower profile of secondaries , i.e. , to smaller factor @xmath46 @xcite . ]    in our case , in the absence of internal fluctuations , all showers would develop between the first interaction point and the maximum in the same amount of matter , @xmath47 , showing perfect correlation between the @xmath42 and @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that their distributions should in this case have exactly the same shape , but shifted by @xmath48 , i.e. , the slope of the @xmath42 distribution , @xmath49 , should be equal to the mean interaction length @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> this relation will , however , be affected by some inevitable intrinsic fluctuations in shower development taking place after the first interaction . in this case , because of fluctuations in @xmath48 , the correlation between @xmath42 and @xmath43 will diminish . </S>",
    "<S> roughly , one can write that @xmath50 , \\label{eq : sigma}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 and the function @xmath52 describes the influence of shower fluctuations after the first ( main ) interaction point . notice that for the probability distribution given by eq.([eq : l ] ) the fluctuation in @xmath43 is @xmath53 </S>",
    "<S> . however , in the case when @xmath43 is interpreted as the main interaction point ( in which the energy deposition to the shower is maximal ) one would obtain a gamma distribution ( instead of eq . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] for the , respectively , auger @xcite and hires @xcite data . </S>",
    "<S> notice that now the hires data , where the distribution of @xmath42 was truncated at @xmath60 ( @xmath61 denotes truncated fluctuations ) , show similar behavior as the auger data . </S>",
    "<S> notice also ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] ) that @xmath62 given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : obs ] ) still depends on models of multiparticle production and is sensitive to the chemical composition of cr ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 initiated showers are markedly different ) . finally , fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 also tells us that the chemical composition can not be the origin of the observation by auger @xcite that @xmath1 rises too slowly with energy and approximates the expectation for primary @xmath16 nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , experimental data seem rather to be in fair agreement with the hypothesis of a proton dominant composition of the primary cr flux ( assuming , of course , that the reference models used are roughly correct ) . within the toy model of primary composition used before ( with only two components : iron nuclei with relative abundance @xmath6 and protons with abundance @xmath63 , cf . </S>",
    "<S> eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : xmax ] ) and ( [ eq : rms ] ) ) we can again evaluate @xmath6 as given by the auger experiment but this time from @xmath64 . </S>",

    "<S> the abundance of iron is roughly independent of energy ( @xmath65 ) and even for the model epos v.1.99 @xcite leading to the maximal abundance of iron , @xmath6 increases with energy rather slowly ( remaining in the interval @xmath66 ) .     </S>",

    "<S> [ fig3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> , width=453 ]    to summarize this part , we learn from fig . [ fig3 ] that the main contribution to the energy dependence of @xmath9 and @xmath67 observed by auger @xcite comes from @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> this , however , can be affected by two factors : the cross section @xmath68 and inelasticity @xmath33 ( in fact , not only by its mean value @xmath69 , but also by its distribution ) . </S>",
    "<S> roughly , @xmath70 , where @xmath55 determines in which of the successive interactions of a projectile the energy deposition to the shower is maximal . </S>",
    "<S> for a uniform inelasticity distribution ( in the maximal possible interval for a given @xmath56 ) , one has @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> as shown recently in @xcite , if gluon saturation occurs in the nuclear surface region then @xmath72 at @xmath73 ev increases more rapidly with incident energy than is usually estimated . </S>",
    "<S> although in @xcite we have argued for an overall decrease with energy of the inelasticity @xmath33 , its increase at energies @xmath74 ev is by no means excluded . </S>",
    "<S> both possibilities require an abrupt onset of some `` new physics '' beyond the standard model , which would be difficult to accept . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth mentioning as an example the elongation rate , which in the case of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : max ] ) is given by @xcite @xmath75 + \\frac{d \\langle x_1\\rangle}{d \\log e}. \\label{eq : d}\\ ] ] as reported in @xcite , auger observes the apparently abrupt change in @xmath76 at energy @xmath77 ev , which could signal some new physics . </S>",

    "<S> however , the auger data above @xmath0 provide the value @xmath82 g@xmath80@xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> it can be shown that such a large value leads to a very strong energy dependence of the cross section , @xmath83 , which seems at the moment to be very unrealistic and contradicts even the scenario of gluon saturation on the nuclear surface recently proposed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a more detailed discussion of this problem is outside the scope of this note . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the center of mass collision energies of the order of few hundred tev observed here are well beyond those to be studied in the foreseeable future at lhc . </S>",

    "<S> as mentioned above the hires data ( which are truncated at @xmath60 ) @xcite show similar energy dependence for @xmath85 as the auger data , c.f . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that , in both cases , the crucial factors are the tails of the @xmath42 distributions . for a small sample , the values of @xmath42 near the maximum of the distribution are preferred , and the estimated mean value @xmath1 differs from the expected value , @xmath86 . to investigate whether the effect observed by auger could be connected to small statistics , notice that , because the distribution of distances of the first interaction is @xmath87 , when calculating @xmath88 one encounters @xmath89 which has a gamma distribution , @xmath90 for small samples one in fact observes the most probable values , which for a gamma distribution is equal to @xmath91 </S>",
    "<S> this means that we can expect that , for a sample consisting with @xmath92 elements one has @xmath93 whereas the true expectation values for the exponential distribution ( obtained for @xmath94 ) is @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , for a sample of @xmath92 elements the estimator @xmath96 is biased by a value of the order of @xmath97 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig6 ] we compare @xmath98 with data of auger , here @xmath99 denotes the value given by the model . because the reference model ( here qgsjet01 ) does not exactly describe the experimental data ( even in the lower energy region , i.e. for large values of @xmath92 ) we use here the simple formula @xmath100 to describe the dependence on @xmath92 . to further illustrate the significance of tails of @xmath42 distributions , we examine the truncated @xmath42 distribution in the interval @xmath101 , cf . , fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig7 ] where @xmath9 , @xmath67 and @xmath102 , evaluated for different @xmath103 , are presented . </S>",
    "<S> notice that @xmath9 and @xmath10 are strongly dependent on the value of @xmath103 . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> their difference introduced in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : obs ] ) above , @xmath104 , is rather insensitive to the cutting procedure used . </S>",

    "<S> when energy increases , the observed dependence shifts towards the higher @xmath103 , proportionally to the increase of @xmath1 with energy , i.e. , the dependence of @xmath107 on @xmath108 remains roughly the same for all primary energies.,width=453 ]    in conclusion , we argue that the spectacular energy dependence of the shower maxima distribution reported by the auger collaboration @xcite is not necessarily ( or not only ) due to the changes of chemical composition of primary cosmic rays . the observed effect ( or </S>",
    "<S> , at least , a substantial part of it ) seems rather to be caused by the unexpected changes of the depth of first interaction , @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the energy dependence of @xmath109 can be affected by a rapid increase of cross section and/or increase of inelasticity in energies above @xmath110 ev . </S>",
    "<S> both possibilities require an abrupt onset of some `` new physics '' in this energy region and are therefore questionable . </S>",
    "<S> the hires data @xcite , where the @xmath42 distribution was truncated and , after that operation , is consistent with the proton spectrum , brings in the possible role of biases of the @xmath42 distribution indicating that the ways of analyzing cr data of highest energy still remains an open problem . </S>",

    "<S> this observable still depends on the model of multiparticle production and is sensitive to the chemical composition of the primary cr .    summarizing , </S>",
    "<S> though the problem of the chemical composition of cr seem still unresolved , we expect that the large spread observed in the results can find an explanation by comparing the different sensitivities to the composition of cr in various observables . a deeper understanding , </S>",
    "<S> both of the hadronic interaction models and of the systematics of data analysis , which could bias the results , is also needed . </S>",
