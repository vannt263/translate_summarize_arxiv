    "astrophysical plasmas are generally in a fully turbulent regime . in particular , the solar wind can be considered as a natural laboratory for studying physical processes of plasma turbulence , whose dynamic scales can not be achieved in laboratory experiments .",
    "collisions in the solar wind are very rare : the particle mean free path is comparable to ( or larger than ) the system size ( @xmath0 au ) .",
    "these properties suggest that small - scale mechanisms should be more complex than one would expect from a fluid ( viscous ) description .",
    "spacecraft measurements generally reveal that the electromagnetic field fluctuations in the solar wind are in a state of fully - developed turbulence @xcite .",
    "the power spectrum of the fluctuating fields manifests a behavior reminiscent of the @xmath1 power - law for fluid turbulence @xcite , where @xmath2 here is the wavenumber obtained applying the taylor hypothesis .",
    "this inertial range turbulence extends to smaller spatial scales down to a range of wavelengths where kinetic effects dominate the plasma dynamics . at these scales ,",
    "different physical processes come into play , leading to spectral shape changes .",
    "the first clear spectral change appears at scales such as the ion inertial length and/or the ion larmor radius @xcite , where the spectrum of the magnetic field gets steeper @xcite . at the range of spatial lengths of the order of the electron kinetic scales the interpretation of the solar - wind observations",
    "is still controversial .",
    "two different scenarios have been recently pictured : a second spectral break with an additional power - law range @xcite and an exponential cut - off @xcite that instead marks the end of self - similarity . in both cases , a theoretical support from self - consistent , fully nonlinear , vlasov models is needed for the interpretation of this complex phenomenology .    this general picture of astrophysical turbulence becomes more complicated because of the multi - component nature of the solar wind .",
    "the interplanetary medium , although predominantly constituted of protons , is also made of a finite amount of doubled ionized helium ( alpha particles ) , together with a few percentage of heavier ions .",
    "several observations @xcite have shown that heavier ions are heated and accelerated preferentially as compared to protons and electrons . moreover , in recent analysis performed on solar - wind data from the helios spacecraft , the link between the signatures of kinetic effects and some important parameters of heavy ions , such as relative speed , temperature ratio and anisotropy , has been investigated @xcite . in these works",
    "the authors pointed out that more significant anisotropies and non - maxwellian features are detected for alpha particles distribution functions with respect to protons .",
    "the evolution of the velocity distribution functions in the solar wind , and the production of kinetic signatures such as heating and temperature anisotropies represent nowadays some of the key issues of plasma physics @xcite .",
    "the two points discussed above , that the kinetic scales have a determinant effect in shaping the turbulent spectra and that the role of secondary ions can not be neglected , suggest that a multi - scale and multi - species self - consistent vlasov treatment of the turbulent solar wind is required .",
    "the detection of the main kinetic processes that , acting on small scales , are responsible for the energy dissipation and the heating production , represents today one of the main challenges for the plasma scientific community . a kinetic description of collisionless plasma turbulence offers the powerful opportunity of giving important insights for the interpretation of `` in situ '' satellite measurements in the solar wind .",
    "in this context , an indispensable and crucial support to investigate the complexity of solar - wind physics is represented by kinetic numerical simulations .",
    "the most widely adopted numerical description of the kinetic plasma physics is represented by the particle in cell ( pic ) methods .",
    "the lagrangian pic approach is based on the integration of the equations of motion of a large number of macro - particles under the effects of self - consistent electromagnetic fields .",
    "the pic simulations have been extensively used for the description of the kinetic dynamics of space plasmas , addressing the problem of wave - particle interaction @xcite , particle heating @xcite and turbulence @xcite .",
    "nowadays , thanks to the fast technological development of the computational resources , the eulerian approach for the numerical solution of the vlasov equation has become accessible as an alternative to the pic approach @xcite .",
    "the eulerian vlasov simulations , in which the time evolution of the particle distribution function is followed numerically in a discretized phase space domain , are significantly more demanding from the computational point of view compared to the pic simulations .",
    "nevertheless , at variance with the pic methods , the vlasov algorithms are mostly noise - free and do not introduce additional ( unphysical ) heating due to the particle noise .",
    "this point can be crucial when dealing with the numerical description of the short wavelengths part of the turbulent cascade , where the energy level of the fluctuations is typically very low and the statistical noise introduced by the pic calculations can possibly cover the physical information .",
    "recently @xcite , an eulerian hybrid vlasov - maxwell code ( hvm hereafter ) has been developed .",
    "this algorithm integrates numerically the vlasov equation in phase space coupled to the maxwell equations for the electromagnetic fields .",
    "the vlasov equation is solved for the proton species , while electrons are treated as a fluid @xcite .",
    "the hmv code has been extensively used for the analysis of the kinetic effects during the evolution of the solar - wind cascade @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite made use of the hmv algorithm to investigate the role of local kinetic effects in plasma turbulence in a 2d-3v phase space configuration ( two dimensions in physical space , and three in velocity space ) .",
    "it has been shown that , nearby the region of strong magnetic activity , the proton distribution function is deformed by kinetic effects displaying significant non - maxwellian features . moreover , in these regions characterized by high magnetic stress , reconnection events can occur locally , as it has been also described in both pic and magnetohydrodynamic simulations @xcite .    as discussed previously , in the solar wind description",
    "it is important to take account of its multi - component nature . for this purpose ,",
    "@xcite have proposed an update version of the hvm code , which includes the kinetic dynamics of heavy ions . in particular",
    ", the authors examined the effects produced by the presence of alpha particles in the evolution of the solar - wind turbulent cascade in the direction parallel to the ambient magnetic field in a 1d-3v phase space configuration .    in the present paper",
    "we discuss the results obtained by the `` multi - component '' version of the hvm code in a 2d-3v phase space configuration . in order to study the turbulent activity in the presence of alpha particles , we adopt an approach similar to the one used by @xcite , extending the above results to the more realistic multi - ion treatment .",
    "as we will discuss in the following , our numerical simulations reproduce several features commonly observed in space plasmas . as the result of the turbulent cascade ,",
    "coherent structures appear in the system , with regions of high magnetic stress where reconnection locally occurs ; in correspondence of these regions the particle distribution functions are heavily distorted , exhibiting a significant temperature anisotropy .",
    "this effect is more evident for alpha particles than for protons , consistent with recent observations in the solar wind @xcite .",
    "we simulate a collisionless and magnetized multi - species ( electrons , protons and alpha particles ) turbulent plasma through the use of the hvm code . within this hvm model , the vlasov equation for proton @xmath3 and alpha particle @xmath4 distribution functions @xcite is integrated numerically in a 2d-3v phase space domain .",
    "electrons are treated as a fluid and a generalized ohm equation , where a resistive term has been added as a standard numerical laplacian dissipation , is considered .",
    "the dimensionless hvm equations are given by @xmath5 the quasi - neutrality approximation @xmath6 is considered , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the electron and ion densities respectively and @xmath9 the ion charge number ( the subscript @xmath10 stands for protons and alpha particles respectively ) . in eq .",

    "it is worth to point out that the power spectra displayed in figure [ fg : spectrum ] present no significant differences with respect to the same spectra obtained through hvm simulations without alpha particles [ see figure 1(b ) in @xcite ] , meaning that the presence of alpha particles does not significantly affect the dynamical evolution of the turbulent cascade . to make a direct comparison of the dynamical evolution of the two ion species , in figure [ fg : comparison ] we show the velocity spectra @xmath72 [ panel ( a ) ] and the normalized density spectra @xmath70 [ panel ( b ) ] for protons ( @xmath68 , black - solid lines ) and for alpha particle ( @xmath69 , red - dashed lines ) .",

    "we found that the temperature anisotropy for the alpha particles shows a certain correlation to the their drift velocity @xmath91 with respect to protons .",

    "@xcite studied correlations of temperature anisotropies and differential ion speed in the solar - wind measurements from the helios spacecraft ; for the case of the alpha particles , they found that @xmath80 increases as the ion differential speed stays below about @xmath94 . beyond this value @xmath80",

    "the alpha - particle velocity distribution appears strongly affected by turbulence and modulated by the local magnetic field topology , manifesting both kinds of anisotropy ; moreover , as it is clear from figure [ 3dalpha ] , the principal axis of the velocity distribution can be both aligned or perpendicular to the local magnetic field .",
    "another interesting feature that can be appreciated in the plots of figure [ 3dalpha ] is the local formation of bubbles in the velocity distribution along the direction of the local magnetic field that resemble the characteristic longitudinal beams of accelerated particles commonly observed in the solar wind data @xcite and in 1d-3v hvm simulations @xcite . in these numerical papers",
    "a possible mechanism responsible for the generation of these beams of accelerated particles has been identified in the resonant interaction of particles with a newly identified branch of electrostatic fluctuations called ion - bulk waves @xcite .",

    "power spectra for protons and for the electromagnetic fields are not too much affected by the presence of alpha particles , while at smaller scales ( at k s higher than the inverse proton skin depth ) , the power spectrum of the alpha density has a steeper slope than that of proton density .",
    "the non - maxwellian features generated during the evolution of turbulence have been quantified through the statistical analysis of the temperature anisotropy in the reference frame of the local magnetic field .",
    "the joint probability distribution of the temperature anisotropies of alpha particles and protons suggests that there is a clear monotonic dependency between alpha and proton anisotropies .",
    "this reveals the occurrence of simultaneous local kinetic instabilities or the influence of the dynamical evolution of one species on the other .",
    "in general , for the parameters studied here , we found that alpha particles develop higher anisotropy than protons .    with the purpose of analyzing the role of kinetic instabilities driven by the relative speed of the two ion species , we evaluated the dependence of the temperature anisotropy of alpha particles on their drift speed @xmath92 with respect to protons . from this analysis",
    ", we found that the temperature anisotropy increases with increasing relative flow speeds up to @xmath102 ( in units of @xmath103 ) .",
    "moreover , the velocity distributions of alpha particles create bumps along the local magnetic field , resembling very common structures observed in the solar wind @xcite .    by comparing our numerical results to recent solar - wind analyses",
    "@xcite , we found a very good quantitative correspondence both for the correlation of alpha particle and proton temperature anisotropies and for the correlation of alpha anisotropy and relative flow speed .",
    "however , it is worth noting that , while the observational studies are carried out on years of solar wind data , that detect plasmas with very different features and in different physical regimes , in our case these correspondences are the genuine results of a turbulent cascade , where locally both the magnetic field topology and the relative motion of different ion flows can be the main sources of kinetic effects .",
    "the results presented in this work significantly reproduce an important part of the complex phenomenology underlying many processes in the solar wind and suggest that a noise - free eulerian vlasov description of a multi - component collision - free plasma plays a fundamental role in the interpretation of the observational data from spacecraft .",

    "<S> hybrid vlasov - maxwell simulations are employed to investigate the role of kinetic effects in a two - dimensional turbulent multi - ion plasma , composed of protons , alpha particles and fluid electrons . in the typical conditions of the solar - wind environment , and in situations of decaying turbulence , </S>",
    "<S> the numerical results show that the velocity distribution functions of both ion species depart from the typical configuration of thermal equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> these non - maxwellian features are quantified through the statistical analysis of the temperature anisotropy , for both protons and alpha particles , in the reference frame given by the local magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> anisotropy is found to be higher in regions of high magnetic stress . </S>",
    "<S> both ion species manifest a preferentially perpendicular heating , although the anisotropy is more pronounced for the alpha particles , according with solar wind observations . </S>",
    "<S> anisotropy of the alpha particle , moreover , is correlated to the proton anisotropy , and also depends on the local differential flow between the two species . </S>",
    "<S> evident distortions of the particle distribution functions are present , with the production of bumps along the direction of the local magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the physical phenomenology recovered in these numerical simulations reproduces very common measurements in the turbulent solar wind , suggesting that the multi - ion vlasov model constitutes a valid approach to the understanding of the nature of complex kinetic effects in astrophysical plasmas . </S>"
