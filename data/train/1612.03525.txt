    "photoelasticity has long been used by engineers to quantify the internal stresses within solid bodies @xcite .",

    "non - crystalline materials such as polymers and glasses can nonetheless be _",
    ", with the degree of birefringence at each point in the material depending on the local stress .",
    "when a photoelastic material is placed between two polarizers and subjected to stress , each region of the material rotates the polarization of light according to the amount of local of stress and the stress - optic coefficient of the material .",
    "this creates a visual pattern of alternating bright and dark fringes within the material , and this pattern depends in a detailed way on the orientation of the polarizers , the shape of the material , and how it is stressed .    before the creation of finite - element computing methods , photoelastic analysis was a key technique for predicting regions of high compressive or tensile stress during the design of manufactured parts . as such",
    ", it has been an important part of engineering practice in both its qualitative and quantitative forms @xcite .",
    "it was therefore inevitable that photoelastic methods eventually be applied to the study of idealized conceptions of granular materials , as was first done by dantu in the 1950s ( using ordered / disordered arrays of glass cylinders @xcite ) and later by @xcite ( in polymer disks ) and @xcite ( in glass spheres ) .",

    "force chains_.            these pioneering experiments played a key role in the physics community s realization that heterogeneous force transmission is of great importance for understanding the mechanics of granular materials . in the past decade , many different experimental teams have used photoelastic force visualization to quantify myriad phenomena . for example , it has been possible to reveal the particle - scale anisotropy of the contact forces @xcite , identify interparticle contacts @xcite , examine particle shape dependence @xcite , test the validity of statistical ensembles @xcite , identify dilatancy - softening @xcite , measure force chain order parameters @xcite , evaluate the grain - scale stresses caused by growing plant roots @xcite , follow slow dynamics under shear @xcite , and quantify fast dynamics @xcite because the photoelastic response is known analytically for circles / ellipses , several of these studies have measured the vector contact forces at every interparticle contact within the granular material @xcite .",
    "this paper first provides a review of photoelasticity and how it can be used to create high - quality images of stress within granular material (  [ sec : photoelasticity ] ) .",
    "these images can be used either semi - quantitatively (  [ sec : semiquant ] ) or quantitatively (  [ sec : theory ] ,  [ sec : solver ] ) , with the later providing a method to determine the vector contact forces for each of many circular particles in the system .",

    "finally , we describe key techniques for building an experimental apparatus (  [ sec : exper ] ) , including resources for the purchase of key components .",
    "this section provides a brief overview of polarized light and photoelasticity , to aid the reader in building a qualitative understanding of the method . a standard optics textbook ( such as @xcite )",
    "can provide quantitative details about polarized light , and the classic two - volume monograph by frocht @xcite provides a comprehensive treatment of photoelasticity as a method .",

    "the chirality of the rotation of the electric field component specifies the direction of polarization .",
    "circularly polarized light is created by the transmission of unpolarized light through a linear polarizing filter which attenuates the electric field components in the horizontal direction , followed by a quarter - wave plate which creates the @xmath0 phase shift between the electric and magnetic fields .",
    "the fast / slow axes of the quarter - wave plate are rotated by @xmath1 degrees with respect to the linear polarizer . ]",
    "electromagnetic waves travel in a direction co - perpendicular to the sinusoidal electric and magnetic fields of which they are comprised ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : polarizedlight]a ) .",
    "linearly polarized light consists of waves which all have the same orientation of their electric fields .",
    "two common ways to generate linearly polarized light are reflection from a metallic surface , and transmission through a polarizing filter ( also known by a brand name , polaroid ) .",
    "these filters consist of a thin sheet of iodine - impregnated polyvinyl alcohol , with polymer chains preferentially - aligned along one axis .",
    "the mechanism through which they polarize the light is that the iodine provides conduction electrons which polarize along the polymer chains and thereby cancel the electric field of the incident light polarized in the parallel direction , but not in the perpendicular direction .",
    "typically efficiencies are to absorb @xmath2% of light in the parallel direction , and transmit @xmath3% of light in the perpendicular direction @xcite .",
    "circularly polarized light consists of electric and magnetic fields that remain mutually - perpendicular , but rotate with constant magnitude with left - handed ( counter - clockwise ) or right - handed chirality ( clockwise ) with respect to the the direction of propagation . to create circularly - polarized light",
    ", light is first linearly polarized and then passes through a quarter wave plate that advances the phase of one polarization with respect to the other .",
    "a quarter wave plate is a birefringent material of chosen orientation ( fast / slow axes ) and thickness matched to the wavelength of interest . the orientation of the fast axis at @xmath4 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : polarizedlight ] ) with respect to the linear polarization determines whether the output is left - circularly polarized ( lcp ) or right - circularly polarized ( rcp ) .",
    "typically , the two optical elements are purchased as a single , fused unit .",
    "note that , unlike linear polarizers , a circular polarizer can be arbitrarily rotated by any angle around the transmission axis with no effect on the filtered light , but can not be flipped over .",
    "the basic principle of a darkfield polariscope is to place a photoelastic sample between a polarizer and an analyzer of the opposite polarization ( e.g. vertical and horizontal linear polarizers , or lcp and rcp circular polarizers ) , viewed in transmission .",
    "sample configurations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : polariscopes ] .",
    "note that care must be taken during the installation of circular polarizers , to ensure that the polarizer and analyzer are both placed with their quarter - wave plates facing the sample .",
    "in each case , initially - unpolarized light becomes polarized after passing through the polarizer .",
    "as the light passes through the sample , the amount of birefringence at each point depends on the local stress state ( photoelasticity ) .",
    "this birefringence causes the light to rotate its polarization as it passes through the sample , and when it exits the sample the polarization has been rotated by a total of @xmath5 degrees .",
    "the light now passes through a final polarizer called the analyzer .",
    "the final intensity of light depends on the local stress in the birefringent sample as well as the orientations of the analyzer . in a stressed sample",
    ", this leads to an image of light and dark fringes ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : modern ] ) .    while both linear and circular polariscopes are possible , there is a practical difficulty with linear polariscopes that limits their utility : in a linear polariscope , there are two possible reasons for fringes to appear : ( 1 ) the photoelastic response of the sample rotates the polarization to match / mismatch the analyzer ; and ( 2 ) if the principal stress of the sample happens to be aligned with the polarizers , it will not be affected by the photoelastic response of the material . therefore , for linear polariscopes , the fringe pattern depends on both the relative angle between the polarizer ( fixed ) and the principal stress ( changes at different locations and times during experiment ) .",
    "for this reason , quantitative work with polariscopes should always be conducted with circularly - polarized light , which provides azimuthal symmetry .",
    "while the resulting image of light and dark fringes depends uniquely on the stress in the sample , there is an ambiguity in the phase .",
    "various groups have proposed various methods to unwrap the phase map of the resulting image to extract the stress in the sample .",
    "however , many images of the sample are needed with different wavelengths of light @xcite and different analyzer orientations @xcite .",
    "these methods must resolve both isochromatics ( associated with magnitude of local stress ) and the isoclinics ( the angle of stress ) . in investigations of granular materials , we are solely interested in the contact forces of each sample , rather than the local stress state itself .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient for contact - force measurements to use an analyzer which has been arbitrarily rotated about its azimuthal axis ( with respect to the polarizer ) ; this results in an image of the isochromatics only . throughout the remainder of the text",
    "we assume images are acquired using the circular polarizers set up as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : polariscopes ] .    generally speaking , the samples in fig .",
    "[ fig : historical ] and [ fig : modern ] illustrate that particles with more force are brighter ( darker ) against a dark ( bright ) background , because the light that passed through them had its polarization rotated . often , this contrasting effect is sufficient to identify general features of stress - transmission within a granular sample .",
    "methods for quantifying these features are described in  [ sec : semiquant ] .",
    "importantly , there is a quantitative , one - to - one mapping between the stress field in the sample and the resulting pattern of fringes @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is possible to solve the inverse problem and use polariscope images to determine the vector contact forces on each particle in the sample .",
    "quantitative methods for performing this inversion are detailed in  [ sec : theory ] and  [ sec : solver ] .",
    "originally , images of the type shown in fig .  [ fig : historical],[fig : modern ] were used for semi - quantitative investigations , without knowledge of the vector contact forces between the particles . even in modern experiments , there is much that can be learned from comparing the spatial patterns of the force chains .",
    "for example , images of the force chains can reveal history dependence via spatial correlations @xcite , the ensemble - averaged response to point forces @xcite , and the principal axis of the response @xcite . by subtracting images taken before / after an event",

    "[ fig : gsquared ] ) that this quantity provides an empirical measure of the 2d stress on the system .",
    "more recently , this has come to be known as the gradient - squared ( @xmath6 ) method , and has been used on the system - scale , chain - scale , particle - scale , and contact - scale to provide a semi - quantitative way to track changes in granular forces ( * ? ? ?",

    "this feature also allows the data to be transformed so that all _ contacts _ ( rather than all particles ) experience force - balance , by simply assigning each contact a force which is the vector average of the two independent measurements .",
    "visualizations such as fig .",
    "[ fig : solutiona ] also provide feedback about improving the resolution and lighting .",
    "for example , the force - inversion technique is limited by resolution and contrast in @xmath98 , and also governed by the number ( and quality ) of initial guesses provided to the algorithm . in the low force limit",
    ", @xmath98 is dark in the center of the disk and contacts appear as small dim spots near the perimeter .",
    "greater image resolution and contrast can improve the accuracy of the contact forces found during optimization .",
    "similarly , the resolution of the image also limits how well large forces are calculated , where fringes can become pixelated .",
    "large forces ( and large @xmath10 ) are more computationally expensive and more / better initial guesses are required to find the correct local minimum for @xmath112 .",
    "several commercially - available materials are available with a uniform photoelastic response .",
    "these generally come in various stiffness and are sold in one of two main formats , sheets or castable liquids .",
    "methods suitable for both formats are discussed below . because of the expense associated with all types of particles , it is advisable to make only a dozen particles in the first batch , and check them between polarizers to determine whether the quality is good enough .",
    "for instance , frozen - in stresses often take the form of a bright ring around the outer edge of the particle when viewed in a polariscope .",
    "it is sometimes possible to eliminate / reduce these stresses by slow , gentle heating over a few days or week .    in designing the particles ,",
    "several geometrical considerations are important .",
    "the granular materials will be most amendable to experimentation when all particles ( disks / cylinders ) stay in a single plane .",
    "this can be achieved by making particles which are wider than they are tall so that they do nt tip over when sheared .",
    "when calculating the amount of material needed , it is helpful to cut at least 25% more particles than seem necessary since it is difficult to make a second , identical batch and particles inevitably become lost or damaged over time .",
    "these are then best replaced by particles made in the same batch as the others to avoid the necessity of particle - specific calibrations .    in humid climates , photoelastic particles will experience some degree of adhesion to themselves and their substrate due to liquid bridging .",
    "one method of reducing this effect is to dust the experiment with a very small amount of baking powder .",
    "[ [ sheet - cutting ] ] sheet cutting : + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the following are common sources of sheet stock .",
    "vishay photostress plus @xcite is a proprietary material with excellent uniformity .",
    "nearly - clear urethane sheets are available from various industrial sources ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and are a cheaper alternative . both of these options come in sheets of various stiffness and thickness , and have optical clarity and uniformity suitable for quantitative measurements .",
    "sheets are available with a small amount of dye , which can improve particle - tracking . although clear cast acrylic ( plexiglas ) is widely available , it is generally is too stiff ( low @xmath34 ) for most granular experiments .",
    "in addition , it is weakly dichroic ( it exhibits polarization - dependent light absorption ) and is therefore not suitable for quantitative photoelastic analysis .        for any sheet material ,",
    "several cutting methods are possible depending on the technical capabilities of the machine shop . for circular particles ,",
    "a skilled machinist can create a custom tool ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : particles ] ) which acts as a spinning disk cutter to create circular particles of a specified diameter and with little waste .",
    "alternatively , a small - sized computer - controlled mill can trace the outside of individual particles and make repeated custom ( non - circular ) shapes .",
    "however , the sidemill tool will waste material in proportion to its diameter . in either case",
    ", the machinist will need to lubricate the cutter with dish soap rather than the usual machine oil , which degrades the polymer . with good lubrication ,",
    "it is possible to create particles with smooth edges all the way down , and no frozen - in stresses .",
    "it is also possible to use a water jet cutter to make custom shapes with little waste if care is taken to minimize the presence of a notch or flap at the starting / ending location .",
    "two simple cutting options , which initially seem promising , are less practical than they might appear .",
    "the use of a punch is ill - advised since these leave a lip at the bottom of each particle .",
    "unfortunately , both photostress and urethane break down due to the heat of a laser cutter and release toxic gases , so these do not work . for a low - cost option , it is instead advisable to simply use a band saw to cut strips and then particles as was done in early experiments @xcite .",
    "[ [ casting ] ] casting : + + + + + + + +    both vishay photostress plus @xcite and urethane ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are also available as a two - part castable liquid .",
    "both formulations are available in a variety of stiffnesses , and can be clear or lightly dyed .",
    "the companies provide protocols for making and releasing molds .",
    "note that in order to achieve bubble - free particles , it is necessary to cure the material under vacuum .",
    "two main polariscope configurations are possible : the light can pass through the granular material once on its way to the camera ( transmission ) or twice ( reflection ) .",
    "the most common configuration is the _ transmission polariscope _",
    ", shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : transpol ] .",
    "if the experiment is horizontal , the upper plate could be omitted but is often included to prevent out - of - plane buckling of the granular layer .",
    "the pair of polarizers may be either of opposite chirality ( darkfield , more common ) or the same chirality ( brightfield ) .    in principle , it does not matter whether the polarizers are inside or outside of the supporting layers . in practice , however , if the supporting layers are themselves made of a birefringent material ( _ e.g. _ acrylic ) , then the polarizers must be placed directly adjacent to the particles to avoid measuring photoelastic effects present in the supporting layer . the camera and lightbox will be placed on either side of this sandwich .",
    "such a configuration has the additional difficulty , however , that the polarizers will become scratched over time .",
    "there are several advantages in arranging the system so that the camera - side polarizer is attached directly to the camera .",
    "first , this avoids the expensive purchase of a second , large polarizing filter .",
    "second , easy - to - use polarizing filters are available for many commercial lenses ( see  [ sec : polarizers ] for details ) .        in some cases ,",
    "a transmission polariscope is undesirable when the supporting layer must be opaque .",
    "this is the case , for instance , for a porous membrane ( frit ) providing air - levitation as in @xcite . to accommodate such situations ,",
    "it is possible to build a _ reflection polariscope _ which requires optical access from only one side of the granular material .",
    "this is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : refpol ] .    to create reflecting particles for use in a reflection polariscope",
    ", a simple method is to coat one side of the particles with silver spray paint ( _ e.g. _ rust - oleum mirror effect ) .",
    "these particles will reflect the incident light and simultaneously flip its polarization .",
    "therefore , a darkfield polariscope results from configuring both the illumination source and the camera with the same chirality polarizer",
    ".      two formats of polarizers are typically available , large sheets and camera - based filters .",
    "care must be taken to identify which polarization is specified , and to select left / right circularly polarized products as desired .",
    "for large sheets , current sources include @xcite .",
    "photography shops sell camera - based filters that are sized and mounted for use on standard cameras lenses .",
    "take care when installing the filters in the polariscope that their orientation is correct . a simple check for a darkfield ( lightfield )",
    "polariscope is to place them face - to - face and rotate one polarizer with respect to the other . when the quarter - wave plates are both facing inwards , rotating either polarizer",
    "will always maintain a dark ( light ) view .",
    "if either polarizer is flipped inside out with respect to the other , then the view will go alternately light and dark as one polarizer is rotated with respect to the other .",
    "note that circular polarizers built for standard photographic purposes will have their quarter - wave plate facing the camera sensor ; this is the wrong orientation for a polariscope analyzer ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : polarizedlight ] ) . to remedy this , simply unscrew the mounting frame and flip the filter over within its holder so that the quarter - wave place faces outwards from the camera .",
    "recall , also , that for a reflecting polariscope , having a polarizer and analyzer with matched chirality ( lcp vs. rcp ) gives a darkfield image .",
    "a final difficulty is that the specific chirality of photographic filters may or may not be provided at time of purchase .",
    "since the fringe pattern for birefringent particles depends on wavelength of light through both the stress - optic coefficient and rotation of the light phase ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : iofxy ] ) , it is best to record monochromatic light for quantitative results .",
    "there are two main ways to do this , either by using a monochromatic light source , or by filtering polychromatic light at the source or at the camera itself .",
    "a very simple method , suitable for non - quantitative studies , is to simply visualize only one of the three rgb ( red - green - blue ) channels of a full - color image . because these channels have a bandwidth of @xmath132  m , quantitative studies using this type of color separation are wise to still use monochromatic light .",
    "this could also be achieved via a monochromatic filter which screws directly onto the photographic lenses , available at any camera supply store .",
    "different lighting solutions are appropriate depending on whether the system is a transmission or reflection polariscope . in either case",
    ", it is better to achieve uniform lighting before collecting data , rather than requiring a post - processing step to equalize the brightness levels across all images . in all cases , it is preferable to use low - temperature lights such as leds or fluorescent bulbs rather than halogens or incandescents which will heat the experiment and change the material properties of the particles and/or their supporting layers .    for a _ transmission polariscope _",
    ", several commercial solutions are available .",
    "common types of lightboxes include artists copy - boards , sign and menu boards , and medical x - ray lightboxes .",
    "led - based boards are typically quite thin and have no ac flicker when running on rechargeable batteries .",
    "a doctor s lightbox , while commonly available used at low cost , uses fluorescent lightbulbs which have significant 60  hz flicker unless they have been specially designed to eliminate this or use an electronic ballast that upconverts the frequency to 20  khz .",
    "it is also straightforward to build a custom lightbox out of low - cost strips of leds which can be cut to length to suit any shape experiment . for a _ reflection polariscope _",
    ", many other options are possible , including colored led spotlights ( either decorative or theatrical ) which provide monochromatic light .    to perform particle - tracking and",
    "photoelastic measurements at the same time , it will be necessary to have at least two different sources of light .",
    "typically , a polarized , monochromatic light source provides the photoelastic image via a polarizing filter placed on the camera .",
    "a non - polarized light source , which will still be predominantly transmitted through a camera - mounted polarizing filter , provides other measurements such as the particles positions .",
    "there are numerous methods for achieving this goal : multiple cameras with different filters and post - processing to align the images , electrically or mechanically triggering different lights in sequence ; placing / removing one of the polarizing filters ; or using rgb color - separation of simultaneous sources within a single camera .",
    "this last option is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : colormultiplexing ] , for which the two images came from the red , green led configuration shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : refpol ] .",
    "this configuration leaves the third color channel ( blue ) available for supplemental use .",
    "for example , it is possible to draw features with an ultraviolet marker that will glow blue when exposed to a blacklight .",
    "this technique has been used to monitor the rotation of particles @xcite , to identify and track a sub - population of particles @xcite , and to outline the edges of very clear particles to improve their detection .",
