    "it was in 1897 when guillame first revealed unusual properties of ferromagnetic fcc iron - nickel alloys with the content close to fe@xmath1ni@xmath2 .",
    "the alloys appeared to be characterized by an extremely low thermal expansion in a wide range around the room temperature .",
    "this is because of this property of having an invariant volume under varying temperature that this alloys have been named invars .",
    "it was shown later on that many other physical and mechanical properties of invars also strongly differ from those of other ferromagnetics .",
    "we mention here among the others : volume magnetostriction , specific heat , elastic constants , electrical resistivity , pressure dependence of the magnetization and the curie temperature .",
    "such an anomalous behavior is observed only in the nearest vicinity of the content specific for invars and may strongly depend on the temperature , pressure , magnetic field and so on ( see , e.g. , review @xcite , and proceedings of the centennial symposium on the invar effect @xcite ) .",
    "many unusual properties of invars can be understood if one considers a possibility of continuous transitions between the collinear ferromagnetic spin state to a non - collinear configuration ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "plastic properties of invars are also anomalous",
    ". it is known for long ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) that the critical resolved shear stress ( crss ) of any alloy grows with lowering temperature .",
    "this growth is explained by a decreasing probability of dislocation detachment from obstacles induced by thermal fluctuations .",
    "the same trend is observed in invars but this growth in invars is at least order of magnitude stronger than in non - magnetic fcc alloys , and several times stronger than even in feni alloys with non - invar contents @xcite . it is emphasized that this anomalously strong temperature dependence of crss in invar alloys , named invar hardening , starts only below the curie temperature .",
    "this fact indicates an active role of the magnetic order in formation of plastic properties of invars .",
    "unique properties of invars resulted in their extremely broad application in numerous fields of technology .",
    "this certainly creates a special interest in studying their plastic properties .",
    "several models suggested for an explanation of the invar hardening will be critically discussed in section ii of this paper .",
    "we try to demonstrate in that section that these models are unfortunately not sufficient for understanding the effect .",
    "section iii describes the model which we propose for an explanation of the invar hardening .",
    "it is based on specific features of the exchange interaction between the electrons forming bonds of dislocations with obstacles .",
    "this exchange interaction in invars appears to be much more important than widely discussed elastic and electrostatic interactions .",
    "all the models , proposed with the aim to explain the invar hardening , take into account the anomalously strong dependence of the local magnetization of invars near edge dislocations on the local pressure .",
    "krey @xcite showed that the direct interaction between local magnetizations near the dislocations is weak .",
    "it is three orders of magnitude smaller than the corresponding elastic interaction .",
    "other magnetic mechanisms , e.g. , magnetic interaction of the dislocations with defects , are also very weak . that is why all the models disregard magnetic mechanisms and account only for exchange interactions varying with a change of the invar magnetization .",
    "it was proposed by echigoya et al @xcite that invar hardening is caused by the so called magnetic friction in the course of dislocation motion . according to this model the part of exchange energy , associated with a dislocation ,",
    "dissipates when the dislocation moves .",
    "it leads to an additional friction , which does not depend on the dislocation velocity . however , there are some doubts as for the effectiveness of this mechanism",
    ". the dislocation energy , including its exchange self energy , is conserved when moving in a translationally invariant crystal .",
    "a dynamical deceleration of dislocations is possible only due to its interaction with various elementary excitations , such as phonons , conduction electrons , spin waves and so on .",
    "such processes lead to a viscous friction which increases with the dislocation velocity and becomes zero for resting dislocations .",
    "there is also a magnetic friction in ferromagnetics caused by interaction of dislocations with magnons .",
    "the calculation @xcite shows that this friction is extremely small even when the dislocation velocities are close to the speed of sound . as for",
    "the slowly moving dislocations observed in experiments @xcite ( their velocity is 8 to 9 orders of magnitude smaller than the sound velocity ) , for them the magnetic friction is negligibly small and can not anyhow affect the plasticity .",
    "flor et al @xcite connect the invar hardening with the increasing activation energy for the kink motion , which is caused by an increase of their exchange energy .",
    "it is , however , known @xcite that the motion of a dislocation in any fcc alloy is controlled by the dislocation detachment from the obstacles rather than by the kink motion .",
    "this makes the starting point of the model @xcite not quite reliable .",
    "an interesting model for the invar hardening was proposed by retat @xcite who assumed that the spins of the electrons localized near the dislocation core are antiparallel to the spins of the electron in the neighboring atoms . this spin orientation realizes , according to @xcite , the minimum of the energy .",
    "if the dislocation moves to the neighboring equilibrium state so swiftly that spins do not have time to relax , then the core spins become parallel to those of the neighboring atoms .",
    "the exchange interaction results in an increase of the dislocation energy and in an effective growth of the peierls barrier . this explains , according to retat , the invar hardening",
    ".    this mechanism can be effective if dislocation velocities are , at least , about several cm / s .",
    "such and even larger velocities are achievable only under strong pulse loads of pure metals when the dislocation deceleration is due to a viscous friction @xcite .",
    "however , the experiments @xcite are carried out under static loads and only slowly moving dislocations appear due to their thermally activated detachment from obstacles .",
    "simple estimates lead to the conclusion that their velocities are less than 10@xmath3cm / s , i.e. , four orders of magnitude smaller than required for the mechanism @xcite to work .",
    "domain walls also play a part in pinning dislocations in invars .",
    "magnetostriction near the domain walls of the ferromagnetics results in long range strains , @xcite , hindering the dislocation motion .",
    "that is why creation of domains at temperatures below the curie temperature may lead to an increase of crss in ferromagnetics , and might have , in principle , produced the invar hardening .",
    "unfortunately , there are several reservations as for the role of the domain walls in the invar hardening .",
    "first , the additional strains produced by the walls ( @xmath4 mpa ) are two orders of magnitude smaller than the crss observed in invars @xcite .",
    "second , these strains are proportional to the coefficients of the linear magnetostriction , and in invars these coefficients do not essentially differ from those in other ferromagnetics @xcite , meaning that the fact that this type of hardening is specific only for invars can not be understood in this way .",
    "third , the invar alloys are soft magnetic materials with low values of the coercive field @xcite .",
    "this indicates a weak pinning of the domain walls by all the lattice defects including the dislocations .",
    "fourth , direct measurements @xcite of the influence of the domain walls on crss in invars do not favor their participation in the invar hardening .",
    "domains characterized by the magnetic momentum along the external magnetic field grow .",
    "this grows diminishes the number of domains walls pinned by dislocations .",
    "therefore , the dislocation path length also grows in the magnetic field .",
    "this leads to an increasing plasticity of the ferromagnetic in a rather weak ( @xmath5 0.01 t ) magnetic field @xcite .",
    "however , the experiments @xcite show that the 0.04 t field , quite sufficient to essentially reduce the number of domain walls , does not have any influence on crss .",
    "we have no other choice as to conclude that domain walls hardly play any part in the invar hardening .",
    "we see that existing models do no provide a convincing explanation of the plastic properties of invars .",
    "we will try in the next section to formulate an alternative model .",
    "the important feature of this model is a strong temperature dependence of the exchange interaction between dislocations and solute atoms ( ni atoms in case of feni alloy ) which allows one to explain the anomalous plastic properties of invars .",
    "we are going to present in this section our explanation of the effect of invar hardening . when carrying out the discussion and numerical estimates we will mainly refer to the fe@xmath1ni@xmath2 alloy , although our model with minor , mainly numerical , corrections is applicable to invars with other contents as well .",
    "the theory of plastic properties of alloys usually considers two main types of the dislocation interaction with defects  elastic and electrostatic @xcite .",
    "the elastic interaction arises if the size of the impurity atoms differs strongly from the host atoms and a strain field is created in their vicinity .",
    "then they interacts with the strain fields of dislocations .",
    "the electrostatic interaction in metals is due to the electric fields created due to a redistribution of charges near a dislocation , which acts on the charge distributions near defects .",
    "both types of the interaction are expected to be very weak in invars , since atoms constituting them have very close sizes and chemical properties .",
    "for example in fe@xmath1ni@xmath2 invar , the size of ni ( 1.24 ) is hardly distinguishable from that of fe ( 1.28  in fcc lattice ) .",
    "therefore , one should not expect any strain field around ni atoms and , no tangible elastic interaction of dislocations with ni atoms is possible .",
    "ni atoms do not also create additional charges , since they are characterized by the same valence and electro - negativity as fe atoms , making the electrostatic interaction between the dislocations and ni atoms also negligible .",
    "however , invar alloys are characterized by a strong spin inhomogeneity .",
    "calculations @xcite of the density of states with oppositely directed spins demonstrate that different atoms in invar alloys possess unsaturated d - states with differing values of the localized magnetic moments .",
    "for example , fe atoms in fe@xmath1ni@xmath2 invars have a 2.5@xmath6 magnetic moment , in contrast to 0.7@xmath6 typical of ni atoms @xcite ; here @xmath6 is the bohr magneton . as a result",
    ", localized spin states are associated with ni atoms .",
    "the authors @xcite consider , so called , `` chemical '' interaction of the dangling @xmath0-bonds of a dislocation cores and impurities .",
    "their calculation shows that the interaction can be very strong , up to 1 ev .",
    "this type of interaction is specific for the edge dislocations and is absent in the case of the screw dislocations .",
    "the screw dislocations can hardly form such bonds , which manifests itself in their much higher mobility observed in the experiments @xcite .",
    "the structure of chemical bonds is known to be largely controlled by the exchange interaction ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is the exchange energy which makes the difference between the chemical bonds formed by electrons with parallel and antiparallel spins .",
    "depending on the sign of the exchange interaction - positive ( ferromagnetic ) or negative ( antiferromagnetic ) - the bond with either parallel or antiparallel spins becomes bonding , whereas the chemical bond with the opposite spin configuration becomes antibonding .",
    "we have recently demonstrated @xcite that considering the role of the exchange interaction in formation of the bonds between obstacles and edge dislocations plays a crucial role in the dislocation dynamics under the influence of a magnetic field .",
    "such an approach allowed us , in particular , to understand the microscopic mechanisms of the electro- and magnetoplastic effects .",
    "here we are going to apply similar ideas for an explanation of the invar hardening .",
    "the exchange interaction between the electrons in the dangling bonds of the dislocation core and the solute atom can be conventionally described as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the exchange integral , while @xmath9 and @xmath10 are spin vectors related to the dislocation and defect electron spins . in a magnetic medium",
    "these vectors tend to orient along the common magnetization vector .",
    "then using the molecular field approximation one can substitute them by their average values and rewrite equation ( [ exchange1 ] ) as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the temperature dependent relative magnetization .",
    "the term , @xmath13 , of the interaction ( [ exchange2 ] ) does not disappear even at @xmath14 .",
    "it is a smooth function of the temperature near @xmath15 and accounts for the correlations between the orientations of the interacting spins which remain nonzero even in the paramagnetic state .",
    "it is quite sufficient for our purposes to represent this smooth function by a constant @xmath16 .",
    "a similar equation has been deduced in reference @xcite .    interaction between defects can be also described by this type of equation .",
    "for example , the interaction between vacancies in @xmath17-fe grows from 0.24 to 0.30 ev when transiting from the para- to the ferromagnetic state @xcite .",
    "this growth is well described when assuming interaction potential ( [ exchange2 ] ) with @xmath18 ev and @xmath19 ev .",
    "it is specific for the invar alloys that the magnetic moments of atoms depend anomalously strongly on the pressure @xcite , decreasing under a positive pressure and increasing under a negative pressure .",
    "the dangling bonds of the edge dislocations are situated in the region of the missed semi - plane , i.e. , they are under the action of a negative pressure .",
    "the same can be said about the @xmath20 atoms whose electrons interact with the dislocation dangling bonds .",
    "the negative pressure results in a growth of both values of the spins @xmath21 and @xmath22 and , hence , the linear approximation for the pressure dependence of the atomic moments near the dislocation axis , results in @xmath23 with @xmath24 . here",
    "@xmath25 is the spin value at zero pressure @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath17 is a material constant . in the region of the missed semi - plane the pressure near",
    "the dislocation is @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the shear modulus and @xmath29 is the poisson coefficient . now substituting equations ( [ moment ] ) and ( [ pressure ] ) into ( [ exchange2 ] ) one gets the exchange interaction of dislocations with atoms in the form @xmath30 where",
    "@xmath31 and @xmath32    when considering conventional ferromagnetics one can describe the relative magnetization using the curie - weiss model according which @xmath33 with @xmath15 being the curie temperature .",
    "however , the temperature dependence of the relative magnetization @xmath34 in invars deviates from the curie - weiss equation ( [ cw ] ) .",
    "this deviation is caused by the coexistence of several magnetic states whose energies are very close to the energy of the ground ferromagnetic state @xcite .",
    "the most important deviation occurs near the curie temperature where @xmath34 does not go to zero but acquires small ( 0.15 to 0.20 ) values and rapidly decreases at higher temperatures @xcite .",
    "here we are interested in the range below the curie temperature where we expect an influence of the magnetic ordering on plasticity . in this temperature range using equation ( [ cw ] ) is a rather rough but reasonable approximation . even at higher temperatures close to @xmath35 this approximation does not cause an essential error since the relative magnetization is small and the energy ( [ exchange2 ] ) is proportional to @xmath36 , making the corresponding correction even smaller .",
    "according to ( [ exchange3 ] ) the temperature dependence of the interaction energy is the stronger the more the value of @xmath37 deviates from one .",
    "this value essentially differs from one only for invar alloys with anomalously large parameter @xmath17 .",
    "for example , the fe@xmath1ni@xmath2 alloy is characterized by @xmath38 ( dyn/@xmath39 @xcite . using the values @xmath40 dyn/@xmath41 and @xmath42",
    ", one gets @xmath43 .",
    "it is known @xcite  that the slightest deviation of the alloy content from the composition fe@xmath1ni@xmath2 results in a decrease of the absolute value of the parameter @xmath44 by an order of magnitude or even more . as a result @xmath45 in non - invar compositions and , hence , for these alloys the potential ( [ exchange3 ] ) depends on the temperature much weaker .",
    "we believe that this is the principle cause of the anomalously strong temperature dependence of crss in invar alloys .    according to the data available in reference @xcite the value @xmath46 of crss depends on the ni concentration as @xmath47 .",
    "such a dependence corresponds to the solid solution hardening model proposed by labush @xcite according which the crss at @xmath48 ( i.e. , the stress necessary to move a dislocation through a random array of obstacles in the glide plane ) is @xmath49 here @xmath50 is the magnitude of the burgers vector , @xmath51 is the line tension of the dislocation , @xmath52 is the area of a lattice cell , @xmath53 is the range of the dislocation - obstacle interaction force , @xmath54 is the maximal interaction force ; @xmath55 for a repulsive interaction , and @xmath56 for an attractive interaction .",
    "if one also accounts for thermal activation processes , equation ( [ crss1 ] ) becomes @xcite @xmath57 ^ { { \\displaystyle{3 \\over 2 } } } ,   \\label{crss2}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is a characteristic temperature at which @xmath59 becomes zero .",
    "the characteristic temperature @xmath58 is proportional to the interaction energy between the dislocation and the obstacle @xcite . as shown above",
    "( [ exchange3 ] ) , this energy itself depends on the temperature in the ferromagnetic state and , hence , the characteristic `` temperature '' may be represented as @xmath60 , & \\mbox{at } t\\leq t_{c } \\\\",
    "t_{0p } , & \\mbox{at } t >",
    "t_{c } \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the value of the parameter @xmath58 in the paramagnetic state .",
    "now we are in a position to consider the influence of the internal magnetic field on plastic properties of invar alloys .",
    "there is a spontaneous magnetization m of about 1 to 2@xmath62a / m which corresponds to an internal magnetic induction @xmath63 t .",
    "this field is strong enough to influence plastic properties of crystals ( see our papers @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it has been demonstrated in these papers that effective concentration of obstacles participating in the dislocation pinning depends on the magnetic field .",
    "we believe that a similar mechanism is responsible for the influence of varying magnetization on the crss in invars .    according to this approach",
    "the binding energy of the bond between a dislocation and a paramagnetic obstacle strongly depends on its multiplicity . in the paper",
    "@xcite we assumed that the singlet state of the bond possesses energy which is lower than in a triplet state , which corresponds to the negative ( antiferromagnetic ) sign of the parameter @xmath8 in equation ( [ exchange1 ] ) . according to our model an external magnetic field",
    "may induce singlet to triplet transitions and lead to an increased population of the @xmath64 state with lower binding energy and , hence , to an increased probability of the dislocation detachment from the obstacles .",
    "the crystal plasticity may , as a result , grow .",
    "the invar alloys which we discuss now are ferromagnetics and it is more natural to assume that the exchange parameter @xmath8 in equation ( [ exchange1 ] ) is now positive ( ferromagnetic ) .",
    "then the triplet state will have a larger binding energy , and magnetic field induced transitions to the singlet state will facilitate detachment of the dislocations .",
    "this process can be described by the same equations as in @xcite .",
    "the opposite sign of the exchange energy does not have any consequences for these equations , since they relate to the dynamics of the system in the resonance region , where the exchange energy is negligible .",
    "but , contrary to the antiferromagnetic case , we assume that the dislocation bond is initially formed in one of three @xmath64 states with equal probability ( 1/3 )",
    ". we should also keep in mind that the difference between the magnetic field @xmath65 and the induction @xmath66 is important in ferromagnetics ( @xmath67kg@xmath68m@xmath69sec@xmath3a@xmath70 is magnetic constant ) . solving equations presented in reference @xcite ,",
    "we look for the probability @xmath71 that , on having passed the resonance region under the action of a magnetic induction @xmath66 , the system remains in one of the three triplet states : @xmath72 where @xmath73 @xmath74 here @xmath75 is the difference of the @xmath37 factors of the two electrons forming the radical pair ( dislocation  obstacle bond ) ; @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the transversal and longitudinal relaxation times characterizing the radical pair .",
    "the typical value of the characteristic field @xmath78 can be estimated to be from several tenths to one tesla .",
    "an obstacle is capable of pinning a dislocation in a ferromagnetic only if the bond between them is in a binding triplet state .",
    "if the radical pair is excited to its singlet state , the dislocation passes such an obstacle freely without `` seeing '' it .",
    "one may say that the effective concentration @xmath79 of active obstacles is proportional to @xmath71 .",
    "this concentration , @xmath79 , is now to be used instead of @xmath80 in equation ( [ crss2 ] ) the temperature dependence of this effective concentration arrises due to the temperature dependence of the local magnetic field which in the lorentz model reads @xmath81 .",
    "substituting it into equation ( [ triplet ] ) one gets @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the saturation magnetization of the ferromagnetic at @xmath48 .",
    "comparing equation ( [ concentr ] ) with our results obtained earlier @xcite one can conclude that the effective concentration of the active obstacles does not in fact depend on the sign of the exchange parameter @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , the fact that the invar magnetic ordering is not purely ferromagnetic but rather a superposition of collinear and noncollinear states @xcite does not play a role here .",
    "this rather complex structure produces a temperature dependent local magnetic moment which is to be used in equation ( [ concentr ] ) .",
    "equations ( [ crss2 ] ) and ( [ concentr ] ) determine the temperature dependence of the crss . if we take the @xmath84 invar alloy , then @xmath85k @xcite , @xmath86 t @xcite , @xmath87 m , @xmath88 m , @xmath89m@xmath90 , @xmath56 .",
    "the values of the other parameters : @xmath91k , @xmath92ev , @xmath93ev , and @xmath94 t , are obtained by fitting equation ( [ crss2 ] ) to the experimental data @xcite .",
    "= 19    fig .",
    "1 exhibits a good agreement of the theory and experiment for these values of the parameters .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the values itself are also quite reasonable .",
    "the above characteristic field @xmath94 t , which corresponds to the typical values of the magnetic induction at which dislocations effectively detach from obstacles , lie between the value @xmath95 t obtained for aluminum @xcite and @xmath96 t for copper @xcite , the @xmath13 and @xmath97 values are close to those ( 0.24 and 0.06 ev ) obtained for vacancies in @xmath44-fe @xcite .",
    "the absolute value of @xmath98 varies at low temperature within the range from 0.15 to 0.72 ev , which coincides with the typical range of the energies of the dislocation  obstacle interaction @xcite .",
    "as has been demonstrated in the above section the invar hardening can be explained by the temperature dependence of the exchange interaction energy in the system of dislocations bound to obstacles .",
    "estimates for fe@xmath1ni@xmath2 invars show that at reasonable values of the parameters there is a quantitative agreement between the experimental data and the theory .",
    "it has been emphasized in the previous section that the main characteristics which really strongly distinguish between fe and ni atoms are their magnetic moments .",
    "this has lead us to the conclusion that a special attention should be paid to the exchange energy contribution to the edge dislocation ",
    "obstacle interaction .",
    "it is demonstrated in this paper that our approach provides a reasonable quantitative description of the invar hardening .",
    "our model represents , as far as we know , the first attempt to consider the influence of the internal magnetic field on plasticity .",
    "since the major part of construction materials are various steels , which are ferromagnetics , these results may be of an importance for developing a microscopic theory of plastic properties of steels .      1 .",
    "crss grows with a decreasing temperature due to the increase of the dislocation",
    " obstacle interaction @xmath98 .",
    "we expect that such a behaviour of @xmath98 should also show up in the amplitude - independent internal friction of dislocations .",
    "it was shown in reference @xcite that the internal friction @xmath99 in alloys varies inversely proportional to @xmath98 .",
    "that is why , one may expect a rapid fall of the quantity @xmath99 at @xmath100 , when the energy @xmath98 starts growing ( see fig .",
    "the temperature dependence of the internal friction @xmath99 is expected to be stronger than linear in contrast to conventional nonmagnetic alloys .",
    "2 .   this paper connects the invar hardening with a strong increase of the magnetic moments created by the @xmath0-electrons in atoms in the vicinity of the dislocation cores .",
    "this , as shown in reference @xcite , causes a strong @xmath101-@xmath0-scattering of the conduction electrons and makes the principal contribution to the dislocation electric resistivity .",
    "hence , one may expect that the anomalous increase of the magnetic moments of atoms near the dislocation cores will result in an anomalously strong dislocation electric resistivity , as compared to other ferromagnetic metals .",
    "a strong temperature dependence of crss in the fe@xmath1ni@xmath2 invar alloy is explained by a large value of the parameter @xmath44 in the dependence of the magnetic moments on the pressure . another invar alloy ",
    "fe@xmath102pt@xmath103  is characterized at the room temperature by the parameter @xmath44 which is factor of 2.2 larger than in fe@xmath1ni@xmath2 .",
    "hence , the invar hardening in this alloy may be expected to by much stronger than in fe@xmath1ni@xmath2 .",
    "4 .   the model proposed in this paper demonstrates the importance of the internal magnetic field in formation of the plastic properties of ferromagnetics .",
    "strong fluctuations of the local magnetic field due to the fluctuations of the magnetization near the curie temperature ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) may cause an enhanced detachment of dislocations from obstacles and an increase of plasticity at this temperature .",
    "the fluctuations of the magnetization on the paramagnetic side of the transition are twice as large as on the ferromagnetic side @xcite .",
    "+ = 19 + + in invars , characterized by an anomalously large magnetic susceptibility , these fluctuations may be especially strong on both sides of the phase transition temperature .",
    "hence , asymmetric peaks , with a larger high temperature shoulder , may appear in the temperature dependence of the plasticity of invars near the curie temperature .",
    "the internal friction of dislocations , which strongly depends on the magnetic field @xcite , may serve as a convenient technique of studying such peaks .",
    "one may expect asymmetric peaks in the temperature dependence of the internal friction near the curie temperature ( see fig.2 ) ."
