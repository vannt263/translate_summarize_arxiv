    "in an earlier paper  @xcite , we emphasized that the angular distribution of the pseudoscalar mesons that arise from the decay of photoproduced vector mesons does not depend on the vector meson s vector polarization , but only on its tensor polarization and that standard single and double spin observables need to be defined in the overall photon - nucleon center of mass frame .",
    "it was also found that a simple description for the decay angular distribution in the @xmath0 c.m .",
    "frame is obtained by using the angle between the decay meson s velocity difference vector and the direction of the photoproduced vector meson .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to formulate a procedure for extracting meaningful spin observables from the analysis of forthcoming vector meson photoproduction data to allow one to examine conventional spin observables .",
    "these spin observables are subject to known rules concerning their forward and backward angular behavior  @xcite",
    ". the nodal structure of spin observables , e.  g. , their production angle dependence , might reveal important underlying dynamics such as baryonic and mesonic resonances .    here",
    "we show how to extract meaningful spin observables under the assumption that analysis of the photoproduction of vector mesons will yield a vector meson rest - frame density matrix . since new data are not yet available , we invoked older 1968 aachen et al .",
    "information  @xcite and found that some of their vector meson rest - frame density matrix results , when transformed to spin observables in the photon - nucleon center of mass frame , violated basic constraints and therefore need to be rejected .",
    "the grounds for that rejection was that some of their elements , even including their stated uncertainties , yielded non - positive , and therefore unacceptable angular distribution functions .",
    "that observation , which we subsequently found to be related to a set of constraints deduced by others earlier  @xcite , led us to examine the various constraints based on the positivity of the density matrix .    in sec .",
    "ii , we analyze the limits on the tensor polarization provided by the simple requirement that the angular distribution of the decay mesons be a positive definite function",
    ". simple limits on the tensor polarizations follow from evaluating the decay angular distribution at selected angles . in sec .",
    "iii , the limits on observables due to positivity of the density matrix are discussed . in sec .",
    "iv , constraints on the vector meson s density matrix due to daboul s analysis  @xcite using schwarz inequalities , are invoked and analyzed .",
    "the schwarz inequalities described by daboul can be re - expressed as four separate conditions on spin observables .",
    "however , all but two of these conditions are already contained in the simple requirement that the angular distribution should be positive definite .",
    "the two remaining conditions involve not only the tensor polarization , but also the vector meson s vector polarization .",
    "these conditions could also be used to limit the vector meson s vector polarization . finally , in sec .",
    "v the method for extracting spin observables from actual data is outlined .",
    "use of these basic constraints should be included in the fitting procedure to assure that general requirements concerning the angular dependence of spin observables , especially at forward and back angles , are satisfied and could then be used to deduce interesting new dynamics .",
    "in photoproduction of a vector meson ( @xmath1 ) on a nucleon target the final vector meson decays into two pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "the angular distribution of the decay provides information about the spin - state of the vector meson .",
    "however , only information about the tensor polarizations @xmath2 can be obtained .",
    "the angular distribution of the pseudoscalar decay mesons is given by  @xcite : @xmath3 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{4 \\pi } \\xi_v(\\bar{\\theta } ) \\ , [ 1 -   \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2 } } t^v_{20 } ( 3 \\cos^2 \\bar{\\theta } - 1 ) + \\sqrt{3}\\ t^v_{2 1}\\ , \\sin 2\\bar{\\theta } \\cos \\bar{\\phi } -   \\sqrt{3}\\ , t^v_{2 2}\\ , \\sin^2 \\bar{\\theta } \\cos 2\\bar{\\phi } ] .",

    "use of these angles simplifies the expression for the angular distribution in the overall photon - nucleon center of mass frame in which spin observables are defined .",
    "note that the spin observables @xmath9 depend on the vector meson production angles @xmath10 as well as on the total c.m .",
    "the factor @xmath11 which arises from describing the vector meson decay in the overall center of mass system and from a density of state factor , is given by : @xmath12 where @xmath13 are the vector meson s mass and energy .",
    "the decay angular distribution @xmath14 does not depend on the vector meson s vector polarization and as shown above includes only the vector meson s tensor polarization .",
    "once the angular distribution is measured and vector meson rest frame density matrices are provided , it is necessary to map that data over to the angles @xmath15 one can then project out the vector meson s tensor polarization from the normalized ratio @xmath16 as described in sec .",
    "v.    the tensor polarization must take on values that allow the angular distribution function @xmath14 to be positive definite . by selecting the angles",
    "@xmath17 one can use that obvious condition to extract allowed limits for the tensor polarization . in the first and second columns of table",
    "i a list is given of specific choices of angles @xmath17 and the resulting conditions on @xmath18 such constraints also arise from direct conditions on the density matrix , as will be seen in sections iii and iv .",
    "thus from table  i , we see that the simple requirement that the decay angular cross section be positive yields limits on the possible tensor polarization .",
    "we now consider other ways to recognize constraints on the spin observables and the associated density matrix . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the constraints on @xmath2 that follow from the positivity of the density matrix .",
    "recall that for a general observable @xmath19 the classical ensemble average is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the positive definite probability for finding a beam particle pointing in the direction stipulated by the euler angle label @xmath22 note that the above is a classical average , with the quantum effects isolated into the expectation value for each beam particle @xmath23    the spin density matrix of the vector meson is defined as @xmath24 where @xmath21 is non - negative .",

    "let us define  @xcite a set of vectors @xmath28 by its elements in @xmath29 space @xmath30 the elements @xmath31 of the density matrix can now be written as dot - products in @xmath29 space of the set of vectors @xmath28 , @xmath32 now for any vector @xmath33 @xmath34 which displays the positive definiteness of @xmath26 .",

    "this becomes @xmath46    if the vector @xmath33 in eq .",
    "( [ semiproof ] ) is such that the combination @xmath47 is symmetric under the exchange of @xmath48 and @xmath49 the obtained constraints are similar to the constraints derived in the previous section for a positive decay angular distribution .",
    "the constraints in that case involve only the tensor polarizations @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and not the vector polarization @xmath52 .",
    "this is because symmetric combinations @xmath47 only pick out the symmetric part of the density matrix @xmath31 , i.  e. , in this case the part that has even rank .",
    "the antisymmetric rank - one part of @xmath26 , which is due to the vector polarization , then gives no contribution to @xmath53 .",
    "this is exactly the symmetry selection made if one considers the decay angular distribution of section ii , and which was discussed in detail in ref .",
    "the resultant linear constraints are listed in columns 1 and 3 of table  i.    even relations involving the vector polarization @xmath52 can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ semiproof ] ) , if the above symmetry restrictions are not invoked on @xmath47 .",
    "however , the resulting linear constraints involving @xmath52 are only of academic interest because @xmath52 can not be measured from the decay angular distribution .",
    "these additional constraints are therefore not listed in this paper .",
    "additional constraints on the density matrix are obtained using schwarz inequalities as described in ref .",
    "namely , from the previously derived eq .",
    "( [ dotproduct ] ) and @xmath54 follows @xmath55 similar constraints exist for differences or sums of matrix elements @xmath31 .",
    "such constraints were exploited in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this case",
    ", two additional inequalities can be derived    @xmath56    and @xmath57    from eqs .",

    "( [ hermiticity ] ) and the property that the diagonal matrix elements @xmath58 , and @xmath59 are non - negative or @xmath60 @xmath61 some of the schwarz inequalities collapse to linear conditions @xmath62 @xmath63 however , one also finds two very useful quadratic conditions that involve the squares of @xmath52 and @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66 the resulting restrictions on the observables are listed in columns 1 and 4 of table  i and table  ii .",
    "as one can see , the obtained linear rules are equivalent to those discussed earlier .",
    "again we omit from table  i linear conditions that include @xmath52 .",

    "@xcite collaboration measured the reaction @xmath67 using an unpolarized photon beam and an unpolarized proton target .",
    "the final proton recoils when a @xmath26 meson is produced and the @xmath26 subsequently decays into @xmath68 and @xmath69 mesons , both of which are detected .",
    "hence , the angular pion distribution in the final state is measured .",
    "a fit to this angular distribution in the @xmath26 meson rest - frame yields three density matrix elements from which we can reconstruct their pion angular distribution in the @xmath26 meson rest frame .",
    "this reconstructed decay pion angular distribution is called @xmath70 , where @xmath71 define the direction of @xmath68 in the @xmath26 rest frame .",
    "the above pion angular distribution depends on the spin state of the produced @xmath26 meson , which is described by a @xmath72 spin density matrix @xmath36 .",
    "the angular distribution only depends on the three real elements @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 .",
    "values of these elements in the rest frame of the @xmath26 meson are published by aachen et al .",
    "@xcite for a set of several photon beam energies and vector meson production angles .",
    "in order to study reaction mechanisms , however , we are interested in spin correlations(single and double spin observables ) that are defined in the overall center of mass frame .",
    "how does one obtain spin correlations from these previously published density matrix elements ?",
    "our aim is to use the aachen et al .",
    "data in the form of @xmath70 to obtain the pion angular distribution in the photon - nucleon center of mass frame and re - analyze it in terms of the spin correlations .",
    "if one or more particles in the reaction are polarized  @xcite , such future data can be analyzed in a similar way to extract meaningful spin correlations .",
    "our procedure is therefore preparation for analysis of future experimental results from thomas jefferson laboratory with polarized photons  @xcite .",
    "the first step is to obtain the angular distribution @xmath70 in the @xmath26 meson rest frame from the values of the elements @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 using @xmath76\\ .",

    "frame the variables are @xmath80 and @xmath81 , where @xmath82 are the angles between the relative velocity of the two decay pions in the @xmath78-nucleon c.m .",
    "these angles are related to the angles of the decay meson in the vector meson s rest frame by : @xmath83 and @xmath84    the next step involves including the known kinematic factor @xmath85 in @xmath86 see eq .",
    "( [ ksi ] ) . aside from the overall factor of @xmath85 ,",
    "the remaining angular behavior is expressed as a series in spherical harmonics : @xmath87 .",
    "\\label{wpi } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] next we define @xmath88 using eq .",
    "( [ wpi ] ) and @xmath89    finally , we project out the three spin observables , i.  e. , the three tensor polarizations of the vector meson , @xmath90 , from @xmath88 using spherical harmonics @xmath91 s .",
    "these spin observables can then be studied as function of photon energy and the vector meson production angles @xmath92    once the spin observables are properly defined and have correct production angle dependence , one can visualize the role of the tensor polarization in 3d displays of the decay angular distribution .",
    "examples are given in fig .",
    "4 for the case of @xmath93 and positive @xmath94 and in fig . 5 for the case of @xmath95 and negative @xmath96 with in both cases",
    "@xmath97 in fig . 6 , a more realistic case , based on ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath98 and @xmath99 is shown ; namely , for @xmath100 one can therefore associate a shape of @xmath101 with each point in the allowed @xmath102 space .    in the process of carrying out these steps , we found four cases of the aachen data that do not satisfy the constraints in tables  i and ii .",
    "therefore those sets had to be rejected .",
    "subsequently we found another author had also rejected some of the data  @xcite using similar general constraints .",
    "it would therefore be best to incorporate these constraints directly into the data analysis .",
    "for analysis of experimental data for vector meson photoproduction one should describe the resulting angular decay distribution in the overall @xmath0 c.m .",
    "frame instead of in the commonly used vector - meson rest frame . in the c.m .",
    "frame , one should use the angles @xmath82 of the relative velocity vector @xmath103 . in the transformation from the vector - meson rest frame to the @xmath0 c.m .",
    "frame , and due to the use of the angles @xmath104 a kinematical factor @xmath105 of eq .",
    "( [ ksi ] ) needs to be included .",
    "furthermore , constraints should be satisfied by the observables @xmath2 .",
    "all of these constraints can be derived from the positivity of the density matrix .",
    "we have also explored restrictions which follow from positivity of the eigenvalues of the spin density matrix @xmath26 such as the conditions that @xmath106 and trace@xmath107 \\leq 1 $ ] , see ref .",
    "the relations obtained from these restrictions are respectively cubic and quadratic in the spin observables and involve the vector meson s vector polarization @xmath52",
    ". a more complete set of relations can be obtained by exploring the explicit forms of the roots @xmath108 of the eigenvalue equation of @xmath109 we impose the conditions that @xmath110 @xmath111 and @xmath112 for example , one root is @xmath113 . from @xmath114 relations",

    "the allowed regions are shaded .",
    "( 1 - 3 ) refer in each case to 2-dimensional subspaces and only those constraints are shown that are independent of the values of the observable that would play the role of the third dimension .",
    "the full 3-dimensional representation of constraints is richer .",
    "we close with some remarks about double spin observables . for a polarized photon beam again the angular distribution of the decay mesons can be measured .",
    "this decay distribution now depends on the single spin observables @xmath90 as well as on the double spin correlations @xmath123 ( ref .",
