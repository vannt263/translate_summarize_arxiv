    "note that for a bounded set @xmath14 , @xmath15 means that @xmath16 is the restriction of a @xmath17-map defined on @xmath5 .",
    "the usual proofs of this theorem that one finds in advanced calculus textbooks involves careful estimates of volumes of images of small cubes under the map @xmath12 and numerous annoying details .",

    "this restriction was also removed by lax in @xcite .",
    "then , tayor @xcite and ivanov@xcite presented different proofs of the about result of lax @xcite using differential forms , see also @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will present a simple elementary proof of theorem [ t1 ] .",
    "our approach does not involve the language of differential forms .",
    "the idea is motivated by excerise 15 of  1 - 7 in the famous textbook on classical differential geometry @xcite by do carmo .",
    "the excerise deals with the two dimensional case @xmath23 .",
    "we will perform an induction argument to generize the result to the higher dimensional case @xmath24 . in our argument",
    ", we will apply the cauchy - binet formula about the determinant of the product of two matrics . as a byproduct of our approach",

    "to start with , we consider the two dimensional case @xmath23 . as noted in lax @xcite , using an approximating argument , it suffices to consider the case that @xmath25 and @xmath26 . for explicity , we assume that@xmath27 since @xmath25 , we can choose @xmath28 such that @xmath29 , for example we may extend @xmath30 to be zero outside @xmath31 and set@xmath32 let @xmath33 .",

    "since the signs in are not depent on the function @xmath30 , and @xmath43 is of constant sign in @xmath4 , choosing @xmath44 in we see that the signs should be chosen such that@xmath45 the proof of theorem [ t1 ] for @xmath23 is completed .",

    "we will define the integral over a hypersurface ( of codimension one ) in @xmath5 .",

    "we only prove the theorem for the case that @xmath3 is simultaneously @xmath83-type for all @xmath101 . for a general @xmath6-vector field @xmath102 on @xmath31 , we set @xmath103 . since @xmath104 , and @xmath105 is @xmath83-type ,",

    "we have the following theorem .",
