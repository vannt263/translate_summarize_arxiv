    "since the power - law attenuation is slower than the exponential attenuation , these oscillations should become dominant at large times , and should theoretically become observable .",
    "however , by the time this happens , the level of the oscillations may well become too low due to the attenuation , making a practical detection of this branch of oscillations rather difficult .",

    "the presented analysis relies on several assumptions discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , of which perhaps the most critical ones are the assumptions of collisionless plasma and of the sharp perfectly reflecting boundary confining the plasma .",
    "while relaxing the former assumption does not change the results qualitatively  @xcite , relaxing the latter assumption may change the results dramatically .",
    "firstly , the smooth boundary leads to a new resonant damping of surface oscillations , dramatically increasing the exponential damping rate @xmath132 in ( [ eq : rho(t)_poles ] )  @xcite . secondly , allowing for boundary smoothness ( with a simultaneous account for the quantum tunneling , as they both have the same spatial scales )",
    "should change the analytic properties of @xmath59 in the lower semiplane @xmath81 of complex @xmath37 plane , and thus may change its branch cuts and their contribution into ( [ eq : inv_laplace ] ) .",
