    "ion - induced nucleation in water vapor plays a decisive role in many atmospheric phenomena .",
    "it is well - known that the nucleation rate is much enhanced in polar fluids in the presence of ions @xcite .",
    "however , precise experiments on this effect have been difficult despite the long history of this problem since wilson s cloud chamber experiment @xcite . theoretically , we need to understand statistical behavior of polar molecules around an ion @xcite and heterogeneous nucleation triggered by such ion - dipole interaction in metastable states .",
    "this problem is thus of fundamental importance in physics and chemistry , but it has rarely been studied in the literature .    originally , thomson @xcite calculated the chemical potential of vapor in the vicinity of a charged particle using continuum electrostatics and predicted formation of a small liquid droplet with the ion at its center .",
    "however , its radius is only @xmath0 in room - temperature water vapor , so thomson s picture is an oversimplified one .",
    "recently , ion - induced nucleation has been studied using a density functional theory @xcite , a monte carlo method @xcite , and molecular dynamics simulations @xcite .",
    "these numerical studies have shown clustering of polar molecules around an ion and alignment of the dipoles along the electric field .",
    "after the statistical average , the first effect gives rise to a density inhomogeneity @xmath1 or electrostriction around an ion .",
    "it is worth noting that born calculated the solvation free energy due to an ion in continuum electrostatics , accounting for polarization alignment ( in the linear response ) but neglecting electrostriction @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to present a ginzburg - landau theory of ion - induced nucleation in polar one - component fluids in a gas phase .",
    "it will be based on our recent theory of solvation effects in near - critical polar binary mixtures @xcite",
    ". our theory will take account of both electrostriction and polarization alignment . as will be discussed",
    ", the born formula becomes a poor approximation in strong electrostriction , particularly when an ion is in a gaseous polar fluids .",
    "merits of our approach are its simplicity and its ability to describe mesoscopic effects such as nucleation . in section 2 a theoretical background of solvation will be presented . in section 3",
    "the free energy increase to create a critical droplet around an ion will be calculated in a gaseous polar fluid .",

    "then we find @xmath120 to obtain r_shell ~(a/_)^1/4 , which can exceed @xmath81 for @xmath121 .      due to the large density variation around an ion in gas , the effect of electrostriction",

    "+ ( i ) we use a simple continuum model , where the electrostatic free energy is given by eq.(2.5 ) and the grand potential increase due to an ion is given by eq.(2.15 ) or eq.(2.18 ) .",
    "particularly , we use the harris - alder formula ( 2.7 ) for the dielectric constant as a function of the density and the van der waals form for the helmholtz free energy density in eq.(2.8 ) . the density profiles around an ion are numerically obtained as illustrated in figs.3 and 7 .",
    "+ ( ii ) we have proposed the droplet free energy @xmath180 in eq.(3.6 ) for a large liquid droplet in a metastable gas with an ion at its center .",
    "it is remarkable that the difference of solvation in gas and in liquid gives rise to the negative background contribution @xmath190 , which much favors nucleation around an ion in a metastable gas . + ( iii ) the nucleation barrier @xmath141 has been calculated in three manners .",
    "in our ginzburg - landau scheme we have directly sought an unstable solution of eq.(2.21 ) to obtain the points ( @xmath209 ) ( ko ) in figs.9 and 10 .",
    "it may also be calculated more approximately using eq.(3.5 ) ( ko ) or the first line of eq.(3.16 ) ( thomson ) .",
    "they yield the solid lines and the dotted lines in figs.9 and 10 , respectively .",
    "we have found that the ko result is close to the directly calculated result ( ko ) for relatively large critical radius @xmath143 if the background is chosen to be @xmath190 .",
    "+ ( iv ) we have presented the density profiles in figs.4 and 7 , which go to zero at the ion center owing to the pair potential @xmath75 . however , we have obtained essentially the same results for the free energy barrier @xmath141 in fig.9 without @xmath75 and in fig.10 with @xmath75 .",
    "finally we make some remarks .",
    "+ ( i ) we have used the ginzburg - landau theory with the simple gradient free energy .",
    "however , far from the critical point as in the case of @xmath82 , the density functional theory @xcite with a nonlocal pair interaction would give more improved results .",
    "+ ( ii ) because of its simplicity we have used the macroscopic linear dielectric formula ( 2.7 ) even very close to the ion .",
    "this has been the approach in the previous continuum theories@xcite , but it is not well justified . in particular , we should examine the effect of nonlinear dielectric saturation in solvation , which gives rise to a decrease in the effective dielectric constant close to the ion @xcite .",
    "+ ( iii ) the difference @xmath140 of the solvation free energies in eq.(2.28 ) is a relevant parameter generally in ionic solutions in two - phase states , although the present work has treated the case of a single ion . for example , it gives rise to ion - density differences inside and outside a wetting layer .",
    "+ ( iv ) obviously @xmath141 tends to zero on approaching the critical point .",
    "however , this is the result for a single ion .",
    "we point out that even a small concentration of ions can drastically alter the phase behavior of near - critical polar fluids @xcite .",
    "+ ( v ) we can also construct a theory of ion - induced nucleation in binary fluid mixtures @xcite .",
    "+    we would like to thank m. anisimov for valuable discussions and providing us a copy of the article by fernandez _",

    "here we consider the surface tension @xmath79 in the absence of ions in our model in the mean field theory @xcite . to have a planar interface we assume that the fluid is on the coexistence curve or the pressure is given by @xmath223 with the temperature below @xmath34 .",
    "the grand - potential density g(n)= f(n)- _ cxn+ p_cx is minimized at @xmath224 and @xmath225 on the coexistence curve with the minimum value being zero . for our van der waals free energy @xmath226 in eq.(2.8 ) and the gradient free energy in eq.(2.15 )",
