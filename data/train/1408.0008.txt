    "thermoelectrics are a subject of great interest to industry for their many applications as macro and micro - scale peltier coolers , their waste - heat energy recycling potential ( heat - to - electricity conversion ) in industrial and consumer products , and their application as highly sensitive compact and robust sensors.@xcite an academic interest has also persisted as the optimization of thermoelectric efficiency offers an intriguing challenge in which ostensibly mutually exclusive physical properties must be combined in one material for the greatest performance .",
    "this is illustrated by the figure of merit @xmath4 , where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 are the seebeck coefficient , the dc conductivity , and the thermal conductivity , respectively .",
    "for high thermoelectric efficiency , @xmath5 and @xmath6 must therefore be simultaneously enhanced , while @xmath7 is deliberately suppressed .",
    "this is a nontrivial task , considering the intimate link between the parameters that define @xmath8 .",
    "for example , both @xmath6 and @xmath7 depend on the carrier lifetime @xmath9 , while both @xmath5 and @xmath6 are a function of the band dispersion .",
    "hence , the improvement of each individual quantity could result in an overall decrease of @xmath8 , thus making experimental techniques that can disentangle the common limitations of each quantity highly desirable .    currently , the primary methods of studying thermoelectrics are by dc transport , optics , thermopower experiments and neutron scattering,@xcite where the standard drude model is often employed to extract temperature dependent information about carrier lifetimes .",
    "a major shortcoming of the drude model , however , is the assumption that the carrier lifetime is frequency independent .",
    "when analyzing optical data , this often results in poor quality drude fits , and carrier scattering rates with large uncertainties .",
    "a solution to this shortcoming is the application of the _ extended _ drude analysis to a sample s optical response.@xcite while commonplace in the optical investigation of strongly correlated systems,@xcite the extended drude model offers some benefits previously unexplored in the context of thermoelectrics .",
    "using this approach grants access not only to the temperature dependence of the carrier lifetime , but also to its frequency dependence , shedding light on the various scattering mechanisms that govern @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , with both high temperature and energy resolution,@xcite broadband ( far infrared through visible ) optical spectroscopy provides direct access to the free carrier plasma frequency and band mass , both affecting @xmath5 and @xmath6 , as well as spectral weight transfers and band transitions , useful for studying band gaps and band inversions .    to illustrate the versatility of this approach we ve performed our measurements on pb@xmath0sn@xmath1se",
    ", a compound combining the thermoelectric characteristics of its thoroughly studied binary constituents pbse and snse@xcite however , unlike its constituents , previous works on pb@xmath0sn@xmath1se crystals have shown evidence of a temperature dependent band inversion , although neither the exact transition temperature , nor the temperature dependence of the gap has been identified conclusively .",
    "this is largely a result of limited energy and temperature resolution of the experimental probes that were used , with various reports ranging between 80 k and 200 k. @xcite hence , broadband optical spectroscopy provides a unique opportunity to study , in a very controlled manner , how carrier dynamics change throughout the inversion .",
    "moreover , many traditional thermoelectric probes , such as transport and seebeck measurements , rely on band structure models to extract the scattering rate .",
    "such band structure assumptions are severely complicated by the band inversion , further motivating the investigation of pb@xmath0sn@xmath1se by optical spectroscopy as features of the band inversion and the carrier lifetime can be measured independently in a single experiment .",
    "this discriminating quality becomes even more evident by considering previous transport studies of the pb@xmath10sn@xmath11se system .",
    "while pb@xmath10sn@xmath11se alloys have been studied for 50 years,@xcite only specially prepared low - carrier extrinsic p - type pb@xmath0sn@xmath1se was found to show abrupt changes in the dc transport properties across the band inversion.@xcite interestingly , as - grown n - type crystals showed no clear signatures of the band inversion at all . a recent paper by liang et al .",
    "highlighted this peculiarity and was the first to show evidence of the band inversion in n - type pb@xmath0sn@xmath1se , employing nernst and thermopower experiments.@xcite particularly for device applications , a thorough understanding of the electronic properties of both n and p - type crystals is pivotal.@xcite + the temperature dependent band inversion of pb@xmath0sn@xmath1se has also received significant attention from the topological insulator community . it was recently shown that while pbse is a trivial insulator , snse is a topological crystalline insulator ( tci ) ; a state of matter in which crystal point group symmetry protects the persistence of gapless surface states with a spin polarized dirac dispersion.@xcite interestingly , in pb@xmath0sn@xmath1se we have the unique opportunity to tune between topological and trivial phases by temperature , rather than doping , thus negating the effects of disorder . moreover , since it is challenging to perform arpes and stm ( the primary methods of studying surface states ) at various temperatures , temperature dependent broadband spectroscopy makes a great tool for the investigation of surface states in topological ( crystalline ) insulators.@xcite we note that since band gaps are typically tuned by electron - phonon coupling and anharmonicity , the concurrent band inversion and topological phase transition hints at a more subtle process .",
    "hence , pb@xmath0sn@xmath1se can reveal new insights into how anharmonicity , electron - phonon coupling and topology all interplay .",
    "+ in the present work , we measure the temperature dependent broadband reflectance of pb@xmath0sn@xmath1se between 5 k - 292 k , and extract its optical conductivity and dielectric function between 6 mev - 6 ev .",
    "subsequent extended drude analysis reveals the frequency dependent free carrier scattering rate , and is used for a precise determination of the dominant temperature dependent scattering mechanism .",
    "we find clear optical evidence of the band inversion temperature at @xmath2 k , by studying the free carrier plasma frequency and direct optical band gap transitions .",
    "interestingly , the temperature dependent free carrier scattering rate shows no signatures of the band inversion , and follows @xmath3 behaviour in accordance with electron - acoustic phonon scattering .",
    "finally , we find that the fermi level lies deep in the conduction band ( @xmath12 mev ) , obscuring the observation of surface states,@xcite and causing the seebeck coefficient and power factor to be insensitive to the band inversion .",

    "cleaving by tape was also attempted , but proved unsuccessful in producing high quality surfaces .",

    "[ fig : pssfig1]a ) .",
    "reflectance data below 12 mev were corroborated by repeating the measurements using synchrotron radiation and a custom designed sample chamber with a closed cycle cryomech cryostat at the ailes beamline of the soleil synchrotron in france .",
    "all infrared data were complemented by partially overlapping room temperature ellipsometry measurements between 0.75 mev - 6 ev .",
    "using reffit , a simultaneous variational dielectric fit ( vdf ) of reflectance and ellipsometry data yielded all kramers - kronig consistent optical constants .",
    "all measurements were performed on two different crystals from the same sample batch , showing excellent qualitative resemblance ( see inset fig .  [",
    "fig : pssfig1]a for the reflectance of sample 2 ) .",
    "hence , data from only one crystal are discussed .",
    "[ fig : pssfig1]b shows the real part of the optical conductivity @xmath16 of pb@xmath0sn@xmath1se in the far and mid infrared .",
    "the spectra are dominated by a distinct drude peak below 125 mev , associated with free carrier conductivity , and separated by a cut - off frequency @xmath17 from the interband transitions above 125 mev .",
    "the simplest approach to understanding the spectral range below @xmath17 is to apply the semi - classical drude model , in which the complex dielectric function for the free carrier response is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the bare plasma frequency , @xmath9 is the transport lifetime , and @xmath20 captures all contributions to the dielectric function other than the drude conductivity ( i.e. interband transitions and polarizability of the static background ) .",
    "the bare plasma frequency is defined as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the carrier density and @xmath23 is the band mass .",
    "an immediate consequence of this model is the large , low frequency negative contribution to the real part of the dielectric function ( @xmath24 ) due to the free carrier response . indeed from eq .",
    "[ eqn : drude ] it can be seen that in the limit @xmath25 the zero - crossing of @xmath14 corresponds to the screened plasma frequency @xmath26 , which is related to the bare plasma frequency @xmath27 through @xmath28 .",

    "the temperature dependence of both @xmath19 and @xmath20 are discussed next .    before analyzing the spectra in detail ,",
    "it is useful to consider what we expect to observe as a result of the band inversion . for compounds in which the chemical potential is located in the bulk gap ,",
    "a distinct signature of a band inversion would be the spectral weight redistribution from interband transitions to the drude conductivity .",
    "as the gap closes , the onset frequency of the interband transitions ( roughly @xmath13 in fig .",
    "[ fig : pssfig1]c ) moves to lower energy , until it merges with the drude when the gap size reduces to zero .",
    "however , since stoichiometric pb@xmath0sn@xmath1se is naturally n - type ( chemical potential in the conduction band , shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : pssfig2]b illustrates how the band inversion could be deduced from signatures in @xmath16 .",
    "region i is dominated by free carrier behaviour , described by eqn .",
    "[ eqn : drude ] . hence , as the band dispersion transforms across the band inversion ( fig .",

    ". one might also expect the inversion driven changes in the electronic structure to be reflected in the carrier lifetime .",
    "this can be seen from the width of the lorentzian features ( centred at 0 ) , while deviations from the lorentzian lineshape indicate an energy dependent lifetime .",
    "region iii can be used to extract the magnitude of the direct gap transitions @xmath33 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pssfig2]a . with the chemical potential ( @xmath34 ) in the conduction band , the smallest allowed @xmath33",
    "is offset from the conduction band minimum .",
    "hence , changes in the band dispersion as well as @xmath22 are likely to affect @xmath33 , resulting in a shift of the interband transition onset in @xmath16 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pssfig2]b .",
    "since @xmath20 is a measure of the spectral weight in @xmath35 above the free carriers , this quantity too should reveal signatures of the band inversion , similar to @xmath33 .",
    "finally , below @xmath33 , region ii is sensitive to temperature dependent changes in indirect gap transitions @xmath36 , where @xmath37 , as well as impurity scattering responsible for an extended @xmath33 onset ( known as an urbach tail@xcite ) .",
    "the spectral weight of the drude feature ( area under @xmath35 ) is a direct measure of the bare plasma frequency squared , @xmath38 , and was determined by integrating @xmath16 up to a cut - off point @xmath17 using @xmath39 where @xmath17 separates the drude contribution to @xmath40 from the interband transitions ( as indicated in fig .",

    "[ fig : pssfig2]c and [ fig : pssfig2]d , respectively . starting with @xmath38",

    "[ eqn : wp ] corresponds to an integration of the density of states ( @xmath43 ) multiplied by the fermi function ( @xmath44 ) , so that @xmath45.@xcite evaluating this integral using the sommerfeld expansion yields a temperature independent term equal to @xmath38 at 0 k , and a negative @xmath46 term as a result of thermal smearing of the fermi function .",
    "hence , the temperature dependence of the squared plasma frequency is expected to follow @xmath47 where @xmath48 depends on @xmath43 at the fermi energy.@xcite interestingly , while a linear decline in @xmath38 vs @xmath46 is expected , fig .",
    "[ fig : pssfig2]c shows two distinct regimes in its temperature dependence below and above @xmath2 k. since @xmath48 is a function of the density of states , this is a clear signature of an abrupt change in the band dispersion , associated with the band inversion . indeed , this critical temperature falls within the 80 k - 200 k temperature range over which the band inversion was previously observed.@xcite this also provides a first indication that despite the fermi level of n - type pb@xmath0sn@xmath1se not being in the gap , discontinuities in its optical properties are a useful probe in the exact determination of its band inversion temperature .",
    "besides clear signatures of the band inversion in @xmath38 , we also expect to see a change in @xmath20 at @xmath2 k. since @xmath20 is a measure of the spectral weight of all interband transitions , it is sensitive to temperature dependent changes in the band structure.@xcite this is confirmed by ( fig .",

    ", the seebeck coefficient is given by@xcite @xmath119 ( where @xmath31 is the conduction of valance band mass ) , which can be expressed as a function of @xmath115 ( using eqn .",
    "[ eqn : efder1 ] ) as @xmath120 since @xmath34 is located high in the conduction band , the direct gap transitions are likely only minimally sensitive to changes in the true band gap @xmath57 ( and thus @xmath121 ) as a function of temperature .",
    "this is illustrated in the left and right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : pssfig2]a , showing a similar band dispersion for high @xmath34 despite a dramatic change in the band gap .",
    "hence , we can estimate the maximum change in @xmath117 by attributing the temperature dependence of @xmath122 ( see eqn .",
    "[ eqn : directgap ] ) entirely to changes in @xmath123 .",
    "the result of this estimation , after substituting @xmath123 for @xmath115 in eqn .",
    "[ eqn : seebeck ] , is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : pssfig5]a , while fig .",
    "[ fig : pssfig5]b shows the associated power factor @xmath124 .",
    "it is clear that neither @xmath5 nor @xmath124 show distinct signatures of the band inversion at @xmath2 k. these results suggests that there is room for optimization of the figure of merit @xmath8 in pb@xmath10sn@xmath11se compounds where @xmath34 is located deep in the conduction band .",
    "further doping to alter the lattice and suppress phonon contributions will likely only affect the electronic response minimally , as illustrated by its insensitivity to the band inversion and the unaffected power factor .",
    "in conclusion , we have performed broadband optical spectroscopy experiments on as - grown n - type pb@xmath0sn@xmath1se and extracted its optical constants over a temperature range between 5 k and 293 k. by studying the plasma frequency and band gap transitions , we find clear signatures of the temperature dependent band inversion at @xmath2 k , despite the chemical potential being far in the conduction band .",
    "we note that since temperature is an easily controllable variable in optical spectroscopy , in principle this could be used to optically determine band inversion temperatures of conductive samples with extremely high precision .",
    "while this band inversion is also associated with a topological phase transition,@xcite we do not see any signatures of surface states , and thus do nt comment on the topology of the band structure on either side of the band inversion .",
    "this is an expected result , however , as optical modelling suggests that the highly conductive bulk carriers dominate the properties of as - grown pb@xmath0sn@xmath1se .    by performing extended drude analysis",
    ", we accurately determine the temperature dependent scattering rate , and find that it follows @xmath3 behaviour ( associated with electron - acoustic phonon interactions ) typical for good thermoelectrics,@xcite superimposed on a constant impurity scattering background with @xmath125 mev .",
    "the frequency dependence of the scattering rate shows no evidence of different scattering channels below and above the band inversion , but data over a greater energy and temperature range are required for more conclusive results . moreover , neither the dc resistivity , seebeck coefficient , or the power factor show any evidence of the band inversion .",
    "this result confirms earlier transport studies on similar compounds , @xcite and emphasizes the utility of optical spectroscopy in the study of thermoelectrics and/or band inversions .",
    "for application of pb@xmath0sn@xmath1se as either a topological crystalline insulator or thermoelectric , the high electrical conductivity of bulk states is a major prohibitive factor .",
    "moreover , some of the fundamental physics governing the electronic , thermal , and topological properties are difficult to probe due to the high chemical potential in as - grown pb@xmath0sn@xmath1se .",
    "hence , future studies on samples in the pb@xmath10sn@xmath11se series , in which the carrier density has been reduced , could lead to new insights into the interplay of phonons , thermal and electronic bulk lifetimes , and the optical and electronic properties of inversion symmetry protected topological surface states .",
    "a reduction of the chemical potential would also enhance the sensitivity of the seebeck coefficient to the band inversion , which could potentially result in a dramatic enhancement of the figure of merit @xmath8 around the band inversion .",
    "moreover , alternative stoichiometries also offer an interesting avenue , as previous measurements suggest that the band inversion in pb@xmath10sn@xmath11se could be pushed to higher temperatures -relevant to many thermoelectric applications- by increasing the sn content.@xcite hence , by optimizing se doping , an ideal pb@xmath10sn@xmath11se stoichiometry can be determined , in which @xmath8 peaks around a desired temperature range .",
    "indeed , such doping studies would also allow for the study of the high temperature interplay between the topologically nontrivial phase and thermoelectric efficiency , which is a direction currently unexplored .    with both thermoelectrics and topological ( crystalline ) insulators offering numerous appealing applications in industry ,",
    "while presenting nontrivial physical characterization and optimization challenges , a better understanding of fundamental physics governing the figure of merit @xmath8 and the isolation of surface conductance are both of practical and fundamental interest .",
    "the pb@xmath10sn@xmath11se and pb@xmath10sn@xmath11te series offer many exciting opportunities in this pursuit , particularly through optical investigations , by combining several novel physical phenomena into a single temperature tuneable system .",
