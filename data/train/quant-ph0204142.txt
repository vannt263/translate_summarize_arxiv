    "in a recent paper , knill , laflamme , and milburn ( klm ) showed that efficient quantum computation is possible using only linear optical elements , ancilla photons , and post - selection based on the outcome of single - photon detectors @xcite . roughly speaking",
    ", measurements made on the ancilla photons will project out the desired logical output state provided that certain measurement results were obtained , which only occurs for some fraction of the events .",
    "additional events can be accepted as well if single - bit corrections ( phase shifts and bit - flips ) are applied to the output qubits based on the results of the ancilla measurements , which increases the overall probability of success . here",
    "we report the experimental demonstration of feed - forward control operations of this kind that were used to increase the probability of success of a simple quantum logic operation from @xmath0 to @xmath1 .",
    "an example of a simple feed - forward control process is illustrated in figure [ fig : basicidea ] . here the results of measurements made on a single ancilla photon are used to apply one of two possible single - qubit transformations to the output .",
    "it can be seen that the feed - forward control process required for probabilistic quantum logic gates is similar to the unitary transformations that would be required for a complete implementation of conventional quantum teleportation @xcite , given the results of a bell - state measurement .",
    "feed - forward control would also be needed for a variety of other quantum optics proposals ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",

    "since the temporal width of the down - converted photon wavepackets and their propagation time through the 10 cm long pockels cell can be considered negligible , the results of figure [ fig : delays ] indicated the need for a minimum delay @xmath5 of roughly 100 ns for our system .",
