    "how to understand the evolution of cooperative behavior has interested researchers for decades .",
    "evolutionary game theory @xcite provides a powerful framework and effective methods for studying the emergence of cooperation . among many game models , the public goods game ( pgg ) @xcite  which can be viewed as a generalization of the prisoner s dilemma with pairwise interactions @xcite",
    " serves as a paradigm for discovering the mechanism of cooperative behavior both in theory and experimental settings @xcite . in a pgg",
    ", players are required to decide simultaneously whether or not to invest in the common pool , i.e. , to cooperate or to defect .",
    "all participants share the public resource equally irrespective of their individual contribution . obviously , individuals obtain a better one - shot game payoff if they invest nothing into the public goods . a selfish population which overexploits the public goods",
    "will finally be trapped in the `` tragedy of the commons '' @xcite . though the existence of selfishness and competitiveness in human society , field studies and experiments have verified the fact that humans are willing to cooperate if the conditions are appropriate @xcite .",
    "many mechanisms were put forward to enhance cooperation in social dilemmas .",
    "for example , social diversity @xcite and voluntary participation in pgg turned out to be a simple but viable means to overcome this difficulty @xcite .",
    "reward ( rewarding cooperators at personal cost and benefiting cooperators ) and punishment ( punishing defectors by paying a cost and diminishing the defectors ) are both effective ways to promote and sustain cooperation which , on the other hand , raises the problem of so called second free riders who exploit the additional contributions of rewarding players and punishers @xcite . punishment is a mechanism that can facilitate altruism also in animal societies @xcite .",
    "however , almost all the previous published works based on pgg assumed that the total payoff is shared equally among all the members engaged in the game whatever strategies they selected .",
    "it is no surprise that the traditional way of payoff distribution used in pgg can not provide positive incentive for players to cooperate if no other mechanisms exist .",
    "recently , liu and guo proposed a new model consisting of three competing strategies , i.e.  persistent cooperation , pure cooperation and defection @xcite , aiming to address the enigma : why cooperators would choose to punish defectors at personal cost . in their model ,",
    "cooperators invest in the public goods at personal cost while defectors contribute nothing .",
    "only a proportion of the total payoff is shared among all members , which is different from the traditional way used in pgg .",
    "the contributors who are willing to pay a second cost to retrieve the remaining part of the profit invested by themselves are called persistent cooperators ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the model is discussed in well - mixed populations where all the individuals meet each other at random with equal probability .",
    "the persistent cooperation strategy can evolve under somewhat strict conditions .",
    "however in practical situations the populations are often structural , and individuals have little chance to interact with anyone randomly and they can only contact with their neighbors in a certain range .",
    "many researchers have devoted efforts to the study of evolutionary games in spatially structured populations @xcite , whereby space can both facilitate and suppress the evolution of cooperation @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the model of persistent cooperation in lattices , which  albeit being the simplest type of a structured population ",
    "provide an even field for competing strategies where already the possibility of network reciprocity is given @xcite .",
    "for this reason , lattices enjoy significant popularity in game theoretical models @xcite , and , regardless of their difference to the actual social networks @xcite , they give us a very helpful entry point for studying the impact of the structure on the evolution of cooperation @xcite .    the remainder of this the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ] , the game models on lattices are introduced in detail , and then simulations and theoretical analysis of the evolutionary dynamics of the strategies are presented for one - dimensional lattice in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "the phase diagrams of stationary states , the evolution of frequencies and spatial patterns for strategies on square lattice are provided in section [ sec4 ] . in section [ sec5 ] ,",
    "a summary is made based on the analysis and computer simulations in previous sections .",
    "the pgg is arranged on a lattice with periodic boundary conditions to remove the edge effect .",
    "each player on site @xmath1 initially is designated either as a cooperator ( @xmath2 ) , a persistent cooperator ( @xmath0 ) or a defector ( @xmath3 ) with equal probability . players play the game with @xmath4 immediate neighbors around them , i.e. , each individual is the focal player of the group he ( or she ) belongs to . using standardized parameters here ,",
    "both @xmath0-players and @xmath2-players invest an amount 1 into the common pool , while defectors contribute nothing .",
    "the sum of all contributions is multiplied by a factor @xmath51 , reflecting the synergic effects of cooperation .",
    "let @xmath6 be the payoff that an @xmath7player earns , if he interacts with @xmath8 persistent cooperators , @xmath9 cooperators and @xmath10 defectors .",
    "the overall payoff per game round is divided in two stages : in the first stage , only a fraction @xmath11 of the resulted benefit is shared equally among @xmath12 participators irrespective of their strategies .    in the second stage",
    ", the remaining proportion of the total income @xmath13 is divided into two parts : one part @xmath14 contributed by the persistent cooperators will be retrieved by themselves with persistent efforts at a second personal cost @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the proportion of defectors and @xmath17 .",
    "thus in this stage each persistent cooperator gets the payoff @xmath18 .",
    "in contrast , the pure cooperators are unwilling to bear any additional cost to receive a part of deserved payback @xmath19 , so this part of payoff is again ( not equally ) shared among cooperators and defectors .",
    "each defector gets @xmath20 , a cooperator reaps @xmath21/n_c$ ] . here",
    "we assume that the @xmath0-players have no intention to share the @xmath22 part of the payoff contributed by the cooperators .",
    "therefore , the total payoff for each player engaged in the game are : @xmath23n_d}{n+1 } % \\end{split } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\label{eq9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that the second cost @xmath15 is directly proportional to the frequency of the defectors @xmath16 . in a biological setting , in a population of lions and hyenas , lions pay a first cost to kill buffalos .",
    "however , they have to pay a second cost to fight hyenas for keeping the prey from being robbed @xcite .",
    "the value of the second cost depends on the number of hyenas , and determines the future action of lions : persisting or giving up .",
    "the parameter @xmath24 in @xmath25 represents the degree of the second cost ( persistent cooperating ) and it is not necessarily identical to 1 .",
    "the strategy @xmath0 will be less and less favored by selection if the value of @xmath24 becomes larger and larger . with the increase of @xmath26 ,",
    "the defectors get more and more benefit from the pgg without any cost , they fare better than the cooperators and the persistent cooperators , thus , all the players in the group are prone to become `` free riders '' .",
    "such transitions perhaps lead to tragic consequences as in normal pgg . in the following sections , we investigate the evolution of the competing strategies in dependence upon @xmath26 and @xmath24 for typical synergic factor @xmath27 .",
    "all simulations are initialized with a uniform spatial distribution of the three strategies , and we perform a random sequential update where each monte carlo step ( mcs ) is defined as follows :",
    "a randomly selected player @xmath1 plays the pgg with @xmath4 neighbors in a group composed of @xmath8 persistent cooperators , @xmath9 cooperators and @xmath10 defectors , and obtains his payoff .",
    "one of the @xmath4 nearest interacting partners of @xmath1 is selected at random , denoted by @xmath28 , and obtains his payoff .",
    "player @xmath1 imitates the strategy of @xmath28 with probability @xmath29 .    in this `` pairwise comparison ''",
    "@xcite , @xmath30 corresponds to the inverse temperature in statistical physics , acting as selection intensity .",
    "this choice of @xmath31 also resembles the `` logit rule '' employed to model human choice behavior @xcite . as @xmath32 ( weak selection",
    ", the payoff has little effect on the strategy selection ) @xcite , @xmath33 , selection becomes neutral . if @xmath34 ( strong selection ) , we arrive at @xmath35 , or @xmath36 , depending solely on the sign of the payoff difference , hence the `` pairwise comparison '' updating rule becomes deterministic , indicating that an individual always adopts his neighbor with higher income and refuses to imitate one with lower payoff @xcite . in our simulation , without losing generality , we set @xmath37 , implying that better performing individuals are readily to be imitated . by the finite choice of @xmath30",
    ", we never exclude the situation that a player adopts the strategy of an individual performing worse than him .",
    "it is known that the system size can influence the dynamics to a large degree , so we have confirmed our model in different linear system sizes , e.g. , 1000 , 4000 , and 10000 for one - dimensional lattice , and the equilibrium needs up to @xmath38 full monte carlo steps .",
    "for the square lattice , we perform simulations on two different system sizes @xmath39 and @xmath40 , reaching the equilibrium needs up to @xmath41 full monte carlo steps .",
    "the resulting phase diagrams have similar distributions in the phase planes .",
    "these simulations indicate that our results are robust in even larger systems .",
    "we perform numerical simulations on a one - dimensional lattice of size 500 , where each focal individual has @xmath42 adjacent neighbors and on its left and right side , respectively .",
    "[ fig1]a illustrates the full phase diagram based on @xmath26 and @xmath24 .",
    "the synergic factor @xmath27 is 2 .",
    "it can be seen that the phase plane is partitioned into four regions denoted by the symbols of strategies that survive in the final equilibrium state , @xmath43 ( the coexistence of strategy @xmath0 and @xmath2 ) , @xmath44 ( the coexistence of strategy @xmath0 and @xmath3 ) and @xmath3 .",
    "the regions of the defectors and the cooperators ( @xmath0 and @xmath2 ) are almost equal .",
    "if @xmath45 , i.e. , less than half of the total profit is shared among all the players , although the defectors can exploit the pure cooperators , their incomes are cut down by the @xmath0-players , so the defectors vanish in this region due to their low fitness . with the increasing of @xmath26 , defectors get more and more payoff , whose income are higher than that of the cooperators , hence , the @xmath2-players give way to the defectors .",
    "the battle of territory remains between the persistent cooperators and the defectors .",
    "the narrow region denotes the coexistence of strategy @xmath0 and @xmath3 .    a representative cross - section of ( a ) at @xmath46 illustrating the frequencies of @xmath47 and @xmath0 in dependence on @xmath26 is shown in fig .  [ fig1]b .",
    "if @xmath48 , the battle among the three strategies ends up with the dominance of the persistent cooperators . when @xmath49 , the defectors come up , whose frequency increases from zero to one quickly . while @xmath50 , the defectors win the game , the persistent cooperators disappear completely",
    "[ fig1]c is a spatial pattern of the model indicating how the three strategies evolve within 400 full mcs . starting from a random initial design ,",
    "the cooperators vanish soon in the competition due to their lower income .",
    "so the battle mostly occurs only between the persistent cooperators and the defectors .",
    "players with the same strategy form compact clusters quickly to fight against their opponents .",
    "we find that the variations of the evolutionary dynamics are not remarkable between two adjacent full monte carlo steps .",
    "the main reason is that there are countable boundaries in one - dimensional lattice - structured population .",
    "the transitions of strategies only take place at the boundaries of these tight clusters , so most of the individuals have little opportunity to interact with their opponents once the clusters have established .",
    "the frequencies of two adjacent interacting pairs of players with different strategies ( e.g. , @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) approach zero since the interface density decays with time with a scaling that depends on the type of update @xcite .",

    "owing to their higher benefit , the @xmath0-players perform better than the defectors .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0-players govern the whole population . with increasing @xmath26 ,",
    "the @xmath0-players fail to crowd out the defectors .",
    "the pure cooperators are more impressionable to be exploited by the defectors than the persistent cooperators because of their lower gain and small synergic factor @xmath27 , they give way to the defectors .",

    "the @xmath0-players lose their superiority in the competition . hence all players transform their strategies and turn to be `` free riders '' .    a typical cross - reference of fig .",

    "if @xmath142 , the suppression of treacherous actions is so powerful that it enables not only the reproduction of persistent cooperators but also the compatibility of traditional cooperators .",
    "it is necessary to point out that the @xmath0-players get the same harvest as @xmath2-players in the absence of defectors , and the two types of cooperating individuals imitate each other with probability 0.5 , now the model can be viewed as a voter model @xcite .",
    "so , when @xmath26 is less than the critical value as described above , after the defectors are driven out , the whole system either falls in a homogenous state of @xmath143 or a mixed state of @xmath0 and @xmath2 occasionally according to the initial state which is in accordance with the phase diagrams . while @xmath144 , the @xmath0 individuals occupy the population and the frequency of @xmath2 becomes 0 due to the exploit by the defectors .",
    "if @xmath26 hits the threshold value 0.555 , defectors appear , and the frequency of @xmath3 increases from 0 to 1 monotonously . though the @xmath0-players remain alive , the amount of them reduces sharply to zero during a short time .",
    "each individual then choses to be a defector if @xmath145 .",
    "this can be verified by analyzing the snapshots of strategies distribution in fig .",
    "we use a specially prepared initial state similar to that in @xcite , which has three distinct interfaces among the three strategies . to gain insight into the influence of @xmath0 and the evolution of the three strategies over time , we may focus on the movements of these interfaces that separate the three strategies .",

    "[ fig5]a , it is clear that the qualitative characteristics in fig .  [ fig8]a remain intact to a large degree . similar to the observations found for @xmath136 , again here we detect a wide region of the coexistence state of @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "one of the most remarkable differences between the two diagrams , is of course the expansion of the coexistence region of @xmath0 and @xmath3 , owing to the spatial reciprocity @xcite .",
    "when @xmath26 is quite large , the persistent cooperators disappear and leave a much narrower region for the defectors than the space in fig .",

    "when @xmath26 increases and exceeds the critical value , the frequency of @xmath0 falls down to 0 as sharply as depicted in fig .",
    "it follows that if @xmath26 is larger than the threshold , the @xmath0-players have the fate to be driven out in the competition sooner or later for any @xmath147 .",
    "mankind which engages in various complex games of cooperation and defection achieves highest forms of cooperation among all life forms on the earth @xcite .",
    "many mechanisms were proposed to discover the mystery why natural selection is in favor of cooperative behavior , including the new model proposed by liu and guo @xcite , in which the total resulted payoff is shared in a different way from the normal pgg , that is , only a proportion of the total profit is shared by all the players irrelevant to their individual contribution .",
    "they introduced a new strategy named persistent cooperation in well - mixed populations .",
    "a persistent cooperator is a contributor who is willing to pay a second cost to retrieve the remaining portion of the payoff contributed by themselves .    in this paper",
    ", we focused on investigating the impact of persistent cooperating on the evolution of cooperation in spatial public goods games .",
    "the evolutionary dynamics of the structured populations consisting of three types of competing players ( pure cooperators , defectors and persistent cooperators ) are revealed by theoretical analysis and numerical simulations . in particular",
    ", we derive the approximate expressions of fixation probabilities for strategies on one - dimensional lattice . by using one - dimensional lattice and square lattice as the basic interacting network ,",
    "the spatial patterns of cooperation are discussed by means of the phase diagrams of stationary states of strategies depending on different combinations of distribution fraction of the total payoff and the second cost degree .",
    "the results reveal many relevant differences compared with the conclusions derived in well - mixed populations . such as , the coexistence of @xmath3 and @xmath0 never appears in well - mixed populations but comes up in lattice - structured populations .",
    "the evolutionary time for @xmath0 to reach the equilibrium state in lattice - structured populations is much shorter than that in well - mixed populations .",
    "furthermore , the ranges of parameters for @xmath0 dominating the whole lattice - structured populations are larger than that for well - mixed populations . our results also show that persistent cooperation promotes the evolution of cooperation for low synergic factor @xmath27 effectively , though defection takes over a considerably large territory in full phase diagram of @xmath26 versus @xmath24 . for relative high synergic factor",
    ", cooperators can survive attribute to network reciprocity .",
    "in addition , comparing the fixation probability of a @xmath0-mutant with that of a @xmath3-mutant on one - dimensional lattice provides further understanding for persistent cooperation in structured populations .",
    "for example , in some rigorous situations the difficulty in invasion and fixation of cooperation in a population consisting of non - cooperating individuals in well - mixed populations can be solved in the lattice - structured populations .",
    "it is also interesting to compare the persistent cooperation model studied here with punishment models that were introduced in the context of pggs to eliminate free riding ( defection ) and falilitate cooperation @xcite .",
    "whether cooperation is facilitated , however may depend  besides network structure @xcite  on parameters like the degree of rationality @xcite , and , in general , on the implementation of punishment in the game .",
    "punishment can be introduced in different forms , namely pool punishment @xcite and peer punishment @xcite . in comparison between punishing cooperators and punishing defectors helbing et al .",
    "@xcite showed that a fixed and finite interacting neighborhood can resolve the dilemma of second - order free - riding by separating punishing cooperators form pure cooperators . letting pool and peer punishment",
    "compete in the game , szolnoki at al",
    ".  showed that peer punishers outperform the pool punishers and control the system in large segments of parameters @xcite .",
    "punishment mechanisms may also be applied to human behavior in monetary systems : recently , wang et al .",
    "studied a model of tax system as an approach of punishment @xcite .",
    "overall , all punishment strategies in the previous models are costly .",
    "however , the purpose of persistent cooperators in our model is not only punishing defectors but also retrieving their deserved payoff . one main difference between our model and the previous ones",
    "is that the payoff of @xmath0-strategy is not always less than the pure cooperators .",
    "i.e. the benefit of @xmath0-players is larger than that of cooperators if @xmath148 . by this way",
    ", second - order free - riding problem can be avoided in appropriate range of @xmath26 and @xmath24 for certain @xmath27 without incurring personal benefit .    in conclusion , new interesting phenomena occur in a dynamics where agents play the pgg with persistent cooperation in lattice - structured populations .",
    "the existence of persistent cooperators greatly suppresses the spreading of defectors under more relaxed conditions in structured populations than that in well - mixed population .",
    "furthermore , our results are consistent not only with the conclusion that the population structures facilitate the evolution of cooperation in most situations , but also the common social experience that the higher the fraction in sharing the total benefit equally the less active humans are in cooperating .",
