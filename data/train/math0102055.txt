    "so let us consider the variety @xmath205 obtained by flopping in the @xmath187 face , so that @xmath206 is effective on @xmath205 .",
    "the nef cone can be found easily in this case :    [ thm : pyr ] an affine slice of @xmath207 is the span of the five divisors @xmath208 where @xmath209 . it is a square pyramid , the base being the face at which it meets @xmath179 ( see figure  [ fig : pyramid ] ) .",

    "we are now considering the lower triangular faces of the cuboctohedron of figure  [ fig : cuboctof ] . taking any one of the edges of the flopping face , the description of the movable fan inside the cuboctohedron centred on that edge",
    "tells us that half the boundary of the pyramid coincides with part of the boundary of @xmath207 ; these four descriptions put together give the whole of the boundary of the pyramid , so the nef cone must be the pyramid described .",
    "the automorphism group must fix the only square face of the pyramid , so @xmath211 consists exactly of those elements of @xmath204 that fix the flopping face .",

    "we can see that the cone just described must fit into the top square face of this cuboctohedron , since the bottom face is occupied by a model @xmath212 , and the top face is the only other face fixed by an automorphism of the movable fan of order @xmath0 .    although there are two @xmath211-orbits of triangular faces of this pyramid , the whole situation is symmetric ( the two are swapped by changing our arbitrary choice of @xmath213 and @xmath214 at the beginning of section  [ sec : smallresolutions ] ) , so we only need to analyse one of the flops .",
    "let us consider @xmath215 , obtained by flopping @xmath47 in the planes defined by @xmath187 and @xmath216 .",
    "[ thm : loz ] an affine slice of @xmath217 is the span of the eight divisors @xmath218 we will call this shape a _ lozengoid _ ( see figure  [ fig : lozengoid ] ) .",

    "we are now looking at the left - hand - side square face of the cuboctohedron in figure  [ fig : cuboctof ] .",
    "this immediately gives five vertices : @xmath86 , @xmath154 , @xmath220 , @xmath170 , and @xmath221 .",
    "the cone also fits into a side square face of the equivalent cuboctohedron centred at @xmath170 , since @xmath215 is also a resolution of @xmath170 ; there is a symmetry that interchanges @xmath86 and @xmath170 , which must also swap @xmath154 and @xmath220 , and this determines its effect completely ; it takes @xmath221 to @xmath222 .",
    "now , looking from the point of view of the vertex @xmath154 , the pyramidal cone of @xmath205 , as discussed above , fits into the top square face of the cuboctohedron , so @xmath215 , one flop away , fits into an upper triangular face .",
    "similarly , the pyramid that sits in the top face of @xmath86 s cuboctohedron is in a lower triangular face from the point of view of @xmath221 , and @xmath215 , two flops away , must again be in an upper triangular face .",
    "symmetry shows that the same holds for @xmath220 and @xmath222 .",
    "this means that we must have a symmetry of the given slice of @xmath217 any of these to any other , which forces the cone to be the shape described .",
    "since this involves the upper triangular faces of the cuboctohedron , it completes the job of describing cones that meet @xmath86that is , nef cones of resolutions of @xmath35 .",
    "but now every face of any of these cones borders another cone of one of these three types , so we have in fact described every cone in the fan :    the minimal models of general hm quintics fall into three families , the families of @xmath47 , @xmath205 , and @xmath215 , that we will call , after their nef cones , _ tiling type _ , _ pyramid type _ and _ lozengoid type _ respectively .",
    "all the models satisfy morrison s nef cone conjecture @xcite ; that is , the action of the biregular automorphism group of each variety on its nef cone has a rational polyhedral fundamental domain .",
    "any given hm quintic @xmath35 has infinitely many marked minimal models in each family , but up to isomorphism has only two minimal models of tiling type , two of pyramid type , and four of lozengoid type .",
    "theorems [ thm : tile ] , [ thm : pyr ] , and  [ thm : loz ] construct the three types of cone , and the construction describes what is on the other side of any face of any of these cones  there are square faces where tilings meet pyramids , triangular faces where pyramids meet lozengoids and quadrilateral faces where lozengoids meet other lozengoids , twisted by a quarter - turn .",
    "( this is hard to visualize , since these faces are not square on the picture ( figure  [ fig : lozengoid ] ) , but of course these are _ affine _ pictures and we have chosen different affine slice for the different models . ) every minimal model must be a finite sequence of flops away from @xmath47 , so we have described all minimal models .",
    "the nef cone conjecture is clear , and a fundamental domain is easily seen from the descriptions in the three cases .    for the last statement ,",
    "the two models of tiling type are the resolutions of @xmath35 and @xmath137 , those of pyramid type are one flop from each of these ( all such flops being isomorphic because @xmath223 acts transitively on the faces of @xmath179 ) ; lozengoid - type models come from flopping two adjacent faces of @xmath179 , which can be chosen in two ways because of the lack of automorphisms that act as order-@xmath26 rotations on the nef cone of @xmath47 .",
    "from the theorems of the last two sections we can deduce a complete combinatorial description of the movable fan of @xmath35 , since they give the shapes of the cones and the way the cones fit together at each ray . in this section we aim to give an understanding of the combinatorics of the movable fan as a polyhedral complex , disregarding the linear structure , and of the action on that complex of the birational automorphism group .",
    "so we will allow ourselves to squash and fold the cones .",
    "we will talk in terms of affine slices , making it a problem about @xmath96-dimensional solids .",
    "the first thing we can do to simplify matters is to glue the pyramids to the faces of the tilings .",
    "the result is a solid , no longer convex , with twice the vertices of the old square tiling , arranged like a square tiling again ( at @xmath224 to the old one ) , but with half the vertices protruding and with a diagonal inward fold ( marked by dotted lines in figure  [ fig : tandp ] ) across each face .",
    "a stellation of a square tiling . ]",
    "this reduces the problem to two sorts of solid , these stellated tilings and the lozengoids . now",
    "the lozengoid of figure  [ fig : lozengoid ] can be regarded as a cube distorted in such a way that two opposite faces ( the top and bottom faces in figure  [ fig : lozengoid ] ) become folded outwards along their diagonals ( see figure  [ fig : lozascube ] ) .",
    "a lozengoid . ]",
    "the way these cones are put together sets the dotted ridges on the lozengoids into the dotted furrows on the tilings , so we can flatten these folds to obtain a complex of ordinary cubes and square - tiled paraboloids .",
    "consider what has happened to the vertex figure ( figure  [ fig : cuboctof ] ) in this process : gluing the pyramids to the tilings has the effect of deleting the four edges around the bottom face of the cuboctohedron , leaving four downward - pointing spikes , which are flattened out when the dotted edges on the solids are flattened .",
    "the result is a square antiprism ( figure  [ fig : antiprism ] ) .",
    "a square tiling pokes into the each of the two square faces and a cube pokes into each triangular face .",
    "it is easily seen that this vertex configuration determines a unique simply connected polyhedral complex , because there is no choice about how the figures at two adjacent vertices are oriented with respect to one another .",
    "but we can construct such a simply - connected polyhedral complex with this configuration at every vertex as a _ uniform hyperbolic tiling _ ( see @xcite , @xcite ) as follows :    the coxeter graph @xmath225 describes a hyperbolic reflection group @xmath226 with a tetrahedral fundamental cell : the nodes of the graph correspond to the faces of the cell , and the angle between two faces is @xmath227 if the two nodes are joined by a double line , and @xmath228 if the two nodes are not joined . the marked graph @xmath229 represents a hyperbolic tiling with @xmath226 acting transitively on its vertices : the unique vertex of the tiling that is in the fundamental cell lies on the faces of the cell corresponding to unfilled nodes in the marked graph , and not on the faces corresponding to filled nodes .",
    "@xmath226-orbits of @xmath230-dimensional faces of the tiling are described by @xmath230-node subgraphs of @xmath229 having at least one marked node in each connected component ( for example , deleting an end node gives @xmath231 , a square tiling , and deleting a middle node gives @xmath232 , a square prism ) , so it is possible to work out the vertex configuration of this tiling : it is the same square antiprism as produced above .",
    "therefore we can identify the birational automorphism group of @xmath35 :    @xmath233 is isomorphic to a subgroup of index @xmath234 in the coxeter group whose graph is @xmath225 .",
    "recall from corollary  [ cor : trivialautos ] that @xmath161 is the group of birational automorphisms that act trivially on @xmath152 : therefore @xmath233 is the group of all symmetries of the movable fan arising from birational automorphisms .",
    "the construction above identifies the group of all symmetries of the fan with a subgroup of finite index in the group of symmetries of the uniform tiling @xmath235 given by @xmath225 , which is larger than the coxeter group @xmath226 because the graph has a non - trivial automorphism .",
    "but this graph automorphism exchanges the two @xmath226-orbits of square tiling cells in @xmath235 , and the construction above identifies these two orbits with the class of marked models isomorphic to @xmath47 and the class of marked models isomorphic to @xmath236 , so birational automorphisms do not swap them over",
    ". therefore @xmath233 is isomorphic to a subgroup of @xmath226 .",
    "in fact , the subgroup in question is of index @xmath234 in @xmath226a factor of @xmath0 comes from the fact that the creased face diagonals must be preserved ( alternatively , because the two classes of vertices corresponding to @xmath35 and @xmath137 must be preserved ) and a further factor of @xmath26 because there are no automorphisms of @xmath47 that induce rotations of order @xmath26 or reflections .",
    "the aim of this section is to demonstrate that , although by the results of the last section the movable fan of @xmath35 is combinatorially similar to a tiling of hyperbolic @xmath96-space , the cone @xmath237 itself is more subtle , by proving this theorem :    [ thm : notc2 ] the boundary of the cone @xmath237 is not twice differentiable at any point in @xmath238 .",
    "the description of the nef cones in sections [ sec : tile ] and  [ sec : rest ] allows us to find all the effective divisors on the boundary of the movable cone , since every such divisor is nef on some model .",
    "but the only rays in any of the nef cones described above that are in the boundary of @xmath237 are those corresponding to abelian fibrations on tiling type models .",
    "these rays must then be dense on the boundary , and we can investigate the shape of the boundary through them .",
    "so let us see how we can produce examples of these points .    from @xmath47",
    "we can flop the four classes of curves @xmath239 to get a pyramid type model ( the top of the cuboctohedron ) , from which we can flop one more class , say @xmath240 , to get a model @xmath241 .",
    "we know that @xmath242 for @xmath243 , and @xmath244 , which determine @xmath240 ; it can easily be checked that @xmath245 .",
    "let @xmath246 be the class of an abelian fibre on @xmath247 , and @xmath248 be the class of a line in a singular fibre of the abelian fibration given by @xmath246 .",
    "recall that in corollary  [ cor : cubic ] we defined an @xmath204-invariant quadratic form @xmath196 by @xmath195 , in the basis  ( [ eq : basis ] ) .",
    "let @xmath249 be the @xmath250-invariant quadratic form defined in the same way with reference to @xmath247 .",
    "to get from @xmath47 to this model we have the flopped the curves in each of the five classes @xmath239 , and @xmath240 , so we know @xmath251 , which determines @xmath246 exactly : @xmath252    we can also do this process in reverse , flopping a face of @xmath179 , say that given by @xmath253 , and four more faces to get a model @xmath254 . then @xmath47 bears the relation to @xmath255 that @xmath247 bears to @xmath47 , so @xmath256 ; that is , @xmath257    therefore we have @xmath258 so @xmath259    this is enough to prove theorem  [ thm : notc2 ] :    these two points @xmath246 and @xmath260 can be moved by the automorphisms of @xmath47 to get infinitely many points on the boundary of @xmath237 , accumulating at @xmath142 . the equations ( [ eq : a ] ) and ( [ eq : a  ] ) are preserved by the automorphisms of @xmath47 , so there are points accumulating at @xmath142 on two _ different _ quadric cones tangent at @xmath142 .",
    "these two sets of points constrain the second derivative , if it were defined , to take two different values , so it can not be defined .",
    "the two processes for obtaining new boundary rays from old can be iterated ; the plots in figure  [ fig : dotplot ] are of two different orthogonal projections of and affine slice of some such rays , showing the subtle shape of the boundary .",
    "finally , we can check explicitly that @xmath35 satisfies morrison s movable cone conjecture @xcite :      first consider the hyperbolic uniform tiling constructed in section  [ sec : comb ] by distorting the movable fan of @xmath35 .",
    "the standard fundamental domain for the action of the reflection group on this tiling is a tetrahedron with a vertex at the centre of one cell in each orbit  the centres of two cubes and two square - tiled paraboloids ( where the ` centre ' of a paraboloid is the unique point it contains that is in the boundary of hyperbolic @xmath96-space ) .",
    "the thick - line triangles on figure  [ fig : funddom ] show how eight such fundamental domains can be combined into a single fundamental domain for the action of @xmath261 .",
    "* @xmath262 , the centre of the paraboloid drawn ( in this view , the point at infinity vertically downwards ) , * @xmath263 , @xmath264 , @xmath265 , and @xmath266 , the centres of the square - tiled paraboloids meeting the one drawn at the points @xmath267 , @xmath268 , @xmath269 , and @xmath270 , * @xmath271 and @xmath272 , the centres of the cubes meeting the paraboloid drawn at @xmath273 and @xmath274 .",
    "now consider the movable fan of @xmath35 .",
    "for each of the points @xmath282 , the centre of a square - tiled paraboloid or a cube , let @xmath283 be a generator of the central ray of the corresponding square - tiled paraboloid or lozengoid in the movable fan , all chosen in the same affine slice @xmath284 .",
    "it is clear from symmetry that the three quadrilaterals @xmath285 , @xmath286 , and @xmath287 are planar , and the triangles @xmath288 ,",
    "@xmath289 , @xmath290 , and @xmath291 are certainly planar , so there is a ( possibly non - convex ) polyhedron with these seven faces .    the cone on this polyhedron will be a rational polyhedral fundamental domain for the action of @xmath261 on @xmath237 as long as it is convex .",
    "examination of the shape of the polyhedron shows that it will be convex as long as the three quadrilaterals are convex and the line @xmath292 passes through the interior of @xmath293 .",
    "we will therefore check these facts .",
    "choosing the right copy of the fundamental domain , we have , for some positive scalars @xmath294 , the following expressions ( the expression for @xmath295 is the sum of the vertices of the lozengoid described in theorem  [ fig : lozengoid ] ; @xmath246 was described in section  [ sec : boundary ] , and the remainder follow by translating these two by appropriate symmetries of @xmath179 ) @xmath296 @xmath297"
