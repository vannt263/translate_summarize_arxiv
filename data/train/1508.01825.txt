    "according to recent observational evidence , the universe is spatially flat and is currently undergoing an accelerated expansion phase @xcite . the simplest physical explanation for this result would be the existence of a cosmological constant driving the current acceleration of the universe , but there is a huge difference between the observed value of the cosmological constant and the vacuum energy density derived by quantum field theories ( the `` cosmological constant problem '' ) .",
    "another problem with the cosmological constant model is the `` coincidence problem '' : why should the accelerated expansion occur exactly now in the history of the universe ?",
    "these two problems have motivated many different cosmological models , ranging from scalar field models of dark energy to coupled dark energy models and modified gravity alternatives @xcite .",
    "so many different models , based on different physical assumptions , must be constrained by observations .",
    "usual tests include observational constraints from type ia supernova data , cosmic microwave background radiation and baryon oscillations .",
    "however , the comparison between different models should be done carefully , otherwise the results could be model- or calibration - dependent @xcite .",
    "an effective cosmological `` constant '' can be derived from dynamical dark energy models , its value varying slowly over cosmological timescales . for physical processes happening at shorter timescales",
    ", this variation will be negligible .",
    "we study here how the quasinormal modes of gravitational perturbations of a schwarzschild - de sitter ( sds ) black hole will be affected by a variable effective cosmological constant @xmath2 as a function of the redshift @xmath5 .",
    "the quasinormal mode frequencies will be a function only on the parameters of the spacetime @xcite . in the timescale for quasinormal mode oscillations",
    ", @xmath2 will be essentially a constant , but black holes at different redshifts will have different quasinormal mode frequencies .    in section [ sec : models ] we present four different cosmological models and numerical results for each @xmath0 .",
    "the variation of the sds quasinormal modes as a function of @xmath2 is shown in section [ sec : qnms ] . in section [ sec : cosmo ] we propose a cosmological application of our results , calculate the resulting frequency shift for supermassive black holes and discuss the detectability of this effect .",
    "finally , we give our final remarks in section [ sec : final ] .",
    "we consider here four different cosmological models ( models a - d ) , that have different underlying physical assumptions . from each one we can derive equations that describe the cosmological constant as a function of the redshift .",
    "we present numerical results for each model in fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda_z ] . for all models we keep @xmath6 , which we consider as an upper bound for black hole formation @xcite .",
    "we do not intend for this section to be a comprehensive review on these models , so we will point the reader to the original papers in each subsection for more details .      in @xcite ,",
    "a model is proposed following some simple assumptions on quantum cosmology and a dimensional analysis . in this scenario ,",
    "the effective cosmological constant is a function of the scale factor @xmath7 as @xmath8 or , as an explicit function of the cosmological redshift @xmath5 , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the present value of the cosmological constant .",
    "this would lead to an early universe value of @xmath2 several orders of magnitude larger than the present @xmath10 , which is a useful feature in light of the cosmological constant problem .",
    "this model is presented as `` model a '' in fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda_z ] .",
    "the coupled quintessence model proposed in @xcite has a light scalar field @xmath11 ( the quintessence ) with an exponential potential @xmath12 , linearly coupled to the ordinary matter , that is responsible for the cosmic acceleration as a dynamical cosmological constant .",
    "this model is written in terms of the variables @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the hubble parameter and @xmath15 is the radiation density . by using the variables @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , the klein - gordon equation for the scalar field and the friedman equation for the spacetime can be re - written as the following system @xmath19 where the independent variable is @xmath20 , the prime denotes @xmath21 and @xmath22 is a dimensionless constant given by @xmath23 ( @xmath24 is the coupling constant between the scalar field and the ordinary matter ) .",
    "we remark here that the parameters @xmath22 and @xmath25 ( related to the scalar field potential ) are all that is needed to completely specify the model",
    ". however , the numerical solution found is strongly dependent on the initial values supplied for ( [ eq : x1x2x3 ] ) .",
    "the initial values ( at early times ) required for cosmic solutions are near @xmath26 and the exact values used here were found by trial and error , until we approached the standard @xmath2cdm values for the present cosmological constant density parameter , @xmath27 , and for the present matter density parameter , @xmath28 . with these values , the model makes the transition from a radiation dominated universe , at early times , to a matter dominated universe until close to the present time , when we have a @xmath2-dominated stage .    with the numerical solution of the system ( [ eq : x1x2x3 ] ) ,",
    "we can then obtain the scalar field density parameter @xmath29 as a function of @xmath30 , @xmath31 where @xmath32 and the critical density @xmath33 can be written as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the present radiation density .",
    "therefore , we can explicitly write @xmath36 with @xmath37 and the @xmath38 are the present values of the @xmath39 at @xmath40 .",
    "this model is presented as `` model b '' in fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda_z ] .    since there is no analytical solution for @xmath0 in eq .",
    ", we performed a 4th order polynomial fit for the numerical results , @xmath41 with the coefficients given in the left side of table  [ table : lambda_fit ] .      in @xcite , a holographic dark energy model with an interaction between dark energy and dark matter",
    "is studied .",
    "the future event horizon is chosen as the infrared cutoff , providing a time - dependent ratio of the matter energy density and the dark energy density .",
    "this model also allows the transition of the dark energy equation of state to phantom regimes , as proposed by @xcite .    for this model we can write from the friedman equation , @xmath42\\ , , \\\\",

    "lower plot : same as the upper plot , but for @xmath54.,title=\"fig : \" ]    combining the empirical fits ( [ eq : omega_fit ] ) with the solutions we obtained in section [ sec : models ] for @xmath0 , we can produce @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "these combined expressions show how the quasinormal mode frequencies would be affected by a variable cosmological constant : black holes at different redshifts will have different corrections from @xmath0 , that will depend on the particular cosmological model used .",
    "the necessary assumption implicit for this analysis is that the timescale for the evolution of @xmath2 is much longer than that of the black hole perturbations , which allows us to use the metric ( [ eq : sds ] ) with the variable @xmath0 .",
    "since the actual value of @xmath10 is so small , we will keep now only the terms up to first order in @xmath2 in the absolute frequency difference caused by the time dependence of the cosmological constant , that can be written as @xmath57 where @xmath58 .",
    "if we return now to physical units , we can assess exactly how small this effect is and the feasibility ( or not ) of using it as a real cosmological test .    for @xmath59 ,",
    "the frequency @xmath60 measured in hz is @xmath61 and restoring the physical dimensions to @xmath2 and @xmath62 gives    @xmath63    ( recall that @xmath64 is dimensionless ) .",
    "if we take now the current value of the cosmological constant as approximately @xmath65 , and @xmath66 from table  [ table : omega_fit ] , then we have @xmath67 and we can finally rewrite eq .   as @xmath68 which allows us to write the relative frequency shift @xmath69 equations ( [ eq : delta_f ] ) and ( [ eq : delta_f / f ] ) confirm the intuition that the effect of the cosmological constant on the quasinormal modes should be very small , but they go beyond this intuition and quantify the effect .. the resulting very small variation in @xmath70 shows that the mode amplitude ratios will be almost identically the same as in the constant @xmath2 case . ]",
    "we can see that it becomes larger at larger masses , but even in a case with a @xmath71 black hole and an enhancement factor of 100 from the evolution of @xmath2 there is no prospect of measuring @xmath72 . in this case",
    ", we would have the relative frequency shift @xmath73 .",
    "we have presented here a comparison between four different cosmological models with variable cosmological constant .",
    "we presented analytical solutions for @xmath0 when possible , in the case of models a and d ( this result is new and was not presented in @xcite ) and numerical solutions with corresponding polynomial fits for models b and c , which are also novel results not provided in references @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our results show that all four models considered here can be distinguished from each other by their predicted evolutions , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda_z ] . even for models",
    "c and d , which show the closest behavior , this difference amounts to @xmath74 at @xmath75 . for the other models",
    ", the difference can be as large as a factor @xmath76 at the same redshift .",
    "we also studied the influence of the variable cosmological constant in the quasinormal modes of gravitational perturbations in a schwarzschild - de sitter black hole , and presented a numerical fit for @xmath1 .",
    "an increase in the value of @xmath2 will decrease both @xmath77 ( and increase the oscillation period ) and @xmath78 ( and increase the damping time of the perturbation ) .",
    "the resulting effect in the quasinormal mode frequencies is extremely small .",
    "we quantified this effect and calculated it for a supermassive black hole as a cosmological application of our results .",
    "however , the detectability of the effect of the evolution of the cosmological constant in black hole quasinormal modes is very far from the current status of any gravitational wave detectors .",
