    "the kaon - nucleon ( @xmath4 ) scattering processes have aroused particular interest in the past @xcite and many works have been devoted to this issue based on the constituent quark model .",
    "but up to now , most of them can not accurately reproduce the @xmath4 phase shifts up to the orbit angular momentum @xmath7 in a sufficient consistent way . in this work",
    "we perform a resonating group method ( rgm ) calculation of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 wave @xmath4 phase shifts of isospin @xmath8 and @xmath9 in the chiral su(3 ) quark model , which has been successful in reproducing the energies of the baryon ground states , the binding energy of deuteron , the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath10 ) scattering phase shifts , and the hyperon - nucleon ( @xmath11 ) cross sections by the rgm calculations @xcite .",
    "the model is extended to include an antiquark @xmath12 and the mixing of @xmath13 and @xmath14 is considered .",
    "a satisfactory description of the @xmath4 phase shifts for different partial waves is obtained except for the cases of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , of which the calculated phase shifts are too repulsive and a little bit too attractive respectively when the laboratory momentum of the kaon meson is greater than 400 mev in this present investigation .",
    "in the chiral su(3 ) quark model , the potential between the @xmath15th and @xmath16th constituent quarks can be written as @xmath17 where the confinement potential @xmath18 describes the long - range nonperturbative qcd effect and the one - gluon - exchange potential @xmath19 depicts the short - range perturbative qcd effect .",
    "the chiral - field - induced quark - quark potential is in the form of @xmath20 and mainly signifies the medium - range nonperturbative qcd effect . in this expressions ,",
    "@xmath21 are the scalar nonet fields , and @xmath22 the pseudoscalar nonet fields . in order to study the @xmath4 system ,",
    "we extend our model to include an antiquark @xmath12 .",
    "the interaction between @xmath23 and @xmath12 includes two parts : direct interaction and annihilation parts , @xmath24 where @xmath25 @xmath26 now , the total hamiltonian of @xmath4 system is written as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the kinetic energy operator of the center of mass motion , and the explicit expressions of the potentials can be found in the literature @xcite .    in our calculation",
    ", the mixing of @xmath13 and @xmath14 is considered , and the mixing angle @xmath29 is taken to be two possible values .",
    "one is @xmath30 ( ideal mixing ) and the other is @xmath31 ( provided by dai _ et al . _",
    "the model parameters are fixed by some special constraints @xcite and their values are tabulated in table 1 .",
    "a rgm dynamical calculation is made to study the @xmath4 scattering process , and the calculated phase shifts are shown in figs .",
    "[ s0s1 ] and [ pdf ] .",
    "experimental values are taken from the analysis of hyslop _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and hashimoto @xcite .",
    "-1.6 cm    -1.4 cm    for the @xmath0-wave we obtain the correct sign of the @xmath32 channel phase shifts comparing with the recent rgm calculation in which @xmath33 and @xmath34 boson exchanges are considered @xcite , and our results are in agreement with the experimental data for both isospin @xmath8 and @xmath9 channels , though for @xmath35 they are a little repulsive . for the higher angular momentum results , comparing with the study of lemaire _",
    "@xcite , we now get correct signs of @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 waves , and a considerable improvement on the theoretical phase shifts in the magnitude for @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath6 channels .",
    "we also compare our results with those of the previous work of black @xcite .",
    "although our calculation achieves a considerable improvement for all partial waves , the results of @xmath5 wave are too repulsive in both black s work and our present one .",
    "maybe the effects of the coupling to the inelastic channels and hidden color channels should be considered in future work .    from figs . 1 and 2 one can see the results are very similar for the cases of @xmath44 and @xmath45 . it is comprehensible because in both of these two cases the attraction of @xmath33 is reduced , just in different approaches . when @xmath44 the interaction between @xmath23 and @xmath46 quarks vanishes , while @xmath45 the attraction of @xmath33 between @xmath47 and @xmath48 quarks is strongly reduced .",
    "the @xmath4 scattering process is studied in the chiral su(3 ) quark model , which has been extended to include an antiquark , by solving a rgm equation .",
    "the numerical results of different partial waves are in agreement with the experimental data except for the cases of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , which are less well described when the laboratory momentum of the kaon meson is greater than 400 mev in the present investigation .",
    "it turns out that our model is successful to be extended to study the @xmath4 system , and some useful information of the quark - quark and quark - antiquark interactions are obtained from this study .",
