    "<S> this is also confirmed for the dark energy models @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , this argument is partly correct because one also needs to investigate the error on the power spectrum induced from eds assumption ( _ i.e. _ the value of the linear growth rate is equal to that of the square root of the matter energy density contrast , @xmath11 ) . </S>",

    "<S> all the kernels of the higher order power spectrum terms must be expressed as a product of kernels that correspond to full mode coupling terms and full propagator terms in order to make the resummation possible . </S>",

    "<S> we find that @xmath15 using eds assumption causes 6 @xmath16 11 % errors for @xmath17 mode at @xmath18 and these induce errors on @xmath3 about 11 @xmath16 20 % .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to spt , the lagrangian perturbation theory ( lpt ) is an another widely used analytic technique for the quasi - linear perturbative expansion . </S>",
