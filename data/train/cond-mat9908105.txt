    "ultrafast nonlinear spectroscopy provides unique and powerful tools for studying the dynamics of coulomb correlation effects in semiconductors , since the time resolution can now be much smaller than the scattering times of the elementary excitations and , e.g , the period of optical phonons or plasmons . during the past decade , femtosecond pump  probe and wave  mixing experiments have demonstrated that in these materials both coherent and dissipative processes are governed by many ",
    "body effects.@xcite parallel theoretical advances have accounted for the two  particle correlation effects in undoped semiconductors through the time dependent hartree ",
    "fock approximation ( hfa ) , which has developed into the very successful semiconductor bloch equations ( sbe s ) formalism.@xcite however , more recent experimental observations could not be explained within this mean field approach and were attributed to four  particle and higher order coulomb correlation effects.@xcite these high order correlation effects have been mostly studied with equation  of  motion methods for density matrices @xcite or pair  operators@xcite and by using the keldysh green s function formalism.@xcite    at the same time , much less is known about the role of _ coherent _ many  body effects in the nonlinear optical response of doped semiconductors and , in particular , modulation  doped heterostructures . some aspects of the effects of the electron  electron ( _ e  e _ ) scattering have been described within the dephasing and relaxation time approximations without microscopic justification .",
    "most importantly however , the role of the time ",
    "dependent electron  hole ( _ e  h _ ) correlations between the photoexcited holes and the fermi sea ( fs ) electrons on the ultrafast dynamics is still poorly understood .",
    "the main difficulty comes from the non  perturbative nature of the fermi edge singularity ( fes ) which dominates the absorption spectrum close to the absorption onset , and which can not be described within the above approximations.@xcite important here is that the _ e  h _ interactions between a heavy photoexcited hole and the fs - electrons lead to the scattering of a macroscopic number of low  energy fs - pairs , which readjusts the entire fs into a new orthogonal scattering state in the course of the optical excitation ( anderson orthogonality catastrophe@xcite ) .",
    "the fes is a many  body resonance that has been observed both in doped semiconductors and in metals.@xcite its non  lorentzian lineshape can be viewed as originating from the decay of an excitonic bound state caused by its interactions with the gapless fs excitations.@xcite in a first approximation , the excitonic effects in a doped semiconductor can be described by extending the mean field approach ( hfa ) to include the effects of the screening and the pauli blocking due to the fs.@xcite however , such a static treatment of the fs leads to a spurious bound state with respect to the fermi energy , @xmath0 , referred to in the following as the hfa bound state.@xcite this discrete state , with binding energy @xmath1 , would appear at the energy @xmath2 . obviously , for @xmath3 ( as in typical modulation ",
    "doped quantum wells ) , such a state can not exist since it overlaps with the fs continuum , with which it interacts via the _ e  h _ potential.@xcite the `` unbinding '' of this hfa bound state occurs via its interactions with the fs excitations,@xcite which are _ not _ taken into account in the hfa .",
    "note that , in two  dimensional systems , a static fs allows for bound states even for arbitrarily small attractive interactions and therefore such an unbinding can not arise from static screening or from pauli blocking effects .",
    "this spurious bound state could be artificially merged with the continuum by introducing a dephasing time comparable to its binding energy .",
    "such an approximation , however , neglects competely the interactions between the photoexcited _ e  h _ pair and the fs excitations .",
    "a microscopic description of the unbinding of the hfa bound state presents a nontrivial problem due to the non  perturbative nature of the _ e  h _ correlations between the photoexcited hole and the fs excitations.@xcite even within green function techniques , this problem is rather involved because vertex correction diagrams with arbitrarily many crossed _",
    "interaction lines are as divergent as the ladder diagrams and should be treated on equal footing.@xcite to perform such a task , one must sum up at least the parquet diagrams and address the three  body correlations between the photoexcited hole and a fs excitation.@xcite therefore , alternative methods were developed for the case of linear absorption , based on fermi s golden rule with many ",
    "electron eigenstates expressed in terms of slater determinants.@xcite such approaches become exact in the limit @xmath4 ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the electron and hole masses respectively ) and describe quite accurately the fes lineshapes observed in typical modulation  doped quantum wells.@xcite    another approach to the fes problem is based on the coupled cluster expansion ( cce).@xcite this general many  body technique provided exact results in the limit @xmath4 @xcite and was used to treat the hole recoil correlations in one dimension.@xcite in the latter case , an exact solution was obtained for @xmath7 .",
    "the cce has also been used to describe the _ e  e _ correlation effects @xcite .",
    "more importantly , however , this method is well  suited for describing correlations in non  equilibrium systems , where it retains the advantages of diagrammatic expansions without resorting to the kadanoff - baym ansatz or to the markovian approximation.@xcite    let us now briefly summarize recent experimental studies of dephasing and relaxation processes in modulation  doped quantum wells .",
    "@xcite performed pump  probe measurements under resonant excitation conditions and observed an incoherent redshift of the fes at positive time delays due to the incoherent bandgap renormalization . at room temperature , knox _ et .",
    "@xcite measured very fast e  e scattering times estimated @xmath8 10 fs , which implies extremely fast dephasing and relaxation . at low temperatures , kim _ et al . _",
    "@xcite measured long dephasing times within the frequency range @xmath9 ( the frequency domain of the fes ) , consistent with measurements in metals @xcite .",
    "this result is consistent with the landau fermi liquid theory @xcite ( which applies both to metals and doped ",
    "quantum wells due to the similar values of @xmath10 ) and points out that , unlike for the _ e  h _ correlations , the _ e  e _ scattering is suppressed within the frequency range of the fes . furthermore , the above experiment suggests that the hole dephasing times are rather long .",
    "the above experimental results were interpreted within a two  level system approximation ( which neglects all fes correlation effects ) by introducing energy ",

    "energies.@xcite note here that , unlike in undoped semiconductors , the relaxation of _ real _ photo - excited _ e  h _ pairs due to their interactions with the fs electrons@xcite can obscure the role of the _ e  h _ correlations .",
    "however , these incoherent effects can be suppressed by tuning the pump frequency _ below _ the fes resonance and thus exciting only virtual carriers . in this case",
    ", coherent effects will dominate .",
    "al._@xcite performed such pump  probe measurements on doped qws with well  below  resonance pump excitation and observed qualitatively different nonlinear optical dynamics for the fes as compared to excitons in undoped qws .",
    "this suggests that the differences in the nature of the two resonances do manifest themselves in the transient changes of the optical properties .    in this paper",
    ", we develop a microscopic many  body theory for treating the coherent nonlinear optical response of the fes .",
    "in particular , we focus on the manifestations of the non  perturbative _ e  h _ correlations ( dynamical fs response ) on the ultrafast time evolution of the pump  probe spectrum . in order to describe the dynamical fs response",

    "pair interactions , analogous to the exciton ",
    "exciton interactions in undoped semiconductors , are screened out , while the _ e  e _ scattering is suppressed for below  resonant excitation as dictated by fermi liquid theory .",
    "instead , it is the _ e  h _ interactions between the photoexcited _ e  h _ pairs and the fs carriers that strongly affect the coherent ultrafast dynamics of the fes .",
    "an important difference from undoped semiconductors is that , due to its _ gapless _ pair excitation spectrum , a fs responds _ unadiabatically _ to time  dependent perturbations .",
    "in contrast , because of its finite coulomb binding energy , an exciton can be polarized by the pump optical field without being ionized .",
    "a non  equilibrium treatment beyond the hfa is necessary in order to take into account the unadiabatic time ",

    "we study in detail the qualitative differences in the ultrafast dynamics with and without ( hfa ) the dynamical fs response and point out the important role of the _ e  h _ correlations in the coherent regime .",
