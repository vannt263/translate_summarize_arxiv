    "however , one faces multiple difficulties @xcite : ( i ) the liquid - vapour interface in the vicinity of the contact line is strongly distorted . in a cap - shaped drop geometry , these effects are particularly pronounced because the tension of the three - phase contact line between solid , liquid and vapour deforms the droplet . to leading order ,",
    "the line tension , @xmath15 , gives rise to a dependence of the contact angle , @xmath2 , on the droplet radius , @xmath256 , which takes the form of gretz s equation @xcite @xmath257 ( ii ) the curvature of the liquid - vapour interface and the concomitant laplace pressure shift the liquid - vapour equilibrium from its bulk coexistence value .",
    "moreover , only in a certain range of system sizes equilibrium droplets of a specified radius , @xmath256 , can be observed .",
    "( iii ) microscopically , the contact angle is not well defined but it always involves an extrapolation of the position of the liquid - vapour interface towards the solid substrate . for small droplet sizes",
    "such an extrapolation imparts a significant error onto the estimates of the contact angle , @xmath2 .",

    "vapour density and liquid compressibility are small , and the shift of the pressure away from the bulk coexistence value does not give rise to a noticeable change of the liquid or vapour properties .",
    "the third caveat can be mitigated by avoiding to extract the contact line by the details of the liquid - vapour interface at the three - phase contact but rather fitting the shape of the entire drop to the macroscopic prediction .",

    "the free energy penalty of a surface deformation of molten brushes has been considered within the strong stretching approximation .",
    "these calculations typically consider an incompressible brush and a sharp brush - melt interface . under these conditions",
    "height fluctuations of the brush with long lateral wavelengths will be strongly suppressed because of the prohibitive costs of stretching of the lateral chain conformations @xcite . in our simulations",
    ", however , the polymer liquid exhibits a non - trivial equation of state with a finite compressibility .",
    "therefore , a deformation of the surface of the brush can result in density fluctuations and even a spatially homogeneous displacement of the brush - melt interface is possible @xcite .",
    "the deformability of the brush surface decreases with the grafting density , @xmath268 , because ( i ) the number of chains , which are stretched , increases and ( ii ) the density inside the brush increases and its compressibility decreases in turn .",

    "( ii ) a thick film will be metastable to fluctuations , and the dewetting process can be initiated on relevant time scale only by defects or a rupture of the film . the simulation data in figure [ fig_dewet ]",

    "unfortunately the simulation of dewetting phenomena poses a huge computational challenge because they require the study of large systems with more than @xmath323 beads over long times in order to observe the transition from slip - dominated to viscosity - dominated dewetting behaviour . using efficient simulation techniques such studies",

    "i.e._capillary waves , are difficult to distinguish from the shape of the rim predicted by analytical approaches without fluctuations . in particular , one would have to average the simulations over multiple realisations of the dewetting process in order to decide if the profile of the rim decays oscillatory towards the initial film thickness .",
    "molecular simulations can build a bridge between the microscopic flow behaviour of particle - based models and a continuum description . while those multi - scale techniques have matured for equilibrium properties @xcite ,",
    "the development of computational strategies that can describe the dynamics of polymer liquids across different scales is still in its infancy . on the one hand",

    "this list depends on the specific problem that one wants to describe .",

    "e.g. _ , one needs the interface potential , @xmath331 , which measures the free energy cost per unit area of placing the liquid - vapour interface a distance , @xmath332 , away from the solid substrate .",
    "the role of molecular simulations in this scope is two - fold : ( i ) measurement of these coarse - grained parameters for a specific microscopic model : such studies are practically useful because they predict the behaviour of liquids .",
    "an understanding of the molecular basis of the coarse - grained parameters will contribute to tailoring the properties of boundaries between solid and liquids .",

    "this question can be only answered for specific systems .    for",
    "the motion of liquid drops with a rather large slip length on a hard , corrugated substrate , our simulations suggest that the coarse - grained parameters , which we have listed above , yield an appropriate description of the microscopic physics because using the independently determined parameters in an approximate hydrodynamic description provides a quantitative description of the velocity profile inside the drop and its steady - state velocity @xcite . a detailed comparison with a numerically accurate solution of the hydrodynamic theory for the steady - state motion is certainly warranted to validate this result and to help extrapolating the results to larger , experimentally accessible drop sizes .    in the example of a brush - coated surface @xcite or a strongly attractive solid @xcite , our simulations suggest that the slip length , @xmath12 , and hydrodynamic position , @xmath308 , do not provide an appropriate description of the flow at the boundary .",
    "the simulations demonstrate that these two parameters are not able to simultaneously describe planar shear flow ( couette ) and parabolic , pressure - driven flow ( poiseuille ) .",
    "this failure of the navier slip condition can be `` reproduced '' by a schematic , two - layer model demonstrating that it is not related to a shear - rate dependence of the viscosity ( shear thinning ) or a time - dependent viscosity ( visco - elasticity ) .",
    "we speculate that it truly is a boundary effect and not related to bulk properties of the fluid ( _ e.g. _ , non - newtonian character of the polymer liquid ) .",
    "it is rather tempting to attribute this failure to higher - order spatial derivatives in the relation between viscous stress at the substrate and stress at the boundary .    since the question about the appropriate coarse - grained parameters for fluid flow at boundaries",
    "can only be answered for specific systems there is a rich and wide - open spectrum of systems and processes to be investigated . in this manuscript",
    "we have restricted our attention to the most basic , coarse - grained models of polymer liquids ( _ i.e. _ , a lennard - jones bead - spring model and a bead - spring model with soft potentials ) and the most basic flow phenomena ( couette and poiseuille flow , and the steady - state motion of droplets in response to a body force ) .",
    "of course , nano- and microfluidic systems offer a much greater variety of flow geometries ( _ e.g. _ , chemically or topologically structured surfaces ) , deal with more complicated fluids ( _ e.g. _ , viscoelastic liquids ) , and often require to consider additional phenomena ( _ e.g. _ , spreading of drops or mixing in multi - component liquids , evaporation effects ) .",
