    "observations of sbs1542 + 541 using the international ultraviolet explorer ( porter _ et al .",
    "_  unpublished ) show that there is significant continuum flux down to below @xmath19 , corresponding to @xmath20 in the rest frame .",
    "this made the object a good candidate for possibly observing ly@xmath10@xmath21304 absorption in the intergalactic medium with the hopkins ultraviolet telescope ( hut ) during the astro-2 mission .",
    "observations of hs1700 + 64 ( @xmath22 ) on the same mission successfully measured the opacity ( davidsen , kriss , & zheng 1996 ) .",
    "however , during the observations of sbs1542 + 541 on 1995 march 16 we discovered that there was a cutoff in flux slightly redshifted from the expected position of the ly@xmath10  absorption , causing us to suspect that the observed feature was a lyman limit from a low - redshift intervening absorber . to further investigate this possibility we performed observations on 1995 september 3 with the g130h , g190h , and g270h gratings of the hst fos .",
    "the presence of the intervening system is verified by a strong @xmath232796 , 2804 doublet in the g270h spectrum at the same redshift ( @xmath5 ) as the lyman edge visible in the hut spectrum .",
    "fortuitously , the fos spectra also reveal broad absorption lines from several very highly - ionized species , many of which have never before been observed in a broad absorption line qso .",
    "it is the study of this broad absorption system that is the focus of our present interest .",
    "roughly 10% of radio - quiet qsos exhibit broad ( @xmath24 @xmath25 ) blueshifted absorption features associated with the qso , known as broad absorption lines ( bals ) , with outflow velocities generally @xmath26 ( turnshek 1984 ) .",
    "these objects are collectively referred to as broad absorption line qsos , or balqsos .",
    "the absorption features most commonly observed are ly@xmath10   @xmath211216 , @xmath211549 , @xmath211397 , and @xmath211240 , though low - ionization lines , usually @xmath212798 and @xmath211857 , are observed in some objects , usually called low - ionization balqsos .",
    "higher - ionization lines are sometimes reported , up through @xmath21774 and @xmath21615 ( korista & arav 1997 ) .",
    "when studying a bal system , one of the primary goals is to determine column densities of the various observed ions , which are used in turn to derive the ionization state of the gas and its chemical composition . to determine column densities",
    ", it is necessary to measure the optical depth of the absorption as a function of outflow velocity . in deriving the optical depth from the relative depression of the continuum flux ,",
    "one typically makes the assumptions that ( 1 ) there are no unresolved narrow lines in the bal troughs , ( 2 ) scattered radiation does not fill in the absorption troughs , and ( 3 ) the bal gas completely and homogeneously covers the continuum source on the observed line of sight .",
    "if any of these assumptions are invalid , then the true column densities could be much greater than those inferred from the observations . based on high - resolution observations of bal troughs (",
    "barlow & junkkarinen 1994 ) , assumption ( 1 ) appears to be a good one .",
    "studies of bal geometry ( turnshek 1988 ; hamann , korista , & morris 1993 ) suggest that the global bal region covering factor , which is the fractional solid angle subtended by the bal gas as seen from the continuum source , is generally @xmath27 ( except possibly in low - ionization balqsos ; boroson & meyers 1992 ; turnshek _ et al . _",
    "1997 ) . if the global bal covering factor is small , and especially if the outflow velocities are large , then ( 2 ) should be adequately satisfied , although spectropolarimetry suggests that some scattered light is present in the depths of the bal troughs ( goodrich & miller 1995 ; cohen _ et al . _  1995 ) .",
    "however , there is evidence that assumption ( 3 ) is invalid : in some instances absorption doublets appear to show saturation of the components but not at zero intensity ( korista _ et al . _  1992",
    ") , implying that the absorbing gas only partially covers the source .",
    "more definite evidence for partial covering has been observed in the so - called associated or @xmath28 absorption lines ( hamann _ et al . _  1997 ; hamann , barlow , & junkkarinen 1997 ) , which are distinguished from bals primarily by being much narrower , usually having widths @xmath29 a few hundred @xmath25 .",
    "the fraction of the continuum source occulted by the bal region along the line of sight is called the covered fraction , or for clarity the _ continuum source covered fraction _ , to distinguish it from the global bal region covering factor . for the remainder of this paper",
    ", we will use the term _ covered fraction _ to refer to the continuum source covered fraction .",
    "we begin with a presentation of the observations used for this research (  [ sec : obs ] ) , followed by a discussion of the spectra and how we fit the bals in order to estimate minimum column densities and covered fractions of the absorbing ions (  [ sec : analysis ] ) .",
    "we then discuss some properties of the system that can be inferred in the context of a photoionization model , including constraints on the ionization state and column density and the resulting implications for the geometry and physical structure of the gas (  [ sec : discuss ] ) . finally we summarize the characteristics of this particular balqso that make it so interesting and potentially relevant to the study of balqsos as a whole (  [ sec : summary ] ) .",
    "our observations with the hst fos were performed on 1995 september 3 .",
    "they include 14880  s with the g130h grating , 5470  s with g190h , and 1600  s with g270h .",
    "these three spectra are shown in figure  [ fig : uvspec ] .",
    "the g130h data had to be corrected for a flickering diode not recognized by the fos pipeline at the time of processing .",
    "this diode ( # 22 affecting wavelengths @xmath30 ) was added to the list of dead diodes and the spectrum was reprocessed .",
    "these spectra have a resolution of 1   ( g130h ) , 1.44   ( g190h ) , and 2   ( g270h ) , corresponding to a range of velocity resolution of @xmath31 @xmath25  for the fos data .    at optical wavelengths we use two observations .",
    "the first was performed on 1995 april 1 with the mmt and covers @xmath32 with a resolution of 3.2  , corresponding to a velocity resolution @xmath33 @xmath25 . the other observation was performed on 1995 june 3 with the steward observatory 2.3 m telescope , including the wavelength range @xmath34 with a 5.54   resolution , corresponding to a velocity resolution of @xmath35 @xmath25 .",
    "the mmt spectrum is of excellent quality in the wavelength region below @xmath36 for a ground - based observation , which is fortunate since this reveals well the broad absorption feature centered at @xmath37 .",
    "the optical spectra are shown in figure  [ fig : optspec ] .",
    "together , these five spectra provide us with continuous wavelength coverage from @xmath2 to @xmath3 , or @xmath4 in the qso rest frame . for the purpose of identifying the @xmath5 intervening absorption system",
    ", we also refer to the hut spectrum of sbs1542 + 541 obtained on 1995 march 16 during the astro-2 mission , shown in figure  [ fig : hutspec ] . a normalized template created from blank - field spectra",
    "was used to remove airglow .",
    "this removes the broad wings of ly@xmath10 , but some narrow residuals remain for ly@xmath10  and a few other strong lines which were removed by hand .",
    "the spectrum is of low s / n due to the short integration time ( 4320 s ) , so we do not use it for the analysis of the bal system .",
    "we have also analyzed x - ray data from a @xmath38 exposure of sbs1542 + 541 obtained with the _ rosat _ position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) on 1993 august 14 .",
    "the observed count rate was @xmath39 .",
    "the s / n is too low to derive meaningful information about the spectral shape , so we use the data only to estimate the x - ray flux .",
    "this is discussed further in  [ sec : photoion ] .",
    "we corrected the spectra for galactic extinction based on a column density of neutral hydrogen along the line of sight of @xmath40 @xmath12   ( stark _ et al . _",
    "1992 ) . using a conversion of @xmath41 ( shull & van steenberg 1985 )",
    ", this corresponds to an extinction @xmath42 .",
    "we then performed the extinction correction using the formulation of cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) , assuming @xmath43 .    in order to estimate the errors in the optical data , we fit small bands of apparently featureless continuum in each spectrum . near the @xmath231548 , 1551 feature in the steward data , we fit the region @xmath44 .",
    "we find that the error per pixel is around @xmath45 @xmath46 , corresponding to a s / n per pixel of @xmath47 .",
    "we used this value to produce a constant error array that was used in the fit of . in the mmt spectrum ,",
    "we fit @xmath48 and found an error per pixel of @xmath49 @xmath46 , corresponding to a s / n per pixel of @xmath50 .",
    "again we simply produced a constant error array that was used in the fit of ly@xmath10 , @xmath231239 , 1243 , and @xmath231032 , 1038 .",
    "however , given that the observation includes short wavelengths so near the atmospheric limit , the s / n is lower at the shorter wavelengths .",
    "hence , we realize that this is probably an overestimate of the errors in the region of ly@xmath10  and and an underestimate of the errors near , but since there are no spectral regions near these lines that can be well fit to estimate the errors , we will use this constant value .",
    "many of the problems associated with studying bals are minimized in the spectrum of sbs1542 + 541 . due to the relatively small velocity width of the lines as well as the apparent lack of low - ionization species ,",
    "most of the interesting lines are not blended and therefore the continuum is generally well - defined in the vicinity of the broad absorption features .",
    "also , the line of sight to the object contains an unusual paucity of intervening lyman - limit absorption systems .",
    "we identify only three at @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath5 . in the next section",
    "we briefly discuss each narrow - line system .",
    "a more comprehensive study of the intervening narrow - line systems ( _ e.g. _  vogel & reimers 1995 ) would require data of higher s / n",
    ".      the @xmath51 system is clearly established by definite lyman - series lines through ly@xmath53 as well as lines from ly@xmath54 that appear to be blended with other narrow lines , presumably from the ly@xmath10  forest .",
    "in addition , there are strong lines corresponding to @xmath21977 and @xmath21903 along with possible lines from @xmath21788 and @xmath21833 .",
    "this system overlaps the broad absorption in velocity space , precluding an accurate estimate of the column density from the lyman - edge opacity , since the relative contribution of each system to the flux depression around @xmath55 is not known .",
    "however , given that we find in  [ sec : cover ] that most of the neutral hydrogen from the bal system covers only @xmath5620% of the continuum source , we can conclude that at least some of this flux depression must be due to the lyman limit of the @xmath51 system , since the full depression is @xmath5640% of the total continuum flux .",
    "this enables us to estimate that the total column of neutral hydrogen in this system probably lies in the range @xmath57",
    ". the system could be intrinsic rather than intervening ; however , given that the observed metal lines suggest a lower ionization level than the broad lines , we assume in our analysis that it is physically distinct from the highly - ionized bal system .",
    "the system at @xmath52 is identified mainly on the basis of the very strong lines of ly@xmath10  ( @xmath58 ) and ly@xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) that have unusually broad profiles , the ly@xmath10  line having a full width at zero absorption ( fwza ) @xmath61900",
    "@xmath25   and ly@xmath59 having a fwza@xmath61750 @xmath25 .",
    "a weak ly@xmath8 feature can be seen , as well as a possible feature from @xmath21977 blended with the broad absorption of @xmath21521 .",
    "it is difficult to confirm the presence of any lyman - limit feature , which should lie at @xmath62 , due to the uncertain continuum shape in this region .",
    "there does appear to be some small decrease in the flux , but the situation is complicated by the fact that qsos can only rarely be observed so far into the rest - frame uv , and consequently knowledge of the broad emission line properties in this region is extremely limited .",
    "we estimate @xmath63 .",
    "the redshift of the @xmath5 system is calculated from the strong @xmath232796 , 2804 doublet that occurs around @xmath64 .",
    "absorption from ly@xmath10  and possibly @xmath231548 , 1551 are also detected .",
    "none of the higher - order lyman lines can be seen since they lie below the wavelength coverage of our data . however , the system is firmly established by the doublet and by the presence of the strong lyman - limit feature at @xmath65 visible in the hut spectrum of this object ( figure  [ fig : hutspec ] ) .",
    "we have identified broad absorption features corresponding to resonance lines of , , , , through , , , and .",
    "each feature is primarily characterized by a single trough that is blue - shifted at line center by @xmath66 @xmath25  with respect to the rest frame and has a width of @xmath67 @xmath25 .",
    "the troughs are fairly flat across the bottom with no obvious consistent structure and have sharp velocity cutoffs on both the red and blue end . because of the high ionization levels and small widths of the lines ,",
    "many of the doublets are resolved in velocity space , including @xmath23770 , 780 , @xmath23610 , 625 , and @xmath23499 , 521 . the lyman - series lines through ly@xmath53 are also resolved , with the exception of ly@xmath59 which is strongly blended with @xmath231032 , 1038 .",
    "there are several other possible lines that are either part of a strong blend or occur in portions of the spectrum where the continuum level is not well - defined and hence the existence of the line is difficult to determine :    1 .",
    "absorption from @xmath21788 could be present around @xmath68 , but the continuum shape is uncertain due to the broad emission line and a blend of narrow absorption lines .",
    "there appears to be some slight evidence for an @xmath21630 feature around @xmath69 , but the absorption is either weak or the covered fraction is small ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "also , this lies in between the apparent broad emission line and the @xmath21625 bal , again making the continuum shape uncertain .",
    "3 .   there is a dip in the flux shortward of an apparent broad emission line around @xmath70 , possibly @xmath21559 + @xmath21568 .",
    "the dip extends from @xmath71 to @xmath72 and could be a blend of several possible bals including @xmath23553 , 554 , @xmath21568 , @xmath21559 , and @xmath23550 , 568 .    for the reasons stated above and the uncertainties in the profiles , we make no attempt to fit or deblend any of the above lines .",
    "we did measure the equivalent width of the broad feature around @xmath73 since this feature appears to be well - defined .",
    "this is likely a blend of @xmath21433 , @xmath21430 , and possibly @xmath21429 .",

    "all of the identified broad absorption features are labeled , as are the prominent broad emission lines and several intervening absorption features .      for fitting purposes we attempted to develop optical depth templates from various observed absorption profiles such as @xmath231548 , 1551 and @xmath23770 , 780 ( see korista",
    "_ et al . _",
    "however , we found that no single derived optical depth template was able to fit all of the observed lines satisfactorily , due mainly to slight variations in the widths of the profiles . instead of a rigid template ,",

    "both profiles are capable of producing reasonable fits to the data , which is why we fit every feature with each profile . because we created the flat profile specifically to fit the shapes of the observed absorption features",

    "hence , to choose an intrinsic ionizing continuum for our photoionization models , we defer to the uv observations and use the extrapolated power law with index @xmath245 shown in figure  [ fig : broadband ] .",

    "[ sec : xray ] . in ",
    "[ sec : altcont ] we discuss the effect of choosing an alternative continuum shape .",
    "all of our calculations were performed with the photoionization code cloudy ( version 90.01 ; ferland 1996 ) .",
    "we assume that the bal gas is in photoionization equilibrium with the intrinsic qso continuum and has solar chemical abundances .",
    "we use a constant density of @xmath246 , although it has been previously established ( _ e.g. _  hamann _ et al . _  1995 ) in similar models that the ionization state of the gas is not sensitive to the absolute density ( up to a limit of @xmath247 ) .",
    "hence our results are valid for any reasonable space density , so long as it is constant .",
    "the continuum normalization is determined by the ionization parameter @xmath248 , defined as the ratio of the number density of ionizing photons ( energy above the ionization threshold of hydrogen ) to hydrogen nuclei , @xmath249 where @xmath250 is the frequency at the hydrogen ionization threshold .",
    "we do not assume that the gas is optically thin to the ionizing continuum .",
    "in fact , given the necessarily large total column densities that we infer , continuum opacity must be an important factor and will alter the spectral energy distribution of the ionizing continuum as it propagates through the bal gas , resulting in changes in the ionization state .",
    "the simplest model of the bal gas is a single slab characterized by its total column density @xmath251 and the ionization parameter @xmath248 at the face of the slab .",
    "we use our measured limits on the ionic column densities to constrain the total column density and ionization parameter for such a model .",
    "we illustrate this in figure  [ fig : nuplaneone ] by plotting in the @xmath252 parameter space contours of constant ionic column density equal to a few of our lower limits , including those which provide the most restrictive constraints on the parameters .",
    "the contour for corresponds to a column density of @xmath253 @xmath12 .",
    "models consistent with our lower limits on the column densities must lie above the solid lines .",
    "we also include a constraint from the lack of absorption . by fitting the data assuming a flat absorption profile with a centroid at @xmath254 @xmath25 , a width of @xmath255 @xmath25 , and a covered fraction of @xmath9",
    ", we derive an upper limit on the column density of of @xmath256 @xmath12  with 90% confidence .",
    "this upper limit is represented by the dashed line in figure  [ fig : nuplaneone ] .",
    "models consistent with the upper limit must lie below the dashed line to avoid producing an observable amount of .",
    "thus the shading indicates the region of parameter space consistent with our column density limits in this simple model .",
    "the existence of a region in the @xmath252 parameter space that satisfies all of our column density constraints means that , based on the column density limits alone , we could explain the observations by a model of a single , marginally optically thick , bal region of constant density .",
    "in such a model the large range of ionization states is possible because the very high - ionization states would exist near the face of the slab , whereas the lower - ionization states exist deeper in the slab ( _ i.e. _  farther from the continuum source ) as a result of x - ray self - shielding .",
    "however , to understand the bal system we would like to be able to explain not only the ionization state of the gas but also the covered fractions , and in particular the correlation of a higher covered fraction with a higher state of ionization . this would be impossible to achieve in a single - zone model .",
    "we now discuss how we can modify this simple single - slab picture to arrive at a more plausible explanation of the covered fractions .",
    "multiple zones are necessary to explain the range in covered fractions that we observe .",
    "empirically , what is required is that the high - ionization gas have a larger covered fraction than the lower - ionization gas .",
    "here we divide the bal region into two zones , one with a low covered fraction contributing the absorption from the higher - order lyman lines and perhaps also and , and another with a higher covered fraction providing the dominant absorption source of the higher - ionization species , up through . we will refer to these as the `` smaller '' and `` larger '' zones , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : nuplanetwo ] shows the constraints for each zone provided by our observed column density limits as in the single - slab case . for the larger zone we apply an additional constraint provided by the fact that absorption clearly can not be optically thick in this zone . in the same manner as described in the previous section for , but here assuming a covered fraction of @xmath257 , we place an upper limit of @xmath258 @xmath12  on the column density of . placing upper limits on the column densities of and results in constraints that are very similar but slightly less - restrictive , so they are not shown .",
    "further plausible physical assumptions can place more restrictions on the possible range of parameter space covered by the two zones .",
    "for example , we could assume that the clouds that make up the bal gas are equidistant from the central radiation source , but have small , dense cores surrounded by lower - density halos .",
    "the cores would naturally have a lower ionization parameter , and they would cover a smaller fraction of the source .",
    "more generally , one could envision a density - fluctuated medium containing small , dense clouds of radius @xmath259 , and larger , lower - density clouds of radius @xmath260 satisfying the constraint @xmath261 , where we use the subscripts @xmath262 and @xmath263 to denote the smaller and larger zones , respectively .",
    "we can relate the cloud radii to their column densities as @xmath264 . since @xmath265",
    ", we have @xmath266 . assuming the two zones are at roughly the same distance @xmath267 from the continuum source",
    ", we can therefore write the size constraint as @xmath268 .",
    "this reduces the range of acceptable two - slab models in the four - dimensional parameter space spanned by @xmath269 , @xmath270 , @xmath271 , and @xmath272 . by considering the effect of this constraint on the solutions shown in figure  [ fig : nuplanetwo ] ,",
    "we conclude that , in this density fluctuation model , the ionization parameter in the smaller zone must be a factor @xmath18 lower than in the larger zone , which would correspond to a larger density in the smaller zone by the same factor .",
    "density fluctuations in the bal gas and the resulting correlation between covered fraction and ionization state could have implications for the determination of chemical abundances in bal systems .",
    "studies of bal systems typically find that a large range in ionization parameters ( more than an order of magnitude ) and large abundance modifications relative to solar ( as much as an order of magnitude , or even two for nitrogen ) are necessary to explain the observed column densities ( _ e.g. _  turnshek _ et al . _  1996 ) .",
    "the large metallicity enhancements are required primarily because of the observed weakness of the ly@xmath10  bal , which is used to derive the column density .",
    "however , in the bal system of sbs1542 + 541 , the small equivalent width of ly@xmath10  despite a large optical depth ( @xmath273 ) is explained by the fact that most of the covers only a small fraction of the continuum source . as a result",
    ", the contribution from most of the is `` hidden '' beneath the absorption from more highly - ionized gas with a much lower column density but higher covered fraction .",
    "this situation is revealed by the direct observation of the saturated lyman lines of order ly@xmath8 and higher , lines that in a more typical bal system would not be visible due to blending with other lines , particularly @xmath21977 . if inhomogeneity of the bal gas is a generic feature of bal systems , particularly that which would result in large columns of hidden , then this could affect ( and make more difficult ) the measurement and interpretation of bal column densities and chemical abundances .    in this model , the source of the absorption is constrained to the small region of parameter space shown in figure  [ fig : nuplanetwo ] by the tight upper limit on absorption . however , it is possible that the absorption arises in a very weakly - ionized zone ( @xmath274 ) with a low enough column density ( @xmath275 @xmath12 ) that no strong low - ionization metal absorption lines are produced .",
    "if such a zone exists , then the and lines require an additional higher - ionization zone .",
    "this arrangement is illustrated in figure  [ fig : nuplanealt ] , as calculated using continuum shape ( b ) from figure  [ fig : broadband ] ( see  [ sec : altcont ] ) .",
    "alternatively , they could be produced in the larger zone if the lines are assumed to be not optically thick .",
    "this is unlikely , however , since the profiles , particularly , strongly suggest saturation .",
    "although a two - zone model is the simplest one that can explain the basic properties of the system , including the observed line strengths and the general trend of the covered fractions , there are complications . in particular , the observed range in covered fractions for the highly - ionized species , especially the apparently high covered fraction of , can not be explained by a simple model .",
    "if this is a real effect , then the physical structure of the bal gas could be extremely complex , and much more detailed modeling would be necessary to reproduce this peculiar behavior .",
    "however , it is entirely possible that this effect is simply due to the uncertainties induced by blending and the choice of fitting profile .",
    "the correlation of covered fraction with ionization state can also be explained by more complex physical models .",
    "it is plausible that the bal region has an overall disk - like geometry as suggested by the high continuum and even higher trough polarization observed in balqsos ( goodrich & miller 1995 ; cohen _ et al . _  1995",
    "this has been explored theoretically in the disk - wind models of agn broad line regions ( murray _ et al . _  1995 ; murray & chiang 1995 ) .",
    "one can imagine that we are looking along a particular line of sight , just above ( or below ) the disk , as illustrated schematically in figure  [ fig : disk ] .",
    "the states of lower ionization , being farther from the continuum source , would naturally have a smaller covered fraction .",
    "an appealing consequence of this interpretation is that the bal region that we observe in sbs1542 + 541 would not be required to be inherently exceptional in its lack of absorption from states of lower ionization such as , , and .",
    "these ions could be part of the bal region but be far enough from the continuum source that they lie outside our line of sight .",
    "the existence of high column densities of highly - ionized gas suggests that the uv absorption system of sbs1542 + 541 is associated with a `` warm absorber '' as seen in the x - ray spectra of many low - redshift agn .",
    "models of x - ray warm absorbers ( netzer 1993 ; krolik & kriss 1995 ; netzer 1997 ) predict that the strongest features should be the k ionization edges of and as well as k and l edges of ionization stages of iron @xmath56 . according to our photoionization calculations ,",
    "given the likely range of ionization parameters for the bal gas in sbs1542 + 541 , the dominant stages of oxygen should be and .",
    "the predicted large column densities of these ions should produce observable ionization edges at @xmath276 kev ( ) and @xmath277 kev ( ) , each with an optical depth of @xmath278 .",
    "observations of these x - ray features would enable us to form a much more complete picture of the ionization state of the system , making this object a good candidate for further study of the unification of x - ray / uv absorbers ( mathur _ et al . _  1994",
    "; mathur , elvis , & wilkes 1995 ; mathur , wilkes , & aldcroft 1997 ) .",
    "we now consider the possibility that the weak x - ray flux is an intrinsic characteristic of the continuum being intercepted by the bal region ; _ i.e. _ it is not due primarily to x - ray absorption by the bal gas itself .",
    "for this purpose we have repeated our photoionization calculations using the ionizing continuum shape labeled ( b ) in figure  [ fig : broadband ] . here",
    "we connect the x - ray continuum inferred from the _ rosat _ flux assuming @xmath279 with the euv continuum by arbitrarily introducing a break in the euv power - law index at the location of the ionization edge ( 54 ev ) .",
    "the break point is chosen to be consistent with the uv observations ( below our wavelength coverage ) , but at a low enough energy that it should maximize the effects on the results .",
    "naturally , due to the softer continuum , much higher ionization parameters are necessary to produce the highest observed ionization states , @xmath280 for .",
    "more interestingly , the contours of constraint from and shift relative to one another such that the solution for the smaller zone shown in figure  [ fig : nuplanetwo ] does not exist for this model .",
    "that is , one can not construct a simple model of the smaller zone that produces the necessary columns of , , and that does not also produce a large column density of . the only explanation in this model for the absorption , therefore , is that there is a very weakly - ionized , low column density zone as mentioned in  [ sec : twoslab ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : nuplanealt ] shows the location of such a zone in the @xmath252 parameter space , using upper limits of @xmath258 @xmath12  on ( from @xmath211335 ) and @xmath281 @xmath12on ( from @xmath21977 ) , again derived in the same manner as for .",
    "this would require an enormous spread in ionization parameters ( 5 orders of magnitude ) between the different zones .",
    "since the existence of a zone with such a different ionization state , yet having a very similar distribution in velocity space , is not particularly appealing , this indirectly suggests that the ionizing continuum extrapolated from the euv ( labeled ( a ) in figure  [ fig : broadband ] ) is a better representation of the true continuum and that the weak x - ray flux is indeed a consequence of x - ray absorption .",
    "the bal system of sbs1542 + 541 has several unusual properties .",
    "the most interesting are :    1 .",
    "the state of ionization is extremely high , higher than what is typically inferred for `` classical '' bal systems from the study of the uv absorption lines .",
    "strong absorption is present from the highly - ionized lithium - like ions of , , and even , which has a creation ionization potential of 476 ev .",
    "absorption from , nearly always present in bal spectra , is undetected .",
    "it should be noted that high ionization similar to this has been suggested in connection with bals , but this is based on x - ray rather than uv absorption properties ( mathur , elvis , & singh 1995 ) .",
    "the high state of ionization and large column density ( @xmath282 @xmath12 ) suggest that the bal system should be associated with an x - ray `` warm absorber '' .",
    "2 .   the covered fractions for the various absorbing ions are in at least some cases significantly less than unity .",
    "even more interesting is that the covered fraction is apparently ion - dependent with a general trend towards higher covered fractions with higher states of ionization .",
    "this could be caused by either a special line of sight through a bal disk or by the existence of multiple ionization zones in the bal gas , possibly as a result of density fluctuations .",
    "these properties make the bal system of sbs1542 + 541 observationally unique and certainly intriguing .",
    "it begs the question  is this system extraordinary , or is it telling us something important about the character of balqsos in general ?",
    "the weakness of the standard bals of ly@xmath10 , , , and is clearly unusual compared to `` classical '' balqsos .",
    "however , the lack of observed and other low - ionization species itself is perhaps not so surprising given the weakness of , particularly if complex covered - fraction effects are involved .",
    "the very high - ionization species we observe in sbs1542 + 541 occur in the rest - frame euv , a spectral region not usually observable due to intervening lyman - limit absorbers .",
    "hence the existence of these ions is not inconsistent with other balqsos , for which it is not possible to confirm or deny their presence .",
    "it therefore seems plausible that the ionization state of this system is similar to that of normal balqsos . if the existence of large column densities of very highly - ionized gas and/or non - trivial ionization structure as we find in sbs1542 + 541 are common properties of bal systems , then this object could indeed be providing important clues to the nature of the bal phenomenon .    this work is based on observations with the nasa / esa hubble space telescope , obtained at the space telescope science institute , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , inc .",

    "<S> we have analyzed the broad absorption line system of the bright ( @xmath0 ) high - redshift ( @xmath1 ) qso sbs1542 + 541 using uv spectra from the hst fos along with optical data from the mmt and the steward observatory 2.3 m telescope . </S>",
    "<S> these spectra offer continuous wavelength coverage from @xmath2 to @xmath3 , corresponding to @xmath4 in the qso rest frame . </S>",
    "<S> the line of sight to the object contains only three identified intervening lyman - limit absorption systems . </S>",
    "<S> only one of these is optically thick at the lyman edge , a low - redshift ( @xmath5 ) system with a strong lyman edge observed at @xmath6 ( @xmath7 in the rest frame ) in a hopkins ultraviolet telescope spectrum from the astro-2 mission . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra therefore offer a rare opportunity to study broad absorption lines in the rest - frame extreme uv .    </S>",
    "<S> we find that the broad absorption line system is lacking in species of relatively low ionization often seen in broad absorption systems , such as , , and . instead , the system is dominated by very high - ionization species . </S>",
    "<S> the strongest features correspond to , , and . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to other high - ionization lines , we identify apparently saturated broad lyman - series lines of order ly@xmath8 and higher .    </S>",
    "<S> there is strong evidence for partial occultation of the qso emission source , particularly from the higher - order lyman lines which indicate a covered fraction less than @xmath9 . with the exception of and , which are low - ionization species in the context of this system , </S>",
    "<S> all of the other lines depress the flux by more than 20% . </S>",
    "<S> absorption from ly@xmath10  also depresses the flux more than 20% , indicating that there are at least two different regions contributing to absorption . </S>",
    "<S> overall , the data suggest a correlation between a larger covered fraction and a higher state of ionization . </S>",
    "<S> these observations reveal inhomogeneity in the ionization structure of the broad absorption line gas .    </S>",
    "<S> we have used photoionization models to constrain the total column density and ionization state of the system . </S>",
    "<S> a single - slab model consistent with our observational limits on the column densities requires @xmath11 @xmath12  and an incident ionization parameter @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> since the observed covered fractions suggest multiple zones , we also produced a two - slab model and find @xmath14 and @xmath15 for the smaller zone , and @xmath16 @xmath12  and @xmath17 for the larger zone . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the different covered fractions can be explained by either a special line of sight through a disk - like geometry or by the existence of density fluctuations of a factor @xmath18 in the bal gas . </S>",
    "<S> the large column density and high state of ionization suggest that the system is likely associated with an x - ray `` warm absorber '' . </S>"
