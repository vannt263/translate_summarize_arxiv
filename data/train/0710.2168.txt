    "the historical motivation for the subject of this paper is rooted in luzin s conjecture ( 1913 ) , which asserts that the fourier series of a function @xmath1 converges pointwise to @xmath2 lebesgue - almost everywhere . in 1966 , l. carleson gave a positive answer to this conjecture in the celebrated paper @xcite .",
    "his result can be essentially reformulated - via @xcite - as follows : @xmath0 * theorem 0 . * _ if for @xmath3 we define the expression [ car ] cf(x):=_a>0|_e^iayf(x - y)dy| , then @xmath4 is of weak type ( 2,2 ) , i.e. : [ v2 ] cf_l^2,()a f_l^2 ( ) , where here , by convention , @xmath5 $ ] and @xmath6 is an absolute constant . _",
    "in addition to carleson s proof , we point out two more proofs of the above result : one due to fefferman @xcite , using a very beautiful geometric combinatorial argument , and the other due to lacey and thiele @xcite , inspired from the subtle techniques they developed for proving the caldern conjecture ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "now , given the statement of theorem 0 , it is natural to hope that this result may be set in a broader context .",
    "following this direction , stein conjectured that the generalized carleson operator defined by [ v3 ] c_df(x):=_deg(p)=d|_e^ip(y)f(x - y)dy| ( here @xmath7 , @xmath8 is a polynomial of degree @xmath9 , and @xmath3 ) @xmath0 obeys the same bounds as @xmath4 .",
    "in @xcite he proved this conjecture , subject to the key restriction that the supremum in be taken in the class of quadratic polynomials with no linear term . further , using the @xmath10 method and a variant of van der corput s lemma , stein and wainger @xcite extended this result for polynomials of any degree , but again without the first degree term .",
    "our aim in this paper is to provide a positive answer to this conjecture for the case @xmath11 .",
    "the main result of the article is given by :    [ ma ] let @xmath12 ; then the expression [ v4 ] tf(x):= c_2f(x)=_a , b|_e^i\\{ay+by^2}f(x - y)dy| satisfies @xmath13    combining this result with the techniques developed by stein in @xcite , we easily deduce :    [ co ] @xmath14 is of weak type ( 2,2 ) .",
    "the proof of theorem 1 is a combination of analytic and geometric facts ; it relies on a new perspective of the time - frequency localization of the quadratic phase to which we adapt the techniques presented in @xcite .",
    "one particular feature of this paper is that it presents for the first time a time - frequency proof of the boundedness of a maximal operator which is invariant under quadratic modulations .",
    "another novelty of this paper is that we show that one can prove the ( quadratic ) carleson theorem using a single dyadic grid partition ( on each axis defining the time - frequency plane ) .",
    "finally , given the powerful geometric intuition developed in fefferman s paper , and also the fact that many of the reasonings here rely on his work , we have chosen to present our paper maintaining the structure and some of the notations appearing in @xcite .",

    "finally , i am indebted to nicolae popa for introducing me to the field of harmonic analysis and for offering his constant moral support .",
    "as our problem is of a time - frequency nature , it will be based on two steps :    \\(a ) - a discretization procedure , in which we split our operator into  small pieces \" that are well - localized in both time and frequency .",
    "\\(b ) - a selection algorithm , which relies on finding ( qualitative and quantitative ) criteria depending on which we decide how to glue the above - mentioned pieces together to obtain a global estimate on our operator .    for task ( a )",
    ", we first need to study the symmetries of our operator .",
    "this is because these symmetries will determine the geometric properties of the time - frequency portrait of our operator , properties that will provide a significant indication of how to naturally decompose the operator  along its fibers . \"",
    "we define the following classes of symmetries as the space of functions which are @xmath15-integrable on any given unit interval . ] : @xmath01 ) modulations : @xmath16 @xmath02 ) quadratic modulations : @xmath17 @xmath03 ) translations : @xmath18 @xmath04 ) dilations : @xmath19    the key observation is that we can recover the operators @xmath4 and @xmath14 from the action of these symmetries ( particularly 1 ) and 2 ) ) on the hilbert transform ; for convenience , we work instead with @xmath20 . ] , defined by @xmath21    indeed , the periodic carleson operator    @xmath22 can be rewritten as [ v5 ] cf(x)=_c |m_chm_c^*f(x)| , while our periodic quadratic carleson operator @xmath23 can be rewritten as [ v6 ] tf(x)=_b , c |m_cq_bhq_b^*m_c^*f(x)| .",
    "( remark that in the previous formulas the action of translations and dilations is hidden in the structure of the hilbert transform , which is the unique - up to identity - @xmath15-bounded linear operator that commutes with both symmetries . )",

    "as announced , we first look at the simplest object , namely the hilbert transform ; we begin by isolating the kernel and splitting it - taking advantage of the dilation symmetry of @xmath29 - as follows : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is an odd function supported away from the origin and @xmath32 , @xmath33 ; consequently , [ hilb ] hf(x ) = _ k _ k(y)f(x - y)dy .",
    "now for each scale @xmath34 we take the collection @xmath35 of all dyadic intervals in @xmath36 $ ] of length @xmath37 . using the translation invariant property of @xmath29",
    "we write [ hils ] hf(x ) = _ k , jh_k , jf(x)=_k , j\\{_k(y)f(x - y)dy}_i_k , j(x ) , where @xmath38 is , as usual , the characteristic function of @xmath39 .",
    "now each @xmath40 has time support included in @xmath41 while on the frequency side it is  morally \" supported near the origin , in an interval of length @xmath42 .",
    "consequently , the time - frequency picture of @xmath29 is as given in figure 1 .",
    "the above story can be expressed more intuitively as follows : observe that the translation symmetry acts on the @xmath43-direction , while the dilation symmetry acts on the @xmath34-direction .",
    "if we approximate the piece @xmath44 by a smooth compactly supported function @xmath45 , then the time - frequency portrait of @xmath45 is a square of area one located near the origin .",
    "since @xmath46 is , roughly speaking , just a sum of dilations and translations of @xmath45 , by basic properties of the fourier transform we obtain figure 1 as the time - frequency picture of @xmath46 . from the figure we also note that the origin plays a special role in this decomposition .",
    "+ we now consider the carleson operator as described in .",
    "in this case we will have to deal with one more symmetry given by the modulation invariance property , so we will try first to understand a simpler situation , namely how @xmath47 acts on a smooth compactly supported function @xmath48 . as we may remark from figure 2 , in the time - frequency plane",
    ", @xmath49 will translate the rectangle representing the localization of @xmath48 by @xmath50 units in the frequency direction .     +",
    "now , as in , we have that @xmath51 and so combining this with the previous observation , we deduce that the time - frequency picture of @xmath52 will be nothing more than a frequency - translation by @xmath50 units of the corresponding picture of @xmath29 .    exploiting this fact in the form of",
    ", we conclude that the time - frequency localization of @xmath4 is as presented in figure 3 .",
    "+ remark that , unlike the hilbert transform case , there is no preferential point in the splitting of @xmath4 .",
    "also , this picture suggests that @xmath4 may be written ( after a linearization procedure ) as @xmath53 with each @xmath54 a linear operator localized in a certain ( heisenberg ) rectangle @xmath8 ( figure 3 ) .",
    "this is a key observation used explicitly in both @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we finalize part ( a ) of our program with the analysis of our operator @xmath14 .",
    "as before , we begin by isolating the extra symmetry - @xmath55 , that adds to those appearing in the previous cases .",
    "we will approach the study of the time - frequency representation of this quadratic symmetry from two perspectives : ( _ q1 _ ) a _ restrictive _ one and ( _ q2 _ ) a _ relational _ one .",
    "( _ q1 _ ) the _ restrictive _ perspective relies on the following basic approach : given an object ( schwartz function on @xmath56 ) - call it @xmath57 - describe ( in terms of a picture ) the space and frequency regions and @xmath58 , respectively . ]",
    "where  most \" of the information carried by the function is located .",
    "as one may notice this is an _",
    "absolute _ way of quantifying the object since it relies on studying the distribution of the @xmath59-norm of @xmath57 ( and respectively @xmath58 ) and not on how @xmath57 may relate ( interact ) with some other objects ( functions ) living in a given environment .",
    "reasoning in this spirit , ( for @xmath48 defined as above ) we have that the  moral \" support of @xmath60 is given by the support of @xmath48 ( here we rely on the equality @xmath61 ) is a multiplication operator and hence preserves the time localization of the object on which it acts - this being the main reason for which we will split our operator @xmath14 in pieces that are compactly supported in time . ] while , with the notations from figure 4 , we have that the  moral support \" of @xmath62 is identified with the frequency - interval @xmath63 . at this point , we observe that we lose the ( global ) heisenberg principle , this being one of the main difficulties that was standing against solving this conjecture .",
    "one may improve this time - frequency portrait if one further decomposes @xmath48 in pieces which are better adapted to the oscillation of the quadratic factor imposed by @xmath64 ; more exactly , writing @xmath65 with each @xmath66 and @xmath67 we squeeze the previous localization to a sequence of area - one blocks concentrated near the diagonal of the initial  big \" rectangle .",
    "now , even though on each such block - reflecting the time - frequency portrait of a @xmath68 - we recover the heisenberg principle , the parallelogram formed by their union still offers a poor ( global ) localization of @xmath60 . using this viewpoint",
    ", one can not do better .",
    "( _ q2 _ ) the _ relational _ ( relative ) perspective , as the name suggests , focuses on determining a contextual representation of our object depending on how it interacts with other objects  living \" in a given environment .",
    "more exactly , in our case the environment is formed by objects like @xmath69 and the interaction is given by the scalar product in @xmath70 .",
    "now taking , for example , the interaction [ intm ] |m_c , m_c| ( here @xmath71 ) we see that , applying the ( non-)stationary phase principle , is controlled by a quantity depending on the ratio of @xmath72 and the distance between the lines @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( where @xmath75 and @xmath48 is adapted to @xmath76 ) . by varying @xmath77",
    ", this quantity suggests that ( on the frequency side ) the information carried by @xmath78 should be localized  near the line \" @xmath73 and that this information is roughly constant on intervals of length @xmath72 . as a consequence we may interpret the relative time - frequency localization of @xmath78 as being given by the region ( rectangle ) centered near the line @xmath74 of width @xmath72 ( measured on frequency axis ) and with space support in the interval @xmath76 .    by analogy with the above description",
    ", we will now treat the following interaction : [ intq ] |q_b , q_b| .    as before , applying the ( non-)stationary phase principle we remark that is controlled by a quantity depending on the ratio of @xmath72 and the distance rather than @xmath79 .",
    "] between the lines @xmath80 and @xmath81 obtained by differentiating the polynomial phase .",
    "this fact invites us to think of the relative time - frequency localization of @xmath60 as being given by the region ( parallelogram ) centered near the line @xmath80 of width @xmath72 ( measured on the frequency axis ) and with space support in the interval @xmath76 .",
    "indeed , this perspective will prove to give an accurate geometric representation of the relations among our objects .    as a consequence",
    ", this should be the  true \" time - frequency  story \" reflected in pictures ( see figure 4 ) ; it is of _ relative _ nature since it tells us about the interaction of @xmath60 with an exterior object and not about @xmath60 itself .",
    "this time - frequency interpretation can be regarded as a way of drawing pictures in which besides the magnitude we also encode the oscillation of our function .",
    "is big on the whole interval @xmath63 , when tested against same - structure functions ( as in the expression @xmath82 ) the oscillations of @xmath62 come into play , canceling out most of the oscillations of @xmath83 up to the level given by the interaction of the corresponding parallelograms ( for further study of this interaction behavior as well as for some other local properties , see section 5 ) . ]",
    "+ the moral of this story is that while @xmath49 translates the time - frequency picture up and down , the operator @xmath64 realizes a shearing of the same picture .",
    "the idea presented above will be essential in the proof of theorem 1 , and might be quite productive in a series of other problems involving quadratic time - frequency analysis .",
    "now , coming back to our decomposition , if we let @xmath49 interfere with @xmath64 we obtain the  elementary cell \" of our operator modeled in @xmath84 ; from the previous discussion , this will be considered as being localized in a parallelogram of area one living near the line @xmath85 and with the same time localization as before ( figure 5 ) .",
    "+ once we have gained this intuition , given the form , it is natural to split @xmath14 in pieces that will be localized in the same ( relative ) region as our  elementary cells \" @xmath84 mentioned above .",
    "consequently , we will divide our time - frequency plane in parallelograms of area one as reflected in figure 6 .",
    "+ the exact procedure will be described in section 4 , and will have as a consequence @xmath86 with each piece @xmath87 having the time - frequency picture represented by the tile @xmath88 $ ] ( see section 3 for notations ) .",
    "this way we have highlighted the dual nature of this problem : an analytic formulation ( providing @xmath15 bounds for a certain object ) visualized in terms of geometric interactions of some families of parallelograms ( tiles ) .",
    "consequently , there will be no surprise that in the second stage of our program that we now initiate - the selection algorithm - the geometric point of view in quantifying different interactions among the  small pieces \" @xmath89 will play the essential role .",
    "indeed , we start by defining a measurable map that assigns to each point @xmath90 $ ] a line @xmath91 in @xmath92 ; then we can regard @xmath93 as assigning the values ( see section 3 for notations ) : [ tp1 ] x0 xi l_xp , [ tp2 ] x ( l_x \" ) xil_xp .",
    "this way @xmath93 ( and similarly @xmath94 ) encodes two different types of information : @xmath0 - @xmath95 forces us to consider the density of the  flow \" @xmath96 through the tile @xmath8 ( this concept will be made precise in section 5 - see @xmath97 - and will be called the  density factor \" of p ) , while @xmath98 implies that on fourier side , the information given by @xmath99 is localized near the central line of @xmath8 denoted @xmath100 . the interplay between these two features of @xmath89 ( or @xmath101 ) will be discussed in detail in section 5 , and it is the key fact in providing good bounds for the expression [ tp * ] _",
    "pt_p^*f_2 ^ 2=_p , p^*f , t_p^*f , where here @xmath102 is a certain finite collection of tiles and @xmath2 some fixed element in @xmath103 . in dealing with this problem ,",
    "we first need to understand the quantity [ tptp ] |^*f , t_p^*f | .    to obtain some intuition , we explain first the two possible extreme cases :    - when @xmath104 ( _ i.e. _ the diagonal term ) the relevant point of view is given by @xmath95 ; this is natural since @xmath105 and @xmath106 oscillate in the same region of the time frequency - plane , making the information offered by @xmath98 useless . consequently , the norm @xmath107 will measure the density of @xmath8 ( see @xmath108 and @xmath97 ) .    -",
    "when @xmath8 and @xmath109 are far apart from one another , @xmath110 is small either due to the time localization of @xmath111 or due to the relation @xmath98 that comes into play by forcing @xmath112 and @xmath113 to have different  moral supports \" .",
    "consequently , via @xmath95 and @xmath98 ( which also determines the time - frequency localization of @xmath114 and @xmath111 ) we expect the following principle to be true : [ prin ]    rl & + & whenp , p havelarge overlaps and high density ; + & when p , p havesmalloverlaps(are disjoint ) or + & low density .",
    "now this principle simultaneously offers and demands a lot of information :    \\(i ) on the one hand , it suggests that to obtain good control of @xmath115 we may need to split the family of tiles @xmath102 into sub - collections @xmath116 with each @xmath116 having uniform characteristics ( all the tiles inside it must have comparable densities and any interaction between two of them must have the same degree of overlapping ) , estimate separately each @xmath117 with bounds depending on the previously mentioned characteristics of @xmath116 , and then sum them up for obtaining the desired global bound .",
    "\\(ii ) on the other hand , it requires a clear formulation of the concepts : @xmath0a ) the density of a tile @xmath0 b ) the degree of the overlapping between two tiles .    part ( ii )",
    "will be the object of our study in section 5 .",
    "while ( ii ) - a ) will be straightforward , for ( ii ) - b ) we will introduce two ways of measuring the corresponding concept : a _ qualitative _ one , by defining an  almost \" order relation between tiles -  @xmath118 \" - ( definition 3 ) and a _ quantitative _ one , the actual measurement of how much two tiles @xmath119 overlap , that can be recovered from the geometric factor of the pair @xmath120 ( definition 1 ) .",
    "now , guided by the observation made in ( i ) , our proof will be based on two propositions corresponding to the two main ( geometric ) possibilities appearing in the study of a family of tiles ( having uniform density ) : proposition 1 will treat the case where our family consists of  disjoint \" ( _ i.e. _ not comparable under  @xmath121 \" ) tiles , while proposition 2 will deal with a family - called a  forest \" - that can be organized into a controlled number of clustered sets of tiles ( _ i.e. _ trees ) .    with this",
    "done we will proceed ( roughly ) as follows :    we will decompose @xmath122 into @xmath123 with @xmath124    using a combinatorial argument , we will further prove that @xmath125 may be written as a disjoint union of at most @xmath126 sets , @xmath127 , such that @xmath128 where , for each @xmath43 , @xmath129 is a family of at most @xmath126 disjoint tiles and @xmath130 is a forest . now , denoting @xmath131 propositions 1 and 2 will imply that the operator norm of @xmath14 acting from @xmath15 to @xmath15 . ]",
