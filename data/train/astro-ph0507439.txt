    "what happened in the early universe has a great influence on the history of the universe because they determined the initial conditions .",
    "it is very important to check whether our standard model of cosmology is correct or not as theories and observations develop .",
    "baryogenesis and bbn should be checked because they determine the history of the chemical evolution .    in the standard model of elementary particle physics ,",
    "the baryogenesis is possible only through the electro - weak spharelon process . in the supersymmetric standard model ,",
    "it is much easier to explain the baryon number asymmetry because there are many scalar fields which have baryon number .",
    "one of the most striking property of supersymmetric theories is that they have flat directions in potentials .",
    "some of them have baryon number and if fields condensate in these directions , it is possible to produce large baryon number .",
    "this is the basic idea of the affleck - dine baryogenesis  @xcite .",
    "usually baryon number production is assumed to be taken place homogeneously all over the space .",
    "this is natural because we know that the universe is homogeneous and if baryogenesis is inhomogeneous in large scale it contradicts observations  @xcite .",
    "of course resolution ability of observations is limited and small scale inhomogeneity is not excluded by observations . though it seems to be unnatural to consider such small scale inhomogeneity , recent observations force us to reconsider the possibility of inhomogeneous baryogenesis .",
    "it has become clear that the evolution of matter started earlier than we have known before .",
    "for example , wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) data suggests that reionization began when @xmath420 @xcite .",
    "according to refs .",
    "@xcite , star formation activity started when @xmath5 10 .",
    "in addition , it is known that the quasar metallicity did not significantly change from the time of high redshift to the present time  @xcite . recently a galaxy at @xmath6=10.0",
    "was observed  @xcite .",
    "other evidences of heavy elements from the high redshifts are given in @xcite    motivated by these observational evidences , we investigate the possibility that inhomogeneous baryogenesis produced very high baryon density in small fraction of the universe and in these regions some fraction of heavy elements were already synthesized during bbn .",
    "heavy elements production during bbn itself is not a new idea .",
    "previous researches on the inhomogeneous big bang nucleosynthesis are given in  @xcite .",
    "heavy elements production is also mentioned in  @xcite .",
    "these works , however , do not include very heavy elements  @xcite or they create neutron rich regions and calculate the nucleosynthesis in those regions  @xcite .",
    "these are not suitable for our present purpose .    for the production of heavy elements during bbn ,",
    "high baryon density is necessary .",
    "however if we simply increase the baryon - photon ratio all over the universe homogeneously , it would apparently contradict the observed light element abundances  @xcite and cmbr  @xcite .",
    "instead , we assume that the baryon density of the universe is inhomogeneous before and during bbn .",
    "in most part of the universe @xmath7 is small ( @xmath8 ) as observed while small fraction of the universe is occupied with very high baryon density , @xmath9 .",
    "because our aim is to see how bbn goes in the high baryon density regions and not make the precise adjustment between bbn and cmbr , we neglect the baryon diffusion . in this case",
    ", the baryon density in high density regions can be treated almost free parameter without contradicting observations .",
    "( it is a complicated problem whether we can treat @xmath7 as a free parameter in realistic models .",
    "see , for example ,  @xcite . )    in section  [ theo ] we explain the theoretical aspects of our model  @xcite . in section  [ numerical ]",
    ", we explain our network and what kind of effects we take into account .",
    "section  [ results ] is the main results of our numerical study . in this section",
    "we explain bbn is the p - process like and simultaneously the r - process like . and also bbn can produce very heavy elements including proton rich nuclei such as @xmath10 .",
    "theoretical background of this model is inhomogeneous baryogenesis  @xcite .",
    "we are going to explain basic aspects of this model . for more detail , see  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of the model @xcite is a modified version of the affleck - dine baryogenesis  @xcite .",
    "assume that the interaction lagrangian has the general renormalizable form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is affleck - dine ( ad ) field , @xmath13 is the inflaton field , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the coupling constants and @xmath16 .    in a simplest case , the effective mass of the ad field @xmath12 can be written by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the vacuum mass of @xmath12 .",
    "the vacuum expectation value of @xmath13 is assumed to evolve from very large value , i.e. , @xmath19 , decreases to zero .",
    "as @xmath13 goes down to @xmath20 , the effective mass square of @xmath12 becomes negative and the phase transition takes place . when @xmath13 is far from @xmath21 the mass square is positive . if the duration of @xmath22 is short , the transition would take place only in a small fraction of space .",
    "consequently in the dominant part of the universe baryon asymmetry is small as observed @xmath23 , while in a small part of the universe the baryon asymmetry can be very large , even close to unity . in this simple model ,",
    "the signature of barionic charge is not fixed .",
    "baryonic chaege can become both positive and negative @xcite .",
    "however , the high density regions are very small compared to cosmological scale , high density anti - matter regions would disappear by pair - annihilation while late time inflation can prevent the annihilation @xcite .    because we are not very interested in the detail of the shape of the bubbles and the effect of diffusion in this paper , we assume that the bubble sizes are large enough to neglect the diffusion effects . also , bubbles are not large so as to contradict the observations  @xcite .    in this case",
    ", the bbn calculation can be treated as that of homogeneous big bang nucleosynthesis . in the following section",
    ", we present the results of the calculations and their physical interpretations .    at first sight , in the high baryon density regions the reaction seems to proceed along the proton rich side because bbn occurs in proton rich environment  @xcite .",
    "however , surprisingly it is not correct .",
    "bbn proceeds along the * proton rich * and the * neutron rich * side .",
    "the basic method of our calculation is the same as that of the homogeneous big bang nucleosynthesis .    we solve the friedmann equation @xmath24 where @xmath25 , and",
    "@xmath26 is the scale factor .",
    "the energy conservation law is @xmath27 for the time evolution of the temperature and the baryon density .",

    "nuclear data , such as reaction rates , nuclear masses , and partition functions , are same as in  @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that both proton - rich and neutron - rich nuclei are produced in a high density region ( fig .",
    "[ 600 ] ) .",
    "therefore it is required using a large network to calculate abundances in the high @xmath7 region .",

    "the reactions are stagnated and the reaction paths are bent .",

    "not only light elements which are synthesized in standard bbn but also very heavy elements are produced .",
    "we found bbn is both the p - process like and the r - process like . the transition from the p - process to the r - process is due to the coulomb barriers of proton - rich nuclei and the amounts of neutrons when heavy elements begin to be synthesized .",
    "the loci of the reaction flows change drastically above @xmath58 . above @xmath61 , a lot of seed nuclei cause active proton capture and",
    "the reaction flows end before very heavy elements are synthesized .",
    "our calculations demonstrate that very heavy elements can be synthesized in bbn , including proton - rich nuclei .",
    "these nuclei will be related to the origin of the solar abundances , heavy elements observed in high redshifts and early star formations via cooling effects .    for more realistic models in bbn ,",
