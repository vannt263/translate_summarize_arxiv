    "alma ( atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ) consists of fifty 12-m antennas and `` atacama compact array ( aca ) '' @xcite .",
    "the aca antennas are composed of four 12-m antennas for total power observation and twelve 7-m antennas for short - baseline interferometer .",
    "the aca correlator proforms the processing of astronomical signals from all the aca antennas .",
    "astronomical correlator calculates correlation coefficients between the signals from antennas , and it has a function to arbitrarily change the integration time and frequency resolution to get the data to be handled easily",
    ". it also provides information on frequency spectral profiles .",
    "the newly developed aca correlator adopts `` fx '' architecture , in which the fourier transform is performed before a cross multiplication .",
    "alma is a general - purpose millimeter and submillimeter telescope which can observe all kinds of astronomical objects in the range of its angular resolution .",
    "there are many scientific goals , and sensitivity , frequency resolution , and frequency coverage are key factors to achieve the various scientific goals .    in alma , the quantization loss is required to be smaller than 12 % , which is the value of 2-bit quantization , by performing quantization with 3-bit 4gsps . to achieve this requirement",
    ", aca correlator processes the digital signals of 3-bit 4gsps without reducing the number of bits .",
    "in addition , the correlator is designed to achieve high spectral dynamic range of @xmath0 .",
    "the aca correlator also supports wide variety of flexible spectral configurations ( combinations of frequency resolution and coverage ) for observations which span from wide continuum emission to high - resolution maser emissions .",
    "major specifications of the aca correlator performance are listed in table [ tbl:1 ] .",
    "the aca correlator was installed in the room of array operation site technical building at an altitude of approximately 5000 meters ( figure [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "the correlator processes 8-baseband signals from 16 antennas with 8 racks .",
    "each two racks perform all the necessary processes for one pair of dual polarization signals , and they are composed of three kinds of box - like modules .",
    "also , module structure can be easily replaced by a few persons at the high site from the viewpoints of operability and maintainability .",
    "we have performed verification tests of design and implementation for the scientific function , stability , and performance of the aca correlator .",
    "the output of calculated results from the aca correlator were checked to be bit - accurately coincident with our developed simulator using known input data , for various sets of correlator configurations .",
    "figure [ fig:2 ] demonstrates an example of verification tests of aca correlator using known data .",
    "we conducted long - term integration test of analog noise in order to verify the performance of aca correlator . in this test , we verified the following two items by inputting 1-bit digitized thermal noise to the correlator and integrating the cross - correlation products for 8 hours :      figure [ fig:3 ] shows this test results , which confirm the two verification items ; the left plot clearly shows there is no artificial pattern caused by digital processing , and for the right plot it can be clearly seen that the noise level decreases in proportion to @xmath1 .",
    "we also conducted the test of receiving signals from alma antennas and data processing at array operation site ( aos ) , and verified that the aca correlator successfully received the signals and processed the digitized data without any problems ( figure [ fig:4 ] ) ."
