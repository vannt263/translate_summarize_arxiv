    "one may say that we are entering the decade of _ multi_particle / jet physics .",

    "\\3 ) jet structure : the more information about the matrix elements is known the better the internal structure of a jet can be described .",
    "it is important to note that the ability to detect new physics at the lhc and tevatron crucially depends on the understanding of the corresponding standard model backgrounds .",
    "all that is sufficient motivation to treat the generic multi ",
    "particle / jet final states at the next  to  leading order ( nlo ) level .    presently our computational skills for describing n  jet production at nlo end already at n=3 .",
    "the pioneering work to calculate the amplitudes for two  jet processes at nlo in hadronic collisions was accomplished by ellis and sexton in 1986 @xcite .",
    "the partonic amplitudes relevant for 3 jet production were provided by bern , dixon and kosower @xcite and kunszt , signer , trocsanyi @xcite in 1993/94 .",
    "new technology was invented for these calculations borrowed partly from string theory .",
    "further , supersymmetry relations were exploited and helicity methods were applied at the nlo level @xcite .",
    "other needed ingredients were reduction formulas for feynman parameter integrals with nontrivial numerators and representations of scalar 5point functions ( pentagon integrals ) @xcite .",
    "for qcd the step to nlo 6point amplitudes has not been taken yet , albeit its phenomenological relevance for collider physics .",
    "to understand the organization of hexagon amplitudes and their efficient computation it is necessary to investigate examples which do not exhibit the full complexity of a generic gauge theory amplitude .",
    "an amplitude which contains only scalars as external particles is likely to be a good candidate .",
    "let us consider 6scalar scattering in the yukawa model .",

    "the amplitude for the trivial permutation is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 .",
    "working out the spinor trace one ends up with scalar products of loop and external momenta .",
    "one can show that all scalar products which contain loop momenta can be expressed as inverse propagators which can be canceled directly . in this way one is getting rid of all loop momenta in the numerator , or in other words : the yukawa amplitude for multi ",
    "scalar scattering has a trivial tensor structure .",
    "a given graph of the scalar hexagon amplitude decays immediately into scalar 3,4,5,6point integrals .",
    "the representation of the amplitude in terms of these scalar integrals is not useful as spurious infrared poles are present which have to cancel in the full amplitude .",
    "one can show that none of the graphs is actually infrared divergent .",
    "the tool to make the infrared cancellations manifest are scalar reduction formulas .",
    "point n  dimensional scalar integral integral in feynman parameter space is given by @xmath5 and the following reduction formula holds @xmath6 @xmath7 is the matrix which carries the kinematic information .",
    "its entries are mandelstam variables @xmath8 formed by the external momenta @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 stands for the @xmath11th pinch integral of @xmath12 , means one leaves out the @xmath11th propagator in the momentum representation . the reduction coefficients @xmath13 are the solutions of a simple linear equation @xmath14",
    ". they will play a special role in what follows .",
    "they can be written very compactly in terms of spinor traces .",
    "for example @xmath15 and the other b s are obtained by cyclic permutations . here",
    "@xmath16 is a shorthand for @xmath17 , for details see @xcite .",
    "applying the reduction formulas allows to express each feynman diagram in terms of triangle graphs with 0,1 or 2 light  like external momenta and 6dimensional box functions . only the triangle graphs with light  like legs carry infrared poles .",
    "as each individual feynman diagram is infrared finite , these triangle graphs have to cancel .",
    "the cancellations of the infrared divergent triangles gave rise to very interesting insights .",
    "a number of nonlinear constraints between mandelstam variables which are represented _ linearly _ in terms of the reduction coefficients , e.g. one finds @xmath18 this made the whole structure of the calculation very transparent and an astonishingly compact result for the yukawa 6scalar amplitude could be derived @xcite .",

    "this can be understood by the fact that the dilogarithms which are present at intermediate steps can be related to single pole contributions from triangle graphs with one light ",
    "like leg and is infrared divergent .",
    "as the infrared divergence vanishes , the dilogarithms also have to vanish .",
    "the remarkably simple form of the amplitude could be achieved because it was understood that the reduction coefficients @xmath22 are the natural building blocks of the amplitude .",
    "this lead to the _ conjecture _ that massless hexagon amplitudes in general gauge theories can be represented most compactly as some linear combination of reduction coefficients . still the conjecture has to be if not proven then at least confirmed by other calculations which exhibit a non  trivial tensor structure .",
    "to study an amplitude with a non  trivial tensor structure we considered the gauged version of eq .",
    "( [ defyukawamodel ] ) . for example",
    "the fermion loop contribution to the @xmath24 amplitude is given by a sum over permutations of feynman diagrams which differ only by the position of the photons and scalars at the fermion loop .",
    "@xmath25 with , e.g. @xmath26 here @xmath27 are the helicities of the photons .",
    "@xmath28 are the propagator momenta .",
    "the amplitude exhibits an @xmath29 bose symmetry , as the scalars are freely interchangeable . for a given ordering of the scalars",
    "one finds 20 different feynman diagrams corresponding to the different possibilities to attach the two photons .",
    "this set forms a gauge invariant sub  set of all feynman diagrams .",
    "it is sufficient to consider this sub  set and performing the summation over remaining permutations explicitly .      to cope with the combinatorial complexity of hexagon",
    "amplitudes it is useful to split the problem into irreducible pieces as far as possible .",
    "the guidelines are the analyticity and lorentz structure of the amplitude together with gauge invariance .",
    "the external momenta @xmath30 obey momentum conservation . to make this explicit we introduce the five vectors @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "we assume for the moment that the kinematics is non  exceptional , i.e. the 5 vectors define a 5dimensional subspace of the n  dimensional space .",
    "the scattering tensor @xmath33 has the following general decomposition @xmath34 this representation contains 26 coefficients .",
    "the transversality conditions @xmath35 , @xmath36 reduce the number of relevant coefficients to 17 .",
    "further , by gauge invariance @xmath37 which leads to 7 independent linear relations between the tensor coefficients . they may be used to express all 17 coefficients in terms of 10 unconstrained coefficients , e.g. @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "it follows that one has to calculate only these 10 independent coefficients .",
    "note that gauge invariance is completely exploited in this way . on the other hand , calculating more coefficients and confirming the ward identities explicitly provides a test of the calculation . by using helicity methods",
    "directly one also sees that 10 tensor coefficients are sufficient to determine the full amplitude .",
    "the problem is now reduced to the computation of 10 tensor coefficients for 20 6point feynman diagrams .",
    "the tensor coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ abs ] ) can be determined by acting with projection operators onto each feynman diagram .",
    "this may be achieved by defining @xmath41 @xmath42 is the inverse of the @xmath43 gram matrix defined by @xmath44 .",
    "note that the inverse of @xmath45 is only defined if @xmath46 .",
    "this will not lead to a problem as one can cancel the inverse matrices before the limit @xmath47 has to be taken .",
    "one may easily check the following relations for the tensors @xmath48 and @xmath49 : @xmath50 @xmath51 is a projector onto the @xmath52 dimensional subspace perpendicular to the 5 dimensional space spanned by the vectors @xmath53 . @xmath54",
    "is the dual vector to @xmath55 relative to this @xmath52dimensional space . here and in the following we use summation conventions for lorentz and vector indices .    to determine the tensor coefficients , @xmath38 and @xmath56",
    ", we define the following linear operators @xmath57 { \\cal m}^{\\mu_1 \\mu_2 } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the action of dual vectors @xmath58 and projectors @xmath48 on lorentz indices induces a natural mapping from the momentum to the feynman parameter representation of the feynman diagrams .",
    "when acting on feynman diagrams one finds for example that @xmath59 where the parameter integrals with non  trivial numerators are defined by @xcite @xmath60 the reduction formulas necessary to express these integrals in terms of scalar integrals in shifted dimensions can be found in @xcite . after applying the reduction formula the tensor coefficient of each feynman graph",
    "is expressed in terms of scalar integrals with trivial numerators in shifted dimensions similar to the approach of @xcite .      after having reduced the scalar integrals with non  trivial numerators each graph",
    "is written as a linear combination of scalar 2 to 6point integrals in dimensions that are ranging from @xmath61 to @xmath62 . by applying the scalar reduction formula eq .",
    "( [ eqscalarreductionnt ] ) and explicit formulas for @xmath63dimensional triangle functions with light ",
    "like legs these integrals can be mapped to @xmath64 now each feynman diagram is decomposed into a linear combination of these functions . as each of the graphs is ir / uv finite , all ir / uv poles have to vanish .",
    "it turns out that the coefficients of @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 cancel as a whole in the amplitude .",
    "as we have proven in @xcite that all higher dimensional integrals with more than four external legs have to vanish also the @xmath68 part has to vanish on a graph by graph bases .",
    "note that the sorting into different scalar integrals is also a sorting into different analyticity classes , as different scalar integrals have different cut structures .",
    "no cancellations are to be expected between these classes and indeed are not observed .      with the procedure outlined above all tensor coefficients were calculated .",
    "the results for these are lengthy and not presentable . when combining them to form the actual @xmath69 and @xmath70 helicity amplitudes many interesting cancellations",
    "were observed which are due to the same relations that led to a compact result in the 6scalar case .",

    "the amplitude has indeed a simple representation in terms of reduction coefficients as conjectured above .",
    "it was pointed out that nlo corrections to multi  particle / jet production at future colliders should be included to have reliable theoretical predictions . on the way to understand the organization of 6point processes at the one  loop level analytical results have been presented for 6scalar scattering in the yukawa model .",

    "a result has been obtained in terms of tensor coefficients by exploiting the lorentz , gauge and analyticity structure as far as possible . for the @xmath69 helicity amplitude a very compact representation",
    "could be obtained .",
