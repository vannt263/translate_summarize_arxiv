    "experimentally observed@xcite quantum behavior of josephson vortices ( i.e. , fluxons ) at ultra - low temperatures has opened up a possibility of realizing quantum computers based on long josephson junctions ( ljjs ) .",
    "this observation led to much interest on josephson vortex quantum bit@xcite ( qubit ) as an alternative to the previously proposed superconducting qubits .",
    "similar to other approaches based on josephson junctions such as charge,@xcite phase,@xcite and flux@xcite qubits , josephson vortex qubit ( jvq ) is also a promising candidate for quantum computation application . due to its weak interaction with decoherence sources in the environment at low temperatures ,",
    "the jvq may have significant advantages over the other superconducting qubits .",
    "for instance , a significantly longer decoherence time was suggested as one such advantage.@xcite    the jvq takes advantage of the coherent superposition of two spatially separated states arising from the low temperture property of a trapped fluxon in a double - well potential .",
    "this property includes ( i ) energy quantization and ( ii ) macroscopic quantum tunneling@xcite(mqt ) .",
    "we note that , for linear ljjs , the fluxon potential for either metastable state or jvq may be obtained@xcite by using nb - alo@xmath1-nb junctions and by implanting either one or two microresistors in the insulator layer , respectively . for application of jvqs , tuning both the decoherence time and",
    "the level of entaglement by controlling the qubit property is essential .",
    "however , due to its weak interaction with external perturbations , an effective tuning mechanism for jvq is less clear .",
    "recent studies@xcite on using microwave cavity for both tuning a single phase qubit and inducing interaction between either two charge or two phase qubits suggest that resonant cavity may be used for jvq to serve the same purpose .",
    "earlier studies on the effects of resonant cavity indicate@xcite that both electric and magnetic fields of the cavity couple to the josephson junction since the cavity electromagnetic ( em ) mode behaves similar to a phonon mode@xcite which interacts with the fluxon .",
    "the effects of resonant cavity on the fluxon dynamics in ljj stacks@xcite have been studied both experimentally@xcite and theoretically.@xcite these studies show that when the coupling between ljj and resonant cavity is spatially uniform , no force is exerted on the fluxon by the cavity , but its dynamics may become modified .",
    "these studies suggest that the interaction between ljj and a resonant em wave mode of the cavity promotes@xcite collective dynamics of fluxons . the in - phase locking mode of the fluxon dynamics is shown to be enhanced@xcite by the cavity em mode .",
    "these studies also suggest that the junction - cavity interaction may be used to change the qubit property .",
    "the property of jvq depends on mqt between two spatially separated states of the fluxon .",
    "we note that mqt represents quantum particle - like collective exciations.@xcite as semi - classical theories indicate that the mqt rate@xcite depends on the potential barrier height , the jvq can be tuned by adjusting the potential - well for the fluxon .",
    "this adjustment can be achieved by potential renormalization induced by the junction - cavity interaction since this interaction can strongly affect the fluxon tunneling processes , similar to phonon assisted tunneling in josephson junctions.@xcite we note that a two - level atom interacting with a quantized radiation field , described by the jaynes - cummings model,@xcite is also similar to the jvq - cavity system that we consider in the present work .",
    "the potential renormalization for fluxon suggests that the resonant cavity may be used as a tool for controlling the jvq property .",
    "as the fluxon tunneling processes may be controlled externally by tuning either the junction - cavity coupling strength or the resonant frequency , the effects of the resonant cavity depend on the nature of the interaction .",
    "however , the influence of junction - cavity interaction on the mqt rate has not been understood clearly .    in this paper , we investigate the effects of the junction - cavity both on mqt from metastable state and on the ground - state energy splitting in a double - well potential .",
    "we note that , to focus on the interaction between ljj and a single resonant cavity mode , we consider only a high-@xmath0 cavity .",
    "first , we estimate the mqt rate for the fluxon in a single ljj and for the phase - locked fluxons in a coupled ljj stack by computing the local and non - local contributions .",
    "then , we estimate the effects of resonant cavity on the jvq property by computing the ground - state energy splitting . before proceeding further",
    ", we outline the main result .",
    "( i ) _ the potential barrier for a fluxon in the metastable state is not affected by increasing neither the junction - cavity interaction nor the resonant frequency of the cavity em mode_. ( ii ) _ the non - local contribution to the tunneling rate due to the junction - cavity interaction is negligible in the weak - coupling regime . _",
    "( iii ) _ due to potential renormalization induced by the junction - cavity interaction , the potenital barrier height for the fluxon trapped in a double - well potential is reduced .",
    "this reduction leads to increase in the ground - state energy splitting for the jvq with increasing junction - cavity coupling and resonant frequency_.    the outline of the remainder of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
