    "atom gravimeters , like other types of ballistic gravimeters , require the measurement result to be corrected for the vertical gravity gradient .",
    "the gradient in the correction formulas serves as influence quantity , and , according to the gum ( jcgm 100:2008 ) @xcite , its uncertainty should be included in the instrument s overall uncertainty budget . for many measurement sites with imprecisely known gravity gradient ,",
    "this uncertainty component can become a significant portion of the overall uncertainty , and in certain cases even dominate it .",
    "absolute gravimeters based on the tracking of macroscopic falling objects can generally avoid this problem by referring the measurement result to the so called `` effective measurement height '' , on which the measured gravity does not depend on its vertical gradient .",
    "the problem , however , can not be avoided in atom gravimeters , for which the effective measurement height is unknown .",
    "this communication determines the effective measurement height for both the``release '' and the `` fountain '' types of atom gravimeters and finds the uncertainty component introduced by referring the measured value to the atoms initial position .",
    "atom gravimeters deduce the gravity acceleration from the phase change of the matter waves associated with free falling atoms . to measure the change ,",
    "the group of atoms is first split and then recombined using a structure similar to the mach - zender interferometer .",
    "given the phases @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 of the matter wave at the moments @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 separated by the time interval @xmath7 , the measured gravity can be viewed as obtained from the formula @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the matter wave number .",
    "this treatment is essentially equivalent @xcite to the measurement of the positions @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 of the falling atom separated by the time interval @xmath7 and calculating the gravity as @xmath13 introducing the distances traveled by the atom as @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and corresponding time intervals as @xmath16 and @xmath17 , makes ( [ eq_3 points ] ) equivalent to the 3-level measurement schema ( fig.[fig_ag_schema ] ) with the working formula @xmath18 the above formula describes the gravimeter as linear time - invariant ( lti ) system , so the methods of lti - analysis developed for macroscopic ballistic gravimeters @xcite can be applied to atom gravimeters , at least for the analysis of disturbances common for both types of instruments .",
    "if the atom s acceleration changes during the measurement like @xmath19 the additional measured component caused by the term @xmath20 can be found as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the weighting function of the gravimeter , which for the 3-level schema ( [ eq_3 points ] ) is @xcite @xmath23 if the disturbance is expressed in terms of changing velocity or coordinate , the additional measured component can still be found as in ( [ eq_dg_meas ] ) , but instead of @xmath22 , the weighting functions by velocity @xmath24 or coordinate @xmath25 should be used ( fig .",
    "[ fig_ag_wfs ] ) .    as @xmath26",
    "the disturbance component can also be found as @xmath27 @xmath28 it s interesting to observe how the formulas ( [ eq_dz_meas ] ) and ( [ eq_3 points ] ) converge , highlighting the fact that the gravimeter s weighting function by coordinate is just the finite dirac comb providing sampling of the continuously changing coordinate .",
    "the constant vertical gradient @xmath29 changes gravity with height like @xmath30 where @xmath31 is gravity at some initial height , @xmath32 is the distance from that height .",
    "if the measured gravity can be presented as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is some gradient - independent value , then it follows from comparison of ( [ eq_g_z ] ) and ( [ eq_g_z_meas ] ) that @xmath35 which means that @xmath34 represents a distance from the initial position to the point at which the measured gravity equals local gravity .",
    "the locus of that point is called the effective measurement height of the instrument .",
    "the equation ( [ eq_g_z_g_meas ] ) holds true for any constant gradient . reporting",
    "the measured gravity at the effective measurement height does not involve the gradient value , and so its uncertainty does not affect the total uncertainty of the measurement . if the measured gravity is reported at the initial position , the uncertainty of the gradient @xmath36 propagates into the uncertainty of the measurement as @xmath37",
    "in this type of instruments the atoms are released for the free fall at some initial height .",
    "the measurement starts at the moment @xmath4 when the atoms separation from the initial position is @xmath10 .    due to the vertical gravity gradient @xmath29",
    "the gravity changes in time like @xmath38 we associate the initial velocity @xmath39 with the moment @xmath4 , at which the measurement starts , while @xmath31 is related to the initial position of the atoms . the changing acceleration ( [ eq_dg_grad ] )",
    "translates , according to ( [ eq_dg_meas ] , ) into the following measured gravity @xmath40 let @xmath41 be the length of idle part of the trajectory , @xmath42 be the total trajectory length .",
    "obviously , @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "taking into account that @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , we obtain @xmath49      in this type of instruments the atoms are thrown up vertically , the gravity is measured on both upward and downward parts of the trajectory .",
    "let s direct @xmath32-axis vertically and consider an atom thrown up along the axis .",
    "like before , we associate the atom s initial velocity @xmath39 with the start of the measurement at moment @xmath4 . due to the gradient",
    ", the gravity changes like @xmath50 the measured gravity , according to ( [ eq_dg_meas ] ) , is @xmath51 the result obtained in ( [ eq_g_upward_meas ] ) using the lti approach coincides with the results obtained with both the path integral and the perturbation lagrangian methods @xcite .",
    "let s now find the effective measurement height of the fountain gravimeter . in order for an atom to reach the apex of the trajectory in time @xmath7 ,",
    "the magnitude of the @xmath39 should be @xmath52 . substituting this value into ( [ eq_g_upward_meas ] ) we get @xmath53 as in fountain gravimeters the total height is @xmath54",
    ", we get @xmath55 which means that the effective measurement height for the fountain gravimeters is located above the initial position at @xmath56 as the gravity at the apex of the trajectory is @xmath57 , we can express the same as the following distance below the apex : @xmath58",
    "we have found the position of the point corresponding to the effective measurement height of the release and the fountain types of atom gravimeters . at that point",
    "the local gravity of the field with the constant vertical gradient is the same as the measurement result of atom gravimeter when it s not corrected for the gradient .",
    "leaving the gravity value for reporting at the effective measurement height allows to eliminate the error associated with the uncertainty of the gradient . for many gravity sites",
    "this uncertainty can not be estimated better than 10 @xmath0gal m@xmath59 @xcite .",
    "for the 12 cm of total trajectory length of release gravimeters @xcite this uncertainty , according to ( [ eq_h_z0 ] ) and ( [ eq_g_heff_fountain ] ) , translates into additional 0.35 @xmath0gal of uncertainty of the measured gravity value . for about the same trajectory length of the fountain gravimeters @xcite , the additional uncertainty of the measured gravity , according to ( [ eq_g_sym_wo_vo ] ) and ( [ eq_g_heff_fountain ] ) , can reach 1 @xmath0gal .",
