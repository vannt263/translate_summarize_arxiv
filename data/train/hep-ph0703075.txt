    "the interaction of an electron ( anti)neutrino with a nucleus @xmath3 naturally undergoing beta ( positron ) decay to the daughter nucleus @xmath4 @xmath5 shows the remarkable property of having no energy threshold on the value of the incoming neutrino energy .",
    "indeed , in these cases the energy balance of the corresponding beta decay reactions is such that @xmath6 with @xmath7 , @xmath8 the mass of neutral atoms .",
    "neutrino interaction of this type is thus always energetically allowed , no matter the value of the incoming neutrino energy @xmath9 .",
    "reaction   ( [ main ] ) will be denoted in the following as neutrino capture on beta decaying nuclei ( ncb ) . in the limit of vanishing values of neutrino mass @xmath10 and",
    "@xmath9 the neutrino contributes to ( [ main ] ) uniquely via its lepton flavor quantum number and in this case the electron in the final state has exactly the beta decay endpoint energy @xmath11 .",
    "however , for finite @xmath10 the electron kinetic energy is @xmath12 , while electrons emerging from the analogous beta decay has at most an energy @xmath13 , neglecting nucleus recoil energy .",
    "a minimum gap of 2@xmath10 is thus present and this at least in principle allows to distinguish between beta decay and ncb interaction .    in neutrino physics",
    ", ncb represents to date the only known reaction able to unambiguously detect electron ( anti)neutrino having arbitrary low energies .",
    "neutrinos with energies between 10 and 100 kev are still undetected even if some measurements have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "low energy neutrino physics is indeed crucial to clarify our picture of fundamental particle interactions .",
    "compelling results about neutrino mixing  @xcite and the corresponding non zero neutrino mass evidence raise a series of questions that could be addressed with the aid of the ncb process .",
    "the value of the absolute neutrino mass scale and the existence of low mass sterile neutrino mixing with ordinary flavors are examples of what can be done exploring this low energy regime .",
    "the idea of using ncb to measure the cosmological relic neutrino background predicted in the framework of the hot big bang model was already advocated many years ago in @xcite .",
    "the original idea was that if relic neutrinos have a large chemical potential @xmath14 , then both beta decays and ncb would show a depletion in the electron ( positron ) energy spectrum in a gap of order @xmath14 around the zero neutrino mass endpoint @xmath11 .",
    "presently , we know that these neutrinos have a number density of order @xmath15 @xmath16 neutrino ( or antineutrino ) per flavor and are characterized by a very small mean kinetic energy , of the order of 6.5 @xmath17 or 3.15 @xmath18 for nonrelativistic and relativistic neutrinos , respectively with @xmath19 ev .",
    "big bang nucleosynthesis constrains relic neutrino ",
    "antineutrino asymmetry , i.e. the ratio @xmath20 for electron neutrino to be very small @xmath21 , see e.g. @xcite , and this bound also applies to all active neutrino flavors because of the oscillation mechanism @xcite .",
    "this implies that , unless more exotic scenarios are considered , as a larger amount of relativistic degrees of freedom in the early universe , the effect of neutrino degeneracy in beta decays and ncb is too small to be detected experimentally .",
    "however , as we mentioned already for massive neutrinos a similar gap around @xmath11 is expected of the order of twice the neutrino mass , which for @xmath22 ev is several orders of magnitude larger than the corresponding effect due to neutrino - antineutrino asymmetry .    presently , neutrino mass in the ev range is still allowed by data .",
    "indeed , oscillation experiments only provide a lower limit to the mass of ( at least ) one neutrino mass eigenstate of the order of 0.05 ev @xcite , while direct measurements of electron energy spectrum in @xmath23h decay gives @xmath24 ev @xcite .",
    "a large improvement in this respect will be provided by the katrin experiment , whose expected sensitivity is 0.2 ev @xcite . on the other hand , cosmological data from cosmic microwave background anisotropies and large scale structure power spectrum",
    "provide an independent bound on the sum of neutrino masses which depending on the particular model adopted and the number of free parameter lies in the range @xmath25 ev , see e.g. @xcite for a recent review . as we will argue in the following ,",
    "if @xmath10 is in the ev range , future ncb experiments could represent an almost unique way to detect cosmological neutrinos .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that there are several possible sources of low energy neutrino fluxes which might be fruitfully studied using ncb .",
    "one example is provided by the thermal neutrino flux from the sun , due to compton pair production , free - bound electron transition and plasmon decay , which produce a neutrino / antineutrino flux in the energy range 1 ev - 10 kev , with an integrated flux of the order of @xmath26 @xmath27 s@xmath28 @xcite .",
    "neutrino diffused fluxes in the 10 kev - 1mev energy range are instead expected from galactic and extra - galactic star nuclear burning @xcite , as well as from pop iii stars @xcite and for this latter case , their detection may represent a first direct probe of this yet unseen metal - free first generation of stars .    of course , the strength of neutrino interaction with ordinary matter is very small and ncb makes no exception . in order to design an experiment probing yet unexplored neutrino backgrounds",
    "a detailed estimate of the cross section is mandatory .",
    "we consider in the following a method to evaluate ncb cross section that makes use of beta decay observables in order to minimize the uncertainties due to nuclear matrix element evaluation .",
    "this procedure allows to obtain an accurate numerical estimate of the cross section in a large variety of cases .",
    "when possible , a comparison with previous calculations made for some specific nuclei by previous authors  @xcite will also be performed , though ncb interaction in the low energy neutrino limit has not yet been systematically studied in literature .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we recall beta decay formalism and derive the expression for the ncb cross section which is then evaluated for several cases in section 3 . in section 4 the ncb to beta decay rate ratio",
    "is studied for the particular case of the cosmological relic neutrino background .",
    "finally , in section 5 we draw our concluding remarks .",
    "ncb and its corresponding beta decay are essentially the same phenomenon . in the case of",
    "unobserved polarization the two processes have the same invariant squared amplitude . in order to derive an expression for the ncb cross section we make use of the beta decay formalism , evaluating invariant amplitudes using the description of the fermions in terms of spherical waves and the computation of the corresponding nuclear state transition matrix elements .",
    "this approach is based on the so called long wavelength limit approximation @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the momentum of the incoming neutrino and @xmath32 the nuclear radius . due to the typical values of @xmath32",
    ", this approximation holds for ncb if the energy of the incoming neutrino satisfies the relation @xmath33 mev .",
    "assuming an isotropic neutrino flux , the ncb integrated rate is given by ( hereafter we use natural units ) @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the ncb cross section , @xmath36 and @xmath31 the modulus of neutrino velocity and momentum , respectively and @xmath37 the distribution function .",
    "for example , in the particular case of cosmological relic neutrinos it keeps a standard fermi - dirac form , @xmath38^{-1}$ ] up to very small non thermal corrections @xcite . following the formalism of  @xcite , for spin averaged initial state and unobserved polarization we have @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the fermi function . with @xmath41 and @xmath42",
    "we denote the energy and momentum of the outgoing electron respectively , where @xmath43 with @xmath44 the corresponding beta decay endpoint .",
    "finally , the rate can be expressed as an integral over the electron energy @xmath45 where eq .",
    "( [ relation ] ) should be used to express neutrino energy and momentum as function of @xmath41 .",
    "the ncb rate contains the nuclear shape factor @xmath46 , an angular momentum weighted average of nuclear state transition amplitudes , which depends upon the nuclear properties of the parent and daughter nuclei , thus involving the calculation of nuclear matrix elements .",
    "its general expression is , see  @xcite for further details @xmath47 \\ , , \\label{shapef}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the electron and neutrino radial wave function indexes ( @xmath50 ) , @xmath51 represents the nuclear transition multipolarity ( @xmath52 ) and @xmath53 , @xmath54 are nuclear form factor functions , which are typically evaluated using n - body nuclear transition matrix elements in the impulse approximation .",
    "this represents the main source of uncertainty for @xmath35 .    on the other hand , ncb rate is strongly related to the corresponding beta decay process",
    ", whose rate is given by @xmath55 a simple relation holding between the beta decay and the ncb shape factors  @xcite @xmath56 though both variables have different kinematical domains in the two processes .",
    "the beta decay rate provides a relation expressing the mean shape factor , defined as @xmath57 in terms of observable quantities , @xmath44 and the half - life @xmath58 @xmath59 where @xmath60 is defined as @xmath61 we therefore obtain @xmath62 where the two factors @xmath46 and @xmath63 depend upon the same nuclear transition matrix elements .",
    "it is useful to define the quantity @xmath64 as @xmath65 and note that it contains the ratio of ncb and beta decay shape factors @xmath66 where a prime denotes all variables depending on @xmath67 which should be integrated over .",
    "the @xmath64 is a function of @xmath9 only , once the target nucleus characterized by @xmath11 and @xmath68 is given .",
    "the ncb cross section times neutrino velocity can then be conveniently written as @xmath69 with the product @xmath70 characterizing the various beta decay processes . values of @xmath71 are reported e.g. in  @xcite .",
    "as we will see , in some relevant cases the evaluation of @xmath72 is particularly simple so that eq .",
    "( [ sigma3 ] ) can be computed in an exact way . in all cases where this is not possible ,",
    "systematic uncertainties affecting the nuclear matrix element evaluation are expected to largely cancel in the shape factor ratio appearing in @xmath64 , and this suggests that the use of expression  ( [ sigma3 ] ) might be very useful to get a reliable estimate of the ncb cross section .",
    "beta decays in which the nucleus undergo a transition taking place between members of the same isospin multiplet are called superallowed . due to the large superposition between initial and final nuclear states these decays",
    "have the lowest known @xmath70 values .",
    "in particular , if the transition is of the @xmath73 type only the vector current contributes to the decay . in the limit of cvc hypothesis",
    "the vector form factor is given by the fermi matrix element and the shape factor can be written as @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the isospin quantum numbers .    in all other transitions happening inside the same isospin multiplet ( @xmath77 )",
    "both the vector and axial form factors contribute and in this case the shape factor can be written as @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the axial ( vector ) coupling constant . as first approximation",
    "both form factors can be evaluated using the initial and final state spin and isospin wavefunctions .",
    "however , a precise calculation requires the evaluation of higher order correction to nuclear matrix elements .",
    "we notice that for all superallowed decay the form factors do not depend on @xmath41 . in this case",
    "@xmath64 can be written as @xmath80 and we get for ncb processes @xmath81 which only depends on the half - life and the @xmath11 of the corresponding beta decay .    to illustrate the difference between expressions  ( [ sigma2 ] ) and  ( [ sigma3 ] ) we consider the specific case of tritium which decays to @xmath82 with @xmath83 kev  @xcite and an half - life of @xmath84 years  @xcite .",
    "we adopt @xmath85 and @xmath86 from  @xcite assuming a total 1.6% systematic uncertainty on the gamow - teller matrix element evaluation . using expression  ( [ sigma2 ] ) and",
    "( [ allowed ] ) with @xmath87 gev@xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90   and @xmath91 are strongly correlated . ]",
    "@xcite we find @xmath92 in case of massless neutrinos and in the limit of @xmath93 .",
    "we notice here that the main contribution to the quoted error is due to the uncertainty on the evaluation of the gamow - teller matrix element .",
    "this result is in agreement with previous calculations  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "evaluating @xmath94 using expression  ( [ xssup ] ) gives @xmath95 where the error is entirely due to the experimental uncertainties on @xmath11 and @xmath58 and the effect of matrix element uncertainty is now fully removed .",
    "the neutrino cross section for nuclei that undergo allowed beta decay can be evaluated only using a first order approximation since the beta decay shape factor is written in general as @xmath96 if only the leading terms are taken into account one gets the following approximation @xmath97 and from ( [ sigma2 ] ) one derives an order of magnitude estimate for the ncb interaction cross section .",
    "the effect of the higher order terms is however , not negligible and more precise estimates require nuclear matrix element evaluation for each specific transition . nevertheless , we expect that at a higher level of accuracy with respect to the leading approximation as above can be obtained using ( [ sigma3 ] ) and the fact that for the shape factor @xmath98 is reasonable to assume @xmath99 within this approximation @xmath64 is obtained using expression  ( [ super ] )",
    ".      neutrino cross section on nuclei that decay via k - unique forbidden beta decay takes a simple form since there is only one nuclear form factor involved in the shape factor .",
    "in particular , its expression can be written as @xmath100 where @xmath51 is the degree of forbiddeness of the decay , @xmath101 and @xmath102 and @xmath103 are respectively , numerical coefficients and functions that can be evaluated as in  @xcite . in particular , we can define the following functions @xmath104 for @xmath105-forbidden decays @xmath106 the corresponding shape factors are then given by @xmath107 ^ 2 \\left| ^{\\scriptscriptstyle a}f_{\\scriptscriptstyle ( i+1)\\ , i\\ , 1}^{\\scriptscriptstyle ( 0 ) } \\right|^2 u_i(p_e , p_\\nu ) \\ , .\\ ] ] since there are only even powers of the neutrino momentum @xmath31 these expressions are valid both for beta decay and ncb interaction .",
    "the quantity @xmath64 can be written using these expressions as @xmath108 and results to be independent of nuclear form factors .",
    "we have evaluated ncb cross section for several nuclei using parametrization of the fermi function and of the radial wave function coefficients @xmath103 in the shape factor as in @xcite and @xcite to account for finite nuclear size effect .",
    "two numerical programs have been used to evaluate numerically @xmath109 and @xmath103 , implemented with ` mathematica `  @xcite and c++ in a linux environment , using a high precision calculation of the gamma function  @xcite . in both cases",
    "the algorithms have been checked against each other and compared with the values reported in  @xcite in the range where these are available .",
    "a total accuracy of @xmath110 was achieved on @xmath40 and @xmath103 for values of @xmath68 up to @xmath111 , while for higher values of @xmath68 and at large values of electron ( positron ) energy ( @xmath112 mev ) the accuracy worsen to a few percent .",

    "we now consider a possible application of ncb to detection of the background of cosmological relic neutrinos .",

    "first of all , though as we stressed several times the ncb process is with no energy threshold , nevertheless , the ratio of ncb event number to corresponding beta decay events is typically very small . using ( [ sigma1 ] ) and ( [ sigma3 ] ) we find @xmath212 where we have used the fact that relic neutrinos have a very small mean momentum of order @xmath18 with a spread of the same order of magnitude , and the fact that the product of ncb cross section times neutrino velocity gets an asymptotic constant value for small neutrino energies , see figures [ fig : xsect_m ] and [ fig : xsect_p ] . in the case of @xmath23h",
    "we get @xmath213 a numerical estimate of the relative event rate of low energy neutrino ncb interaction with respect to beta decays can be obtained by using the results of figure  [ fig : aval ] in case of allowed and unique forbidden transitions .    despite of this disappointing result ,",
    "at least in principle the experimental signature of ncb events is unambiguous as the electron ( positron ) in the final state has a kinetic energy at least @xmath214 above the beta decay endpoint energy .",

    "this results in a remarkable increase of the expected event number for large neutrino mass and thus , for a fixed ratio @xmath249 , in a higher statistical significance due to the larger signal to ( beta decay ) background ratio .",

    "the detection of low energy neutrino backgrounds , primarily those emitted at the freeze out of weak interactions in the early stages of the evolution of the universe , is still beyond our present experimental capability .",
    "nevertheless , there is a continuous struggle both in the theoretical and experimental physics communities in searching for new ways and methods to detect these fleeting fluxes .    in this paper",
    "we have reported a careful analysis of neutrino capture on beta decaying nuclei .",
    "these processes have the remarkable property of having no energy threshold on the incoming neutrino energy and thus they might represent a good and numerous class of interactions suitable for low energy neutrino detection . this idea was already suggested several years ago by s. weinberg in @xcite , though in the framework of a degenerate massless relic neutrino background .",
    "our study has been inspired by this and prompted by the fact that we presently know that neutrinos are massive particles and might have masses @xmath10 as large as a fraction of ev .",
    "indeed , there is a gap of 2@xmath10 in the electron or positron energy spectrum separating the ( few ) events induced by e.g. relic neutrinos , from the large background of standard beta decays . at least in principle , this allows to disentangle the two processes . of course , any possibility to translate this idea into a real experimental technique depends upon two crucial issues , namely the expected order of magnitude of ncb event rate as well as the required energy resolution of the outgoing electron ( positron ) .",
    "the first issue has been considered in details in this paper .",
    "we have studied the low momentum limit of the ncb cross sections for more than two thousands beta decaying nuclei with a branching factor larger than 5@xmath250 .",
    "whenever possible , we have tried to reduce the effect of the uncertainty on the nuclear matrix elements by linking the ncb rate to the experimentally known properties of the corresponding beta decay , the half - life and the @xmath11 value .",
    "depending on the involved nuclear transition , the cross section times neutrino velocity in the low neutrino momentum regime spans several order of magnitude and interestingly , can be as large as @xmath251 @xmath1 @xmath2 for super - allowed decays .",
    "this means that the event rate can be remarkably large .",
    "for example , we found that with 100 g of @xmath23h one expects order 10 events per year due to scattering of cosmological relic neutrinos .",
    "similar rates are also found for many super - allowed transitions .",
    "interestingly , the event rate is expected to be even larger for neutrino masses of 0.3 @xmath242 0.7 ev due to the effect of gravitational clustering in the neighborhood of the earth . in this case",
    "the expected signal rate is in the range 20@xmath242150 per year per 100 g of @xmath23h .",
    "the second problem is the possibility to have a reasonable rejection of the background due to standard beta decay electrons / positrons .",
    "this depends on the incoming neutrino energy range which is under study and the experimental energy resolution . in the most demanding case of the extremely low momentum cosmological relic neutrinos ,",
    "it is necessary to reach a sensitivity which is better than the value of neutrino mass .",
    "this can be foreseen as a plausible perspective for future experiments only if neutrinos have masses of order ev , thus in the so called degenerate scheme for neutrino masses , which is still allowed by all present data , though slightly disfavored by cosmological observations .",
    "for example , for @xmath252 ev and an energy resolution of @xmath253 ev a reasonable event to background discrimination is possible . for smaller neutrino masses",
    "it seems very hard if not impossible at all to use ncb processes for relic neutrinos .",
    "of course , further improvements of the background rejection could be achieved by a careful and more complete reconstruction of the kinematics of the observed events , including possibly the daughter nucleus recoil energy . as a further example , for polarized nuclei one could also measure the beta - gamma angular correlation in case the daughter nuclei de - excite via gamma emission . however , these detailed issues are beyond the aim of the present paper and might deserve further insights depending on forthcoming information about the absolute neutrino mass scale .",
