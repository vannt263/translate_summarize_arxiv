    "the icecube neutrino observatory is a neutrino telescope designed to detect high energy astrophysical neutrinos with energies @xmath0  gev .",
    "such an observation could reveal the origins of cosmic rays ( cr ) and the possible connection to shock acceleration in supernova remnants ( snr ) , active galactic nuclei ( agn ) or gamma ray bursts ( grb ) .",
    "an advantage of neutrino astronomy over other experimental observations such as gamma ray astronomy is the possibility to offer insight about the most energetic and dense parts of the universe since neutrinos are weakly interactive particles that can travel through matter without interacting .",
    "nonetheless , this advantage also makes the neutrino detection a technological challenge since a large amount of volume is required to observe neutrino interactions .",
    "the icecube neutrino observatory uses the antarctic ice as a detection volume where a neutrino interaction will produce a muon ( or other charged lepton ) as a result of the charged current interaction .",
    "deep antarctic ice is also transparent which allows the induced cherenkov light by the muon to propagate . in order to detect this cherenkov light",
    ", icecube will instrument a cubic kilometer of clear antarctic ice sheet underneath the geographic south pole with an array of 5,160 digital optical modules ( doms ) deployed on 86 strings from 1.45 - 2.45 km deep .",
    "the doms are spherical , pressure resistant glass housing , each containing a 25 cm diameter hamamatsu photomultiplier tube and the electronics for waveform digitization .",
    "the icecube configuration also includes a denser array with 6 strings equipped with higher quantum efficiency doms , the so called deepcore detector , in order to increase the sensitivity to low energy neutrinos ( @xmath1  100  gev ) .",
    "a surface array for observing extensive air showers of cosmic rays is also being installed ( icetop ) .",
    "icecube construction started with a first string installed in the 2005 - 6 season ( achterberg et al .",
    "2006 ) and will be completed in the austral summer of 2010 - 11 .    in this paper",
    "we describe the point source analysis of the data corresponding to the year 2008 - 9 when icecube configuration consisted in 40 deployed strings .",
    "the icecube 40-string configuration performance as well as the event selection criteria followed in the analysis are described in section  [ sec : performance ] .",
    "section  [ sec : method ] explains the methodology used for the search of point neutrino sources and stacking analysis .",
    "the search strategies applied to the icecube data and their results are discussed in section  [ sec : searches ] .",
    "conclusions are shown in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "as mentioned before , forty strings of icecube were operational from april 2008 to may 2009 with @xmath2 duty cycle after a run selection based on the stability of the detector .",
    "the number of trigger events of the icecube detector for the 40-string configuration livetime was of the order of @xmath3 events . among these events ,",
    "99.99999@xmath4 are muons produced by the impact of primary cosmic rays with the atmospheric nuclei .",
    "this number of triggered events can be reduced to @xmath5 events using an online filtering system based on the quality of the track reconstructions and energy estimators .",
    "the total livetime of the 40-string configuration was 375.5 days , leading to final atmospheric neutrino rate of 40 atmospheric neutrinos per day , which comprises the irreducible background of a point source analysis .",
    "the detection principle of neutrino telescopes normally uses the earth as a shield for up - going atmospheric muon tracks . by",
    "selecting only reconstructed up - going tracks we can reject part of these atmospheric muons . however",
    "due to the huge amount of down - going atmospheric muons reaching the detector , even a small fraction of mis - reconstructed events can contaminate the up - going sample .",
    "for that reason tight cuts in the quality of the track reconstruction and track - like parameters such as the reduced likelihood of the track fit and the directional width of the likelihood space around the best track fit are applied .",
    "also a cut in the likelihood ratio between the best up - going and down - going track solution is applied together with a requirement that the event s set of hits can be split into two parts which both reconstruct as nearly up - going .",
    "these cuts in the up - going region ( northern sky from icecube location ) define a final data sample with sensitivity to point sources optimized for sources of neutrinos in the tev - pev energy range .    with the 40-string configuration",
    "we also extended the point source analysis to directions above the horizon in the down - going region of the sky ( southern sky from the icecube location ) .",
    "this extension of the point source analysis is possible by rejecting five orders of magnitude of atmospheric muon background events by applying cuts in the energy estimator in order to discriminate the large amount of these atmospheric muons from a possible neutrino signal with a harder spectrum .",
    "after track - quality selections , similar but tighter than for the up - going sample , a cut based on an energy estimator is made until a fixed number of events per steradians is achieved .",
    "because only the highest energy events pass the selection , sensitivity in part of the sky is primarily to neutrino sources at pev energies and above .",
    "both the angular resolution and effective area of the detector depend on the event selection .",
    "since the two samples ( up - going and down - going events ) are defined by different quality cuts , the detector performance is different for both parts of the sky .",
    "figure  [ fig : psf ] shows the neutrino point spread function of the icecube 40-string configuration for up - going events compared to the past 22-string configuration and the final icecube detector .",
    "the angular resolution , defined as the median of the point spread function , is shown in figure  [ fig : resol ] for both the up - going and down - going region for the final icecube 40-string sample .",
    "after the event selection described in the previous section , the final data sample consists of 36900 events where approximately one third are up - going events and two thirds down - going events .",
    "the final sample of a point source analysis consists of a set of arrival directions and energy estimators .",
    "figure  [ fig : eventmap ] shows how the final arrival directions are distributed on the whole sky .",
    "the aim of a point source analysis is to identify an anisotropy on these arrival directions by looking for an accumulation of events in a given direction which will indicate the presence of an astrophysical point source emitting neutrinos . in order to perform such an analysis in icecube we use an unbinned likelihood method ( braun et al .",
    "this method has substantial improvements with respect to the standard binned analysis .",
    "the method accounts for individual reconstructed events uncertainties and energy estimators and compares the random distributions of atmospheric neutrino background for the northern sky and atmospheric muon background for the southern sky to that produced by a signal coming from a point neutrino source .",
    "the method models the data as a two component mixture of signal and background .",
    "a maximum likelihood fit is applied to determine the relative contribution of each component",
    ". given @xmath6 events in the final sample the density distribution of the @xmath7 event is given by    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the probability density distribution for the signal hypothesis and @xmath10 for background .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 is the number of signal events and is one of the free parameters of the likelihood maximization together with the spectral index , @xmath12 , of the signal spectrum distribution .    for each tested direction in the sky , the best fit according to the likelihood maximization",
    "is found yielding the best estimate of @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the logarithm of the likelihood ratio between the best - fit hypothesis , @xmath15 , and the null hypothesis of only background , @xmath16 is the test statistic of the method .",
    "the significance of the result is evaluated by comparing the test statistic with a distribution obtained by performing the same analysis over a sample of only - background data sets .",
    "these only - background datasets are obtained by scrambling real data in right ascension .",
    "the earth rotation guarantees the uniform exposure in right ascension and uniform background per declination band , hence we can randomize the events in right ascension while keeping all other event properties fixed .",
    "nearly vertical events are excluded from the randomization since polar regions in the sky can not be scrambled in right ascension .    in all - sky analyses the whole sky",
    "is scanned in steps of @xmath17 forming a grid with bin size much finer than the angular resolution .",
    "the hottest spot in the grid is considered to be the point with the highest significance .",
    "the final significance is determined by the fraction of scrambled data sets containing at least one grid point with a log likelihood ratio higher than the one observed in the data .",
    "this fraction is the _ post - trial _",
    "p - value for the all - sky search .",
    "a significant penalty is paid in the all - sky search due to the number of effective trials due to scanning the entire sky .",
    "therefore an additional search usually performed in point source analysis is to select a number of locations _ a priori _ based on candidate sources .",
    "the likelihood is maximized on each of these locations instead of over the entire sky reducing the number of trials . the most significant result from this candidate source list is also compared to the distribution of randomized scrambled data yielding the final _ post - trial _",
    "p - value .    a third method of stacking analysis is also presented in this paper where instead of considering individual sources the cumulative signal from a collection of similar sources is considered .",
    "the stacking analysis is a well - known technique in astronomy that has been already applied to neutrino astronomy ( abbasi et al .",
    "stacking multiple sources is an effective way to enhance the discovery potential of similar sources when the source fluxes are too faint to yield a discovery individually . by considering the cumulative signal for all sources emitting together",
    ", we can increase our discovery potential and set upper limits on interesting catalogs of neutrino source candidates as a whole .",
    "the stacking analysis requires a small modification to the unbinned likelihood analysis .",
    "the signal density distribution , @xmath9 , from equation  [ eq : pdf ] now refers to the sum of individual sources . assuming that @xmath18 is the number of sources to stack , the signal density distribution can be rewritten as follows    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is a relative theoretical weight of the @xmath21 source in the catalog and @xmath22 is the relative detector acceptance for a source with spectral index @xmath12 .",
    "as in the all - sky search and the fixed source search , the only two free parameters in the likelihood maximization are the signal contribution , @xmath11 , and the spectral index , @xmath12 . the weights , @xmath20 are correlated with the theoretical expected neutrino luminosity from that given source based on gamma observations , a uniform model will assume all @xmath23 .",
    "the detector acceptance , @xmath22 , is tabulated using simulation .",
    "in the previous two sections we discussed the methodology followed in the point source analysis . with the method described we performed five different searches using the data of the icecube 40-string configuration :    * an all - sky search using the standard point source analysis . * a dedicated search based on a list of candidate sources to reduce the penalty from the number of trials . * a stacking search using the tev source list from milagro as a catalog . * a stacking search using a catalog of nearby clusters of galaxies . * a stacking search using a catalog of stardust galaxies .",
    "the first search is a scan looking for the most significant point in the whole sky .",
    "as mentioned before , with the 40-string configuration the search was extended to the southern sky therefore covering declinations from @xmath24 to @xmath25 .",
    "figure  [ fig : skymap ] shows the significance skymap for the all - sky search . the most significant deviation from the only background hypothesis",
    "is located at coordinates 113.75@xmath26 r.a .",
    ", 15.15@xmath26 dec .",
    "the _ pre - trial _ estimated p - value of the maximum log likelihood ratio at this location is @xmath27 equivalent to a single sided sigma of 4.5 .",
    "1817 out of 10,000 scrambled data sets have an equal or higher significance somewhere in the sky resulting in the _ post - trial _",
    "p - value of 18% well compatible with a background fluctuation .",
