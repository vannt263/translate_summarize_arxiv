    "when the customers are better equipped , optimal quality emerges @xcite .",

    "economics literature has approached this problem mainly with the help of utility functions .",

    "we take the point of view of a monopolistic vendor faced to consumers deciding to buy one of his products according to their perception of its quality .",
    "the resulting complex complex system with one vendor , several product variants , and many heterogeneous buyers , is investigated by numerical techniques .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : one_var ] we introduce our framework and determine the optimal quality of a  single product proposed to homogeneous or heterogeneous customers . in section  [ sec : multiple ] we examine the conditions under which a vendor should segment the market by manufacturing several products of different quality . in section  [ sec : price ]",

    "obviously , such an optimal solution is pathological .",
