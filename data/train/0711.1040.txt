    "open quantum systems often exhibit the phenomenon of resonances .",
    "resonances correspond to quasi - stationary states which have a long life - time but eventually decay into the continuum .",
    "( a particle , initially within the system , escapes to infinity . )",
    "one approach to the problem of resonances is based on the study of the analytic properties of the scattering matrix , @xmath0 , in the complex energy plane .",
    "resonances correspond to the poles , @xmath1 , of @xmath0 on the unphysical sheet @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach amounts to solving the stationary schrdinger equation , with the boundary condition of an outgoing wave only .",
    "this condition , which makes the problem non - hermitian , describes a particle ejected from the system .",
    "the schrdinger equation with such boundary condition admits complex eigenvalues @xmath2 , which correspond to the resonances @xcite .",
    "this kind of approach leads in a natural way to a non - hermitian effective hamiltonian , and it has been used for a long time in scattering theory , including scattering in chaotic and disordered systems ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "there are many examples of resonances in atomic and nuclear physics .",
    "more recently , there has been much interest in resonant phenomena in the field of chaotic and disordered systems ( for a recent review see @xcite ) .",
    "there is considerable amount of work concerning the distribution @xmath3 of resonance widths in one - dimensional disordered chains @xcite .",
    "numerical studies presented in that work demonstrate that , in a broad range of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , with the exponent @xmath6 being close to 1 .",
    "( a similar behavior pertains also to two- and three - dimensional systems with localized states @xcite ) .",
    "an analytical calculation @xcite has been performed for a one - dimensional continuous ( white - noise ) potential , in the semiclassical limit , when the localization length is large .",
    "it has been shown in that work that in a broad range of @xmath4 , @xmath3 is well fitted by a function @xmath7 . for sufficiently small @xmath4 ,",
    "however , @xmath8-behavior was obtained , followed by a sharp cutoff at still smaller @xmath4 , due to the finite size of the sample .",
    "a different analytical approach was recently developed in @xcite , for a discrete tight - binding random chain .",
    "the limit of strong disorder ( i.e. , opposite to that of ref .",
    "@xcite ) was considered and the @xmath8-behavior ( for a semi - infinite chain ) was derived .    in the present paper",
    "we develop a new approach to the problem of resonances .",
    "the approach is based on counting the number of poles of a resolvent of the corresponding non - hermitian hamiltonian .",
    "we derive a set of equations for a semi - infinite disordered chain , coupled to a ( semi - infinite ) lead .",
    "this set contains , in principal , the full solution of the problem , for an arbitrary coupling strength and disorder .",
    "the equations simplify considerably in the weak coupling regime .",
    "for this case we rigorously derive the asymptotically exact @xmath8-rule and present a simple scaling formula , which contains only the product of the localization length and the density of states , at the relevant energy .",
    "the system is depicted in fig.1 .",
    "black dots , labelled by @xmath9 , designate sites along the semi - infinite disordered chain .",
    "each site of the chain is assigned a site energy , @xmath10 .",
    "different @xmath10 s ( @xmath9 ) are independent random variables chosen from some distribution @xmath11 .",
    "open circles , labeled by @xmath12 represent a perfect semi- infinite lead to which the chain is coupled .",
    "all sites of the lead are assigned @xmath13 .",
    "the lead simulates the free space outside the chain .",
    "all nearest neighbor sites of the chain are coupled to each other by a hopping amplitude @xmath14 , and the same is true for all nearest neighbor sites of the lead . the only exception to",
    "this rule is the pair ( 0,1 ) which provides coupling between the chain and the lead .",
    "the hopping amplitude for this pair is taken to be equal @xmath15 .",
    "this allows us to tune the coupling from @xmath16 ( closed chain ) to @xmath17 ( fully coupled chain ) .",
    "as was mentioned in the introduction , the most direct approach to the problem of resonances is based on solving the stationary schrdinger equation with the boundary condition of an _ outgoing wave _ ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the schrdinger equation for the entire system ( chain + lead ) is a set of coupled equations : @xmath18 we recall that @xmath19 for @xmath20 ( the lead ) and it is random for @xmath21 ( the chain ) .",
    "eqs.(1 - 4 ) are to be solved subjected to the boundary condition of a outgoing wave in the lead , i.e. @xmath22 , for @xmath23 , with @xmath24 .",
    "the complex wave vector @xmath25 is related to @xmath26 by @xmath27 . using the plane wave shape of the outgoing wave in the lead , it is straightforward to eliminate from eqs.(1 - 4 ) all @xmath28 s with @xmath20 , thus reducing the problem to a system of equations for the amplitudes @xmath28 on the sites of the disordered chain alone ( @xmath9 ) : @xmath29 with the condition @xmath30 . here",
    "@xmath31 for @xmath32 , but not for @xmath33 .",
    "this end site is assigned a complex energy @xmath34 where the parameter @xmath35 describes the coupling strength to the outside world .",
    "thus , the resonances are given by the complex eigenvalues of the non - hermitian effective hamiltonian defined in ( [ nhschrod1d ] ) .",
    "this non - hermitian hamiltonian , @xmath36 , differs from the hermitian hamiltonian , @xmath37 , of the corresponding closed system ( i.e. , with @xmath38 ) only by the complex correction to the energy of the first site ( eq.([epsilon ] ) ) : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the projection on site 1 .",
    "we set the energy scale by taking @xmath41 and denote by @xmath42 the complex variable @xmath43 .",
    "note that , since @xmath44 is related to @xmath42 via @xmath45 , the effective hamiltonian @xmath36 depends on @xmath42 .",
    "thus , eq . ( [ nhschrod1d ] )",
    "does not constitute a standard eigenvalue problem and the eigenvalues of @xmath36 have to be determined self - consistently .",
    "defining formally the resolvent @xmath46 we can write @xmath47^{-1}=   { 1\\over 1+\\eta e^ { i\\tilde k } gp}g    , \\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the `` unperturbed '' resolvent .",
    "resonances correspond to the singularities of the matrix @xmath49 , in the complex @xmath42-plane , or to the roots of the equation @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the @xmath52-element of @xmath53 in the site representation .",
    "let us write @xmath51 as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the self - energy for site @xmath56 . eq.([roots ] ) can be written as @xmath57 denoting the zeroes of @xmath58 by @xmath59 , we write the density of resonances ( dor ) , for a given realization of the disorder , as @xmath60 .",
    "this expression refers directly to the semi - infinite chain and it should be understood as the @xmath61 limit of the analogous expression for a finite chain , of size @xmath62 . the limit is well defined for any @xmath63 and no division of the sum by @xmath62 is necessary @xcite , in contrast to the usual case of the density of states ( on the real axis ) for a hermitian problem .",
    "it is convenient to define a @xmath64-function of a complex variable @xmath65 as @xmath66 and to use the relation @xmath67 where the prime indicates a derivative with respect to @xmath42 .",
    "this relation is a generalization of the corresponding relation for a real variable .",
    "it is valid if @xmath58 is analytic in a domain containing the zeroes @xmath59 and @xmath68 .",
    "indeed , under such conditions in the neighborhood of a zero , the equation @xmath69 can be solved by an analytic function @xmath70 and the jacobian of the change of variables from @xmath71 to @xmath72 is @xmath73 due to the cauchy - riemann equations .",
    "we will assume that @xmath74 with probability one .",
    "substituting eq.([f ] ) for @xmath58 , we have @xmath75 where @xmath76 stands for the expression @xmath77 .    next we average eq.([rho ] ) over all realizations of the set @xmath78 of the random site energies ( we denote this average by angular brackets ) . since the self - energy @xmath55 does not depend on the energy @xmath79 of the first site , we can single out the variable @xmath79 and average over it explicitly .",
    "this leads to the following expression for the average dor : @xmath80\\delta(z-\\epsilon - s_1+\\eta\\lambda)>,\\ ] ] the two correlated random variables , @xmath81 and @xmath82 depend on the set @xmath83 of the random site energies .",
    "note that we do not need to know the joint probability distribution for @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "indeed , only three special combinations of these two variables appear in eq.([rho1 ] ) .",
    "it is therefore useful to introduce three functions @xmath84 and write ( [ rho1 ] ) as @xmath85.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we emphasize that @xmath81 refers to a closed ( semi - infinite ) chain , so that one can use the standard relations for various quantities of the hermitian problem @xcite . in particular",
    ", we ll need the relation @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the self energy for site 2 , with site 1 excluded .",
    "it immediately follows that @xmath88    with the help of the definitions ( 15)-(17 ) and the recursion relations ( 19 ) , ( 20 ) it is straightforward to derive integral relations between the functions @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "for instance , using ( 20 ) , @xmath92 can be rewritten as @xmath93 the variable @xmath94 is now `` isolated '' ( i.e. , all other quantities in ( [ h1 ] ) do not depend on this variable ) and can be averaged over .",
    "this leads to @xmath95.\\ ] ] the two other equations can be derived in a similar way , yielding : @xmath96\\ ] ] and @xmath97 let us stress that the above defined functions of the complex argument @xmath98 are not complex valued functions in the usual sense but rather shorthand notations for a function of two real variables , @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "for instance , eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) for the function @xmath101 , which is the probability distribution for the real and imaginary part of the self - energy @xmath102 , can be written more explicitly as @xmath103    the three equations , ( 22)-(24 ) , supplemented by the expression ( 18 ) provide the general framework for computing the average dor , @xmath104 , in the complex plane @xmath105 , for any strength of disorder and for an arbitrary coupling @xmath106 .",
    "we do not attempt to solve the problem in its full generality but rather restrict ourselves to the small @xmath106 , i.e. weak coupling case .",
    "from now on we assume that the coupling constant @xmath106 is small and develop a `` linear response theory '' with respect to @xmath106 . in this limit",
    "the width of all resonances becomes proportional to @xmath106 , so that the `` cloud '' of resonances in the @xmath107-plane gets squeezed towards the real axes . in order to define a meaningful @xmath108 limit for the dor",
    ", one must stretch the @xmath109-axis by a factor of @xmath110 .",
    "it is natural to switch from the original variable @xmath105 to a new variable , @xmath111 , where @xmath112 and @xmath113 , where the minus sign accounts for the fact that the resonances are located in the lower half plane of the complex variable @xmath42 .",
    "thus , in the @xmath114-plane resonances appear in the upper half - plane and @xmath115 is the resonance width , in units of @xmath106 .",
    "the limiting ( i.e. , in the @xmath116 limit ) average dor , @xmath117 , in the complex @xmath114-plane is related to the original dor , @xmath118 , as : @xmath119    next , we turn our attention to the functions @xmath120 and @xmath91 in the @xmath108 limit .",
    "the function @xmath121 is the probability distribution for the real and imaginary part of the self - energy @xmath81 .",
    "the shape of this function depends on the point @xmath105 . in the @xmath108 limit ,",
    "as has been just explained , one should set @xmath122 , where @xmath115 does not depend on @xmath106 .",
    "furthermore , since the imaginary part of @xmath81 is proportional to @xmath106 , we set @xmath123 . the distribution , @xmath124 , for the new variables ( @xmath125 is related to the distribution @xmath121 for the `` old '' variables by @xmath126 .",
    "the distribution @xmath124 has a well defined @xmath108 limit and it satisfies an integral equation , obtained from ( [ f1 ] ) by transforming to the new variables and taking the @xmath127 limit : @xmath128    the simplifying feature of the @xmath108 limit is that functions @xmath90 and @xmath91 are easily expressible in terms of @xmath89 .",
    "more precisely , we have to define functions @xmath53 and @xmath37 , of the new variables : @xmath129 these functions , in complete analogy with @xmath124 , have a well defined @xmath108 limit and satisfy integral relations which are derived from ( [ h2 ] ) , ( [ g ] ) by writing them in explicit form ( compare to ( [ f1 ] ) ) , transforming to the new variables and taking the @xmath108 limit .",
    "this yields : @xmath130,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath131.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one can easily check that ( 29 ) and ( 30 ) are satisfied by @xmath132 now we can derive an expression for @xmath117 @xmath133 , in terms of the function @xmath65 , by taking the @xmath108 limit in eq.(18 ) and using ( [ dor ] ) and ( [ gh ] ) : @xmath134 note that , since @xmath135 , in the @xmath108 limit @xmath136 approaches @xmath137 which is related to @xmath138 by @xmath139",
    ". therefore @xmath140 in ( [ rho3 ] ) is given by @xmath141 it is convenient to define a new variable , @xmath142 , so that @xmath143 is the imaginary part of self - energy ( the resonance width ) in units of @xmath144 .",
    "finally , we denote @xmath145 by @xmath146 ( the real part of the self - energy ) and define the probability distribution @xmath147 , instead of @xmath124 .",
    "@xmath147 satisfies the integral equation @xmath148 where the integration variable @xmath149 was replaced by @xmath150 . the expression ( [ rho3 ] ) for the average dor now reads : @xmath151 while performing integration in equations ( [ f2 ] ) , ( [ rho4 ] ) , one should keep in mind that the function @xmath147 is identically zero for @xmath152 .",
    "this property follows from the basic recursion relation for the self energy @xmath153 .",
    "the integral equation ( [ f2 ] ) , supplemented by the expression ( [ rho4 ] ) , completely defines the problem of resonances in the weak coupling limit .",
    "note that the coupling strength , @xmath106 , does not appear explicitly in these equations .",
    "it only determines the units in which the resonance width is measured ( the widths of all resonances is proportional to @xmath106 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath117 is determined solely by the properties of the closed system and , in this sense , eqs.([f2 ] ) , ( [ rho4 ] ) describe the regime of linear response with respect to the coupling strength @xmath106 .",
    "the function @xmath147 describes the joint probability distribution for the real and imaginary part of the self - energy ( of the closed system and for @xmath42 approaches the real axis ) and the integral equation ( [ f2 ] ) has appeared previously in the study of anderson localization @xcite .",
    "integration of ( [ f2 ] ) over @xmath143 yields the integral equation for the probability distribution , @xmath154 , of the real part of the self - energy : @xmath155 this equation is very useful in the theory of one - dimensional localization @xcite , because the knowledge of @xmath154 allows one to compute the localization length , @xmath156 , according to : @xmath157 we shall use this relation in the next section .",
    "we were not able to obtain the complete analytic solution of the integral equation ( [ f2 ] ) .",
    "it is possible , however , to find the large-@xmath143 asymptotics of the function @xmath147 .",
    "we state the result and give the proof later : to leading order in the small quantity , @xmath158 , @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the usual density of states , on the real energy axis , for the closed chain .",
    "an important feature of this result is that the large-@xmath143 asymptotics does not contain @xmath146 .",
    "therefore , by plugging in ( [ large j ] ) into ( [ rho4 ] ) we immediately obtain the simple result for the small-@xmath115 asymptotic of the average dor : @xmath161 note that the factors containing @xmath162 had cancelled , so that @xmath138 enters only via the density of states and the localization length .",
    "this cancellation is the consequence of the obvious scaling property of the general equation ( [ rho4 ] ) , namely : the dependence on @xmath163 drops out if one transforms to a new variable , @xmath164 , and to a new function , @xmath165 .",
    "thus , the asymptotic ( @xmath166)- behavior is universal , in the sense that it holds for any degree of disorder and for any @xmath167 .",
    "it remains to prove the result stated in ( [ large j ] ) .",
    "it is convenient to define the function @xmath168 and to study its large-@xmath143 asymptotics .",
    "an integral equation for @xmath169 is derived by integrating ( [ f2 ] ) over the second argument of @xmath40 . while performing this integration one should remember that the function @xmath170 is identically zero for @xmath171 .",
    "it follows from this property that for @xmath172 @xmath173 combining both cases , i.e. , @xmath172 and @xmath174 , one obtains the following integral equation : @xmath175    we are interested in the large-@xmath143 behavior of @xmath169 .",
    "it is useful to define the laplace transform @xmath176 and to study its small-@xmath177 behavior .",
    "the integral equation for the transform is obtained directly from ( [ w2 ] ) :    @xmath178    where @xmath179 anticipating that @xmath169 is proportional to @xmath158 , we look for the solution ( in the small @xmath177 limit ) of ( [ w4 ] ) in the form @xmath180 this ansatz satisfies eq.([w4 ] ) if @xmath181 and @xmath182 with @xmath183 since the site energy distribution , @xmath11 , is normalized to 1 , it immediately follows from ( [ w7 ] ) that @xmath184 is a constant . we denote this constant by @xmath185 and determine it as follows .",
    "define a function @xmath186 which is the non - trivial solution of the integral equation @xmath187 note that the kernel @xmath188 is not symmetric with respect to @xmath146 and @xmath189 and that equation ( [ w10 ] ) , unlike ( [ w7 ] ) , is not solved by a constant .",
    "the solution of ( [ w10 ] ) is : @xmath190 we now go back to ( [ w8 ] ) , multiply it by @xmath191 , integrate over @xmath146 and , with the help of ( [ w10 ] ) , obtain : @xmath192 which , using ( [ w9 ] ) and the aforementioned result @xmath193 , yields the value of @xmath194 : @xmath195 where the explicit form of @xmath191 ( see ( [ w11 ] ) ) has been used at the last step .",
    "the integral in the numerator is known in localization theory @xcite and is equal to the density of states @xmath160 .",
    "the integral in the denominator is equal to @xmath196)(see ( [ f3 ] ) ) .",
    "thus , in the small-@xmath177 limit , @xmath197 , with @xmath198 . as a consequence , in the large-@xmath143 limit , @xmath199 and @xmath200 which completes the proof of ( [ large j ] ) .",
    "one can also show that ( [ w8 ] ) has a unique solution @xmath201 and the behavior of @xmath202 suggests that @xmath203 and @xmath204",
    "we studied the average density of resonances ( dor ) for a semi - infinite disordered chain , coupled to the outside world by a ( semi - infinite ) perfect lead .",
    "the main result of this work is the expression ( 18 ) for the average dor , supplemented by the three integral equations , ( 22 - 24 ) , for the three functions , @xmath205 and @xmath89 .",
    "this set of equations provide the general framework for calculating the average dor , for an arbitrary disorder and coupling strength .",
    "we applied these general equations to the case of weak coupling and derived an asymptotically exact expression for the average dor , in the limit of small resonance width ( eq.(39 ) ) .",
    "this expression is universal , in the sense that it holds for any degree of disorder and everywhere in the ( unperturbed ) energy band .",
    "it is worthwhile to emphasize the essential difference between the average dor , as defined in this paper , and the probability distribution of the resonance widths , often used in the literature ( e.g.@xcite ) . for a finite size chain , of @xmath62 sites ,",
    "the two quantities differ only by a factor @xmath62 . however , when @xmath62 approaches @xmath206 , the probability distribution shrinks towards a delta - function , while the average dor approaches a perfectly well defined limit .",
    "since we have taken a semi - infinite chain from the start , it was essential for us to work with the average dor , rather than with the probability distribution of the resonant widths .",
    "this enabled us to obtain the @xmath166-behavior in the @xmath207 limit , in contrast to the statement of @xcite that in that limit the @xmath166-behavior has no region of applicability .",
