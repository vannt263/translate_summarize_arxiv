    "it has to be mentioned that the monte - carlo method has been utilized successfully in the studies of membranes and vesicles @xcite . for the monte - carlo method , however , tethered ( polymerized ) membrane rather than fluid membrane",
    "is more suited @xcite , because membrane is implemented in computer as an assembly of molecules and junctions bearing close resemblance to tethered membrane . however , gompper and kroll succeeded in simulating fluid membranes by monte - carlo method , allowing reconstructions of junctions during simulation ( dynamical triangulation ) @xcite .",
    "they succeeded in observing the variation of topological index with respect to the change of membrane concentration and temperature . in fairness",

    "we explain our transfer - matrix formalism for a fluid membrane .",
    "we also explicate the density - matrix renormalization group with which we diagonalized the transfer matrix . in section [ section3 ]",
    ", we calculate the effective bending rigidity . for that purpose",
    ", we introduce a scheme of coarse - graining .",
    "our data clearly support membrane stiffening under the choice of mean curvature @xmath20 as a statistical measure . for other measures , on the contrary , we observed tendency toward softening . in the last section , we present summary and discussions",
    "in this section , we present our numerical simulation technique .",
    "first , we explain our transfer - matrix formalism .",
    "secondly , we introduce the density - matrix renormalization group with which we diagonalize the transfer matrix .",
    "demonstration of the algorithm is also presented .      in order to describe the shape of membranes , it is convenient to use the monge gauge @xcite . in this frame ,",
    "membrane deformation is described by a normal displacement ( deformation ) @xmath16 from a base ( reference ) plane parameterized by cartesian coordinates @xmath21 . in terms of this representation frame , the mean curvature @xmath20",
    "is given by , @xmath22 explicitly .",
    "similarly , the infinitesimal area @xmath23 is given by , @xmath24 putting all together into the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , we obtain an explicit expression in term of the displacement field @xmath16 .",
    "now , we are led to a two - dimensional scalar - field theory @xmath16 .",
    "however , the theory is afflicted by very complicated interactions .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate the theory beyond perturbative level by means of an _ ab initio _ method : for that purpose , we put the theory on a square lattice with lattice constant @xmath25 ; see fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "accordingly , the field variables @xmath26 are now indexed by integer indices @xmath27 and @xmath28 . throughout this paper",
    ", we set the lattice constant as the unit of length @xmath29 .",
    "in other words , we are considering a square - netted membrane which was brought into thorough discussion in ref .",
    "readers may find convincing arguments why @xmath20 is a physically sensible statistical measure .",
    "in particular , the authors think of a polymer chain , whose natural statistical measure is the angles between adjacent links .",
    "likewise , for a fluid membrane , they found that the curvatures are the right statistical measure , continuing the polymer into a new space dimension to build up a membrane .",
    "our theory has the translational invariance of @xmath30 , and thus , the absolute value of @xmath31 should be meaningless .",
    "therefore , we introduce the link variable , @xmath32 denoting the `` step '' at each link ; see fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "obviously , we are just performing the well - known duality transformation @xcite , which is very successful in the study of random surfaces .",
    "note that now , we arrive at a dual model with step variables @xmath33 ; see fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] . for this dual model ,",
    "the bending - energy cost exists at each plaquette , because it was originally a vertex possessing a curvature spanned by adjacent links .",
    "hence , the statistical weight is associated at each plaquette ; @xmath34 with , @xmath35 see also fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] for the notation of @xmath36 .",
    "we have set @xmath37 , because @xmath38 can be absorbed into the bending rigidity @xmath5 .",
    "it is apparent from the construction of the dual theory that the step variables are not fully independent . in the notation of fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] , there exists a restriction of @xmath39 for each open plaquette .",
    "therefore , we introduce the following statistical weight for each of them ; @xmath40    as a consequence , we reach the lattice field theory with the statistical weights @xmath41 ( [ statistical_weight_1 ] ) and @xmath42 ( [ statistical_weight_2 ] ) , which are arranged in the checker - board pattern . likewise , the transfer matrix is constructed as a strip - like segment shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "the transfer matrix is diagonalized by the density - matrix renormalization group .",
    "we will explain it in the next subsection .    in order to implement the above theory to computer simulation",
    ", we must carry out yet another simplification .",
    "namely , we discretize the link variable as follows ; @xmath43 with @xmath44",
    ". the unit of step @xmath45 is determined selfconsistently through the simulation ; @xmath46 where @xmath47 denotes the thermal average .",
    "we made several trials for the tuning parameters of @xmath48 and @xmath49 ; this discretization is the most influential factor concerning the reliability of our simulation .",
    "we will explore the reliability in the next subsection .",
    "our theory resembles the so - called solid - on - solid model , which exhibits kosterlitz - thouless critical phase .",
    "note that in our model , there is no surface - tension term , and there exists the bending elasticity @xmath5 instead .",
    "therefore , our theory is not right at critical phase , but it is rather driven off from it .",
    "the renormalization - group flow is actually the central concern of the present paper , and it is explored in the next section .    in the above , we did not pay any attention to the measure factor for the partition sum .",
    "as is emphasized in introduction , the measure factor should alter the underlying physics even qualitatively . as is apparent from the above formalism , particularly from eq .",
    "( [ step_discretization ] ) , we accept uniform measure for the step variable ; namely , we are accepting the normal displacement as the statistical measure .",
    "following the idea advocated in refs .",
    "@xcite , we will also consider the local mean curvature as for the statistical measure .",
    "the replacement of the integration variables is absorbed into the redefinition of the statistical weight .",
    "namely , we made the replacement , @xmath50 the square root is intended to take geometrical mean , because each step variable @xmath51 is sheared by an adjacent plaquette as well .",
    "in addition , we consider the local tilt angle as for the measure ; namely , we made the replacement , @xmath52 as a consequence , we have prepared three types of statistical weights , @xmath53 ( [ statistical_weight_1 ] ) , @xmath1 ( [ statistical_weight_3 ] ) and @xmath54 ( [ statistical_weight_4 ] ) , which are examined in the next section .      in the previous section ,",
    "we have set up the transfer matrix . in principle",
    ", one would extract various informations , if one could diagonalize the transfer matrix .",
    "however , in practice , the matrix size exceeds the limit of computer memory size .",
    "such difficulty arises in common with such systems called soft matters , which exhibit , by nature , vast numbers of vibration modes .",
    "therefore , the monte - carlo technique has been employed in order to simulate soft matters . however , after the advent of the density - matrix renormalization group @xcite , the difficulty was removed , and now , soft matters ( elastic systems ) have come under through investigations by means of the diagonalization method ; the examples are lattice vibrations @xcite , collection of oscillators as a heat bath @xcite , string meandering motions @xcite , and lattice scalar field theory @xcite .",
    "in essence , the technique allows us to discard `` irrelevant states , '' and hence , the number of states are truncated so as to save the computer - memory space .",
    "below , we will explain the density - matrix renormalization group .",
    "our algorithm is standard , and pedagogical guide would be found in the proceeding @xcite as well .",
    "the transfer matrix is represented by a strip shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "our goal is to diagonalize the transfer matrix with sufficient length .",
    "we will show that this goal is achieved by the recursive application of the density - matrix renormalization group .",
    "the renormalization procedures are presented in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] , where two sets of renormalizations are shown . through each renormalization ,",
    "a `` block '' and the adjacent site are renormalized into a new `` block@xmath55 ; '' and similarly , block@xmath56 block@xmath57 .",
    "the crucial point is that the number of states for block is kept within @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , we can iterate the procedure until the strip becomes sufficiently long .",
    "such truncation of block states within @xmath58 is managed in the following manner @xcite : one first constructs the density matrix @xmath59 @xcite with respect to the part of system composed of the block and the adjacent site .",
    "then , `` relevant states '' are extracted from the eigenstates @xmath60 of the density matrix with relatively larger eigenvalues @xmath61 ; the density - matrix eigenvalues @xmath61 are called `` weight . '' because the weight @xmath62 becomes almost negligible for large @xmath63 , we just remain relevant @xmath58 states with dominant weight , and discard the other remaining states . in this manner",
    ", the block and the site are renormalized into a new block , whose states are represented by the truncated bases @xmath60 with @xmath64 .",
    "let us demonstrate the reliability .",
    "we will accept the local curvature as the statistical measure . in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] , we present the distribution of weight @xmath61 after 40 renormalizations for bending rigidity @xmath65 .",
    "simulation parameters are set to be @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 ; see eq .",
    "( [ step_discretization ] ) for details .",
    "we see that the weight vanishes very rapidly . in the simulation",
    ", we retain @xmath66 weighted states , and we attain the precision of @xmath69 . in fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] , we present the probability distribution of the step variable . because we have bounded the range of step variable as in eq .",
    "( [ step_discretization ] ) , we must check whether it covers the actual thermal fluctuation deviation .",
    "the range of step variables seems to cover the actual fluctuation deviation .",
    "hence , our treatment of eq .",
    "( [ step_discretization ] ) turns out to be justified . in all simulations",
    "presented hereafter , we had monitored such performance check carefully .",
    "in this section , we study the effective bending rigidity of a fluid membrane . for that purpose ,",
    "we introduce a scheme of real - space decimation @xcite .",
    "then , we apply the density - matrix renormalization group .",
    "all data are calculated after 40 renormalizations ; namely , the length of the transfer matrix extends to @xmath70 .    to avoid confusions",
    ", we will comment a few words : in this paper , the word `` renormalization '' is used in two different contexts .",
    "first , we employ the density - matrix _ renormalization _ group as a simulation technique .",
    "secondly , we manage the real - space _ renormalization _ to get information of effective bending rigidity .",
    "the former terminology is named after the fact that we _",
    "renormalize _ irrelevant states in order to save computer - memory size .",
    "the latter is aimed to gain the _ renormalization_-group flow with length scale changed .",
    "real - space decimation ( coarse graining ) was first introduced in the study of critical phenomena @xcite ; in particular , it was aimed to interpret the scaling hypothesis .",
    "later on , the idea was extended to meet more practical purposes such as quantitative estimation of critical exponents and flow equations @xcite .",
    "we follow swendsen s version of real - space decimation , which has been proven to be very successful @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] , we have presented the real - space - decimation procedure . note that two unit cells are renormalized into one enlarged unit cell .",
    "in other words , two molecules are renormalized into a new molecule , and hence , the parameter @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( [ renormalization_group_equation ] ) is @xmath71 .",
    "correspondingly , from microscopic step variables @xmath36 and @xmath72 , we construct the coarse - grained step variables ; @xmath73 for this coarse - grained length scale , the curvature is given by , @xmath74 after that coarse - graining , one must redefine the unit of length accordingly ; namely , @xmath75    the coarse - grained membrane may be described by the hamiltonian @xmath76 with renormalized bending rigidity @xmath10 .",
    "as is well known , the transformation coefficient @xmath77 contains much information on the infrared behavior of effective coupling constant @xcite .",
    "anticipated behaviors of @xmath5-@xmath10 are drawn schematically in fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] . from the figure",
    ", we see that for @xmath78 , the membrane is stiffened in the infrared limit , whereas for @xmath78 , the membrane is softened .",
    "the transformation coefficient @xmath79 is given by the chain relation @xcite , @xmath80 here , @xmath81 denotes the area of the membrane segment shown in fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] .",
    "remaining task is to perform the above numerical derivatives .",
    "numerical differentiations are possible , because our data are free from statistical errors .",
    "that is a great advantage of our algorithm over others such as monte carlo .",
    "we adopted the `` richardson s deferred approach to the limit '' algorithm in the text book @xcite . in this algorithm",
    ", one takes an extrapolation after calculating various finite - difference differentiations .",
    "we monitored the relative error , and checked that the error is kept within @xmath82 .",
    "following the idea of refs .",
    "@xcite , we will accept the local curvature @xmath20 as for the statistical measure .",
    "this is achieved by adopting the statistical weight ( [ statistical_weight_3 ] ) in the construction of transfer matrix . in fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] , we plotted the transformation coefficient @xmath83 ( [ transformation_coefficient ] ) for the bare coupling @xmath84 . in obtaining the data , we have made a number of trials for the simulation parameters of @xmath58 ( number of block states ) , @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( range of step variables ) ; see eq .",
    "( [ step_discretization ] ) for details .",
    "such technical informations are also presented in the figure caption .",
    "thereby , we confirm that good convergence is achieved with respect to the tuning parameters .    from fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] , we see that the inequality @xmath85 holds .",
    "referring to the anticipated behavior depicted in fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] , we found that the membrane is stiffened effectively for macroscopic length scales .",
    "as a matter of fact , for other integration measures , the inequality @xmath85 is not satisfied as would be shown in the next subsection .",
    "our simulation result is the first _ ab initio _ support of the analytical argument by pinnow and helfrich @xcite .    in the figure , for small rigidity @xmath86 , where thermal undulations should be enhanced , we observe notable enhancement of the transformation coefficient @xmath77",
    "hence , it is indicated that this stiffening is driven , quite contrary to our naive expectation , by thermal undulations .",
    "this rather counterintuitive result suggests that the `` hat excitation '' @xcite , which is a sort of solitonic excitation , would be created over the membrane surface : the hat excitation is a solitonic object accompanying localized dimple - like deformation . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the author claimed that the hat excitations give rise to , unlike conventional sinusoidal undulations , the membrane stiffening .",
    "it would be astonishing that for such small rigidity @xmath87 , where the membrane should be crumpled considerably , the concept of hat excitation is still applicable .",
    "this fact may tell that the hat excitation is indeed solitonic in the sense that the hat excitations are stable under collisions , and the thermal undulations can be decomposed into individually propagating hat excitations .",
    "it is to be noted that such pronounced enhancement of @xmath77 for small @xmath5 is not captured by the analytical one - loop renormalization - group treatment ( [ renormalization_group_equation ] ) , because it just yields @xmath88 for over all @xmath89 .",
    "( it might be convincing , because analytical perturbative treatment should be justified for sufficiently rigid membranes . )",
    "this is obviously the advantage of our first - principle simulation . for exceedingly small rigidity @xmath90",
    ", however , the membrane becomes too much crumpled , and we can not continue reliable simulation .",
    "( from a technical viewpoint , the density - matrix weight exhibits almost uniform distribution , and we can not set any reasonable threshold for the truncation of states . )    on the other hand , for large - rigidity side @xmath91 , we see that the transformation coefficient approach the neutral value @xmath92 .",
    "note that the analytical one - loop renormalization - group analysis ( [ renormalization_group_equation ] ) yields @xmath93 .",
    "hence , we see that for sufficiently large @xmath5 , the analytical result ( [ renormalization_group_equation ] ) is recovered asymptotically .      for other integration measures such as normal displacement @xmath16 ( [ statistical_weight_1 ] ) and tilt angle @xmath17 ( [ statistical_weight_4 ] )",
    ", we found behaviors quite contrastive to that shown in the previous subsection . in fig .",
    "[ figure8 ] , we plotted transformation coefficient @xmath94 for the normal - displacement integration measure ( [ statistical_weight_1 ] ) .",
    "( note that this integration measure has been widely used so far in the analytical calculations except refs .",
    "@xcite . ) from the figure , we see definitely that @xmath95 holds .",
    "hence , in this case , the membrane is softened effectively for macroscopic length scales ; see the schematic behavior shown in fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] .",
    "in addition , it is to be noted that for small rigidity @xmath96 , the transformation coefficient @xmath83 is suppressed , and it approaches the neutral value @xmath97 as the membrane rigidity @xmath5 increases .",
    "this fact tells that the softening is driven by the thermal undulations .",
    "note that the effect of thermal undulations appears in a way quite opposite to the aforementioned @xmath20 statistical measure .",
    "in the case of tilt - angle statistical measure ( [ statistical_weight_4 ] ) , the transformation coefficient exhibits similar behavior @xmath98 ; see fig .",
    "[ figure9 ] .",
    "however , @xmath77 is much closer to the neutral value @xmath99 , suggesting that the extent of softening is smaller than that of the normal - displacement integration measure . in other words ,",
    "the membrane shape would stay almost scale - invariant under the choice of tilt angle as for the statistical measure .    in the calculations presented in this subsection ( particularly , for the @xmath16 measure ) , the simulations suffered from instabilities coming from unbounded undulations due to the membrane softening .",
    "more specifically , during the simulation , membrane becomes crumpled spontaneously , and the membrane shape is trapped to a certain metastable configuration .",
    "such pathology may arise , because there are exceedingly numerous thermally activated configurations of almost equal statistical weight .",
    "diagonalization of transfer matrix thus fails in searching true globally - stable thermal equilibrium .",
    "moreover , the postulation of eq .",
    "( [ step_discretization ] ) would not be fully justified , where we had assumed that the range of step variable is bounded . as the simulation parameters of @xmath58 and @xmath48 are improved ,",
    "those instabilities are avoided to some extent . in a sense ,",
    "those instabilities reflect the fact that the membrane is softened indeed , and the shape fluctuations are enhanced for long distances . from the above experience , we are led to the speculation that the monge gauge would not be very justified for the description of fluid membranes in the case of softening , at least , beyond perturbative level .",
    "we have investigated the effective bending rigidity ( [ renormalization_group_equation ] ) of a fluid membrane ( [ hamiltonian ] ) for macroscopic length scales .",
    "the effective rigidity has been arousing renewed interest , since pinnow and helfrich pointed out that the membranes would be _ stiffened _ by thermal undulations .",
    "the key ingredient of their argument is that the local curvature should be the right statistical measure for the partition sum .",
    "motivated by this remarkable scenario , we had performed first - principle simulation with the transfer - matrix method and the density - matrix renormalization group ; see figs .",
    "[ figure1 ] and [ figure2 ] .",
    "our simulation scheme does not rely on any perturbative treatments , and it covers various statistical measures such as local curvature ( [ statistical_weight_3 ] ) , normal displacement ( [ statistical_weight_1 ] ) and tilt angle ( [ statistical_weight_4 ] ) . because analytical variable replacements among those variables require rather tedious task even on perturbative level , it would be meaningful to survey various measure factors systematically by _ ab initio _ simulation .",
    "performance of the simulation scheme is demonstrated in figs .",
    "[ figure3 ] and [ figure4 ] .",
    "we introduced a scheme of real - space decimation as is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] , and correspondingly , we defined coarse - grained curvature @xmath100 ( [ coarse_grained_j ] ) .",
    "those preparations enable us to calculate the transformation coefficient @xmath79 ( [ transformation_coefficient ] ) , from which we read off the direction of renormalization group flow ; its anticipated behaviors are drawn schematically in fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] . as a consequence , in respect of statistical measures",
    ", we observed clear distinction between the mean curvature @xmath85 and the others @xmath101 .",
    "namely , when we accept mean curvature as a statistical measure , the effective rigidity is , in fact , renormalized toward strong coupling ; see fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] .",
    "that is , membrane stiffening takes place . on the contrary ,",
    "both normal displacement and tilt angle appear to lead to membrane softening ; see figs .",
    "[ figure8 ] and [ figure9 ] .",
    "our simulation results are the first _ ab initio _ support of the aforementioned analytical argument @xcite .",
    "the membrane stiffening , apart from its mere curiousness , is quite favorable for the consistency of our numerical simulation : in our simulation , in the first place , we had restricted the range of step variables as in eq .",
    "( [ transformation_coefficient ] ) .",
    "apparently , this postulation is in favor of membrane stiffening .",
    "in addition , we had discarded irrelevant states through the density - matrix renormalization group in order to keep the number of states tractable in computers .",
    "again , this truncation of states is validated consequently after the onset of membrane stiffening .",
    "furthermore , we believe that the very starting point of our theory , namely , the monge gauge , is in favor of membrane stiffening , because it is assumed that there exists a reference plane from which all undulations are excited .",
    "membrane stiffening may serve solid grounds for the monge gauge .    for those reasons",
    ", we could perform well - controlled simulation in the case of membrane stiffening . on the contrary , as for the case of membrane softening",
    ", our simulation faces a number of conflicts coming from unbounded undulations as the strip length of transfer matrix is enlarged ; see section [ section3_3 ] for details .",
    "because such pronounced undulations deprive the grounds of the reference plane , it would be rather suspicious to adopt the monge gauge at least beyond perturbative level . by the way , we are fairly confident of the efficiency of our simulation in the case of membrane stiffening , and we believe that the membrane stiffening may serve a new promising research field for the application of the density - matrix renormalization group .",
    "the following problems remain open : first , in the article @xcite , the author raised an intriguing picture of deformation mode called `` hat excitation . ''",
    "this is a sort of soliton which is in contrast to the naive sinusoidal undulation . with the hat - excitation picture ,",
    "the author gave valuable physical insights .",
    "first - principle examination of the reality of this hat excitation would be desirable .",
    "secondly , irrespective of the membrane stiffening , the correlation length is known to be finite , and the orientational correlation is lost for long distances @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is speculated that those two modes , namely , orientation and curvature , would be decoupled",
