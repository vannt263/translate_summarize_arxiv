    "we begin discussing this method in the case of a single background source . here a collection of setup cuts have been applied which eliminate all other sources of background .",
    "our goal is to predict the amount of background in the signal region when we apply the cuts @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which we refer to as the bifurcation cuts .",
    "the number of events we observe will be determined by the number of events before applying the cuts @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( after applying the setup cuts ) and the cut survival probability ( csp ) : @xmath3 we consider events to lie in a multi - dimensional space with a dimension corresponding to every variable on which we can cut .",
    "our set of cuts defines a multidimensional signal region which we wish to keep blind .",
    "if two cuts show no correlation in the events that they cut , this implies that these two cuts are orthogonal in this space . a diagram of this situation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : geometricbifurcation ] .",
    "the csp can then be decomposed into @xmath4 @xmath5 this can be expanded into @xmath6 here @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the inverses of cuts @xmath1 and @xmath2 , events which pass cut @xmath1 fail cut @xmath7 .",
    "then we can calculate this from data based on the number of observed events in the signal region under the different cut conditions : @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the number of background events observed with the application of cut @xmath1 and the inverse of cut @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath11 is the observed background events with the inverse of cut @xmath1 and cut @xmath2 applied .",
    "@xmath12 is the count when the inverse of both @xmath1 and @xmath2 are applied .",
    "all of these values are outside the signal region defined in the multi - dimensional cut space allowing us to predict the background without opening the box : @xmath13 the procedure for producing a background prediction is as follows .",
    "first , apply setup cuts to the data , the number of events in the signal box is @xmath14 .",
    "the setup cuts are all the cuts other than @xmath1 or @xmath2 , which are applied .",
    "they should remove all other background sources .",
    "there is more freedom in choosing the setup cuts than cuts @xmath1 and @xmath2 , since they can be correlated with each other or @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we then apply cut @xmath1 and @xmath8 . by applying @xmath8",
    ", we are looking at events which are outside the signal box in the multidimensional space .",
    "we count the number of events which pass these sets of cuts , @xmath10 .",
    "we then do the same procedure in reverse applying the set of cuts @xmath2 and the inverse of @xmath1 to find @xmath15 .",
    "finally , we apply the inverse of both cuts @xmath1 and @xmath2 to find @xmath16 these values are combined to produce the background prediction .",
    "eqn [ bkg1sol ] predicts no background events , if @xmath10 or @xmath15 are zero .",
    "this can be true for one of three reasons : @xmath17 , @xmath18 or @xmath19=0 , or @xmath20 or @xmath21 .",
    "the first two possibilities are what we expect and reflect cases where there should be no background events .",
    "the third possibility is more problematic .",
    "when @xmath20 or @xmath21 , @xmath12 should also be zero , but statistical fluctuations may prevent that from being true .",
    "this condition results from a poor choice of cuts where one cut eliminates almost no background events . if possible a different choice of cuts for @xmath1 and @xmath2 should be made .",
    "each event is described by four variables . two kinematic variables , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , which are used to describe the signal region and two cut variables , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 , which will be used to define the cuts . the cut variables , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , are independent of the kinematic variables , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "all of these variables range from 0 to 1 .",
    "we define 2 different types of events : background 1 and background 2 .",
    "they both have @xmath23 variables with uniform distributions between 0 and 1 .",
    "their @xmath22 s have uniform distributions between 0 and @xmath23 for background 1 and between 0 and @xmath26 for background 2 .",
    "background 1 has an uniform distribution of @xmath24 between 0 and 1 and variable @xmath25 has a linearly decreasing density with values between 0 and 1 .",
    "background 2 s @xmath24 distribution is a linearly decreasing density with values between 0 and 1 and an uniform distribution between 0 and 1 for @xmath25 .",
    "the distribution of each variable for the two background types is shown in table [ variable ] .",
    "the distributions of the kinematic variables @xmath22 and @xmath23 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kinvar ] .",
    "we define a signal region by specifying the allowed kinematic variables : @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    ".probability distribution functions for the variables of each event type in the toy model . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     the @xmath29 decay has three ways in which it can cause backgrounds depending on the number of photons lost through veto inefficiency or fusion of photon clusters in the csi . these three channels are not separated in the signal space , so our estimate of cut correlation includes contribution from these multiple background types .",
    "the statistical uncertainties on both the correlation and the core neutron correction are large relative to their size .",
    "therefore we decided to use these values as estimates of the systematic error made by neglecting the correlation and multiple background corrections .",
    "this results in a background prediction of @xmath30 .",
    "opening the signal box , we observed a single event , consistent with our background prediction .",
    "the bifurcation analysis technique allows us to produce data driven background predictions while still maintaining a blind analysis . in this paper",
    "we have shown how to extend the bifurcation analysis to the case of two background sources and correlated cuts .",
    "the correction for a second background source is effective for any level of secondary background . it does require information beyond which is available directly from a blind analysis .",
    "it requires a combination of monte carlo information about the relative strengths of the two backgrounds and how the cut survival probabilities vary between the two backgrounds .",
    "it also requires knowledge of @xmath31 , the number of events in the signal box after the setup cuts .",
    "correlations between the two cuts can not be handled as easily .",
    "even when the correlation between cuts is linear , the effects on the background prediction are non - linear .",
    "therefore , special care must be taken when selecting the cuts for the bifurcation analysis to avoid correlation .",
    "one particular aspect of the impact of the prediction on the cut correlation is it s dependance on the value of @xmath32 this leads to two competing forces in optimizing the division of cuts into the setup cuts and the bifurcation cuts . from the perspective of minimizing statistical error in the bifurcation prediction , one would like a large value for @xmath14 with powerful cuts for cut @xmath1 and @xmath2 , so that the statistical errors on the terms of eqn [ bkg1sol ] are small . on the other hand ,",
