    "the wang - landau ( wl ) algorithm @xcite , introduced in 2001 , has received much attention and has been applied to a wide range of problems @xcite . in most of these investigations ,",
    "the authors have applied the wl algorithm to systems with discrete energy levels . however , relatively fewer papers have so far appeared on lattice models with continuous energy spectrum @xcite .",
    "techniques , in general , to improve the algorithm for different problems have also been proposed @xcite .",
    "the review @xcite illustrates the versatile applications of the wl algorithm in protein folding , fluid simulations , systems with first order phase transitions and other systems with rough energy terrain .",
    "some authors find its applications in performing numerical integration @xcite .",
    "the wl algorithm allows us to calculate the density of states ( dos ) as a function of energy or the joint density of states ( jdos ) as a function of energy and a second variable @xcite . for a macroscopic system , the dos @xmath0 ( where @xmath1 , @xmath2 being the bin index ) is a large number and it is convenient to work with its logarithm @xmath3 .",
    "since the dos is independent of temperature and contains complete information about the system , the task is to determine it as accurately as possible .",
    "the next step involves the determination of partition function ( @xmath4 , boltzmann constant has been set to unity ) at any temperature ( @xmath5 ) by the standard boltzmann reweighting procedure .",
    "once the partition function is known , the model is essentially `` solved '' since most thermodynamic quantities at any temperature can be calculated from it .",
    "the algorithm is implemented by performing an one - dimensional random walk that produces a `` flat '' histogram in the energy space . for a continuous model , one needs to use a discretization scheme to divide the energy range of interest into a number of bins which label the macrostates of the system . in the wl algorithm ,",
    "these macrostates are sampled with a probability which is proportional to the reciprocal of the current dos .",
    "the estimate for the dos is improved at each step of the random walk using a carefully controlled modification factor @xmath6 to produce a result that converges to the true dos quickly .",
    "a histogram record @xmath7 of all states visited is maintained throughout the simulation .",
    "when @xmath8 corresponding to a certain macrostate is modified as @xmath9 , the corresponding @xmath7 is modified as @xmath10 . in the original proposal of wl algorithm ,",
    "an iteration is said to be complete when the histogram satisfies a certain `` flatness '' condition .",
    "this means that @xmath7 , for all values of @xmath11 , has attained @xmath12 ( or some other preset value ) of the average histogram . in the following iteration",
    ", @xmath6 is reduced in some fashion , the @xmath7 s are reset to zero and the process is continued till @xmath13 is as small as @xmath14 or @xmath15 . since the history of the entire sampling process determines the dos , the wl algorithm is non - markovian besides being multicanonical in nature .",
    "in course of the random walk in a wl simulation , the fluctuations of energy histogram , for a given modification factor @xmath6 , initially grows with time and then saturates to a certain value .",
    "zhou and bhatt @xcite carried out a mathematical analysis of the wl algorithm .",
    "they provided a proof of the convergence of the iterative procedure and have shown that the fluctuations in histogram , proportional to @xmath16 for a given @xmath6 , cause statistical errors which can be reduced by averaging over multiple simulations .",
    "they have also shown that the correlation between adjacent records in the histogram introduces a systematic error which is reduced at smaller @xmath6 .",
    "the prediction in ref .",
    "@xcite has been numerically verified by different authors independently @xcite .",
    "although to obtain a flat histogram is the initial motivation behind the wl algorithm , ref .",
    "@xcite concluded that flatness is not a necessary criterion to achieve convergence and suggested that one should instead focus on the fluctuations of the histogram rather than the `` flatness '' .",
    "they had shown that @xmath16 visits on each macroscopic state is enough to guarantee the convergence .",
    "in fact , fluctuations in the histogram is intrinsic to wl algorithm .",
    "these fluctuations lead to a statistical error in the dos which scales as @xmath17 , for a given @xmath6 .",
    "the iterative wl algorithm partially reduces this statistical fluctuations by decreasing @xmath6 monotonically .",
    "however ref .",
    "@xcite clearly illustrates that even if @xmath6 is reduced to a very small value according to the original prescription , the statistical error stops to decrease at a certain point . in practice there",
    "always exists a systematic error in the simulation which is a function of @xmath6 and the correlation between adjacent records in the histogram . ref .",
    "@xcite observed that this systematic error decreases when either @xmath6 or the correlation decreases . in this context , we refer to the work of morozov and lin @xcite who presented a study on the estimations of accuracy and convergence of the wang - landau algorithm on a two level system with a significant efficiency improvement in @xcite .",
    "the wl algorithm compares @xmath18 and @xmath19 , i.e , dos before and after an attempted move , but it does not require @xmath20 to be close to @xmath21 .",
    "this is why ref .",
    "@xcite suggested the use of cluster algorithms that allow `` nonlocal '' moves in the parameter space . the ref .",
    "@xcite rightly pointed out that the update schemes for the underlying model certainly have an effect on the outcome . in the present paper",
    "we suggest a method for the spin update scheme of a lattice model with continuous energy spectrum , which reduces the autocorrelation time by an appreciable amount compared to the conventional spin update scheme .",
    "the suggested spin update method to obtain a less correlated configuration has also the advantage that this method is free from tuning any adjustable parameter .",
    "the method is described in section [ ct ] .",
    "we also investigate the growth of the histogram fluctuations in the one - dimensional lebwohl - lasher ( ll ) model , described in section [ model ] , to check if the nature of the dependence of the maximum of the histogram fluctuations on the modification factor @xmath6 is model independent or not .",
    "we mention in passing that ref .",
    "@xcite suggested the model - independent nature of the maximum of the histogram fluctuations by performing simulations on two discrete ising models and concluded that many more simulations on different models are needed to confirm this universality nature .",
    "@xcite confirmed this universality behavior for two continuous lattice spin models with spin dimensionality two .",
    "we have found that for the present model ( spin dimensionality three ) , the fluctuations in the energy histogram , after an initial increase , saturates to a value which is inversely proportional to @xmath17 and confirm that this feature is generic to the wl algorithm . in the second part of the work ,",
    "we have carried out the wl simulation with the proposed spin update scheme to estimate the canonical averages of various thermodynamic quantities for lattices of reasonably large size where minimum number of visits to each macrostate are @xmath22 .",
    "results obtained from our simulation are compared with the exact results available for the model .",
    "the rest of the paper is arranged as follows . in section [ model ] , we have described the model .",
    "the computational techniques are discussed in section [ ct ] .",
    "section [ rd ] presents our results and discussions .",
    "section [ conclu ] draws the conclusions .",
    "for the purpose of investigation , we have chosen an one - dimensional array of three - dimensional spins ( @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the space dimensionality and @xmath25 is the spin dimensionality ) interacting with nearest neighbors ( nn ) via a potential @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the second legendre polynomial and @xmath28 is the angle between the nearest neighbor spins @xmath11 and @xmath29 ( the coupling constant in the interaction has been set to unity ) .",
    "the spins are three - dimensional and headless , i.e , the system has the @xmath30 as well as the local @xmath31 symmetry , characteristic of a nematic liquid crystal .",
    "the model , known as the lebwohl - lasher ( ll ) model @xcite , is the lattice version of the maier - saupe ( ms ) model @xcite which describes a nematic liquid crystal in the mean field approximation .",
    "being a low - dimensional model with nn interaction , the @xmath32 ll model does not exhibit any finite temperature phase transition .",
    "this model has been solved exactly by vuillermot and romerio @xcite in @xmath33 , using a group theoretical method .",
    "the results obtained in @xcite are quoted below .",
    "the partition function @xmath34 for the @xmath35-particle system is given by @xmath36d^n(\\widetilde k^{1/2 } ) \\label{eqn2}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is a dimensionless quantity .",
    "@xmath38 is the dawson function @xcite given by @xmath39 the dimensionless internal energy @xmath40 , entropy @xmath41 and the specific heat @xmath42 are given by @xmath43 @xmath44 \\label{eqn5}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] @xmath45d^{-1 } \\left ( \\widetilde k^{1/2}\\right ) \\\\",
    "-\\frac{1}{2 } \\widetilde k d^{-2}\\left(\\widetilde k^{1/2}\\right ) \\label{eqn6}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] we decided to choose this model to test the performance of wl algorithm using the suggested spin update scheme so that a comparison can be made with the exact results available for the model .",
    "in the first part of this section , we will describe the computational techniques used to determine the fluctuations in the energy histogram . in the later part of this section",
    ", we will discuss the method for the new spin update scheme .",
    "let us first explain the notations and symbols relevant to the present work .",
    "the saturation value of the energy histogram fluctuation in the @xmath46 iteration is represented by @xmath47 .",
    "let @xmath48 be the modification factor for the @xmath46 iteration .",
    "one usually starts with a modification factor @xmath49 and uses a sequence of decreasing @xmath48 s ( @xmath50 ) defined in some manner .",
    "one monte carlo ( mc ) sweep is taken to be completed when the number of attempted single spin moves equals the number of spins in the system .",
    "the error in the dos after the @xmath51 iteration is directly related to @xmath52 for @xmath53 , the saturation values of the fluctuations . in the wl algorithm",
    "the logarithm of the dos after @xmath2 iterations is given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the accumulated histogram count for the @xmath56 energy bin during the @xmath46 iteration . in order to get an idea of the fluctuations in the histogram and its growth with the number of mc sweeps",
    ", we subtract the minimum of the histogram count @xmath57 which occurs in the histogram after the @xmath58 mc sweep has been completed during the @xmath46 iteration , i.e. , we consider the quantity @xmath59 it may be noted that @xmath57 does not refer to any particular bin and may occur in any of the visited bins . the quantity @xmath60 is now summed over all bins to give @xmath61 .",
    "@xmath62 @xmath61 is thus a measure of the fluctuations which occurs in the @xmath58 mc sweep during @xmath46 iteration and is a sort of average over all macrostates or bins .",
    "@xmath61 fluctuates with @xmath29 because of statistical errors and its mean value taken over @xmath29 is nothing but @xmath47 .",
    "the error of the logarithm of the dos , summed over all energy levels or bins , after the completion of @xmath2 iterations is therefore given by @xcite @xmath63 eq .",
    "( [ eqn10 ] ) means that the error depends only on the fluctuations in histogram and the sequence of modification factors .",
    "when the values of @xmath48 are predetermined , the fluctuations in histogram , i.e. , @xmath61 , becomes the only determining factor for the error .",
    "for this reason the observable @xmath61 , defined by eq .",
    "( [ eqn9 ] ) , is considered to be a good measure of the fluctutations in histogram .",
    "however , we point out that because of the summation over the index @xmath11 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn9 ] ) , the nature of the distribution of the errors over the energy bins is not reflected in the summed quantity @xmath61 .",
    "what we get instead is an error which has been summed over all the energy bins .",
    "since the predicted value of the error @xmath64 is of the order of @xmath65 @xcite , one expects that the histogram saturation value @xmath66 , for the @xmath51 iteration , should be proportional to @xmath67 .",
    "now we discuss the method to generate a subsequent less - correlated spin configuration . in the conventional spin update method for a continuous lattice spin model",
    ", the orientation of each spin @xmath68 is stored in terms of the direction cosines @xmath69 . to generate a new configuration ( microstate ) , a spin is selected at random and each direction cosine of it is updated as @xmath70 for ( @xmath71 ) where the parameter `` p '' denotes the amplitude of the random angular displacements , chosen such that approximately half of the configurations are accepted and half rejected @xcite and @xmath72 is a random number between @xmath73 to @xmath74 .",
    "we have seen for a number of continuous lattice spin models that the results for the thermodynamic quantities become very sensitive to the value of the parameter `` p '' .",
    "`` p '' is generally taken such that @xmath75 and the choice of `` p '' also depends on the systems we are working on .",
    "the reason for taking @xmath75 is that small values of `` p '' correspond to small changes in the direction of the spin , i.e. , the energy cost of an attempted move will be small . however , this is not the only form of update , nor is it known whether this is the most efficient form .",
    "the thing is , there is quite a lot of flexibility about the choice of the new state for the spins .",
    "a good discussion of it may be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we propose a novel protocol to generate a less - correlated spin configuration in the following manner .",
    "we take a random unit vector @xmath76 and a spin update @xmath77 is defined as @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the dot product of @xmath68 and @xmath76 .",
    "this represents a reflection with respect to the hyperplane orthogonal to @xmath76 and this is an idempotent operation .",
    "the idea came from wolff @xcite .",
    "one may think of a linear transformation @xmath80 such that @xmath81 .",
    "this linear transformation has the property @xmath82 i.e. , idempotent and @xmath83\\cdot[r(\\vec r)\\vec s_2]=\\vec s_1 \\cdot \\vec s_2\\ ] ] i.e. , the hamiltonian ( [ eqn1 ] ) is invariant under global r transformations .",
    "this spin update method reduces the autocorrelation time to a considerable amount and consequently systematic error decreases .",
    "moreover , defining a spin update in that way , the algorithm becomes free from tuning any adjustable parameter even while simulating a lattice spin model with continuous energy spectrum .",
    "this spin update method has resulted in efficient simulation of continuous lattice spin models with @xmath84 symmetry @xcite .",
    "the energy of the @xmath32 ll model is a continuous variable and it can have any value between @xmath85 to @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the system size . to discretize",
    "the system , we have chosen an energy range ( @xmath88 ) and divided this energy range into a number of bins ( macrostates ) each having a width , say @xmath89 .",
    "in the present work , the bin width is taken to be @xmath90 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ table1 ]",
    "to summarize , we have tested the performance of the wl algorithm in a continuous lattice spin model , namely , the @xmath32 ll model which describes a nematic liquid crystal in the mean field approximation . the results obtained from our simulation",
    "are compared with the exact results available for this model .",
    "it has been observed that the results obtained tally accurately with the exact results .",
    "we focus on the fluctuations of histogram and replace the `` flatness '' criterion with that of minimum histogram .",
    "we have found that in this continuous lattice model , the fluctuations in the energy histogram , after an initial accumulation stage , saturates to a value that is proportional to @xmath91 where @xmath6 is the modification factor in the wl algorithm and confirm that this behavior is generic to the wl algorithm .",
    "we also present a novel method for spin update scheme to obtain a subsequent configuration which is less - correlated than the previous method .",
    "the proposed spin update scheme makes the wl `` driver '' to move from one sampling point to the next faster . as a result ,",
    "the autocorrelation time between successive moves decreases and the convergence becomes faster .",
    "it may be noted that the wl algorithm only asks for the next sampling point ( say @xmath92 ) with probability distribution @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the exact and the estimated dos respectively .",
    "a previous study @xcite suggested that @xmath35-fold way updates yields better performance in flat - histogram sampling .",
    "however , dayal @xmath96 @xcite argued that the performance is limited by the added expense of the cpu time needed to implement the @xmath35-fold way updates .",
    "the proposed method is simple to implement and has also the merit that it makes us free from tuning any adjustable parameter while simulating a continuous lattice spin model .",
    "although the method has been applied to a liquid crystalline system in the present work , the method can , in general , be applied to any lattice spin model with continuous energy spectrum .",
    "this method has resulted in efficient simulation of continuous models with @xmath84 symmetry @xcite .",
    "finally , we stress that the focus in this paper is to test the performance of the wl algorithm in continuous lattice spin models with the proposed spin update scheme .",
    "we hope that this spin update method will be of general interest in the area of research in monte carlo simulations of continuous lattice spin models .",
