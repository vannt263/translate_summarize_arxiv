    "the key question of galaxy evolution is the dependence of star formation rate @xmath3 on the gas density and other interstellar medium parameters , averaged by large enough area or volume for smoothing random fluctuations in gas and young stars distributions .",
    "scmidt  @xcite suggested a simple form of star formation rate parameterization : @xmath7 , usually called the schmidt law . from the analysis of gas and young objects distribution in the solar vicinity ,",
    "schmidt  @xcite obtained @xmath8 .",
    "later a large number of papers were published aimed to check and to interpret the schmidt law , based on the gas and @xmath3 distributions in the discs of spiral galaxies . in particular , it was found that both local , azimuthally averaged @xmath3 values as well as the total star formation rate in a galaxy correlate ( although not too tightly ) with the gas content in its disc ( e.g. madore et al .",
    ",  @xcite , kennicutt ,  @xcite , wong&blitz ,  @xcite , boissier et al .",
    ",  @xcite , shuster et al . ,",
    "being empirical by it sence , the schmidt law and its modifications open a possibility to calculate evolution models of galaxies , parameterizing the star formation history .",
    "this allows us to understand better mechanisms which regulate the rate of star formation .",
    "a situation is entangled by the fact that the dependence @xmath9 ( i.e. the local schmidt law ) and , in particular , the power @xmath5 ca nt be found directly from observations of other galaxies , because in order to estimate the volume - related values of @xmath10 and @xmath2 it is necessary to know the gas layer thickness , which may vary significantly both along the galaxy radius and from one galaxy to another .",
    "therefore in practice the schmidt law is often replaced by the other one , outwardly alike empirical law @xmath11 ( sometimes it is called kennicutt  schmidt law ) , where the compared values are scaled to unit disc surface area , or by the law @xmath12 for the total values @xmath13 and gas mass @xmath14 ( so - called the global schmidt law ) .",
    "these dependencies are more complicated for interpretation , because the compared parameters are the integrals of heterogeneous functions of distribution along of the line - of - sight ( in the first case ) or allover a whole disc ( for the global law ) . in general case",
    ", parameters @xmath5 and @xmath15 must not coincide ( see the discussion of the question in papers madore et al .",
    ",  @xcite , tutukov ,  @xcite ) . only if at any distance from disc plane @xmath16 , the power @xmath15 is also equal to unit . in most cases values of @xmath15 that obtained for different galaxies lay within the limits of @xmath17 ( wong and blitz ,  @xcite , boissier et al .",
    ",  @xcite , shuster et al .",
    ",  @xcite ) , but for some galaxies they proves to be more steep .",
    "for example , for m  33 @xmath183 ( heyer et al . ,",
    "@xcite ) . for the case of the global schmidt law when different galaxies are compared , @xmath19 ( kennicutt ,  @xcite , li et al . ,",
    "the scatter of @xmath15 remains large : for galaxies with similar gas masses @xmath13 may differ by an order of magnitude .",
    "apparently , it is possible to reproduce the schmidt law for different star formation models using some simplifying assumptions on mechanisms of self - regulation of large - scale star formation , or considering conversion of neutral gas into dense molecular clouds and formation of stars ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "note however that usually variation of the thickness of gas layer along galactic radius as well as from one galaxy to another is ignored , and @xmath2 is accepted to be much smaller than the volume stellar density , that is not always correct .    in the first part of this paper , the gas volume density in the plane of an equilibrium disc is calculated as a function of @xmath1 for several nearby galaxies . in the second part , the relation between the gas density and star formation rate is analyzed .",
    "chosen galaxies strongly differs by their properties .",
    "they include : m  33 and m  101  multiarmed late - type galaxies ( sc ) , the first of them is rather small ; interacting galaxy m  51 and galaxy m  100 which are distinguished by high molecular gas content ; seyfert galaxy m  106 where the ejections from nucleus and star formation burst in the inner region are observed ; massive early - type sab galaxy m  81 which possesses a large bulge and regular spiral structure , and , finally , our galaxy .",
    "the main simplifications we use are the following .",
    "the gaseous layers in galaxies are assumed to be axisymmetric and being in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the pressure of the gas is determined by its turbulent motion : @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is one - dimensional velocity dispersion , which is assumed to be constant ( although different for atomic and molecular gas ) .",
    "these simplifying suggestions are definitely too tough for regions enveloped by the intensive star formation , for the inner discs deep inside dense bulges or in the neighborhood of active nucleus , and also for the far periphery of discs .",
    "note however that gas velocity dispersion , although may slowly vary with the distance from the galaxy center , remains high enough even at large distances ( see the discussion in paper dib et al .",
    ",  @xcite ) . magnetic field pressure gradient and thermal gas pressure play significantly lesser role in the formation of gas layer thickness , at least for the case of our galaxy ( see discussion of this question in cox review ,  @xcite ) .",
    "it is essential that within the limits of approximations mentioned above the observed distribution of atomic ( hi ) and molecular ( h@xmath22 ) hydrogen disc thicknesses along the galaxy s radius can be sufficiently explained ( narayan and jog ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the gaseous disc thickness depends on the turbulent gas velocity and gradient of gravitational potential along the @xmath23-coordinate , perpendicular to disc plane .",
    "the latter is a sum of gravitational potentials of all galaxy components .",
    "therefore for the gas density estimation one have to know not only individual component masses , but also the vertical profile of stellar disc density .",
    "both stellar and gaseous disc scale heights are much less than their radial scales . it allows to ignore the influence of the radial heterogeneity of discs on the vertical gradient of potential .",
    "our approach to the estimation of the vertical gaseous and stellar density distributions is similar to that described by narayan and jog ,  @xcite .",
    "hydrostatic equilibrium equation can be written as @xmath24 here @xmath25 is the volume density , index @xmath26 ( asterisk , @xmath27 ) corresponds to the stellar , atomic , or molecular discs , and @xmath28 is vertical dispersion of velocities .    under assumptions",
    "already mentioned , the stellar , atomic , and molecular volume density distributions are described by the equation that follows from condition of the hydrostatic equilibrium ( [ 10000 ] ) ( equation ( 3 ) in paper  @xcite ) : @xmath29 + \\frac{1}{\\rho_i}\\,\\left(\\frac{{\\rm d}\\rho_i}{{\\rm d}z}\\right)^2\\,.\\ ] ] here @xmath30 describes the input of dark halo , where @xmath31+\\ ] ] @xmath32~-\\ ] ] is the @xmath23-component of the second derivative of the halo potential in cylindrical coordinates  ( @xcite ) .",
    "the density distribution in the halo is accepted to be quasi - isothermal : @xmath33 here @xmath1 is the distance from the center of galaxy , and @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the circular velocity and nucleus radius of the halo , respectively .",
    "equations  ( [ 100 ] ) , applied to each galaxy component , can be reduced to the first order equations .",
    "their self - consistent solutions are found by fourth - order runge ",
    "kutta method .",
    "two boundary conditions required for the mid - plane , @xmath36 are : @xmath37 values of the central densities @xmath38 can be determined from the following evident condition @xmath39 ( here @xmath40 is the observed radial distribution of surface , or column , densities of corresponding components ) and are found by the bissection algorithm .",
    "initially , equations  ( [ 100 ] ) are solved for stellar disc assuming @xmath41 .",
    "after that , using the obtained solution , equation for hi is solved with @xmath42 .",
    "finally , equation for molecular hydrogen is solved using values obtained earlier for hi and stars .",
    "this procedure is iterated using @xmath43 obtained in previous iterations , until the solution converges .",
    "thickness of discs is calculated as doubled half - width - half - maximum ( hwhm ) value of corresponding density distribution .    indeed , to find the gas density by the method described above , it is necessary to calculate masses of each component of a galaxy as well as to find stellar disc velocity dispersion , which varies significantly with @xmath1 even for a single galaxy unlike the gas velocity dispersion .    for all galaxies from our sample , except our galaxy",
    ", stellar disc surface densities were estimated from the available data on the radial surface brightness distribution in disc and disc s integral color index corrected for galactic absorption and inclination ( based on the hyeperleda  @xcite database or original photometry taken from the literature ) .",
    "we ignored the central parts of galaxies where the bulge dominates and/or observed circular rotation curve is uncertain .",
    "the largest values of @xmath1 we considered were limited by extention of measured rotation curve or ( m  101 , m  106 ) gas surface density distribution . to convert the surface brightness to stellar disc surface density , we used the mass - to - luminosity ratios corresponding to color index of discs ( table a3 in bell & de jong  @xcite ) .",
    "these ratios were used as the first approximation to decompose the rotation curve in the frames of three - component model of galaxies which consist of the bulge , exponential disc , and quasi - isothermal halo .",
    ".properties of the galaxies .",
    "_ columns _ : ( 1 )  galaxy , ( 2 )  distance , ( 3 )  inclination , ( 4 )  major axis diameter at the b=25@xmath44/@xmath45 isophote , ( 5 )  radial interval , for which parameter @xmath5 in schmidt law is derived .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      as it follows from the table , the relative thickness of stellar disc @xmath48 at @xmath49 lies within the range of 0.10.3 .",
    "our galaxy is the most thin ( @xmath50 ) in our sample , whereas the stellar discs of two giant early type spiral galaxies ( m  81 and m  106 ) are almost three times thicker .",
    "the thicknesses of gas layers differ less than stellar ones in the galaxies . the most thin gas layer ( in m  33 ) is less than twice thinner than the most thick one ( in m  101 ) .",
    "the gas density ( at distance @xmath51 ) in all cases is equal to several units of 10@xmath52g/@xmath53 with no obvious dependence on the morphological type : in m  101 ( sc ) it is approximately the same as in m  81 ( sab ) , and in our galaxy ( sb  sbc ) it is close to that in m  33 .",
    "the comparison of the gaseous density with the star formation rates ( figures[fig9]a ,  [ fig9]b , and  [ fig10]a ) gives an evidence that the replacement of surface gas density ( figure  [ fig9]b ) by the gas volume density leads to more tight dependencies both for the `` surface '' and `` volume '' star formation rates .",
    "the reason for it is rather evident : star formation takes place in a narrow layer near the midplane , hence this process is sensitive namely to the volume gas density , whereas the directly measured surface gas density depends , in addition , to the gas layer thickness ( more precisely  to the vertical density profile ) , which differs from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "it is worth to remind that the regions that are very close to the center ( in all galaxies but m  33 ) , or are located at the disc peripheries ( beyond the well defined spiral arms ) need a special study and were not considered in this paper .",
    "indeed , here we ignored the influence of the bulge on the vertical density profiles .",
    "the accepted value of the turbulent velocity may also be not suitable for all radii .",
    "a formal inclusion of the most inner and outer regions into our diagrams leads to the resulting dependencies `` gas density@xmath3 '' which are less regular and more different between galaxies .    of the galaxies we consider",
    ", m  106 stands out by almost constant density @xmath2 between 4 and 10kpc .",
    "the increasing of stellar disc thickness along the radius in this galaxy accompanies by the increasing of the surface gas density out of the centre within the wide range of @xmath1 . by this reason this galaxy differs from the others in the diagrams `` @xmath3gas density '' .",
    "the similar abnormal behavior of this galaxy on the kennicutt - schmidt diagram was also revealed by boissier et al .",
    "however the molecular gas density in m  106 behaves in the common manner i.e. steeply decreases with @xmath1 , that explains its `` normal '' position at the diagram @xmath54 .",
    "note , that this galaxy is not typical in other aspects : it differs from the others by the presence of the active nucleus , as well as by the very active star formation in the central part of the disc .",
    "the values of @xmath5 in the schmidt law @xmath55 for the galaxies we consider are rather different ( see table  [ tab4 ] ) .",
    "for all galaxies except m  101 the exponent @xmath56 , and its mean value is close to `` standard''value @xmath57 for `` global''kennicutt - schmidt law ( column ( 3 ) of the table ) .",
    "however , the mean value of @xmath5 approaches unit , if to compare the @xmath10 with the molecular gas density ( column ( 4 ) in the table ) .",
    "the most `` steep '' relationships @xmath58 are obtained for m  33 , m  81 and the galaxy . in the case of m  33",
    "it is caused by the steep decreasing of the @xmath3 with the galactocentric distance ( see figure  [ fig8 ] ) . in the case of m  81 , it is the consequence of the atypically slow decrease of the gas volume density along @xmath1 ( see figure  [ fig3 ] ) when the radial gradient of @xmath3 is moderate . for these three galaxies ,",
    "the exponent @xmath5 is close to the `` classical''value @xmath59 , suggested earlier by schmidt .    in conclusion ,",
    "parameter @xmath5 by no means can be considered as a universal one .",
    "the schmidt law has a very approximate nature , and it fulfils much better when the volume instead of the surface gas density is used . in this case the exponent @xmath60 ( with some possible exceptions ) .",
    "it is important that in spite of a large dispersion its value becomes closer to unit in the mean if to replace the total gas density @xmath2 with the molecular gas density @xmath61 .",
    "it is evident that relationship between the volume gas density and @xmath3 for galaxies should not be too tight because the process of star formation depends on a number of parameters besides the mean gas density .",
    "the latter seems to be a crucial factor only for the most dense gas such as the gas in the nuclei of molecular clouds where the hcn radiation comes from .",
    "indeed , as observations show , the star formation rate depends linearly on the gas mass determined by the hcn line intensity , i.e for the most dense molecular gas @xmath62 ( gao and solomon ,  @xcite ) . although the number of galaxies we considered is small ,",
    "the results allow to propose that the value of @xmath5 is on average close to unit even for the less dense molecular gas , that reveals itself in co line .",
    "since @xmath56 for the total ( @xmath63 ) gas density , one may conclude that not only star formation rate , but also the efficiency of star formation ( @xmath3 per gas mass unit ) decreases along with @xmath2 .",
    "in other words , the less is the gas density , the longer time the gas remains in the rarified atomic state ( that is a time scale of gas consumption is larger ) .",
    "it agrees with general conception , according to which the fraction of the interstellar gas which takes active part in the process of a star formation , decreases when the mean total density of gas becomes lower ( see the discussion in  @xcite ) .",
    "the other important factor , besides the gas density , that determines the star formation rate at a given radius @xmath1 is the surface density of the old stellar disc @xmath64 ( see papers  @xcite ) . as it was shown by zasov and abramova  @xcite on the example of four well - studied galaxies , local star formation efficiency defined as @xmath65/@xmath66 changes approximately as @xmath67 in a wide interval of @xmath1 .",
    "partially this relationship may be explained by higher volume gas density ( for a given surface density ) in those regions , where @xmath64 is higher ( that is closer to galaxy center ) .",
    "nevertheless this relationship can not be reduced to the simple exponential schmidt law ( neither `` volume '' nor `` surface '' one ) because the clearly defined relationship between the gas density and surface disc density is absent .",
    "it evidences the existence of more deep connection between the present - day star formation on the one hand and already formed stellar disc and the gas density on the other hand , which can not be described by simple empiric laws ."
