    "at least 10% of all neutron stars are born as magnetars , with magnetic fields @xmath5  g. their activity is powered by the decay of the ultrastrong field and lasts about @xmath6  years .",
    "they are observed at this active stage as either soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) or anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) @xcite . besides the sporadic x - ray outbursts , a second , persistent",
    ", form of activity has been discovered by studying the emission spectra of magnetars . until recently ,",
    "the spectrum was known to have a thermal component with temperature @xmath7  kev , interpreted as blackbody emission from the star s surface .",
    "the soft x - ray spectrum also showed a tail at @xmath8  kev with photon index @xmath9 .",
    "this deviation from pure surface emission already suggested that energy is partially released above the star s surface .",
    "recently , observations by rxte and integral have revealed even more intriguing feature : magnetars are bright , persistent sources of 100 kev x - rays @xcite .",
    "this high - energy emission forms a separate component of the magnetar spectrum .",
    "it becomes dominant above 10  kev , has a very hard spectrum , @xmath10 , and peaks above 100  kev where the spectrum is unknown .",
    "its luminosity , @xmath11  erg  s@xmath12 , even exceeds the thermal luminosity from the star s surface .",
    "the observed hard x - rays can be emitted only in the exterior of the star and demonstrate the presence of an active plasma corona .",
    "this corona can form as a result of starquakes that shear the magnetar crust and its external magnetic field .",
    "the persistence of magnetospheric twists can explain several observed properties of magnetars .",
    "thompson , lyutikov , & kulkarni  @xcite investigated the observational consequences using a static , force - free model , idealizing the magnetosphere as a globally twisted dipole .",
    "they showed that a twist affects the spindown rate of the neutron star : it causes the magnetosphere to flare out slightly from a pure dipole configuration , thereby increasing the braking torque acting on the star .",
    "although the calculations of force - free configurations are independent of the plasma behavior in the magnetosphere , they rely on the presence of plasma that can conduct the required current @xmath13 .",
    "this requires a minimum particle density @xmath14 .",
    "thompson et al .",
    "@xcite showed that even this minimum density can modify the stellar radiation by multiple resonant scattering .",
    "the problem of plasma dynamics in the closed twisted magnetosphere has been formulated in @xcite , and a simple solution has been found to this problem .",
    "it allows one to understand the observed energy output of the magnetar corona and the evolution of magnetic twists .",
    "it is worth mentioning that plasma behavior around neutron stars has been studied for decades in the context of radio pulsars , and that problem remains unsolved .",
    "the principle difference with radio pulsars is that their activity is caused by _",
    "rotation _ , and dissipation occurs on _ open magnetic lines _ that connect the star to its light cylinder .",
    "electron - positron pairs are then created on open field lines @xcite . by contrast , the formation of a corona around a magnetar does not depend on its rotation . all observed magnetars are slow rotators ( @xmath15  hz ) , and their rotational energy is unable to feed the observed coronal emission .",
    "practically the entire plasma corona is immersed in the _ closed _ magnetosphere and its heating must be caused by some form of dissipation on the closed field lines .",
    "it is this closure that facilitates the corona problem by providing both boundary conditions at the two footpoints of a field line .",
    "the basic questions that one would like to answer are as follows .",
    "how is the magnetosphere populated with plasma ?",
    "the neutron star surface has a temperature @xmath16  kev and the scale - height of its atmospheric layer ( if it exists ) is only a few cm .",
    "how is the plasma supplied above this layer and what type of particles populate the corona",
    "? how is the corona heated , and what are the typical energies of the particles ?",
    "if the corona conducts a current associated with a magnetic twist @xmath17 , how rapid is the dissipation of this current , i.e. what is the lifetime of the twist ? does its decay imply the disappearance of the corona ?",
    "an outline of the proposed model is as follows .",
    "the key agent in corona formation is an electric field @xmath18 parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "@xmath18 is generated by the self - induction of the gradually decaying current and in essence measures the rate of the decay .",
    "it determines the heating rate of the corona via joule dissipation . if @xmath19 then the corona is not heated and , being in contact with the cool stellar surface , it will have to condense to a thin surface layer with @xmath16  kev .",
    "the current - carrying particles can not flow upward against gravity unless a force @xmath20 drives it . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath18 exceeds a critical value , @xmath21 avalanches are triggered in the magnetosphere , and the created pairs screen the electric field .",
    "this leads to a `` bottleneck '' for the decay of a magnetic twist , which implies a slow decay .",
    "maintenance of the corona and the slow decay of the magnetic twist are intimately related because both are governed by @xmath18 . in order to find @xmath18",
    ", one can use gauss law @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the net charge density of the coronal plasma .",
    "this constraint implies that @xmath24 and @xmath23 must be found self - consistently .",
    "the problem turns out to be similar to the classical double - layer problem of plasma physics with a new essential ingredient : @xmath21 creation .",
    "a direct numerical experiment can be designed that simulates the creation and behavior of the plasma in the magnetosphere .",
    "the experiment shows how the plasma and electric field self - organize to maintain the time - average magnetospheric current @xmath25 demanded by the magnetic field , @xmath26 .",
    "the electric current admits no steady state on short timescales and keeps fluctuating , producing @xmath21 avalanches .",
    "this state may be described as a self - organized criticality .",
    "pair creation is found to provide a robust mechanism for limiting the voltage along the magnetic lines to @xmath27  gev and regulate the observed luminosity of the corona .",
    "a tightly wound - up magnetic field is assumed to exist inside magnetars @xcite .",
    "the internal toroidal field can be much stronger than the external large - scale dipole component .",
    "the essence of magnetar activity is the transfer of magnetic helicity from the interior of the star to its exterior , where it dissipates .",
    "this involves rotational motions of the crust , which inevitably twist the external magnetosphere anchored to the stellar surface .",
    "the magnetosphere is probably twisted in a catastrophic way , when the internal magnetic field breaks the crust and rotates it .",
    "such starquakes are associated with observed x - ray bursts @xcite .",
    "the most interesting effect of a starquake for us here is the partial release of the winding of the internal magnetic field into the exterior , i.e. , the injection of magnetic helicity into the magnetosphere .",
    "since the magnetic field is energetically dominant in the magnetosphere , it must relax there to a force - free configuration with @xmath28 .",
    "electric current @xmath29 initiated by a starquake flows along the magnetic field lines to the exterior of the star , reaches the top of the field line , and comes back to the star at the other footpoint , then enters the atmosphere and the crust , following the magnetic field lines ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "sufficiently deep in the crust the current flows across the field lines and changes direction so that it can flow back to the twisted footpoint through the magnetosphere ( or directly through the star , depending on the geometry of the twist ) .",
    "the current can flow across the field lines in the deep crust because it is able to sustain a significant ampre force @xmath31  this force is balanced by elastic forces of the deformed crust .",
    "the emerging currents are easily maintained during the x - ray outburst accompanying a starquake .",
    "a dense , thermalized plasma is then present in the magnetosphere , which easily conducts the current .",
    "plasma remains suspended for some time after the starquake because of the transient thermal afterglow @xcite .",
    "eventually the afterglow extinguishes and the radiative flux becomes unable to support the plasma outside the star .",
    "the decreasing density then threats the capability of the magnetosphere to conduct the current of the magnetic twist . a minimal `` corotation '' charge density @xmath32 is always maintained @xcite , but it is far smaller than needed to supply the current @xmath33 .",
    "can the lack of charges stop the flow of electric current ?",
    "a simple estimate shows that the current can not stop quickly because of its self - induction . a slow decay of the current generates a sufficient self - induction voltage that helps the magnetosphere to re - generate the plasma that carries the current , so that the twisted force - free configuration persists with a qausi - steady @xmath34 .",
    "the stored energy of non - potential ( toroidal ) magnetic field associated with the ejected current is subject to gradual dissipation . in our model",
    ", this dissipation feeds the observed activity of the corona .",
    "the stored energy is concentrated near the star and carried by closed magnetic lines with a maximum extension radius @xmath35 .",
    "thus , most of the twist energy will be released if these lines untwist , and we focus here on the near magnetosphere @xmath35 .",
    "consider a magnetic flux tube with cross section @xmath36 and length @xmath37 which carries a current @xmath38 .",
    "the stored magnetic energy of the current per unit length of the tube is ~ s. the decay of this energy is associated with an electric field parallel to the magnetic lines @xmath39 : this field can accelerate particles and convert the magnetic energy into plasma energy .",
    "conservation of energy can be expressed as ( ) = - -(c ) , as follows from maxwell s equations with @xmath40 .",

    "the second term  the divergence of the poynting flux  vanishes for the induced field @xmath41 .",
    "is a few cm.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    the decay of the twist is related to the voltage between the footpoints of a magnetic line , [ eq : phi_e ] _",
    "e=_a^c e. here a and c are the anode and cathode footpoints and @xmath42 is the line element ; the integral is taken along the magnetic line outside the star ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the product @xmath43 approximately represents the dissipation rate @xmath44 in the tube .",
    "( the two quantities are not exactly equal in a time - dependent circuit . )",
    "the instantaneous dissipation rate is given by = _",
    "a^c e(l ) , where @xmath45 is the instantaneous current at position @xmath46 in the tube .",
    "the current is fixed at footpoints a and c , @xmath47 ; it may , however , fluctuate between the footpoints .",
    "the voltage @xmath48 is entirely maintained by the self - induction that accompanies the gradual untwisting of the magnetic field .",
    "thus , @xmath48 reflects the gradual decrease of the magnetic helicity in the tube , = t_a^c * a * v = -_a^c * eb * s(l ) l. ( here @xmath49 is the volume element . ) it also determines the effective resistivity of the tube : @xmath50 .",
    "the self - induction voltage passes the released magnetic energy to charged particles , and a higher rate of untwisting implies a higher energy @xmath51 gained per particle .",
    "a huge magnetic energy is stored in the twisted tube , and a quick untwisting would lead to extremely high lorentz factors of the accelerated particles .",
    "there is , however , a bottleneck that prevents a fast decay of the twist : the tube responds to high voltages through the copious production of @xmath21 pairs .",
    "runaway pair creation is ignited when electrons are accelerated to a certain lorentz factor @xmath52 ( see below ) .",
    "the created @xmath21 plasma does not tolerate large @xmath18  the plasma is immediately polarized , screening the electric field .",
    "this provides a negative feedback that limits the magnitude of @xmath48 and buffers the decay of the twist .",
    "a minimum @xmath48 is needed for the formation of a corona .",
    "two mechanisms can supply plasma : ( 1 ) ions and electrons can be lifted into the magnetosphere from the stellar surface .",
    "this requires a minimum voltage , e_e ~gm_i r_ns ~200 , corresponding to @xmath18 that is strong enough to lift ions ( of mass @xmath53 ) from the anode footpoint and electrons from the cathode footpoint .",
    "( 2 ) pairs can be created in the magnetosphere if e_e ~_mc^2 = 0.5 _ , which can accelerate particles to the lorentz factor @xmath54 sufficient to ignite @xmath21 creation .",
    "if @xmath48 is too low and the plasma is not supplied , a flux tube is guaranteed to generate a stronger electric field . the current becomes slightly charge - starved : that is , the net density of free charges becomes smaller than @xmath55 .",
    "the ultrastrong magnetic field , whose twist carries an enormous energy compared with the energy of the plasma , does not change and responds to the decrease of @xmath29 by generating an electric field : a small reduction of the conduction current @xmath29 induces a displacement current @xmath56 .",
    "the longitudinal electric field @xmath18 then quickly grows until it can pull particles away from the stellar surface and ignite pair creation .",
    "the limiting cases @xmath57 ( no decay of the twist ) and @xmath58 ( fast decay ) both imply a contradiction . the electric field and",
    "the plasma content of the corona must regulate each other toward a self - consistent state , and the gradual decay of the twist proceeds through a delicate balance : @xmath18 must be strong enough to supply plasma and maintain the current in the corona ; however , if plasma is oversupplied @xmath18 will be reduced by screening . a cyclic behavior is possible , in which plasma is periodically oversupplied and @xmath18 is screened .",
    "our numerical experiment shows that such a cyclic behavior indeed takes place .",
    "three facts facilitate the simulation of the coronal electric circuit :    \\1 .",
    "the ultrastrong magnetic field makes the particle dynamics 1-d .",
    "the magnetic field lines are not perturbed significantly by the plasma inertia , and they can be thought of as fixed `` rails '' along which the particles move .",
    "the particle motion is confined to the lowest landau level and is strictly parallel to the field ( the lifetime of a particle in an excited landau state is tiny ) .",
    "the particle motion is collisionless in the magnetosphere .",
    "it is governed by two forces only : the component of gravity projected onto the magnetic field and a collective electric field @xmath18 which is determined by the charge density distribution and must be found self - consistently .",
    "the star possesses a dense and thin atmospheric layer . near the base of the atmosphere ,",
    "the required current @xmath59 is easily conducted , with almost no electric field .",
    "therefore the circuit has simple boundary conditions : @xmath19 and fixed current .",
    "the atmosphere is much thicker than the skin depth of the plasma and screens the magnetospheric electric field from the star .",
    "our goal is to understand the plasma behavior above the screening layer , where the atmospheric density is exponentially reduced and an electric field @xmath18 must develop .",
    "the induced electric field @xmath24 and conduction current @xmath29 satisfy the maxwell equation , [ eq : maxw _ ] = + . here",
    "@xmath29 is parallel to the direction of the magnetic field , and the force - free condition requires @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , in the fixed magnetic configuration where @xmath61 does not vary with time , @xmath62 is parallel to @xmath63 , i.e. only @xmath18 is created by the self - iduction effect .",
    "we consider a simple model problem where no pre - existing perpendicular field @xmath64 exists ; more precisely , we require @xmath65 .",
    "then gauss law reads [ eq : gauss1 ] 4=_= , where @xmath46 is length measured along the magnetic tube .",
    "then the problem becomes strictly 1-d since @xmath64 has no relation to charge density and falls out from the problem .",
    "note that the approximation of 1d circuit , @xmath66 , where @xmath67 , excludes the excitation of transverse waves in the magnetosphere , which in reality can exist .",
    "these waves are described by the coupled fluctuations @xmath68 and @xmath64 on scales much smaller than the circuit size @xmath69 .",
    "( wavelengths @xmath70 can be excited by plasma oscillations . )",
    "these fluctuations may be expected to have a small effect on the circuit solution unless @xmath68 becomes comparable to @xmath71 .    with @xmath66 ,",
    "the particle motions on different magnetic lines are decoupled .",
    "indeed , the particle dynamics is controlled by electric field @xmath72 which is related to the instantaneous charge distribution by gauss law ( [ eq : gauss1 ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath73 on a given magnetic line is fully determined by charge density @xmath74 _ on the same line_. the plasma and electric field evolve along the line as if the world were 1-d .",
    "if the conduction current @xmath75 is smaller than @xmath71 , then @xmath76 and an electric field appears that tends to increase the current . alternatively , if @xmath77 then an electric field of the opposite sign develops which tends to reduce the current .",
    "thus , @xmath75 is always regulated toward @xmath78 .",
    "this is the standard self - induction effect .",
    "the timescale of the regulation , @xmath79 , is very short , of the order of the langmuir oscillation timescale @xmath80  s. local deviations from charge neutrality tend to be erased on the same plasma timescale .",
    "the net charge imbalance of the corona must be extremely small  a tiny imbalance would create an electric field that easily pulls out the missing charges from the surface . when the corotation charge density is neglected , the net charge of the corona vanishes .    adopting a characteristic velocity @xmath81 of the coronal particles , the debye length of the plasma @xmath82",
    "can be taken equal to the plasma skin depth @xmath83 .",
    "an important physical parameter of the corona is the ratio of the debye length to the circuit size @xmath37 , [ eq : zeta ] = = 1 .",
    "the force - free condition @xmath84 together with @xmath85 requires that @xmath86 along the magnetic line .",
    "we can scale out this variation simply dividing all local quantities ( charge density , current density , and electric field ) by @xmath87 .",

    "the calculated @xmath149  gev implies [ eq : ldiss ] l_diss = i_e~10 ^ 37b_15 ( ) ^2 ( ) . observed luminosity @xmath150  erg  s@xmath12 is consistent with a partially twisted magnetosphere , @xmath151 , or a global moderate twist with @xmath152 .",
    "once created , a magnetospheric twist has a relatively long but finite lifetime .",
    "the energy stored in it is @xmath153 .",
    "this energy dissipates in a time @xmath154 note that a stronger twist ( brighter corona ) lives longer .",
    "if the time between large - scale starquakes is longer than @xmath155 , the magnetar should be seen to enter a quiescent state .",
    "such behavior has been observed in axp  j1810 - 197 : an outburst was followed by the gradual decay on a year timescale @xcite .",
    "the voltage @xmath48 implies a certain effective resistivity of the corona , @xmath50 .",
    "this resistivity leads to spreading of the electric current _ across _ the magnetic lines , which is described by the induction equation @xmath156 .",
    "the timescale of twist spreading to the light cylinder is comparable to @xmath155 .",
    "therefore , the impact of a starquake on spindown may appear with a delay of @xmath157 years .",
    "even a small ion current implies a large mass transfer through the magnetosphere over the @xmath158-yr active lifetime of a magnetar .",
    "it requires a significant excavation of the crust at the anode footpoints of twisted magnetic tubes .",
    "the bombarding relativistic electrons from the corona cause this excavation .",
    "they spall heavy ions in the uppermost crust , re - generate the light - element atmosphere on the surface , and regulate its column density to a value @xmath159 @xcite .    the radiative output from the corona likely peaks in its inner region because the coronal current is concentrated on closed field lines with a maximum extension @xmath160 (   2 ) .",
    "emission from the inner corona must be suppressed above @xmath3  mev , regardless the mechanism of emission , because photons with energy @xmath161  mev can not escape the ultra - strong magnetic field .",
    "the observed high - energy radiation extends above 100  kev @xcite .",
    "there is an indication for a cutoff between 200  kev and 1  mev from comptel upper limits for axp 4u 0142@xmath16261",
    ".    the possible mechanisms of emission are strongly constrained .",
    "the corona has a low density @xmath163  @xmath164 and particle collisions are rare , so two - body radiative processes are negligible .",
    "the upscattering of kev photons streaming from the surface does not explain the observed 100-kev emission @xcite .",
    "a possible source of the 100  kev x - rays is the transition layer between the corona and the thermal photosphere @xcite .",
    "it is heated by the coronal beam and cooled by heat conduction toward the surface , and its temperature is regulated to @xmath165  kev , where @xmath166 parameterizes the suppression of thermal conductivity by plasma turbulence .",
    "the emitted x - ray spectrum may be approximated as single - temperature optically thin bremsstrahlung @xcite .",
    "its photon index below the exponential cutoff is close to @xmath167 , in agreement with spectra observed with integral and rxte .",
    "the observed pulsed fraction increases toward the high - energy end of the spectrum and approaches 100% at 100  kev ( kuiper et al .",
    "if the hard x - rays are produced by one or two twisted spots on the star surface , the large pulsed fraction implies that the spots almost disappear during some phase of rotation",
    ". then they should not be too far from each other .",
    "they can not be , e.g. , antipodal because a large fraction of the star surface is visible to observer due to the gravitational bending of light : @xmath168 @xcite .",
    "the transition layer at a footprint of a coronal flux tube may reach high enough temperature for thermal @xmath21 production @xcite .",
    "the created pairs then elevate above the surface and can conduct the magnetospheric current .",
    "this opens a possibility for the corona to be fed by surface pair creation instead of the @xmath21 discharge .",
    "the observed infrared ( @xmath169-band ) and optical luminosities of magnetars are @xmath170  erg / s @xcite , which is far above the rayleigh - jeans tail of the surface blackbody radiation .",
    "the inferred brightness temperature is @xmath171  k if the radiation is emitted from the surface of the star .",
    "four principle emission mechanisms may then be considered : coherent plasma emission , synchrotron emission by electrons , cyclotron emission by ions , and curvature radiation by @xmath21 bunches in the corona .",
    "the last two are most plausible ( see @xcite for detailed discussion ) .",
    "in particular , curvature radiation in the inner magnetosphere may extend into the optical - ir range .",
    "charges moving on field lines with a curvature radius @xmath172 will emit radiation with frequency @xmath173 , which is in the k - band ( @xmath174  hz ) or optical when @xmath175  gev .",
    "the radio luminosity of a normal pulsar can approach @xmath176 of its spindown power , and it is not implausible that the observed fraction @xmath2 of the power dissipated in a magnetar corona is radiated in optical - ir photons by the same coherent mechanism .",
    "the corona luminosity is simply proportional to the net current flowing through the magnetosphere , and is determined by the competition between occasional twisting ( due to starquakes ) and gradual dissipative untwisting of the magnetosphere . during periods of high activity ,",
    "when starquakes occur frequently , the magnetospheric twist may grow to the point of a global instability : when a critical @xmath177 is achieved , the magnetosphere suddenly relaxes to a smaller twist angle .",
    "a huge release of energy must then occur , producing a giant flare ; a model of how this can happen is discussed in @xcite .    a possible way to probe",
    "the twist evolution is to measure the history of spindown rate @xmath178 of the magnetar .",
    "the existing data confirm the theoretical expectations : the spin - down of sgrs was observed to accelerate months to years following periods of activity @xcite .",
    "a similar effect was also observed following flux enhancement in axps @xcite .",
    "this `` hysteresis '' behavior of the spindown rate may represent the delay with which the twist is spreading to the outer magnetosphere .    since the density of the plasma corona is proportional to the current that flows through it , changes in the twist also lead to changes in the coronal opacity .",
    "the density of the plasma corona is close to its minimum @xmath179 , and it is largely made of @xmath21 pairs rather than electron - ion plasma .",
    "the opacity should increase following bursts of activity and affect the x - ray pulse profile and spectrum .",
    "such changes , which persist for months to years , have been observed following x - ray outbursts from two sgrs @xcite ."
