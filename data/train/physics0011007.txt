    "several measurements of the parity violating component in the nucleon - nucleon interaction have been reported over the years @xcite",
    "@xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite , achieving greater precision over time .",
    "such an experiment that aims to measure longitudinal analyzing power , @xmath1 , to a precision of @xmath2 ( in statistics and systematics ) is underway at triumf @xcite .",
    "other experimenters have measured the same quantity with protons incident on light nuclei @xcite @xcite .",
    "the triumf experiment is unique in that it seeks to measure the parity - violating effect at an energy , 221 mev , where the leading term ( which dominates below 100 mev ) , @xmath3 , is zero ( averaged over the acceptance of the detector ) , thus observing the @xmath4 term as the dominant component @xcite .",
    "the difference in these terms is that they are dependent on different combinations of the weak meson couplings @xcite .",
    "in addition , another experiment is planned at 450 mev at triumf @xcite .",
    "initially , it was recognized that residual transverse components of polarization which changed sign with the longitudinal component of polarization gave rise to a systematic error if the detection system was asymmetric or if the incident proton beam were off the symmetry axis @xcite .",
    "later , it was recognized that even if the transverse polarization components of a finite - sized beam averaged to zero , an inhomogeneous distribution of the transverse polarization over the beam profile could result in a significant contribution to the measured @xmath1 @xcite @xcite .",
    "the eth - sin - zrich - karlsruhe - wisconsin group @xcite @xcite describe a beam intensity / polarization profile monitor @xcite that operates with two wheels ( _ x _ and _ y _ ) each driving two graphite targets through their 50 mev proton beam .",
    "protons scattered at @xmath5 , near the maximum of the @xmath6 analyzing power , were observed in four scintillators left , right , bottom and top , and timed with respect to a reference on the wheel , i.e. the position of the target for that scattered proton .",
    "the data , along with information about the spin state , were read into a series of spectra from which intensity and polarization profiles could be deduced .",
    "they used two such devices in their beamline .",
    "this polarimeter is also described modified for use at lower energies @xcite .",
    "the targets used were much thinner and they adapted a multi - channel scaler and multi - channel analyzer to record and store the profiles .",
    "the bonn group @xcite describe a beam profile scanner that measures polarization @xcite by physically moving a polarimeter ( one for vertical and one for horizontal profile ) with a thin graphite target through the beam .",
    "the target is optimized to allow passage of one target at a time through the beam while data collection is enabled .",
    "they detected protons scattered at @xmath7 .",
    "an elastically scattered proton in any of four si detectors generated a sampling of an adc that read a voltage picked up from a linear potentiometer related to the device s position .",
    "again , position dependent spectra were generated from which intensity and polarization profiles can be deduced .",
    "they also used two such devices in their beamline .",
    "the los alamos - illinois group @xcite @xcite describe a simple scanning target used in a conventional polarimeter .",
    "requirements of the triumf parity experiment are that it be able to intimately ( i.e. , within the data collection cycles of the experiment , each cycle being eight periods of 25 ms duration ) monitor the profile of the transverse polarization components as a function of position ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) , and that one be able to determine the corrections derived therefrom to @xmath1 to a level at or below @xmath10 over the whole data collection period ( several hundred hours not counting calibrations and other overhead ) .",
    "these quantities are the average transverse components of polarization which given an effect proportional to displacement from the detector symmetry axis , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and the intrinsic first moments of polarization , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , which will contribute even if the proton beam is perfectly aligned with the apparatus .",
    "higher order terms and in - plane terms ( such as @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) should be negligible @xcite @xcite .",
    "typical run time conditions keep transverse components of polarization under @xmath17 per data run ( typically one hour ) .",
    "intrinsic first moments of transverse polarization are typically within @xmath18 per run .",
    "as mentioned above , some researchers @xcite @xcite @xcite use graphite targets which have relatively high counting rates and high analyzing powers . however , the angular dependence of both cross section and analyzing power and the contribution of inelastic scattering , especially at higher energies , make this undesirable in the present case . by moving the polarimeter detectors rigidly with the target , chlebek et al",
    ". @xcite avoid position correlated acceptance problems . such a device had initially been considered @xcite but abandoned when it became apparent that the higher energy and larger beam size would make such a scheme too unwieldy .",
    "the mechanics of the present detector have been described in @xcite , though there have been modifications since then which will be explained below .",
    "the device is a four - branch polarimeter whose target consists of two wheels that can drive strips ( ` blades ' ) of @xmath19 ( two on each wheel ) through the beam at a speed locked to the experiment cycle time .",
    "it is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "two blades per wheel were chosen as an optimal compromise between polarization measuring time and @xmath1 ( i.e. , experimental determination of the helicity dependent asymmetry of the beam transmission through an @xmath20 target ) measuring time .",
    "two of these detectors are mounted in the experimental beamline to allow for extrapolation of the polarization profiles to the target location .",
    "they are shown in figure  [ fig2 ] . they are upstream of the transverse field ionization chambers ( tric s ) that sandwich the @xmath20 target .",
    "the tric signals ( proportional to the beam current ) determine the parity violating longitudinal analyzing power that is the observable of interest .",
    "each branch consists of a forward arm of two scintillators at @xmath21 from the axis and a recoil arm .",
    "the angle of @xmath21 was chosen as a reasonable compromise near the @xmath22 analyzing power maximum over the energy range at which parity violation may be investigated at triumf , see figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the figure of merit for a polarimeter can be defined as : + @xmath23 this is also shown in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the forward arm consists of two scintillators .",
    "the solid - angle of acceptance for scattered protons is defined by a rotated counter ( @xmath24 ) whose angle of rotation along its axis perpendicular to the scattering plane is chosen to cancel the effect of the change in @xmath22 scattering cross - section and detector geometry with target blade position @xcite . at 223 mev ,",
    "this rotation angle is determined to be @xmath25 with respect to the plane perpendicular to the nominal @xmath21 center - line of the scattered protons , in the direction as shown in figure 4 . between the @xmath24-counter and the target plane is a counter ( @xmath26 ) whose function is to determine that the scattered protons are collinear with the target .",
    "the recoil arm is at @xmath27 at which the recoil protons from @xmath22 scattering will be stopped in the front ( @xmath28 ) counter or in a 1.6 mm thick aluminum shield immediately behind it .",
    "protons from other sources that are too penetrating will pass through and hit the veto ( @xmath29 ) counter immediately behind .",
    "the location and dimensions of each counter are recorded in table  [ tabi ] .",
    "a schematic of a single branch lay - out is given in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    ".ppm scintillator counter dimensions .",
    "distances are from the center of the target plane . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tabii ]    tests were also done with carbon blades replacing the usual @xmath19 blades in the polarimeter .",
    "these indicated that 1% of the true events in the ppm came from the carbon in the @xmath19 blades ( @xmath30 , etc . ) .",
    "this had a very small contribution to the effective analyzing power .",
    "as the data collection involved spin off periods interspersed with the polarized beam , it was possible to monitor the ppm s response ( instrumental asymmetry ) to zero polarization ( ideally what we would like to see in the experiment with a perfect longitudinally polarized beam ) . an instrumental asymmetry as a function of blade position plot",
    "is presented in figure  [ fig8 ] .",
    "it was found that the slope of the instrumental asymmetry was strongly dependent on the divergence or convergence of the beam , as then the angle of incidence is position dependent and the scattering angle dependence on position is different from the assumption of a parallel beam .",
    "note that the requirement for the experiment is for as parallel a beam ( i.e. , very weakly focussed at the target ) as reasonably achievable .",
    "figure  [ fig9 ] shows a helicity - correlated polarization profile measured by the upstream ppm with 200 na beam and a beam size ( @xmath31 ) of 5.0 mm .    under those conditions ,",
    "each ppm measures an average @xmath32 and @xmath33 to @xmath340.002 and @xmath13 and @xmath14 to @xmath347 @xmath35 m in one hour .",
    "the effective analyzing power as a function of blade position is determined by moving the beam across the range of the blade sweep with the beam transversely polarized .",
    "absolute calibration was done by comparing the integrated result to the existing ibp .",
    "the ppm rotation control system has worked very well .",
    "it is convenient to use and normally maintains ppm synchronization to @xmath34 one shaft encoder line .    the ppm s have been successfully used throughout the triumf parity experiment ( e497 ) . for three runs ( not the full data set ) of data taken in 1997 , 1998 and 1999 ( about four months ) consisting of about 240 hours of tric data ( the actual parity violation measurement ) collection : the ` false ' parity violating analyzing power ( @xmath1 ) derived from transverse components of polarization coupled with a displacement from the ideal instrumental symmetry axis has been measured as @xmath36 .",
    "the false @xmath1 derived from the first moments of polarization has been measured as @xmath37 .",
    "this confirms the expectation that the latter is a large ( indeed , so far , the largest ) correction .",
    "it is also the largest contribution to the e497 error .",
    "improved ppm error to total error could be achieved by changing the number of targets ( and thus the ratio of ppm data collection time to tric data collection time ) or seeking some other means of rapidly and accurately measuring the polarization profiles .",
