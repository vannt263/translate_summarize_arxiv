    "one such proposed experiment @xcite envisages reconstructing the 3d structure of a microscopic entity such as a virus from many ultrashort diffraction patterns of many identical copies of the particles in random orientations from single pulses of fel radiation .",
    "although the particles will undoubtedly suffer catastrophic radiation damage , the ultrashort nature of fel radiation is expected to produce diffraction patterns of the particles before significant disintegration .",
    "an experiment on individual mimivirus particles was reported recently @xcite .",
    "the paper illustrates convincing diffraction patterns of the virus particle in two different orientations , from which 2d projections of the particles are reconstructed using an iterative phasing algorithm .",
    "although such particles are known to be largely icosahedral , little evidence of the icosahedral shape is evident in the reconstructed projections .",
    "several algorithms have been proposed for reconstructing a full 3d image of the particle from an ensemble of many such diffraction patterns from randomly oriented particles .",
    "the methodology followed by some of these approaches @xcite is to find the likely orientation of the measured diffraction patterns in the 3d reciprocal space of the particle .",
    "another approach @xcite dispenses with finding the likely orientations of the individual diffraction patterns by integrating over orientations , in an attempt to find the spherical harmonic representation of the 3d diffraction volume of a single particle from the averages of the angular correlations of the intensities on the measured diffraction patterns .",
    "this method of analysis is even applicable to individual diffraction patterns from multiple identical particles @xcite .",
    "the particles need to be frozen in space or time while the scattering is taking place .",
    "if the scattering is from a single fel pulse of radiation , the particles will be essentially frozen in time for the duration of the scattering even if not frozen in space .",
    "this opens this method to the analysis of scattering from particles in random orientations within a droplet .",
    "with such an approach , the `` hit rate '' in an experiment with a fel can become 100% , whereas a low hit rate is to be expected when attempting to hit submicron particles with a submicron pulsed laser beam .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio from such snapshot patterns is independent of the number of particles per shot , but increases with the square root of the number of shots @xcite .",
    "this approach also has the advantage that it operates on a compressed version of the voluminous data produced by a fel .",
    "we point out here another advantage of this approach : it is easily amenable to simplifications resulting from any known point - group symmetry of the particles under study .",
    "this is a powerful advantage for the study of virus structure , which is dominated by that of its protein coat which encloses the genetic material , dna or rna , which contain the instructions for the replication of the virus . to quote from caspar and klug @xcite",
    "`` there are only a limited number of efficient designs possible for a biological container which can be constructed from a large number of identical protein molecules , the two basic designs are helical tubes and icosahedral shells '' .",
    "viruses have regular shapes since they are formed by the self assembly of identical protein subunits which are coded by the limited quantity of genetic material capable of being stored within the small volume enclosed by its protein coat .",
    "an icosahedron , for example can be formed by the self assembly of at least 60 identical subunits .",
    "the genetic material needs to code for just one of these subunits , a factor of at least 60 smaller than the entire structure .",
    "the first aim of this approach is to find the spherical harmonic representation of the intensity distribution of any resolution shell in the reciprocal space of a single particle .",
    "any prior information about the nature of this distribution may be incorporated by limiting the set of spherical harmonics over which the summation is performed and by any relationship amongst the amplitudes of the different spherical harmonics which are a consequence of any known point - group symmetry .",

    "we find that @xmath116 stnv has a radius of @xmath97 100   suggesting a resolution of about 20  . in practice we found that increasing @xmath57 a further 50% or so , while keeping @xmath111 fixed at 30 seemed to improve the quality of the reconstructed image .",
    "presumably because up to about 1.5@xmath57 the spherical harmonic expansion coefficients of @xmath2 greater than 30 remain small",
    ".    it should be emphasized this is not necessarily an absolute limit of the resolution obtainable with the use of icosahedral harmonics .",
    "the higher order harmonics , at least up to @xmath2=44 , have been tabulated by zheng _",
    "at least up to this value , the degeneracy of the icosahedral harmonics characterized by a particular value of @xmath2 is no more than two .",
    "although the algorithm for recovering the expansion coefficients of such degenerate hamonics from the experimental data is a little more complicated , it seems far from an insuperable problem .    the images in figs .",
    "[ direct ] to [ reconstr ] were computed by an iterative phasing algorithm @xcite from a reciprocal - space distribution of intensities oversampled @xcite by a factor of @xmath97 2 with respect to the size of stnv , up to a @xmath57 value of @xmath97 0.47 @xmath100 ( a 61@xmath9861@xmath9861 array ) , implying a resolution of about 13  , and a @xmath117 ratio closer to @xmath118 .",
    "further , the images of fig .",
    "[ direct]-[cutout ] reveal this coat to be hollow .",
    "the slice ( fig .",
    "[ cutout ] ) through the reconstructed image perpendicular to the 5-fold axis reveals both external and internal surfaces of 5-fold rotational symmetry .",
    "the revelation of the hollow nature of the protein coat is of course an extra feature contained in the 3d intensity distribution above and beyond the assumed icosahedral symmetry .",
    "it is revealed by the iterative reconstruction algorithm used @xcite due to the paricular variation of the @xmath40 coefficients with the radial reciprocal - space coordinates @xmath48 and @xmath58 .",
    "some the advantages of this method of analysis of single particle diffraction patterns from unknown particle orientations compared with other proposed algorithms @xcite should be pointed out . since it has been shown @xcite , that the angular correlations of multiple identical particles in arbitrary orientations are essentially identical to those from a single particle , the method we have described is equally applicable to droplets containing multiple particles injected into the xfel @xcite as to the injection of single particles in random orientations .",
    "thus there is no need to discard diffraction patterns from multiple particle hits .    since the inputs to our algorithm are not the direct photon counts , but rather the average of the angular correlations between intensities of the _ same _ diffraction patterns , it is insensitive to shot - to - shot fluctuations between the diffraction patterns , as may be caused by intensity variations of the incident x - ray beam or , for example , by the number of particles scattering a particular x - ray pulse .",
    "the raw experimental data is likely to consist of @xmath97 10@xmath119 diffraction patterns , each of @xmath97 10@xmath119 pixels .",
    "thus the raw experimental data will require tb of storage .",
    "of course , this is very noisy data , and the structural information content is much less than this .",
    "the averaging of the angular correlations that we perform may be regarded as a form of data averaging that results in infomormation concentration and noise reduction .",
    "even if the number of values of q chosen is , say , 61 , and these coefficeints are evaluated for , say , 30 values of @xmath2 , the total number of these ( real ) coefficients will be only of the order of 100,000 , requiring less than a mb of storage .",
    "this data reduction is best performed at the site of the data to allow the tranference of a million times less data over the internet to the site of image reconstruction .",
    "the reconstruction of 3d images of the quality of figs . 8 - 10 from a properly constructed set of @xmath40 coefficients is extraordinarily rapid . in our calculations ,",
    "reconstruction of an array of @xmath101 values representing a 3d diffraction volume at reciprocal - space coordinates @xmath102 on a 61@xmath9861@xmath9861 cartesian grid took just a few seconds on a single intel q6600 processor , using an intel fortran compiler .",
    "the reconstruction of real - space images of the quality of figs . 8 - 10 from this array by means of a `` charge flipping '' algorithm @xcite took a further 4 minutes for 200 iterations on a laptop pc .",
    "of course , the averaging of the data from the different diffraction pattterns assumes they all arise from copies of the particle in different orientations ( as does the technique of small angle x - ray scattering , saxs , for example ) . in order to distinguish between different conformations of the individual molecules",
    ", it may be necessary to operate on the entire ensemble of all the measured diffraction patterns one of the disadvantages of such methods is the need to operate on single - particle diffraction patterns and thus , unlike with our method , diffraction patterns from multiple hits need to be removed .",
    "such methods also face the problem of the uncertain normalization of incident intensities between successive pulses of incident radiation .",
    "also , in contrast to our method , such techniques may require the tranferance of perhaps tb of data over the internet to the site of the data performing the analysis , which needs to be equipped with a cluster of computers performing parallel computations .",
    "when reconstructing the structure of a virus from `` diffract and destroy '' type single - particle diffraction experiments proposed for the free electron laser @xcite , one may exploit the dictum of caspar and klug @xcite that `` there are only a limited number of efficient designs possible for a biological container which can be constructed from a large number of identical protein molecules , the two basic designs are helical tubes and icosahedral shells '' .",
    "we offer here a solution for the case of icosahedral viruses . for those viruses which are substantially , though not completely icosahedral",
    ", the method proposed is expected to be useful nontheless for initially reconstructing the approximate icosahedral structure .",
    "the deviations from this structure can then be found by a perturbation theory which does not impose this symmetry .",
    "the input to the algorithm is data from diffraction patterns of randomly oriented identical particles ( where the particle orientations are unknown ) in the form of the average of the angular correlations . as a consequence of any approximate icosahedral symmetry of the scattering particles ,",
    "the angular momentum decomposition of the angular correlations contains only a few dominant contibutions from low values of the angular momenta .",
    "this immediately suggests a simple test of whether the experimentally measured data are from the scattering by an icosahedral object .",
    "if so , the components of the quantities @xmath40 , derivable from the angular correlations , should have much smaller values for @xmath2=1,2,3,4 , and 5 than for @xmath2=0 and @xmath2=6 , for example .",
    "what is more , as we have shown in this paper , the coefficients @xmath46 of the icosahedral harmonic expansion of the 3d diffraction volume of the particle may be derived from the @xmath40 data and a positivity condition on the intensities of the 3d diffraction volume",
    ". this will be the case even if the individual diffraction patterns are a result of scattering from more than one particle , so there will be no need to discard the diffraction patterns from multiple particles .",
    "having obtained the coefficients of an icosahedral harmonic expansion , the 3d diffraction volume may be reconstructed as a sum over these icosahedral harmonics . by definition , the resulting diffraction volume will have icosahedral symmetry .",
    "if this is constructed at a grid that is oversampled by a factor of 2 in each dimension , we have shown that a `` charge flipping '' algorithm with no fixed support contraint is able to reconstruct a 3d image of the particle .",
    "we find that this procedure not only reconstructs an icosahedral shape for the particle , in simulations for the satellite tobacco necrosis virus ( stnv ) it even reveals the hollow nature of the protein coat ."
