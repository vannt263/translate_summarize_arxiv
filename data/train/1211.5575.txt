    "macroeconomic agent - based models are a relatively young strand of research @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "they allow to propose microscopic underlying mechanisms that lead to empirically observed statistical regularities of a macroeconomy , which models starting directly on the aggregate level can not provide .",
    "they avoid the so - called  fallacy of composition  , since they allow to study interactions .",
    "macroeconomic agent - based models are often conserving the flow of funds , i.e. they can serve as a tool to study the role of debt levels , interest flows , or availability of credit on economic activity .",
    "the most important implication of this stock - flow consistency is that the financial condition of agents plays a central role determining their actions . in that sense ,",
    "stock - flow consistent models provide an alternative to efficient markets as a guiding principle of an economic model , where `` the impact of the flow of funds and the stocks of credit and debt are fully reflected in returns and risks at the individual level''@xcite . if , in contrast , agents base their decisions only on their balance sheet , and do not know the financial condition of others , systemic risk can be present .",
    "stock - flow consistent models use as main principle the conservation of money .",
    "they can be agent - based , such as @xcite,@xcite and this model , or analytical .",
    "several analytical stock - flow consistent models describe the money flows between sectors @xcite , @xcite .",
    "they exhibit steady state scenarios where the money flows to and from each sector add to zero .",
    "this implies that , if the model is discrete in time , in one iteration every actor needs to re - inject in the system the money he has received , be it wages , profits or interest payments .",
    "if this does not happen , economic activity will eventually cease .",
    "regarding enterprises , this phenomenon has become known as the ` paradox of monetary profits ' @xcite , originally formulated by marx , stating that enterprises can at most earn what they have paid in wages . to circumvent this , other models introduce as money flows interest payments of enterprises to the bank , which is a joint stock company and distributes a dividend @xcite , consumption of the bank @xcite , or dividends of enterprises who are joint - stock companies @xcite .",
    "the stock - flow consistent model proposed here avoids the paradox of monetary profits because enterprises spend a part of their gross profits to pay interests on debts to the bank , and the rest in the goods market .",
    "the bank who is the recipient of the interest payments will bear losses from loans that are not reimbursed whenever an enterprise goes bankrupt . as the simulations show , in the latter case , money flows do not equal within one iteration , since the accumulation of debts goes over many iterations . on the long term , each sector will re - inject what he has received , but this steady state exhibits fluctuations whose strength depends on the parameters of the system .    a major difference to analytical stock - flow consistent models is that agent - based macroeconomic models allow for the description of competition all markets . @xcite and",
    "@xcite use a price mechanism in the goods market , the job market and the credit market . in the model proposed in this paper",
    ", competition of enterprises does not happen via prices but due to limited quantities .",
    "enterprises compete for the available amount of workers in the job market , and for aggregate demand in the goods market respectively .",
    "these market allocations introduce a stochastic term in the dynamics of the system . in order to be able describe the arising stochastic model",
    "theoretically , it needs to be simpler than the scenario presented in this paper .",
    "in his paper on the history of growth models , j. sutton revealed two aspects limiting the use of such simple models @xcite : in the past many purely stochastic models had been presented , which do not attribute any importance to the purposeful behaviour of agents .",
    "this has been seen as a flaw by many economists , who turned towards game - theoretic approaches .",
    "secondly , it can be difficult to interpret models with very general assumptions . this paper takes a different approach : it combines the well - understood stochastic model with economically relevant features such as margin heterogeneity of enterprises , credit constraints , exit of enterprises through bankruptcy , creation of new enterprises , and productivity increase .",
    "these features are in fact complementary and counter - acting mechanisms , implying that a steady state of the system can be found in which the system exhibits statistical regularities .",
    "along with the introduction of these features comes the difficulty  omnipresent in macroeconomic agent - based models  to weight the dominance of the mechanisms via the choice of the parameters .",
    "not only different empirical datasets , but also different viewpoints might lead to different choices .",
    "the model studies the coexistence of two mechanisms : on the one hand , a mechanism introducing a random growth term due to the competition for limited quantities , which on its own yields an explanation for size distribution and growth rate distribution . on the other hand , a mechanism comprising growth via the creation of new more profitable enterprises , as well as interest payments and bankruptcies .",
    "we analyze parameter dependencies of the behaviour both on firm level and on aggregate level .",
    "the results of the model are consistent with a number of empirical studies , but validity of this model could be verified with a multivariate database on firms , and possibly extended .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : model ] , we introduce the model . in section [ sec : results ] we show and discuss numerical results , in section [ sec : validation ] we compare the obtained to existing empirical studies .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusion ] , we conclude and point at possible extensions and applications .",
    "we present here the main elements of the model , whose workings will be introduced successively in the following sections .",
    "we consider three kinds of agents , namely enterprises , workers and a bank .",
    "each enterprise is characterized by its margin @xmath0 .",
    "they all produce the same type of good that is put in the market at the same price , @xmath1 .",
    "this commodity good is an abstraction of purchases in the real sector .",
    "it is a useful concept to ensure that via limited aggregate demand all enterprises are in competition , since the decisions of enterprises are governed by their profits .",
    "enterprises compete only in two quantities , for sales ( i.e. the aggregate demand ) and for workforce .",
    "the number of hired workers , that depends on the enterprise profits and workforce availability , allows us to characterize the enterprise size .",
    "all workers receive the same wage @xmath2 per period when hired , while unemployed workers do not get anything .",
    "enterprises and workers spend their earnings in the goods market . the bank may lend money to the enterprises , mainly to pay wages , and determines the corresponding interest rate . enterprises with large liabilities may go bankrupt , and a constant flow of young enterprises more or less compensates for these disappearances .",
    "more precisely the system is composed of @xmath3 enterprises ( whose number may fluctuate along the iterations , according to the corresponding setting ) , @xmath4 workers and the bank :    enterprises : :    @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) are characterized by    an expected gross margin @xmath7 ( expected sales -    wage expenses)/expected sales , that we call just _ margin _ hereafter .",
    "they produce @xmath8 non - durable goods per period , that are    put on the market at a price @xmath1 .",
    "the margin writes as    follows : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the number of hired    workers . in this paper",
    "we do not allow enterprises modify their    margins : @xmath0 are intrinsic parameters drawn at random    with a uniform probability density in the range    @xmath11 $ ] with    @xmath12 .",
    "notice that these expected gross    margins are distinct from the net margin actually earned by    enterprises , detailed in equation ( [ eq : munet ] ) , which may be negative .",
    "the margin ( [ eq : margin ] ) reflects the productivity and the    technological level of the enterprise : the higher the margin , the    lower the production cost per unit or the lower the number of workers    needed to produce a given quantity . workers : :    @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) may be employed or    unemployed .",
    "when employed they earn a wage @xmath2 per period .    workers do not save , unless they can not satisfy their demand for    goods : like godley and lavoie  @xcite in their ` simplest model ' , and    m. kalecki   @xcite in his profit equation , we assume that workers try    to spend all their earnings in the consumption market .",
    "the bank : :    lends money to enterprises at a constant interest rate    @xmath15 , and keeps track of their equities , which can not be    less than a lower bound @xmath16 that depends on the    enterprises wage bills : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is some positive    constant .",
    "enterprises that do not satisfy this constraint are declared    bankrupt .",
    "the dynamics of the model , visualized in figure [ fig : scheme_complete ] , is detailed below .",
    "we use upper case letters for aggregate quantities , lower case letters for individual quantities , both for firms @xmath5 or workers @xmath13 .",
    "quantities with a hat ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) are initially planned quantities intended by firms before checking constraints .",
    "* at each time step t : *    1 .",
    "* production decision of enterprises : * enterprises calculate their expected production volume @xmath21 according to their previous iteration sales @xmath22 and net profits @xmath23 ( from which interest payments are already subtracted , see equation ( [ eq : pi_net ] ) ) . if profits are positive ( negative ) they plan to produce more ( less ) goods proportionally to their net profit ratio per sold unit : @xmath24 + the number of workers necessary to produce the @xmath25 goods is determined by the intrinsic margin defined in equation ( [ eq : margin ] ) +",
    "@xmath26 2 .",
    "* job market : * the aggregate job offers of enterprises @xmath27 may exceed or fall behind the available number of workers @xmath4 . in our simple job market , workers do not stay at their employer .",
    "they are placed anew at each iteration through a process where job offers and demands are matched at random",
    ". if @xmath28 every worker has the same chance of being hired by some firm , but @xmath29 workers are left unemployed ; if @xmath30 , each job opening has the same probability of being filled , there is full employment and @xmath31 positions remain vacant .",
    "depending on availability each firm @xmath5 will hire a number of workers @xmath32 + it is useful to define an _",
    "effective @xmath33 _ of the system , which is the average @xmath33 at which the workers are hired : @xmath34 its time evolution will allow us to characterize the dynamics of the system .",
    "* credit market : * once the number of hired workers @xmath35 is known , each enterprise calculates whether its owned equities @xmath36 are sufficient to pay the corresponding wages . if necessary",
    ", it takes out a loan of amount @xmath37 from the bank .",
    "the latter determines the interest rate @xmath15 , which in the following is assumed to be time independent and the same for all the enterprises .",
    "the borrowed amount takes into account the interests to be included upon repayment of the debt : @xmath38\\,(1+r ) \\label{eq : loan}\\ ] ] 4 .",
    "* production : * the amount of goods @xmath39 actually produced by the @xmath35 workers hired by firm @xmath5 ( and put in the market ) is given by equation : @xmath40 so firms with a higher @xmath0 produce more goods per worker .",

    "* consumption decision : * workers @xmath13 intend to spend their wages , which allow them to buy a quantity given by : @xmath43 firms @xmath5 intend to spend their expected profits : @xmath44 + the bank does not act as a consumer ( as is done e.g. in @xcite ) , it can merely lose money when enterprises go bankrupt , which compensates for its interest revenues .",
    "thus , the aggregate demand is : @xmath45 6 .",
    "* commodity goods market : * in the case of excess production , the overall offer ( [ eq : goodsoffer ] ) exceeds aggregate demand ( [ eq : demand_all ] ) , i.e. @xmath46 .",

    "this is the situation mainly considered in the present paper .",
    "if @xmath47 , all the production is sold leaving some demands unsatisfied .",

    "( however , in the simulations presented in this paper holds @xmath46 ) .",
    "notice that @xmath41 and @xmath48 need not be known to the enterprises or workers ; they experience if their offer and demand are satisfied by a matching algorithm .",
    "sales of enterprise @xmath5 are @xmath49 + in the second case where enterprises face a random constraint due to limited aggregate demand , unsold goods are lost . in that case the realized gross margin ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : pi_gross ] ) may be lower than the intrinsic margin @xmath0 , and even be negative , as is the case in the examples shown in this paper in figure [ fig : trajectories_mu ] .",
    "( sales in monetary units are @xmath50 . )",
    "7 .   * enterprises balance sheet accounting : * firms must pay interests on the whole amount of their loans , i.e. current lending and accumulated old debts .",
    "if they have enough assets , they repay the loans at the end of the iteration ; if the liabilities exceed the assets , they start the next iteration with a negative net equity . + in order to prepare the production decision of the next period , firms calculate their gross and net realized profit @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( which are identical if @xmath15=0 ) , defined respectively by @xmath53 notice that the normalized gross profit @xmath54 is _ not _ necessarily identical to the margin @xmath0 , which is only reached if all the produced goods are sold .",
    "the gross and net realized margins of an enterprise @xmath55 are @xmath56 and can both take negative values .",
    "* bankruptcy and new enterprises : * enterprises whose equities after repayment of loans ( as far as repayment is possible ) fall below the threshold defined by eq .",
    "( [ bankrthreshold ] ) are declared bankrupt , and are removed from the system .",
    "their ( negative ) equities are losses to the bank . + in order to avoid a decline in the number of enterprises due to bankruptcies , we introduce a small number of new enterprises at each iteration . notice that this differs from the approach by bruun @xcite and delligatti et al .",
    "@xcite , who both replace systematically each bankrupt enterprise by a new one , keeping thus the total number of enterprises constant . in our model",
    "new enterprises are started at a constant rate @xmath57 per iteration , with an initial number of workers ( @xmath58 ) drawn at random between 1 and 3 , and a margin @xmath0 drawn at random within the same range of margins as the initial enterprises . with this procedure",
    "the total number of enterprises fluctuates upon time .",
    "+ in order to endow new enterprises with the possibility to grow faster than existing enterprises and thus slowly displace them , the margin of existing enterprises is recentered at each iteration before new firms are started , such that the new enterprises enter a system with the same @xmath59 throughout the simulation : @xmath60 @xmath59 has a tendency to grow , since according to equation [ eq : n_p_i ] workers tend to move towards enterprises with a higher margin .",
    "the recentering is thus a subtraction and its effect is that the @xmath0 of existing enterprises slowly decline , like an ageing effect ; new enterprises may grow fast because they may have larger margins than the older ones .",
    "this recentering is important for the dynamics of the system : without it , new enterprises would need to start with a higher and higher margin in order to be able to influence the dynamics of the system and displace old enterprises .",
    "then , @xmath59 would continue to rise , which is undesired , since @xmath59 should remain in a ( more or less ) constant relation to the interest rate , such that the interest payments represent the same burden for enterprises throughout the simulation .",
    "heterogeneity of @xmath0 implies that due to equation ( [ eq : n_p_i ] ) enterprises with a higher @xmath0 will offer more posts and therefore grow faster than enterprises with low @xmath0 . on its own , this dynamics",
    "would at first form a power law for enterprise sizes , but on the long term converge to a monopoly of the enterprise with the highest margin .",
    "therefore , @xmath33-heterogeneity needs a counterbalance , constisting in this model of the renormalization of the margin , interest payments , bankruptcies and the creation of new enterprises .",
    "these mechanisms allow to describe statistical regularities rather than monopoly formation .",
    "in this section we discuss results of simulations corresponding to different sets of parameters of the model :    * @xmath61 $ ] , the range of expected margins , * @xmath15 , the interest rate , * @xmath18 , the bankruptcy threshold , * @xmath57 , the number of new enterprises entering per iteration .    in all presented settings enterprises",

    "the wages are fixed @xmath62 in units of the price of the goods , that are the monetary unit in our simulations .",

    "is reached by indebted enterprises , and the higher needs to be the number of new entries per iteration in order to maintain the same level of employment .",
    "the steady state is noisy since the dynamics has two stochastic elements , but for a given set of parameters the system converges to such a state for any initial level of unemployment , any initial size distribution of enterprises , and ( almost ) any number of initially active enterprises .",
    "the system fluctuates in the steady state for the following two reasons : firstly , since enterprises spend a part of their profits for interest payments , they can not spend all their gross profit in the goods market .",
    "thus , their contribution to the aggregate demand falls short of the one required to absorb the offer . as",
    "a result enterprises are not able to sell their entire production .",
    "the profits of enterprises fluctuate due to the random allocations of demand to every offered good , and so does their production decision in the next iteration",
    ". notice that in the case of full employment , the same random allocation holds additionally for the allocation of workers in the job market .",
    "the second reason for fluctuations is due to the random initialization of new enterprises margins @xmath0 : depending on its value they grow , decline and incur debts at different speeds , so the job losses due to bankruptcies fluctuate over time .",
    "the system evolution keeps memory of the past trajectory through the debt distribution among enterprises .",
    "large job losses due to bankruptcies occur in waves , causing lower demand and therefore on average lower net realized profits for firms .",
    "this also impacts the chances and speed of growth of a new enterprise endowed with a higher net margin .",
    "fluctuations are discussed more in detail in section [ sec : fluct ] .",
    "the lifetime of enterprises is limited by the centering of margins ( which always decreases the margins of existing firms ) and by the interest payments , which both may lead to bankruptcies .",

    "all the three margins decrease over time , but the net margin decreases faster , reflecting the interest burden due to interests owed for cumulated loans , which the firm has to pay , up to its eventual bankruptcy .",

    "the stochastic process leading to this is a superposition of two effects : a stochastic process due to competition for demand ( on its own described in @xcite ) , and the dynamics that each enterprise grows ( and later shrinks ) over its lifetime .",

    "this effect also occurs in our model : to reach a large size , enterprises need to attain a certain age . during that time , their margin diminishes due to the recentering of @xmath59 , and the level of debt will increase , so it is not possible for the net margin of big enterprises to range among the higher end of the distribution .",
    "small enterprises , in turn , are more likely to have a net margin above average : of the enterprises with negative net margin , a part goes bankrupt , and evidently can not enter the statistics on average growth rates , so the average growth rate is shifted towards a positive value of growth .",
    "a second tendency produced by the model has empirically been found by @xcite : the width of the tent - shape of the growth rate distribution depends on the enterprise sizes that are considered .",
    "if only the big enterprises are considered , the distribution is much narrower than if it is computed for a sample of small enterprises .",
    "however , a certain range of sizes is necessary . if only enterprises of precisely the same size add to the growth rate distribution",
    ", our model would produce its shape to be gaussian .",
    "the parameters in the model are all relative , i.e. there is no specific meaning what timespan is described by one iteration",
    ". roughly one month could be the order of magnitude .",
    "the type of analysis in this paper is rather suited to understand dependencies , and to tackle the question how much randomness a system has or should have , with respect to the deterministic part of the dynamics .",
    "the relative weight of these two elements is visualized in trajectories of the expected and net @xmath33 shown in figure [ fig : trajectories_mu ] .",
    "in this paper we proposed an agent - based model linking statistical regularities of macroeconomic systems to characteristics of single firms .",
    "this is done by combining a well understood simpler model in a forthcoming paper @xcite with new features , in a way that preserves the mechanisms and thus the arising statistical regularities .",
    "the new elements are heterogeneous margins , interest payments , bankruptcies and recentering of the margin of firms , reflecting an ` ageing process ' .",
    "altogether , the system exhibits a fat tail size distribution ( which can be approximated by a power law ) , a tent - shape growth rate distribution as well as fluctuations in unemployment , in aggregate debt level and in the number of active enterprises .",
    "these fluctuations can be interpreted as business fluctuations .",
    "other possible ways to describe business fluctuations with this model would be to vary some parameters that are currently fixed , such as the effective margin ( reflecting the profit margins ) , the interest rate or the frequency of new entries of enterprises , in order to reproduce a specific situation observed in the real world .",
    "finally we would like to point out some interesting problems for which this model can be useful : ( 1 ) more extended comparisons to data are in progress for growth rates and bankruptcies , but are possible for other quantities such as credit constraints .",
    "( 2 ) in the model presented here , the margin of one enterprise is can not be influenced by its own behaviour throughout an enterprise s lifetime .",
    "productivity increase happens thus only via the creation of new enterprises .",
    "a possible extension of the model would be to let the margin of an enterprise depend on its investments , as is done in @xcite , or by purchasing production goods that depreciate over time as @xcite .",
    "this would allow for enterprises to take strategic choices and to have more variable lifecycles .",
    "( 3 ) the financial sector is very simplified in the model .",
    "decisions of the bank depending on its own balance sheet are not present , as well as variable interest rates or more than one bank , which seems a promising extension in order to study more in detail the role of credit .    5 c. bruun , c. heyn - johnsen _ the paradox of monetary profits : an obstacle to understanding financial and economic crises ? _ , discussion paper no .",
