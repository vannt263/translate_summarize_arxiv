    "given a time interval @xmath6 $ ] and two functional boundaries @xmath15 , @xmath16 , the _ taut string _ is a function @xmath17 that for any ( ! ) convex function @xmath18 provides minimum for the functional @xmath19 among all absolutely continuous functions @xmath20 with given starting and final values and satisfying @xmath21 the list of simultaneously optimized functionals includes energy @xmath4 , variation @xmath22 , graph length @xmath23 , etc .",
    "the first instance of taut strings that we have found in the literature is in g. dantzig s paper @xcite .",
    "dantzig notes there that the problem under study and its solution was discussed in r. bellman s seminar at rand corporation in 1952 .",
    "the taut strings were later used in statistics , see @xcite and @xcite . in the book (",
    "* chapter 4 , subsection 4.4 ) , taut strings are considered in connection with problems in image processing . quite recently",
    ", taut strings were applied to a buffer management problem in communication theory , see @xcite .    in this article , we study the energy of the taut string going through the tube of constant width constructed around sample path of a wiener process @xmath0 , i.e. for some @xmath1 we let @xmath24 , @xmath25 , see fig . [",
    "fig : ts ] .",
    "[ ht ]    we focus attention on the behavior in a long run : we show that when @xmath26 , the taut string spends asymptotically constant amount of energy @xmath27 per unit of time .",
    "precise assertions are given in theorems [ t : mean ] and [ t : alsur ] below .",
    "the constant @xmath12 shows _ how much energy an absolutely continuous function must spend if it is bounded to stay within a certain distance from the non - differentiable trajectory of @xmath0_.    although precise value of @xmath12 remains unknown , we give various theoretical bounds for it in section [ s : estimates ] , as well as the results of computer simulation in section [ s : simulation ] .",
    "the latter suggest @xmath28 .",
    "if we take the pursuit point of view , considering @xmath5 as a trajectory of a particle moving with finite speed and trying to stay close to a brownian particle , then it is much more natural to consider constructions that define @xmath13 in adaptive way , i.e. on the base of the known @xmath14 .",
    "recall that the taut string depends on the entire trajectory @xmath29 , hence it does not fit the adaptive setting . in view of markov property of @xmath0 , the reasonable pursuit strategy for @xmath13 is to move towards @xmath30 with the speed depending on the distance @xmath31 . in this class of algorithms",
    "we find an optimal one in section [ s : pursuit ] .",
    "the corresponding function spends in average @xmath32 units of energy per unit of time .",
    "comparing of two constants shows that we have to pay more than double price for not knowing the future of the trajectory of @xmath0 . to our great surprise",
    ", the search of optimal pursuit strategy boils down to the well known variational problem : minimize fisher information on the class of distributions supported on a fixed bounded interval .",
    "we conjecture that the provided algorithm is the optimal one in the entire class of adaptive algorithms .    in section [ s :",
    "misc ] we establish some connections with other well known settings and problems .",
    "first , we recall that the famous strassen s functional law of the iterated logarithm ( flil ) and its extensions handling convergence rates in flil actually deal exactly with the energy of taut strings .",
    "not surprisingly , we borrowed some techniques for evaluation of this energy from flil research .",
    "yet it should be noticed that flil requires very different range of parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 than those emerging in our case .",
    "the flil tubes are much wider , hence the taut string energy is much lower than ours .",
    "this is why strassen law with its super - slow loglog rates is so hard to reproduce in simulations , while our results handling the same type of quantities are easily observable in computer experiment .",
    "second , we briefly look at the taut string as a minimizer of of variation @xmath35 since @xmath36 is not a _ strictly _ convex function , the corresponding variational problem typically has _ many",
    "_ solutions . in @xcite",
    "another minimizer of @xmath37 is described in detail , a so called _ lazy function_. as e.  schertzer pointed to us , the relations between the taut strings and lazy functions are yet to be clarified .",
    "finally , we briefly describe a discrete analogue of our problem thus giving flavor of eventual applications .    as a conclusion , section [ s : concl ] traces some forthcoming or possible developments of the treated subject .",

    "it is natural to call @xmath41 _",

    "we first notice an almost obvious lipschitz property of the functionals under consideration .    for any @xmath124 , any @xmath125 , g\\in ac[0,t]$ ] we have [ lip0 ] | i_w+g^0(t , r)- i_w^0(t , r ) ||g|_t and [ lip ] | i_w+g(t , r)- i_w(t , r ) ||g|_t    it is remarkable that the lipschitz constant in the right hand side does not depend on @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
