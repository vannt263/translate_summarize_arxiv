    "<S> we find this compound electrically polarized , with a very large electric polarization of @xmath2 100 @xmath3c/@xmath4 , thus even exceeding the polarization of well - known bifeo@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> pbnio@xmath0 is a proper ferroelectric , with polarization driven by large pb - o polar displacements along the [ 111 ] direction . </S>",
    "<S> contrarily to naive expectations , a definite ionic charge of 4 + for pb ion can not be assigned , and in fact the large pb 6@xmath5-o 2@xmath6 hybridization drives the ferroelectric distortion through a lone - pair mechanism similar to that of other pb- and bi - based multiferroics .    _ </S>",
    "<S> introduction _ multiferroics are materials in which different ferroic orders such as ferromagnetism , ferroelectricity and/or ferroelasticity may coexist in one single phase  @xcite . in the last few years , there has been a tremendous boom of interest in these materials , due to the potential applications in memory devices or in novel type of magnetic switching in magnetoelectric multiferroics , based on the cross - coupling between ferroelectric and magnetic channels  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , these materials offer a rich and fascinating playground for the complex physical mechanisms underlying the processes involved in the observed properties.@xcite it is obvious that the search and the prediction by material design of new multiferroics is of great importance for both fundamental physics and technological applications  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> relatively few multiferroics have been identified so far .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite without doubt , the most studied and well characterized multiferroic is bifeo@xmath0  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it crystallizes in the polar space group _ r3c _ ( no . 161 , </S>",
    "<S> point group _ c_@xmath7@xmath8 ) , and is predicted to have a g - type antiferromagnetic ( afm ) alignment of the fe spins  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the _ </S>",
    "<S> r3c _ symmetry corresponds to the so - called linbo@xmath7-type structure , which can be viewed as a highly distorted double perovskite with rhombohedral symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the primitive unit cell contains two formula units ( 10-atoms ) , arising from counterrotations of neighboring o octahedra about the [ 111 ] axis ( see fig.[fig:1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the crystal symmetry allows the presence of a spontanous polarization along the [ 111 ] direction , which arise from the relative displacement of the bi sublattices with respect to the feo@xmath9 octahedra cages along [ 111 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of the large spontaneous polarization of bi@xmath10fe@xmath10o@xmath11@xmath7 , @xmath2 90 @xmath3c/@xmath4  @xcite , has been explained by first principles calculations within the density functional theory plus hubbard - u approach ( dft+u)@xcite and the `` modern theory of polarization '' ( mtp )  @xcite , in terms of the lone - pair electrons present at the bi sites which are ultimately responsible for the large displacement along the [ 111 ] direction  @xcite .    inspired by the recent reports of inaguma _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ on the synthesis of a new antiferromagnetically ordered compound with linbo@xmath7-type structure , such as pbnio@xmath7@xcite , we explore here the possibility of multiferroic behavior in pbnio@xmath7 . </S>",

    "<S> inaguma and coworkers synthesized two high - pressure polymorphs of pbnio@xmath7 with a ( a ) perovskite - type structure and ( b ) the linbo@xmath7-type structure  @xcite ; the latter ( hereafter called l - pbnio@xmath0 ) is thermodynamically more stable than the perovskite - type one at ambient pressure . with respect to the orthorhombic structure , in the acentric rhombohedral linbo@xmath7-type ( _ r3c _ ) structure ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] ) pb and o atoms are displaced against each other along the threefold [ 111 ] axis leading to a large distortion of the pbo@xmath12 and nio@xmath12 octahedra ( see fig.[fig:1 ] ) . </S>",

    "<S> we show that l - pbnio@xmath0 is a _ new _ room - temperature _ multiferroic _ , with an _ exceptionally large _ polarization ( @xmath15 ) of about 100 @xmath3c/@xmath16 , which is the highest polarization ever predicted for any bulk material so far , and @xmath17 10% larger than that of bifeo@xmath0  @xcite .     </S>",
