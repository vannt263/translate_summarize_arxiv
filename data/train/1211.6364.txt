    "the interference of scattering amplitudes in quantum mechanics arises from the indistinguishability of alternative scattering paths , as in the interference of the paths of a photon passing through the celebrated double - slits of young .",
    "for example , a modern variation on the young experiment @xcite shows spatial fringes in the intensity of light scattered from two trapped ions ; but only so long as the scattering can not be traced to one ion or the other @xcite . even in the latter situation , other measurements might be found which can not distinguish between the paths , hence recovering the interference .",
    "typically they involve higher - order moments of the field @xcite , or post - selection , _",
    "i.e. _ , partitioning of scattering events into subensembles @xcite .",
    "such a measurement strategy is termed a `` quantum eraser '' , since it recovers interference by `` erasing '' the information that identifies the path .",
    "a time - domain analogue of double - slit interference can occur inside multi - level atoms , where photon emission via parallel transitions can result in a modulation of the emission intensity at the frequency of a level splitting  the phenomenon of  quantum beats \" ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "a distinction has traditionally been drawn between `` type - i '' or `` v '' atomic systems , where decay of a superposition of upper levels yields beats at the transition difference frequency ; and the inverted `` type - ii '' or `` @xmath0 '' systems , where decay to a superposition of lower levels _ does not _",
    "yield beats @xcite .",
    "the typical argument for the latter outcome is that a measurement of the ground - state population could always , in principle , determine in which of the two available states the electron landed ; as there is no sum over alternative paths to one and the same final state , there are no `` ground - state quantum beats '' @xcite .    nevertheless , as with spatial fringes , a quantum eraser - type strategy can recover time - domain interference in the ground state .",
    "zajonc @xcite proposed one such implementation in a `` type - ii '' atomic system , basing his proposal on two - photon scattering . in this case",
    "the second scattered photon erases the path information written by the first ",
    "amplitudes for the scattering of two photons in sequence interfere .",
    "we recently published experimental results showing quantum beats in spontaneous emission at the frequency of the ground - state zeeman splitting in rb , @xmath1 ground - state quantum beats seen in spontaneous emission @xcite .",
    "oscillations appear in the second - order intensity autocorrelation function only , not in the average intensity , as follows from the indistinguishability requirement above .",
    "the presence of a similar oscillation hidden within the noise of spontaneous emission was demonstrated in 1955 by forrester _",
    "et al . _",
    "they mixed two incoherent light sources  a zeeman doublet  on a photocathode , and used a resonant microwave cavity to enhance the beat signal extracted from the photocurrent noise .",
    "the interference in this case is classical , though the oscillation is recovered from noise through intensity correlation .",
    "more than 50 years later , using coherent excitation and single - photon detectors , we have realized a time - resolved measurement of the ground - state quantum beat recovered from spontaneous emission noise .",
    "the oscillation in our system arises as a complicated mixture of quantum eraser - type interferences within single atoms , pair - wise interference between emission from different atoms , and a homodyne contribution due to the superposition of a weak coherent background ( similar to @xcite ) generated by birefringence in the cavity mirrors . by coupling spontaneous emission into an optical cavity at moderate dipole coupling strength",
    ", we overcome the signal - to - noise limitations set by a small coherence area in free space @xcite , and enforce indistinguishability among different atoms emitting into a common spatial mode .",
    "moreover , we show below that the complicated level structure of @xmath2rb actually aids in the survival of ground - state coherence , counter to the conventional strategy of protecting coherence by limiting the state space through which population can diffuse .",
    "we distinguish here between ground - state coherences imposed by an external drive and those arising spontaneously , selected through the detection process , as in our experiment . in the former case ,",
    "an external magnetic or optical drive couples two ground states directly , with the resulting coherence read out optically in forward scattering ( see @xcite for many examples . ) in the latter , levels couple only through the vacuum , with no external drive to enforce coherence .",
    "the fact that spontaneous decay can generate coherence is evident from the observation of quantum beats at the intermediate level splitting in cascade decay @xcite ; that the same process occurs in transitions to ground or meta - stable states is not therefore surprising .",
    "schubert et al .",
    "@xcite measured such a coherence in the bichromatic cross - correlation of fluorescence from a single ion , where detection of a first photon left the ion in a superposition of meta - stable states . when considering isotropic emission , however , spontaneously created coherences tend to vanish on the average , and for this reason are often left out of density matrix calculations @xcite .",
    "the recent interest follows a 1992 paper @xcite in which specific measurable consequences were claimed ; various arrangements have been explored theoretically @xcite .",
    "a publication as recent as 2005 @xcite claims evidence of the first serious experimental consequences of spontaneously - generated coherence , this in a quantum dot system .",
