    "exploration of the properties of quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions represents a major theme of modern nuclear physics research .",
    "the formation of qgp is heralded by numerous signatures , e.g. , jet - quenching  @xcite , elliptic flow of hadrons  @xcite , quark number scaling of elliptic flow of hadrons@xcite , radiation of thermal photons  @xcite , and suppressed production of @xmath6  @xcite , etc .",
    "the celebrated phenomenon of jet - quenching has its origin in energy loss suffered by high energy quarks and gluons as they traverse the qgp , colliding with other partons and radiating gluons .",
    "it leads to a suppressed production of hadrons having large transverse momenta as compared to the case for nn collisions at the corresponding centre of mass energy per nucleon .",
    "it is measured in terms of the nuclear modification factor @xmath7 , given by : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the impact parameter and @xmath10 is the nuclear overlap function for impact parameter @xmath9 .",
    "the jet - quenching has several other manifestations .",
    "thus , for example , in a non - central collision the jets moving in and out of the reaction plane would cover differing distances inside the plasma , lose differing amounts of energy , and would be quenched to a different extent .",
    "this will lead to an azimuthal anisotropy of momentum distribution of hadrons which does not have its origin in the so - called elliptic flow  @xcite .",
    "next consider a high energy quark which is produced in a hard scattering .",
    "a photon fragmented off this quark contributes to the prompt photon production at high transverse momenta",
    ". the quark may lose energy before its fragmentation and thus this photon production may get suppressed  @xcite .",
    "following the same arguments as above , this may also lead to an azimuthal anisotropy in photon production for non - central collisions  @xcite .",
    "the jet - photon conversion  @xcite and jet - induced bremsstrahlung  @xcite lead to very small contributions with opposite signs for the azimuthal anisotropy of the photon productions  @xcite and are not considered in the present work .    a new dimension to the azimuthal asymmetry and",
    "the jet - quenching has been added by the realization that the event by event fluctuations of the initial conditions may affect the elliptic flow of the final state hadrons  @xcite .",
    "it is not very clear these seriously affect the azimuthal variation of the transverse momenta , which arises from jet - quenching  @xcite as well .",
    "it is expected that the magnitude of all these effects will depend on the dynamics of the collision and the properties of the qgp .",
    "this makes jet - quenching a powerful probe of the qgp .    while there are quite a few detailed studies on the jet - quenching at rhic and lhc energies  @xcite , in the present work we continue the study reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the wang , huang , and sarcevic model  @xcite was used to study the evolution of the mechanism of energy loss at rhic and lhc energies in central collision of heavy nuclei .",
    "the model treats the medium produced in the collision as a plasma of length @xmath11 through which the partons move , undergoing multiple collisions , losing energy through radiated gluons , before fragmenting to form hadrons . the only parameters which then enter the calculations are the path - length- @xmath11 , the mean - free path- @xmath12 , and the energy loss per collision- @xmath1 .",
    "the energy loss per collision is then assumed to take a form as proportional to the energy of the parton- @xmath3 , @xmath4 , or a constant ; depending upon the formation time of the radiated gluons , which is less than the mean free path , larger than the mean free path but less than the path length @xmath11 , and greater than the path length @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "the three regimes are called the bethe - heitler regime , the lpm regime , and the complete coherence regime ( as the entire medium radiates as a whole )  @xcite . the formation time",
    "( or length ) of the radiated gluon is @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the energy of the gluon and @xmath15 is its transverse momentum .    in the present work",
    "we explore the limits of the above approach by performing a detailed and systematic study of medium modification of production of neutral pions and prompt photons having large transverse momenta as a function of centrality and system size , by analyzing the corresponding data at 200 gev / nucleon for collisions of gold nuclei and copper nuclei .",
    "we first seek an accurate description of the medium modification parameter @xmath7 for different centralities and @xmath16 , using the three approaches for the energy loss mechanisms , by varying the coefficients of energy loss , while accounting for the variation of the path length @xmath11 .",
    "we find that the hadrons having low @xmath16 ( @xmath17 5 gev/@xmath18 ) fall into the bethe - heitler regime , those having intermediate @xmath16 ( 5 gev/@xmath18 @xmath17 @xmath16 @xmath17 10 gev/@xmath18 ) fall into the lpm regime , while those having large @xmath16 @xmath19 810 gev/@xmath18 are covered by the complete coherence regime .",
    "we find a systematic decrease of the energy loss per collision as we go to more peripheral collisions from central collisions , as one might expect .",
    "we then use the same parameters to determine the azimuthal anisotropy coefficient @xmath20 for neutral pions having large @xmath16 .",
    "we find that in general , the experimentally obtained @xmath20 is lower than those predicted by our calculations , though the trend is generally reproduced .",
    "part of this discrepancy may have its origin in the uniform densities for the nuclei , used in the present work .",
    "next we calculate the prompt photon production as well as @xmath21 .",
    "again we get reasonable description of the experimental data .",
    "further improvements can perhaps be made by relaxing the condition of equality of mean - free path and energy loss per collision for quarks and gluons assumed while obtaining a description for @xmath22 .",
    "this would , however , increase the number of parameters .",
    "we give our formulation for particle production , multiple scattering , and energy loss as applied to pion production at @xmath23 in sec .",
    "the centrality dependence of nuclear modification of neutral pions and parton energy loss ( de / dx ) for au - au and cu - cu collisions at the highest rhic energy are discussed in sec .",

    "the quantitative description of the data from pp collisions provides us with a reliable base - line to discuss nuclear modification of hadron production in nucleus - nucleus collisions .      in order to calculate the inclusive pion spectra from nucleus - nucleus collisions we have used the effects of shadowing and energy loss of partons .",
    "the nuclear shadowing accounts for the modification of the parton distribution function for nuclei compared to that for a free nucleon .",
    "the shadowing function is defined as : @xmath46 where @xmath24 is the parton distribution for the nucleus a and @xmath47 is that for a nucleon .",

    "the key features of this treatment are : average energy loss per collision ( @xmath48 ) by the parton , the mean free path of the parton ( @xmath49 ) , and the average path length of the parton in the medium ( l ) .",
    "the probability for a parton to scatter @xmath50 times before leaving the medium can be written as : @xmath51 the multiple scattering and energy loss suffered by the partons then necessitates a modification of the fragmentation function @xmath52 . following the model of wang , huang , and",
    "sarcevic  @xcite , the modified fragmentation function can be written as : zd_c / h(z , l , q^2)&=&_n=0^n p_a(n , l ) + & & z_n^a d_c / h^0(z_n^a , q^2 ) + _",

    "+ while one may easily ignore the azimuthal ( @xmath61 ) dependence of the average path length @xmath62 for impact parameter @xmath9 for very central collisions , it needs to be considered for non - central collisions .",
    "we use a simple approach , based on glauber model , to evaluate the dependence of the average path - length on the azimuthal angle with respect to the reaction plane . assuming uniform densities for the colliding nuclei , the average path - length for an impact parameter @xmath9 and azimuthal angle @xmath61 can be written as :    @xmath63    where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the transverse co - ordinates for the point where the partons scatter to produce the jet(s ) which",

    "an average of @xmath70 over @xmath61 ( varying from zero to @xmath71 ) gives the average path length @xmath62 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "we closely follow the excellent review on jet - quenching by baier et al  @xcite , and assume that the collisional energy loss is quite small for light quarks and gluons compared to the energy energy loss due to radiation of gluons .",
    "now one can define the formation time of the radiated gluon as : @xmath72 where @xmath14 is the energy of the radiated gluon and @xmath15 is the transverse momentum .",

    "one can then write , @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the energy parameter introduced to separate the incoherent and coherent radiation of gluons .",
    "in the bethe - heitler ( bh ) regime , the energy of the radiated gluon is less than @xmath80 , the coherence length @xmath81 , leading to an incoherent radiation from @xmath82 scattering centers .",
    "thus energy loss per unit length in the soft @xmath14 limit becomes : @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath3 is the energy of the parton .",
    "we shall write @xmath85 for this case and determine @xmath86 from the measurement of @xmath5 .    for @xmath87 , we have a regime of coherent radiation , where the coherence length @xmath75 is greater than @xmath49 but less than average path length @xmath11 .",

    "@xcite to account for the energy loss of the partons , by modifying the fragmentation function , for the calculations reported here .    a more detailed derivation of the energy loss for this case leads to : @xmath95 where @xmath96 is fourier transform of the normalized differential cross - section for parton - parton collisions for the appropriate momentum transfer scale ( see ref .",
    "the momentum transport coefficient @xmath97 is then defined as : @xmath98 so that we can write : @xmath99 which can be used to deduce the average momentum transport coefficient for any given centrality , for a comparison with other estimates for this .",

    ", it remains to be seen if the @xmath121 could be used to further constrain the energy loss parameters .",
    "the success of the approach , considering that the dynamics of evolution , the temperature and flavour dependence of some of the parameters and a more detailed accounting of various interferences are not considered here , once again confirms the inadequacy of @xmath5 in seriously distinguishing various details of the dynamics of the plasma  @xcite .",

    "note , however , that if we argue that @xmath108 for gluons is twice that for quarks and also that their mean free path is half of that for quarks , then the energy loss for quarks and gluons per collision will be identical .",
    "why does this simple approach work so well ?",
    "we realize that the @xmath16 distribution of jets produced in primary hard scatterings is a rapidly falling function of the transverse momentum .",
    "partons having a transverse momentum @xmath16 after undergoing multiple collisions and losing a momentum @xmath132 will populate the momentum space occupied by partons having transverse momentum @xmath133 while the later will shift to still lower momenta .",
    "thus if we make a good estimate of @xmath132 , we are likely to get a good description of the nuclear modification .    but",
    "is this approach really so simple ?",
    "nlo pqcd and accurate structure and fragmentation functions , along with the applicability of pqcd at larger transverse momenta ensure an accurate base - line for p+p collisions .",
    "the influence of the dynamics of evolution is perhaps softened by the short life - time of the plasma at rhic energies and the fact that most of the energy is lost in collisions at early times .",
    "thus we feel that the present study , at the very minimum , gives a reliable average of the rate of energy loss of partons in quark gluon plasma .",
    "we also see that a simultaneous description of nuclear modification of photon and pion production in nuclear collisions , holds out the hope of getting the energy loss suffered by quarks and gluons independently .",
    "it will definitely be of interest to see if the centrality dependence of @xmath108 ( @xmath134 ) for partons having larger transverse momenta at lhc energies ( 2.76 atev and 5.5 atev ) continues to follow the trend seen for the data at rhic energies for cu+cu and au+au collisions , seen in fig .",
