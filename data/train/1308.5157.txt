    "the inverse compton scattering ( ics ) of relativistic electrons is one of the major radiation mechanisms in high energy astrophysics . since the compton cooling time of electrons decreases linearly with energy , this channel becomes especially prolific in the gamma - ray band .",
    "the universal presence of dense radiation fields makes ics an effective gamma - ray production mechanism in various astronomical environments , in particular in sources containing relativistic outflows - microquasars , agn , grbs , _ etc . _",
    "the dramatically enhanced fluxes , the shift of the spectral energy distribution towards higher energies , and the reduction of characteristic timescales are distinct features of the doppler boosted radiation produced in a relativistically moving source with a doppler factor @xmath0 . in relativistic outflows ,",
    "ics can be realized , depending on the origin of target photon fields , in two different scenarios .    in the so - called synchrotron - self - compton ( ssc ) model the synchrotron photons of relativistic electrons constitute the main target for compton scattering of the same electrons . in its simplified homogeneous one - zone version",
    ", the ssc model assumes that a spherical source ( a `` blob '' ) filled with an isotropic electron population and a random magnetic field , moves towards the observer with a constant doppler factor @xmath1 . the beaming pattern for emission of a relativistically moving source derived by @xcite , can be directly applied to the synchrotron and ssc components of radiation .    in the second scenario , the seed photon field for ics",
    "is dominated by external radiation , i.e. by low - energy photons produced outside the moving source of relativistic electrons . in this , the so - called external compton ( ec ) model the beaming pattern of the inverse compton radiation differs significantly from the beaming pattern of the synchrotron and ssc components @xcite .",
    "the characteristics of ec radiation of a relativistically moving source can be calculated using two different approaches :    \\(i ) transforming first the external radiation photon field to the jet frame , calculating in the same frame the characteristics of the high energy photon ( the outcome of ics ) , and finally transforming the latter back to the observer frame ;    \\(ii ) transforming the electron distribution from the jet frame to the observer frame , and then calculating the spectrum of ic photons directly in the observer frame .",
    "using the first approach , @xcite has derived the ec beaming pattern in the thomson limit assuming a power - law distribution of electrons . @xcite using the second approach have extended this result to the general case of compton scattering , including the klein - nishina regime . in both treatments ,",
    "the distribution of relativistic electrons has been assumed to be isotropic and homogeneous . in the zeroth approximation , this could be a reasonable assumption , and thus can be in principle applied to the interpretation of gamma - ray observations of many blazers .",
    "however , in some other cases one can not exclude significant deviations of distributions of electrons from homogeneous and isotropic realizations .",
    "the non - stationary treatment of the problem is another issue which has not been addressed so far .    in this paper , we develop a new approach which provides a strict formalism for the treatment of the beaming pattern for ec radiation .",
    "namely , we solve the photon transfer equation which allows us to the beaming pattern in a concise way , and , more importantly , to extend the formalism to more general ( non - stationary and anisotropic ) case of electron distributions , but assuming isotropic , homogeneous and isotropic distribution of the seed ( target ) photon fields .",
    "for demonstration of the potential of the proposed formalism , we examine how anisotropy in the electron distribution affects the the energy spectrum and the angular distribution of ec radiation .",
    "in two close points located on the line of sight , the specific intensity ( the spectral radiance ) @xmath2 and emissivity @xmath3 are related as ( see e.g. @xcite ) [ ec1 ] i(s)-i(s - ds)=jds , where @xmath4 is the distance along the line of sight .",
