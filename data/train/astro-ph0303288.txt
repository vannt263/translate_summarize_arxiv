    "we do not discuss here the nature of the source responsible for the initial energy release leading to the grb .",
    "we assume that a relativistic wind has emerged at radius @xmath1 with a variable distribution of the lorentz factor @xmath2 ( with @xmath3 ) .",
    "the energy and mass injection rates are @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the wind production lasts for a total duration @xmath6 ( total ejected mass : @xmath7 ) . at @xmath8 ,",
    "the wind is still optically thick , whereas at the radius @xmath9 where the internal shock phase starts , it has to be already transparent , as indicated by the dominant non - thermal nature of the observed grb spectra .",
    "the radius at which each layer of the relativistic wind becomes transparent can be estimated ( see daigne & mochkovitch 2002 ) : photons emitted by a layer at @xmath10 will successively cross all the layers emitted earlier by the source before they can escape from the relativistic wind at radius @xmath11 : as @xmath12 , we usually have @xmath13 .",
    "the optical depth of a layer at radius @xmath10 is approximatively given by @xmath14 , where the opacity @xmath15 is mainly due to the ambient electrons ( thomson opacity ) .",
    "therefore the photospheric radius ( @xmath16 ) of the layer is given by : @xmath17 .",
    "1 shows this radius for an example where @xmath18 , @xmath19 and the lorentz factor is given in the same figure .",
    "the photospheric luminosity and temperature of each layer can be estimated in the context of the fireball model ( see e.g. piran 1999 ) : @xmath20 where the initial fireball temperature is given by @xmath21 ( @xmath22 is the mass of the central black hole in units of @xmath23 ) . the emitted photons will closely follow a planck distribution , so that the phostopheric emission leads to a spectrum and a count rate in an energy band @xmath24 $ ] : @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the internal shock luminosity is assumed to be @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the efficiency for the conversion of kinetic energy into @xmath31-rays by internal shocks .",
    "this leads to a spectrum and a count rate in energy band @xmath24 $ ] given by @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the observed peak energy of the internal shock spectrum ( @xmath34 ) and @xmath35 is the usual band spectral shape ( with @xmath36 ) , characterized by a low and high - energy slope @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( band et al .",
    "2 shows the spectrum and the time profile obtained in the example of fig .  1 including both the internal shock and the photospheric emission ( with @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) .",
    "the internal shock emission is computed with the model developped by daigne & mochkovitch ( 1998 ) .",
    "the global observed peak energy of the non - thermal photons is 200 kev .",
    "[ fig : resultat1 ]",
    "the ratio of the photospheric over internal shock count rates is given by : @xmath42 this expression indicates that the photospheric thermal emission is usually dominant in the x- and @xmath31-ray bands ( see fig .",
    "2 ) ! this is clearly in disagreement with the observations showing that the grb spectrum is non - thermal in this spectral range . from eq .  4 ,",
    "there are two possible solutions to recover grbs dominated by the non - thermal internal shock component : ( i ) increase of @xmath30 , i.e. more efficient internal shocks .",
    "however , our calculations show that even for @xmath30 close to unity , the thermal component would still be easily detectable ; ( ii ) decrease of @xmath43 and @xmath44 , i.e. a less hot and bright photosphere , compared to the prediction of the standard fireball model . if we define @xmath45 as the fraction of the energy released by the source which is initially under thermal form , the photospheric luminosity and temperature are given by : @xmath46 so that the expression of @xmath47 in eq .",
    "4 has now to be multiplied by a factor @xmath48 . in the standard fireball model",
    "@xmath49 but much smaller values can be expected if a large fraction of the energy realeased by the source is initially under magnetic form .",
    "3 shows exactly the same example as fig .  1 ,",
    "the only difference being that the photospheric emission has been computed with @xmath50 .",
    "a non - thermal burst is recovered in agreement with the observations .",
    "a small thermal precursor is still present in x - rays",
    ". it can be more intense for intermediate values of @xmath45 , so that the photospheric emission predicted in this case could explain the x - ray precursors observed in a few grbs .",
    "we have computed the photospheric thermal emission of a relativistic wind with a highly variable initial distribution of lorentz factor .",
    "we find that : ( 1 ) the photosphere predicted in the standard fireball model for grbs is usually too hot and luminous .",
    "the thermal photospheric emission dominates the non - thermal internal shock emission , even for large internal shock efficiencies .",
    "this is in disagreement with the observations .",
    "( 2 ) a less luminous photosphere is expected if the energy released by the source is initially injected mainly under magnetic rather than thermal form . in this case , we recover grb spectra and temporal profiles dominated by the non - thermal internal shock emission .",
    "( 3 ) we then obtain x - ray precursors which may correspond to the precursor activity observed in a few grbs by ginga and watch / granat . these resultats are presented in more details in daigne & mochkovitch ( 2002 ) ."
