    "synchronization describes the adjustment of rhythms of self - sustained oscillators due to their interaction @xcite .",
    "such collective behavior has important ramifications in myriad natural and laboratory systems  ranging from conservation and pathogen control in ecology @xcite to applications throughout physics , chemistry , and engineering @xcite .",
    "numerous studies have considered the effects of coupling on synchrony using model systems such as kuramoto oscillators @xcite . in a variety of real - world systems , including sets of neurons @xcite and ecological populations @xcite , it is also possible for synchronization to be induced by noise . in many such applications",
    ", one needs to distinguish between extrinsic noise common to all oscillators ( which is the subject of this paper ) and intrinsic noise , which affects each oscillator separately .",
    "consequently , studying oscillator synchrony can also give information about the sources of system noise @xcite .",
    "nakao et al .",
    "@xcite recently developed a theoretical framework for noise - induced synchronization using phase reduction and averaging methods on an ensemble of uncoupled identical oscillators .",
    "they demonstrated that noise alone is sufficient to synchronize a population of identical limit - cycle oscillators subject to independent noises , and similar ideas have now been applied to a variety of applications @xcite .",
    "papers such as @xcite characterized a system s synchrony predominantly by considering the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of phase differences between pairs of oscillators .",
    "this can give a good qualitative representation of ensemble dynamics , but it is unclear how to subsequently obtain quantitative measurements of aggregate synchrony @xcite .",
    "it is therefore desirable to devise new order parameters whose properties can be studied analytically ( at least for model systems ) .",
    "investigations of the combined effects of common noise and coupling have typically taken the form of studying a pdf for a pair of coupled oscillators in a specific application @xcite .",
    "recently , however , nagai and kori @xcite considered the effect of a common noise source in a large ensemble of globally coupled , nonidentical oscillators .",
    "they derived some analytical results as the number of oscillators @xmath0 by considering a nonlinear partial differential equation ( pde ) describing the density of the oscillators and applying the ott - antonsen ( oa ) ansatz @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we consider the interaction between noise and coupling .",
    "we first suppose that each oscillator s natural frequency ( @xmath1 ) is drawn from a unimodal distribution function . for concreteness , we choose a generalized cauchy distribution @xmath2 whose width is characterized by the parameter @xmath3 .",
    "the case @xmath4 yields the cauchy - lorentz distribution , and @xmath5 is the mean frequency .",
    "we investigate the effects on synchrony of varying the distribution width .",
    "taking the limit @xmath6 yields the case of identical oscillators ; by setting the coupling strength to @xmath7 , our setup makes it possible to answer the hitherto unsolved question of whether common noise alone is sufficient to synchronize nonidentical oscillators .",
    "we then consider noise introduced through a general phase - sensitivity function , . ] which we express in terms of fourier series .",
    "when only the first fourier mode is present , we obtain good agreement between theory and simulations .",
    "however , our method breaks down when higher fourier modes dominate , as clustering effects @xcite imply that common noise can cause a decrease in our measure of synchrony .",
    "nevertheless , we show that such noise can reinforce clustering caused by different forms of coupling .",
    "finally , we consider noise - induced synchrony in antiferromagnetically coupled systems , in which pairs of oscillators are negatively coupled to each other when they belong to different families but positively coupled to each other when they belong to the same family .",
    "we start by considering globally coupled phase oscillators subject to a common external force : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are ( respectively ) the phase and natural frequency of the @xmath11th oscillator , @xmath12 is the coupling strength , @xmath13 is a common external force , the parameter @xmath14 indicates the strength of the noise , and the _ phase - sensitivity function _",

    "we have examined noise - induced synchronization , desynchronization , and clustering in globally coupled , nonidentical oscillators .",
    "we demonstrated that noise alone is sufficient to synchronize nonidentical oscillators .",
    "however , the extent to which common noise induces synchronization depends on the magnitude of the coefficient of the first fourier mode . in particular , the domination of higher fourier modes can disrupt synchrony by causing clustering .",
    "we then considered higher - order coupling and showed that the cluster synchrony generated by such coupling is reinforced by noise if the phase - sensitivity function consists of fourier modes of the same order as the coupling .",
    "one obvious avenue for future work is the development of a theoretical framework that would make it possible to consider multiple harmonics of both the coupling function and the phase - sensitivity function .",
    "it would also be interesting to consider generalizations of antiferromagnetic coupling , such as the variant studied in ref .",

    "the present work is relevant for applications in many disciplines .",
    "for example , examining the synchronization of oscillators of different frequencies might be helpful for examining spike - time reliability in neurons @xcite .",
    "one could examine the interplay of antiferromagnetic coupling and noise - induced synchrony using electronic circuits such as those studied experimentally in @xcite , and our original motivation for studying antiferromagnetic synchrony arose from experiments on nanomechanical oscillators @xcite .",
