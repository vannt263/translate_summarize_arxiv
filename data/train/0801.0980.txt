    "one convenient way to model uncertain dynamical systems is to describe them as markov chains .",
    "these have been studied in great detail , and their properties are well known . however , in many practical situations , it remains a challenge to accurately identify the transition probabilities in the markov chain : the available information about physical systems is often imprecise and uncertain . describing a real - life dynamical system as a markov chain will therefore often involve unwarranted precision , and may lead to conclusions not supported by the available information .",
    "for this reason , it seems quite useful to perform probabilistic robustness studies , or sensitivity analyses , for markov chains .",
    "this is especially relevant in decision - making applications .",
    "many researchers in markov chain decision making @xcite  inspired by @xcite s  @xcite original work  have paid attention to this issue of ` imprecision ' in markov chains .",
    "work on the more mathematical aspects of modelling such imprecision in markov chains was initiated in the early 1980s by @xcite ( see @xcite ) , under the name ` markov set - chains ' .",
    "s work seems to have been unknown to @xcite , who approached the subject from a different angle .",
    "armed with linear programming techniques , these authors performed an experimental study of the limit behaviour of markov chains with uncertain transition probabilities .",
    "more recently , @xcite has also contributed to a formal study of the time evolution and limit behaviour of such systems .",
    "markov set - chains can also be seen as special cases of so - called _ credal networks _ under strong independence @xcite .",
    "all these approaches use to deal with the imprecision in the transition probabilities .",
    "when these probabilities are not well known , they are assumed to belong to certain sets , and robustness analyses are performed by allowing the transition probabilities to vary over such sets .",
    "this should be contrasted with more common ways of performing a sensitivity analysis : looking at small deviations from a reference model and evaluating derivatives of important variables in this reference point .",
    "as we shall see , the sets of probabilities approach leads to a number of computational difficulties .",
    "but we will show that they can be overcome by tackling the problem from another angle , using lower and upper expectations , rather than sets of probabilities .",
    "our new method also makes it fairly easy to formulate and prove convergence ( or perron  frobenius - like ) results for markov chains with uncertain transition probabilities that hold under weaker conditions than the ones found by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we shall see that our condition for this convergence , which requires that the imprecise markov chain should be _ regularly absorbing _ , is implied by , and even strictly weaker than , both @xcite s _ product scrambling _ and @xcite s _ regularity _ conditions .",
    "in the rest of this introduction , we give an overview of the theory of classical markov chains and formulate the classical perron ",
    "frobenius theorem .",
    "then , in sections  [ sec : towards ] and  [ sec : sensitivity - analysis ] , we introduce imprecise markov chains and generalise many aspects of the classical theory . in section  [ sec :",
    "accessibility ] , we briefly discuss accessibility relations , which allows us to give a nice interpretation to a number of conditions that will turn out to be sufficient for a perron  frobenius - like convergence result . in section  [ sec",
    ": convergence ] , we generalise the classical perron  frobenius theorem , and explore the relation of our generalisation with previous work in the literature .",
    "we discuss a number of theoretical and numerical examples in section  [ sec : examples ] , and we give perspectives for further research in the conclusions .",

    "moreover , as the following counterexample shows , it is easy to find examples of stationary imprecise markov chains that are regularly absorbing but for which the corresponding set @xmath323 is not product scrambling .",
    "another , perhaps more involved , such counterexample will be presented near the end of section  [ sec : k - out - of - n ] .",

    "this question would involve assessing the failure probabilities of the @xmath459 possible configurations of component states .",

    "are precisely those systems that fail as soon as any @xmath108 out of the @xmath0 components fail , also known as @xmath108-out - of-@xmath0:f systems .    for such systems ,",

    "we can then use a practical version of eq .   to find the corresponding upper expectations ,",
    "namely ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* section  3.1.3 ) : @xmath499    we can now consider imprecise markov chains where the local models , attached to the non - terminal situations in the tree , are of this type .",
    "the general backwards recursion formulae we have given in section  [ sec : sensitivity - analysis ] can then be used in combination with the formulae of the type   and   for the calculation of all conditional and joint upper and lower expectations in the tree .",
    "to conclude , we ( i )  reflect on what type of convergence results could be obtained for imprecise markov chains that are not regularly absorbing , ( ii )  we pay attention to the important issue of interpretation of imprecise - probability models , and ( iii )  we compare @xcite s approach  @xcite to our own regarding their practical applicability to deal with expectation problems .",
    "it is a reasonably weak requirement for a stationary imprecise markov chain with upper transition operator  @xmath304 to be regularly absorbing , but we have seen that it is strong enough to guarantee that the upper expectation for the state at time  @xmath0 converges to a uniquely @xmath304-invariant upper expectation @xmath302 , regardless of the initial upper expectation @xmath170 .    even when an imprecise markov chain is not regularly absorbing , it is not so hard to see that its upper transition operator  @xmath304 is still _ non - expansive _ under the supremum norm given for every @xmath500 by @xmath501 , as @xmath502 moreover , the sequence @xmath503 is bounded because @xmath504 .",
    "it then follows from non - linear perron ",
    "frobenius theory @xcite that the sequence @xmath505 has a periodic limit cycle .",
    "more precisely , there is a @xmath506 such that @xmath507 i.e. , @xmath508 is a of  @xmath304 with ( smallest )  @xmath509 , and such that @xmath510 ( point - wise ) as @xmath1 .",
    "it would be a very interesting topic for further research to study the nature of the periods and periodic points of upper transition operators .    in our discussions ,",
    "for instance in section  [ sec : sensitivity - analysis ] , we have consistently used the sensitivity analysis interpretation of imprecise - probability models such as upper expectations .",
    "upper and lower expectations can also be given another , so - called _ behavioural _ interpretation , in terms of some subject s dispositions towards accepting risky transactions .",
    "this is for instance @xcite s @xcite preferred approach .",
    "the results we have derived here remain valid on that alternative interpretation , and the concatenation formulae   and   can then be shown to be special cases of so - called _ marginal extension _",
    "procedure @xcite , which provides the most conservative coherent ( i.e. , rational ) inferences from the local predictive models @xmath226 to general lower and upper expectations . in another paper  , we give more details about how to approach a process theory using imprecise probabilities on a behavioural interpretation .    on a related matter : the imprecise markov chains we are considering here can be seen as special _ credal networks _",
    "@xcite : the generalisation of bayesian networks to the case where the local models , associated with the nodes of the network , are credal sets . the corresponding ` independence '",

    "interestingly , @xcite s markov set - chain approach corresponds to special credal nets where the independence concept involved is a different one : that of _ strong independence _",
    "nevertheless , both approaches yield the same results if we restrict ourselves to calculating the marginal upper expectations for variables @xmath4 , as we have proved in proposition  [ prop : hartfiel - and - us ] .",
    "but in any case , for the actual calculation of expectations , the set of transition matrices approach suffers from a combinatorial explosion of computational complexity that can be avoided using our upper transition operator approach .",
