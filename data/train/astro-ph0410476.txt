    "sn1999cw was discovered on june @xmath2,1999 by johnson & li with kait telescope , @xmath3 east and @xmath4 south of the nucleus of mcg-01 - 02 - 001 ( ra= 0h 20 m 1s.46 and dec= -6@xmath5 20 03.6 , j2000 ) , a barred spiral galaxy ( sbab ) , with redshift z= 0.0125 and galactic extinction @xmath6 = 0.154 mag ( schlegel et al , 1998 ) .",
    "the preliminary reduction of a dfosc spectrum showed that it was a peculiar type ia supernova ( rizzi et al,1999 ) .",
    "immediately after the discovery , we began to observe sn1999cw collecting data both in optical and infrared wavelengths .",
    "photometric data have been reduced by using psf technique by mean of the snoopy procedures ( patat , 1995 ) , which are based on iraf tasks .",
    "the results have been checked and compared with different photometric reduction methods , namely daophot and template subtraction producing comparable results(bufano , 2004 ) .",
    "the resulting ubvri light curves are reported in fig [ figura ] .",
    "sn1999cw is well sampled , but it is clear that observations began after the epoch of maximum light , even if they cover a very long period of the supernova evolution .",
    "light curves are characterized by a relatively slow luminosity decline rate and a secondary maximum light in r and i bands . in order to define the epoch of maximum ,",
    "we have applied the method by altavilla et al ( 2004 ) , which minimize the @xmath7 value with respect to a number of templates .",
    "the best fit is obtained with slow declining sne ia , similar to sn1991 t . in particular , sn1991 t and sn1999cw have same shape and post - maximum decline rate @xmath8 . by overplotting the light curves , we find that the b light curve maximum occured on @xmath9 @xmath10 at @xmath11 thus our observations began five days after maximum light . by fitting v and r light curves , we obtain @xmath12 and @xmath13 + to derive the reddening of sn1999cw we used @xmath14 color curve and the empirical relation of phillips ( 1999 ) .",
    "we found that sn1999cw did not suffer of any significant dust absorption inside to the host galaxy .",
    "so the absolute b magnitude is @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "this value is in good agreement with the value , @xmath18 mag , computed by using altavilla s empirical relation @xmath19 vs @xmath20 , based on nearby sne for which distance can be determinate by cepheids .",
    "+        the spectral evolution of sn1999cw is plotted in fig 1 .",
    "because of the lack of information around the maximum , we can not study the appearance of siii lines ( or other intermediate - mass element lines ) typical of the sne 1991t - like around this phase .",
    "the siii @xmath21 absorption line is already present in the first spectrum , but it is particularly weak . by using our new procedure `` passpartoo '' ( harutyunyan , this conference ) , we compared sn1999cw spectra with all the data in the padova - asiago supernovae archive and verified that the best fit is with over - luminous type ia sne . by measuring the minimum of the siii absorption line in the first spectrum , we deduce an expansion velocity v@xmath2210.700 km / s . in the following spectra ,",
    "the velocity remained nearly costant , in analogy to the velocity evolution of sn1991 t and similar objects ( benetti , this conference ) ."
