    "the work on three - dimensional ( 3d ) gravity theories has seen a great impulse after the discovery that 3d general relativity possesses a black hole solution , the bahados - teitelboim - zanelli ( btz ) black hole @xcite . before the appearance of this black hole solution",
    "there were , however , important works in 3d general relativity which studied the properties of point particles in 3d geometries @xcite as well as solutions with matter @xcite , and showed that it provides a testbed for 4d and higher - d theories @xcite .",
    "in addition there were works in 3d string theory with its associated black strings @xcite .",
    "however , because of the lack of black holes there was no possibility of discussing important issues such as the entropy of the gravitational field , its degrees of freedom , and hawking evaporation .",
    "the work by baados , teitelboim , zanelli , and henneaux @xcite brought then 3d general relativity into the level of complexity of 4d general relativity . this black hole is a solution of the einstein - hilbert action including a negative cosmological constant term @xmath0 .",
    "one can also show that the btz black hole can be constructed by identifying certain points of the 3d anti  de sitter ( ads ) spacetime @xcite . since the ads spacetime is a simple manifold one can study many properties of the btz black hole through known results in ads spaces , upon making further appropriate global identifications ( see @xcite for a review ) .    after the btz solution a whole set of new solutions in 3d followed from a number of different dilaton - gauge vector theories coupled to gravity .",
    "for instance , upon reducing 4d einstein - maxwell theory with @xmath0 and with one spatial killing vector it was shown in @xcite that it gives rise to a 3d brans - dicke - maxwell theory with its own black hole , which when reinterpreted back in 4d is a black hole with a toroidal horizon .",
    "one can then naturally extend the whole set to brans - dicke theories @xcite .",
    "other solutions with different couplings have also been found @xcite ( see @xcite for a more complete list ) .",
    "one important ingredient in these solutions is the presence of a negative cosmological constant , @xmath1 .",
    "the interest in these solutions appeared after it was shown that gauged supergravity requires for its ground state a @xmath1 term , such that spacetime is ads or asymptotically ads .",
    "many of these black holes , such as the btz black hole , only exist in theories with a negative @xmath0 @xcite , which in turn motivated their further study .",
    "a renewal of interest in these solutions came after the ads - conformal field theory ( ads - cft ) conjecture @xcite .",
    "this conjecture states the equivalence between string theory on an ads background and a corresponding cft defined on the boundary of ads spacetime , i.e. , between ads@xmath2 and a cft@xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath4 case ( i.e. , 3d ) , mainly through the btz black hole , plays an important role in the verification of the conjecture , since many higher - d extreme black holes of string theory have a near - horizon geometry containing the btz black hole . then the conjecture says that if one has , e.g. , a 10-dimensional type iib supergravity , compactified into a @xmath5 spacetime , the btz in the bulk corresponds to a thermal state in the boundary cft @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to embed the 4d toroidal black holes @xcite in a higher - d string theory such that they can be interpreted as the near horizon structures of an @xmath6 brane rotating in extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "now , in order to find solutions in a given dimension , @xmath7 say , one usually starts from the action of gravity theory with the generic dilaton and gauge vector couplings in that dimension , derives the corresponding equations of motion , tries an ansatz for the solution and then finally from the differential equations finds the black hole solutions compatible with the ansatz .",
    "this is the case for the schwarzschild solution for instance , and for many of the 3d solutions quoted above .",
    "another way of finding solutions arises if the theory possesses dualities , i.e. , symmetries that convert one solution into another in a nontrivial way @xcite .",
    "yet another way , which can be seen as a special case of duality , is through dimensional reduction , where one can reduce a theory by several dimensions .",
    "the simplest case is to reduce by one dimension , i.e. , one starts with a ( @xmath8)d lagrangian theory and through a suitable procedure reduces it along a symmetry direction into a new @xmath7d lagrangian theory .",
    "there are a number of inequivalent procedures to perform a dimensional reduction , two of those are the dimensional reduction through a kaluza - klein ansatz ( or classical kaluza - klein reduction ) @xcite , and the lagrangian dimensional reduction @xcite .",
    "when one is reducing through one symmetric compact direction ( a circle ) , which will be the cases studied here , both procedures are equivalent @xcite . in the reduction process scalars and gauge vector fields appear naturally .",
    "the symmetry direction of the solution in the ( @xmath8)d theory defines a killing vector and a killing direction , which in general can be compact or non - compact . in turn , in the non - compact case the reduction process can be important to the original theory in ( @xmath8)d . for example , for a black hole solution in the lower @xmath7d theory one can give precise definitions of charges ( mass , angular momentum , electromagnetic , dilaton and axion charges ) , which in the ( @xmath8)d theory are then converted into charges per unit length of the corresponding black string @xcite .",
    "in the past two decades , due to the extra dimensions required by supergravity and string theories , the techniques of compactification and dimensional reduction have became powerful tools to build and analyze black hole solutions in lower dimensions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we follow the classical kaluza - klein procedure , here equivalent to the lagrangian dimensional reduction procedure , to find new solutions in 3d from solutions in 4d .",
    "an extensive study of 4d solutions of gravity coupled to sigma model theories and their corresponding kaluza - klein 3d counterparts has been performed @xcite , in which , in the last section of the paper on `` open problems '' the authors state that the inclusion of a cosmological constant is important .",
    "it is our aim to apply the dimensional reduction technique to construct 3d black holes from the 4d toroidal ads black holes @xcite . sect .",
    "ii is dedicated to a review of the dimensional reduction method particularized to the case of reduction from 4d to 3d .",
    "the definition of the charges for all fields , new and old , appearing in 3d is also given .",
    "then , in sect .",
    "iii , dimensional reduction , through the killing azimuthal direction @xmath9 , of rotating charged black holes with toroidal topology is considered .",
    "the produced 3d black holes display an isotropic horizon ( i.e. , circularly symmetric ) , and the new charges are neatly found . in sect .",
    "iv we conclude .",
    "in this subsection we discuss the connection between the einstein - maxwell - ads equations in a four - dimensional ( 4d ) spacetime with a killing vector and the equations in the corresponding 3d spacetime .",
    "we assume that the 4d manifold @xmath10 can be decomposed as @xmath11 or @xmath12 , with @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 being the 3d manifold , the circle , and the real line , respectively .",
    "the action @xmath16 in 4d spacetimes is assumed to be the usual einstein - hilbert - maxwell action with cosmological term @xmath17 and electromagnetic field @xmath18 ( where @xmath19 is the gauge field ) , given by ( we use geometric units where @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the lagrangian density , or lagrangian .",
    "the convention adopted here is that quantities wearing hats are defined in 4d and quantities without hats belong to 3d manifolds .",
    "we now proceed with the reduction of the action ( [ lagrn1 ] ) to 3d . in order to do that consider then a 4d spacetime metric admitting one spacelike killing vector , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 can be a compact or a non - compact direction .",
    "in such a case the 4d metric may be decomposed into the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the 3d metric , @xmath28 , @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) and all the other metric coefficients are functions independent of @xmath25 , and @xmath31 , @xmath32 are numbers . to dimensionally reduce the electromagnetic gauge field we do @xmath33 where for compact @xmath25 the gauge group is @xmath34 and for non - compact @xmath25 it is @xmath15 . in the last equation @xmath35",

    "we will work mainly with the good frame , and we will comment later on the other frames .",
    "as it will be seen later on , the 3d solutions are obtained from the 4d metric and the other 4d fields by direct inspection of the metric and correct truncation of extra fields .",
