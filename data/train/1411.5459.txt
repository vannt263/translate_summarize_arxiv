    "@xmath0-skeletons @xcite belong to the family of proximity graphs , geometric graphs in which two vertices ( points ) produce an edge if and only if they satisfy particular geometric requirements .",
    "the proximity graphs are both important and popular because of many practical applications .",
    "they span a broad spectrum of areas , from earlier work on mathematical morphology on lattices and graphs , pattern recognition , geographic information systems , data mining to more recent applications in ad hoc wireless networks and systems biology .",
    "requirements defining proximity graphs can be formulated in many metrics , with the euclidean metric being one of the most commonly used .    for",
    "a given set @xmath4 containing @xmath1 points in @xmath5 , distance function @xmath6 and the parameter @xmath0 we define @xmath0-skeleton as a graph @xmath7 , in which @xmath8 iff no point in @xmath9 belongs to @xmath10 , where    * for @xmath11 , @xmath10 is the segment @xmath12 ; * for @xmath13 , @xmath10 is the intersection of two discs with the radius @xmath14 , which boundaries contain the both points @xmath15 and @xmath16 .    for @xmath17",
    "there are two ways to define the region @xmath10 leading to two different families of graphs .",
    "+ the lune - based definition is as follows :    * for @xmath17 , @xmath10 is a intersection of two discs with radius @xmath18 and centered in points @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively . * for @xmath21",
    ", @xmath10 is an unbounded strip between two lines containing @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively , and perpendicular to the segment @xmath12 .",
    "the second definition defining a different family of graphs is circle - based .    * for @xmath22",
    ", @xmath10 is the union of two discs , each having diameter @xmath23 and having the segment @xmath12 as its chord . * for @xmath21",
    ", @xmath10 is the union of hyperplanes having the segment @xmath12 on their border .     for @xmath24 ( left ) , the lune - based region @xmath25 for @xmath22 ( middle ) and the circle - based region @xmath25 for @xmath22 ( right ) . ]",
    "the open ( closed , respectively ) area @xmath10 defines an open ( closed , respectively ) @xmath0-skeleton . a gabriel graph ( gg ) @xcite is a closed @xmath26-skeleton and a relative neighborhood graph ( rng ) @xcite is an open @xmath27-skeleton . + for @xmath28 , there are in the worst case optimal @xmath29 time algorithms @xcite for both lune - based and circle - based @xmath0-skeletons .",
    "also , any @xmath0-skeleton for @xmath30 can be computed in the optimal @xmath31 time ( @xcite ) . for circle - based @xmath0-skeletons , where @xmath17 , there also is an optimal @xmath31 time algorithm @xcite .    for @xmath32 , the lune - based and circle - based regions @xmath33 are very different and it has been reflected by higher running times of the best known algorithms for the lune - based @xmath0-skeletons . in particular , for @xmath34 ,",
    "the fastest algorithm that has been reported for computing lune - based @xmath0-skeletons requires @xmath35 time @xcite .",
    "the algorithm uses the sweeping - line technique .",
    "+ in this paper , we will show a @xmath3 time algorithm computing a lune - based @xmath0-skeleton for @xmath34 . to this end",
    ", we will use arrangements of curve segments @xcite and data structure for point location in monotone subdivisions @xcite .",
    "it is well known , see e.g. @xcite , that @xmath0-skeletons for @xmath36 are subgraphs of the delaunay triangulation of the input point sets . for a set @xmath4 of @xmath1 points , they have size @xmath37 .",
    "thus , to construct a @xmath0-skeleton , we can use their definition to eliminate edges that do not belong to @xmath0-skeleton by comparing edges of delaunay triangulation against all of the points in the input set . to this end",
    ", we analyze lunes ( for @xmath38 ) or strips ( for @xmath21 ) defined by the edges of the dt triangulation . + specifically , we have to identify these lunes or strips that contain points in @xmath4 .",
    "+ let us consider @xmath39 edges of the delaunay triangulation of @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath39 will be determined later to minimize the running time .",
    "+        we construct arrangement of lunes defined by these edges .",
    "specifically , for each of the lunes , we draw two horizontal half - lines that start at the points with the smallest and , respectively , largest @xmath15-coordinates .",
    "they yield three monotone regions per lune ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "the size of the arrangement is @xmath40 and the time complexity of its construction is the same @xcite .",
    "+ the intersection of monotone regions is monotone .",
    "the above construction results in a monotone subdivision of size @xmath40 for the arrangement of size @xmath40 .",
    "+ then , we locate points of @xmath4 in regions of the subdivision .",
    "the construction time of an auxiliary data structure is linear with respect to a size of the subdivision @xcite .",
    "hence it can be done in @xmath40 time and @xmath40 space .",
    "a query time is @xmath41 .",
    "the results of querying are stored in respective cells of the subdivision data structure .",
    "+ we traverse the dual graph of the subdivision in a depth - first - search fashion in order to identify ( and store ) edges of the delaunay triangulations that do not belong the @xmath0-skeleton and lunes ( strips , respectively ) containing currently visited region of the subdivision .",
    "+        the structure is a table of lunes ( strips , respectively ) forming the subdivision with    * records storing - value _ true _ when the respective lune contains some point of @xmath4 and _ false _ otherwise and * pointers to a double linked list of lunes ( strips , respectively ) containing currently visited region which respective records are _",
    "false_.    moving between two neighboring regions we visit or leave the lune or our status stays unchanged . + in the first case :    * if record of the auxiliary structure of this lune has value _ false _ we add the lune to the list in the structure ; otherwise the list stays unchanged , * if visited region contains a point of @xmath4 we change values of records of all lunes belonging to the list on _ true _ and erase the list .    in the second case",
    "we remove the lune form the list if its record has value _",
    "false_. + in the third case all data structures stay unchanged .",
    "+ visiting all regions of the subdivision take @xmath40 time .",
    "+ we repeat the above process for all the groups in the partition of the edges into groups of size @xmath39 .    for @xmath34 , @xmath0-skeleton of a set @xmath4 of @xmath1 points in the plane",
    "can be constructed in @xmath3 time and @xmath31 space .",
    "the time complexity of every steps of the algorithm is @xmath42 .",
    "the value of this function is minimal for @xmath43 .",
    "hence the time complexity of the algorithm is @xmath3 .",
    "space complexity of the algorithm is @xmath44 .",
    "we have presented a new algorithm for the lune based @xmath0-skeletons , where @xmath32 . for circle - based skeletons",
    "the approach would work as well , however better algorithms are known in that case .",
    "although the algorithm provides only an incremental improvement compared to the previous one , the improvement is interesting due to a tantalizing jump in the algorithmic complexity of the @xmath0-skeleton problem that occurs for @xmath45 .",
    "while for @xmath46 optimal algorithms are known , the optimality is open for @xmath32 .",
    "the presented algorithm narrows the gap , however more research is needed to better understand the reasons for this apparent difficulty for @xmath32 ."
