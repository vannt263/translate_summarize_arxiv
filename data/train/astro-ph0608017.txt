    "the temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation have proved to be the single most important cosmological observable we have today , and the high - precision full - sky maps provided by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) play a very important role in the determination of cosmological parameters and preferred cosmological models @xcite .",
    "one of the most important conclusions both from the wmap data alone , and from joint analyses including other cosmological observables , is that a simple six - parameter flat @xmath9cdm model fits the data very well , and that extended models with additional free parameters do not improve the fit significantly .    because of the great impact of wmap data , the 3-year data analysis from the wmap team has been subject to exhaustive cross - checking . in particular , in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite two noticeable issues with the likelihood code as first presented by the wmap team were pointed out .",
    "first , the likelihood approximation used between @xmath10 appears to be inadequate , effectively resulting in a @xmath11 power excess in this range compared to an exact treatment .",
    "second , the amplitude for the unresolved point source spectrum used by the wmap team was found to over - subtract the actual contribution in the data , leading to a power deficit at high @xmath12 s .    in @xcite , the effect of these discrepancies",
    "were studied for a minimal six - parameter cosmological model .",
    "this was done both for wmap data only , and with additional cmb data from small - scale experiments .",
    "their main finding was an increase in @xmath2 , lowering the significance of @xmath13 from @xmath14 to @xmath15 .",
    "in this paper we consider the effect on extended cosmological models .",
    "we study how the modified wmap likelihood affects the preferred ranges of the running of the scalar spectral index , the cosmological neutrino mass limits , spatial curvature , and the equation of state for dark energy .",
    "we have also taken into account large - scale structure ( lss ) and type 1a supernovae ( snia ) data sets , to see whether the shifts in preferred parameter ranges survive a more thorough cosmological analysis .",
    "further , we consider whether the shift of @xmath2 to larger values is robust to changes in cosmological models and data sets .    in the next section ,",
    "we review both the methods and data we use . in section [ sec : results ] , we report and comment upon our results , before summarizing and concluding in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the wmap experiment is a nasa - funded satellite mission designed to measure the cmb temperature anisotropies over the full sky at five frequencies between 23 and 94 ghz with unprecedented angular resolution and sensitivity .",
    "these measurements allow for an accurate determination of the angular cmb power spectrum for angular scales between , say , @xmath16 and 800 with three years of observations .",
    "estimation of this spectrum and the corresponding likelihood function is a multi - step process .",
    "first , sky maps are generated from the raw satellite data , and the instrumental noise is estimated .",
    "second , contaminants in the form of galactic and extra - galactic foregrounds are removed from the sky maps , and severely contaminated regions are removed completely from further analysis .",
    "third , the power spectrum is estimated with some algorithm , usually trading off computational efficiency against accuracy .",
    "fourth , a connection is made between the power spectrum and the likelihood .",
    "these steps are all described in detail for the three - year wmap data release in ref .",
    "the main result of these efforts is a user - friendly fortran 90 code that for an input power spectrum outputs the corresponding likelihood value . in principle",
    ", this piece of code may be used as a `` black box '' .",
    "however , some care is warranted .",
    "in particular , two points were noted in ref .",
    "first , there is a @xmath11 descrepancy between the temperature likelihood approximation used by the wmap team and an exact evaluation for @xmath0 .",
    "second , there is a @xmath17 discrepancy between the two spectra observed at 61 and 94 ghz .",
    "the former is primarily due to estimator approximations and secondarily to residual foregrounds .",
    "the latter issue was later partly explained in terms of an excessive point source correction applied to the wmap spectrum @xcite .",
    "in the present paper , we therefore use two versions of the wmap likelihood .",
    "the first version is simply the official code as provided on lambda .",
    "the second version includes two modifications to this code : at @xmath18 , we replace both the wmap pixel - based likelihood and the pseudo-@xmath19-based likelihood with an exact gibbs sampling based estimator @xcite .",
    "then the spectrum amplitude of unresolved point sources ( relative to 41 ghz ) is adjusted from @xmath20 to @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "we do not marginalize over the sz ( sunyaev - zeldovich ) amplitude in our analyses .",
    "in our analysis we use additional cmb data , data from lss surveys , snia data and additional priors on the hubble parameter and baryon content of the universe .      to probe a larger range of angular scales in the cmb power spectrum we use cmb data from acbar @xcite and boomerang @xcite .      large scale structure surveys probe the matter distribution in the universe by measuring the galaxy - galaxy power spectrum @xmath22 . in the linear perturbation regime",
    "it is expected that this galaxy - galaxy spectrum is proportional to the total matter power spectrum , @xmath23 , through the simple relation @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is called the bias parameter .",
    "there are two galaxy surveys of comparable size , namely the 2 degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2df ) @xcite and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite . in our analysis",
    "we use data from both these surveys .",
    "probing the luminosity - redshift relation of snia is one of the most direct measurements of cosmological expansion , and thus one of the most powerful pieces of evidence for the existence of dark energy . in our analysis",
    "we use sn1a data from the supernova legacy survey ( snls ) @xcite , which is a dedicated snia survey currently including 71 snia in the redshift range @xmath26 .",
    "in addition to the cmb , lss and snia data sets mentioned above , we impose priors on the hubble parameter , the baryon content in the universe , and the position of the lss baryonic peak .    from the hubble space telescope key project ( hst ) we have adopted a prior on the hubble parameter of @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the constraint on the baryon density today was chosen to be @xmath28 from big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) @xcite .    from the detection of baryonic acoustic oscillations ( bao ) in the sample of luminous red galaxies ( lrg ) in the sdss survey",
    "@xcite it is also possible to put a constraint on the combination of parameters @xmath29^{1/3 } \\frac{\\sqrt{\\omega_m h_0 ^ 2}}{z},\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the comoving angular diameter distance .",
    "the bao constraint can then be written as @xmath31 where the fit to the neutrino fraction , @xmath32 is given by @xcite .",
    "for @xmath33 we adopt the redshift of a typical lrg in the sdss sample , @xmath34 . for models with non - zero @xmath4 , we substitute @xmath2 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : a ] ) with an effective @xmath2 given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the primordial power spectrum given by @xmath37 and @xmath38 is set to @xmath39 .",
    "we use @xmath40 , which is approximately the scale associated with the baryonic peak in the lrg sample .",
    "our results are robust to changes of @xmath41 around this value , as the preferred values of @xmath4 are small in the models considered here .",
    "the parameter estimation process is based on the publicly available cosmomc code @xcite , using the data and likelihoods described above .    for each model",
    ", we compute the corresponding parameter confidence intervals using three different combinations of data sets , named a , b and c ( see table [ tab : datasets ] ) .",
    "data set a includes the three - year wmap data only ; data set b includes also cmb data from acbar and boomerang ; and data set c also lss and snia data sets and priors from hst , bbn and bao .",
    "as a basic six - parameter cosmological model we use the parameters @xmath42 .",
    "the exact parameter definitions are given by the cosmomc code .",
    "@xmath43 is the ratio of baryons to the total energy density ; @xmath44 is the hubble parameter today ; @xmath45 is the ratio of matter to the total energy density today ; @xmath46 sets the amplitude of the primordial fluctuations ; @xmath2 is the tilt of the primordial power spectrum ; and @xmath47 is the reionization optical depth .",
    "we then extend the six - parameter model by adding the parameters @xmath48 one by one ( except for @xmath4 and @xmath49 which are added simultaneously ) . here",
    ", @xmath4 is the running of @xmath2 , defined in eq.([eq : pdef ] ) ; @xmath49 is the ratio of tensor to scalar fluctuations ; @xmath50 is the sum of the neutrino mass eigenstates , @xmath51 ; @xmath5 is the amount of spatial curvature ; and @xmath6 is the equation of state parameter for dark energy . finally , we vary all 11 parameters simultaneously .    for all combinations of data and parameter sets , we carry out a similar analysis both with the standard wmap likelihood code as provided and with the two modifications described above .",
    ".the different combinations of data sets used in this analysis . [ cols=\"^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      finally we vary all 11 parameters @xmath52 simultaneously .",
    "the results for the parameters @xmath2 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath50 are shown in table [ tab : fullset ] . here",
    "we see that all effects found in the more restricted models above are also present in this extended model .",
    "for @xmath2 the likelihood corrections still result in a mean value that is @xmath53 larger than with the original likelihood .",
    "however , as the uncertainty in @xmath2 is increased ( mainly due to a degeneracy with @xmath4 ) , this shift is not as statistically significant as it was in the six - parameter model in subsection [ sec : sixpar ] .",
    "further , for data set c we see that the preferred value of @xmath2 is in fact not much changed by the modified analysis .",
    "rather , the power spectrum changes are accommodated by a slightly lower value of @xmath4 to account for the smaller power for low @xmath12 s in the cmb power spectrum .    for @xmath4 , there are no significant changes of the preferred values by the 11-parameter model , and we see that @xmath54 is still consistent with the data .    the same is the case for @xmath5 . here the modified analysis shifts the preferred values to slightly more negative values , but with all data sets , @xmath55 remains well within @xmath56 of its mean value .",
    "also for @xmath50 we find the same effects as above .",
    "when using cmb data only , the upper limit on @xmath50 is improved by the new wmap likelihood analysis . as expected , the limit becomes weaker for the extended parameter set , but from wmap data alone we still find a @xmath50 limit that is better than what is found in earlier papers , even with this large parameter space .",
    "also , we see that the @xmath50 limit still becomes weaker by adding the acbar and boomerang data sets .    for the dark energy equation of state , we still find that the modified analysis prefer slightly lower values for @xmath6 . in this extended model the preferred values of @xmath6",
    "are shifted to lower values than in the more restricted model in subsection [ sec : w ] , which is mainly accommodated by the preferred negative value of @xmath5 ( as @xmath6 and @xmath5 shifts the positions of the acoustic peaks in opposite directions ) .",
    "still @xmath57 remains within @xmath56 for all of the data sets .    in figure",
    "[ fig : powerspectrum ] , we show the best - fit power spectrum for the 11-parameter the model both from the analysis with the standard wmap likelihood code and the new point - source and low-@xmath12 corrected likelihood analysis . we see that the discrepancy is most notable for @xmath58 .",

    "in refs .  @xcite and @xcite , two modifications to the three - year wmap likelihood were presented .",
    "relative to the power spectrum presented by hinshaw @xcite , they found a power deficit for low values of @xmath12 due to inaccurate likelihood approximation , and a small power excess for high values of @xmath12 due to over - subtracted unresolved point sources .",
    "the impact on the inferred cosmological parameter intervals from these corrections in a minimal six - parameter model was studied in ref.@xcite using cmb data only .",
    "their single most important result was an increase in the preferred value of @xmath2 , lowering the significance of @xmath102 from @xmath103 to @xmath104 . in the present paper , we have extended that analysis to also account for cosmological models including a non - zero running of @xmath2 , massive neutrinos , curvature and @xmath105 .",
