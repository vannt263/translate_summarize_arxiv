    "spectra were obtained with the following telescopes and spectrographs : eso 1.5 m ( b&ch ) , san pedro martir 2.2 m ( b&ch ) , calar alto 2.2 m ( b&ch ) , kpno 2.2 m ( gold ) , and asiago 1.82 m ( b&ch ) .",

    "spectra were taken with very similar instrumental setups yielding resolution in the range 4 - 7   fwhm .",
    "the s / n of our spectra is typically in the range @xmath0 20 - 40 ( minimum 12 ) .",
    "the high s / n and the moderate resolution make this sample appropriate for the study of line shifts because fwhm and shift measures are not significantly affected by undersampling .",

    "the sample standard deviation is @xmath11135  .",
    "the median value is @xmath12 7  .",
    "50% of the measurements fall in the interval from @xmath1349 to @xmath1416 , so we adopt the first and third quartile as confidence limits , @xmath15 . the central bins of our  distribution are dominated by measurement errors , with typical values estimated to be in the range 4050  at 1 @xmath16 confidence level .",

    ", it is difficult to doubt the detection of such large displacements in _ both _ [ ] 4959 and [ ] 5007 relative to the reference frame defined by  ( figure 2 ) .",
    "we are able to measure the radial velocity of both  and [ ] @xmath204959 including those with low equivalent width .",
    "the velocities are always consistent within 100 and the equivalent width ratio of  and [ ] @xmath204959 is about 3:1 for the blue outliers , as expected ( see table 1 ) .",
    "this and the fact that the shifts as well as the equivalent widths are different from sources to source , indicates that the  lines , although weak , are not strongly affected by the  subtraction .",
    "we further cheched with subtraction of a theoretical template in the region 4800 - 5100   ( sigut & pradhan , 2002 ) , and the results , shown in fig . 2 ,",
    "are very similar .",
    "one of the seven blue outliers ( i zw1 ) has reliable independent host galaxy redshift determinations based on hi 21  cm and molecular co observations ( see e.g. , schniger & sofue 1994 ) .",
    "this is likely to be an accurate and reliable rest frame determination for at least three reasons : 1 ) the hi and co lines profiles match very closely in shape , width and centroid velocity , 2 ) the profiles are symmetric and 3 ) the profiles are steep sided double horns .",
    "the centroid measures are consistent with the velocity of the peak of the h@xmath1 emission line profile and not with [ oiii ] .",
    "sources with fwhm ( ) @xmath3 4000  show a sharply peaked , lorentzian  profile .",
    "in such cases the narrow line component is uncertain because no profile inflection is seen .",
    "even if the  profile is completely ascribed to the broad component , it seems that the  peak is nonetheless a good estimator of the quasar systemic velocity ( this result is expected if the line comes from an extended accretion disk ) .",
    "we might expect to detect a _ blueshifted _  analog to the [ oiii ] lines , but given the low equivalent width w ( ) we normally expect w()/w ( ) @xmath21 10 ) , such a blueshifted component will be lost in the noise .",
    "we also attempted to identify red outliers ( there are seven objects with @xmath22 150 which form an extended red tail in the shift distribution ) . in all cases , we find that the top of  is complex or even multi - peaked .",
    "this means that the use of  as a reference is sometimes ambiguous .",
    "independent rest frame measures for two of these sources are consistent with an [ oiii ] derived radial velocity . we therefore interpret figure 1a as consistent with three populations : 1 ) a scatter population associated in part with measurement errors ; 2 ) a real , but relatively rare population of sources where  shows an intrinsic large blue shift relative to the local rest frame ( the blue outliers ) ; 3 ) an intermediate population , in the range -250 @xmath17 @xmath3 -100 ) , probably containing both sources with intrinsic blue shifts and sources with larger  uncertainty .",
    "the preferred location of the blue outliers in e1 motivated us to search for corroboration among samples of phenomenologically similar ( see next section ) sources .",
    "grupe , thomas & leighly ( 2001 ) identify a blueshift of 570  in rxj2217 - 59",
    ". our quick look of other ( feii corrected ) spectra ( grupe et al . 1999 ) revealed at least three other sources with obvious blueshifts in the range -300 to -500   ( rxj1036 - 35 , rxj 2340 - 53 and ms2340 - 15 ) .",
    "further insight and confidence about the reality of blue outliers can be gained from considering the distribution in the eigenvector 1 diagrams ( sulentic et al .",
    "the principal physical driver of e1 is assumed to be the luminosity - to - mass ratio ( @xmath23 accretion rate ) convolved with source orientation ( marziani et al .",
    "2001 ) and/or the black hole mass ( boroson 2002 ; zamanov & marziani 2002 ) . the distribution of blue outliers in the e1 optical plane fig .",
    "1c ) is obviously different from that of the general agn population .",
    "the blue outliers occupy the lower right part of the diagram and are exclusively population a / nlsy1 ( fwhm()@xmath3 4000 ) sources .",
    "a 2d kolmogorov - smirnov ( see e.g. fasano & franceschini , 1987 ) suggests that the parameter space occupation of the _ blue _ outliers is significantly different than the majority of agn at a confidence level of 0.990@xmath130.999 .",
    "the preferred location of the blue outliers in e1 motivated us to search for other [ oiii ] blueshifts among samples of phenomenologically similar sources .",

    "our quick look of other ( feii corrected ) spectra ( grupe et al . 1999 ) revealed at least three other sources with obvious blueshifts in the range -300 to -500   ( rxj1036 - 35 , rxj 2340 - 53 and ms2340 - 15 ) .    figure 3 in sulentic et al ( 2000a ) involving  centroid shift vs. fwhm h@xmath1 shows a striking similarity to figure 1b of this paper .",
    "there is a hil blueshift in the same agn ( population a ) where we find all of the blue outliers .",
    "the simplest interpretation is that we are seeing a kinematic linkage between blr and nlr hil .",
    "a source by source comparison reveals 5 of 7 blue outliers with hst fos archival spectra of the  line .",
    "the blue outliers show civ blueshifts ( at fwhm ( ) ) between v@xmath24503 and @xmath131936 .",
    "this motivates us to look at all sources in our full sample with civ shift ( @xmath25600 km / s ) and w[oiii ] ( @xmath2615@xmath27 ) , properties similar to the blue outliers .",
    "we find 12 additional sources where : 1 ) no narrow h@xmath1 peak and/or [ oiii ] line is observed ( sometimes simply due to noisier than average spectra ) , 2 ) smaller , likely significant,[oiii ] blueshifts are observed ( e.g. -200 km / s for pg1444 + 407 ) and 3 ) a peak+blue wing structure is observed . in the numerous latter cases we see a narrow unshifted [ oiii ] line with a strong blue wing . in the absence of the peak we would measure a blueshift in the blue outlier velocity range .",
    "this motivates us to propose that the blue outliers represent sources where the classical extended nlr is absent or suppressed .",
    "the peak+ blue wing cases represent sources where both the ( usually strong ) classical and the ( usually weak ) blue shifted nlr components are present .",
    "the concept of two distinct nlr components is reenforced by sources like ngc7213 ( busko & steiner 1988 ) and rxj0148 - 27 ( grupe et al .",
    "1999 ) where the unshifted and the blueshifted [ oiii ] components are actually resolved .",
    "an obvious question involves whether or not the  blue outliers are peculiar agn  a new , previously unknown agn class .",
    "they do not appear to be part of a continuous distribution of  velocity shifts .",
    "however , even if the distribution of  outliers is not consistent with the other agn in the e1 parameter plane , blue outliers lie near an extremum in the agn occupied domain rather than outside of it . if we consider our tentative grid of expected l / m and i values in the e1 plane ( marziani et al .",
    "2001 ) , we see that the blue outliers may be the product of special circumstances : 1 ) a large l / m ratio , and 2 ) a small inclination ( i@xmath280@xmath29 ) . of course these two circumstances",
    "do not explain the absence of the classical nlr .",
    "one possibility is 3 ) that these sources are young quasars ( see below ) .",
    "it has been suggested that radio - quiet nlsy1 are the equivalent of bl lacs .",
    "we infer that our blue outliers ( the ones observed almost face - on , with largest  and  blueshifts ) may be the radio - quiet analogous of bl lac .",
    "we note that the single rl blue outlier identified pks0736 + 01 involves an optically violently variable ( ovv ) quasar .",
    "we constructed a purely kinematical model in which  and  are both assumed to arise in a radial flow constrained in a cone of half - opening angle @xmath30  ( e.g. a high ionization , optically thin wind ) where the receding part of the flow is obscured by an optically thick accretion disk ( i.e. , we are able to see the approaching part of the flow and the near side of the disk which is assumed to emit ) .",
    "we assumed that radial motions in the gas were a fixed fraction ( 1.5 ) of the local virial velocity .",
    "we integrated over a region 100 @xmath31   for  and over a region 300 @xmath32  for , with emissivity power law - indices q = -2 ( ) and q = -1 ( ) .",
    "[ model ] shows the resulting model profiles for a viewing angle i@xmath0 15@xmath29 .",
    "the width and shift of both lines are accounted for .",
    "we suggest , without considering this particular model as a physical one , that emission from outflowing gas , possibly associated to a disk wind , can explain the observed profiles .",
    "the occurrence of large   shifts seems to be associated with low w ( ) .",
    "our model integration also consistently suggests _ a very compact _ nlr ( r@xmath21 1 pc for a black hole mass 10@xmath33  solar masses ) . in this case , the receding part of the outflow may be more easily hidden by an optically thick disk extending to @xmath21 1 pc ( this is a requirement also to avoid double peaked profiles ) .",
    "the filling factor needed to explain the  luminosity of i zw 1 and pg 1543 + 489 can be reasonably small , @xmath34 .",
    "it is intriguing that a compact nlr complements several lines of evidence suggesting that nlsy1s are young agn .",
    "large w ( ) would imply a larger emitting volume and hence may be associated with lower  shifts .",
    "the frequent observations of blueward asymmetry close to the  line profile base indicates that the same outflow may also be occurring in the innermost nlr of agn with larger w ( ) .",
    "it is also interesting to note that broad absorption line qsos ( bal qsos ) are found more frequently in samples with low w ( ) ( boroson & meyers 1992 ; turnshek et al . 1997 ) .",
    "we do not find any bal qso among the outliers .",
    "in addition , the known low - z bal qso in our sample ( pg 1004 + 13 , pg 2112 + 059 ) with measurable  ( 2 out of 5 ) show shifts  @xmath21 0 . this is also consistent with orientation playing a role and with blue outliers being oriented predominantly `` face - on . '' on the contrary , the  absorption / emission profiles of bal qsos suggest that they may be observed far from pole - on ( marziani et al .",
    "2002 , in preparation ) .",
    "we find that the  and   lines provide measures of the radial velocity of agn usually consistent within @xmath11200 .",
    "we identified infrequent ( @xmath0 5% in a sample of 200 sources ) agn showing @xmath3 -250 .",
    "they belong to the extreme population a sources that also show a large broad line  blueshift .",
    "this kinematic coupling of the nlr and blr hil emission most likely involves a wind or outflow .",
    "our analysis suggests that blue outliers are not peculiar objects , but rather agn viewed of extreme l / m with a compact nlr .",
    "a predominance of blueshifts in the sample indicates that  peak velocity is affected by outflow motions occurring in the innermost nlr .",
