    "no direct observation of the universe during the period between the recombination epoch at redshift @xmath3 and the reionization epoch at @xmath1 as yet been reported . while a number of suggestions for the future detection of the reionization epoch , itself , have been made , this period prior to the formation of the first stars and quasars  the cosmic `` dark ages ''  has been more elusive .",
    "standard big - bang cosmology in the cdm model predicts that nonlinear baryonic structure first emerges during this period , with virialized halos of dark and baryonic matter which span a range of masses from less than @xmath4 to about @xmath5 which are filled with neutral hydrogen atoms .",
    "the atomic density @xmath6 and kinetic temperature @xmath7 of the gas are high enough that collisions populate the hyperfine levels of the ground state of these atoms in a ratio close to that of their statistical weight ( 3:1 ) , with a spin temperature @xmath8 that greatly exceeds the excitation temperature @xmath9 .",
    "since @xmath10 , the temperature of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , as well , for the majority of halos , these `` minihalos '' can be a detectable source of redshifted 21-cm emission .",
    "the direct detection of minihalos at such high redshift would be an unprecedented measure of the density fluctuations in the baryons and of the total matter power spectrum at small scales .",
    "the results presented here are described in more detail in @xcite .",
    "the 21-cm emission from a single halo depends upon its internal atomic density , temperature , and velocity structure .",
    "we model each cdm minihalo here as a nonsingular , truncated isothermal sphere ( `` tis '' ) of dark matter and baryons in virial and hydrostatic equilibrium , in good agreement with the results of gas and n - body simulations from realistic initial conditions @xcite .",
    "the minihalos which contribute significantly to the 21-cm emission span a mass range from @xmath11 to @xmath12 which varies with redshift .",
    "@xmath11 is close to the jeans mass @xmath13 of the uncollapsed igm prior to reionization , while @xmath12 is the mass for which @xmath14 according to the tis model @xcite . typically , at @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , depending upon the cosmological model .",

    "line profiles of different minihalos along the same line of sight should not typically overlap .",
    "the proper mean free path for photons to encounter minihalos in @xmath2cdm is 160 kpc at @xmath15 @xcite , corresponding to a frequency separation @xmath22 .",
    "these results predict a `` 21-cm forest '' of minihalo emission lines . at @xmath15 ,",
    "for example , there are about 160 lines per unit redshift along a typical line of sight@xcite .",
    "detecting the stronger lines would require sub - arcsecond spatial resolution , @xmath23 frequency resolution , and @xmath24njy sensitivity .",
    "ska is expected to have sufficient resolution for such observations , but probably not sufficient sensitivity .",
    "the minihalos which produce the `` 21-cm forest '' of emission lines described above have appreciable optical depth to 21-cm absorption .",
    "the same minihalos will therefore produce a `` 21-cm forest '' of _ absorption _ lines , too , in the spectra of radio continuum sources if the latter are discovered at high redshift ( @xmath25 ) , prior to the end of the reionization epoch .",
    "we plot illustrative 21-cm absorption line profiles for absorbing minihalos of different masses at @xmath26 in figure  [ martel_ea]b .",

    "the beam - averaged differential temperature @xmath28 within a given beam of angular size @xmath29 is calculated by integrating our results for individual minihalos over the press - schechter mass function of minihalos sampled by the beam .",

    "the angular fluctuations in this emission , on the other hand , should be much easier to detect .",
    "the amplitude of @xmath43-@xmath40 angular fluctuations ( i.e. @xmath43 times the rms value ) in the differential antenna temperature is given in the linear regime by @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the rms density fluctuation at redshift @xmath46 in a randomly placed cylinder which corresponds to the observational volume defined by the detector angular beam size , @xmath29 , and frequency bandwidth , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 is the bias factor which accounts for the clustering of rare density peaks relative to the mass .",
    "illustrative results are plotted for 3-@xmath40 fluctuations as a function of @xmath29 for @xmath35 and 8.5 , in figure  [ martel3 + 4]a , along with the expected sensitivity limits for the planned lofar ( 300 m filled aperture ) and ska ( 1 km filled aperture ) arrays .",
