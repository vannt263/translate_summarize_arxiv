    "in this talk i discuss phenomenological consequences of qcd improved partonic structure of longitudinally polarized virtual photons ( @xmath0 ) , concentrating on lo qcd calculations of dijet production in ep collisions at hera .",
    "some of the results presented here are discussed in detail in @xcite . the role of resolved @xmath0 in nlo qcd calculations",
    "will be addressed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "i start by recalling the virtue of extending the concept of partonic `` structure '' to virtual photons @xcite :    * in principle , the concept of partonic structure of virtual photons can be dispensed with as higher order qcd corrections to cross sections of processes involving virtual photons in the initial state are well  defined and finite even for massless partons . * in practice , however , the concept of _ resolved virtual photon _ is extraordinarily useful as it allows us to include the resummation of higher order qcd effects that come from physically well  understood region of ( almost ) parallel emission of partons off the quarks and antiquarks coming from the primary @xmath1 splitting and subsequently participating in hard processes .    for the virtual photon , as opposed to the real one , its parton distribution functions ( pdf )",
    "can therefore be regarded as `` merely '' describing higher order perturbative effects and not their `` genuine '' structure .",
    "although this distinction between the content of pdf of real and virtual photons exists , it does not affect the _ phenomenological _ usefulness of pdf of the virtual photon . as shown in @xcite",
    "the nontrivial part of the contributions of resolved @xmath2 to nlo calculations of dijet production at hera is large and affects significantly the conclusions of phenomenological analyses of existing experimental data . taking into account resolved @xmath0 turns out to be phenomenologically important as well .",
    "most of the present knowledge of the structure of the photon comes from experiments at ep and e@xmath3e@xmath4 colliders , where the incoming leptons act as sources of transverse ( @xmath2 ) and longitudinal ( @xmath0 ) virtual photons of virtuality @xmath5 and momentum fraction @xmath6 . to order @xmath7",
    "their respective unintegrated fluxes are given as @xmath8 phenomenological analyses of interactions of virtual photons and their pdf have so far concentrated on @xmath2 .",
    "neglecting longitudinal photons is a good approximation for @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , as well as for small virtualities @xmath5 , where pdf of @xmath0 vanish by gauge invariance . but",
    "how small is `` small '' in fact ?",
    "for instance , should we take into account the contribution of @xmath11 to jet cross sections in the region @xmath12 gev , @xmath13 gev@xmath14 , where most of the data on virtual photons obtained in ep collisions at hera come from ?",
    "the present paper is devoted primarily to addressing this question .    in pure qed and to order @xmath7 the probability of finding inside @xmath0 of virtuality @xmath5 a quark with mass @xmath15 , charge @xmath16 , momentum fraction @xmath17 and virtuality @xmath18 ,",
    "is given , in units of @xmath19 , as @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",
    "the quantity defined in ( [ fullresult ] ) has a clear physical interpretation : it describes the flux of quarks that are almost collinear with the incoming photon and `` live '' longer than @xmath22 . for @xmath23 ( [ fullresult ] ) simplifies to @xmath24 which for @xmath25 further reduces to @xmath26 whereas for @xmath27 @xmath28 qcd corrections to qed expressions for pdf of @xmath0 have been derived in leading - logarithmic approximation in the region @xmath29 in @xcite . by `` leading  log ''",
    "i mean resummation of the terms @xmath30 at each order @xmath31 of perturbative qcd .",
    "note that for @xmath2 there is one power of @xmath32 more at each order of @xmath33 , the additional one coming from the primary qed @xmath1 splitting . in the case of @xmath0",
    "the analogous splitting gives rise to `` constant '' term ( [ virtuall ] ) , hence the absence of this log .",
    "the resulting expressions exhibit typical hadronic form of scale dependence and contain @xmath34 as the only free parameter .",
    "qcd effects thus suppress quark distribution functions @xmath35 at large @xmath17 and enhance it on the other hand for @xmath36 .",
    "moreover , they generate sizable gluon distribution function , absent in qed .",
    "the presence of the term proportional to @xmath32 in the expressions for @xmath37 in both qed and qcd implies the dominance of @xmath2 at large @xmath38 , but one would have to go to very large @xmath38 for @xmath0 to become really negligible with respect to @xmath2 . for fixed @xmath38 the relative importance of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath2 grows with @xmath5 , but to retain clear physical meaning of pdf we stay throughout this paper in the region where @xmath39 .",
    "the lower bound @xmath40 ensures that hadronic parts of qcd improved pdf of @xmath0 , which have not been taken into account in @xcite , can be safely neglected .",
    "the relevance of resolved @xmath0 in hard collisions of virtual photons depends on the theoretical framework we are working in . in this talk",
    "i will stay within the framework of lo qcd calculations of dijet production at hera .",
    "( 160,70 ) ( 0,0 ) ( 75,0 )    the measurement of dijet cross sections in ep ( and e@xmath3e@xmath4 ) collisions offers currently the best way of investigating interactions of virtual photons @xcite .",
    "in general the corresponding cross sections are given as sums of contributions of all possible parton level subprocess .",
    "the simplest way of demonstrating the importance of the contributions of resolved @xmath0 employs the approximation @xcite in which dijet cross sections are expressed in terms of single _ effective parton distribution function _ of the photon ( @xmath2 or @xmath0 ) @xmath41 where the factorization scale @xmath42 is conventionally identified with ( a multiple of ) jet @xmath43 : @xmath44 . in fig .",
    "[ eff2 ] the contributions to @xmath45 of @xmath0 , evaluated with both qed and qcd formulae for its pdf , are compared to those of @xmath2 using sas1d parameterization @xcite .",
    "the comparison is performed for two pairs of @xmath5 and @xmath38 typical for hera experiments .",
    "in addition to softening effects at large @xmath17 , qcd improved pdf of @xmath0 give sizable contribution to @xmath45 at small @xmath17 that comes from the gluon content of @xmath0 . fig . [ eff2 ] moreover suggests that in the region accessible at hera the contributions of resolved @xmath0 are numerically important , particularly after incorporating qcd effects in its pdf .",
    "after this simple but approximate estimate of the contributions of resolved @xmath0 , i now turn to the evaluation of dijet cross sections at hera using complete lo qcd formalism as implemented in herwig 5.9 event generator . to include the effects of resolved @xmath0",
    "i have added the option of generating the flux of @xmath0 combined with the call to qed or qcd improved pdf of @xmath0 .",
    "for @xmath2 the sas1d pdf @xcite were used .",
    "the dijet cross sections were evaluated for @xmath46 in three windows of @xmath5 @xmath47 and imposing the following cuts on jet @xmath43 ( all quantities are in @xmath48p cms ) @xmath49 the effects of h1 and zeus detector acceptances were taken into account by performing all calculations without any restrictions on @xmath50 as well for @xmath51 .",
    "the results presented in figs .",
    "[ qcd11 ] and [ limqcd11 ] correspond to parton level calculations in the first window of @xmath5 , without and with the mentioned cuts on @xmath50 .",
    "the characteristic dependence of the contributions of resolved @xmath0 on @xmath6 is illustrated by plotting for each of the distributions in @xmath52 and @xmath53 also its ratio to that of @xmath2 for the whole interval @xmath46 , as well as for three indicated subintervals . except for @xmath53 close to @xmath54 ,",
    "qcd improved pdf of @xmath0 enhance its contributions to dijet cross sections compared to those based on the purely qed . for @xmath55",
    "they amount to about @xmath56 of those of @xmath2 . for @xmath57",
    "this number increases further up to about @xmath58 .",
    "reducing the range of @xmath50 to @xmath59 affects mainly the distribution @xmath60 by suppressing it at both edges of the phase space .",
    "the ratia of the contributions of @xmath0 and @xmath2 are , however , affected only little by this cut .    increasing the photon virtuality @xmath5 enhances , approximately uniformly in the whole phase space , the relative importance of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath2 . on the contrary",
    ", rising the threshold @xmath61 from @xmath62 gev to @xmath63 gev reduces it by a factor of about 2 , since large @xmath43 require large @xmath53 , where quarks from @xmath2 dominate .",
    "the effects of hadronization on parton level results discussed above have been studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "they are reasonably small ( @xmath64% ) and model independent in the region @xmath65 but turn large and model dependent below that value . for the comparison with theoretical calculations the lower limit on accessible range of @xmath50 enforced by h1 and zeus acceptances",
    "presents therefore no real restriction . on the other hand",
    ", it would be very useful to push the upper limit on @xmath50 above @xmath66 since the relevance of @xmath0 grows with @xmath50 .",
    "summarizing the message of this section , we conclude that for @xmath67 :    * the contributions of @xmath0 are substantial , particularly for small @xmath6 , large @xmath5 , low @xmath43 and small @xmath53 . *",
    "the cuts enforced by h1 and zeus acceptances reduce the sensitivity to @xmath0 , but its contributions still make up typically @xmath56 of those of @xmath2 and can be identified by their characteristic @xmath6 and @xmath5 dependencies .",
    "the contributions of resolved @xmath0 to dijet production in ep collisions at hera were evaluated using qcd improved pdf of @xmath0 constructed recently . in the region accessible at hera they turn out to sizable , amounting typically to @xmath68% of those from @xmath2 , and depend sensitively of @xmath69 and @xmath53 .",
