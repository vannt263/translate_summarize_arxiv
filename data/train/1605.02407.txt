    "the study of hadron spectroscopy has made significant progress during the past decade benefiting from the experimental observations of a lot of new states in various processes . in particular , in the heavy flavor sector , a large number of the so - called @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 states have been candidates for exotic hadrons which may contain more complicated quark - gluon structures than the conventional quark model picture . among all those exotic candidates ,",
    "the @xmath0 is undoubtedly one of the most mysterious states and has initiated a lot of experimental and theoretical studies since its observation by babar collaboration in the @xmath12 channel in 2005  @xcite .",
    "it was later confirmed by belle  @xcite and cleo - c collaboration  @xcite in the same decay channel , but  evaded \" from observation in its decays into open charm channels  @xcite which is unexpected for conventional charmonium states above the @xmath13 threshold .",
    "nevertheless , in the @xmath14 value measurement the inclusive cross sections for @xmath1 annihilations appear to have a dip instead of a peak in the vicinity of the @xmath0 mass region .",
    "another important observation which makes @xmath0 peculiar is that the successful potential quark model calculations did not predict a vector state in such an energy region and the conventional @xmath3 states have been assigned to other structures  @xcite .",
    "such surprising properties have initiated a lot of theoretical interpretations of its nature in the literature , such as vector hybrid candidate refs .",
    "@xcite , hadro - quarkonium  @xcite , tetraquark state  @xcite , and hadronic molecules of @xmath2  @xcite , @xmath15  @xcite , or @xmath16",
    "@xcite , or non - resonance explanation due to state interferences  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath0 was proposed to be a conventional charmonium @xmath17 state .",
    "interestingly , the lattice qcd ( lqcd ) calculation indicates that the hybrid vector charmonium is located in the mass region near 4.3 gev which makes the @xmath0 a possible hybrid state corresponding to the lqcd spectrum  @xcite . in the recent lqcd study of ref .",
    "@xcite a spatially extended hybrid - like operator is applied and yields a rather small leptonic decay width of less than 40 ev .",
    "it makes the measurement of the leptonic decay width an interesting observable for probing its internal structures .",
    "the recent observation of the charged charmonium states @xmath18 at the mass of @xmath0 in @xmath19 with high statistics at besiii  @xcite once again attracted attention from the community and provoked further studies of the @xmath0 .",
    "the mass of the @xmath18 is close to the @xmath20 threshold . with @xmath21",
    "it decays via an @xmath22 wave into @xmath20 and @xmath23 with large coupling to @xmath20 which makes it a reasonable candidate for hadronic molecule of @xmath20 nevertheless , its production from the @xmath0 decays provides important information for the structure of @xmath0 and a detailed studies of the @xmath0 should be crucial for a self - consistent picture for those puzzling phenomena arising in this energy region .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was proposed that the production of @xmath18 in @xmath24 should be a strong signal for @xmath0 being a @xmath2 hadronic molecule .",
    "one notices that the @xmath2 is the first two - body open charm @xmath22-wave threshold in the vector charmonium channel with narrow final states and the @xmath0 is less than 30 mev below the @xmath2 threshold .",
    "it should be pointed out that the mass and width of @xmath0 were extracted by a breit - wigner fit to the @xmath19 cross sections  @xcite .",
    "since the cross section lineshape is not symmetric at the two sides of the peak this treatment may cause significant uncertainties with the resonance parameters .",
    "in fact , the asymmetric lineshape can be regarded as an indication of the nontrivial nature of the @xmath0 of which the propagator can not be parameterized by a simple breit - wigner .",
    "this forms one of the motivations in this study that a proper treatment of the renormalization effects due to the meson loops will be essential for extracting the pole information .    recall that we have been emphasizing that a strong @xmath22-wave interactions between @xmath2 can lead to a dynamically generated pole structure near the @xmath2 threshold and the @xmath0 should be the natural candidate  @xcite . to firm up such a scenario ,",
    "various properties and observables were investigated in the molecular picture . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was studied that the @xmath0 as a @xmath2 molecule will have sizeable decay rate into @xmath25 given that @xmath26 is also a hadronic molecule of @xmath27 one interesting question arising from the @xmath2 molecule picture is that the @xmath28 should be the narrow state in the @xmath29 and @xmath30 mixing for the @xmath31 states .",
    "the data show that the narrow @xmath28 will be dominated by the configuration with the light quark angular momentum @xmath32 coupled by the orbital angular momentum and antiquark spin and parity",
    ". this will be a pure configuration either by taking the heavy quark spin symmetry ( hqss ) limit or if @xmath28 is one of the eigenstate from the @xmath29 and @xmath30 ideal mixing .",
    "it was then pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the hqss limit the coupling of the heavy @xmath3 in an @xmath22 wave of @xmath33 while the light quark degrees of freedom with the spin and orbital angular momentum coupling to @xmath34 is forbidden in the spin decomposition of @xmath2 this observation brings concerns on the production of @xmath0 in @xmath1 annihilations if it is indeed a hadronic molecule of @xmath2 however , as shown by refs .",
    "@xcite , the hqss breaking in the charmonium mass region should be expected and it is sufficient to account for the cross sections observed for @xmath0 .",
    "our studies in this work will further clarify the hqss breaking effects and make the molecular picture dynamically self - contained .    in brief , we will follow the molecular picture of refs .",
    "@xcite and explore the @xmath0 production mechanism in @xmath1 annihilations .",
    "we will try to accommodate the short - distance production mechanism coherently in the molecular picture using weinberg s compositeness theorem  @xcite .",
    "this will quantify the hqss breaking effects in explicit calculation and this treatment should be able to tell us more about the structure of the @xmath0 .",
    "as follows , we first present the full propagator of the @xmath0 in the framework of the non - relativistic effective field theory ( nreft ) in sec .",
    "[ nreft - propagator ] . in sec .",
    "[ lineshape - study ] we present the formalism for the study of the cross section lineshape of @xmath4 and the width of @xmath35 .",
    "we then investigate the hqss breaking effects in the @xmath6 model as an independent check of the hqss breaking in sec .",
    "[ 3p0-model ] .",
    "a brief summary is given in sec .",
    "[ summary ] .",
    "in our scenario @xmath0 is treated as an @xmath36wave molecule of @xmath37 containing a small charmonium component @xmath38 , i.e. @xmath39 . for the @xmath40 scattering ( the conjugate part is implicated ) , the contact interaction is also introduced in addition to the bare pole structure .",
    "the process for the decay of @xmath41 and scattering of @xmath42 are illustrated in fig .",
    "the corresponding lagrangian can be written as @xmath43 where the real coefficient @xmath44 is the coupling constant of the contact interaction .    in the molecular scenario",
    "the non - relativistic propagator of the @xmath0 can be expressed as @xmath45}\\nonumber\\\\ & \\equiv & \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{i}{e - m_0-\\sigma_1(e ) } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the bare mass of @xmath0 and @xmath47 comes from the sum of the infinite bubble loops in the @xmath40 rescattering .",
    "the one loop function is defined as the following : @xmath48 in dimensional regularization with the @xmath49 subtraction scheme , the loop integral @xmath50 is finite for @xmath51 and one obtains @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the reduced mass .",
    "the bare mass @xmath46 should be renormalized to the physical mass @xmath54 , which gives the physical pole position in the real axis of the energy plane via @xmath55 .    by expanding the denominator of the propagator near the physical pole position of @xmath54",
    ", the propagator can be expressed as @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 $ ] is the wavefunction renormalization constant .",
    "note that @xmath59 is the probability of finding @xmath0 in a @xmath37 molecular state .",
    "it can then be related to the molecular component of the @xmath0 wavefunction via @xmath60 .",
    "alternatively , the renormalization constant @xmath11 defines the probability of finding the @xmath0 in a non - molecular state .",
    "a natural assumption is that @xmath11 can be related to the compact @xmath3 component in the @xmath0 wavefunction and at leading order one expects @xmath61 .",
    "it should be emphasized that this renormalization will allow constraints on the production of @xmath0 via the short - distance component , e.g. in the @xmath1 annihilations .",
    "this also implies that @xmath62 should be one of the important decay channels of @xmath0 .",
    "however , notice that the @xmath63-wave decay of @xmath5 is suppressed .",
    "the partial width of @xmath64 is not expected to be sizeable .",
    "a detailed study is necessary for a coherent picture for the nature of @xmath0 .",
    "we also introduce a constant width @xmath65 in the propagator to account for contributions from decay channels other than the @xmath37 then the complete propagator of @xmath0 reads @xmath66 where @xmath54 and @xmath65 are parameters to be fitted by experimental data for the cross section lineshapes of @xmath19 and @xmath67 . as studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , the asymmetric cross section lineshape of @xmath19 turns out to be selective for the determination of the pole position @xmath54 and @xmath65 .",
    "thus , by fitting the cross section lineshapes of @xmath19 and @xmath67 , but allowing an overall scale parameter , we can determine @xmath68 gev and @xmath69 gev  @xcite .",
    "we note that the pole corresponding to @xmath0 is close to the threshold of @xmath37 when considering the pole value of @xmath28 .",
    "this follows the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , namely , the renormalization constant @xmath11 in the numerator of eq .",
    "( [ propagator - full ] ) was absorbed into the vertex coupling constant as an overall scale parameter .",
    "this is because that the pole is fitted at @xmath70 with @xmath71 , i.e. @xmath72 .",
    "it means that the pole position does not explicitly depend on the renormalization constant .",
    "one notices that @xmath69 gev accounts for the sum of contributions from non-@xmath37 channels .",
    "they include the hidden charm decays , i.e. @xmath12 , @xmath67 , and @xmath15 , and also open charm decays that do not go through the @xmath37 this part of open charm decays reflect the hqss breaking effects for which we will try to quantify in this work later .",
    "it should be noted that the recent experimental measurements of besiii  @xcite suggest that the cross sections for @xmath19 , @xmath67 , and @xmath15 are compatible .",
    "if these channels saturate the total width of @xmath0 , it will lead to relatively small leptonic decay width for @xmath35  @xcite .",
    "this is also a challenge in understanding the nature of @xmath0 .",
    "as follows , we will combine the production mechanism to investigate the relation between the renormalization constant @xmath11 and its implication of relative decay strength for @xmath0 to different decay channels .",
    "the full propagator of eq .",
    "( [ propagator - full ] ) and decomposition of the @xmath0 wavefunction of eq .",
    "( [ decomp ] ) will help us to separate out the short - distance compact @xmath3 component and long - distance molecular component , and also provide constraint on its leptonic decay width .",
    "the production and decay of @xmath0 in @xmath1 annihilations can go through two steps , i.e. the compact @xmath3 component is first created by the virtual photon and then the physical @xmath0 can decay either via the molecular @xmath37 component or the compact @xmath3 into final @xmath62 it can then be illustrated by fig .",
    "[ y - decay ] where ( a ) and ( b ) are decay processes through the molecular component while ( c ) and ( d ) are through the compact @xmath3 which are originated from the hqss breaking .",
    "although there are various interpretations for the @xmath18 , we treat it as an @xmath36wave molecule of @xmath74 in our framework .",

    "the contact interaction of @xmath81 is introduced by the term with coupling @xmath82 in eq .",
    "( [ zcprop ] ) .",
    "however , by fitting the @xmath20 invariant mass spectrum it shows that the value of @xmath82 is negligibly small and so we take @xmath83 in the following analysis .    given that a compact @xmath3 component is present in the wavefunction of @xmath0 , it would be a natural mechanism to produce the @xmath0 in the @xmath1 annihilations .",
    "the coupling of @xmath0 to the virtual photon can be approximated by the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) model , which is described by the following lagrangian for the compact component coupling to the virtual photon : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the bare decay constant defined for the compact wavefunction of @xmath0 .",
    "it should be addressed that the compact @xmath3 in an @xmath22 wave should decouple to the @xmath37 molecular component in the hqss limit  @xcite . however , since the charm quark is not heavy enough the hqss breaking is anticipated and there will be several possible mechanisms leading to mixing between the compact @xmath3 and molecular @xmath37 :    * the presence of the compact @xmath3 component may be produced by the coupled channel between @xmath37 and @xmath86 which allows a small @xmath22-wave coupling for @xmath87 since the @xmath88 state is very broad such a contribution including the @xmath18 pole , i.e. contributions from fig .",
    "[ y - decay ] ( c ) and ( d ) , can be parameterized by an @xmath22-wave coupling amplitude for @xmath89 as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the invariant mass square of @xmath92 and @xmath93 in the final state and @xmath94 and @xmath95 are real numbers to be fitted by the experimental data .",
    "this parametrization  @xcite respects watson theorem and is equivalent to introducing a contact interaction and a pole term to the transition amplitude as illustrated by fig .",
    "[ y - decay ] ( c ) and ( d ) , respectively .",
    "* the coupled channel between @xmath37 and @xmath86 will lead to the hqss breaking and result in the deviation of the @xmath29 and @xmath30 mixing from the ideal mixing .",
    "then , a small @xmath22-wave coupling for @xmath0 to the physical @xmath37 will be allowed .",
    "this mechanism will also affect the decay of @xmath5 where a small @xmath22-wave coupling will contribute to the amplitude of eq .",
