    "the theory of piecewise smooth vector fields ( psvf for short ) has been developing very fast in the last years , mainly due to its strong relation with branches of applied science , such as mechanical , aerospace engineering , electrical and electronic engineering , physics , economics , among others areas .",
    "indeed , psvf are in the boundary between mathematics , physics and engineering , see @xcite and @xcite for a recent survey on this subject .",
    "the psvf are described by piecewise systems of differential equations , so that we have a smooth system defined in regions of the phase portrait .",
    "for some references on this subject , we suggest @xcite .    the common frontier between the regions that separate the smooth vector fields is called switching manifold ( or discontinuity manifold ) .",
    "there are a lot of research being made about the local behavior of psvf near the switching manifold .",
    "for instance , see @xcite for results about bifurcations on psvf , @xcite for stability , @xcite for reversibility and @xcite for applications in relay and control systems .",
    "the mathematical formalization of the theory of psvf was made precise by filippov in @xcite and in this paper we consider his convention .",
    "as usual , we denote the switching manifold by @xmath0 .",
    "the trajectory of the psvf can be confined onto the switching manifold itself , when the trajectories on both sides of the switching manifold slides over the manifold after the meeting , and there remains until reaching the boundary of this ( open ) region , that is called sliding region .",
    "the occurrence of such behavior , known as sliding motion , has been reported in a wide range of applications , especially on relay control systems and systems with dry friction , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there are three distinguished types of regions on the discontinuity manifold : crossing region , attractive sliding region and repulsive sliding region .",
    "these regions fully describes what can happen on such manifold .",
    "one of the biggest limitations of the theory of psvf is the lack of global results , see @xcite . in @xcite , authors considered conditions to get structural stability for psvf defined in a compact differentiable manifolds , like a version of the _ peixoto s",
    "theorem_. however , this paper does not consider a complete analysis of the dynamics in the cases presenting a non - trivial recurrence and tangential singularities on torus or sphere .",
    "in general , almost all results are local , in this way , the switching manifold can be taken as an hyperplane of codimension one .",
    "recently a version of the _ poincar - bendixson theorem _ was proved to piecewise smooth case , see @xcite and therefore we are able to analyse global dynamics in compact manifolds .",
    "let @xmath1 denote the two dimensional torus @xmath2 or the sphere @xmath3 . in both cases , we will consider @xmath1 obtained as the usual quotient of the square @xmath4\\times [ 0,1]$ ] .",
    "consider the switching manifold , denoted by @xmath0 , as @xmath5 for @xmath6 and @xmath7 for @xmath8 .",

    "in this paper we study psvf , denoted by @xmath13 , defined on @xmath1 , with switching manifold @xmath0 : we consider a piecewise smooth vector field @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is defined on @xmath16 , @xmath17 is defined on @xmath18 . over @xmath19",
    "we adopt the filippov s convention .",
    "we provide more details of this in section [ secao teoria basica ] .",
    "our main goal is to describe the global dynamics of @xmath13 in the cases where the singularities of @xmath13 are generic or do not exist ( regular case ) .",
    "the main techniques that we use are the theory of contact between a smooth vector fields with the switching manifold and the dynamics of the first return map , which may be generalized for higher dimensions .    in @xcite and @xcite",
    "are exhibit local normal forms for the two dimensional case .",
    "therefore , we start the study of global dynamics on the two dimensional torus and sphere considering these families ( only codimension zero ) . however , in @xcite are exhibit the normal forms of codimension zero for three dimensional case , where the approach developed in this paper can be adapted .",
    "the main results of this paper characterizes the global dynamics of psvf not locally defined ( out of euclidean spaces ) .",
