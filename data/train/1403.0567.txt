    "the highly reddened planetary nebula abell  48 ( png029.0@xmath400.4 ) and its central star ( cs ) have been the subject of recent spectroscopic studies @xcite .",
    "the cs of abell48 has been classified as wolf ",
    "rayet [ wn5 ] @xcite , where the square brackets distinguish it from the massive wn stars .",
    "abell 48 was first identified as a planetary nebula ( pn ) by @xcite .",
    "however , its nature remains a source of controversy whether it is a massive ring nebula or a pn as previously identified .",
    "recently , @xcite described it as a spectral type of wn6 with a surrounding ring nebula .",
    "but , @xcite concluded from spectral analysis of the cs and the surrounding nebula that abell 48 is rather a pn with a low - mass cs than a massive ( pop i ) wn star .",
    "previously , @xcite also associated the cs of pb8 with [ wn / c ] class .",
    "furthermore , ic4663 is another pn found to possess a [ wn ] star @xcite .    a narrow - band h@xmath5+[nii ]",
    "image of abell  48 obtained by @xcite first showed its faint double - ring morphology .",
    "@xcite identified it as a member of the elliptical morphological class . the h@xmath5 image obtained from the supercosmos sky",
    "survey @xcite shows that the angular dimensions of the shell are about 46@xmath6 38@xmath7 , and are used throughout this paper .",
    "the first integral field spectroscopy of abell  48 shows the same structure in the h@xmath5 emission - line profile .",
    "but , a pair of bright point - symmetric regions is seen in [ nii ] ( see fig.[a48:fig3 ] ) , which could be because of the n@xmath8 stratification layer produced by the photoionization process .",
    "a detailed study of the kinematic and ionization structure has not yet been carried out to date .",
    "this could be due to the absence of spatially resolved observations .",
    ".journal of the ifu observations with the anu 2.3-m telescope . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table  [ a48:tab : temperatures ] lists mean temperatures weighted by the ionic abundances .",
    "both [ n  ii ] and [ o  iii ] doublets , as well as hei lines arise from the same ionization zones , so they should have roughly similar values .",
    "the ionic temperatures increasing towards higher ionization stages could also have some implications for the mean temperatures averaged over the entire nebula .",
    "however , there is a large discrepancy by a factor of 2 between our model and orl empirical value of @xmath9(hei@xmath10 .",
    "this could be due to some temperature fluctuations in the nebula @xcite .",
    "the temperature fluctuations lead to overestimating the electron temperature deduced from cels .",
    "this can lead to the discrepancies in abundances determined from cels and orls ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , the temperature discrepancy can also be produced by bi - abundance models @xcite , containing some cold hydrogen - deficient material , highly enriched in helium and heavy elements , embedded in the diffuse warm nebular gas of normal abundances .",
    "the existence and origin of such inclusions are still unknown .",
    "it is unclear whether there is any link between the assumed h - poor inclusions in pne and the h - deficient css .",
    "we have constructed a photoionization model for the nebula of abell  48 .",
    "this consists of a dense hollow cylinder , assuming homogeneous abundances .",
    "the three - dimensional density distribution was interpreted using the morpho - kinematic model determined from spatially resolved kinematic maps and the isw model .",
    "our aim was to construct a model that can reproduce the nebular emission - line spectra , temperatures and ionization structure determined from the observations .",
    "we have used the non - lte model atmosphere from @xcite as the ionizing source . using the empirical analysis methods , we have determined the temperatures and the elemental abundances from cels and orls .",
    "we notice a discrepancy between temperatures estimated from @xmath11o  iii@xmath12 $ ] cels and those from the observed hei orls",
    ". in particular , the abundance ratios derived from empirical analysis could also be susceptible to inaccurate values of electron temperature and density .",
    "however , we see that the predicted ionic abundances are in decent agreement with those deduced from the empirical analysis .",
    "the emission - line fluxes obtained from the model were in fair agreement with the observations .",
    "we notice large discrepancies between hei electron temperatures derived from the model and the empirical analysis .",
    "the existence of clumps and low - ionization structures could solve the problems @xcite .",
    "temperature fluctuations have been also proposed to be responsible for the discrepancies in temperatures determined from cels and orls @xcite .",
    "previously , we also saw large orl ",
    "cel abundance discrepancies in other pne with hydrogen - deficient css , for example abell  30 @xcite and ngc  1501 @xcite .",
    "a fraction of h - deficient inclusions might produce those discrepancies , which could be ejected from the stellar surface during a very late thermal pulse ( vltp ) phase or born - again event @xcite .",
    "however , the vltp event is expected to produce a carbon - rich stellar surface abundance @xcite , whereas in the case of abell  48 negligible carbon was found at the stellar surface ( c / he  =  @xmath13 by mass ; * ? ? ?",
    "the stellar evolution of abell  48 still remains unclear and needs to be investigated further .",
    "but , its extreme helium - rich atmosphere ( 85 per cent by mass ) is more likely connected to a merging process of two white dwarfs as evidenced for r cor bor stars of similar chemical surface composition by observations @xcite and hydrodynamic simulations @xcite .",
    "we derived a nebula ionized mass of @xmath14  m@xmath2 .",
    "the high c / o ratio indicates that it is a predominantly c - rich nebula .",
    "the c / h ratio is largely over - abundant compared to the solar value of @xcite , while oxygen , sulphur and argon are under - abundant .",
    "moreover , nitrogen and neon are roughly similar to the solar values . assuming a sub - solar metallicity progenitor , a 3rd dredge - up",
    "must have enriched carbon and nitrogen in agb - phase . however , extremely high carbon must be produced through mixing processing in the he - rich layers during the he - shell flash .",
    "the low n / o ratio implies that the progenitor star never went through the hot bottom burning phase , which occurs in agb stars with initial masses more than 5m@xmath2 @xcite . comparing the stellar parameters found by the model , @xmath0=70kk and @xmath15l@xmath2=  5500 , with vltp evolutionary tracks from @xcite",
    ", we get a current mass of @xmath16 , which originated from a progenitor star with an initial mass of @xmath17",
    ". however , the vltp evolutionary tracks by @xcite yield a current mass of @xmath18 and a progenitor mass of @xmath19 , which is not consistent with the derived nebula ionized mass .",
    "furthermore , time - scales for vltp evolutionary track @xcite imply that the cs has a post - agb age of about @xmath209000 yr , in agreement with the nebula s age determined from the kinematic analysis .",
    "we therefore conclude that abell  48 originated from an @xmath3  m@xmath2 progenitor , which is consistent with the nebula s features .",
