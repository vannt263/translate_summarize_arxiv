    "returning to the quantum state tomography , lemma [ lem : isostatistic ] implies that the stokes parameter space @xmath0 endowed with the dualistic structure @xmath172 can be identified with the statistical manifold @xmath103 of product distributions .",
    "combining this fact with the results in the previous subsection , we have the following    [ cor : stokesmle ] the mle @xmath43 that satisfies @xmath194 is the @xmath168-projection from the temporal estimate @xmath26 to the bloch ball @xmath12 in the stokes parameter space @xmath0 .    .",
