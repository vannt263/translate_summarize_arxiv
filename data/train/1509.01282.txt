    "the catenary , or hanging chain , is one of the oldest problems in analytical mechanics . in the late 17th century , hooke identified its shape with that of an inverted arch . in keeping with scientific customs of his time , he hid this knowledge in a very long anagram , appended as filler to an unrelated work on helioscopes @xcite .",
    "not long after , in response to a challenge by jacob bernoulli , the solution was found independently by johann bernoulli , huygens , and leibniz @xcite . in the mid-19th century , the catenaries were recognized to be solutions of a broader dynamical problem , namely that of determining the shape equilibria of a moving string subjected to a uniform body force .",
    "this was perhaps first recognized by a tripos examiner in 1854 , one of whose victims , routh , incorporated the fact in a mechanics text a few years later @xcite . by that time",
    ", the discovery had also been made by airy ( astronomer royal ) and thomson ( lord kelvin ) , whose impetus to study this problem was the massive failure of the first attempt to lay transatlantic telegraph cable @xcite .",
    "their treatments of the effects of the fluid medium fell short , with airy modeling drag as isotropic with respect to the cable geometry , and kelvin neglecting it entirely .",
    "as shapes , the catenaries are a family of curves with a single scaling parameter that can effectively describe the length of a string hung , or arching , between two points .",
    "additional axial flow along the tangents of the curve serves only to increase the tension in the string , leaving shape equilibria intact .",
    "the tension increase has consequences for the stability of equilibria , as has been observed in translating belts @xcite and in the `` chain fountain '' phenomenon @xcite .",
    "to the symmetry of the system under axial flow , we may add another under uniform translations of the curve , which correspond to galilean boosts that affect neither the shape nor the tension .    in this paper",
    ", we extend these classical results to include the effects of linear , anisotropic drag forces , such as would arise if the translating , axially flowing catenary were immersed in a highly viscous fluid .",
    "the presence of fluid breaks multiple symmetries and turns the one - parameter family of catenary curves into a five - parameter family .",
    "the additional parameters beyond scaling are the magnitude and direction of the translational velocity , the magnitude of the axial velocity , and the anisotropy of the drag forces .",
    "we find that , in contrast to symmetry breaking by gyroscopic means @xcite , some symmetry still remains , in that inertial forces continue to only affect the string s tension , not its shape .",
    "this is because coriolis terms are absent in our problem ; centripetal contributions to inertia behave identically in both cases .",
    "slender bodies immersed in fluid may be encountered across a wide range of scales in the industrial and natural worlds .",
    "high - altitude power devices and offshore structures rely on pendant tethers , mooring lines , risers , and umbilical cables loaded by currents of air and water . towed cable systems are widely used for retrieval and sensing under the ocean .",
    "some aquatic and terrestrial plants bend and twist to avoid damage or uprooting , and the flexibility of such structures suggests adaptive motifs for drag reduction or control @xcite .",
    "biofilm streamers form at high @xcite and low @xcite reynolds number .",
    "chemical and fluidic applications may employ microscopic wall - mounted tubes or rods in shear or other non - uniform flows @xcite .",
    "suspensions of fibers at low reynolds number arise in classical and industrial sedimentation problems @xcite .",
    "other examples include spinning yarn @xcite , bacterial flagella @xcite , and the ballooning threads of migrating spiders @xcite .",
    "these systems often involve nonlinear drag forces , nonlocal effects , nonuniform flows , and bending stiffness , which are complications we do not address in this paper . before tackling such problems",
    ", it behoves us to consider our simple system , and try to use our conclusions as a basis for generalization .",
    "our augmented catenaries are generically planar curves , and admit an analytical description as a first - order dynamical system for the tangential angle , with arc length as the independent variable .",
    "this suggests an approach to organizing our results , by classifying the corresponding phase space in terms of the presence and location of fixed points and poles .",
    "we illustrate the role of the several parameters on the solutions .",
    "we also discuss the nature of the string tension , which , surprisingly , undergoes its own bifurcations in a manner noncoincident with those of the phase portraits .",
    "our discovery and exposition of the solutions is aided by our initial disregard for any specific physical boundary conditions or integral constraints , which are connected to the axes of our parameter space only through implicit integral relationships . however , towards the end of the paper , we discuss several boundary value problems in which practical parameters like the positions of end points and the total length of the curve are specified .",
    "the general solution we consider covers several interesting problems as limiting cases . aside from the classical catenary , we may use our results to examine the towing of a neutrally buoyant cable ( or , equivalently , such a cable tethered in a uniform flow ) , the reeling in and out of a belt or `` lariat chain '' @xcite between two points , or the free sedimentation of a perfectly flexible filament .",
    "one limit , that of a string snaking along its own tangents under the action of drag forces alone , is a singular axis of our parameter space , admitting only the very restricted set of straight - line solutions . in contrast",
    ", the hypersurface in parameter space where drag anisotropy vanishes is a degenerate case , admitting arbitrary shapes as freely sedimenting solutions .    in section [ general ] ,",
    "we pose our problem and provide the general form of its solutions . in section [ solutions ] , we present examples of generic solutions and organize them according to their singularity structure in phase space . in section [ bvp ] , we present a few solutions of physically realistic boundary value problems . the literature on several related problems is briefly discussed in section [ discussion ] .",
    "the appendices include brief details on the symmetry properties of the phase space , and an alternate derivation and representation of a subset of our solutions that includes the classical catenaries .    throughout",
    ", we will use the following terms interchangeably : `` tension '' and `` stress '' , `` string '' and `` cable '' .",
    "we first consider catenary curves in three dimensions in section [ fullproblem ] , before casting and solving the problem in two - dimensional form in section [ planarproblem ] .",
    "additional three - dimensional aspects of the solution are reserved for section [ towing ] .",
    "consider a curve @xmath1 parameterized by arc length @xmath2 and time @xmath3 , carrying an adapted orthonormal frame @xmath4 whose spatial rotations are described by two extrinsic curvatures @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "hence , @xmath7 we seek solutions in the form of shapes translating with uniform velocity @xmath8 , with a uniform axial flow of material given by a tangential velocity @xmath9 .",
    "these velocities lead to linear , anisotropic drag forces with coefficients @xmath10 for drag along the tangent and @xmath11 for drag in the directions of either of the two normals @xmath12 or @xmath13 .",
    "a uniform body force @xmath14 acts on the string .",
    "these elements are shown schematically in figure [ curve3d ] .",
    "material time derivatives , taken at fixed @xmath2 , provide the velocity and acceleration for the assumed form of motion , @xmath15 allowing us to write a force balance on the string , @xmath16 the first term represents inertial forces ( per unit volume ) arising from centripetal accelerations of material moving along the rigidly translating shape .",
    "the mass coefficient @xmath17 represents both the material of the string as well as added mass effects from the surrounding fluid , while the body force @xmath14 could be linked to the density of the body , an electric field acting on a charged body , or any other uniform effects .",
    "the drag coefficients @xmath10 and @xmath11 are taken to be constant over the range of velocities experienced by the body , and are logarithmically singular in the filament radius ( normalized by some larger cutoff length ) .",
    "the derivation is similar to those found in @xcite , and breaks down if the curvatures get too large . ] .",
    "finally , @xmath18 is the tension in the string , which acts as a multiplier enforcing the inextensibility constraint @xmath19 .",

    "when the drag terms vanish , we recover the classical catenaries .",
    "if , in addition , the body force vanishes , any arbitrary configuration @xmath20 with uniform tension @xmath21 is a solution ; these are the routh `` lariats '' that snake along their own tangents @xcite .",
    "arbitrary configurations @xmath20 are also solutions when drag forces are present , but isotropic ( @xmath22 ) ; these sediment as rigid , tensionless bodies ( @xmath23 ) at a velocity such that @xmath24 .    as is true for many string problems , generic solutions of the equation of motion are planar , meaning that @xmath25 and @xmath13 is a constant vector . this may be seen by considering the projections onto the frame vectors , @xmath26 taking repeated @xmath2-derivatives of , remembering that @xmath8 and @xmath14 are constant vectors , and using the relations .",
    "one finds that the only fully three - dimensional solutions are the limiting cases already mentioned .",
    "additionally , equations ( [ tproj]-[nproj ] ) may be used to show that the only lariats ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) in the presence of tangential drag forces are straight lines ( @xmath29 ) .    before discussing generic planar solutions ,",
    "let us pause and consider these simplest of equilibria , straight lines , known to arise when a cable has one free end . for straight lines ,",
    "the @xmath30 terms in are zero , and the distinction between any vectors orthogonal to the tangent disappears .",
    "an equation like holds for any such vector , which implies that the straight cable lives in the plane spanned by any choice of nonvanishing , noncollinear velocity @xmath8 and body force @xmath14 .",
    "imagine towing a cable with one end on a reel and the other end free .",
    "given @xmath8 and @xmath14 , the angle of attack of the cable is determined , and relates the tension @xmath18 and the payout speed @xmath31 .",
    "the tension is a linear function of @xmath2 .",
    "if one end is free , the constant obtained by integrating is used to set the tension to zero there .",
    "the payout speed does not affect the angle of attack , but is linearly related to the tension at the tow point , and there is a particular speed at which an untensioned cable ( @xmath32 ) will be pulled off of the reel . for collinear @xmath8 and @xmath14 , parallel straight lines can move at any velocity , while for perpendicular straight lines there is a single velocity satisfying @xmath33 .",
    "either case admits any value of axial flow @xmath31 , although in the parallel case the distinction between @xmath8 and @xmath34 is ambiguous .",
    "similar calculations can be performed for nonlinear drag forces , when the geometry is linear like this .",
    "we may use the planarity of generic solutions to simplify their description .",
    "note that while the curves @xmath20 lie in a plane , this plane does not , in general , contain the body force or the direction of translation .",
    "specification of the plane requires use of the binormal force balance and an additional condition that will typically be provided by a boundary condition .",
    "we reserve discussion of this process until section [ towing ] , where we discuss a boundary value problem for towing a cable with specified endpoints . for",
    "now , we note that the specification of the binormal in accordance with these requirements leaves us to consider the balance of forces in the plane of the curve .",
    "this situation is illustrated in figure [ curve2d ] .",

    "we note , however , that the density of a massive cable acted on by gravity will indeed affect its geometry , through the body force parameter @xmath73 . specifying the horizontal and vertical velocity parameters @xmath74 and @xmath75 is akin to specifying the translational velocity magnitude @xmath58 and direction @xmath40 , and in the remainder of this paper we will use whichever description is simplest .",
    "the other quantities appearing are the axial flow parameter @xmath76 , the drag anisotropy @xmath77 , and a scaling constant @xmath78 which is inherited from the limiting case of the classical catenaries . due to the symmetry of the problem , we need only consider positive values of @xmath74 and @xmath73 .",
    "we will also restrict @xmath77 to the physically realistic range between zero ( purely normal drag ) and unity ( isotropic drag ) .",
    "the right hand side of equation is the product of an aperiodic exponential , a @xmath79-periodic function @xmath80 , and a @xmath0-periodic function @xmath81 .",

    "a generic phase portrait , drawn in the @xmath43-@xmath86 plane by varying the constant of integration @xmath78 , will consist of a series of lobes separated by fixed points and/or poles .",
    "it turns out that a single lobe , subtending an angle of @xmath0 , suffices to describe all the possible generic shape equilibria .",

    "details may be found in appendix [ zeroesandpoles ] .    while the full form of equation appears complicated ,",
    "there are many situations in which it can simplify .",

    "when displaying and comparing curves generated by different parameters , the scaling constant @xmath78 is not particularly interesting .",

    "we wish to compare several curves of equal length , while assuring display of a result corresponding to as much of the orbit as is possible .",
    "we achieve this by scaling solution curves such that a length of unity is associated with subtension of an angle slightly less than @xmath0 .",
    "this requires @xmath78 to vary along with the other parameters .",

    "this representation is an efficient means of displaying families of curves , but often does not correspond to the variation of conditions arising naturally in a realistic boundary value problem .",

    ", we can not integrate the full @xmath0 radians and obtain finite curves for display . likewise , integrating up to a curvature singularity is numerically impractical .",

    "the choice of cutoff affects the magnitudes of the curvature and stress , so care must be taken in comparing solutions with different values of @xmath94 .",
    "all of the curves in this section ( [ examples ] ) were generated with a cutoff @xmath98 .",
    "the normalization is achieved by using the fact that the length of the curve is @xmath99 so that a length of unity is achieved by setting @xmath100 first substituting the expression obtained from for the integrand on the right hand side . with this value of @xmath78",

    "a dotted line on the end of a curve indicates that the curve could be continued out to infinite length , while an open circle indicates that the curve terminates .",
    "of course , one can always cut a solution subtending an angle less than @xmath0 from any of these mother curves .",
    "figures [ curve90]-[curvem90 ] show catenaries rigidly moving at three different speeds in five different directions , with drag anisotropy taking the stokes flow value @xmath105 .",
    "these solutions are all heteroclinic connections corresponding to infinitely long configurations . not surprisingly , the alignment of the curves is set by competition between the body force @xmath36 and translational velocity @xmath106 .",
    "there are also subtle differences in the configurations generated by a uniform body force or anisotropic drag forces , best seen in figure [ curve90 ] where the two vectors are aligned .",
    "the orbits in figure [ curvem45 ] are significantly asymmetric , as is quite apparent from inspection of the configurations generated with a symmetric cutoff @xmath94 from an infinitely long mother curve .",
    "when looking at these figures , it is important to recall that the solutions are generated by constraining the curves to be of unit length while subtending an angle just shy of @xmath0 radians .",
    "this is not equivalent to fixing the location of the curve ends and varying the velocity .",
    "the latter more realistic boundary value problem will be addressed in section [ bvp ] .",
    "the tension in all of these curves increases indefinitely as the curves go off to infinity in either direction .",
    "it is intuitively plausible that holding or towing an infinitely long curve should require infinite force , but in section [ organization ] we will show that this is not always the case .    in figure",
    "[ curvem90 ] , the curves flip from being concave up to concave down . when @xmath107 , our scaling is pathological and the solutions are straight lines perpendicular to @xmath35 and @xmath39 .",
    "however , this is not the full story .",
    "the transition to concave down curves is not smooth . for a small window of parameters such that the velocity and body force are nearly balanced , we encounter double - sided blowup solutions corresponding to finite - length curves , as in figure [ sedimentm90 ] .",
    "the tension profile now peaks in the middle and , for these rigidly moving curves , goes to zero at the ends .",
    "thus , these parachute - like objects are solutions to a free sedimentation problem for perfectly flexible filaments .",

    "arrows indicate the direction of flow .",
    "the biggest contribution to the variation in tension with axial flow @xmath31 is a centripetal shift of @xmath104 .",

    "one should imagine two reels traveling downward and exchanging a length of cable between them .",
    "the tension at the ends is now @xmath104 rather than zero .    with sufficiently large axial flow , the solutions become of single - sided blowup type , corresponding to semi - infinite length curves .",
    "figure [ semim90 t ] shows an example , with drag anisotropy @xmath108 . here",
    "the tension is @xmath104 on the finite end of the body , and goes to infinity on the infinite side .",
    "as will be discussed in section [ organization ] , this is not always how the tension behaves in such curves .",
    "the transitions between these qualitatively different configurations are controlled by the signs and relative magnitudes of the exponents of @xmath84 and @xmath85 in equation .",
    "these exponents are the twice - rescaled axial flow @xmath76 and the quantity @xmath109 defined in .",
    "inequalities that govern the shapes are @xmath110 the corresponding equalities are special cases that will be discussed below .",
    "there are also transitions in the behavior of the tension at the zeroes or poles .",

    "these results seem strange .",
    "we would naively expect the dashed lines to coincide with the colored borders , so that the tension behavior echoed the shape of the curves .",
    "a more physically intuitive map may be drawn using the once - rescaled quantities .",

    "due to the symmetry of the problem , we need only consider one octant of the sphere .",

    "those in the teal heteroclinic regions that include the @xmath112 and @xmath113 corners have infinite tension on both ends , while those in the region that entirely encloses the orange double - sided blowup region have finite tension on both ends . moving along a lattitude line keeps the axial flow fixed while varying the relative strengths of the translational drag forces and body force .",
    "moving along a meridian keeps the ratio of drag to body forces fixed while varying the axial flow .",

    "hence , inferences about even weakly stiff filaments from results in our singular limit may not be well advised . on the other hand , for an elastic rod",
    "as opposed to a macromolecule with elastic properties that could be more exotic than those of a simple rod at low reynolds number , nonlocal hydrodynamic forces will dominate over bending .",
    "these next - order interactions are likely responsible for much of the nonlinear phenomena observed in the literature .",
    "they are also likely to destabilize many , if not all , of the sedimentation solutions found in the present study .",
    "all this aside , the nature of the transition from steady to periodic to presumably aperiodic sedimentation with decreasing bending stiffness is a topic worthy of further investigation .",
    "extending the towing results of section [ towing ] to steady rotations and the signed quadratic drag forces reflective of high reynolds number would aid in understanding towed cable and drogue dynamics in the air or ocean . in the context of single - end towing problems ,",
    "much attention has been paid to linear and circular maneuvers , as well as combinations of these basic elements to form hairpin turns @xcite .",
    "equilibrium shapes and tensions are of interest , as are small vibrations superimposed on these background solutions .",
    "pode captured the salient features of the planar rigid towing problem in terms of four quadratures @xcite . building on this work ,",
    "eames @xcite provided analytical expressions for the cartesian position vector of a cable towing a heavy drogue and translating perpendicularly to the body force , for several different drag assumptions including isotropic linear drag .",
    "he also discusses other interesting boundary value problems . while the non - analyticity of signed quadratic drag is inconvenient",
    ", it is a surmountable difficulty , and it appears upon preliminary glance that these equilibria can be reduced to either first- or second - order dynamical systems .",
    "such representations would be of lower order than the systems of equations in some of the preceding references , and of considerable advantage , in the search for equilibria , over the full - blown numerical schemes in the others .    in the limiting case of reeling discussed in section [ reeling ] ,",
    "any nonlinear relationship between velocity and drag force can be accommodated in a shape equation much like .",
    "human - scale experiments using chains or ropes in a `` lariat chain '' configuration @xcite , for which we expect the drag to be quadratic in form , should afford a test of the theory .",
    "another theoretical study of this configuration may be found in an early paper by gregory @xcite , whose results are consistent with our shape bifurcation from heteroclinic to single - end blowup when drag forces become sufficiently large .",
    "it should also be possible to experimentally search for configurations corresponding to transitions between solution types . at a particular speed",
    ", the cable should be able to subtend an angle greater than @xmath0 , though for a given length the stability , and therefore the observability , of this solution will depend on the weight of the material .",
    "the existence of such a solution only under such restrictive conditions on speed is surprising , and this result will remain suspect until it is observed experimentally .",
    "the problem of laying and recovery of cable is a hybrid of towing and reeling problems , with a history that begins with the work of thomson @xcite and airy @xcite in the mid-19th century , and continues into the modern day @xcite .",
    "thomson neglected drag forces , while airy unrealistically assumed the forces to be linear and isotropic , corresponding to our limit @xmath136 .",
    "the mid-20th century work of zajac @xcite is particularly worthy of note in the light of the present study in that , with particular assumptions on the configurations and boundary conditions , he considered the two - dimensional translation problem with axial flow and quadratic drag as a pair of coupled first order ordinary differential equations akin to our equations and .",
    "extension of this work to non - uniform high reynolds number flows , and the non - planar shapes they can induce , is relevant to sonar , cable laying , mooring lines , and newer applications such as tethered wind energy devices @xcite .",
    "it may also have some biological relevance .",
    "the deformation of plant life in response to non - uniform winds and waves , euphemized as `` reconfiguration '' by vogel @xcite , is a topic attracting much recent activity in the form of experimental and modeling studies of living and inanimate blade - like planar structures @xcite .",
    "possible complications here include bending resistance , and non - uniform buoyancy due to variation in morphology or health along the blade @xcite . in some of these , as well as other , high - reynolds number systems",
    ", it may be reasonable and analytically helpful to neglect tangential drag forces .    from a more fundamental point of view",
    ", the question of rotating , axially flowing equilibria subjected to linear drag forces would provide a simple framework to study the interaction between gyroscopic and dissipative mechanisms for breaking the axial flow symmetry of a one - dimensional continuum living in three dimensions .",
    "we have presented and organized a six - parameter family of solutions , containing a five - parameter family of shapes , that extend the classical problem of the catenary to include linear drag forces resulting from translation and axial motion .",
    "the shapes are described by a first - order dynamical system .",
    "limiting cases include sedimentation , towing , and reeling of cables .",
    "the effects of variation of parameters on solutions were displayed , first in a comprehensive but abstract way , and then with reference to a few specific problems with physically realistic boundary conditions and an integral constraint on length .",
    "these solutions may serve as a starting point for more advanced studies of flexible structure equilibria in fluid flows .",

    "the projections ( [ tproj]-[bproj ] ) of the dimensionful three - dimensional problem onto the frame vectors are modified accordingly , @xmath197 we may note immediately that combining and an @xmath2-derivative of leads to the equation @xmath198 , implying that any solutions with nontrivial stress @xmath18 and curvature @xmath30 must be planar ( @xmath199 ) . therefore , we restrict consideration to the planar problem obtained by projecting the rigid form of the dimensionless equation onto @xmath42 and @xmath12 .",
