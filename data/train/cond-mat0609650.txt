    "understanding how materials fracture is a fundamental problem of science and engineering even today , although the effects of geometry , loading conditions , and material characteristics on the strength of materials have been empirically investigated from antique times .",
    "probably the first systematic mathematical analysis of the problem dates back to the pioneering works of leonardo da vinci @xcite and galileo galilei @xcite . in leonardo",
    "s notebooks one finds an interesting description of a tension test on metal wires @xcite . attaching a slowly filling sand bag to an end of the wire , leonardo noticed that longer wires failed earlier ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : leo ] ) . a simple analysis based on",
    "continuum mechanics , however , would suggest that wires of the same section should carry the same stress and hence display equal strength .",
    "this lead some later commentators to hypothesize that when leonardo wrote _ smaller length _ , what he really meant was _ larger diameter _ @xcite . as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , there is a simpler explanation : continuum mechanics treats the material as homogeneous , but this is often very far from the truth , especially for metal wires forged in the renaissance .",
    "disorder has profound effects on material strength , since fracture typically nucleates from weaker spots like preexisting microcracks or voids .",
    "the longer the wire , the easier it is to find a weak spot , hence the strength will decrease with length .",
    "what we have just described is probably the first experimental verification of size effect in fracture .",
    "size effects are rooted in disorder and hence necessitates a statistical treatment .",
    "in particular , different samples of the same material could generally be expected to display fluctuations in the strength .",
    "the importance of defects and fluctuations in fracture was first realized in the early twenties by the work of griffith @xcite and later formalized from the statistical point of view by weibull @xcite .",
    "an excellent discussion of the history of strength up to the middle of the twentieth century can be found in the book by timoshenko @xcite . at present",
    "the importance of a statistical treatment in determining the strength of materials is certainly widely accepted , but despite this fact standard textbooks on fracture mechanics devote little attention to this problem .",
    "in addition experimental evaluations of strength distribution and other statistical properties are relatively scarce in the literature .",
    "besides the engineering aspects of the problem , in the last twenty years the statistical properties of fracture have attracted a wide interest in the statistical physics community @xcite . in this context , fracture can be seen as the outcome of the irreversible dynamics of a long - range interacting , disordered system .",
    "several experimental observations have revealed that fracture is a complex phenomenon , described by scale invariant laws @xcite .",
    "examples notably include the acoustic emission measured prior to fracture and the roughness of the fracture surface .",
    "the observation of scaling makes it attractive to discuss breakdown processes in terms of statistical mechanics and in particular to search for analogies with phase transitions and critical phenomena .",
    "these give rise to probability distributions that bear resemblance with the empirical observations on fracture , in particular `` power - law '' ones .",
    "the statistical physics approach to fracture is often based on numerical simulation of lattice models , which allow for a relatively simple description of disorder and elasticity . the elastic medium is represented by a network of springs or beams .",
    "the disorder is modeled for instance by imposing random failure thresholds on the springs or by removing a fraction of the links . in this way the model retains the long range nature and the tensorial structure of the interactions .",
    "the local displacements can then be found by standard method for solving coupled linear equations .",
    "the lattice is loaded imposing appropriate boundary conditions and the fracture process can be followed step by step , in a series of quasi - equilibria .",
    "the cornerstone in this respect has been for the last twenty years the random fuse network ( or model , rfm ) @xcite , a lattice model of the fracture of solid materials in which as a further key simplification vectorial elasticity has been substituted with a scalar field .",
    "as damage accumulates , one observes intriguing _ history effects _ : in brittle failure , microcracks grow via the failure of the weakest elements @xcite . in ductile fracture , dislocations or plastic deformation accumulates , and in viscoelastic materials there is a variety of complex relaxation mechanisms of stress in addition to irreversible failure . meanwhile , the stress field evolves and develops a more and more inhomogeneous structure .",
    "this arises in the simplest case from microcrack interactions that can shield each other or act jointly to enhance the local stress at various points in the material .",
    "in addition to numerical simulations , lattice models are useful to obtain new theoretical ideas and approaches to the problem .",
    "the aim is to develop a probabilistic description of fracture involving the interplay between `` frozen '' properties , such as microcracks , and `` thermal '' noise .",
    "the former is independent of time , quenched into a sample and is only affected by whatever external influences the sample is subjected to and their internal consequences ( consider growing microcracks ) .",
    "the thermal noise comes from environmental effects and the coarse - grained fluctuations at the atomistic level . in this respect",
    ", so - called fiber bundle models represent a useful idealization and the basis for more complex theoretical developments @xcite .",
    "the exactly solvable global load sharing model can be seen as a mean - field version of the rfm .",
    "as it is customary with phase transitions and critical phenomena , mean - field theory provides a qualitative picture of the transition . in general , however , for elastic , brittle failure the critical stress is ruled by the behavior of the extremal values of the stress distribution , the highest stress(es ) present in any sample .",
    "this means that the highest moments of the distribution are crucial , contrary to what happens for other macroscopic properties such as the elastic moduli , which depend only on average mean - field quantities .",
    "one should be aware of this problem when trying to extend the results of fiber bundle models to more realistic cases .    at a more application - oriented level ,",
    "network models provide a valid alternative to standard finite element calculations , especially in cases where structural disorder and inhomogeneities are particularly strong @xcite .",
    "for instance , models of this kind are extensively used to model concrete @xcite .",
    "this approach can be relevant for the predictability of structural failure , the design of stronger materials and optimization of structural composition .",
    "the scope of this review is to present an introduction to statistical models of fracture . at the same time",
    ", the goal is to provide an overview of the current understanding gained with this approach .",
    "after at least twenty years of intense research in the subject , we feel the need for a summarizing work , complementing the early insight gained in the past with more reliable results obtained by large scale simulations , which became possible due to recent advances in computer power and novel computational algorithmic techniques .",
    "this allows to clarify some controversial issues , such as the scaling in the damage dynamics , the avalanches or bursts of microfailures , and the scaling of the fracture surface in lattice models .",
    "the access to better data and experimental progress has also created new unsolved problems .",
    "this work gives us thus an opportunity to outline both experimental and theoretical prospects .",
    "a research path that will not be pursued here is that of dielectric breakdown @xcite , which has many parallels with the rfm and the role of disorder is likewise important ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the review is organized as follows : a brief introduction to elasticity and fracture mechanics is reported in sec .",
    "[ sec : frac - mec ] .",
    "while this does not represent by any means an exhaustive account of this very extended field , it has the primary purpose to set the formalism and the basic notation to be used in the following . in sec .",
    "[ sec : exp ] we discuss the experimental background that motivates the introduction of statistical models of fracture .",

    "an appendix includes a description of the main numerical algorithms .",
    "fracture mechanics describes the formation and propagation of cracks in terms of macroscopic field equations , starting from the theory of linear elasticity .",
    "it is not our aim to review here the broad field of linear elastic fracture mechanics ( lefm ) .",
    "we provide only a short summary of the main concepts defining the basic terminology to be used in the following sections .",
    "in addition , we present a general discussion of the role of disorder in fracture .",
    "the theory of linear elasticity describes the small deformations of solid bodies under the action of external forces . consider a solid at rest and parameterize it by a set of coordinates @xmath0 .",
    "assuming that there is a direct relation between the coordinates @xmath1 of the deformed solid with those of the undeformed solid , we define the displacement field as @xmath2 .",
    "it is then convenient to introduce the the symmetric _",
    "strain tensor _ as @xmath3    when a solid deforms under the action of external forces , interactions at the molecular scale provide restoring forces that tend to bring the solid back to its reference configuration .",
    "each of the material particles of the solid is in equilibrium under the action of both internal force interactions and external applied forces .",
    "since all the internal forces should cancel each other due the action - reaction principle , when the equilibrium of a volume element @xmath4 is considered , we are left only with surface tractions that act on the surface @xmath5 that contains the volume element @xmath4 and externally applied body forces ( such as gravity ) that act over the volume element @xmath4 . in other words ,",
    "the only non - vanishing contribution to the force should come from the tractions applied at the surface @xmath5 and the external body forces that act over volume @xmath4 . thus the external force vector @xmath6 with components @xmath7 is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the components of body forces per unit volume , and @xmath10 are the components of the surface tractions ( force per unit surface area ) . by notation , the bold symbols refer to vector or tensor quantities . based on cauchy s hypothesis ,",
    "the surface tractions are given by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the unit outward normal to the surface @xmath5 and @xmath13 is the cauchy stress tensor with components @xmath14 . using the divergence theorem , eq . [ forces ] can be written as @xmath15 dv$ ] ( where @xmath16 is the gradient operator ) , and in component form as @xmath17 the equilibrium condition for the body implies @xmath18 , which in terms of the stress tensor can be written as @xmath19 when the body forces @xmath20 are absent , eq .",
    "[ eq : stress_eq1 ] reduces to @xmath21    in the limit of small deformations , there is a linear relation between stress and strain @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the elastic moduli tensor .",
    "( [ eq : hooke0 ] ) is the most general linear expression relating the strain and the stress tensor , but it becomes much simpler in the case of isotropic media : @xmath24 where the parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 are known as lam coefficients , and @xmath27 when @xmath28 and is @xmath29 otherwise .",
    "it is often convenient to write the strain tensor as the sum of a compressive strain , involving a volume change , and a shear strain , which does not imply any volume changes .",
    "then the hooke laws can be written as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the bulk modulus and @xmath26 is the shear modulus .",
    "finally , another standard formulation of the hooke law involves the young modulus @xmath32 and the poisson ratio @xmath33 @xmath34 the equation for stress equilibrium for an isotropic elastic medium can be written , combining the hooke law with eq .",
    "( [ eq : stress_eq ] ) , in terms of the displacement field @xmath35 the lam coefficients @xmath25 and @xmath26 as @xmath36 with appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "note that we have used both @xmath37 notation and the bold face notation interchangeably to denote a vector quantity .      in mathematical terms",
    ", a crack can be seen as a boundary condition for the elastic strain field , with the additional complication that the precise shape of the crack is in principle unknown , and the shape depends on the stress field acting on it . to overcome this formidable problem , one can prescribe the crack geometry and then compute the stress field .",
    "this approximation can provide a useful guidance on the mechanism of crack propagation .",
    "a simple illustrative example of this procedure is provided by the solution of the stress field around an elliptic crack placed under tensile stress in an infinite two dimensional medium ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : elliptic ] ) .",
    "the solution of the elastic equation of equilibrium yields for instance the stress concentration at the edge of the ellipse @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the nominal applied stress and @xmath40 is the maximum stress , and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are major and minor radii of the ellipse . in reality cracks are not elliptical but typically display a sharp tip .",
    "if we rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq : kt ] ) in terms of the curvature radius @xmath43 , we see that @xmath44 diverges as @xmath45 as @xmath46 , and hence the concept of stress concentration becomes useless .",
    "it was first shown by irwin that the stress around a crack tip follows @xmath47 where @xmath44 is the _ stress intensity factor _ and",
    "@xmath48 is a crack - tip function in terms of the angular variables @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the particular values of @xmath44 and the functional forms of @xmath48 depend on the particular loading conditions ( i.e. the way stress is applied to the body ) . in this respect , it is convenient to identify three fracture modes ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : modes ] ) corresponding to tensile ( i ) , shear ( ii ) and tearing ( iii ) conditions ( i.e. , @xmath44 equals @xmath51 in mode i , @xmath52 in mode ii , and @xmath53 in mode iii ) . a generic loading rule can typically be split into an appropriate combination of the three modes .",
    "the presence of singularity around the crack tip , however , is an artifact of linear elasticity .",
    "real materials can not sustain arbitrarily large stresses and in general close to the crack tip deformation is ruled by non - linear and inelastic effects . in practice it is customary to define a fracture process zone ( fpz ) as the region surrounding the crack where these effects take place , while far enough from the crack one recovers linear elastic behavior , that is the long - range decay of perturbed displacement fields .    knowing the stress field around a crack",
    "does not tell us directly how the fracture process would develop , but this information is necessary to build a model .",
    "a simple and clear argument to understand the stability of a crack was provided by griffith almost a century ago @xcite .",
    "the idea is to compute the energy needed to open a crack and see when this process becomes favorable . considering for simplicity a two dimensional geometry , the elastic energy change associated with a crack of length @xmath41",
    "is given by @xmath54 where @xmath39 is the applied stress .",
    "forming a crack involves the rupture of atomic bonds , a process that has an energy cost proportional to the crack surface @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the surface tension .",
    "griffith noted that a crack will grow when this process leads to a decrease of the total energy @xmath57 .",
    "thus the criterion for crack growth can be expressed as @xmath58 which implies that under a stress @xmath39 cracks of size @xmath59 are unstable .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : griffith ] ) can also be written as @xmath60 and , noting that @xmath61 is the stress intensity factor of an infinite plate , we can reformulate the crack growth criterion in terms of a critical stress intensity factor @xmath62 , also known as the material toughness ( i.e. the crack grows when @xmath63 ) .",
    "the influence of randomness on fracture can have many disguises .",
    "it is useful to leave aside inelastic effects for awhile , and consider only brittle or `` quasi - brittle '' processes . in this case",
    ", we can generalize the discussion of section  [ sec : elastic_cracks ] , using the concepts of long - range elastic fields , critical energy or crack size .",
    "there are several independent subcases that present different physics : one may consider a single crack and analyze the effect of disorder on material strength or , alternatively , one could study the dynamics of a whole crack population .",
    "in general , we can identify some key issues to address :    1 .",
    "what is the effect of disorder on the stability of a single crack , and how does the griffith argument get modified ?",
    "2 .   in the presence of many cracks ,",
    "how is the physics changed from the case of a single crack ?",
    "what is the effect of disorder on the propagation of a single crack ? 4 .",
    "what are the concepts , and statistical laws that operate in the case of many cracks of which no single one dominates over the others ?    these four fundamental questions also touch upon a number of engineering mechanics and materials science issues , such as fracture toughness , crack arrest , defect populations , damage mechanics , and failure prediction .",
    "the first two issues from the above list deal with _ size scaling _ and the statistics of strength .",
    "figure  [ fig:1ddemo ] illustrates the schematic advancement of a two - dimensional crack from a pre - existing flaw ( or a notch in a test ) .",
    "the presence of variation in the material structure can be presented ideally - in brittle materials - by locally varying elastic moduli , so that the stress - field becomes more complicated than the homogeneous lefm solution .",
    "it can also be seen as a crack surface energy @xmath64 which has a fluctuating component .",
    "the issue of size effects amounts to computing the strength of a sample of linear size @xmath65 .",
    "the answer of course depends on whether the sample has one dominating crack or more number of microcracks or flaws .    in the case of a single dominating defect",
    ", the griffith argument can be easily modified to account for a spatial variation of the elastic coefficients .",
    "the technical problem is to consider the distributions of the surface energy @xmath66 and elastic modulus @xmath67 , or , even the presence of dislocations in the sample . as a result",
    ", one gets instead of the deterministic critical crack length ( for constant @xmath67 and @xmath66 ) a probability for the crack to be stable under a given external stress . in other words",
    ", we can characterize the problem by a _ strength distribution _ which in the case of a single crack crucially depends on the microscopic randomness .",
    "for instance , arndt and nattermann @xcite showed that an uncorrelated random @xmath66 results in an exponential strength distribution .",
    "in general , however , @xmath66 could also display spatial correlations , as measured by the two point correlator @xmath68 , where the brackets denote a statistical average .",
    "correlations in @xmath66 imply that an increased crack opening will cost energy that not only depends on @xmath66 at a single location but also depends on the presence of such correlations .",
    "in the presence of many non - interacting defects , it becomes apparent that the physics is related to _ extreme statistics _ ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cloud ] ) .",
    "the simplest starting point is to find the largest defect - or the most dangerous one - in the system .",
    "later on in the context of random fuse networks we will return to this argument in more detail .",
    "if the critical crack fails instantaneously , there is no pre - critical crack growth , and the cracks do not interact , then this is a sufficient condition for determining the statistical strength properties .",
    "in other words , we want to consider a dilute gas of non - interacting defects , and find the worst one using a lifshitz type argument @xcite .",
    "consider a collection of @xmath69 defects , and assign to each of these a failure strength @xmath70 , where @xmath71 .",
    "the whole sample fails if one of these defects can not stand the applied stress .",
    "thus for the cumulative strength distribution @xmath72 one has that @xmath73.\\ ] ] if the cracks are independent so that @xmath70 are random variables distributed according to @xmath74 , then it follows that @xmath75\\ ] ] where @xmath76 is the crack density and @xmath77 the sample volume .",
    "the crucial ingredients here are the @xmath78 and @xmath69 since they rule both the asymptotic form of the distribution @xmath79 as well as its form for finite @xmath69 .",
    "of these two issues , more interesting is the behavior of @xmath80 in the large @xmath69 limit .",
    "then , the question boils down to the actual distribution of the @xmath78 . for narrow distributions ,",
    "one has the _ gumbel _ scaling form @xmath81 } \\label{gumbel}\\ ] ] where the function @xmath82 follows from @xmath78 and depends on two things : the stress enhancement factor of a typical defect of linear size @xmath83 , and the size distribution @xmath84 of the defects .",
    "for example , an exponential @xmath84 will thus result in this _ gumbel _ scaling form .",
    "the other possibility is to use a distribution @xmath84 that makes the local stresses at crack tips to have a wide distribution as well . using a length distribution @xmath85 changes the limiting distribution of the sample strength to a weibull distribution .",
    "the reason is simple : assuming that the stress @xmath39 at the crack tips grows as a power of crack length @xmath83 , then the @xmath78 also becomes a power law distribution since @xmath84 is a power law distribution . as a result ,",
    "the celebrated weibull distribution @xcite ( or its 3-parameter version ) arises : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is a normalization constant , and @xmath88 is the weibull modulus , which can be related to the strength of a defect of size @xmath83 .",
    "in particular , we have that if @xmath89 then @xmath90 .",
    "as usual , a small @xmath88 implies a heterogeneous material / sample as @xmath91 is then small as well . in any case , the distributions eqs .",
    "( [ gumbel ] ) , ( [ weibull ] ) allow now to distinguish between microscopic details in experiments , and predict the size - scaling of average strength .",
    "the gumbel - form is apt to give a logarithmic size - effect , but note that this is only true in the absence of notches or dominating defects ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : notch ] ) .",
    "are assumed in the simplest case to have no influence on each other , and they have a linear size distribution @xmath84.,width=377 ]      the discourse on strength changes character if one allows for slow _ average _ crack growth .",
    "here , we would like to focus on the case in which the fracture dynamics is continuous and slow , so that in spite of possibly very fast local developments , a sample can be considered in a quasi - equilibrium .",
    "this means that the sample internal state is either independent of time or evolves slowly with respect to the fast time - scale of the fracture process . even in these conditions , treating explicitly the dynamics of interacting microcracks represents a formidable task : the growth of a microcrack can be either inhibited / screened or accelerated due to the presence of a neighboring microcrack .",
    "the outcome in general depends on the loading conditions , the crack geometry and other details , as discussed in the engineering mechanics literature .    to avoid all these complications",
    ", one can disregard the dynamics of individual microcracks and treat the damage at a coarse grained scale .",
    "this approach , known as `` damage mechanics '' @xcite , is valid when the interaction among cracks is moderate . in the simplest case",
    ", one can consider the evolution of a scalar valued damage field @xmath92 , describing the local variations of the hooke law @xmath93 the idea behind damage mechanics is that all the complications of the fracture process can be encoded in the field @xmath94 , that will then evolve according to a prescribed law , reflecting the internal microcracking in the material .",
    "simple models of statistical fracture can be used to check some of the typical assumptions and possible outcomes in damage mechanics .",
    "this is in particular applicable in `` scalar fracture '' , described by the electrical analogue of the rfm . in order to apply the coarse - graining procedure , implied by eq .",
    "( [ damage ] ) , one assumes the presence of a length - scale over which the damage self - averages , meaning that its fluctuations become much smaller than the average .",
    "this scale is also known as the representative volume element ( rve ) above which it is possible to treat the damage as a smoothly varying variable .",
    "figure [ fig : cloud ] depicts the typical scenario for damage accumulation . in this example",
    "we imagine a set of microcracks that will grow in a stable manner , and give rise to locally enhanced `` damage '' @xmath92 .",
    "one may now naturally define a _ correlation length _",
    ", by measuring e.g. the two - point correlation function of a scalar @xmath94 via @xmath95 which should decay , for a field @xmath94 which is uncorrelated over longer distances , asymptotically exponentially and thus defines a correlation length @xmath96 via @xmath97 .",
    "an interesting issue is the `` symmetry breaking '' in damage accumulation : the direction of crack growth is mostly dictated by geometry and loading conditions .",
    "thus , as illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : cloud ] , it is necessary to consider separately the directions perpendicular and parallel to the external stress , which would then imply _ two correlation lengths _ , @xmath98 and @xmath99 .    given a fracture process , in which damage grows in a controlled fashion one can then - in principle , at least in simulations - follow the development of @xmath96 .",
    "this quantity will increase , making a sample effectively `` smaller '' : as @xmath96 ( and the rve size ) increases @xmath100 diminishes , where @xmath65 is as usual the sample linear size .",
    "an additional complication comes from the damage anisotropy , since the two correlation lengths @xmath99 and @xmath98 will follow different dynamics .    it is interesting to discuss what happens when one of the two becomes much larger than the other . in this case",
    "the sample becomes effectively much `` larger '' along the stress direction , becoming almost one - dimensional , which in other words indicates the presence of _ damage localization_. the developments that lead to and beyond this point are of course an interesting issue , with also materials science twists .",
    "consider for instance the mechanics of fiber - reinforced composites : eventually one crack will dominate , but still the specimen may have a finite strength remaining thanks to fibers that bridge the crack and induce cohesion .    in general",
    ", it is a complicated question as to what kind of evolution would rule @xmath101 , even if the possibly very important role of fluctuations is neglected .",
    "that is , as the @xmath96 increases the damage inside the corresponding rve should fluctuate more and more .",
    "recall also the connection between @xmath94 and the sample effective elastic modulus , which implies that the two follow similar dynamics .",
    "one can postulate several possible scenarios for the damage dynamics , including so - called `` finite - time singularities '' ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these imply a divergence of the strain under a linearly growing applied stress @xmath102 @xmath103 i.e. a power - law -like or pseudo - critical approach to the failure time @xmath104 and to the corresponding critical stress @xmath105 . in the context of damage mechanics , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ftimes ] ) would result from a stress dependent damage law of the type @xmath106 . in cases with a dominant crack this law",
    "can be related to the crack growth rate as a function of @xmath39 .",
    "another possibility is that the damage displays an abrupt jump at @xmath107 .",
    "the two possibilities are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : damagelaw ] .",
    "the statistical laws and geometry of damage accumulation can be studied both via laboratory experiments and the models that are the main scope of this review , and they often have also great importance for engineering applications . the typical engineering mechanics viewpoint of the previous discussion is to look at the rate of crack growth given just a single crack .",
    "the assumption is that the crack length @xmath41 evolves according to @xmath108 where @xmath109 is an effective stress intensity factor and the exponent @xmath88 typically varies between @xmath110 and @xmath111 @xcite .",

    "[ fig : damagelaw ]        while damage mechanics treats fracture in disordered media at a coarse grained scale , it is often necessary to treat the dynamics of a single macroscopic crack .",
    "a simple example is to consider a medium containing regions with sufficiently high @xmath66 , locally , so as to stop crack growth . in these circumstances",
    "energetic considerations dictate that the crack path will deviate from the straight direction ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1ddemo ] ) .",
    "the simple case is the two - dimensional one , when the vertical coordinate of the crack tip , @xmath114 , ( where @xmath115 is the position along the horizontal projection of the crack path ) wanders with equal probability up and down .",
    "this process corresponds directly to a random walk or brownian motion .",
    "this fact implies that the crack surface , corresponding to the trajectory of the crack tip , displays a characteristic _ roughness_. in the following we consider the fracture surfaces @xmath116 in various cases .",

    "in reality , one should keep in mind that due to the presence of long range elastic fields , the dynamics of the crack tip is never a simple uncorrelated random walk in 2d . the interplay between elasticity and disorder",

    "anomalous scaling usually implies that the roughness of a self - affine object ( e.g. a crack ) develops a power - law dependence on the system size @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "one should thus define two different exponents @xmath142 and @xmath175 : the first exponent describing the dependence of the global roughness on the system size , while the second encodes the scaling of the local roughness on the measuring window .",

    "an interesting issue here is how ordinary lefm changes in the presence of a crack with a `` rough '' or self - affine geometry .",
    "the same problem can also be restated in the presence of general damage or a population of self - affine microcracks .",
    "all in all , there are at least three different possibilities .",
    "one can consider the stress - field in the proximity of a `` fractal crack '' , but then one has to remember that nature does not create a priori such objects - they grow because of some stable crack growth process .",

    "a particular version is to consider the lam equation , eq .",
    "( [ lame ] ) , in the presence of a given self - affine boundary . this can be solved in some cases to illuminate possible changes from lefm , but is of course outside of fracture .",

    "this allows to grow relatively large cracks iteratively , accounting for a stochastic `` annealed '' growth probability on the crack perimeter .",
    "the reasons why the roughening of cracks is interesting are multiple .",

    "second , it has also an engineering implication . consider a crack which `` starts flat '' and then undergoes a process which indicates a scaling behavior similar to eq .",
    "( [ fv ] ) .",
    "an infinitesimal crack opening will now cost _ more surface energy _ than in the usual case , and thus the griffith argument ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : griffith ] ) ) is modified in a way that accounts for the roughness exponent @xmath142 , the maximal extent of fluctuations @xmath181 , and possibly also the modified elastic energy due to the rough crack . in the case of anomalous scaling",
    "( see eq .",
    "( [ scaleform ] ) again ) , the extra scale also would enter the argument , further changing the amount of surface energy needed for infinitesimal crack advancement .",
    "this implies a non - trivial `` r - curve '' , or crack resistance , since the energy consumed via forming new crack surface depends not only on the full set of exponents but again on the distance propagated @xcite .",
    "an expression can be written down using solely geometric arguments and the exponents as given below : @xmath182 where @xmath183 is the distance to the initial notch @xmath119 .",
    "there are two different regimes : for @xmath184 , @xmath185 , and for @xmath186 , which is characterized by the exponent @xmath187 .",

    "many authors have argued for the presence of `` fractal '' effects in the energy consumption ( see e.g. @xcite ) , while it seems clear that the relevant framework for calculating the true surface energy ( @xmath66 ) for the energy balance in the griffith argument is a self - affine one @xcite ( here we neglect the complications of multiscaling or anomalous scaling for simplicity ) .",
    "this can be argued for simply since the experimental situation seems clear - cut : usually cracks are self - affine ( if not flat , but see also ref .",
    "the attraction of ( self - affine ) fractal scaling ideas here is that they allow to understand the energy consumption mechanism(s ) simply via an interpretation of the roughness exponent @xmath142 or the fractal dimension @xmath195 .",
    "the models to be discussed in later sections are a toolbox for testing the influence of disorder on strength , since these models lead to rough , self - affine cracks .",
    "if one allows for mesoscopic plasticity , one would still expect the same kind of problems , but further theoretical questions are expected .",
    "to give a reference point for the theoretical and numerical ideas discussed later , we next overview shortly some relevant experimental quantities , focusing on fracture properties for which disorder and stochasticity are crucial .",
    "when necessary we refer to the concepts presented in the introduction , or point forward to the theoretical state - of - the - art presented in later sections .",
    "we would like to emphasize rather generally that the statistical aspects of fracture processes - scaling , exponents , distributions - are not understood even in the sense of a synthesis of experiments , with the main exception of the roughness behavior .",
    "this is by force reflected in the discussion that follows .",
    "the first of the issues is strength , both in terms of its probability distributions and the scaling with sample size .",
    "as noted in the previous section , from the theory viewpoint , the statistics of strength depend crucially on the presence of disorder .",
    "next , we consider crack roughness , which has an application to the question of the origins of the fracture toughness . as pointed out already in sec .",
    "[ sec : rough - tough ] , this is due to at least two reasons .",
    "the energy consumption that takes place when a crack increases in size is due to the product of surface energy and the new area .",
    "both can be affected by disorder , as in the case of griffith - like energy arguments and in the idea of crack surface area increasing with scale for self - affine cracks . in the case of fracture strength",
    ", disorder can be easily reinterpreted as a `` flaw population '' , whereas for cracks that roughen , disorder plays the role of `` noise '' during crack dynamics .",
    "this noise can either be `` quenched '' , i.e. , exists in the sample from the beginning in many disguises , or be created dynamically via for instance void - formation .",
    "a very important topic from our point of view is represented by acoustic emission ( ae ) in fracture experiments , a nice example of _ crackling noise_. the released elastic energy in fracture is a revealing diagnostic for the temporal aspects of fracture processes , and is used in applications as a monitoring tool for damage assessment .",
    "in addition , it has been long since realized that the ae signal appears to be _ critical _ : the energy of ae events often exhibits a power - law -like probability distribution .",
    "in contrast to thermal imaging or displacement field analysis , ae is not limited to sample surfaces and is sensitive to even very minute events .",
    "the two fundamental questions that concern us are : i ) how to connect the ae behavior to the other fracture properties , and ii ) how to understand theoretically the ae statistics .    in the last part of this section , we briefly outline phenomena that exhibit time - dependent response , and often go beyond the scope of brittle fracture .",
    "this concerns the role of microscopic but collective effects on crack growth resistance ( `` r - curve '' ) due to plasticity , and slow fracture processes with history effects such as creep and fatigue failure .",
    "we mostly omit discussing the spatial aspects of plastic deformation such as shear bands that bear some similarity to damage localization and fracture development in brittle and quasi - brittle fracture .",
    "measuring the scale - dependent properties of strength is difficult mainly because of sample - to - sample fluctuations .",
    "in addition , samples have free surfaces , and though one often compensates by adjusting the test geometry for the resulting free boundary effects ( poisson contraction ) , materials often display surface defects , giving rise to additional disorder .",
    "we can thus expect that the strength distribution will be a superposition of cases where surface - induced defects lead to failure and cases where bulk defects rule the process .",
    "obviously , separating the two mechanisms can be difficult . in the classical approach , the sample strength and the size effect",
    "is measured with a prepared notch . to obtain reliable results",
    ", one should have access to a large enough range of sample sizes .",
    "[ fig : strdistrs ] presents experimental data from brittle ceramics , wherein the data are plotted according to different extremal statistics distributions @xcite . in this particular case , the gumbel form fits the data better than the weibull distribution @xcite .",
    "the latter is traditionally used in the engineering literature in the analysis of fracture statistics and size effects in strength @xcite .",
    "one should pay attention to the fact that a weibull scaling can be ascertained more reliably by tests with varying sample sizes .",
    "one should note ( see also sec .",
    "[ sec : extr_stat ] ) that there is a priori no reason why a material should fulfill the prerequisites of belonging to any of the classes following from extremal statistics , be it weibull or gumbel .",
    "various recent attempts to characterize the strength distribution in materials with intrinsic disorder such as paper @xcite , concrete @xcite and others @xcite illustrate clearly the inherent difficulties in interpreting the data .",
    "[ fig : concreteweibull ] demonstrates this for concrete samples with a 1:32 size range . in this particular case , in addition to the inherent disorder and randomness",
    ", one has to deal with systematic stress gradients present in these samples .",
    "this appears to be a generic problem that persists among various experimental studies ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in the engineering mechanics literature ,",
    "the scaling of strength with sample size is usually discussed with the aid of three - point bending or tensile tests , done on samples in which the ratio @xmath196 of notch size to sample size is constant . clearly , in the absence of any other effects , the square - root -like enhancement @xmath197 for the stress intensity factor will eventually win the competition over the disorder , so that the strength will decay as expected by an inverse square - root law : @xmath198 .",
    "for small enough @xmath199 the situation is , however , not so simple since the stress enhancement due to the notch competes with the disorder . in this respect ,",
    "[ fig : sizescal ] demonstrates an example of data from concrete , where one can observe clear deviation from the ideal behavior .    in the presence of disorder and/or plasticity",
    "the scaling with a constant aspect ratio may be complicated by one issue . using engineering mechanics language",
    ", the fracture process zone ( fpz ) size @xmath200 may not be constant as a function of @xmath199 and @xmath65 .",
    "thus the energy balance ( griffith s ) argument develops a size - dependence , which can be understood considering that the energy needed for crack growth changes with the volume of the fpz .",
    "such complications should depend on the details of the processes that make the fpz change size .",
    "there is an extensive literature on the connection of microscopic and mesoscopic mechanisms to the size - effect , analyzing the possible behaviors of @xmath200 for various materials .",
    "many of these exhibit `` strain - softening '' , but other processes as crack bridging by fibers or precipitates etc .",
    "are surprisingly general as well from composites to concrete @xcite .",
    "this kind of analysis often also takes into account the role of free surfaces , which modify the fpz geometry if the crack is close to a free surface . from our viewpoint",
    ", one should note that the presence of disorder can simply make small enough cracks irrelevant @xcite , masking the presence of such defects .",
    "simply put , the randomness can correspond to an effective flaw size @xmath201 , so that for @xmath202 a flaw is so small as to not change the general behavior .    in conclusion",
    ", the issue of fracture strength from the statistical physics viewpoint appears to still lack , to a large degree , physics - oriented experiments , which would help to connect scaling theories to reality .",

    "an excellent review by elisabeth bouchaud summarizes the major results up to 1998 @xcite . in general , one has two main issues : first , understanding the scaling , depending on the details such as spatial dimension , material characteristics and loading state . in the language of self - affine geometry , this implies determining experimentally the scaling exponents , such as the @xmath139 , @xmath118 , and @xmath142 of the simplest family - vicsek scaling . ultimately , a determination of the behavior in terms of the exponents and scaling functions would point out the right stochastic equation that governs the process , including the noise that is present .",
    "second , whatever the truth be about universality , one can search for the mechanisms that lead to the formation of rough interfaces , and try to understand the consequences of self - affine crack surfaces .",

    "@xcite ) .    the most used ( and most physically correct ) models in this respect are the so - called beam and bond - bending models .",

    "the modeling of this localization process using continuum finite elements is fraught with serious difficulties , both from mathematical and numerical points of view .",
    "mathematically , the onset of strain softening leads to ill - posedness of the rate boundary value problem of the continuum equations @xcite .",
    "in particular , the governing set of partial differential equations in the standard rate - independent continuum lose their ellipticity for quasi - static loading conditions , while hyperbolicity may be lost locally for dynamic conditions @xcite . in analytical solutions ,",

    "when the problem is modeled and discretized with finite elements , the localization concentrates in the volume of material capable of representing the set of measure zero , which is a one element in one - dimensional problems or a one element wide line in two - dimensional problems . from a numerical perspective , this ill - posedness manifests itself in severe mesh dependence of the finite element solution in terms of mesh size and alignment .",
    "hence , the problem of mesh dependency is not intrinsically numerical but stems from the change of the character of the underlying differential equations of the continuum description .    in order to allow for modeling of localization and strain softening in the continuum description ,",
    "approaches based on strain localization limiters are proposed .",
    "the essential idea is to change the character of the equations so that the region of localization does not generate to the set of measure zero but to the physical region that can be deduced from the experimental procedures . in the literature , several regularization techniques ( localization limiters ) based on spatial nonlocal continuum concepts @xcite , higher - order gradient theories @xcite , micro - polar or cosserat continuum descriptions @xcite , viscoplastic regularization methodologies @xcite , and the regularized discontinuous displacement approximations @xcite have been presented for capturing the localization phenomena .",
    "these approaches ensure that the numerical solutions remain meaningful in the sense that a finite width of the localization zone and finite energy dissipation are obtained even when the localization zone is fully developed .",
    "the above localization limiters ( regularization techniques ) can be classified as integral , differential and rate limiters .",
    "integral or non - local limiters are based on integral strain measures over a finite domain .",

    "these finite element formulations are based on enhanced assumed strain ( eas ) formulations @xcite , and the displacement jump across a crack is incorporated into a finite element as an incompatible mode in the strain field .",
    "recently , extended finite element methods ( xfem ) @xcite based on the partition of unity approach @xcite are also employed for simulating the fracture of quasi - brittle materials . although the xfem has similarities in the modeling of cracks using discontinuous displacement interpolations within the elements , the xfem is far superior to the discrete discontinuous displacements based finite element approach . to start with",

    "it is possible to enhance these discontinuous interpolations with a suitably chosen near crack - tip fields to achieve a superior coarse mesh accuracy in the simulations .",
    "representing the cracks using a signed distance function based on level set methodology facilitates the evolution of cracks and hence alleviates the necessity to use automatic remeshing techniques and explicit representation of cracks @xcite .    even with these vastly improved finite element methodologies and the recent trend in explicitly modeling the material disorder @xcite",
    ", fracture simulation of disordered quasi - brittle materials with many interacting microcracks , and long - range spatial crack correlations and stress fluctuations poses a daunting task for current finite element methodologies .",
    "in particular , when the macroscopic fracture is preceded by many competing and interacting microcracks , both mathematical and numerical issues arise in assessing which crack should propagate and by how much should it propagate @xcite . in this sense , the rigor and accuracy of these homogenized finite element models based on effective medium ( or mean - field ) continuum theories is limited to moderate damage levels , whereas those based on continuum fracture mechanics is limited to the regime where the behavior is dominated by a single ( or few ) dominating crack . currently , the most fundamental challenge is to bridge the gap between the discrete and continuum descriptions of brittle fracture .",
    "recent finite element studies @xcite that explicitly include the material disorder effects are very promising in this direction .        in reality , on scales that are supposed to be described by the quasi - static models introduced above , fracture processes may also be influenced by time - dependent details .",
    "a possibility that has been widely explored in the past is to move from a deterministic dynamics in a disordered system to a stochastic dynamics in an homogeneous system @xcite .",
    "time dependent randomness has been implemented in two different ways in the rfm : the failure probability can be chosen to be a function of the instantaneous fuse current , or a functional ( such as an integral ) that depends on the current history .",

    "it is remarkable that an analogous result was found in ref .",
    "@xcite for crack nucleation in a disordered medium .",
    "the idea that there is a relation between fracture and phase transitions has a long history .",
    "for instance , the griffith theory of fracture is very similar in spirit to the classical theory of nucleation in first order phase transitions . in bubble nucleation",
    ", a critical droplet will form when the loss in free energy due to the bulk forces exceeds the increase in the interfacial energy .",
    "similarly fracture occurs if the external stress prevails over the resistance at surface of the crack .",
    "further analogies come from the scaling behavior observed in fracture experiments , such as for the crack roughness and the acoustic emission distributions . in the following",
    "we provide a basic introduction to phase transitions and discuss its relation to fracture using lattice models as an illustration .",
    "phase transitions are characterized by changes in the internal symmetries of a material as external control parameters are varied .",
    "familiar examples are the melting of a crystal , or the ferromagnetic transition in a magnet . in the first example",
    ", we have an abrupt first - order phase transition , with latent heat , coexistence and no precursors , while the latter is a continuous second - order transition .",
    "notice that one can also observe a first or a second order transition in the very same system , depending on the external conditions , the typical example being the gas - liquid transition that is first order at low temperatures and pressures and becomes second order in a particular point of the pt diagram .    to be more quantitative , one typically distinguishes a phase by an order parameter whose value is related to the internal symmetries of the system . for instance , a ferromagnet acquires a non - zero magnetization when the spin rotational symmetry of the paramagnetic phase is broken .",
    "since the transition is continuous , the magnetization vanishes as the transition is approached .",
    "this is unlike first order transitions , where the order parameter is discontinuous across the transition .",
    "this case is typically associated also with metastability : when the transition point is reached , the system needs some time to cross into the new equilibrium state .",
    "it does so by nucleation : small regions of the new phase are formed , until they become large enough to transform the system completely in a rapid event . in second order transitions ,",
    "the buildup of the new phase instead occurs before the transition point is reached through the formation of larger and larger correlations that span the entire system exactly at the critical point .",
    "this process is encoded in scale invariance : thermodynamic quantities around the critical point are described by homogeneous scaling functions .    to be more concrete and set up the notation , we consider the example of a uniaxial ferromagnetic system .",
    "the control parameters , in this case , are the temperature @xmath330 , the magnetic field @xmath435 and the average magnetization @xmath309 , which is the order parameter of the system . at high temperatures ,",
    "fluctuations dominate and the magnetization is zero on an average . as the temperature is lowered , the local magnetization becomes more and more correlated until the critical point @xmath436 is reached .",
    "the correlation length @xmath96 then diverges as @xmath437 where @xmath438 is a critical exponent .",
    "the average susceptibility @xmath439 also diverges , indicating that the system is extremely prone to changes , and it does so as @xmath440 the order parameter @xmath309 becomes non - zero in the ferromagnetic phase and close to the critical point follows @xmath441 defining another critical exponent .",
    "the presence of a magnetic field destroys the transition , forcing a particular direction for the magnetization , and thus defines another scaling law at @xmath436 @xmath442 we have defined a certain number of critical exponents , which are however not all independent , as can be shown by a more detailed analysis . here",
    ", we do not want to go further into these details but just highlight the fact that second - order phase transitions are associated with scaling and a diverging correlation length @xmath96 .",
    "a ferromagnet can also be used to illustrate the idea of nucleation , which is at the core of first order transitions .",
    "imagine that the temperature is fixed below the critical point and we instead vary the field @xmath435 . when the field is suddenly increased from a negative to a positive value",
    "the magnetization should also change sign , but if the value of the positive field is not so strong then the state with negative magnetization is still metastable .",
    "thus small local changes of the magnetization will be reabsorbed , while large sudden changes will be less favorable for entropic reasons .",
    "the system will spend a considerable time in this metastable state before a large enough change occurs . to be more precise ,",
    "the free energy cost of a spherical droplet of size @xmath83 is the sum of two contributions : a bulk decrease due to the magnetic field and a surface energy increase : i.e. @xmath443 where @xmath444 is the surface energy .",
    "if @xmath445 the droplet is unstable and a further increase in droplet size would result in a decrease in its free energy .",
    "thus the nucleation time can be estimated as the time needed to form the first unstable droplet . the analogy with griffith theory is evident and one could thus associate crack growth with a first order transition from an elastic body to a fractured solid driven by stress .",
    "the difference between first and second order behavior becomes more nuanced when nucleation takes place close to a spinodal point , corresponding to the field at which the metastable state becomes unstable and thus the system is forced to reverse .",
    "strictly speaking , the spinodal point only exists in mean - field theory , but its signatures can be observed even when interaction is long - ranged . the theoretical description of homogeneous spinodal nucleation is based on the landau - ginzburg free energy of a spin system in the presence of an external magnetic field . when the temperature is below the critical value , the free energy has the typical two - well structure as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : doublewell ] . in the presence of an external magnetic field ,",
    "one of the wells is depressed with respect to the other , which represents therefore the metastable state .",
    "the system must cross a free energy barrier to relax into the stable phase .",
    "when the external field is increased , this nucleation barrier decreases , eventually vanishing at the spinodal .",
    "the approach to the spinodal is characterized by scaling laws , analogous to critical phenomena , but the reversal is discontinuous and the transition is first - order .",
    "the magnetization or the order parameter @xmath309 scales with the external field @xmath435 as @xmath446 where @xmath447 and @xmath448 are the values of the order parameter and the field at the spinodal .",
    "this law implies a divergence of the quasi - static susceptibility @xmath449 the fluctuations in the order parameter can be related to suitably defined droplets , whose sizes turn out to be power law distributed with an exponent @xmath450 . for finite - dimensional short - range models ,",
    "this mean - field picture is expected to fail , since the system will nucleate before reaching the spinodal point .",
    "thus no scaling would be observed in this case , as expected for first - order transitions .",

    ", we can assign to each fiber a spin variable @xmath456 , whose value depends on whether the fiber is intact ( @xmath465 ) or broken ( @xmath466 ) .",
    "the effective field is formally given by @xmath467 where @xmath355 is the fiber threshold , @xmath468 is the load on the fiber @xmath268 , which depends on the external load @xmath79 and on the state of the other fibers .",
    "the dynamics is now similar to the one of the rfim since each `` spin '' follows the local field ( i.e. it breaks when @xmath469 ) . thus changing the disorder strength and the nature of the load sharing",
    "we could obtain a phase diagram of the type depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediag ] .    in the case of els fiber bundles , the load on each fiber is given by @xmath470 , while for lls @xmath468 is a complicated function of the state of the neighboring fibers : if a fiber is close to a crack of length @xmath316 it carries a load of @xmath471 .",
    "the crucial difference between these load sharing rules and ferromagnetic interactions is that for fibers the increase of the effective field due to other fiber breaking grows as the fracture process progresses , while in the rfim this quantity is always given by @xmath458 .",
    "for instance in the case of els , the breaking of a single fiber increases the effective field of the others by a quantity @xmath472 which increases as the fraction of intact fibers @xmath248 decreases .",
    "similarly in the case of lls each time we break a fiber , we increase the effective field of the neighbor by a quantity @xmath473 which becomes larger as more and more fibers break .",
    "this difference has a profound effect on the phase diagram , because it implies that interactions always prevail over disorder .",
    "thus , as the system size increases , the system will necessarily hit the low disorder first - order transition line .",
    "the only exception is provided by the extreme case of a non - normalizable disorder distribution , where we can always find some strong enough bond to resist the load amplification @xcite . in more general cases , however , it is not possible to fine tune the ratio between disorder width and interactions as for the rfim in order to find a critical point where the two effects are perfectly balanced .",
    "thus the `` phase transition '' observed in fiber bundle models is always first - order , with a catastrophic nucleation event preceded by some small precursors .",
    "the scaling observed in the els models is the one associated with a spinodal instability , similar to what is found in the low disorder phase of the rfim in mean - field theory .",
    "when interactions are local , such as for the lls model , the spinodal line can not be reached and the transition is simply first order . with this idea in mind",
    "we can reinterpret the results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : size_bundle ] : as the range of interaction is increased nucleation occurs closer and closer to the spinodal point , as in conventional first - order phase transitions .",
    "having settled the question of fiber bundle models , we can now turn our attention to more complicated lattice models , such as the random fuse model .",
    "the attempts made in the past to map fracture models into spin models are typically based on the lattice green function formalism : removing a bond @xmath268 in the lattice implies that the load in the other bonds has to be changed by a quantity @xmath474 ( the green function ) .",
    "thus we can rewrite the effective field in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eff_field ] ) in terms of @xmath474 and obtain a suitable spin model . for instance , in the random - fuse model @xmath474 can be approximated as the dipolar kernel , but only in the limit where only a few bonds are broken .",
    "it is interesting to remark that in these conditions the green function decays as @xmath475 in two dimensions , which is exactly the crossover point between local and global behavior in the fbm .",
    "this could imply that the spinodal point , inaccessible under lls , could be reached in the rfm , as is also suggested by the simulations discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : rfm_ava ] .",
    "one should take these considerations with due care , since for a generic damage configuration , finding @xmath474 amounts to solving the full problem ( i.e. the kirchhoff equations for the random fuse model ) and is thus practically impossible .",
    "thus we can rigorously map fracture models into spin models only in the dilute limit , which is not , however , the limit of interest in fracture . extrapolating the results of spin models outside their regime of validity leads to inconsistent results , because the stress amplification at the crack tips is not properly captured by the dilute green function .",
    "for instance , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite treat in mean - field theory the spin model obtained from green function formalism . neglecting the load amplification in their analysis ( i.e. the load transfer is chosen to be independent of the state )",

    "we have discussed in section [ sec : exp ] that experiments in several materials under different loading conditions , lead to a rough crack surface described by self - affine scaling .",
    "the simplest theoretical approach to the problem identifies the crack front with a deformable line pushed by the external stress through a random toughness landscape and the trail of the line yields the fracture surface @xcite .",

    "unfortunately , experimental results are normally obtained under mode i loading conditions , at least effectively , while mode iii cracks tend to be unstable .",
    "given the results discussed above , we would conclude that crack roughening is probably more complicated than a simple depinning problem of a linear elastic line moving in a disordered landscape .",
    "nonetheless the depinning picture is quite appealing , since it relates the observed scaling behavior to a non - equilibrium critical point . to obtain a quantitative explanation of the experiments , it is necessary to analyze in detail further modifications of the basic depinning problem , including for instance the combined effects of the anelastic fracture process zone , the formation of microcrack , plastic flow , or elastodynamics . among these proposals the most promising pathway for future investigation",
    "is probably represented by the effect of non - linear elasticity .",
    "the depinning of a non - linear long - range elastic line has been recently studied by renormalization group for contact line depinning , a problem that is formally equivalent to a planar crack @xcite .",

    "then the main effect is that single - connectedness is no longer sufficient since simple maxwell - counting demonstrates that the degrees of freedom are not balanced by the constraints at hand .",
    "several often - used lattices become unstable ( e.g. simply cubic ones , like the square one ) against deformation .",
    "the critical behavior is now called _ rigidity percolation _ , and its nature is still a not completely resolved question , e.g. with regards to its order in two dimensions - whether it is simply second - order similar to percolation or not @xcite . for studies of central - force system fracture in diluted systems the implications are not quite clear either . with increasing damage , at some point",

    "another example of percolation - related processes in the fracture context is given by continuum percolation , where one considers the transport properties of a medium with a set of voids or defects .",
    "the difference to the lattice case is now due to the fact that the `` bottlenecks '' of the spanning cluster can have a ( naturally ) varying distribution of properties .",

    "( [ eq : binsize ] ) with @xmath820 ( from ref .",
    "we would like to conclude the present review by trying to answer two essential questions : ( i ) what can be learned from statistical models in order to reach a better understanding of fracture in quasi - brittle materials and interpret relevant experiments and ( ii ) what kind of developments can be foreseen to improve the current theoretical / modeling framework .",
    "the first question involves as well an assessment of the possible advantages of the statistical mechanics strategy with respect to traditional damage mechanics approaches . on the other hand , answering the second question will also help to clarify the limitations of statistical lattice models and their role in the future .    the macroscopic behavior of lattice models is well described using the terminology of phase transitions and the ensuing picture is conceptually rather simple : in the stress - controlled case crossing the peak - load implies a first - order transition to a `` broken state '' .",
    "this means that regardless of system size and disorder strength , the correlations in damage are local albeit with a growing characteristic length .",
    "this lengthscale does not diverge however as the peak - load is approached in contrast to that of a second - order transition .",
    "such a picture has automatic consequences for the scaling of thermodynamic quantities as the conductivity or stiffness , damage and strength distributions .",
    "in particular , scaling laws inspired from critical phenomena typically fail to describe the size dependence of these quantities .",
    "the statistical properties are instead well captured by relatively simple laws , such as gaussian or lognormal distributions , whose precise origin , however , is not always clear and remains a topic for future research .",
    "there are still interesting issues left , such as the most appropriate mathematical framework for measuring the damage anisotropy and correlations , or understanding the dynamics of microcrack populations .",
    "it would be important to carry out an extensive analysis for vectorial fracture models , even though such quasistatic brittle fracture models are expected to have the same kind of `` phase diagram '' in the statistical mechanics language . presumably allowing for several modes of element failure will also influence the right description of damage , summarized by the classical damage mechanics question whether it makes sense to use scalar damage parameter @xmath92 .",
    "next we would like to summarize with a few points the picture obtained from the theoretical approaches discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] and the numerical simulations reported in sec .",
    "[ sec : simul ] and compare the results with the experimental data analyzed in sec .",
    "[ sec : exp ] .",
    "an additional question that naturally follows from statistical models is the role of internal disorder for macroscopic damage laws used in engineering applications .",
    "one of the successes of statistical models of fracture has been to shed light into the scaling of strength with sample size and the associated distributions .",
    "there are indications that the asymptotics of extremal statistics are not the only alternative to explain the strength distribution , which results instead from cooperative phenomena or fluctuations in the damage accumulation . while for weak disorder the weibull distribution provides an adequate fit to the data , for strong disorder we observe a lognormal strength distribution .",
    "whether this is a general result valid at all scales or the signature of a crossover behavior to gumbel or weibull scalings , still remains to be explored .",
    "a possible pathway to understand these results could stem from fiber bundle models ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : fiber ] ) . under lls conditions the model displays an extremal type distribution and a logarithmic size effect .",
    "conversely under els the distribution becomes gaussian and size effects are absent .",
    "a clever way to interpolate between lls and els was suggested by hidalgo et al .",
    "@xcite through a long - range rule in which the stress is transfered as @xmath821 .",
    "the crossover between lls and els is identified with @xmath822 , which corresponds with the exponent of the green function obtained from lattice models , such as the rfm .",
    "hence these models lie exactly at the boundary between lls and els and the lognormal distribution could then arise from the competition between local and global effects in a strongly disordered environment . here",
    ", we would like to call for further basic science -oriented experiments . in the materials science -community it is customary to use the weibull scaling to describe strength .",
    "however , it is clear that it is very rare to have a situation in which one would a priori expect that the conditions underlying the weibull statistics are valid .",
    "lattice models are also useful to analyze the effect on strength coming from the interplay between elastic interactions and disorder in notched samples . for instance , the data displayed in sec .",
    "[ sec : notch ] show the various mechanisms by which disorder can mask the classical lefm prediction involving a @xmath823-type scaling .",
    "the rfm has typically a rather small fracture process zone which decreases in size , for a fixed notch - to - sample size -ratio @xmath196 .",
    "the simple lesson we can draw from the model is that in practice one may , for a limited range of sample sizes , expect to get almost any strength exponent ( in the law @xmath824 ) between @xmath825 ( or logarithmic behavior ) and the @xmath752 prediction indicated by lefm .",
    "it is interesting to close the present discussion by analyzing the predictions for strength coming from two other theoretical frameworks commonly used to interpret statistical properties of fracture , namely percolation ( sec .  [",
    "sec : perc ] ) and depinning ( sec .",
    "[ sec : depinning ] ) .",
    "percolation describes rigorously the infinite disorder limit of lattice models , where stress enhancement is irrelevant , the bonds fail one by one , and no real size effect is expected besides the small corrections associated with finite size scaling .",
    "the infinite disorder limit is useful as a theoretical idealization but is not relevant in practical cases , where the disorder distribution might be broad but remains normalizable . in that case",
    ", only the initial stage of damage accumulation resembles percolation , but eventually a catastrophic process is initiated and size effects , both in damage and strength are observed in agreement with experiments .",
    "the depinning approach is applicable instead to the weak disorder limit , single crack limit .",
    "strong inhomogeneities would break up the single valued crack interface that is the starting assumption of the theory . according to the depinning scenario , the crack interface moves , eventually leading to the failure of the sample , when the stress intensity factor on the crack overcomes a critical threshold @xmath482 .",
    "since we deal here with a non - equilibrium phase transition , as in percolation , we do not expect to see size effects in @xmath482 , besides the usual finite size corrections ( i.e. @xmath826 for @xmath827 ) .",
    "other possible size effects are hidden in the definition of the stress intensity factor . in other words , a depinning transition alone can not account for the observed size effects but can at best be used to describe the crack dynamics and morphology once crack growth has been initiated .      we have discussed both the experimental ( in sec .  [ sec : rough - exp ] ) , theoretical ( in sec .  [ sec : depinning ] ) and simulation - based ( in sec .",
    "[ sec : rough ] ) crack roughness analysis . as we discussed",
    "extensively there are several possible definitions of the roughness exponent , depending on the experimental conditions ( dimensionality of the sample , loading mode ) and on the measured surface properties ( in plane or out of plane , parallel or perpendicular , local or global roughness ) .",
    "this variety of exponents makes a direct comparison between theory and experiments quite involved . in order to simplify this task",
    "we report in table  [ table : exp_rough ] the values of the roughness exponents measured in experiments , as well as the predictions of the models .",
    ".a summary of the values of the roughness exponent measured in experiments , in the rfm and in the depinning transition ( dt ) scenario , both with long - range ( lr ) and ( sr ) interactions .",
    "refer to sec .",

    "[ sec : depinning ] for the depinning transition .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to summarize , the numerical simulation results presented in tables a1-a4 for 2d triangular random fuse networks indicate that sparse direct solvers based on multiple - rank sparse cholesky downdating are superior to the competing iterative schemes using block - circulant and optimal circulant preconditioners .",
    "on the other hand , for 3d lattice systems , the block - circulant preconditioner based cg solver exhibits superior performance ( for system sizes @xmath828 ) over the sparse direct solvers and the related incomplete cholesky preconditioned cg solvers .",
    "in addition , for both 2d and 3d lattice systems , the block circulant preconditioned cg is superior to the _ optimal _ circulant preconditioned pcg solver , which in turn is superior to the fourier accelerated pcg solvers used in refs . @xcite ."
