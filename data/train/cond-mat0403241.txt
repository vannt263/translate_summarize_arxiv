    "a wide variety of surfaces are present in nature where surface roughness is well described in terms of self - affine fractal scaling spanning various length scales @xmath5 for example , the kilometer - scale structure of mountain terrain @xcite to nanometer - scale topology of thin films obtained by deposition of atoms or molecules on substrates @xcite and of ion - bombarded surfaces @xcite . various physical processes including fracture , ion bombardment , molecular beam epitaxy etc .",
    "produce this kind of surface morphology . in thin film deposition",
    "the morphology of the bare surfaces of substrates prior to thin film deposition can also influence the morphology of the deposited films . to a large extent",
    "the usefulness of thin films in terms of mechanical , optical and electrical properties depends on the surface morphology .",
    "it is important to understand growth mechanisms leading to various surface morphologies .",
    "ion irradiation and molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) @xmath5 both used in advanced modern technology @xmath5 affect surface morphologies in different ways . in the case of heteroepitaxial mbe growth",
    "there are three different growth modes @xmath5 layer - by - layer ( frank - van der merwe or fm ) , island ( volmer - weber or vw ) and layer - plus - island ( stranski - krastanov or sk ) @xcite .",
    "thus mbe growth can produce different surface morphologies .",
    "which growth mode will be adopted in a given system depends on the surface free energy of the substrate , free energy of the film , their interface energy and the strain energy due to lattice mismatch .",
    "thus the surface morphology is governed by these parameters .",
    "ion bombardment produces rough surface as well as smooth surface under different experimental conditions .",
    "a common feature of most of the ion - bombarded surfaces is self - affine fractal structure .",
    "the fractal dimensions of such self - affine surfaces can be controlled .",
    "the adhesion of a thin film deposited on a fractal surface is expected to be affected by the fractal dimension of the substrate surface @xcite .",
    "this inspires studies of the morphology of mbe - grown thin films on ion - irradiated substrates . here",
    "we report our results of such studies and compare the growth on pristine and ion - irradiated surfaces .",
    "ion - solid interaction alters the topography of solid surfaces via competing surface roughening and smoothing processes .",
    "these competing processes are responsible for the creation of surface features like quasiperiodic ripple @xcite and self - affine fractal topographies @xcite . in the ion mass - energy regime",
    "where sputtering is dominant , surface roughening is observed @xcite .",
    "when ion - beam induced effective surface diffusion dominates surface smoothing is observed @xcite .",
    "the smoothed surface can also be a self - affine fractal surface @xcite .",
    "surface morphology is often described by some statistical parameters .",
    "most common are the surface width ( @xmath6 ) , represented by the root - mean - square roughness value , and the in - plane correlation length ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the correlation length is the average distance between features in the surface profiles within which the surface variations are correlated .",
    "surface width is an important parameter that represents a measurement of the correlations along the direction of the surface growth .",
    "scaling studies can be performed by measuring surface roughness at various length scales .",
    "root - mean - square surface roughness @xmath6 is defined as @xmath7 ^ 2>^{1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the surface height at a point @xmath9 on the surface and @xmath10 is the average height . if the horizontal sampling length on the surface is @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , the surface is termed self - affine @xcite .",
    "the value of the scaling exponent @xmath14 indicates how roughness changes with length scales .",
    "however , it does not tell whether the surface is roughened or smoothed upon any kind of surface treatment .",
    "small @xmath14 values are associated with jagged surfaces ( anticorrelation ) while large values indicate well correlated , smoothed - textured surfaces . the surface width ( rms roughness )",
    "scales with linear length @xmath11 for @xmath15 and for @xmath16 rms roughness @xmath17 . for the case",
    "@xmath18 ( lattice spacing of the system ) the analytical form of roughness can be written as @xcite : @xmath19 in ion - surface interaction , in a previous work we observed ion - beam induced surface smoothing and the smoothed surface to be self - affine .",
    "2.0 mev si@xmath20 ions bombarded on a si(100 ) surface ( hereafter denoted ib ) with the fluences in the range @xmath21 ions/@xmath22 , produced a self - affine fractal surface with a scaling exponent @xmath23 at length scales below 50 nm @xcite . in ion - atom collisions in solids and at the surface , the elastic energy lost by an ion is transferred to a recoil atom , which itself collides with other atoms in the solid and so forth . in this way",
    "the ion creates what is called a collision cascade .",
    "the displaced atoms in this collision cascade may acquire a kinetic energy enough to escape from the solid surface @xmath5 a phenomenon known as sputtering .",
    "however , if the energy ( component normal to the surface ) of the displaced atoms is smaller than the surface binding energy , the atoms may reach the surface but can not leave the surface .",
    "they can , however , drift parallel to the surface providing an effective surface diffusion .",
    "apparently this ion - beam induced effective surface diffusion causes nanometer - scale surface smoothing @xcite .",
    "discovery of this ion - irradiation induced nanoscale surface smoothing phenomenon leading to a self - affine fractal surface inspired further investigations @xcite including the present one .    in surface studies and epitaxial thin film growth , thermal treatment of the solid substrate is almost inevitable .",
    "thermal treatment of ion - bombarded surfaces ( hereafter denoted tib ) produced a self - affine surface with a different roughness exponent with both smoothing and roughening below and above a particular length scale , respectively . at length scales below @xmath24 nm ,",
    "thermal treatment was found to cause further smoothing of the ion - bombardment induced smooth surface ( ib ) .",
    "however , at length scales above @xmath24 nm the surface roughness of the tib samples increases for lateral dimensions upto @xmath25 nm with a scaling exponent @xmath260.04 over the entire range covering both smoothing and roughening regimes @xcite . scaling studies for ge growth on this surface as well as on the pristine si(100 ) surface are reported here .",
    "another motivation for the study of growth of ge on ion - irradiated si surfaces is related to our earlier studies of growth of ge nanostructures on silicon @xcite .",
    "growth of ge nanodots and nanowires on polymer - coated si surfaces indicated that nanodots are arranged on defects , which might be utilized to fabricate lattices of nanodots .",
    "patterned defect structures can be created on si by ion - irradiation .",
    "ge growth on this patterned surface could possibly be used to form ge nanodot lattices . however",

    "following irradiation the sample was taken out and inserted into an ultrahigh vacuum ( uhv ) chamber ( pressure : 3@xmath33 10@xmath34 mbar ) containing an omicron variable temperature scanning tunneling microscope . scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) measurements were performed at room temperature .",
    "the roughness measurements were made on both the pristine as well as the irradiated half of the sample with a thin ( @xmath35 1.5 nm ) native oxide layer . for preparing a clean silicon surface ,",
    "the sample was degassed about 600@xmath36c for 12 hours prior to the flashing at 1200@xmath36c for 2@xmath53 minutes under uhv condition ( 1@xmath37 mbar ) in a molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) growth chamber .",

    "after removal of the native oxide by thermal treatment , the roughness of the irradiated ( tib ) surface is found to be much larger compared to the pristine ( tp ) surface .",
    "the reason for this has been explained in ref.@xcite by monte carlo simulation results showing atomic displacements at the ion - bombarded oxide / si interface .",
    "the loss of symmetry and the new structure formation on the tib surface is apparently responsible for the difference in morphology of the ge - deposited surfaces in fig.1(c ) and fig.2(b ) [ also fig.2(c ) ] .",
    "the difference in morphologies of the clean surfaces as seen in fig.1(a ) [ also fig.1(b ) ] and fig.2(a ) would lead to a difference in adhesion of deposited atoms on them .",
    "the smoothing observed at smaller length scales upon ge - deposition on the tib surface indicates that the ge atoms fill the surface troughs , where the deposited atoms would have more nearest neighbors for better bonding .",
    "[ for length scales @xmath61 nm the ge - deposited tib surface is also smoother than the ge - deposited tp surface ] .",
    "the theoretical work of palasantzas and hosson @xcite predicting that the adhesion of a thin film deposited on a fractal surface would depend on the fractal dimension of the substrate surface needs to be further explored through experimental investigations .",
    "considering the fact that the ion - irradiation was performed at @xmath62 mbar , one may wonder about deposition of c on the irradiated surface and its influence on subsequent results .",
    "however , we do not expect any significant c deposition .",

    "roughness scaling behavior of thin ge films on ion - irradiated and pristine si(100 ) surfaces has been investigated .",
    "ge was deposited after removal of the native oxide under ultrahigh vacuum condition . on the pristine surface , upon ge deposition , although the roughness increases more than an order of magnitude the roughness exponent @xmath14 changes from 0.19 to 0.11 . on the ion - irradiated surface ,",
    "ge deposition causes surface smoothing with roughness exponent changing from 0.82 to 0.99 . in these two cases , different fractal dimensions of the fractal surfaces of the substrates , 2.81 for the pristine and 2.18 for the ion - irradiated ,",
