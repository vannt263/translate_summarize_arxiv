    "the cosmic acceleration is now considered to be one of the frontier quest of fundamental physics . confirmed by observations",
    "( @xcite and @xcite ) , understanding of acceleration is yet to be satisfied in the regime of standard general relativity .",
    "attempts to explain the acceleration could be performed by adding extra components of fluid into energy - momentum tensor part of the einstein field equation .",
    "this extra component , dubbed dark energy , gives negative pressure so that it is able to drive the acceleration , see e.g. references in @xcite for reviews . at smaller scales ,",
    "a problem of an extra attractive gravity in galaxies and galaxy clusters shows up .",
    "effects of extra gravity such as flat galactic rotational curve , gravitational lensing , bulk velocity and structure formation are explained with dark matter @xcite .",
    "on observation side , the simplest model of dark matter and dark energy - the @xmath0cdm model is favored however suffering from fine - tuning problem . at present ,",
    "nature of dark sectors is still unknown .",
    "there is another more radical way of acquiring acceleration . that is to modify the gravity term in the action",
    "( see @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "it is possible that dark energy and dark matter is only a single entity and it could effectively have different behaviors at early and late times .",
    "this unified scenario is considered in chaplygin gas model @xcite .",
    "the chaplygin gas model however can not satisfy cosmic microwave background power spectrum and structure formation @xcite .",
    "another idea of unifying dark sectors was proposed recently by banados @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the model called eddington - born - infeld ( ebi ) gravity can account for both dark matter and dark energy components without additional degrees of freedom in energy - momentum tensor . in the model ,",
    "einstein gravity couples to born - infeld theory giving rise to a bi - metric theory .",
    "the second metric of the theory is generated from the born - infeld christoffel symbol , @xmath1 which is solely responsible for dark sectors .",
    "the theory predicts a dust - like effective equation of state at large scale , while at late time it behaves like a cosmological constant .",
    "the theory can also accommodate flat galactic disk - rotational curves .",
    "the model is motivated by a combination of eddington s idea of purely affine theory of gravity without using metric @xcite , born - infeld - einstein action @xcite , and the idea of magnetic spin symmetry breaking in presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "considering that topological manifold is invariant under full diffeomorphism group of transformation , riemannian manifolds are invariant under smaller class of subgroup of metric isometries .",
    "the eddington action which is diffeomorphism invariant hence is considered as an unbroken state theory @xcite . moreover , it is a ghost - free theory .",
    "introducing @xmath2 to the gravitational theory would break this symmetry similar to having external magnetic field applying to a random spin system .",
    "the external magnetic field also breaks the symmetry of the spin system .",
    "if we let the metric couple to the eddington action , the result is the ebi action . in the action",
    ", there is the einstein - hilbert part and the ebi part ( see @xcite for more detailed discussion ) . in context of anisotropic universe with bianchi type i model , at late time , the ebi gravity effectively behaves like einstein - hilbert cosmology plus cosmological constant .",
    "the ebi term is stable at dark matter phase but also gives rise to anisotropic pressure and the perturbation decays oscillatory in time which differs from standard exponential decay case @xcite . considering the dark energy phase , the born - infeld as dark energy is not stable and it produces a very strong integrated sachs - wolfe effect on large scales .",
    "this suggests that for the model to be viable , cosmological constant is needed in the action @xcite . when adding a cosmological constant into the model , the model still predicts too large cmb fluctuation compared to wmap5 data .",
    "however while restricting the ebi field as dark matter , the ebi model is a best fit with the @xmath0cdm prediction @xcite .",
    "the idea that eddington action is a starting point for general relativity is pursued further more when considering a born - infeld part and a cosmological constant but without having einstein - hilbert term .",
    "the idea was investigated in palatini formulation to include matter fields . for homogeneous and isotropic space - time , the model present a non - singular cosmology at early time as well as non - singular collapsing of compact objects @xcite . in such a scenario ,",
    "poisson equation is modified and jean length is equal to the fundamental length of the theory .",
    "also the critical mass for a blackhole to form is equal to the fundamental mass of the theory @xcite .    here in this paper , we consider ebi model without cosmological constant as originally proposed in @xcite .",
    "in fact , we believe that introducing a cosmological constant would make this model less attractive , as the model was introduced as a way to explain both dark energy and dark matter at the same time . in other words , adding a cosmological constant by hand would mean that the model achieves only half of the original goals it was introduced for .",
    "we re - emphasize the inviability of the original ebi model by fitting it with wmap7 , bao and supernova type ia data .",
    "compared to the study of @xcite , where the authors studied the growth of structure for these models ( they studied the evolution of the cosmological perturbations during radiation and matter domination ) we perform a study of the background and look for the constraints on it coming from the most recent data . in section ii , we briefly describe the ebi model as a bi - metric theory and its cosmology .",
    "the equations of motion are described in section iii .",

    "now we assume that the dominant dark component behaves as dark matter , whereas @xmath63 , that is , the matter component reduces to the baryon component and we suppose it is not the dominant one . in this case",

    ". however , there could be a transient solution from @xmath56 and @xmath64 which could still mimic a dark - matter component .",

    "we look for de sitter solution that is @xmath67 .",

    "we find @xmath70 furthermore , the equations of motion give @xmath71 which implies that @xmath72 .",
    "we can also write @xmath73 4 .",
    "dark energy for the case @xmath74 : let us consider the case when , at very late times , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , but still @xmath78 , as well as @xmath79 .",
    "then , by neglecting any constant term with respect to the @xmath31 term , we find the following two conditions which need to be satisfied @xmath80 which imply @xmath81 this solution is not a de sitter solution , as in fact we find @xmath82",

    "notice that @xmath85 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : hds ] ) , and implies @xmath86 , for @xmath72 .",
    "this further implies that the two branches , on their de sitter solution , will differ by the sign of the final value of @xmath31 .",
    "let us solve the equations of motion from a given redshift ( @xmath87 ) , such that at @xmath88 the universe is in the radiation era .",
    "we will set the initial condition for the hubble parameter , during the radiation era , as the one given by gr , namely @xmath89 in what follows , we will fix the value of @xmath90 , during radiation era , at @xmath91 , such that @xmath92 which will be set equal to a fixed value . in this model , we have five parameters , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath8 , @xmath53 .",
    "however , we will fix the initial condition for @xmath95 by requiring the condition @xmath96 to hold .",
    "finally , the four parameters , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath8 , @xmath53 , will be considered to be free . in particular , since the @xmath31-component is supposed to explain both dark matter and dark energy , we will set the following range @xmath97 .",
    "we run the other parameters to change over a large range , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 .",
    "notice that in this parameter range , the system does not have a @xmath0cdm limit , therefore one expects deviations from the concordance model . since this model has been introduced to explain dark energy and dark matter at the same time , this no-@xmath0cdm limit is in fact well motivated .      we have calculated the total @xmath101 for this model by using wmap7 data ( the background constraints on the two cmb shift parameters @xcite ) , the bao ( sdss7 ) data ( two points ) @xcite , and supernova type ia ( constitution data ) @xcite , following the same method followed in @xcite .",
    "the minimum for the @xmath102 is located at @xmath103 where we have also fixed @xmath104 , and @xmath105 for the reasons already explained above . trying to set priors on @xmath93 like @xmath106 ( i.e.  fixing the scalar field to be the main source of dark matter ) leads to much larger values for @xmath102 .",
    "furthermore , data tends to prefer clearly the @xmath74 case , as for @xmath107 , the @xmath102 increases .    nonetheless , the minimum value for @xmath108 is still much larger than @xmath0cdm s value ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "the @xmath101 for @xmath0cdm has two free degrees of freedom ( @xmath110 , @xmath0 ) that we can vary . therefore according to the @xmath101-probability distribution , at 95% confidence level , @xmath0cdm rules out those models , at 2-@xmath111 , whose fit to the same data will lead to @xmath112 . however , the models discussed here have @xmath113 , so that @xmath114 , which implies that these models are excluded at 2-@xmath111 .",
    "this large difference implies the model under consideration does not fit the data , already at 2@xmath111 , as well as @xmath0cdm .",
    "this is tantamount to saying that the @xmath0cdm cosmological evolution rules out this class of models .",
    "since the @xmath102 for the model studied here is higher than @xmath0cdm s one , we can deduce that data do not support well the evolution of the effective equation of state plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : wxmin ] .",
    "it should also be pointed out that for the parameters for which @xmath115 , the scalar field , although it has in the past @xmath116 , it is anyhow a subdominant dark matter component ( since on the minimum-@xmath101 solution , the dust - like dark matter contributes up to @xmath117 ) .",
    "this implies that the scalar field starts dominating the evolution of the universe only at late times , that is it contributes to the dynamics essentially only as a dark energy field .",
    "but it is a dark energy field which , at early times , it is quite different from a cosmological constant : this may be part of the reason why , in this case , the model can not not fit the data well .",
    "one option would be adding a bare cosmological constant ( as also proposed in @xcite ) , but in this case the model loses part of the interest as it would stop being an attractive dark energy model . furthermore the evolution tends to lead to a fast transition of the effective equation - of - state parameter .",
    "this may also contribute to a worse fit to the data compared to @xmath0cdm .",

    "we have studied the eddington - born - infeld scalar field which was proposed to model both dark matter and dark energy at the same time .",
    "we have solved the equations of motion and studied the behavior of the background at different times : at early times , indeed the scalar field behaves as a dark matter component with equation of state parameter @xmath116 . only at late times , the field can lead the dynamics of the universe to an accelerated regime , which depending on the parameters of the model , is described by either a de sitter solution , or a rather different dynamics described by @xmath121 , and @xmath78 ( where a prime denotes differentiation with respect to the @xmath35 ) .",
    "the fact that , at early times , the scalar field behaves as a dust component can in principle alleviate the problem of finding a dark matter component , as indeed the nature of dark matter and dark energy would have the same explanation .    in order to see whether this model is viable or not",
    ", we studied the cosmological constraints that its dynamics have to pass when considering wmap7 data , bao and supernova type ia . for this goal",

    "we have proved this statement by constraining the background .",
    "this approach differs from the one followed in @xcite , where the authors studied the evolution of the cosmological perturbations in order to constrain the growth of structures .",
    "in particular , we have used only the constraints on the background coming from the wmap7 data .",
    "instead in @xcite , the authors considered constraints only on the perturbations power - spectrum .",
    "it is possible , as also suggested in @xcite that introducing a cosmological constant would improve the fit , but , on the other hand , the model would partially lose its original motivation of explaining at the same time both dark energy and dark matter .",
    "in particular data prefers the non - de sitter solution , preferring a fast transition to values for @xmath119 . in this model , at early times , a cosmological constant is absent from the beginning , as the scalar field initially ( and up to very recently ) behaves as a dark matter component .",
