    "in the exploration of the solar system , comets have been targeted by various space missions . after successful encounter of comet 9p / temple 1 on 4 july 2005 ,",
    "the nasa s deep impact mission , also called epoxi mission , under it s extended investigation program dixi will encounter comet 103p / hartley 2 on 4 november 2010 , with closest approach around 700 km from the nucleus .",
    "this comet has been observed by several space telescopes in different spectral regions @xcite .",
    "the first clear detection of the cameron band ( a@xmath1 - x@xmath2 ) of co was reported by @xcite in hst / fos spectrum of comet 103 p / hartley 2 . since",
    "cameron band emission is a forbidden transition , resonance fluorescence is not an effective excitation mechanism .",
    "the upper state of this emission ( a@xmath1 ) is a metastable state with lifetime of 3 ms @xcite , which is quite small .",
    "thus , cameron band emissions are treated as `` prompt emissions '' and can be used to probe distribution of parent species if this emission is produced in dissociative excitation of a molecular species .",
    "photodissociative excitation of co@xmath0 is considered as the major production mechanism of co cameron band and has been used to trace the distribution and abundance of co@xmath0 on comets @xcite .    besides photodissociative excitation of co@xmath0 , there are other channels of excitation of co molecule in the a@xmath1 state .",
    "it has been shown that photoelectrons generated by solar euv radiation also play an important role in excitation , dissociation , and ionization processes leading to emission and chemistry in cometary comae ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "recently , @xcite demonstrated the importance of photoelectron impact excitation in comets , and showed that electron impact on co gives 40% contribution to the total co fourth positive emission .",
    "the presence of photoelectron excitation in cometary coma is clearly publicised by detection of oi 1356   emission in comets ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , since this emission being a spin - forbidden transition can not be produced by solar fluorescence .",
    "there are other siginificant evidences for an important role of photoelectron excitation in cometary coma ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to photon and electron impact reactions , dissociative electron recombination reactions of co@xmath5-bearing ions can also produce co in the a@xmath1 excited state .",
    "our aim in this paper is to study various production and loss mechanisms of co(a@xmath1 ) and to estimate the contribution of photoelectron impact excitation of co and co@xmath0 in the production of cameron band for different relative abundances of co@xmath0 on comet 103 p / hartley 2 : the target of epoxi mission . since model calculations depend on input solar flux , we have estimated its sensitivity on the calculated intensity of cameron band emission .",
    "we show that photoelectron impact on co and co@xmath0 are dominant processes ( @xmath66090% contribution ) in producing co molecule in ( a@xmath1 ) state . around the epoxi encounter epoch predictions",
    "are made for the brightness of cameron band on for comet 103p / hartley 2 , which will be observed by several space - based telescopes including hst .",
    "we have developed a model for the production of cameron band emission on comets , which uses the basic coupled chemistry model described in detail in our earlier papers @xcite .",
    "various sources of production and loss of co(a@xmath1 ) are summarized in table [ prodlosstab ] .",
    "the total water production rate is taken as 6.3 @xmath7 10@xmath8 s@xmath9 for comet 103p / hartley 2 @xcite .    to evaluate the effect of solar euv flux on model calculations , we have considered 2 solar flux models : euvac model of @xcite and solar 2000 ( s2k ) model of @xcite .",
    "the degradation of the solar uv - euv radiation and solar euv - generated photoelectrons in the coma is modeled using the method of @xcite and further developed by @xcite .",
    "the electron impact production rates are calculated using the analytical yield spectrum ( ays ) approach , which is based on the monte carlo method .",
    "details of ays approach are given in several of the previous papers @xcite .",
    "the current model takes into account the most recently published cross sections for the photon impact and electron impact dissociation , ionization , and excitation processes for the gases in the coma . the cross section for photodissociative excitation of co@xmath0 producing co in a@xmath1 state",
    "is calculated using absorption cross sections of co@xmath0 and yield of cameron band measured by @xcite .",
    "the cross section for electron impact excitation of co(a@xmath1 ) from co is taken from @xcite and for dissociative excitation of co@xmath0 is taken from @xcite . the electron temperature profile required for dissociative recombination reactions",
    "is taken from @xcite and is assumed to be same as on comet halley .",
    "calculations are made for the comet 103p / hartley 2 at heliocentric distance of 0.96 au .",
    "the photodissociation of co@xmath0 producing co in a@xmath1 state is determined by solar flux mainly in the wavelength region 550 to 1050  .",
    "table  [ a3piprodtab ] presents the calculated photon production frequencies of co(a@xmath1 ) for two different solar flux models .",
    "the co(a@xmath1 ) production frequencies calculated for photoelectron impact on co@xmath0 and co are also shown in the same table for the corresponding solar flux models .",
    "our calculated photodissociation frequencies are about 50% to a factor of 2 lower than those reported by @xcite .    using euvac solar flux , the calculated radial profile of volume production rate for the various sources of co(a@xmath1 ) at the relative abundance of 4% co@xmath0 and 0.5% co",
    "are shown in figure  [ proda3pi ] . at 100 km",
    "cometocentric distance , the dominant source of production of co(a@xmath1 ) is electron impact of co@xmath0 ( @xmath650% ) followed by electron impact of co ( @xmath625% ) , and photodissociation of co@xmath0 ( @xmath615% ) .",
    "the contributions from dissociative recombination reactions are quite small ( @xmath105% ) at lower cometocentric distances , but the recombination of co@xmath11 is a significant ( @xmath1230% ) source at 1000 km and beyond .",
    "figure  [ lossa3pi ] shows radial profile of various loss processes of co(a@xmath1 ) for the same relative composition of co@xmath0 and co. since lifetime of co in excited state ( a@xmath1 ) is very short ( @xmath63 ms ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the radiative decay is the dominant loss process .",
    "collisional quenching of co(a@xmath1 ) by cometary neutral species is negligible since 103p / hartley 2 is a low production rate comet .",
    "but in the case of large production rate comets , like hale - bopp , quenching by water would be a dominant loss process in the innermost part of the coma .",

    "the volume emission rate for 3 transitions ( 0 - 0 , 1 - 0 , 0 - 1 ) of cameron band emission are calculated using the following formula @xmath14 where v(r ) is total volume excitation rate of co(a@xmath1 ) at cometocentric distance r , q@xmath15 is the franck - condon factor for transition , a@xmath16 is einstein transition probability from upper state @xmath17 to lower state @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is optical depth . since resonance fluorescence is not",
    "an effective excitation mechanism for the cameron band and the total gas production rate is only 6.3 @xmath7 10@xmath8 s@xmath9 , the cometary coma can be safely assumed to be optically thin .",
    "the franck - condon factors are taken from @xcite and branching ratios from @xcite",
    ". the relative contributions of ( 1 - 0 ) , ( 0 - 0 ) , ( 0 - 1 ) transitions to the total cameron band are 13.9% , 10.4% , and 14.7% , respectively .",
    "table  [ bigtab ] presents the model calculated slit - averaged brightness of ( 1 - 0 ) , ( 0 - 0 ) , ( 0 - 1 ) transitions of cameron band , as well as total cameron band brightness and height - integrated column brightness for different relative abundances of co and co@xmath0 corresponding to the hst observation of comet 103p / hartley 2 on september 18 - 19 , 1991 . due to the absence of co fourth positive emission in this comet @xcite , the abundance of co",
    "is constrained to 0.5% .",
    "however , we do consider a case of 1% of co to evaluate it s implications on the results .",
    "this table also depicts fractional contribution of photodissociation of co@xmath0 , photoelectron impact of co and co@xmath0 , and dissociative recombination of co@xmath11 to the total calculated brightness at 3 projected distances ( 10@xmath20 , 10@xmath21 , and 10@xmath22 km ) from the nucleus .",
    "since the production rates of photodissociative excitation of co@xmath0 , and photoelectron impact of co and co@xmath0 , are dependent on input solar flux model , results are presented for the euvac and s2k solar fluxes relevant to the date of comet observation which was in solar maximum condition .",
    "the hst observation of 0 - 0 transition of cameron band is 35 rayleigh @xcite , which is consistent with model calculated brightness for the relative abundance of 4 to 5% of co@xmath0 and 0.5% co when euvac solar flux is used . in this case , at 100 km , the photoelectron impact of co@xmath0 ( 50% ) and co ( 25% ) contribute around 75% , while photodissociative excitation of co@xmath0 is @xmath1215% . at 1000 km and beyond ,",
    "the contribution due to electron impact of co@xmath0 and co is about 6070% while those of dissociative recombination of co@xmath11 is @xmath61530% and of photodissociative excitation of co@xmath0 @xmath610% only . on an average ,",
    "the photoelectron impact of co@xmath0 and co contribute about 60 - 75% to the production of cameron band emission , while photodissociative excitation of co@xmath0 contribute about 10 - 15% only . in the case of s2k solar flux model , the co@xmath0 abundance of 3 to 4% is required to match hst - observed cameron band 0 - 0 transition brightness . here",
    "the contribution of photodissociative excitation of co@xmath0 is @xmath620% , while the electron impact of co@xmath0 and co together contribute @xmath665% , to the total cameron band emission . when the co abundance is doubled to 1% of water the relative contribution due to electron impact on co increases resulting in the reduction ( by @xmath61% ) in the requirement for co@xmath0 abundace to match the hst - observation brightness .",
    "however , there is no major change in the percentage contributions due to photodissociation and photoelectron impact excitation of co and co@xmath0 .",
    "hence , we conclude that the photodissociative excitation of co@xmath0 is not the dominant source for the production of cameron band in comets .",
    "the summery of table  [ bigtab ] and the above results is that whatever be the relative abundances of co@xmath0 and co , and the solar input flux , the photodissociation contribution is in the range of 520% , while photoelectron impact excitation contribution is about 5080% .",
    "we conclude that photoelectron impact excitation of cameron band in comets is much more important than was thought previously .",
    "further , the contribution due to photoelectron impact excitation of co is significant and vary between 20 - 50% . we have also shown that dissociative recombination of co@xmath11 ion is also a significant source of cameron band at cometocentric distances @xmath231000 km with contribution of as high as 30% .",
    "hence , the derivation of co@xmath0 abundances based on the assumption that photodissociation of co@xmath0 is major mechanism should be revisited .",
    "the results presented in this paper suggest that cameron band emission may not be used to probe cometary co@xmath0 abundance uniquely .",
    "the epoxi mission will encounter the comet 103p / hartley 2 on 4 november 2010 when comet will be at heliocentric distance of 1.06 au and geocentric distance 0.15 au . in the current solar minimum period , using our model we have estimated the intensity of cameron band around mission encounter date by taking solar flux on 1 sept .",
    "2010 for both euvac and s2k solar flux models .",
    "the calculated cameron band intensity is tabulated in table  [ bigtab ] for the relative abundance of 4% of co@xmath0 and 0.5% of co. for euvac solar flux , the predicted height - integrated column intensity of cameron band is 1365 r , in which 1 - 0 , 0 - 0 , and 0 - 1 band transitions contribute 189 , 142 , 200 r , respectively .",
    "figure  [ proja3pi ] presents the total cameron band predicted brightness profile as a function of projected distances from the nucleus . for the same relative abundances of co@xmath0 and co and the solar s2k flux ,",
    "the predicted intensity is 1258 r. the results presented in the paper will help in understanding and interpretation of the extensive data to be obtained during epoxi encounter period .                                                                                               and 0.5% of co using euvac solar flux on 18 - 19 sept 1991 .",
