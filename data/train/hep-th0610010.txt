    "hidden extra dimensions is a way to extend four dimensional conventional physics . according to the kaluza klein picture ,",
    "extra dimensions are compactified to a very small length scale ( naturally the planck scale ) , and as a result space time appears to be effectively four dimensional , insofar as low energies are concerned . an alternative picture , which explains why extra dimensions are hidden , is the brane world scenario . in this case",
    "all ordinary particles are assumed to be localized on a three - dimensional brane ( our world ) which is embedded in a multidimensional manifold ( bulk ) , while gravitons are free to propagate in the bulk @xcite .",
    "the brane world scenario has attracted great attention , as it predicts interesting phenomenology even at the tev scale @xcite , and puts on a new basis fundamental problems such as the hierarchy and the cosmological constant problem . according to the nature of the extra dimensions ,",
    "there are two standard brane world models with gravity : a ) in the case of flat extra dimensions we have the add - model @xcite , and b ) in the case of warped extra dimensions we have the first and second randall - shundrum models @xcite .    brane models with bulk scalar fields have also been considered . in ref .",
    "@xcite the existence of a bulk scalar field serves as a way to resolve the cosmological constant problem ( see also @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , the solutions of the model suffer from naked singularities , and this implies a fine - tunning for the five dimensional cosmological constant .",
    "an alternative role of the scalar field is presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this case",
    "the scalar field creates the brane dynamically , by forming a kink topological defect toward the extra dimension . also , nontopological defects appear for a special periodic form of the potential @xcite .    in refs .",
    "@xcite we have studied brane world models with a bulk scalar field non - minimally coupled with gravity , via a possible interaction term of the form @xmath1 .",
    "our motivation was to construct brane models which incorporate a layer - phase mechanism @xcite for the localization of the ordinary particles on the brane .",
    "similar models for phenomenological reasons have also been consider in @xcite .",
    "particularly , in ref .",
    "@xcite , by solving numerically the einstein equations in the case of a non - minimally coupled scalar field , we have obtained three classes of static solutions with different features , in appropriate regions of the free parameters of the model .",
    "the numerical approach we apply in @xcite is suitable for the general case of the potential .",
    "however , we have focused to the case of a massless scalar field assuming the simplest generally accepted form of the potential : @xmath2 .",
    "an analytical study of the same brane model , with a nonminimally coupled scalar , can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper analytical solutions have been found by choosing suitably the potential for the scalar field . for cosmological implications of these models with the nonminimal coupling you can see @xcite .",
    "furthermore , 5d models in the framework of brans - dicke theory have been also studied .",
    "particularly , in ref .",
    "@xcite , static analytical solutions are constructed for a special class of potentials , and the stabilization of the extra dimension is discussed .    an alternative way to go beyond the randall - sundrum model , is to add a gauss - bonnet term to the gravity action , which , in the case of @xmath3 , has the property to keep equations of motion to second order . in the case of @xmath4",
    "the gauss - bonnet term is topological and does not contribute to the classical equations of motion , however it has nontrivial consequences at the level of the conserved currents of the theory @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that , a gauss - bonnet term arises as the leading order quantum correction in the case of the heterotic string theory .",
    "the randall - sundrum model with an additional gauss - bonnet term has been considered in @xcite .",
    "brane models with scalar fields and gauss - bonnet gravity has been also examined in @xcite , while for cosmological implications see for example @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will study brane world models with gauss - bonnet gravity in the presence of a non minimally coupled scalar field .",
    "the motivation is to examine how gauss - bonnet gravity affects the three classes of solutions we obtained in our previous work @xcite .",
    "in this section we will study brane world models with an action of the form : @xmath5 where @xmath6 , and @xmath7 parameterizes the extra dimension .    as we see the above mentioned lagrangian",
    "consists of three terms .",
    "the first term corresponds to the lagrangian of the rs2-model : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the five - dimensional cosmological constant and @xmath10 is the brane tension . in addition @xmath11",
    "is the five - dimensional ricci scalar , @xmath12 is the determinant of the five - dimensional metric tensor @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) , and @xmath15 is the determinant of the induced metric on the brane .",
    "we adopt the mostly plus sign convention @xcite .",
    "the second term is the well - known lagrangian for gauss - bonnet gravity : @xmath16 where we have introduced a new coupling b in conection with the gauss - bonnet term . assuming that this term arises from string theory ( tree level ) the coupling b takes only positive values .",
    "however , in this parer we will consider that the range of b covers all the real axis .",
