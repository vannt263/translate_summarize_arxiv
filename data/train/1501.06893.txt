    "many properties of a galaxy cluster can be measured directly , including cluster richness ( the number of galaxies in the cluster ) , the brightness of each of the cluster galaxies and the morphologies of cluster galaxies .",
    "however some important quantities can not be measured directly but must be inferred from measurable properties .",
    "mass is one such quantity .",
    "thus in order to constrain mass we instead measure quantities that can be related to mass ; these are called mass proxies .",
    "cluster richness is commonly used as a mass proxy , but in order for it to give meaningful results , the relation between mass and richness must be calibrated .",
    "this calibration is referred to as a mass - richness relation .",
    "the mass - richness relations presented in this paper are given in four redshift bins , @xmath0 ( low - z ) , @xmath1 ( mid - z ) , @xmath2 ( high - z ) and @xmath3 ( all - z ) .",

    ". these surveys will assemble large samples of galaxy clusters at redshifts higher than the average @xmath22 of previously found mass - richness relations . beyond cosmology , measurements of cluster mass at higher redshift will provide knowledge about the evolution of galaxy clusters with redshift and about the distribution and mass of dark matter halos @xcite .",
    "methods of determining cluster mass include x - ray temperature @xcite , cluster velocity dispersion @xcite , frequency bias caused by the sunyaev - zeldovich effect @xcite and tangential shear caused by weak lensing @xcite .",

    "although weak lensing signal can be minimal in single clusters , it can be maximized by using stacked shear measurements , combining shear signal in bins of similar richness and redshift .",
    "we observed stacked weak lensing shear as well as cluster richness in the sloan digital sky survey stripe 82 co - add using a sample of galaxy clusters found using the voronoi tesselation method @xcite .",

    "we also conclude , from the closeness of the black and the red lines , that the weights code is highly effective at reproducing the photometric distribution from the spectroscopic distribution .",
    "therefore we finally chose to use the weighted distribution of spectroscopic redshifts ( the blue line from method ( iv ) in figure [ sigmacritplot ] ) to calculate @xmath128 .",
    "we produced a lookup table of values of @xmath117 using these spectroscopic redshifts and then had the fitting routine refer to this table when finding @xmath117 for a particular cluster .",
    "the scale factor ( equation [ scaleslifted ] ) was then calculated as : @xmath139 @xmath140 was taken as @xmath141 @xmath142 , which is the value of @xmath84 found for @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "weak lensing shear was measured for a sample of galaxies that were more distant than each of the lensing clusters .",
    "we measured shear only for galaxies that were at a redshift that was 0.1 greater than cluster redshift .",
    "the redshifts used for these cuts are photometric redshifts , and thus they have larger errors than if they were spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "these errors can allow some galaxies that are actually at lower redshift than the cluster ( i.e. , in front of the cluster ) to be included in the sample of background source galaxies .",
    "this would contaminate the shear signal with galaxies that can not exhibit shear .",
    "this is especially a problem nearby a galaxy cluster , as cluster galaxies can be misidentified as background galaxies .",
    "the contamination can be quantified by noting that average tangential shear ( @xmath145 ) in a particular richness bin is @xmath146 where _ real _ and _ fake _ refer to source galaxies and misidentified foreground galaxies respectively and @xmath135 means total number of galaxies found in that richness bin .",
    "we expect @xmath147 to sum to zero since this includes only shape noise and no actual shear .",
    "however , the @xmath148 term remains , and we need to find a correction factor @xmath149 to account for it .    what we want is to remove the @xmath148 term in the denominator .",
    "thus we need to multiply the measured @xmath145 by this term : @xmath150 but since we can not directly measure @xmath151 , we can instead measure a number density , @xmath152 , the number of galaxies per area per cluster .",
    "thus @xmath153 here @xmath154 is the number of galaxies measured per area per cluster at various radii around clusters ; this tells us about @xmath155 because it accounts for all apparently source galaxies found nearby clusters ( including misidentified cluster galaxies ) .",
    "the second term , @xmath156 , is the number of galaxies per area per cluster measured at random points ; that is , far enough away from the center of the cluster that the concentration of galaxies that marks a galaxy cluster does not affect the number density .",
    "number density @xmath152 is measured by finding the total number of galaxies per area per cluster in a given richness bin . to find this , we find the total number of source galaxies in bins of @xmath118 mpc of distance from the bcg in each richness and redshift bin .",
    "we then divide this number by the product of the area of an annulus at that increment of distance from the bcg and the number of clusters in that richness bin . in other words , we measure @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the total number of apparently source galaxies in that richness and redshift bin , @xmath159 is the area of the annulus and @xmath160 is the number of clusters in that bin .    when we first measured the number densities , we found that they all decreased with radius , even for the random points .",
    "this is unexpected behavior , as random points should overall have no dependence of number density on position .",
    "it was found that this behavior was due to the nature of stripe 82 as a thin strip of observations ( 2.5 degrees wide in declination ) . for clusters that were near the edge of the images the number of nearby galaxies that could be measured",
    "would be limited to those that appeared on the images .",
    "as the distance from the cluster center increased , the number of galaxies per area would drop , not due to an actual decrease but simply because we had progressed outside the available imaging region . to address this issue , we remeasured the number of source galaxies per area per cluster while rejecting any clusters for which a circle of radius @xmath161 mpc would be off the imaging area .",
    "we found that number density for random points in the sky is about the same as the number density in the region of a cluster but far away from the center . because of this we chose to use the number density in the region of clusters but far away as the reference point for our foreground corrections .",
    "as the number density approached a constant by @xmath162 mpc , we measured the random number density between @xmath163 mpc ( see figure [ faraway ] ) .    .",
    "the horizontal green line represents the median value of number density and the vertical red line represents the beginning radius at which the random number density was measured .",
    "[ faraway ] ]    we finally multiplied the average tangential shear ( @xmath145 ) by the @xmath149 at each radius .",
    "the values of @xmath149 usually ranged from about @xmath164 at the most to @xmath165 at the least .",
    "the corrections are applied for each radius bin ( of size @xmath118 mpc ) , but beyond the first several radius bins most corrections are close to 1 ( meaning no change ) .",
    "in order to find a mass - richness relation by using the weak lensing shear results , we fit a power relation to @xmath32 and @xmath5 values . in each case",
    "we found mass - richness relations for many richness bins in four separate cluster redshift bins , @xmath107 ( low - z ) , @xmath166 ( mid - z ) , @xmath167 ( high - z ) and @xmath131 ( all - z ) .",
    "note that as mentioned in section [ one ] , all mass - richness relations are given in the form : @xmath168 where @xmath7 is the slope of the power law .",
    "this parameter tells us how quickly mass increases with an increase in richness .",
    "@xmath6 is the mass coefficient ; we define this to be the value of @xmath32 when @xmath169 .",
    "our initial mass - richness relations for the stripe 82 co - add were found with no corrections for the systematics discussed in section [ five ] .",
    "we then also found the mass - richness relations for the stripe 82 co - add including corrections for all of the above systematics .",
    "we corrected for the bias in the photometric redshifts .",
    "we excluded the central @xmath118 mpc in the fits , using only source galaxies between @xmath170 mpc from the bcg .",
    "we included the correction for halo miscentering .",
    "we also used the spectroscopic redshift lookup table to find values for @xmath84 and we applied the foreground galaxy correction factors when calculating @xmath145 . our final plot of mass vs. richness is shown in figure [ mass_rich_6 ] and the final numerical values for the mass - richness relations are shown in table [ massrich1 ] .",
    "we note that the errors are smallest for the low - z and all - z bins , while they are largest for the high - z bin .",
    ".mass - richness relation fit parameters for the stripe 82 co - add .",
    "mass coefficients all have the units @xmath171 .",

    "the dotted red line is the fit for all redshift bins ( all - z ) and is included for comparison in each case . ]",
    "finally we present all mass - richness relations found including all systematics for ( 1 ) low - z , ( 2 ) mid - z , ( 3 ) high - z and ( 4 ) all - z : @xmath172        in figure [ compareallvalues ] we compare all of the values of the mass coefficient and the power law slope from table [ massrich1 ] .",
    "mass coefficient +      +    power law slope +      +    the situations in these plots are : ( 1 ) no corrections ; ( 2 ) photo - z bias correction ; ( 3 ) central bcg correction ; ( 4 ) halo miscentering correction ; ( 5 ) photo - z uncertainty correction ; ( 6 ) foreground galaxy correction ; and ( 7 ) all corrections .",
    "the correction that typically has the most significant effect on the mass coefficient and the power law slope is the correction for halo miscentering .",
    "mass coefficient also changes significantly when the five corrections are all applied together .      directly comparing mass coefficients and power law slopes to other groups",
    "is difficult because other samples have a number of elements that make them different .",
    "our measurements are different from those of @xcite and @xcite because they use the richness measure @xmath30 while we use @xmath5 .",
    "the voronoi tessellation cluster sample will have different properties than the maxbcg sample used by these groups as the former is independent of galaxy color while the latter relies on it .",
    "similarly the 3d - matched - filter ( 3d - mf ) cluster - finding algorithm used by @xcite and @xcite is independent of galaxy color , but its method of searching for galaxy clusters based on a fiducial luminosity profile will produce a sample with different properties than the vt cluster finder .",
    "for example , the 3d - mf cluster finder produces a cluster sample with a much larger richness range than the vt cluster finder .",
    "@xcite discuss the fact that their mass coefficient is quite low compared to other measurements ; they consider this to be because their cluster finder locates more low - mass clusters than other cluster finders or because it detects more faint galaxies , leading to higher richness values .",
    "@xcite use the same sample as @xcite but they define @xmath32 based on @xmath173 ( mean density of the universe ) rather than @xmath174 ( critical density of the universe ) .",
    "( @xcite and @xcite use critical density in their definitions of @xmath32 . ) .",
    "since mean density is slightly larger than critical density , we expect that the mass values found by reyes would be slightly larger ; @xcite predict that mass values found using mean density will be @xmath175 higher .",
    "since @xcite give a mass coefficient of @xmath176 and @xcite give one of @xmath177 ( @xmath178 difference ) , these values approximately follow the expected trend .    in order to make an approximate comparison , we use equation [ convertnvt ] to find that when @xmath34 , @xmath179 .",
    "thus we find mass coefficients at @xmath179 , approximating that these correspond to @xmath34 .",
    "for the low - z bin we find @xmath180 .",
    "this is smaller than the previous measurements , including @xmath181 from johnston et al .",
    ", @xmath182 from simet et al and @xmath183 from reyes et al . for the mid - z bin we found @xmath184 . in this approximate redshift range @xcite and found the significantly smaller values of @xmath185 or @xmath186 .",
    "however , as mentioned above , @xcite note that their values of mass coefficient are lower than others .",
    "if we directly compare our values of power law slope to those of other groups , we find that our value for the redshift @xmath107 bin of @xmath12 is close to the values found by @xcite and @xcite of @xmath187 and @xmath188 .",
    "it is farther from the value of @xcite of @xmath189 .",
    "our values of power law slope for the redshift @xmath131 bin of @xmath15 are lower than those found by @xcite and @xcite , which were @xmath190 and @xmath191 .",
    "to examine the evolution of the mass - richness relation , we considered the mass coefficient and the power law slope as a function of redshift . in figure",
    "[ massred ] we plot the mass coefficient and the power law slope vs. redshift for three redshift bins : low - z ( @xmath192 ) , mid - z ( @xmath193 ) and high - z ( @xmath194 ) .     as a function of redshift ( upper plot ) and the power law slope as a function of redshift ( lower plot ) for the stripe 82 co - add .",

    "the green lines are the linear best - fitting relations , with their respective equations displayed at the top of each plot .",
    "[ massred ] ]    we then found linear relations between mass coefficient ( @xmath195 ) and z and power law slope , ( @xmath7 ) and z as : @xmath196 figure [ massred ] suggests that there is strong evidence of redshift evolution in the mass coefficient .",
    "the high - z point has large error bars , but the low - z and mid - z points have smaller error bars and also give evidence of redshift evolution , leading the overall error on the slope of the mass coefficient - redshift relation ( equation [ yesme ] ) to be less than @xmath197 of the slope .",
    "our finding here disagrees with the finding of @xcite : figure 8 in @xcite shows the opposite trend , of an overall decrease in mass coefficient with redshift .",
    "however their error bars are large and they state that their negative slope is consistent with zero .",
    "we find here that redshift evolution of the power law slope is less clear .",
    "while there is some evidence of redshift evolution of the power law slope , the error on the slope of the second relation in equation [ yesme ] is about @xmath175 .    in figure",
    "[ massred ] it does appear that there is redshift evolution of the mass coefficient and there may be redshift evolution of the power law slope .",
    "this would suggest that clusters of the same richness are more massive at higher redshift and that at higher redshift , cluster mass increases faster with increasing richness",
    ". this would be consistent with the idea that dark matter haloes associated with galaxy clusters contain more dark matter at higher redshift .",
    "however it is important to note that there is a difference between real mass evolution with redshift and apparent mass evolution caused by measurement systematics .",
    "one particular systematic that might cause the appearance of redshift evolution is the limiting magnitude for cluster finding .",
    "the voronoi tessellation method uses an apparent magnitude cut rather than an absolute magnitude cut .",
    "this means that the sample of clusters will be less complete at higher redshift , where galaxies will be biased toward dimmer apparent magnitude simply because of their large distances . in our sample there are more clusters found at higher redshift than at lower redshift because there is a larger volume sampled at higher redshift .",
    "however at increasing redshift , we expect the detection completeness of the cluster sample to decrease .",
    "thus there would be poorer statistics at higher redshift , which could bias the ultimate measurement of mass coefficient at higher - z . in",
    "order to further test this mass - redshift relation , it would be better to also find this relation using a cluster sample that is limited by absolute magnitude rather than apparent magnitude .",
    "we present mass - richness relations for the sloan digital sky survey stripe 82 co - add .",
    "these mass - richness relations are presented for four redshift bins , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "we present a sample of galaxy clusters and we describe how these clusters were found using a voronoi tessellation cluster finder ; cluster richness is given in terms of a richness measure we call @xmath5",
    ". our sample includes @xmath198 clusters in stripe 82 between @xmath199 and @xmath60 .",
    "we describe how we measured stacked weak lensing shear in a sequence of redshift and richness bins .",
    "we found values for @xmath32 by fitting measured shear to an nfw model .",
    "we describe tests conducted to verify the strength of the weak lensing signal ; these included measurements of orthotangential shear for all cluster bins and measurements of weak lensing shear around random points .",
    "we also describe the effects of systematics on weak lensing shear and thus cluster mass ( @xmath32 ) results .",
    "these systematics include a bias in photometric redshifts , the effect of the central bcg , halo miscentering , photometric redshift uncertainty and foreground galaxy contamination .",
    "we present methods to correct for each of these systematics while measuring @xmath32 .",
    "we find that the halo miscentering correction has the largest effect on mass measurements while the other corrections have smaller effects .",
    "we present values for the mass coefficient and the power law slope for mass - richness relations found using power law fits to stripe 82 data for each of the four redshift bins .",
    "after considering all corrections we find values of the mass coefficient ( @xmath6 ) of @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 for each of the four redshift bins respectively .",
    "we find values of the power law slope ( @xmath7 ) of @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively .",
    "we also considered mass evolution of the mass - richness relation .",
    "we conclude that there is good evidence of redshift evolution of the mass coefficient and less clear evidence of redshift evolution of the power law slope .",
