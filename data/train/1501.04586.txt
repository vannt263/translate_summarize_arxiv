    "the poincar group provides the fundamental kinematic symmetry of a relativistic particle . as a non - compact group ,",
    "all its unitary representations are infinite dimensional , but in a famous paper @xcite wigner showed that the physically interesting representations can be induced from finite - dimensional unitary representations of a _ little group _ , which is the subgroup of homogeneous lorentz transformations that leaves some reference four - momentum @xmath1 invariant .",
    "the representation space of the little group is the hilbert space for the particle s spin .",
    "if the particle has positive mass @xmath2 , we may take as reference the four - momentum in the particle s rest frame where @xmath3 .",
    "the little group then consists of the space rotations @xmath4 . for a massless particle",
    "there is no rest frame and the reference momentum must be a null vector @xmath5 .",
    "the little group now consists of space rotations @xmath6 about the three - vector @xmath7 , together with operations that are generated by infinitesimal lorentz boosts in directions perpendicular to @xmath7 combined with compensating infinitesimal rotations .",
    "remarkably the combined operations mutually commute , possess all the algebraic properties of euclidean translations , and the resulting little group is isomorphic to the symmetry group @xmath0 of the two - dimensional euclidean plane .",
    "what is being moved by these translation operations ?",
    "the answer given by wigner is that they move : if the translation generators had a physical effect , the little - group representation would be infinite dimensional and the particle being described would have `` continuous spin ''  a property possessed by no known particle .",
    "indeed the wigner translations have no effect when applied to plane - wave solutions of the massless dirac equation , and act as gauge transformations when applied to the vector potentials of plane - wave solutions of maxwell s equations @xcite .",
    "consequently they act as the identity on the momentum eigenstates created by the operator - valued coefficients of the plane - wave modes , thus ensuring that the spin of a massless particle is entirely specified by a finite - dimensional representation of the @xmath8 helicity subgroup @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to show that , while they have no effect on _ infinite _ plane waves , when applied to _ finite - size _ wave packets of non - zero helicity  and in particular to circularly polarized gaussian packets  the wigner translations do have an effect : they shift the wave packet trajectory parallel to itself .",
    "this shift is related to the relativistic hall effect of light @xcite and to the observer dependence of the location of massless particles @xcite .",
    "it gives rise to the unusual lorentz covariance properties found @xcite in the chiral kinetic theory approach to anomalous conservation laws @xcite and is also the source of the difficulty of obtaining a conventionally covariant classical mechanics for a massless spinning particle in a gravitational field @xcite .",
    "in section [ sec : poincare ] we will provide a suggestive algebraic argument for a sideways shift .",
    "in section [ sec : paraxial ] we will show that the shift actually occurs in finite - width beam solutions to maxwell s equations . in section [ sec : discussion ]",
    "we will discuss and resolve a potential paradox implied by the trajectory displacement .",
    "as an indication that wigner translations can have a physical effect , we briefly review a well - known @xcite realization of the poincar algebra for massless particles of helicity @xmath9 in terms of quantum mechanical position and momentum operators .",
    "we start from the familiar commutators [ x_i , p_j]=i _ ij , = 0 , [ eq : canonical ] and use the fact that the spin of a massless particle is slaved to its direction of motion to motivate the definition of the angular momentum operator as j_k= _ klm x_lp_m + .",
    "[ eq : qm - ang - mom ] this unconventional definition preserves the usual commutation relation = i _ klm p_m .",
    "however , in order to recover [ j_k , x_l]= i _ klm x_m , and [ j_k , j_l]= i _",
    "klm j_m , we need to modify the commutator of the position - operator components to [ x_k , x_l]= -i _ klm . accepting that the position - operator components no longer commute , we can still use @xmath10 to define a generator of lorentz boosts in direction @xmath11 as k_k=12(x_k|| + ||x_k ) .",
    "these generators satisfy the remaining relations of the lorentz lie algebra [ j_k , k_l]&= & i_klm k_m , + [ k_k , k_l]&= & -i_klm j_m , [ eq : lorentz ] and act as expected on the momentum components : [ k_k,||]&=&i p_k , + [ k_k , p_l]&=&i_kl|| .",
    "[ eq : p - boost ] we have therefore constructed a representation of the poincar algebra on a quantum - mechanical hilbert space .",
    "when we extend the algebra to include the position operators , things become more complicated .",
    "we find ( at @xmath12 ) [ k_k , x_l]=-i\\ { 12(x_k + x_k ) + _ klm } .",
    "[ eq : x - boost ] neither term is immediately familiar .",
    "the expression in parentheses arises because the underlying hamiltonian formalism automatically maintains the non - lorentz invariant condition @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the term containing the helicity @xmath9 will be more interesting .",
    "we select a reference four - momentum @xmath14 where @xmath15 and obtain the corresponding wigner translation generators as the boosts and compensating rotations given by _ 1&=&k_1 + j_2 , + _ 2&=&k_2-j_1 .",
    "[ eq : wigner ] from ( [ eq : lorentz ] ) we see that these generators obey the @xmath0 lie algebra [ _ 1,_2]=0 , = i_2 , = -i_1 .",
    "from ( [ eq : p - boost ] ) and ( [ eq : x - boost ] ) we also see that @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and the @xmath0 generators collectively leave invariant the eigenspace with eigenvalues @xmath18 and any fixed @xmath19 .",

    "is this apparent displacement merely an artifact of an unconventional representation of the poincar algebra , or does it have something to do with physics ?    in the next section we will use solutions of maxwell s equations to illustrate that this sideways shift is not just a mathematical curiosity , but corresponds to what occurs in nature  the trajectory of a circularly polarized photon is observer - dependent and is translated parallel to itself by an infinitesimal lorentz boost and aberration - compensating rotation .",

    "the wavefronts are therefore tilted .",
    "the beam envelope , however , still lies parallel to the @xmath29-axis , and is moving towards the observer at speed @xmath62 ( see figure [ fig : fig1]-b ) .",
    "the lorentz transformation also affects the energy density distribution and the poynting - vector flux though the @xmath51 plane .",
    "in addition to a lorentz contraction it noticeably shifts the position of their maxima ( see figure [ fig : fig2 ] ) . to quantify these shifts we can compute the location of the lorentz transformed energy density and energy flux centroids .",

    "the centroids do not coincide , the energy - flux centroid moving only half as far as the energy - density centroid .",
    "such displacements are not restricted to gaussian beams .",
    "a similar boost - induced sideways shift and centroid separation was exhibited in @xcite for bessel beams possessing orbital angular momentum .",
    "it was also explained there that the centroid separation arises solely from the geometrical effect pointed out in @xcite : because of their corkscrew trajectories , energy - flux streamlines passing through a surface rotated away from perpendicular to the direction of propagation find themselves inclined at different angles to the surface to the right and left of the plane of rotation .",
    "consequently , even in the absence of a lorentz boost , the energy - flux centroid of a tilted beam is displaced with respect to its energy - density centroid @xcite .",
    "we wish to obtain a finite - displacement version of the wigner translations , so , after performing the boost , we rotate the lorentz transformed beam about @xmath63 though an aberration - compensating angle of @xmath64 . after the rotation",
    "the wavevector becomes @xmath65 and the wavefronts again lie parallel to the @xmath66-@xmath67 plane .",

    "how it changes is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]-c .",
    "we see that the transformed beam can be though of as a sequence of pulses each fired in the @xmath27 direction by an emitter that is moving rapidly to the left .",

    "any particular packet continues to move parallel to the @xmath29 axis , but as a result of the lateral shift in the @xmath51 plane , its entire trajectory is shifted sideways by @xmath80 .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig1]-c also shows why the action of the wigner translations take their simple form ( [ eq : wigner - subspace ] ) only in the plane @xmath81 . in any other plane",

    "the finite-@xmath58 boosts considered in this section have effects on the photon energy and intensity that appear at quadratic order in the rapidity @xmath58 .",
    "if we alternate a sequence of infinitesimal boosts and compensating rotations , the quadratic terms can be neglected and only the sideways shift ( now equal to @xmath82 times the total rapidity change ) remains .",
    "we are in effect assembling a trotter - product approximation that converges to exponentials of the wigner translation generators ( [ eq : wigner ] ) .",
    "the direction and magnitude of the boost - induced lateral shift can be understood from a geometric picture ( see @xcite for a related argument ) .",
    "consider two massless particles , both possessing helicity @xmath83 and heading directly towards one another parallel to the @xmath66 axis .",

    "seen from a frame moving along the @xmath67 axis towards the collision point , however , the unit vectors in the direction of the particles motion have components @xmath85 . because the spin of a massless particle is slaved to its direction of motion",
    "there is now a net spin component of @xmath86 directed towards the observer . nonetheless , in the new frame",

    "this orbital angular momentum can only come from a lateral shift of each particle s trajectory by @xmath88 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : collision ] ) . for a photon @xmath89 and @xmath90 , so we recover the shift seen in our gaussian beam .",

    "the sideways shift can not affect the pion production .",
