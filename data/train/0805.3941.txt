    "the cosmological constant problem has acquired a renewed importance since several independent observations have been pointing to the presence of a negative pressure component in the cosmic fluid  @xcite . in view of quantum field theories , the natural candidate for such",
    "a dark energy is the quantum vacuum energy .",
    "since it has the symmetry of the background , its energy - momentum tensor has the form @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a scalar function of coordinates .",
    "this leads to the equation of state @xmath5 , where @xmath4 may be a function of time ( @xmath6 ) in general . in the case of a constant @xmath4",
    ", the vacuum contribution plays the role of a cosmological constant in einstein s equations . the model based on a constant @xmath7 and a variable @xmath8",
    "is called the @xmath7cdm model and @xmath8cdm model , respectively .",
    "the idea of a time - dependent cosmological term has provided different phenomenological implementations  @xcite , being a subject of renewed interest in recent years  @xcite .",
    "a general feature of all those approaches is the production of a new kind of matter , compatible with the vacuum decay in order to assure the conservation of the total energy - momentum  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , there exists dynamical cosmological constants derived from the holographic principle .",
    "et al _ have shown that in quantum field theory , the uv cutoff @xmath9 is related to the ir cutoff @xmath10 due to the limit set by forming a black hole  @xcite .",
    "in other words , if @xmath11 is the quantum vacuum energy density caused by the uv cutoff , the total energy of system with size @xmath10 should not exceed the mass of the system - size black hole : @xmath12 . if the largest size @xmath13 is chosen to be the one saturating this bound , the holographic energy density is then given by @xmath14 with a parameter @xmath15  @xcite , in contrast with the conventional energy density of @xmath16 .",
    "we consider @xmath17 as the dynamical cosmological constant .    also , we have two different views of determining the equation of state for the holographic energy density .",
    "the first view is that its native equation of state is not changing as the universe evolves  @xcite .",
    "it is fixed by @xmath18 initially . an important point to note",
    "is that the holographic energy density itself is changing as a result of decaying into the cdm .",
    "according to the total energy - momentum conservation , its change must be compensated by the corresponding change in the cdm sector  @xcite .",
    "the second view is that the equation of state for the holographic energy density is not fixed in general , but it is changing as the universe expands with / without the interaction  @xcite . if an interaction is present between two matters , one would be better to use the effective equation of state @xmath19  @xcite than the native equation of state @xmath20  @xcite . in the presence of an interaction , the first view leads to a constant eos @xmath19 , while the second view implies a dynamical eos @xmath21 with density parameter @xmath22 .    in this work",
    ", we investigate the vacuum decaying of holographic energy density with the ir cutoff using the first view of the constant eos .",
    "the key of our system is an interaction between holographic energy and cdm .",
    "they are changing as a result of energy transfer from holographic energy to the cdm .",
    "we call this the h(@xmath23)cdm model , similar to the @xmath8cdm model  @xcite",
    ". specifically , we present small perturbations under the case of a new matter production with @xmath24 . in general , such a matter production may tend to dilute the matter contrast . for a decelerating universe of @xmath25 ,",
    "the matter contrast is growing as the universe evolves , while for an accelerating universe of @xmath26 , the matter contrast is decaying , irrespective of the choice of ir cutoff .",
    "this shows the connection between the background evolution and matter contrast clearly .",
    "for a flat universe composed of cold dark matter and holographic energy density  @xcite , the first friedmann equation is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the reduced planck mass , and the holographic dark energy takes the form @xmath30 the conservation law of the total energy - momentum leads to @xmath31 where the overdot(@xmath32 ) denotes the derivative with respect to the cosmic time @xmath23 . here",
    "@xmath33 and @xmath34 with @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",

    ", the conservation law is split into two equations @xmath38 for a choice of the interaction @xmath39  @xcite , the solution to the above equations is given by @xmath40 then , we obtain an explicit form of the solution : @xmath41^{\\frac{2}{3-\\epsilon}},~h= \\frac{\\dot{a}}{a } = \\frac{2}{3-\\epsilon}\\frac{1}{t}.\\ ] ] their energy densities take the forms @xmath42 \\frac{1}{t^2},~\\rho_\\lambda=\\left[\\frac{4 m_p^2 \\epsilon}{(3-\\epsilon)^2}\\right ] \\frac{1}{t^2}.\\ ] ] finally , the constant effective eos could be read off from eq.([den ] ) as @xmath43 which depends on the choice of ir cutoff . as will be shown in fig .",
    "3 , @xmath44 depends critically on the choice of ir cutoff @xmath10 .    on the other hand , the newtonian equation governing the evolution of density perturbations of cdm  @xcite",
    "can be generalized in order to account for matter production .",

    "in the case of a constant @xmath48 , ( [ waga ] ) reduces to the usual non - relativistic equation for the linear evolution of the matter contrast .",
    "that is , it corresponds to the matter contrast of the @xmath7cdm model . in our case of the h(@xmath23)cdm model , we have @xmath49 .",

    "the density parameter @xmath58 satisfies the background evolution equation , @xmath59 while the first friedmann equation ( [ ffeq ] ) is @xmath60 .",
    "the solution to this equation is given by @xmath61 where the numerical factor @xmath62 is chosen to fit the present condition of @xmath63 and @xmath64 .    if there is no cosmological constant term , then eq.([evol_pert ] )",
    "becomes @xmath65 which describes the matter contrast of the standard cold dark matter ( scdm ) with @xmath66 .",
    "the solution for this equation is given by @xmath67 with two constants @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "obviously , the first term is a growing mode and the latter is a decaying one .",
    "this could be easily conjectured because of the purely decelerating phase of the cdm .",
    "on the other hand , the general solution of @xmath4cdm to eq.([evol_pert ] ) is given by @xmath70 where @xmath58 is given by eq.([omega_lambda ] ) .",
    "the connection to the redshift @xmath71 is given by @xmath72 with @xmath73 .",

    "this is possible because the early universe is the cdm - dominated phase .",
    "however , as is shown in fig .",
    "1 , the growing rates for scdm and @xmath4cdm are different . the growing rate for scdm is greater than that of @xmath4cdm since the cdm - nature of @xmath4cdm decreases as the universe evolves ( the universe becomes the dark energy - dominated phase ) .",

    ", the new matter tends to dilute the density perturbations , leading to a suppression of the density contrast . plugging @xmath79 into eq.([denseq ] ) , the newtonian equation for matter contrast is @xmath88 \\frac{\\dot{\\delta}}{t } -\\left [ \\frac{2}{3 ( 1-c^2)}-\\frac{8 c^2}{3 ( 1-c^2)^2 } + \\frac{2 c^2}{(1-c^2)}\\right]\\frac{\\delta}{t^2}=0\\ ] ] in order to solve the above equation , we assume that @xmath89",

    "2 shows that @xmath76 is positive , zero , and negative for @xmath91 , respectively , while @xmath92 is always negative .",
    "hence we find a growing mode of the matter contrast only for @xmath93 .",

    "all of @xmath110 belong to decaying modes .",
    "this is consistent with our conjecture . at this stage",
    ", we point out that the region of @xmath111 with the future event horizon may lead to the phantom phase ( see fig .",
    "however , the newtonian equations for matter contrast do not work for @xmath111 .",
    "hence we could not discuss the evolution of density perturbation in the background of phantom phase .    ) cdm with future event horizon ( fh ) .",
    "the left panel denotes the exponents @xmath75 and the right one denotes the matter contrasts for @xmath76 of decaying modes with different @xmath112 . in the left panel",
