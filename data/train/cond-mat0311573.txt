    "the fowler  nordheim ( f  n ) theory  @xcite is one of the most important theories of electron field emission .",
    "it describes experiments , i.e. , current  voltage characteristics of field emission current  @xcite and energy distribution of field emitted electrons,@xcite quite well . it should be noted , however , that the surface of emitter is assumed to be _ planar _ in their model  @xcite although actual emitters are _ not planar _ literally , and the famous f ",
    "n formula @xmath0 , for example , is derived under this assumption .",
    "this assumption may be considered to be justified since the emission area on the surface of emitter may be limited to a so small region at the apex of the emitter that the area can be regarded as planar .",
    "there is however no rigorous verification of this expectation .",
    "furthermore , emitters are becoming sharper and sharper nowadays , e.g. , nanotip , nanotube , etc .",
    ", for which the planar emitter model is inappropriate .",
    "it is hence worthwhile to see how the field emission formulae are modified when the ( three dimensional ) geometry of emitter is taken into account .",
    "attempts to incorporate geometrical effects into the f ",
    "n theory have already been made by several groups.@xcite he _",
    "et  al . _",
    "derived bias fields and image charge potentials exactly for the tips shaped like cone , hyperboloid , paraboloid , and sphere on cone,@xcite and discussed the effect of the geometry of the emitters on field emission:@xcite they numerically obtained ( i )  field emission currents from the apex of those emitters and ( ii )  ( normal ) energy distributions of emitted electrons , and they concluded that ( i )  the current  voltage characteristics for the nonplanar ( and rather sharp ) emitters can be fitted with the relationship @xmath1 , which is different from the one by the f ",
    "n model , @xmath0 , and that ( ii )  the energy distributions for the nonplanar models are much wider than that for the f ",
    "n planar model .",
    "in this article , we successfully derive _ analytical formulae _ for current  voltage characteristics and energy distribution for a _ hyperboloidal _ emitter model ( although the image charge effect is neglected ) .",
    "even though our formulae are valid only for conventional emitters whose tip radii of curvature are of the order of @xmath2 , they still reflect the geometry of the emitter and the traditional f  n formulae are modified .",
    "furthermore , our analytical calculation enables us to discuss the assumption of the planar emitter in the f ",
    "n model , and also helps us understand the backgrounds of the above - mentioned numerical discussion by he _",
    "et  al . _ and",
    "at the final part of this article , experimental data of field emissions from nanotip emitters  @xcite are analyzed by making use of a parameter , which characterizes the sharpness of the hyperboloidal emitter and never comes in the ordinary f ",
    "n theory based on the planar emitter model .",
    ", @xmath3 , and @xmath4 ( tungsten ) .",
    "the work function of the emitter , @xmath5 , is assumed to be uniform.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    our model is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] .",
    "it is composed of a hyperboloidal metallic emitter and a planar collector .",
    "the work function of the emitter , @xmath5 , is assumed to be uniform on the surface of the emitter .",
    "it is implicitly assumed in the ordinary f ",
    "n theory  @xcite that the emission area on the surface of the emitter , from which electrons are emitted , is limited to a very small region at the apex of the emitter and can be regarded as planar .",
    "the surface of the emitter is thus modelled by a plane , and tunnelling of electrons through a one - dimensional potential barrier at the surface is discussed . in this article , on the contrary , we duly take the shape of the emitter into account and proceed without such an assumption .",
    "the size of the emission area is also what is to be clarified as a result of the following calculation .",
    "we work in an orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system , i.e. , an ellipsoidal coordinate system @xmath6 [ fig .  [ fig : coordinate](a ) ] .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : r - v ]    although the radius of curvature @xmath7 should be independent of the applied voltage @xmath8 , of course , the estimated value decreases slightly with @xmath8 .",
    "this is due to the image charge effect .",
    "this effect is neglected in our formulation , and the enhancement of the emission current due to it is renormalized into the parameter @xmath9 , i.e. , into the sharpness of the emitter . the enhancement is a slowly increasing function of @xmath8 as already mentioned in the previous section , and the estimated radius of curvature of the emitter accordingly decreases with @xmath8 .",
    "one hence has to be careful about the fact that the image charge effect is included in the parameter @xmath9 .",
    "in this article , we have derived field emission formulae from a _ hyperboloidal _ emitter model , i.e. , current  voltage characteristics  ( [ eqn : currentdim ] ) ,  ( [ eqn : currentasymp ] ) , and  ( [ eqn : i - v ] ) , and energy distribution of emitted electrons  ( [ eqn : energydistributiondim ] ) and  ( [ eqn : energydistributionasymp ] ) , which are valid under the condition  ( [ eqn : parameterregion ] ) . reflecting the geometry of the emitter , the traditional f  n",
    "formulae , which are derived based on the _ planar _ emitter model , are modified .",
    "the current  voltage characteristics in the f ",
    "n theory , @xmath0 , is replaced with @xmath10 , for example .",
    "the geometrical effect manifests itself in the exponent of @xmath8 on the left - hand side .",
    "we have also addressed and reconsidered the assumption of the planar emitter in the f ",
    "an estimation of the spread of emission area based on the formula  ( [ eqn : solidangle ] ) shows that the area can not be regarded as planar even for a conventional emitter .",
    "furthermore , our analytical calculation has revealed the backgrounds of the conclusions drawn by he _",
    "et  al._,@xcite which are based on a numerical calculation : the origin of the correction term in their current  voltage characteristics has been clarified , and the dependence of the width of energy distribution on radius of curvature of emitter has been explained . the concise formula  ( [ eqn : width ] ) for the width of energy distribution might be useful in practical experiments .    and finally , we have attempted to analyze experimental data of nanotip emitters  @xcite by making use of the parameter @xmath9 , which characterizes the sharpness of the emitters , and clarified an effect of a nanotip fabricated on top of a normal clean emitter : the effective radius of curvature of the emitter is considerably reduced .",
    "one should note , however , that our formulae do not explain the characteristics peculiar to nanotip emitters exactly",
    ". actually , energy distributions for nanotip emitters,@xcite for example , can not be fitted by our formula  ( [ eqn : energydistributiondim ] ) and  ( [ eqn : energydistributionasymp ] ) .",
    "one of the reasons for this is that electrons can not be treated as localized objects in nanotips , whose radii of curvature are of the order of @xmath11 . for a rigorous description of field emission from today s nanoscale tips ,",
    "a fully quantum treatment is required.@xcite                                    one may consider that our formula  ( [ eqn : i - v ] ) should coincide with the conventional f ",
    "n formula in the limit @xmath15 .",
    "it is not the case , however , because the expansion of the action @xmath16 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : action ] ) is valid only when the emission area is finite , but the area is infinite for conventional planar emitter model .",
    "the new formula  ( [ eqn : i - v ] ) , which is derived with this expansion , therefore , can not be reduced to the conventional one even if the radius of curvature @xmath7 is taken to infinity .",
    "it is easy to understand the sign of @xmath17 , i.e. , positivity of @xmath18 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : correctedaction ] ) , since @xmath19 correction to the bias field potential @xmath20 is always positive and gives rise to a positive correction to the action @xmath21 ."
