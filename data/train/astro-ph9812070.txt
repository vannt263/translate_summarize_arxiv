    "near infrared ( 15 ) spectroscopic classification schemes have recently been outlined for ob stars ( hanson et al .",
    "1996 , hereafter hcr96 ; blum et al . 1997 ) and wolf  rayet ( wr ) stars ( e.g. , eenens et al .",
    "1991 ; figer et al .",
    "1997 ) . coupled with infrared spectrometers on large telescopes",
    ", these classification schemes are now pushing forward the exploration of optically obscured , young stellar populations throughout the inner galaxy . indeed , hanson et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have presented a detailed investigation of the ionizing o and b stars in m17 , a relatively nearby but partially obscured giant hii region .",
    "in addition , the central 50 pc of the milky way have been intensely studied with the application of near infrared spectroscopy .",
    "it has been revealed that the stellar cluster in the central parsec , as well as two other nearby clusters , are rich in ob and wolf  rayet stars ( see morris & serabyn 1996 for a recent review and the many references therein ) .",
    "massey et al . (",
    "1995 ) have produced a detailed characterization of the stellar mass function in optically visible ob associations in the milky way .",
    "their fundamental work serves as a benchmark comparison of galactic ob star properties relative to other environments ( e.g. , the magellanic clouds ) .",
    "the present project , in which this paper is a beginning , will build on massey et al.s work by investigating the optically obscured stellar content of the inner galaxy giant h  ii regions through infrared photometry and spectroscopy .",
    "these observations will probe and compare the mass function as a function of galacto  centric position , provide checks on galactic structure ( spiral arm morphology ) through spectroscopic distance estimates which can be compared to radio recombination line / rotation model distances , and investigate massive star formation phenomena .",
    "the latter aspect is particularly exciting as many of the optically obscured giant h  ii regions are young enough that we expect to find multiple epochs of star formation , i.e. , young stellar objects ( ysos ) in the presence of more evolved ob and wr stars .",
    "this is already in evidence in m  17 where it appears that while the hottest o stars have little or no infrared excess ( having `` blown '' away their birth cocoons ) , the somewhat less massive later type o and b stars show evidence for discs still surrounding them ( hanson et al .",
    "these two groups are spatially segregated in m  17 .",
    "are the early o stars more efficient at removing their circumstellar material through strong winds and radiation , or do the two groups represent star formation at different epochs in m  17 ?",
    "investigations of other giant h  ii regions will help answer such fundamental questions about massive star formation .",
    "w43 ( = g30.8 - 0.2 ) is a giant h  ii region in the first galactic quadrant ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "its distance , from h  i line radio measurements and a galactic rotation model , is about 7 kpc ( smith et al .",
    "the entire region emits about @xmath4 lyman continuum photons per sec (= lyc ) according to these authors .",
    "this is equivalent to roughly 100 `` o7 star equivalents '' ( vacca 1994 ) , similar to ngc  3603 and a factor of a few smaller than r136 .",
    "w43 contains about @xmath5 solar masses of molecular gas , a quantity which suggests ongoing star formation ( liszt 1995 ) .",
    "w43 has been observed by liszt et al .",
    "( 1993 ) with the very large array ( vla ) : they provide a 9@xmath6 scale map in the radio l band continuum synthesized from the h  i absorption measures .",
    "the overall spatial morphology of the emission is roughly that of a `` t''with a sagging `` wing '' to the west .",
    "subrahmanyan & goss ( 1996 ) present an 80@xmath7 vla map of the entire w43 complex at 330 mhz ; a number of other sources are indicated , but g30.8 - 0.2 dominates the radio emission .",
    "liszt et al . (",
    "1993 ) call the position of the strongest source g30.780.23 ; this is the top bar of the `` t '' .",
    "this source is called g30.8n in the far infrared maps of lester et al . ( 1985 ) .",
    "the bottom of the `` t '' , also seen in the far infrared maps , is denoted g30.8s by lester et al .",
    "( 1985 ) . the stellar cluster , which will be the main topic of this paper , lies between g30.8n and g30.8s and was first seen as an unresolved @xmath1band source by lester et al .",
    "( 1985 ) .",
    "using @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath1band photometry , we reveal this stellar source as a massive cluster of newly formed stars .",
    "three of the most luminous stars in the cluster are identified and classified as hot stars .",
    "w43 is totally obscured optically ; we estimate ( below ) that @xmath10 is about 30 mag .",
    "high angular resolution @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath11 images of w43 were obtained on the nights of 28 and 29 august 1998 with the f/14 tip  tilt system on the cerro tololo interamerican observatory ( ctio ) 4 m blanco telescope using the facility imager ( cirim ) .",

    "the daophot errors ranged from approximately @xmath17 0.01 mag to an arbitrary cut  off of 0.5 mag ( stars with larger errors were excluded from further analysis ) .",

    "br@xmath20 absorption in hd7209 was removed by eye by drawing a line across it between two continuum points .",
    "one dimensional spectra were obtained by extracting and summing the flux in a @xmath17 2 pixel aperture .",
    "the wavelength calibration was accomplished by measuring the positions of six bright oh@xmath21 lines from the @xmath1band sky spectrum ( oliva & origlia 1992 ) . because the grating was moved when acquiring objects , the zero point of the solution is good only to a few pixels ; lines are identified by their relative difference between one and another .",

    "1996 , o3b0 ; schmidt - kaler 1982 , b1b9 ) assuming a distance of 7 kpc (  1 ) .",
    "figure  [ cc ] shows a @xmath24 vs. @xmath23 color  color plot of the stars on the high resolution cirim images .",
    "this diagram indicates a large range in extinction and reddening in the field ( 0 4.5 mag for stars detected at @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath11 ) .",
    "the _ dashed _ lines in this plot represent reddening lines due to interstellar extinction based on the average relation given in mathis ( 1990 ) .",
    "each of the two lines begins at the colors for an unreddened star ( m3 iii , frogel et al .",
    "1978 ; o6 , koornneef 1983 ) .",
    "the lines describe an envelope of reddened colors for a nearby `` disk '' population with the above mean colors . from figure  [ cmd ] , it is clear that the cluster sequence lies near @xmath23 @xmath25 2 mag .",
    "this corresponds to  of roughly 3.2 mag ( or @xmath26 @xmath19 34 mag ) .",
    "estimates of the  toward the spectroscopic targets are made in  3.2 where the spectroscopic clarification is used to determine the intrinsic colors of the stars .",
    "several objects on the color ",
    "color plot have a large excess emission indicated .",
    "such excesses are consistent with the objects being ysos with circumstellar material ( e.g. , a disk as indicated for a number of newly formed stars in m  17  hanson et al .",
    "1997 , though we have no evidence yet for any particular geometry giving rise to the putative excess emission in this case ) .",
    "there are also objects which appear extremely red in figure  [ cmd ] but which are not detected in @xmath8 .",
    "these may be seen through even larger columns of obscuring material .",
    "alternately , they may be intrinsically fainter at @xmath8 but have a larger excess at @xmath11 .",
    "these possibilities will be investigated with future spectroscopic observations .",
    "a @xmath0 color composite of the wide field of view cirim images ( 2.7@xmath27 ) is shown in figure  [ clr2 ] .",
    "this composite demonstrates that much of the scatter in figure  [ cmd ] ( especially in the cluster sequence ) can be attributed to differential reddening .",
    "the spatial scales involved can be quite small .",
    "for example , there is an obvious clump of obscuring material which appears in projection just arcseconds to the sw of the central cluster .",
    "along the upper edge of figure  [ clr2 ] nebulosity ( from br@xmath20 ) is present .",
    "this is the upper part of the `` t '' so obvious in the radio and far infrared images ( lester et al .",
    "1985 ; liszt et al . 1993 ) , and denoted by lester et al . as g30.8n .",
    "very red stars appear in projection against g30.8n in the color image .",
    "notice that in the @xmath0 color image there is _ no _ obvious vertical part of the `` t '' .",
    "however , there is nebulosity and ( again ) a clustering of red stars to the southeast of the cluster .",
    "this is part of the far infrared source which lester et al .",
    "( 1985 ) call g30.8s .",
    "according to lester et al .",
    "( 1985 ) there are two radio sources in between g30.8n and g30.8s which lie in a pronounced minimum of the far infrared emission .",
    "the western one of these was described by them as an unresolved @xmath1band source ( @xmath25 8th magnitude ) which they claimed was the source of ionization for g30.8 .",
    "this claim is confirmed in great detail by the images and spectra presented here .",
    "we have confirmed the location of the lester et al .",
    "@xmath1band source as the stellar cluster by comparing our near infrared images to a digitized sky survey image centered on their coordinates ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the spectroscopic targets , w43  # 1 , # 2 , and # 3 ( figures  [ w431 ] , [ w432 ] , [ w433 ] ) , were chosen from the preliminary cob cmd mentioned in  2.1 ( similar but not as deep as figure  [ cmd ] ) as the brightest likely members of the central cluster .",
    "the second brightest star is only 0.5@xmath12 e of w43  # 1 and was not observed spectroscopically because of its proximity to w43  # 1 .",
    "the effect of this star on the spectrum of w43  # 1 should not be too great since it was placed outside the 0.65@xmath12 slit , has similar color to w43  # 1 , and is only 25@xmath29 as bright as w43  # 1 .",
    "the line widths and equivalents widths ( ew ) of w43  # 1 are given in table  [ tab1 ] and compare well with those in figer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for wr  131 , a wn7 star of the hydrogen rich nitrogen sequence . the strong 2.1155   2.189  and br@xmath20 @xmath30 ( near 2.17  ) emission are the signatures of a wn star .",
    "cotera & simpson ( 1997 ) report emission in narrow  band near infrared images of w43 .",
    "this wn star is probably the source of the emission they observed .",
    "there is some similarity among the @xmath1band spectra of some of stars and late type wn stars ( conti et .",
    "1995 ) , but the excellent match to the spectrum for wr131 for w43  # 1 and the large line widths ( @xmath25 1400 ) argue strongly for a wn classification . comparing the line",
    "ew s and line widths to the other wn stars in figer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) indicates that w43  # 1 is not as hot as a wn6 type because these objects show stronger ( 2.19 ) emission relative to br@xmath20 . w43",
    "# 1 does not appear as cool as later type wn8 and wn9 stars which exhibit weaker emission and/or much stronger ( 2.06  ) emission . the long slit image of w43  # 1 indicates no significant nebular contamination to the stellar spectrum .",
    "comparison to the line ratios in figer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) also suggests this is the case .",
    "as noted above , w43  # 1 has a @xmath1band spectrum similar to the optically classified wn7 star wr  131 ( figer et al . 1997 ) .",
    "more precisely , wr  131 has an optical spectral classification of wn7@xmath31 , where @xmath31 refers to absorption lines seen in the _ optical _ spectrum .",
    "the absorption has some times been attributed to an unresolved companion star . while there is no evidence of absorption in the @xmath1band spectrum of w43  # 1 or the @xmath1band spectrum of wr  131 , it possible that w43  # 1 also has such a companion . this possibility is suggested by the fact that the standard star wn7 @xmath1band spectra appear to show a relative dilution of the @xmath1band features between those stars with and without _ optical _ absorption lines ( figer et al .",
    "1997 , compare wr120 and wr131 ; also p. eenens , private communication ) . and , it is the standards with the @xmath31 to which w43  # 1 is most similar .",
    "the spectrum of w43  # 2 is shown in figure  [ w432 ] . at 2.1155 , is clearly detected .",
    "the n  iii emission suggests that w43  # 2 is a mid to early o star ( hcr96 ) .",
    "in addition , there appears to be weak c  iv emission at 2.078  ( this line is typically less than one angstrom ew in somewhat higher resolution spectra of o stars , hcr ) and perhaps some stellar br@xmath20 emission .",
    "the overall br@xmath20 feature is predominately nebular emission ; it is difficult to perfectly remove this contribution as it is not uniform across the slit and this region of the spectrum was necessarily corrected with the telluric standard .",
    "2.189  absorption is not detected but can be weak or in emission for supergiant o stars ( hcr ) .",
    "the absence of 2.189  absorption in the spectrum of w43  # 2 may be naturally explained if it is a supergiant .",
    "a supergiant classification is consistent with its position in the @xmath11 v. @xmath23 cmd ( figure  [ cmd ] ; see below ) .",
    "the line at 2.06  is in absorption but this is probably an over  subtracted nebular contribution and/or imperfect telluric absorption correction .",
    "w43  # 3 has a @xmath1band spectrum ( figure  [ w433 ] ) which suggests it too is an o star .",
    "is detected as well as emission .",
    "the 2.078  line appears slightly weak relative to the 2.069  line ( the former is typically stronger ; see hcr )",
    ". this may not be too much of a concern in light of the weakness of the lines and the apparent signal to noise .",
    "strong emission features at 2.06  and br@xmath20 are also present .",
    "2.06  is not expected in normal o star spectra ( hcr96 ) so this emission ( and similarly br@xmath20 ) is likely nebular .",
    "in addition , there is non  uniform nebular emission in the long slit image of w43  # 3 .",
    "weak 2.189  absorption may be present in this spectrum ( ew 1.5  ) but the s / n in the region around 2.189  is insufficient for an accurate measurement ( the feature to the red side of 2.189  is due to incomplete telluric correction ) .",
    "rough estimates for the total line  of  sight extinction ( interstellar plus circumstellar ) were given in  3.1.1 .  and",
    "dereddened magnitudes can be derived for the spectroscopic targets using an adopted extinction law ( mathis 1990 ) , the observed colors and the intrinsic colors .",
    "the latter can be estimated from the spectroscopic classifications derived in the last sections . for o stars ,",
    "the intrinsic colors are small and the derived  depends most heavily on the extinction law and observed colors . for w43  # 2 and # 3",
    ", we adopt the colors for an early o star from koornneef ( 1983 ) cited above in  3.1.1 .    for wn stars ,",
    "the available data are sparse .",
    "we derive intrinsic @xmath24 and @xmath23 using the the power law spectral indices of morris et al .",
    "these models , derived from the observed spectral energy distributions of wr stars , characterize the emitted flux by f@xmath32 @xmath25 @xmath33 . for the wn7 stars analized by morris et al .",
    ", we find @xmath34 3.11 @xmath17 0.39 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath24 and @xmath23 @xmath35 0.16 and 0.13 , respectively ( this point is plotted in figure  [ cc ] ) .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath36 leads to an uncertainty in each color index of @xmath37 0.15 mag .",
    "this , in turn , leads to an uncertainty in  of @xmath37 0.25 mag .",
    "the positions of the three spectroscopic targets in figure  [ cc ] are in good agreement with these adopted intrinsic colors .",
    "w43  # 3 lies on the reddening line for an early o star , w43  # 1 is close to a projected line from the colors we derive for a wn7 star , and w43  # 3 is at least within the envelope for normal stars .    using these adopted colors , we find  @xmath35 3.55 mag , 3.52 mag , and 3.63 mag for w43  # 1 , # 2 , and # 3 , respectively .",
    "we have averaged the derived extinction calculated using the @xmath24 and @xmath23 colors separately , rather than attempting to deredden along lines parallel to those in figure  [ cc ] . for typical variations in the adopted extinction law ( mathis 1990 ) , the  will change by 0.25 mag .",
    "this uncertainty dominates over the photometric errors .",
    "the dense stellar cluster at the heart of w43 with associated evolved massive stars is reminiscent of the well studied clusters in ngc  3603 ( drissen et al .",
    "1995 ) in the galaxy and r136 in the giant h  ii region 30  doradus in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ; massey & hunter 1998 ) .",
    "a common thread between these two starburst clusters and w43 is the close spatial association of apparently evolved wn stars and younger o3 stars .",
    "our infrared spectral types are not precise enough to assign detailed sub",
    " types for w43  # 2 and w43  # 3 , but the latter is likely an early o star as discussed in  3.2.2 . both drissen et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and massey & hunter ( 1998 ) conclude that the wn objects are probably core hydrogen burning stars with such intense mass  loss winds that their spectra resemble the more evolved wr stars ( see also de koter et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the recently discovered starburst cluster 20 pc in projection from the galactic center , the arches cluster , is also similar to r136 , ngc  3603 , and w43 in that it contains many ( perhaps 100 ) o stars ( serabyn et al .",
    "1998 ) as well as wn stars ( cotera et al . 1996 ) in a remarkably small volume . like w43 ,",
    "the arches cluster is heavily obscured by interstellar extinction , and its stellar content can only be studied at near infrared wavelengths .",
    "nevertheless , w43 and the arches cluster suggest that nearby examples of the starburst phenomena are not as rare as previously thought .      in principle",
    ", the derived dereddened colors and spectral type can be used to estimate the distance to w  43 . in practice ,",
    "a meaningful estimate will require more spectra of stars in the cluster and additional luminosity indicators in the near infrared spectroscopic classification schemes .",
    "we plan to work on both of these aspects in the future . to illustrate the present difficulties , we consider the following .",
    "w43  # 1 has a spectral type with implicit uncertainties given the fact that , in at least one scenario (  3.2.1 ) , it suggests a potential companion . nevertheless , using an estimate from vacca & torres - dodgen ( 1990 ) for the @xmath38 ( @xmath146.54 @xmath17 0.43 mag ) of a typical wn7 ( including those with @xmath31 classifications ) and a derived @xmath39 ( 0.12 @xmath17 0.59 ) from morris et al .",
    "( 1993 ) a lower limit to the distance can be derived : 2800@xmath40 pc . where the uncertainty is dominated by the intrinsic scatter in @xmath38 and systematic uncertainty in @xmath39 due to the range of spectral index .",
    "this near distance compared to the radio distance ( 7 kpc ; see  1 ) suggests w43  # 1 likely does have some contamination in the @xmath1band brightness .",
    "similarly , the average distance for the two o stars is : 4300@xmath41 pc using @xmath38 ( @xmath146.44 @xmath17 0.67 mag ) from vacca et al .",

    "the above discussion can be reversed and the luminosity derived instead of the distance . adopting the radio distance of 7 kpc",

    "for example , w43  # 1 has an estimated @xmath50 of @xmath1411.5 mag compared to @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath1411.7 mag for the pistol star in the galactic center quintuplet cluster ( figer et al .",
    "the @xmath50 for w43  # 1 is derived using a bolometric correction of @xmath143.0 mag ( crowther et al .",
    "obviously , no definitive statements can yet be made for w43 with only three spectra in hand and in the face of the substantial uncertainties outlined here .",
    "intrinsic colors and magnitudes for rare spectral types like w43  # 1 may always provide difficulties . however , the colors for more normal o and b stars are well understood .",
    "as our spectral classification schemes improve and we obtain spectra of fainter o and b stars in the cluster , we will be able to better assess the distance to w43 and the luminosity of the individual stars .",
    "it is already clear that clusters like w43 will be very important in comparison to the galactic center star clusters and to the further study of massive stars in the milky way .      the combination of the lester et al .",
    "( 1985 ) far infrared maps and the present near infrared images and spectra suggest the following scenario .",
    "the stellar cluster appears between the strongest far infrared sources ( g30.08 n and s ) in a region of lower dust emission .",
    "the evolved nature of the central massive stars in the cluster and lower dust emission indicate the central cluster may have formed first and subsequently cleared away the remains of the gas and dust which came together to form it ( or is in the process of clearing it away : there are dark regions very close in projection to the central cluster ) .",
    "the embedded red objects seen in figure  [ clr2 ] in the regions coincident with the far infrared sources g30.08",
    "n and s may be newly forming stars more deeply embedded in the molecular clouds now being ionized by the central cluster ( and to some extent by massive stars forming within ) .",
    "we will test this scenario by searching for spectroscopic signatures of ysos in the brighter embedded objects in g30.08 n and s.",
    "near infrared images reveal a dense cluster of newly formed stars at the core of the galactic giant h  ii region w43 .",
    "spectra of three of the brightest cluster members show them to be hot , massive stars .",
    "the brightest member , w43  # 1 , has a @xmath1band spectrum very similar ( in morphology as well as line strength and width ) to similar spectra for optically classified wr stars of the wn7 type .",
    "recent observations near the galactic center , in ngc  3603 , and in r136 in the lmc all find wn type stars at the center of dense starburst clusters .",
    "a picture is emerging where these objects are thought to be core burning h stars with extreme mass  loss , rather than the somewhat older evolved counterparts of initially massive o stars .",
    "the combination of @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath11 images reveals a complex morphology in the region surrounding the stellar cluster .",
    "in particular , the spatial geometry suggests the starburst cluster may have triggered second generations of stars to form in the molecular material to the north and south .",
    "both these regions are locations of far infrared emission maxima which suggest even younger stars still more highly obscured .",
