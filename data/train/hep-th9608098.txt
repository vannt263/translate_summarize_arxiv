    "we will numerically evaluate the statistics of cosmic @xmath5 strings ( or , equivalently , vortices of superfluid @xmath6he ) and of @xmath0 strings ( like e.g.  line disclinations in nematic liquid crystals ) , in lattice - based simulations of the kibble mechanism .",
    "the numerical method will be presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , and contains on perhaps essential improvements to the usual vachaspati - vilenkin ( vv ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "the most important improvement in our calculations is that our lattice size is formally infinite , i.e.  we can avoid specifying any boundary conditions , and can trace much longer strings with a given amount of computer memory than was possible before .",
    "the vv algorithm in general discretises space such that the lattice spacing corresponds to the smallest physical length beyond which field values can be considered to be uncorrelated , i.e.  the lattice spacing @xmath7 is of the order of , but perhaps slightly larger than the correlation length @xmath8 of the field at the symmetry - breaking phase transition , but certainly no larger than the cosmological horizon .",
    "details of the field dynamics are then inessential to the statistical properties of a large ensemble of such lattices , and vacuum field values are assigned randomly and independently at each space - point to create a monte - carlo ensemble of field configurations on the lattice .",
    "it should be pointed out that the regular lattice we use has been criticised , as it does not allow variations in the size of correlated domains . in particular ,",
    "some of the results of borrill s simulations  @xcite are rather different from ours , for reasons which are still poorly understood . however , they may well suffer from important finite size effects .",
    "line defects are then considered to have formed if a closed walk along lattice links maps , through the field map , onto a non - contractible loop on the vacuum manifold .",
    "the assumption of a ` geodesic rule ' @xcite for the interpolation of the field between the lattice points is not only intuitively acceptable , but in this formalism it is also essential in order to guarantee string flux conservation , an essential symmetry of the problem  @xcite .",
    "@xcite also prove that only the dual lattice to the tetrakaidekahedral lattice can preserve a uniqueness in the identification of the paths of single strings and rotational symmetry of the monte carlo ensemble at the same time .",
    "this lattice has been used in this context in refs .",
    "@xcite , and to study simulations of monopoles and textures  @xcite .",
    "strings are usually modelled by random walks , either brownian or self - avoiding .",
    "a self - avoiding random walk ( saw ) models an excluded volume effect , and is known to apply well to polymers @xcite",
    ". however , it is not clear that either kind of walk represents the configurational statistics of cosmic strings or superfluid vortices , for there are long - range interactions which could change the hausdorff dimension . that there are super  horizon correlations in the configurations of topological defects is not exactly new @xcite .",
    "in the case of cosmic strings it can be demonstrated by arriving at a simple contradiction when assuming no long  range correlations : take a closed circular walk through three ",
    "space spanning many correlation volumes .",
    "how many strings does one expect to encircle with such a walk ?",
    "since there is a well - defined string density per correlation area , the number of encircled strings should increase proportionally with the area @xmath9 enclosed by the walk .",
    "if they are uncorrelated , the net flux through this area will be partially cancelled by strings of opposite orientation , and one expects an average net flux of around @xmath10 going through the loop formed by our walk . on the other hand ,",
    "the net flux is given also by seeing how often the field winds around @xmath5 while one follows the walk .",
    "this number , however , is expected to increase as the square root of the length of the walk , since the field values are uncorrelated on some length scale which is small compared to the size of the loop , and many of the windings will cancel out .",
    "one therefore has to conclude that , if the kibble mechanism is responsible for the formation of strings ( i.e.  if the _ field values _ are uncorrelated beyond some scale initially ) , the string network will have long  range correlation , favouring for instance flux cancellation for oriented strings on large surfaces .",
    "one should therefore expect deviations from brownian behaviour in the string statistics .",
    "this is also favoured , because a cosmic string clearly _ is _ self  avoiding  , which does not mean , however , that the statistics are those of a self  avoiding _ random _ walk ( saw ) , because the nature of the self  avoidance is dictated by the field map .",
    "a saw shows correlations only on very short scales ( typically scales of the lattice constant ) .",
    "one of the reasons why strings also can not be randomly self  avoiding , is that the field map carries the memory of the position of all the other strings , which can not be crossed .",
    "we will show that neither a brownian walk nor a random self  avoiding walk model cosmic strings accurately , and that the walk statistics depend on the vacuum manifold creating the strings .      a @xmath5 string in the vachaspati ",
    "vilenkin algorithm on a tetrahedral lattice is self  avoiding @xcite , irrespective of the discretisation ( if any ) of @xmath5 used in the algorithm .",
    "one might therefore expect the network of cosmic strings to have the statistical properties of a self - avoiding random walk .",
    "a saw builds up an excluded volume as it follows its path , which is , in a statistical sense , spherically symmetric and clustered around the origin  @xcite .",
    "the saw therefore has a stronger tendency to move away from the origin than the brownian walk , which is allowed to intersect itself arbitrarily often .",
    "this property is expressed in the fractal dimension @xmath11 of the walk , which is the exponent relating the average string length @xmath12 between two points on the same string to their relative distance @xmath13 by @xmath14 where the brackets @xmath15 denote some averaging procedure over a large ensemble of walks   { n^{-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n |r^n|}=\\sqrt[n]{\\langle |r^n|\\rangle}\\ ] ] produce the same results for the fractal dimension , such that in particular @xmath16  @xcite . ] .",
    "it is well known that the dimension for a brownian walk is @xmath17 , and for a self - avoiding random walk in three dimensions it is @xmath18 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein for a summary of different methods used to obtain that result ) .",
    "however , the original string formation simulations @xcite are consistent with @xmath17 .",
    "the reason for this was seen in the fact that they simulated a dense string network : a single string , as we trace out its path , experiences a repulsion from all of the segments of other strings , which do not have any statistical bias towards the origin .",
    "therefore the repulsion from the forbidden volume will also have no directional bias .",
    "thus the fractal dimension of the string could also be argued to be ( close to ) two , although the string is self  avoiding . in polymer physics , this effect has been known for some time to occur in a dense solution of polymers  @xcite . in a statistical sense ,",
    "the network of cosmic strings was argued to be equivalent to a dense network of polymers @xcite .",
    "a polymer in a dilute solution will exhibit the configurational statistics of a self  avoiding random walk , while in a dense solution of polymers , each one has the structure of a brownian random walk .",
    "thus , taking this lesson from polymer physics , one would expect the scaling of the string size @xmath13 with length @xmath12 in the initial configuration of cosmic strings to correspond to a saw on scales smaller than the mean separation between different strings , and to a brownian walk on scales larger than this . in the cosmic string case , however , the mean separation is of the order of the correlation length itself , which is the same as the lattice spacing .",
    "so we expect the bias towards a saw to fall off with distance roughly as fast as the lattice discretisation errors , which makes this short  distance effect immeasurable .",
    "we shall anticipate the results of the following chapters : the fractal dimension of a string at formation is in general not the same as for a brownian walk .",
    "it is only for @xmath5 strings that measurements are consistent with the exact value of two , in the extremely long - distance limit ( @xmath19 to @xmath20 lattice units ) of the other strings which have been measured , none have fractal dimensions higher than the @xmath5 strings , but all have distinctly larger @xmath11 than the saw .",
    "as is customary , we can introduce the scaling hypothesis in order to estimate a few other properties of the string network , which states that , in terms of its statistical properties , the string network looks the same on all scales much larger than the correlation length of the vacuum field .",
    "in fact , brownian random walks are scale invariant . with the scaling hypothesis ,",
    "the expected distribution of closed loops can be derived  @xcite . from dimensional arguments",
    ", the number of closed loops with size from @xmath13 to @xmath21 per unit volume can be written as @xmath22 if the system is scale invariant , the distribution should be independent of the correlation length @xmath8 , and one expects @xmath23 the length distribution of loops for strings with a fractal dimension of @xmath11 is therefore @xmath24 with @xmath25 or more generally @xmath26 , with @xmath27 being the dimension of the space wich the walk is embedded in .",
    "it was originally expected @xcite that it follows from scale invariance that there should be no infinite strings .",
    "this turned out not to be the case , since , as we will discuss in section  [ section : u1perfect ] , ensembles of infinite strings and ensembles of loops manifest scale invariance in entirely different ways , namely in the validity of the eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dimension ] ) and ( [ eq : scaling ] ) , respectively .",
    "infinite strings can still look statistically the same on all scales much larger than the lattice spacing : a brownian walk is scale invariant and has a non - zero probability not to return to the origin in @xmath28 dimensions .",
    "the origin of the scale invariance of the string network seems to be connected with the absence of long - range correlations in the order parameter @xcite .",
    "however , scale invariance does not necessarily imply that the network is brownian as originally stated .",
    "strictly speaking , scale invariance holds when all the scaling properties of a network , such as eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dimension ] ) and ( [ eq : lengthdistr ] ) are power laws : only power laws do not change upon linear rescaling of the variables . in this sense",
    ", scaling is satisfied whenever the eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dimension ] ) and ( [ eq : lengthdistr ] ) hold .",
    "however , to make scaling also work in spite of finite size effects prohibiting us from identifying the very long loops , eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaling ] ) is taken as the manifestation of scale invariance .",
    "this is plausible : eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaling ] ) implies that loops exhibit ( on scales larger much than the lattice spacing but much smaller than the loop size ) the same fractal dimension as infinite strings , so that on scales where one counts some number of loops wrongly as infinite strings , the distinction between the two becomes unnecessary ) is a more stringent definition of scale invariance , because it allows to be ignorant about effects on scales which a particular observation may not reach .",
    "if we defined scale invariance by some omniscient observer which can distinguish loops even if they exceed the observed scale in size , then there is no reason for the exponents of the loop distribution to be in any relation to the exponents of the distribution in infinite strings . ] .",
    "one does of course not need @xmath17 in order to have a scale - free distribution of loop sizes @xmath13 .",
    "it is important to note that , because of eqs .",
    "[ eq : dimension ] and [ eq : lengthdistr ] , although they are the criterion for scale - invariance , there are some observables which are not scale - invariant , if they happen to be dependent on the uv cutoff .",
    "an example of this is the fraction of string mass in loops , as discussed in  @xcite and item 3 in the next section .",
    "whatever numbers one gets for these quantities are probably unphysical , since there is no known algorithm ( least of all vv type algorithms ) that would tell us what the physical uv cutoff on the loop size distribution eq .",
    "[ eq : lengthdistr ] should look like .",
    "scale - invariance can only hold in the limit @xmath29 .    if @xmath17 , one would expect a linear relationship between walk length and average @xmath30 , which would then , if the probability distribution for ending up at a point @xmath31 after @xmath12 steps is gaussian , be interpretable as the average @xmath32 of the distribution .",
    "all this is familiar from the brownian walk , and measurements seem to indicate that  in the case of a @xmath5 symmetry , we are close to such statistics . fig .",
    "[ fig : linlinu1003 ] presents the linear  linear graph of @xmath30 vs.  the walk length @xmath12 , which can be seen to be an almost perfectly linear relation .",
    "the measurements in figs .",
    "[ fig : linlinu1003 ] and [ fig : loglogu1003 ] are made using a discretisation of @xmath5 by three equidistant angles by @xmath33 .",
    "this only is correct as far as the allowed vacuum angles are concerned , but may be misleading , since in an actual @xmath33 symmetry the lines which we identify as geodesics on @xmath5 would be associated with a finite vacuum energy ( i.e.  they would be crossing domain walls ) .",
    "it is more correct to say that we triangulate the vacuum manifold as well as space : in this case with 3 vertices and 3 edges , joining adjacent points .",
    "this automatically encodes the geodesic rule .",
    "this distinction seems trivial , but it allows an easier generalisation to e.g.  discretisations of @xmath34 .",
    "such measurements were made in  @xcite , and we complete results from there .",
    "in particular , we present a much better error analysis here .",
    "results are represented split between the infinite string part and the loop contribution .",
    "this is a procedure we will follow throughout this paper , in analogy to conventions in percolation theory , and we will show that it is in fact necessary to do so",
    ".     +     +",
    "before we turn to the results , a few words of caution are in order . among those , we include an explanation of how we arrive at error estimates for the statistical error .    1 .   because of the nature of the monte carlo averaging , there are two big sources of error for very long loops ( i.e.  the longest ones permitted in the simulations ) .",
    "we follow every string until it hits a certain upper limit of the string length @xmath35 , or until it returns to the origin , whatever happens first .",
    "if it does not return to the origin until we have reached the length @xmath36 , it is counted towards the  infinite string \" ensemble .",
    "this does not introduce too many problems for the averaging over infinite strings ( as long as there are many ) , because of the nature of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dn ] ) , which ensures that only very few of the strings surviving up to length @xmath36 are actually wrongly counted as infinite . for the loop distribution , which has only very few strings in this regime ,",
    "the statistical errors are huge ( in the end , usually just before we reach @xmath37 , we even  average \" over one string only ) but the systematic errors in this regime are equally bad , because there is a finite number of strings which _ should _ be in the loop distribution , but are not identified as loops .",
    "this drives the measured @xmath30 to zero at the length where the longest of correctly identified loops closes ( compare the lower line in fig .",
    "[ fig : linlinu1003 ] .",
    "extraction of configurational exponents on the loop distribution will therefore be defined through fitting appropriate curves which approach the actual measurements asymptotically in the intermediate ",
    "length regime only . 2 .",
    "a word of caution is also necessary for the short ",
    "length limits . as seen for example in fig .",
    "[ fig : loglogu1003 ] , scaling is not satisfied in the short walk  length regime .",
    "this is due to two sources of error .",
    "firstly , there are obviously lattice discretisation artifacts .",
    "secondly , at small distances the excluded volume effect ( from the self  avoiding nature of the string ) is still turned on , with a directional bias away from the origin . eventually , repulsion from all other pieces of string should even out with repulsion from pieces of the same string , with no directional bias at all , but this happens only at some distance from the origin .",
    "we will allow for this source of error by cutting off the low length regime at lengths between 10 and 1000 lattice units   and @xmath38 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lengthdistr2 ] ) , while 500 is very good , and still perfectly practical , for extracting the fractal dimension @xmath11 on the infinite string part . which cutoff to choose",
    "is decided on a case by case basis by observing where a cutoff independent measurement can be obtained .",
    "] whenever we measure configurational exponents from the monte carlo ensembles .",
    "3 .   frequently , we will not quote the fraction of the total string mass found in loops .",
    "such numbers are meaningless , unless there is a lower cutoff for loop lengths much larger that one in units of correlation lengths ( in which case one gets very little mass in loops anyway )",
    ". this parameter is lattice ",
    "dependent  @xcite , even for simple brownian random walks or self  avoiding random walks .",
    "this is partly due to different coordination numbers of different lattices ( e.g.  every vertex on the tetrakaidekahedral lattice is connected to four lattice links , while this number is six in the simple cubic case .",
    "there are more possibilities for the string to  stray \" in the simple cubic case ) .",
    "this is connected with another lattice dependence of this number : the length of the lattice links in the tetrakaidekahedral case is @xmath39 , with @xmath7 the edge length of the underlying bcc lattice , while the correlation length is between @xmath40 and @xmath7  , while one pair is separated by @xmath7 . when we refer to ",
    "walk lengths in lattice units \" we mean in units of @xmath39 , which is the edge length of the tetrakaidekahedral lattice . ] .",
    "since the smallest allowed loops in both lattices consist of four links , the tetrakaidekahedral lattice allows much smaller loops ( in units of correlation lengths ) than the simple cubic lattice . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : dn ] ) , we expect a large contribution to the total string mass to be in very small loops , so that on a tetrakaidekahedral lattice the total string mass in loops will be considerably higher than on the cubic lattice .",
    "the problem of the lattice dependence of the mass fraction in loops also reflects a lack of knowledge about the physics involved in the production of small loops .",
    "physically , one would expect a smooth cutoff for short loops , so that the very small loop contribution in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dn ] ) gets gradually suppressed .",
    "we do not know the form of this cutoff , and we expect it to depend not only on dynamical details of the kibble mechanism , but also on thermal production mechanisms for string loops ( which should be relevant right at the phase transition temperature , but quickly become subdominant as the universe cools further ) . in any case , the physical relevance of knowing the exact contribution to the total string mass in small loops produced at a phase transition is highly questionable , as they disappear quickly in any case .",
    "this does not affect the physical relevance of the other data we can extract from vachaspati  vilenkin type measurements , because the long loops and infinite strings are not transient .",
    "4 .   finally",
    ", we need to explain how we arrived at the values for the statistical error : to estimate , for instance , the statistical error percentage of the fractal dimension @xmath11 , measured for a total number of @xmath41 strings up to a length @xmath36 , we take for example 10 sets of @xmath42 strings and measure the variance of the result , then take 10 sets of @xmath43 and 10 sets of @xmath44 strings and so on .",
    "we then measure the variance of the results for all those sets , and , under the assumption that the error behaves like a power of the size of the string ensemble , we extrapolate to an ensemble of @xmath41 strings . if all our measurables were gaussian random variables for any sample within the ensemble , this power law would just be @xmath45 , which motivates this approach .",
    "since configurational exponents are normally not distributed in a gaussian distribution within samples of the ensemble , we decided to allow a generalised power law for the variance .",
    "we present this method by the example of a @xmath5 manifold discretised by @xmath46 equidistant vacuum angles .",
    "[ fig : loglogu1003 ] , the log  log plot of @xmath47 vs.  @xmath12 , has a linear fit suggesting @xmath48 this was measured for @xmath49 strings being allowed to reach the length 50,000 in lattice units ( taking only the  infinite \" strings , and using a lower cutoff of 500 lattice units ) .",
    "similar measurements on several ensembles with less strings yield the values in table  [ table : varianceu1003 ] .",

    "they are all expected , as discussed in section  [ subsection : rga ] .",
    "what is not discussed there is that the stability of the fixed points is determined by the sign of @xmath54 at the fixed points .",
    "as expected again , the fixed points 0 and 1 are the only stable ones , so that this renormalization procedure would get rid of all infinite strings for any @xmath55 , which is clearly different from our measurements .",
    "a renormalization procedure that merely performs field averages is therefore not sufficient to describe the hagedorn transition in the initial conditions ( but it may perhaps describe the disappearance of infinite strings in the subsequent dynamical evolution , as observed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we stress that we havent been able to find any non - trivial fixed points for various generalisations of eq .",
    "[ eq : renormu1 ] .",

    "the kronecker deltas just divide out factors of two or three , depending on whether the most frequent vacuum phases are more than one , as e.g.  in the fourth to last and last row of table  [ table : rg ] .",
    "we have tried the same approach for a minimally discretised @xmath0 symmetry where it is in fact much easier to write down the renormalisation polynomial for the bias , but again , all the fixed points are the trivial ones , and the percolation threshold can not be located in this way .",

    "clearly , this is most easily done for @xmath65 strings , where the string flux can only be 0 or 1 ( or better :  even \" or ",

    "as seen in all the models for @xmath65 strings ( i.e.  the vachaspati model , our calculations for @xmath0 , and the calculations of kibble for @xmath66 strings  @xcite ) , this is essentially done by identifying lattice links as having one of the two values @xmath67 assigned to them , and taking the product over a closed contour .",
    "the obvious approach is therefore to associate two consecutive links with a super  link , and assigning to it the product of the two link values . on any lattice ( cubic or tetrahedral ) , this preserves the string flux in the sense that the string flux through a super  plaquette is zero ( even ) if the sum of the string lines penetrating the constituent plaquettes is even , and odd ( one ) otherwise .",

    "[ fig : rp2renorm ]     +    the third dimension does not have to be drawn , since the renormalization procedures for differently oriented links are independent from each other ( the second dimension is only necessary to show how changes in the string flux survive the renormalization procedure ) .",

    "summarising both sections of this appendix , the question of how to formulate a renormalization group transformation which identifies the hagedorn transition point as a fixed point remains unanswered , as does the question of which variables one should preserve in such a transformation .",
    "in ref .  @xcite we attempted to extract a statistical temperature definition from the probability distribution of strings .",
    "this can of course only be done by analogy to statistical mechanics arguments .",
    "it will turn out that the thus obtained temperature is meaningless in physical terms , and that we arrive at a circular argument , giving us that @xmath91 should be interpreted as an inverse temperature , which is not the case , as we argued before .",
    "thus , comparisons with thermal ensembles or thermal partition functions are not appropriate .",
    "if we define a probability density that a given string segment belongs to a loop in the length interval @xmath92 $ ] by @xmath93 , we can define an information entropy , contained in the probability distribution function by @xmath94 we can for instance try to relate the average length of string loops to an average energy of a thermal ensemble .",
    "it would then make sense to define a temperature @xmath95 as @xmath96 and see how the system behaves under changes of the bias . in ref .",
    "@xcite we did not have good enough statistics to extract that parameter , but with the partition function we do not need to get involved with the numerically highly unstable division of two differentials , because , without normalization , @xmath97 the entropy can then be split into two parts @xmath98=s_1+s_2 \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,.\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\ ] ] then @xmath99 @xmath100 , by partial integration , behaves as @xmath101 \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\ , \\end{array}\\ ] ] thus , with @xmath102d(\\delta\\eta ) \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\ ] ] and @xmath103 we obtain @xmath104\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\ ] ] and the thus obtained temperature diverges , up to logarithmic corrections , as @xmath105 , and the hagedorn transition happens at infinite @xmath95 .",
    "thus , the correspondence of our partition function with a thermal one does not hold .",

    "<S> matter systems , as well as the vacuum in the early universe , are  in the process of being cooled  subject to phase transitions . </S>",
    "<S> if these transitions are accompanied by symmetry breaking , they may lead to the formation of defects : domain walls , strings or vortices , monopoles , or a combination of these , depending on the topology of the set of equilibrium states after the phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> in cosmology such defects are associated with internal symmetries of a field theory , while in condensed matter systems there are defects associated with the rotational symmetry of the ground  state . </S>",
    "<S> such defects in a nematic liquid crystal are called disclinations @xcite . along a closed path around line disclinations , </S>",

    "<S> it is this lack of correlation which allows the initial conditions to trap topological defects after phase transitions . </S>",
    "<S> defects are also a convenient and compelling way to seed large - scale structure formation in the early universe . </S>",

    "<S> we also find that the critical exponents for configurational parameters near the percolation threshold are universal for different vacuum manifolds , and identical ( to within our statistical errors ) to the corresponding critical exponents in standard bond or site percolation theory . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite , the accuracy of the results is greatly improved , results for the @xmath0 symmetry are new , and statistical errors are estimated . </S>",
