    "lloyd and braunstein extended the quantum computation to the cv region and derived the necessary and sufficient conditions for achieving universal cv qc @xcite .",
    "successively , the cv qc with optical coherent states @xcite and the encoding schemes for cv computation were proposed @xcite .",

    "the difference between these teleporters and the normal teleportation systems furusawa1998,bowen2003,zhang2003 is that there are two input states ( target and control ) in these teleporters and both of their information is transmitted to the two output states simultaneously . to achieve the basic operation of one - way quantum computation the four - partite cluster entanglement plays irreplaceable roles . in cv qcs",
    ", we have to establish entanglement between the output target and control modes for further quantum information processing . according to the theoretical calculation duan2000 for achieving the entanglement of the two output states",
    "the initial squeezing degree of cluster resources should be higher than @xmath0 7 db .",
    "although the entanglement between output states was not observed in the present experiment due to the absence of better cluster resources , the proof - of - principle experiment proves that the controlled - x operation of one - way qc can be unconditionally demonstrated with the designed system if cv cluster states of higher entanglement are available .",
