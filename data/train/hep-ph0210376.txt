    "the wealth of new data from the @xmath2 factories belle and babar has caused a great amount of phenomenological interest in @xmath2 decays in recent years .",
    "already the much anticipated measurement of @xmath9 @xcite has been achieved , and many new results in the field of rare @xmath2 decays ( e.g. @xmath10 @xcite and @xmath11 @xcite ) are eagerly awaited .",
    "less attention has been devoted to charmed ( @xmath12 ) meson decays , although the @xmath2 factories and forthcoming cleo  c promise the largest sample of charmed mesons to date . @xmath12",
    "mesons may be produced at the @xmath2 factories by two mechanisms : i ) continuum @xmath13 production and ii ) decay of @xmath2 mesons . while the majority of @xmath2 decays",
    "involve some charmed particles , it is difficult to extract charm data from these decays due to the high multiplicity of particles in the final states . with the high luminosity of the @xmath2 factories ,",
    "however , a lot of @xmath14 pairs that subsequently hadronize to @xmath12 mesons are produced directly in the collision of the primary @xmath15 beams .",
    "both belle and babar will each have about @xmath16 @xmath13 continuum events in the anticipated data samples of @xmath17 fb@xmath18 , thus providing a rich testing ground for charm decays . at cleo - c ,",
    "prospects are also very promising with the threshold production of @xmath12 mesons offering distinct advantages over the @xmath13 continuum production at the @xmath2 factories , which compensates for the lower luminosity of cleo - c @xcite .",
    "these experiments will have substantially increased sensitivity to the purely leptonic decays of the charged @xmath19 mesons , @xmath20 and @xmath21 . in the sm",
    ", such decays occur via @xmath22 annihilation in the @xmath23-channel and provide an opportunity to measure the decay constants ( @xmath24 ) for @xmath25 and @xmath19 . of these six leptonic decays , only @xmath26 and @xmath27 have been observed , from which @xmath28 is measured with an error @xmath29 .",
    "the @xmath19 decays are cabbibo suppressed compared to @xmath25 , and none have been observed except for 1 event for @xmath30 .",
    "the @xmath2 factories and cleo - c will offer improved measurements of @xmath26 and @xmath27 , which in turn will significantly reduce the error in the current measurements of @xmath28 .",
    "observation of @xmath30 ( or the less accessible @xmath31 ) will provide the first serious measurement of @xmath32 .",
    "in this paper we advocate searching for physics beyond the sm through these decays .",
    "of special interest are @xmath1 and @xmath0 for which no experimental limits exist , but could readily be searched for at the above experiments . in the sm",
    "these are severely helicity suppressed by @xmath33 and have brs of order @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "hence such decays have been largely overlooked since ( in the context of the sm ) they can not offer a measurement of the decay constant with present or upcoming data samples . however , the smallness of their brs enables these decays to play a new role of probing models beyond the sm .",
    "we show that slepton contributions in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with explicit @xmath3 parity violation can enhance these brs to @xmath4 , a result which strongly motivates a search in these channels .",
    "although the effect of new physics in purely leptonic decays is sometimes tainted by the uncertainty in the decay constant , the tiny sm branching ratios for @xmath1 and @xmath0 assure that mere observation of these decays at the aforementioned machines would be an unambiguous signal of physics beyond the sm .",
    "our work is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the @xmath19 meson annihilation decays . in section 3",
    "we show how these decays can be enhanced in @xmath3 parity violating susy models .",
    "section 4 presents our numerical results and section 5 contains our conclusions .",
    "to date the primary interest in measuring the purely leptonic decays @xmath36 has been to obtain information on the charged @xmath12 meson decay constants @xcite . in the sm",
    "these decays proceed via annihilation to a @xmath22 in the @xmath37channel ( see fig.1 ) . due to helicity suppression ,",
    "the rate is proportional to @xmath38 , and the phase space suppression is particularly severe for @xmath39 .",

    "one can see that the decays involving @xmath59 have tiny brs , while those involving @xmath60 and @xmath39 have brs in the range @xmath61 .",
    "of the six possible decays , only two have been measured with any sort of accuracy , yielding a world average of @xmath62 mev @xcite .",
    "additionally there is a very imprecise measurement of @xmath30 based on 1 observed event , giving @xmath63 mev @xcite . of the three decays which have not been searched for",
    ", @xmath1 and @xmath0 have particularly clean signatures . with the expected large samples of @xmath19 and @xmath25 mesons at belle , babar and cleo - c @xcite",
    ", these experiments should be sensitive to br@xmath64 .",
    "cleo - c aims to accumulate 30 million @xmath19 events ( 6 million fully tagged ) and 1.5 million @xmath25 events ( 0.3 million fully tagged ) by the end of 2004 .",
    "belle and babar expect @xmath65 @xmath13 continuum events by the end of 2005 .",
    "mere observation of these decays would be an patent signal of physics beyond the sm . in the next section",
    "we show that susy particles in @xmath3 parity violating extensions of the mssm can enhance these decays to experimental observability .",
    "thus in addition to offering measurements of the charged @xmath12 meson decay constants , the purely leptonic decays of @xmath66 mesons assume a new role of probing physics beyond the sm . in @xcite",
    "cleo - c is considering increasing the selection efficiency of the @xmath67channel by waiving the @xmath67tag requirement , stating that no @xmath68contamination is to be expected due to the small sm rate of the respective channel .",
    "we strongly encourage also performing an analysis with a muon identification tag , because the @xmath68channel can substantially contribute to the total leptonic annihilation decay rate as will be shown later in this paper .",
    "the related decays @xmath69 , are known to have larger brs than @xmath70 in the sm @xcite .",
    "this is because the presence of a photon in the final state removes the helicity suppression .",
    "the analysis of @xcite finds br@xmath71 and br@xmath72 ) the `` effective '' sm prediction for br@xmath73 ) should include the contribution from br@xmath74 ) with a soft photon ( i.e. one which can not be detected experimentally ) , whose infra - red singularity cancels with the radiative corrections to br(@xmath70 ) : @xmath75 however , the soft photon contribution is only a small fraction of the total rate for br(@xmath69 ) , and so br@xmath76 ) would still be below the expected experimental sensitivity of @xmath77 .",
    "hence we suggest that observation of br@xmath78 could only be attributed to physics beyond the sm .",
    "we note that inclusive measurements of the br(@xmath79 ) have been performed , to which any enhanced @xmath80 would have contributed .",
    "however , the error in the measurements of @xmath81 @xcite and @xmath82 @xcite still allow for contributions from @xmath80 of the order of a percent or more .",
    "the main motivation for @xmath3 parity violating susy @xcite is to account for the observed neutrino oscillations without increasing the particle content of the mssm @xcite .",
    "the superpotential is given by : @xmath84 bilinear terms @xmath85 are also possible , but have negligible impact on the annihilation decays we consider .",
    "since the @xmath86 term can mediate proton decay , it is customary to assume that the @xmath87 couplings vanish due to some discrete symmetry ( e.g. baryon parity ) .",
    "the simplest approach to @xmath3 parity violating phenomenology is to assume that a single @xmath3 parity violating coupling in the _ weak basis _",
    "@xmath88 ) is dominant with all others negligibly small .",
    "it was shown that such an approach leads to several non - zero @xmath3 parity violating couplings in the _ mass basis _",
    "@xmath89 due to quark mixing @xcite : @xmath90 here we have assumed that all quark mixing lies in the up  type sector , so that the mixing matrix is the usual kobayashi  maskawa matrix @xmath91 . this simplification avoids the appearance of the right  handed quark mixing matrix and gives the most conservative limits on the @xmath3 parity violating couplings , which would otherwise be constrained more severely from the decay @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "a realistic @xmath3 parity violating model would have many non ",
    "zero couplings _ in the weak basis _ and",
    "so in general would have a very rich phenomenology provided the couplings are not too small .",
    "it has been emphasised before that the purely leptonic decays are very sensitive at tree level to @xmath3 parity violating trilinear interactions , and thus these decays constitute excellent probes of the model e.g. the decays @xmath93 may be enhanced up to current experimental sensitivity @xcite .",

    "these decays have no @xmath23channel contributions of the type @xmath115 due to the absence of the coupling @xmath116 in the lagrangian .",
    "we wish to focus on the decays @xmath117 , in particular the helicity unsuppressed @xmath23channel contributions mediated by combinations of @xmath115 .",
    "although these decays might be problematic at the tevatron due to the missing energy of @xmath118 , they can be readily searched for at the @xmath15 machines belle , babar and cleo - c .",

    "the limits on such combinations is @xmath127 , which is @xmath128 better than the product of the single coupling limits , and at first sight would seem to rule out the possibility of a sizably enhanced @xmath70 mediated by @xmath115 combinations .",
    "however , large brs for @xmath70 can occur if the neutrino is @xmath129 .",
    "this is because the corresponding decay in the kaon sector would involve a @xmath122 lepton in the final state , which is kinematically impossible .",
    "the only possibility for a lepton flavour violating kaon decay mediated by these combinations of couplings would be @xmath130 . here",
    "the additional suppression factors ( e.g.  off  shell propagators , additional vertices ) easily weaken the limits on the relevant @xmath115 couplings to @xmath123 where the single coupling bounds become more restrictive than the bounds from kaon decays .",
