    "the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet)@xmath9}$ ] has been proven to be a powerful tool dealing with the physics of hadrons containing a heavy quark , and based on it there have been a lot of developments in the study of the heavy flavor weak decay .",
    "the advantage of hqet in dealing with the weak decays of heavy hadrons is that the number of the form factors describing hadronic matrix elements is reduced .",
    "for example , in @xmath10 transition all the form factors can be expressed in terms of the isgur - wise function and a unknown parameter @xmath11 to order 1/@xmath12 where @xmath12 is @xmath3 or @xmath2 quark mass , and in the heavy - to - light processes such as @xmath13 , the use of hqet in the limit @xmath4 allows one to express this transition in terms of two independent form factors@xmath14}$ ] . in order to find the relations for the remaining form factors for the heavy to light transitions , recently , stech@xmath15}$ ]",
    "proposed a new approach dealing with heavy - to - light transitions in the case of mesons where two simple dynamical assumptions for spectator particle in the decay process are made . in the present work , we will try to generalize stech s work to the baryon cases , i.e. , @xmath16 transitions .",
    "it will be found that this can provide an additional relation between the form factors @xmath17 and @xmath18 in the limit @xmath4 .",
    "the decrease of the form factor number can simplify calculations . however , these form factors contain all soft qcd effects , which are difficult to be calculated from the fist principle",
    ". therefore , one must resort to some phenomenological models to calculate them .",
    "a very interesting process is @xmath19 .",
    "ua1@xmath20}$ ] reported the measurement result @xmath21/@xmath22 where @xmath23 is the fraction of @xmath2 quark transition into @xmath24 , while cdf@xmath25}$ ] and opal@xmath26}$ ] only observed the upper limit @xmath27 and @xmath28 respectively . on the other hand , theoretically , in refs .",
    "[ 7 ] and [ 8 ] the authors discussed the process @xmath5/@xmath6 on the basis of hqet and some phenomenal considerations .",
    "their results for the branching ratios of @xmath5/@xmath6 are different : in [ 7 ] @xmath29/@xmath30 is of order @xmath31 from quark model calculations , while in [ 8 ] it is found that @xmath29/@xmath6)=@xmath32 by extracting form factors at @xmath33 from experiments .",
    "the up - down asymmetry parameter @xmath34 which in fact depends on the ratio between two form factors in the amplitude of @xmath13 in heavy quark limit , is -0.11 in [ 7 ] and 0.25 in [ 8 ] .",
    "hence , both theoretically and experimentally , the branching ratio of @xmath5/@xmath6 is very equivocal and to clarify this issue is necessary .",
    "this paper is organized as the following : in sect.2 we recapitulate the stech s approach and then generalize it to the case of baryons and find a relation between @xmath17 and @xmath18 . to determine @xmath17 and @xmath18",
    "absolutely , another relation between @xmath17 and @xmath18 obtained in the model of guo and kroll@xmath35}$ ] is applied to our case in sect.3 . in sec.4 the branching ratio of @xmath5/@xmath6 in heavy quark limit is obtained .",
    "the last section is devoted to conclusion .",
    "in this section , we briefly review stech s approach@xmath15}$ ] to deal with the heavy - to - light transitions in the meson case .",
    "the key point of the stech s method is the following two dynamical assumptions :    i ) . in the rest frame of a meson",
    "the off - shell energy of a constituent quark is close to its constituent mass independent or little dependent of its space momentum .",
    "ii ) . in the first stage of the weak transition ,",
    "i.e. , before final hadronization , the spectator quark retains its original momentum and spin .    from assumption",
    "i ) , one can think that the off - shell energy of the spectator quark @xmath36 in the rest frame of a meson is remarkably smaller than b - quark mass @xmath37 . using these two assumptions and some lorentz transition relations between the initial and final state rest frames",
    ", stech arrives at three conclusions : ( a ) , in the first stage of the weak transition , the energy carried by the spectator quark is approximately equal to that of the spectator in the rest frame of the final state particle even for energetic transition , i.e. , the spectator does nt pick up a large energy fraction ; ( b ) , in the process of weak transition , even with large energy release , the relevant b - quark space momenta are much smaller than b - quark mass and of the order of confinement scale .",
    "( c ) , in the first stage of the weak decay the generated @xmath38 or @xmath3-quark carries energy and longitudinal momentum of the final particle , apart from correction of order @xmath39/@xmath40 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the energy of spectator quark in final state rest frame and the energy of final particle in the initial meson rest frame , respectively .    making use of these conclusions and taking a reasonable assumption into account that the average of the transverse momentum squared of the b - quark @xmath41 is very small compared to @xmath42 , one can find that the transition matrix element of the weak current corresponding to @xmath43 or @xmath38 is proportional to the c - number matrix element t@xmath44    @xmath45l_{s',s},\\ ] ]    where @xmath46 @xmath47 is the corresponding current mass of quark , the b - quark space momentum in the dirac spinor of the b - quark has been neglected due to the conclusion ( b ) .",
    "the @xmath48 are the elements of a @xmath49 spin unit matrix .",
    "@xmath50 if b decays to a pseudoscalar meson and @xmath51=@xmath52 if b decays to a vector particle polarized in @xmath53 direction .",
    "a comparison of ( 1 ) with the conventional form factor decomposition@xmath54}$ ] gives some form factor relations@xmath15}$ ] in the heavy - to - light transitions .",
    "for example , for b to pseudoscalar meson via transition @xmath55 one can take @xmath56=0 and find    @xmath57    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is an unknown universal function depending not only on @xmath60 but also on @xmath61 and the flavor of outgoing quarks ( and on @xmath62 ) .    making a comparison between the heavy - to - light and the heavy - to - heavy form factors",
    ", we can see that the main difference between them is that the heavy - to - light transition form factors depend on @xmath61 due to the lack of heavy quark symmetry , while the heavy - to - heavy form factors have nothing to do with the final state particle .",
    "generally the theoretical predictions@xmath15}$ ] from stech s approach are in good agreement with experimental data .    in the following ,",
    "we try to generalize it to the case of baryons .",
    "it is well known that a baryon containing a heavy quark , for example , @xmath24 , can be effectively considered as a bound state of a b - quark and a scalar diquark @xmath63 $ ] with @xmath64 $ ] quantum numbers . in the transition @xmath65 , @xmath2 ( or @xmath3)quark decays into @xmath66 quark and the other part @xmath64 $ ] behaves as spectator .",
    "this decay picture is almost same as that of meson case .",
    "the only difference is that the spectator quark in meson case is replaced by a diquark .",
    "the mass of the @xmath63 $ ] diquark is about several hundred mev . in the light of this picture",
    ", the two basic dynamical assumptions made by stech can be generalized to the baryon case .",
    "it is straightforward to see that the three conclusions mentioned before are still valid now .",
    "@xmath24 and @xmath67 can be represented by dirac spinor @xmath68 and @xmath69 respectively where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are four momentum of @xmath24 and @xmath67 . in the limit @xmath72 , the matrix element of @xmath13",
    "can be written as@xmath14}$ ]    @xmath73     \\gamma_{\\mu}(1-\\gamma_{5})u_{\\lambda_{b}}(v).\\ ] ]    according the generalized stech s approach in the baryon case , this matrix element should be proportional to the following c - number matrix element    @xmath74    a comparison of ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) gives    @xmath75    @xmath76    where @xmath77 is current mass of the s - quark and @xmath78 is energy of @xmath67 in the rest frame of @xmath24 .",
    "for the heavy - to - heavy transition , for instance , @xmath79 , @xmath80 in heavy quark limit , hence @xmath18=0 and @xmath17 is the only form factor , which is in fact the isgur - wise function .",
    "this is consistent with hqet . from ( 6 ) and ( 7 )",
    ", we arrive at the form factor ratio    @xmath81    in the rest frame of @xmath24 , e@xmath82 can be represented by the invariant momentum transfer @xmath83    @xmath84    taking @xmath77=0.15 gev , @xmath85=1.116gev and @xmath86=5.64gev , one finds that e@xmath82 ranges from 1.116gev to 2.93gev and @xmath18/@xmath17 varies from -0.28 to -0.14 , with the q@xmath87 from @xmath88 to @xmath60 = 0 .",
    "similarly , @xmath89 for @xmath90 changes from -0.28 to -0.24 .",
    "this is in good agreement with experimental value ( @xmath91 ) measured recently by cleo@xmath92}$ ] .",
    "in last section eq . (",
    "8) provides a relation between @xmath17 and @xmath18 . to determine them",
    "absolutely , we prepare to use model adopted by guo and kroll@xmath93}$ ] where they worked in the infinite momentum frame ( ifm ) which is arrived at by boosting along the 3-direction ( with @xmath94 ) from a frame with opposite velocities : @xmath95 = @xmath96 ; @xmath97 = @xmath98 , the ifm momenta of @xmath24 and @xmath67 read , respectively ,    @xmath99    @xmath100    a heavy baryon @xmath101 or @xmath102 is regarded as a relativistic bound state of a heavy q ( @xmath2 or @xmath3 ) of mass @xmath12 and a scalar diquark @xmath63 $ ] ,    @xmath103    where color indices have been omitted , @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the imf energies of the heavy quark and scalar - particle , respectively , @xmath106 represses the helicity of the baryon .",
    "state normalization is taken as    @xmath107    which results in the following normalization of the baryon wave function @xmath108    @xmath109    here , the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath110 carried by the heavy quark and the heavy quark s transverse momentum corresponding to its parent baryon @xmath111 are introduced . obviously , the scalar - particle[ud ] carries @xmath112 and -@xmath111 .",

    "this is almost the constituent mass of the diquark .",
    "another parameter b in the wave function is related to the mean @xmath116 or the radius of the baryon and its precise value is not known .",
    "however , we expect the radius of a heavy baryon to be smaller than that of proton . in the following calculations , as in ref . [ 8 ]",
    ", we use b=1.77gev and b=1.18 gev , corresponding to @xmath117@xmath118 = 400 mev and @xmath117@xmath118 = 600mev respectively .",
    "the wave function overlap integral for @xmath17 and @xmath18 can be easily obtained by the matrix elements of the so - call good current components ( @xmath119 )    @xmath120    where @xmath121 is the overlap integral    @xmath122    here @xmath123 represents the unit vector in @xmath124 direction , the occurrence of the parameter @xmath125 is because that @xmath67 has to be considered as a superposition of various quark - diquark configuration@xmath126}$ ] but can not be regarded as being made just of a strang quark and a quasi - particle@xmath64 $ ] . however , in our case , only the @xmath127 $ ] state can contribute to @xmath13 decay and thus the overlap integral is suppressed by an appropriate clebsch - gordan coefficient c@xmath128 which is 1/@xmath129 in the model of [ 12 ] .",
