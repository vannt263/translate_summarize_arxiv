    "entanglement sudden death for bipartite and multipartite systems has been the main focus of researchers during recent years [ 6 - 11 ] .",
    "another important feature , entanglement sudden birth ( esb ) has also been investigated where the initially unentangled qubits can be entangled after a finite evolution of time [ 12 - 13 ] .",
    "recently , entanglement behavior in non - inertial frames was investigated by alsing et al . [ 14 ] .",
    "they studied the fidelity of teleportation between relative accelerated partners .",
    "quantum information in a relativistic setup has become an interesting topic of research during recent years [ 15 - 27 ] .    since",
    ", quantum systems are influenced by their environment that may results in the non - unitary dynamics of the system .",
    "therefore , the environmental effect on a quantum system gives rise to the phenomenon of decoherence that causes an irreversible transfer of information from the system to the environment [ 28 - 29 ] .",
    "study of decoherence in non - inertial frames have been investigated for bipartite and multipartite systems by number of authors [ 30 - 33 ] , where it is shown that entanglement is degraded by the acceleration of the inertial observers .",
    "recently , a qubit - qutrit system in non - inertial frames has been analyzed under decoherence [ 34 ] , where it is shown that esb does occur in case of depolarizing channel .",
    "on the other hand , quantum channels with memory [ 35 - 39 ] provide a natural theoretical framework for the study of any noisy quantum communication .",
    "the main focus of this work is to study the entanglement dynamics in the presence of correlated noise as it has not been studied yet in non - inertial frames .    in this paper , decoherence and correlated noise effects",
    "are investigated for @xmath0-type states in non - inertial frames by considering using amplitude damping , depolarizing and bit flip channels .",
    "the two observers alice and rob share an @xmath0-type state in non - inertial frames .",
    "alice is considered to be stationary whereas rob moves with a uniform acceleration .",
    "two important features of entanglement , esd and esb are investigated .",
    "no esd occurs in case of depolarizing channel in the presence of correlated noise .",
    "the evolution of a system and its environment can be described by @xmath4where @xmath5 represents the evolution operator for the combined system and @xmath6 corresponds to the initial state of the environment . by taking trace over the environmental degrees of freedom ,",
    "the evolution of the system can be obtained as@xmath7where @xmath8 represents the orthogonal basis of the environment and @xmath9 is the operator describing the evolution of the system .",
    "the above equation can also be written as@xmath10where @xmath11 are the kraus operators as given in ref . [",
    "the kraus operators satisfy the completeness relation@xmath12the decoherence process can also be represented by a map in terms of the complete system - environment state .",
    "the dynamics of a @xmath13-dimensional quantum system can be represented by the following map [ 41]@xmath14where @xmath15 @xmath16 is the complete basis for the system and@xmath17    let alice and rob ( the accelerated observer ) share the following @xmath0-type initial state@xmath18where @xmath19 is the identity operator in a two - qubit hilbert space , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the pauli operators of the alice s and rob s qubit and @xmath22 @xmath23 are real numbers satisfying the unit trace and positivity conditions of the density operator @xmath24 in order to study the entanglement dynamics , different cases for initial state are considered , for example , the general initial state @xmath25 , the werner initial state @xmath26 , and bell basis state @xmath27 .",
    "let the dirac fields , as shown in refs .",
    "[ 42 , 43 ] , from an inertial perspective , can be described by a superposition of unruh monochromatic modes @xmath28 and @xmath29and@xmath30where @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the acceleration of the observer , @xmath33 is frequency of the dirac particle and @xmath34 is the speed of light in vacuum .",

    "( 8) and ( 9 ) , equation ( 7 ) can be re - written in terms of minkowski modes for alice ( @xmath37 ) and rindler modes for rob @xmath38 .",
    "the single - mode approximation is used in this study , i.e. a plane wave minkowski mode is assumed to be the same as a plane wave unruh mode ( superposition of minkowski plane waves with single - mode transformation to rindler modes ) . therefore , alice being an inertial observer while her partner rob who is in uniform acceleration , are considered to carry their detectors sensitive to the @xmath33 mode . to study the entanglement in the state from their perspective",
    "one must transform the unruh modes to rindler modes .",
    "hence , unruh states must be transformed into the rindler basis .",
    "let rob detects a single unruh mode and alice detects a monochromatic minkowski mode of the dirac field .",
    "considering that an accelerated observer in rindler region @xmath35 has no access to the field modes in the causally disconnected region @xmath36 and by taking the trace over the inaccessible modes , one obtains the following density matrix@xmath39where @xmath40 and @xmath41    since noise is a major hurdle while transmitting quantum information from one party to other through classical and quantum channels .",
    "this noise causes a distortion of the information sent through the channel .",
    "it is considered that the system is strongly correlated quantum system , the correlation of which results from the memory of the channel itself .",
    "the action of a pauli channel with partial memory on a two qubit state can be written in kraus operator formalism as [ 35]@xmath42}\\sigma _ { i}\\otimes \\sigma _ { j}\\]]where @xmath43 ( @xmath44 are usual pauli matrices , @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) represent the decoherence parameter and indices @xmath47 and @xmath48 runs from @xmath49 to @xmath50 the above expression means that with probability @xmath51 the channel acts on the second qubit with the same error operator as on the first qubit , and with probability @xmath52 it acts on the second qubit independently",
    ". physically the parameter @xmath53 is determined by the relaxation time of the channel when a qubit passes through it .",
    "the action of a two qubit pauli channel when both the qubits of alice and rob are streamed through it , can be described in operator sum representation as [ 46 ] @xmath54where @xmath55 represents the initial density matrix for quantum state and @xmath56  are the kraus operators as expressed in equation ( 11 ) .",
    "a detailed list of single qubit kraus operators for different quantum channels with uncorrelated noise is given in table 1 .",

    "the kraus operators are of dimension @xmath62 and are constructed from single qubit kraus operators by taking their tensor product over all @xmath63 combinations @xmath64where @xmath47 is the number of kraus operator for a single qubit channel .",
    "the final state of the system after the action of the channel can be obtained as @xmath65where @xmath66 is the super - operator realizing the quantum channel parametrized by real numbers @xmath2 and @xmath51 . since , the entanglement dynamics of the bipartite subsystems ( especially the system - environment dynamics ) is of interest here , therefore , only bipartite reduced matrices are considered .",
    "it is assumed that both alice and rob s qubits are influenced by the time correlated environment .",
    "the entanglement of a two - qubit mixed state @xmath67 in a noisy environment can be quantified by the concurrence as defined by [ 45]@xmath68where @xmath69 are the square roots of the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath70 with @xmath71 being the spin flip matrix of @xmath72 and is given by@xmath73where @xmath74 is the usual pauli matrix .",
    "since the density matrix under consideration has @xmath0-type structure , therefore a simpler expression for the concurrence [ 46 ] can be used@xmath75where @xmath76 and @xmath77 the reduced - density matrix of the inertial subsystem @xmath37 and the non - inertial subsystem @xmath78 , can be obtained by taking the partial trace of @xmath79  over the degrees of freedom of the environment i.e. @xmath80which yields the concurrence for the @xmath0-state structure using equation ( 20 ) , under amplitude damping channel as@xmath81the concurrence of @xmath0-state system in case of depolarizing channel becomes@xmath82and the concurrence of the @xmath0-state system under the influence of bit flip channel reads@xmath83where the super - scripts ad , dep and bf correspond to amplitude damping , depolarizing and bit flip channels respectively .",
    "the results are consistent with refs .",

    "the first panel ( column - wise ) corresponds to bell states , whereas the second and third panels correspond to werner and general initial states , respectively .",
    "it is seen that for bell basis states , entanglement sudden death can be avoided in case of amplitude damping and depolarizing channels in the presence of correlated noise .",
    "however , it is possible to fully avoid esd for all the channels under consideration for @xmath1 ( which can be seen from the figure ) . on the other hand",
    ", esd can also be avoided for werner and general initial states as well in case of amplitude damping channel at higher degree of correlations . as the value of acceleration @xmath88 increases@xmath89 the entanglement degradation",
    "is enhanced which is more prominent for lower range of memory parameter @xmath51 .",
    "it is also seen that bit - flip noise heavily influences the entanglement of the system as compared to the amplitude damping and depolarizing channels for lower level of decoherence . whereas at higher level of decoherence , damping effect of amplitude damping channel becomes more prominent ( see figure 2 ) .",

    "furthermore , no esd behaviour is seen for depolarizing channel in the presence of correlated noise .",
    "the degree of entanglement degradation enhances as one shifts from bell type initial state to the case of general initial state .",
    "however , it saturates for infinite acceleration limit @xmath93 .    in figures 4 and 5 ,",

    ", it can be seen that esd can be fully avoided for all the three types of initial states under depolarizing and bit flip noises at 50% quantum correlations . on the other hand ,",
    "esd behaviour is seen only in case of amplitude damping channel for @xmath96 .",
