    "recent measurements of the cosmic ray average logarithmic mass and all - particle spectrum around @xmath1  ev  @xcite give new clues to understand the origin of the cosmic rays and in particular the puzzle of the knee in the energy spectrum .",
    "analysis of such data in a coherent theoretical framework is a rough task , and even if much progress has been done both in theoretical and experimental sides , none of the models proposed so far to solve this problem has been unanimously accepted .",
    "the highest energy particles are almost certainly extragalactic .",
    "a similar origin is not excluded near the knee , but it is difficult to account for the observed continuity of the spectrum in this region  @xcite . as a consequence , the intermediate region between @xmath1 and @xmath4  ev",
    "should be analysed in terms of the same physical mechanisms than lower energy particles .",
    "there are at least three explanations for the knee : ( i ) a change in propagation parameters ( diffusive regime ) , ( ii ) a change in the source regime , ( iii ) a change related to the properties of high energy interactions in the atmosphere or a subtle combination of all three .",
    "as schatz  @xcite emphasized recently , the fine structure of the knee in all - particle spectra provided by extensive air showers can help to discriminate between these solutions .",
    "furthermore , recent data from collider seem to show no drastic departure from cross sections predictions in the range 100    1000  tev  @xcite . anyway",
    ", this paper will only concentrate on astrophysical aspects .",
    "more information can be obtained by measuring @xmath2 .",
    "all - particle spectrum and @xmath2 are given by linear combination of the individual fluxes with different weights ; @xmath5 and @xmath6 therefore they provide different information of these fluxes .",
    "obviously , these weighted quantities are not very useful at  low energy \" where all nuclei are well resolved in satellite or balloon experiments ( for a compilation of data , see  @xcite ) .",
    "experimental difficulties arise around and above the knee : fluxes are very low ( @xmath7 m@xmath8 sr@xmath9 yr@xmath9 ) and large ground array detectors are needed to collect unresolved events with a good statistic .",
    "incidently , the all - particle spectrum can be extracted _ via _ shower parameters ( _ e.g. _ core position , direction , ... ) and an estimation of the average logarithmic mass is also possible through various methods ( _ e.g _  @xcite and in particular  @xcite ) . a new experimental technique has been recently proposed , which can potentially yield excellent charge resolution measurements near and above the knee  @xcite .",
    "but at the present time , even if a few solutions exist to infer the composition  @xcite , all - particle flux , mean logarithmic mass and sometimes proton and helium spectra  @xcite are grossly the only available observables near and above the knee ( for a detailed revue , see  @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : ( i ) features of primary species propagated in diffusion model are reminded ; ( ii ) simple models are used to explore the behaviour of @xmath2 considering separately the effect of three parameters ( source spectra , propagation , geometrical aspects ) ; ( iii ) the results of these simplified models are analysed ; ( iv ) using a more realistic simulation , the three parameters are discussed in details , and ( v ) all these parameters are included in the propagation model of maurin et al .",
    "@xcite and are finally combined to analyze the knee problem .",
    "for practical reasons , spectra at low energy are almost always displayed in units of kinetic energy per nucleon , because this quantity is conserved in nuclear reactions .",
    "this convention has become the rule in the analysis of cosmic ray propagation , _ e.g. _ secondary to primary ratio studies . above pev energies ,",
    "fluxes are plotted _ vs _ energy per particle because it is the only observable provided by ground observatories .",
    "whereas various primary species present similar spectra when plotted versus kinetic energy per nucleon or rigidity , they behave differently in terms of total energy ( compare for example fig .",
    "5-a of  @xcite that displays fluxes in units of kinetic energy per nucleon and fig .  2 of  @xcite that shows the same fluxes , but in units of total energy )",
    "; so a combination of all the corresponding spectra into a single quantity ( for example the average logarithmic mass ) will provide a different dependence in terms of total energy or in terms of rigidity .",
    "although cosmic ray properties are well understood up to a few hundreds of gev / nuc ( see the recent review of  @xcite ) , it is difficult to harmonize all the observables ( _ i.e. _ protons , nuclei , e@xmath10 , e@xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 rays ; see for instance  @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the hypothesis according to which the fluxes measured locally are representative of the fluxes present everywhere in the galaxy is still debated . at intermediate energies ,",
    "extension of the usual propagation models has mainly to face the problem that the observed anisotropy is very low .",
    "this seems to favor a kolmogorov spectrum ( interstellar turbulence ) associated to the rigidity dependence of the diffusion coefficient ( see discussion in  @xcite ) .",
    "cosmic ray spectra are affected by the propagation process .",
    "maurin et al .",
    "@xcite have recently developed a propagation model ( see sec .",
    "[ propagation_prescription ] for details ) that is in principle valid for a wide energetic range as long as charged nuclei are considered .",
    "this is a two zones model ( thin gazeous disc  half - height @xmath14 pc  and large diffusive halo @xmath15 kpc ) where cylindrical symmetry is assumed ( radial extension , @xmath16 kpc ) .",
    "the steady  state differential density @xmath17 of the nucleus @xmath18 as a function of energy @xmath19 and position @xmath20 in this model is given by @xmath21 @xmath22 the operator @xmath23 represents convection ( @xmath24 ) plus spatial diffusion ( @xmath25 ) acting in the whole box .",
    "all other terms describe processes localized in the thin gazeous disc only : the bracket corresponds to primary source term , secondary spallative production from heavier nuclei , and destruction cross section ( radioactive - induced processes have been omitted here ) .",
    "curly bracket provides all terms leading to energetic redistribution , _",
    "i.e _ losses ( coulombian , ionisation and adiabatic expension losses ) and gains ( reacceleration ) described by two effective parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( for all details , see  @xcite )",
    ".    in the leaky box model , widely used , all the quantities are spatially averaged .",
    "the diffusion - convection term is then replaced by an effective escape term which has the meaning of a residence time @xmath28 ( @xmath29 myr at a few gev / nuc ) in the confinement volume ( @xmath30 ) . if energy gains and losses are discarded , the leaky box equation reads @xmath31 as an immediate consequence , leaky box models do not allow to take in consideration , for example , a radial dependence of galactic sources .",
    "more generally , any subtle effect related with spatial dependence of any terms of the diffusion - convection equation is automatically swept away .     and",
    "slope @xmath32   , halo size @xmath33 , convection @xmath24 , reacceleration @xmath34 ) are taken from  @xcite .",
    "other curves correspond to the same propagation parameters , except one that has been switched off . , scaledwidth=90.0% ]    figure  [ fe ] displays the iron flux as a function of kinetic energy per nucleon in our diffusion - convection model ; this behaviour is standard for all charged nuclei except protons , for which propagation is less sensitive to nuclear reactions . within realistic propagation models ,",
    "several parameters affect the primeval power law source spectrum :    * the most spectacular effect is that of inelastic interactions ( nuclear destruction ) .",
    "it becomes negligible ( @xmath35 a few % ) between 1  tev / nuc and 10  tev / nuc , depending on the species , since the escape time is shorter than the nuclear time .",
    "* the spectrum is also affected by energy losses up to @xmath36  gev / nuc .",
    "* more controversial effects may be present : galactic wind up to 1  tev / nuc and reacceleration up to some tens of gev / nuc .",
    "propagation effects are present up to 10  tev / nuc .",
    "this induces modifications of spectra up of a few hundreds tev in total energy , at least for heavier nuclei ( _ i.e. _ fe ) leading in turn to a dependence on energy of the average logarithmic mass till these higher energies , _",
    "i.e. _ near the knee ( @xmath7  pev ) .",
    "since current high energy data are provided in total energy per particle , all results will be given in total energy ( denoted @xmath19 ) unless stated otherwise .",
    "solar modulation is ignored because it has almost no effect on fluxes above a few tens of gev / nuc .",
    "three items ( source spectra , propagation and geometrical effects ) are pieces of the cosmic ray puzzle . in this section ,",
    "we introduce simplified models where only two species are considered ( _ e.g. _ h and fe ) that allow to analyze qualitatively the increase of the mean mass of cosmic rays with energy .      in the simplest propagation model that one can imagine , pure diffusion is considered and only two ingredients are necessary : @xmath37 @xmath38 in the above expressions , @xmath39 is the rigidity , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are respectively the source abundance and the spectral index of nucleus @xmath18 , @xmath42 is the normalization coefficient of the diffusion coefficient and @xmath32 its slope ( both are assumed independent of the species considered ) . the detected local flux ( in arbitrary units )",
    "is thus expressed merely as the ratio of sources over the diffusion coefficient ( up to a coefficient @xmath43 for all nuclei ) : @xmath44 this model can be viewed as the high energy limit of all diffusion models .",
    "this limit is also that of a locally equivalent leaky box model , where once emitted , the nucleus can escape from the confinement box with a probability which is related very simply to @xmath45   see for example  @xcite and references therein .      in a two nuclei model ,",
    "the evaluation of the fe / p ratio and the average logarithmic mass number    average mass \" for short   is straightforward . at a given energy ,",
    "the rigidities of two charged nuclei are different .",
    "indeed , the term @xmath45 ca nt be simply factorized , and some residual multiplicative constant depending on @xmath32 appears .",
    "using the approximate relation @xmath46 ( e is the total energy per particle ) which is correct beyond a few tens of a  gev , we have @xmath47 where the first term corresponds to the relative source abundance fe / p taken at the energy 100  gev , which is @xmath48 ( see fig .  2 of compilation of  @xcite ) .",
    "apart from numerical constant , we roughly see that the steeper @xmath49 effective slope , the greater will be the average mass . to be more precise , @xmath50_{\\rm 100~gev }          \\times ( e/100 { \\rm~gev})^{-\\alpha_{\\rm p}+\\alpha_{\\rm fe}}\\right ) } \\label{pure_index}\\ ] ] whereas in terms of the all - particle spectrum , the evolution   up to a normalization   can be written as @xmath51_{\\rm 100~gev }          \\times \\left(\\frac{e}{100 { \\rm~gev}}\\right)^{-\\alpha_{\\rm p}+          \\alpha_{\\rm fe}}\\right)\\;. \\label{pure_index_all_particle}\\ ] ] we remark that in our simple two species model , @xmath52 ; the behaviour of all - particles spectrum will be discussed in sec .  [ gfdsa ] .      among the various acceleration models , some of them are able to produce various spectra for different nuclei  ( see sec .",
    "[ biermanie ] ) .",
    "the maximal source effect is obviously obtained when @xmath53 is maximal . for typical values @xmath54 such as those advocated by the wind / ism supernovae model of biermann and collaborators  @xcite , and with the above value @xmath55_{\\rm 100 gev}\\sim 20 $ ]",
    ", we obtain @xmath56 indeed , the evolution is expected to be smoother when all cosmic ray nuclei are considered , because the slopes of nuclei heavier than hydrogen are similar ( see sec .  [ biermanie ] ) ; but this sole effect leads to an evolution of the average mass .",
    "incidently , if @xmath57 , we are left with a constant @xmath58 that merely depends on the relative abundances of nuclei .",
    "this conclusion holds again when several nuclei are considered .      the process of inelastic collisions  which differs from one nucleus to another  has a major impact on propagation ( see fig",
    ".  [ fe ] ) . to obtain order of magnitude estimates ,",
    "a simple leaky box description including just destruction cross sections is sufficient .",
    "thus , the propagated flux for a primary species @xmath18 is : @xmath59 here @xmath60 is the total inelastic ( or reaction ) cross section of species @xmath18 , and @xmath61 is the usual escape length of the leaky box in g cm@xmath8 and @xmath63 is the mean mass of the atoms in the interstellar medium .",
    "this can also be rewritten in terms of an effective escape cross section @xmath64 ( in @xmath65 ) that is related to the usual grammage by a simple factor .    under the assumption of the same source spectrum ( _ i.e. _ universal slope @xmath66 for all species ) and since there is no geometry in the leaky box , assuming an escape dependence @xmath67 , _",
    "@xmath68 for all nuclei , we get :    @xmath69^{-1 } \\label{pure_propagation}\\ ] ]    contrary to the previous case , the ratio @xmath70 does not depend on energy .",
    "the typical diffusion coefficient for leaky box models is given for example by  @xcite @xmath71 which corresponds in the above expression to @xmath72 mb .",
    "we have in this model @xmath73 , @xmath74 mb ( particle data group ) , @xmath75 mb  @xcite . in order to compare this effect with the precedent , we set @xmath70 to @xmath76 which gives the same @xmath58 at 100  gev as before .",
    "thus , @xmath77    even near the knee energies , the average mass slightly evolves due to spallations .",
    "it is then clear from formula  ( [ pure_propagation ] ) that the evolution of chemical abundances depends on ( i ) the destruction cross section , ( ii ) the diffusion coefficient slope @xmath32 , as well as other propagation parameters ( see sec .",
    "[ musea ] ) .      in homogeneous diffusion models ( _ e.g. _ leaky box models ) , this would be the final step . in the context of diffusion models ,",
    "the nuclei propagate in a two zones / three dimensional space , and we take into account the gradients of the source number and of the metallicity .",
    "let first assume that spectral source indexes are similar for all accelerated species , and that pure diffusion prevails .",
    "the quantity @xmath78 depends on energy _ via _ the relative abundance @xmath79 .",
    "actually , the source term depends on radial coordinate , and the average distance @xmath80 from which a given species @xmath81 come depends on energy . at a given energy ,",
    "@xmath80 is generally different for two species , implying an indirect dependence of @xmath79 on energy .",
    "moreover , even if these average distances @xmath82 and @xmath83 are equal , the relative abundances may depend on this distance ; this is the _ pure _ metallicity effect . at sufficiently high energy , _",
    "i.e. _ a few tens of tev / nuc , @xmath80 is a constant number that only depends on the size of the diffusive box : no geometrical effects are expected .",
    "we focus on the _ pure _ metallicity effect : forgetting for a while the radial source distribution effect , we suppose that relative distribution of species only depends of their location .",
    "namely , we take a gradient @xmath84\\sim -0.05 $ ] dex kpc@xmath9 , corresponding to an increased metallicity towards the center of the galaxy ( see sec .",
    "[ gradientmetal ] ) .",
    "the sun is located at @xmath85 ( 8.5 kpc ) .",
    "the metallicity gradient is given by : @xmath86=-0.05\\ : ( r - r_{\\odot } ) \\equiv \\log \\left(q_{\\rm fe}/q_{\\rm p}\\right)^{\\rm eff } -\\log ( { \\rm fe}/{\\rm h})_{\\odot}\\ ] ] leading to @xmath87 a rough estimation of the @xmath88 dependent term above can be obtained as follows : at high energy , cosmic ray nuclei can not come farther than the center , _ i.e. _ @xmath89 kpc . at lower energy ( say 100  gev ) , they all come from @xmath90 .",
    "it corresponds to @xmath91    this crude evaluation that overestimates some effects gives us the evolution of the mean mass for the metallicity gradient effect : using eq .",
    "( [ pure_gradient ] ) and assuming once again that at 100  gev , the ratio @xmath92 , we obtain @xmath93 this _ pure _ metallicity effect is small compared to the others .",
    "moreover , as cosmic ray sources are distributed in the anticenter ( lower metallicity ) as well as in the center ( higher metallicity ) , we expect a sort of cancelation when both contributions are added .",
    "the same balance is likely to occur for the second geometrical effect .",
    "several qualitative remarks can be made about the relative importance of the various effects .",
    "the metallicity gradient plays an almost negligible role compared to the two others .",
    "pure propagation effect is dominant ( see fig  [ toy_model1 ] , left panel ; right panel shows the two separate effects for the all particle flux ) , but as well as geometrical effects it ceases to act around 100  tev    1  pev ( roughly the knee energy ) .",
    "then , the pure source effect only , _ i.e. _ different @xmath94 for protons and other species ( @xmath95 ) , is able to produce an evolution of the average mass .",
    "this is an important result that validates the approach used in a recent study  @xcite .     for _ pure _ spectrum effect   solid line ( see sec .",
    "[ windism ] ) and _ pure _ propagation effects   dashed line ( see sec .  [ verte ] ) .",
    "right panel : same for all - particle flux ( arbitrary units ) . ]    including all the primaries , we should expect concerning the first effect  pure source spectrum , see eq .",
    "( [ result1 ] )  a smoother evolution , since other primaries show slopes similar to that of iron and mix their effects .",
    "concerning the second effect , a smoothing is also expected since all nuclei are equally dispatched between proton and iron ( from the cross section point of view ) .    to visualise the changes induced by the knee , we display in fig .",
    "[ toy_model2 ] ( for the two previous cases ) three forms for the break in spectra , namely a break at @xmath1  ev either in total energy , or rigidity or energy per nucleus .",
    "concerning @xmath96 , we see that the evolution from lighter to heavier nuclei at the knee is more important if the slope of hydrogen and other nuclei are the same below the knee .",
    "if not the case , we see in particular that the farthest the break occurs , the smoother is the bump in @xmath96 ( compare dot line   @xmath97  ev   to solid line  ",
    "@xmath98  ev ) . for each model , we have after the knee a constant composition related to the fact that all nuclei have now the same slope . concerning the all - particle spectrum , we see that , except for the situation where the break is energy dependent , there is a smooth evolution on about one decade before reaching the definitive slope .",
    "a first break occurs when protons change slope , and the second when fe does .",
    "the situations where @xmath99  ev or @xmath100  ev are quite similar , and the difference will be rather difficult to see in data .",
    "note that a change of diffusive regime ( with @xmath101 ) is completely equivalent to the case @xmath102 in source spectra if @xmath103  ev .",
    "this is because at these energies , subtleties of propagation are irrelevant .    , and right panel :",
    "all - particle flux times @xmath104 ( arbitrary units ) .",
    "the various cases correspond to the two effects previously studied ( see fig .",
    "[ toy_model1 ] ) with an additional modeling for the knee . for each curve ( dashed and solid line ) we have from bottom to top a transition @xmath105  ev , @xmath106  ev , and @xmath107  ev . the dot curve in left panel corresponds to the case @xmath108  ev . ]",
    "the maximal energy reached in shocks associated with supernovae is of about @xmath109  ev ( see for instance  @xcite ) .",
    "as the acceleration processes are rigidity dependent , there is a cut  off at z times the maximum energy gained and these models predict an increase of the average mass of primary cosmic rays with total energy .",
    "in fact , the limit @xmath109  ev is close to the knee energy so that another acceleration process must be found for higher energies . to bypass this limit and explain slopes near the knee",
    ", several mechanisms have been proposed ; for example , acceleration by terminal shock of galactic wind  @xcite , by neutron star quakes  @xcite or by pulsars  @xcite , contribution from a single recent local supernova explosion  @xcite , and photodisintegration of nuclei by a background of optical and soft uv photons in the sources  @xcite .",
    "another explanation also has been proposed , based on the extension of supernova acceleration models , but they are contradictory : it is shown in  @xcite that acceleration by multiple spherical shocks in ob associations ( superbubbles ) is not sufficient to reach @xmath110  ev unless extreme values of the turbulence parameters are used .",
    "a different conclusion is drawn in  @xcite , where the authors adjust turbulence parameters to reproduce the data . recently , going back to the problem of the maximal energy gained in sn shocks ,  @xcite showed that non - linear amplifications of the magnetic field by the cosmic rays themselves could push the usual limit to @xmath111  ev , and even a factor ten more if stellar wind pre - exists .",
    "note that this distinction between _ standard _ supernovae and supernova explosions of massive stars in their own wind has been advocated by biermann and collaborators  @xcite as the possible explanation of the knee .",
    "this a is very important argument because it seems that such models produce below the knee different spectra for p and other species .",
    "note that even in usual acceleration models , collective effects can also produce such an effect  @xcite .",
    "the energy of the break and slopes below and above the knee ( denoted @xmath112 and @xmath113 ) are in relative agreement between the various experiments ( see tab .  [ slopes ] ) .",

    "compared to the results of the two components model ( see sec .  [ gfdsa ] ) , we remark both in @xmath0 and @xmath130 some additionnal bifurcations generated by the helium component with a second even smoother transition provided by the cno group . if these effects are not very relevant for the average mass composition , they hamper the interpretation of the transition from one regime to the other in the all - particle spectrum data .",

    "the best clues up to now about the knee puzzle come from spectral analysis : for example the kascade collaboration  @xcite find that the all - particle spectrum exhibits a knee ( @xmath135 ) around 4  pev , but that this knee is seen only in their light ion subsample for which @xmath136 . as regards the heavy ions",

    "several astrophysical effects have been considered and geometrical effects have been found to play a minor role , while propagation effects ( mostly selective destruction in flight of heavy nuclei ) drive this evolution up to the knee where they cease to be effective . a difference between the source spectrum of protons and other ions lead to a constant enhancement of @xmath2 up to the knee and ceases if the slopes above the knee are similar for all species . in the framework of a simple break in rigidity ( or total energy per nucleon ) ,",
