    "moreover , we compared our data with a simple theoretical model and characterized the operation of the individual tess in the previous section .",
    "we stress that our data processing neither needs nor uses any of this information .",
    "our verification of nonclassicality is independent of the theoretical or reconstructed model of the tess and the modeling of the pdc source .",
    "so far , we have studied measurements for a fixed pump power of the pdc process . however , it is known that the purity of the heralded states depends on the squeezing parameter , which is a function of the pump power . for instance , in the limiting case of a vanishing squeezing , we have the optimal approximation of the heralded state to a fock state .",
    "however , the rate of the probabilistic generation of that state converges to zero in the same limit ( appendix [ sec : theoreticalmodel ] ) .",
    "hence , we have additionally generated multi - photon states for different squeezing levels and analyzed their nonclassicality .",

[",
    "fig : a_results - multi ] , we can observe this behavior .",
    "note that the heralding to @xmath195 is not studied as the number of such heralding events is too small for a proper statistical evaluation .",
    "it can be seen in all other parts of fig .",
    "[ fig : a_results - multi ] that @xmath196 influences the significance of our results .",
    "that is , a smaller @xmath196 value naturally implies a larger error .",
    "this holds for increasing the heralding bin @xmath177 as well as for decreasing the pump power .    in the second column in fig .",
    "[ fig : a_results - multi ] , labeled as `` sub - poisson '' , we study the nonclassicality in terms of the criterion @xmath197 as well as @xmath167 and @xmath155 . as we discussed in sec .",

    "compare to eq . .",
    "the third column in fig .",
    "[ fig : a_results - multi ] shows the corresponding concept of `` sub - binomial '' light .",

    "it depicts the certified nonclassicality via the criterion @xmath199 where @xmath200 is a normalized eigenvector to the minimal eigenvalue of @xmath81 .    for all notations of nonclassicality under study ,",
    "the heralding to the @xmath9th bin is consistent with our expectation of a classical state , which also confirms that no fake - nonclassicality is detected . for instance , applying the mandel parameter to the data of this @xmath9th heralded stated without the corrections derived here [ eq . ] , we would observe a negative value ; see also a similar discussion in refs .",
    "the case of a poisson or binomial statistics tend to be above zero , whereas the multinomial case is consistent with the value of zero .",
    "this expectation has been justified below eq . .",
    "a lot of information on the quantum - optical properties of the generated multi - photon ( @xmath201 ) light fields can be concluded from fig .",
    "[ fig : a_results - multi ] .",
    "let us mention some of them by focusing on a comparison .",
    "we have the trend that the notion of sub - poisson light has the least significant nonclassicality .",
    "this is due to the fact that the vector @xmath75 in eq .",
    "assigns a higher contribution to the larger bin numbers .",
    "however , those contributions have lower count numbers , cf . fig .",
    "[ fig : a_coincidences ] , which consequently decreases the statistical significance .",
    "this effect is not present for sub - binomial light , which is described by a more or less balanced weighting of the different counts ; see vector @xmath75 in eq . . however , this vector is still a fixed one .",
    "the optimal vector is naturally computed by the sub - multinomial criterion in eq . .",
    "the quality of the verified nonclassicality is much better than for the other two scenarios of sub - poisson and -binomial light in most of the cases .",
    "let us mention that the normalized eigenvector to the minimal eigenvalue of the sampled matrix @xmath81 typically , but not necessarily yields the minimal propagated error . as outlined earlier , a lower pump power allows for the heralding of a state which is closer to an ideal fock state , which results in higher mean negativities for decreasing pump powers .",
    "however , the heralding efficiency is reduced , which results in a larger error .",
    "this comparative analysis of sub - poisson , -binomial , and -multinomial light from a measurement with a single detection device would not be possible without the technique that has been elaborated in this work .",
    "in summary , we constructed the quantum - optical framework for a multiplexing scheme that employs arbitrary detectors for verifying nonclassicality of multi - photon states .",
    "we formulated the theory of such a detection layout together with nonclassicality tests .",
    "further , we set up an experimental realization and applied our technique to the data .    in a first step ,",
    "the theory was formulated .",
    "we proved that the measured click - counting statistics of the a scheme under study is always described by a quantum version of the multinomial statistics .",
    "indeed , for classical light , this probability distribution can be considered as a mixture of multinomial statistics .",
    "this bounds the minimal amount of fluctuations which can be observed for classical radiation fields .",
    "more precisely , the matrix of normally ordered moments , which can be directly sampled from data , is lower bounded by zero . as a particular example",
    ", the violation of this classical constraint was discussed for the second - order covariance matrix and it led to establishing the concept of sub - multinomial light .",
    "previous notions of nonclassicality , i.e , sub - poisson and sub - binomial light , can be considered to be special cases of our general nonclassicality criteria .    in our second part , the experiment was analyzed .",
    "our source produces correlated photon pairs by a parametric - down - conversion process . a heralding to the outcome of a detection of the idler photons with a transition - edge sensor produced multi - photon states in the signal beam .",
    "a single multiplexing step was implemented with a subsequent detection by two transition - edge sensors to probe the signal field .",
    "the complex function of these detectors was discussed by demonstrating their nonlinear response to the number of incident photons .",
    "consequently , without worrying about this unfavorable feature , we applied our detector - independent nonclassicality criteria to our data .",
    "we verified the nonclassical character of the produced quantum light .",
    "the criterion of sub - multinomial light was shown to outperform its poisson and binomial counterparts to the greatest possible extend .",
    "in conclusion , we presented a detailed and more extend study of our approach in ref .",
    "we generalized the nonclassicality tests to include higher - order correlations which become more and more accessible with an increasing number of multiplexing steps .",
    "in addition , details of our data analysis and a simple theoretical model were considered .",
