    "dwarf novae are a class of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , which are close binary systems consisting of a white dwarf and a red dwarf secondary transferring matter via the roche - lobe overflow .",
    "wz sge - type dwarf novae ( cf .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) are a small subgroup of dwarf novae characterized by the long ( @xmath1 10 yr ) outburst recurrence time and the large ( @xmath1 8 mag ) outburst amplitude .",
    "they are a subclass of su uma - type dwarf novae ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the most remarkable signature of wz sge - type outbursts is the presence of  early superhumps \" during their earliest stage of superoutbursts .",
    "early superhumps have a period extremely close to that of the binary period , and commonly show double - humped profile ( figure [ fig : ecomp ] ; see also @xcite and @xcite for detailed discussions ) , in contrast to ordinary superhumps of su uma - type dwarf novae [ see @xcite for basic properties of su uma - type dwarf novae ] .",
    "early superhumps are the most discriminative feature of wz sge - type outbursts , and have not been detected in other dwarf novae ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "although several models have been historically proposed [ e.g. enhanced hot spot @xcite , immature form of superhumps @xcite , jet or thickened disk @xcite ] , none of them has successfully explained all the observed features of early superhumps .",
    "during the early stage of the 2001 outburst of wz sge ( e.g. @xcite ) , several authors ( @xcite ; @xcite ) detected two - armed arch - like structures on doppler tomograms@xcite of heii and ciii / niii emission lines .",
    "the feature resembled those of ` spiral structure ' seen on doppler tomograms of the dwarf nova ip peg ( @xcite ; @xcite ) in outburst .",
    "the spiral structure in doppler tomograms of ip peg has been widely believed to represent tidally induced spiral shocks or spiral waves @xcite .",
    "however , it is not clear whether the same interpretation can apply to a completely different ( very low mass - ratio , @xmath2 in contrast to @xmath3 in ip peg , and very low - mass transfer rate , several orders of magnitudes lower than that of ip peg ) binary parameters of wz sge .    at the epoch of the detection of two - armed arch - like structures in wz sge ,",
    "the star showed double - wave early superhumps @xcite .",
    "although there have been suggestions that early superhumps in photometry and two - armed structures on doppler tomograms have the same origin ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , no promising idea has been proposed to explain these features in the same scheme .",
    "most recently , an alternative idea has been proposed to explain arch - like structures in the outbursting ip peg disk , by considering the irradiation of the elevated disk formed by the horizontal convergence ( @xmath4 ) of three - body orbits @xcite .",
    "this interpretation successfully reproduced the arch - like structures , and the observed strong intensity in the region of ( @xmath5 ) , which is difficult to explain within the scheme of conventional tidally induced spiral shocks .",
    "@xcite studied tidal distortion of fluid disks , and succeeded in reproducing the basically same features .",
    "@xcite showed , in realistic fluid disks , that @xmath6 inner vertical resonance play a more important role even in high @xmath0 binaries .",
    "( 60mm,60mm)str3.eps ( 50mm,60mm)wz24.eps + ( 60mm,100mm)ste2.eps ( 50mm,60mm)wz28b.eps",
    "in low @xmath0 systems like wz sge , tidal force of the secondary is so weak on a compact disk that a condition is usually achieved that angular momentum is more effectively transported by viscosity than tidal force of the secondary @xcite .",
    "however , during the early stage of vigorous outbursts of wz sge - type stars , the disk can sufficiently expand @xcite . in usual su uma - type dwarf novae ,",
    "the growth of 3:1 resonance , which is responsible of superhumps ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , is rapid enough to effectively truncate the disk at the resonance radius . in low @xmath0 wz sge - type stars , the slow growth [ the growth rate being proportional to @xmath7 @xcite ] can allow the disk to expand beyond the 3:1 resonance .",
    "in such a condition , tidal distortion of the outer edge of the accretion disk , as proposed by @xcite and @xcite , can effectively work , as shown in figure 3 , @xmath0=0.1 case of @xcite .",
    "this effect is predominant in the outer edge of the accretion disk , which can explain stronger and distorted emission lines in low velocity regions ( e.g. @xcite ) . since high - excitation emission lines like heii require a high temperature ( @xmath1 25000 k ) , the concentration of emission lines and arch - like patterns in low velocity regions is otherwise difficult to explain @xcite .",
    "the arch - like pattern in doppler tomograms in wz sge is also stronger in the region of ( @xmath5 ) , which also can be naturally explained as a result of stronger tides near the secondary , as in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the maximum phases of early superhumps have been also problematic .",
    "early superhumps in wz sge - type dwarf novae consist of two maxima of different amplitudes ( figure [ fig : ecomp ] ) . in wz sge ,",
    "the brighter maximum is around binary phase 0.60.7 @xcite . while models involving an enhanced hot spot as in @xcite would require such a maximum corresponding to the orbital phase of a stronger emission feature , the available observation shows a complete phase reversal ( figure [ fig : dopcompare ] ) .",
    "such a reversal can be naturally understood if one considers the source of emission lines and stronger continuum is an irradiated surface ( @xcite ; @xcite ) of the accretion disk .",
    "[ since cvs are known to emit most of their energy in the uv wavelengths ( e.g. @xcite ) , re - emission of a small fraction of intercepted uv photons in the optical wavelengths is expected to explain the observed amplitudes of continuum variation ( early superhumps ) ] .",
    "the decrease in amplitude of early superhumps in accordance with the fading of the outburst ( e.g. @xcite ) can be also naturally understood as an effect of shrinkage of the disk , resulting in decreasing tidal effects .",
    "@xcite also showed that the exact period of early superhumps is very slightly ( 0.05% ) shorter than the orbital period .",
    "this effect was observed as a phase - shift of maxima of early superhumps .",
    "this change looks likely to correspond to a counterclockwise rotation of the patterns on doppler tomograms at different epochs ( figure [ fig : dopcompare ] ) .",
    "the rotation of patterns may reflect the variation of the direction of the ` maximum height distortion ' toward a smaller disk radius ( see figure 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "further detailed calculations of a time - evolution of the outbursting wz sge disk would provide a stringest test to this interpretation .    most recently , @xcite explained early superhumps ( which they call _ early humps _ ) by considering the manifestation of the tidal 2:1 resonance in accretion disks of binary systems with extremely low mass ratios .",
    "the present interpretation is different from that of @xcite in its basic mechanism : @xcite requires tidal _ dissipation _ while the present interpretation only requires tidal _ distortion _ of a steady flow ( hence it does not require a shock ) .",
    "the present interpretation has an advantage over all existing models in its simplicity of the assumed physics and in that it can also explain two - armed distortion patterns on doppler tomograms as well as photometric signals .",
    "the reason why such features are only observed in wz sge - type stars can be explained as a combination of the large stored mass in quiescence @xcite and the delayed exertion of the 3:1 resonance , which is only reasonably achieved in extremely low @xmath0 and low mass - transfer rate ( and presumably low quiescent viscosity ) systems as in wz sge - type stars .",
    "since three - dimensional fluid calculation by @xcite showed that @xmath6 inner vertical resonance can effectively work in relatively high @xmath0 systems , we can expect similar phenomena expected in @xcite in larger @xmath0 systems , which can not hold particle orbits of the 2:1 resonance within the roche lobe .",
    "although @xcite also presented an idea of distinguishing wz sge - type stars from other cvs based on resonances involved , the present interpretation is different from that of @xcite in that @xcite only considered resonances in _ paczynski type _ orbits ( e.g. @xcite ) , while the present interpretation involves the three - dimensional effect as presented by @xcite .",
    "the appearance of early superhumps and the reproduction of wz sge - type outburst in rz leo @xcite , a binary with @xmath8 , which is approximately twice larger than those of other known wz sge - type stars , can be understood as one of the most distinct consequences between the present interpretation and that of @xcite .",
