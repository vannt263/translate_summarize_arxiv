    "perovskite compounds @xmath4o@xmath0 , with @xmath5 being an alkali , alkaline earth or rare earth metal and @xmath6 a transition metal element , attract much attention because of their importance both for fundamental science and for technological applications @xcite .",
    "although the high - temperature cubic phase has a very simple crystal structure , this does not prevent these compounds to exhibit a large variety of physical properties rendering the perovskites to model compounds for studies of a large variety of different physical phenomena . within the perovskite family , we find superconductivity , e.g. in k@xmath7ba@xmath8bio@xmath9 @xcite , giant magnetoresistance , e.g. in lamno@xmath9 @xcite , orbital ordering , e.g. in ytio@xmath9 @xcite and ferroelectricity , e.g. in batio@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the latter phenomena are of large interest because of technological applications .    the compounds srtio@xmath0 ( sto ) and batio@xmath0 ( bto ) are usually considered to be isovalent .",
    "the valence and conduction bands of the two perovskites are formed by @xmath1-states of oxygen and @xmath2-states of titanium . in the high - temperature cubic phase ,",
    "the ti and o sub - lattices have the identical geometry for sto and bto , the lattice parameters being @xmath10=3.8996   @xcite and @xmath10=4.009  ",
    "@xcite respectively . as the temperature lowers , both compounds experience a softening of an optical phonon mode , which corresponds to ti motion towards the oxygen @xcite .",
    "bto exhibits a succession of phase transitions , from the high - temperature cubic perovskite phase to ferroelectric structures with tetragonal , orthorhombic and rhombohedral symmetry @xcite .",
    "in contrast , sto behaves as an incipient ferroelectric in the sense that it remains paraelectric down to the lowest temperatures , exhibiting nevertheless a very large static dielectric response .",
    "it undergoes an antiferrodistortive phase transition at 105  k to a tetragonal ( @xmath11 ) phase , but this transition is of non - polar character and has little influence on the dielectric properties@xcite .",
    "the first determination of the @xmath12o electric field gradient ( efg ) on the oxygen site in perovskites was recently reported for sto and bto @xcite together with first - principle calculations using the linearized augmented plane wave ( lapw ) method was used .",
    "the most striking feature in the experimental and theoretical data is the large difference of the efgs between the two compounds .",
    "the calculational investigation of blinc _ et al .",
    "_ concluded , that the magnitude of the efg of @xmath12o in bto is larger than the efg of @xmath12o in sto due to two effects : @xmath13 larger lattice parameters in bto compared to sto and @xmath14 a larger ionic radius of ba compared to sr . while the experimental determination ( nmr ) can not provide the sign of the efg , the lapw calculation yielded a negative efg .",
    "a negative efg corresponds to a prolate electron density , which implies the importance of covalence effects .    in order to elucidate the origin of the sign of and the different contributions to the efg",
    ", we have performed first - principle calculations using a local orbital code ( fplo @xcite ) that is especially suited to address these questions due to its representation of the potential and the density allowing easy decomposition .",
    "the calculational details of our investigation are given in sec .",
    "[ calmeth ] , and the obtained results are presented in sec .  [ far ] .",
    "these results can not be explained by intuitive models , which are also described in this section .",
    "therefore , a more complex microscopic model hamiltonian is introduced in sec .",
    "[ disc ] . using the properties of this @xmath1-@xmath2 like hamiltonian , an agreement with the obtained experimental and theoretical results and a deeper",
    ", microscopically based understanding is obtained .",
    "the electronic band structure calculations were performed with the full - potential local - orbital minimum basis code fplo ( version 5.00 - 19 ) @xcite within the local density approximation . in the scalar relativistic calculations the exchange and correlation potential of perdew and wang @xcite was employed . as basis sets ba ( 4d5s5p/6s6p5d+4f7s7p ) ,",
    "sr ( 4s4p/5s5p4d+6s6p ) , ti ( 3s3p3d/4s4p4d+5s5p ) and o ( 2s2p3d+3s3p ) were chosen for semicore / valence+polarization states .",
    "the high lying states improve the completeness of the basis which is especially important for accurate efg calculations .",
    "the lower lying states were treated fully relativistic as core states . a well converged @xmath15-mesh of 455 @xmath15-points was used in the irreducible part of the brillouin zone .",
    ".the experimental and calculated values of the efg ( in 10@xmath16 v / m@xmath17 ) on the oxygen site in the cubic phase of the two perovskites .",
    "the last four lines refer to equations given in the appendix . [ cols=\"^,>,>,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      in the we model",
    ", we use @xmath18 as model parameter , hence @xmath19 , and in the harrison model , we use @xmath20 as model parameter , hence @xmath21 .",
    "however . there is some contribution of the cf acting on the e.g. @xmath1-states at the @xmath22 point : the interactions with sr states , with core states , with madelung potentials etc .",
    "therefore , @xmath23 is rather a model parameter than the true atomic energy , @xmath24 , of a @xmath25 state .",
    "if we speak about the model only , we may drop @xmath24 and @xmath26 , and retain only @xmath23 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 ."
