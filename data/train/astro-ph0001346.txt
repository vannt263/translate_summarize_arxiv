    "low ionization nuclear emission line regions , ( liners ) have been found to occur in nearly 1/3 of all bright , nearby galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "they share many of the emission characteristics of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , but are distinguished by their low luminosities and relatively strong , low - ionization emission lines ( e.g. , [ o  i ]  @xmath8@xmath86300 , 6363 , [ o  ii ]  @xmath83727 , [ n  ii ]  @xmath8@xmath86548,6584 , [ s  ii ] @xmath8@xmath86716,6731 ) .",
    "a recent study by ho ( 1999 ) has demonstrated that the uv @xmath7 x - ray spectral energy distribution of liners is harder than in higher luminosity agns .",
    "this is consistent with the general trend exhibited in agns of decreasing @xmath9 with decreasing luminosity ( @xcite ) .",
    "the physical relation between liners and agns is unclear .",
    "they may be simply the low luminosity extension of the agn phenomenon , powered by accretion onto a compact object or , alternatively , they may be the result of entirely different mechanisms .",
    "although central source photoionization appears to be the dominant mechanism powering the nebular emission seen in the high luminosity seyfert galaxies , it has not been thoroughly tested for galaxies containing liners .",
    "competing ionization mechanisms that have been used to successfully explain at least some of the emission characteristics of liners include photoionization by hot stars ( @xcite ) , photoionization by non - thermal emission typical of luminous agn ( @xcite ) and shock - heating ( @xcite ) .",
    "liners might represent a heterogeneous class of objects since the proposed ionization mechanisms can all explain the low apparent luminosity of liners .",
    "perhaps more than one of these various mechanisms is at work in the same object .",
    "ngc  1052 is a nearby ( z=0.0045 ; @xcite ) elliptical galaxy ( e4 ) with a strong nuclear emission line spectrum dominated by low ionization features .",
    "for example , the [ o  i ]  @xmath86300 and [ o  ii ]  @xmath83727 fluxes exceed that of [ o  iii ]  @xmath85007 , plus [ n  ii ]  @xmath86584/ h@xmath101 ( @xcite ) .",
    "fosbury et  al .",
    "1978 , hereafter f78 , showed that the emission line gas is comprised of a luminous central component ( d  @xmath11  2@xmath12 ) and a diffuse extended region ( d@xmath320@xmath12 ) .",
    "each emission region contributes approximately equally in total balmer line flux .",
    "furthermore , the extended component emits many of the other prominent optical lines that are observed in the spectrum of the central region , such as [ o  ii ]  @xmath83727 and [ o  iii ]  @xmath85007 ( f78 ) .",
    "the observed optical continuum emission is dominated by the host galaxy , with no clear detection of any underlying non - thermal emission ( f78 ; @xcite ) .",
    "radio studies , on the other hand , clearly show it to have both compact and extended continuum emission components . at @xmath31.5 ghz",
    ", its radio emission is characterized by a flat , unresolved ( @xmath11  1@xmath12 ) core and two weaker lobes extending 10 - 15@xmath12 on either side of the compact source ( @xcite ) .",

    "rosat_/hri imagery shows some extended soft x - ray emission , but the low spatial resolution at these energies prevents isolating any compact emission at scales less than 10@xmath12 ( @xcite ) .",
    "x - ray observations with _ asca _ indicate a very flat spectrum for the hard x - ray emission ( 2 - 10  kev ) of ngc  1052 ( @xcite ) .    as with liners in general",
    ", there is much disagreement on the nature of the excitation mechanism responsible for the nuclear activity in ngc  1052 .",
    "initial findings have suggested that shock - heating could produce the observed line emission ( @xcite ; f78 ) .",
    "this claim is largely based upon the high electron temperature ( t@xmath333,000 k ) implied by the strong [ o  iii ]  @xmath84363 emission .",
    "furthermore , simple shock excitation models have been shown to match the prominent optical emission features ( @xcite ; f78 ) . in an alternate interpretation ,",
    "ferland  & netzer  ( 1983 ) , and more recently ho et  al .",
    "( 1993 ) , have shown that many of the strong emission lines observed in ngc  1052 ( and in liners in general ) could be produced by photoionization from a nonthermal continuum typical of seyfert galaxies , namely a power law with spectral index , @xmath0@xmath14 - 1.5 .",
    "the major difference in the models between the typically more luminous seyferts and the liners is that the ionizing flux is inferred to be significantly weaker in liners .",
    "subsequent detailed photoionization modeling of ngc  1052 by pquinot ( 1984 ) , hereafter p84 , has shown that many of the optical emission lines , including [ o  iii ]  @xmath84363 , could be fit well by photoionization of a multi - density component gas .",
    "his study assumed a central photoionizing source consisting of a black body continuum with an x - ray tail extending to higher energies .",

    "this provides compelling evidence for the presence of a compact object and lends strong support to the non - stellar photoionization hypothesis .    in this paper",
    ", we present a detailed analysis of the nuclear activity in the prototypical liner galaxy ngc  1052 .",
    "specifically , we use _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ observations of ngc  1052 to explore if photoionization represents a viable option in explaining the emission line spectrum in this liner . in section  2",
    "we describe the hst imagery and spectroscopic observations used in this study and present our measured emission line fluxes and an analysis of the wfpc2 h@xmath0 imagery .",
    "we examine the possible role of extinction on the emission line fluxes and ionizing continuum .",
    "the methodology and results of our photoionization modeling are given in section  3 . in section  4",
    ", we discuss the implications of our results and compare them with previous studies to form a comprehensive picture of the activity of ngc  1052 .",
    "finally , we summarize our results and present our conclusions in section  5 .",
    "the spectral data used in this study were obtained with the faint object spectrograph aboard the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst_/ fos ) on 1997  january  13 .",
    "they were retrieved from the space telescope science institute ( stsci ) data archives .",
    "all observations were of the active nucleus of ngc  1052 through the 0@xmath12.86-pair square aperture ( post - costar ) , covering 1200 - 6800  @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the aperture sampled the central 82  pc  @xmath2  82  pc of the nuclear region of ngc  1052 , assuming d  =  19.6  mpc for h@xmath16  =  75  km  s@xmath15  mpc@xmath15 .",
    "the optical and near - uv data were obtained with high resolution gratings giving @xmath8/@xmath17@xmath31300 , while the uv spectrum has a lower resolution given by @xmath8/@xmath17@xmath3250 .",
    "the individual spectra are described in table  1 along with their exposure times , grating settings , and spectral resolutions .",
    "because of a guide - star lock failure , the data may have slightly degraded spectral resolution and sample a slightly larger spatial region than the aperture size would indicate .",
    "if the extended regions emit differently than the nucleus , this may have an effect on the observed emission line ratios and absolute fluxes .    using the maps of burstein & heiles ( 1982 )",
    ", we find a foreground galactic reddening value of e(b - v )  =  0.02 in the direction of ngc  1052 .",
    "figure  1 shows the spectrum in the rest frame of ngc  1052 , corrected for galactic extinction using the extinction law of savage  & mathis ( 1979 ) .",
    "examination of the uv spectrum below 2000  @xmath1 in figure  1 shows a weak uv continuum compared to the optical continuum , although , there appears to be a slight rise toward lower wavelengths .",
    "this uv continuum shows no evidence for recent starburst activity in the nucleus of ngc  1052 . specifically , the common signatures of hot o  and  b stars , namely broad wind features from c  iv  @xmath81549 , si  iv  @xmath81400 , and n  v  @xmath81240 and narrower photospheric lines ( neubig  & bruhweiler  1997 , 1999 ) , are absent within the low detection limits of the data .",
    "although the results are not definitive , the absence of stellar features is consistent with the uv continuum being produced by a non - thermal compact source .",
    "numerous uv emission lines are detected in the fos spectrum , compared to the iue study in which only two lines , c  iii ]  @xmath81909 and c  ii ]  @xmath82326 , were unambiguously measured ( @xcite ) .",
    "visual inspection of the optical and near - uv data at @xmath8  @xmath18  2000  @xmath1 in figure  1 clearly shows that the host elliptical galaxy dominates the continuum .",
    "strong stellar absorption features are evident and may affect flux measurements of certain emission lines , especially the balmer lines .",
    "in addition , small wavelength variations in the composite stellar spectrum of the host galaxy may mimic emission line features . to remove the spectral contribution of the host galaxy",
    ", we have used template spectra of elliptical galaxies from the _ hst_/fos archival database to approximate its integrated stellar spectrum .",
    "we selected a proper template spectrum for each of the three optical gratings ( g270h , g400h , and g570h ) based upon the following criteria : + 1 ) we required the prominent absorption features that do not coincide with emission features in ngc  1052 to match those in the host spectrum of ngc  1052 ( namely , mg  i  @xmath82852 , ca  ii  k  @xmath83934 , g  band  @xmath84301 , fe  i  @xmath84440 , fe  i  @xmath84532 , mg  ib  @xmath85176 , fe  i  @xmath85333 , ca  i/ mg  h  @xmath85590 , na  i doublet  @xmath85893 , and ca  i/ fe  i @xmath86161 ; @xcite ) ; + 2 ) we required the overall galactic flux distribution to be similar to that in ngc  1052 . + the template spectra were then scaled in magnitude , so that the strengths of the absorption features matched that of ngc  1052 , and subtracted from it .",
    "our template spectra are listed in table  1 and plotted with the corresponding spectra of ngc  1052 in figure  1 .",
    "since there is very little stellar contribution to the uv in elliptical galaxies and no evidence for hot stars in ngc  1052 , no template was used for the g160l grating .",
    "we then measured the emission line fluxes using the subtracted spectrum corrected for galactic extinction .",
    "flux ratios relative to h@xmath4 are given in table  2 . to measure the line fluxes",
    ", uncontaminated continuum regions were selected on either side of the features to be measured .",
    "a linear fit was made to the continuum underlying the emission features and the lines were extracted .",
    "in several cases , it was difficult to distinguish between real emission lines and artifacts remaining from our attempt to remove the underlying spectum of the host galaxy .",
    "this is most notable in the he  ii  @xmath84686 emission . in table  2 , we have indicated where these uncertainties are large .",
    "the emission line widths are broader than typically observed in the narrow line regions of agn , corresponding to a range of velocities between 900  km  s@xmath15  @xmath11  fwhm  @xmath11  1100  km  s@xmath15 ( by comparison , the instrumental resolution for the high dispersion gratings is fwhm@xmath3230  km  s@xmath15 ) .    in several cases , it was necessary to deblend line contributors before accurate emission line fluxes could be derived . in all cases",
    ", the spectra were converted to velocity space to preserve the correct line widths .",
    "for example , h@xmath0 is heavily blended with the [ n  ii ] @xmath196548,6584 doublet . to extract the h@xmath0 feature , the normalized line profile of h@xmath4",
    "was used to make a template for both of the [ n  ii ] lines , since no broad wings were detected on the h@xmath4 profile .",
    "this technique proved more accurate than fitting with gaussian profiles because it approximates the actual structure of the emission lines .",
    "the [ n  ii ] template was created by separating the two profiles according to their intrinsic transition wavelengths and assuming the flux ratio corresponds to that of their einstein a - values ( a@xmath20/a@xmath21=2.96 ) .",
    "the wavelength offset and relative flux of the template were then varied until the residual of the [ n  ii ] contribution subtracted from the h@xmath0+[n  ii ] line blend gave the best fit to h@xmath0 , namely , a single emission feature on a flat continuum ( figure 2a ) .",
    "figure 2b shows the resulting h@xmath0 fit compared to the h@xmath4 velocity profile and demonstrates the reliability of this technique .",
    "several other line blends were treated using the same technique .",
    "it is important to deblend and provide accurate flux ratios for the [ s  ii ]  @xmath196716,6731 lines because they provide a low density constraint for the emission line region .",
    "to fit them , h@xmath4 profiles were centered at the intrinsic wavelengths of the two [ s  ii ] lines .",
    "the flux ratio was varied until residuals were minimized .",
    "for line blends of other hydrogen lines , namely h@xmath22+[o",
    "iii ]  @xmath84363 and h@xmath23+[ne  iii ]  @xmath83967 , the h@xmath4 profile was used as a template for the balmer line since it will have an identical intrinsic shape .",
    "all lines which required deblending are noted in table 2 .      the primary sources of uncertainty are continuum placement in extracting emission lines and the approximations associated with the deblending procedure .",
    "for the first case , the uncertainty depends on the strength of the emission line relative to the noise of the data and the existence of host galaxy features .",
    "we experimented with continuum levels for lines of different strengths .",
    "for the optical and near - uv data , where the host galaxy is dominant but spectral resolution is high , this leads to an estimate of the uncertainty for @xmath24strong  lines of @xmath255@xmath26 ( defined as having f  @xmath27  f@xmath6 ) , for @xmath24moderate strength  lines @xmath2510@xmath26 ( 0.2@xmath2f@xmath6  @xmath28  f  @xmath28",
    "f@xmath6 ) , and for @xmath24weak  lines @xmath2520@xmath26 ( f  @xmath11  0.2@xmath2f@xmath6 ) . for wavelengths below @xmath32000  @xmath1",
    ", there is much less contribution from the host galaxy , however , the signal - to - noise ratio is significantly deteriorated .",
    "consequently , we find flux uncertainties of the moderate strength lines to be @xmath2520@xmath26 and the weak lines to be @xmath2530@xmath26 , for wavelengths below 2000  @xmath1 .",
    "additional uncertainties are introduced for lines that require deblending .",
    "to reliably estimate this uncertainty , the flux of the residual associated with the [ n  ii ]  @xmath86584 line ( see figure  2a ) was measured and shown to be @xmath2510@xmath26 of the measured flux for the line .",
    "this represents an upper limit to the general deblending uncertainty because it was the largest relative residual of all procedures .",
    "these two uncertainties were then added in quadrature to obtain the total error for the measured line ratios . the total uncertainty estimate for each emission line",
    "is listed in table  2 .      to estimate the internal reddening of ngc 1052",
    ", we compared our measured h@xmath0/h@xmath4 flux ratio ( f@xmath5/f@xmath6  =  4.53 , corrected for galactic extinction ) to an assumed intrinsic ratio ( h@xmath0/h@xmath4)@xmath29 . for n@xmath30",

    "this implies a reddening of e(b - v )  =  0.42  @xmath25.20 , where the uncertainty was derived from the errors associated with the h@xmath0 and h@xmath4 flux measurements .",
    "the deduced intrinsic line ratios are listed in table  2 .",
    "uncertainties were estimated from propagation of errors associated with the reddening and observed flux ratios . since all previous studies of ngc  1052 determined negligible internal reddening ,",
    "it is important to examine this issue in more detail ( koski  & osterbrock 1976 ; f78 ; fosbury et  al .  1981 ; ho et  al .  1993 ; ho et  al .  1997 ) .",
    "the intrinsic he  ii  @xmath81640/he  ii  @xmath84686 ratio is theoretically a better measure of reddening than h@xmath0/h@xmath4 because of the large span in wavelength between the two lines ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the large flux uncertainties associated with the he  ii lines greatly diminish the usefulness of this diagnostic for our data set .",
    "yet , we can still use it as a check on our reddening deduced from the balmer line ratio .",
    "we assume an intrinsic ratio of ( he  ii  @xmath81640/he  ii  @xmath84686)@xmath29  =  6.6 , corresponding to n@xmath30  =  10@xmath31  @xmath32 and t@xmath30  =  10,000  k ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is consistent with the dereddened ratio of he  ii  @xmath81640/he  ii  @xmath84686  @xmath27 4.2 considering the large uncertainties associated with these line fluxes ( table  2 ) .",
    "we can also use the relative flux ratios of the higher order hydrogen balmer lines beyond h@xmath4 as a consistency check .",
    "a comparison of the dereddened balmer ratios with their intrinsic values is given in table  3 ( @xcite ) .",
    "they are seen to be consistent within the quoted uncertainties .",
    "the colors of the host galaxy of ngc  1052 , b - v  =  0.91 , u - b  =  0.42 , are in accord with typical colors found in normal elliptical galaxies of similar hubble type , e4 ( f78 ) .",
    "thus , the large extinction found above is not consistent if applied to the entire galaxy . if the implied reddening is correct , it suggests that dust is localized to the nuclear region of ngc  1052 .",
    "there is evidence which supports this .",
    "the b - r and b - i images of carter et  al .",

    "( 1982 ) indicate a large ir excess between 5 - 20  @xmath13 m confined within 2@xmath12 of the nucleus .",
    "the strength of the ir flux at these wavelengths is not consistent with stellar radiation emanating from cool stars and may be thermal radiation from heated dust .",
    "images of the nuclear region of ngc  1052 were taken with wfpc2/_hst _ using the f658n filter on 1996  june  16 .",
    "these data were obtained from the stsci data archives .",
    "this filter isolates any extended h@xmath0 emission . in figure  4 , we have combined two exposures ( with 800 and 900  s exposure times ) and removed cosmic ray events .",
    "the size of the aperture used for the fos observations is shown over the bright emission core for reference , although the precise position of the aperture is uncertain due to the guide star lock failure .",
    "strong filamentary nebular h@xmath0 emission is seen to extend about 1@xmath12 around the compact nucleus , with a more diffuse halo extending to further distances . at a position angle of @xmath3235@xmath33",

    "the purpose of the following analysis is to determine if the emission in the compact nuclear region of ngc  1052 is consistent with photoionization by a simple non - thermal continuum , characteristic of agns .",
    "we seek the simplest model , making the fewest number of assumptions , that gives a satisfactory fit to the dereddened intrinsic emission line spectrum .",
    "discrepancies between our model results and the observed spectrum then provide further insight into the actual physical conditions in ngc  1052 .    photoionization models were computed using version  90 of the computer code cloudy ( @xcite ) .",
    "these models were parameterized by the gas density n@xmath34 , continuum shape , and ionization parameter    @xmath35    where q is the number of hydrogen ionizing photons s@xmath15 and r the distance from the inner face of the cloud to the central continuum source .",
    "when a good fit was achieved , observational constraints on the ionizing luminosity provided constraints on r.    we adopted the following idealized properties of the emission line gas . in cases where more than one density component was required , we assumed that each component was photoionized by unattenuated radiation from the central source .",
    "thus we assume , _ a  priori _ , relatively small covering factors for any inner gas components .",
    "physically , this corresponds to a clumpy gas composed of radiation bounded clouds .",

    "this indicates that the soft x - ray emission is likely heavily absorbed , which is consistent with the modeling by weaver et  al .",

    "simple model calculations using a gas with constant density do not match the intrinsic emission line spectrum of ngc  1052 for any choice of density .",
    "one important problem with these models is that they can not match both the auroral and nebular line fluxes simultaneously . when a low density gas is used , n@xmath34@xmath310@xmath45  @xmath32 , the nebular lines are fit well ( i.e. , [ o  iii ]  @xmath8@xmath85007,4959 , [ n  ii ] @xmath8@xmath86548,6584 , [ o  ii ]  @xmath83727 , and [ s  ii ] @xmath8@xmath86716,6731 ) , but their auroral line counterparts are under estimated , namely [ o  iii ] @xmath84363 , [ o  ii ] @xmath82470 , and [ s  ii ] @xmath8@xmath84069,4076 . for higher densities ,",
    "the opposite is true .",
    "as noted earlier , it was the high temperature implied by the [ o  iii ]  @xmath84363/[o  iii ] @xmath8@xmath84959,5007 ratio that led to the original interpretation of shock excitation for ngc  1052 . indeed , our [ o  iii ] line flux ratio , [ o  iii ]  @xmath84363/ [ o  iii ] @xmath194959,5007@xmath3 0.089 , implies t@xmath18100,000  k in the low density limit ( @xcite ) , which is a factor @xmath35 higher than we would expect in the o@xmath46 zone of a photoionized nebulae .",
    "however , choosing the high density that matches this ratio under - estimates the other nebular line fluxes because their critical densites are much lower than that of [ o  iii ]  @xmath8@xmath85007,4959 , which have critical density , n@xmath47  =  6.5@xmath210@xmath48  @xmath32 .",
    "the detailed analysis of p84 showed this could be remedied by employing two separate gas components having different densities . in this scenario ,",
    "the nebular lines overwhelm their auroral counterparts in a low density region where their ratios are determined solely by temperature .",
    "conversely , in a higher density gas the nebular line emissions are suppressed due to collisional de - excitation and , consequently , the auroral line fluxes become a more significant source of cooling . hence",

    "multi - component gases having a range of densities are a common feature in models for liners and seyfert galaxies ( halpern & steiner 1984 ; filippenko 1985 ; kraemer et  al .",
    "1994 , 1998 ) . since we seek the simplest possible model , our method was to find the fewest number of discrete cloud components that would reproduce the observed emission .",
    "although assuming a small number of distinct isolated gas components might be an oversimplification , it provides insight into the physical conditions and structure of the emission line gas .",
    "an alternate approach , the locally optimally emitting cloud model , has also been shown to effectively model the narrow line region emission in agns ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , as a first modification to the simple model , we assumed a gas comprised of two density components .",
    "our method was to fit the nebular lines that have very low critical densities ( [ s  ii ] @xmath8@xmath86716,6731 , [ n  ii ] @xmath8@xmath86548,6584 , and [ o  ii ] @xmath83727 ) with a low density gas , component  1 , and the strongest auroral lines ( ie , those of s@xmath49 , o@xmath49 , and o@xmath50 ) with a higher density gas , component  2 .",
    "critical densities of various lines place constraints on the density for each component .",
    "if the [ o  ii ]  @xmath83727 line is a principal coolant for component  1 , the gas density must not be significantly greater than its critical density of n@xmath47  =  4500  @xmath32 ( @xcite )",

    "since the spectrum of ngc  1052 is dominated by lines of low ionization species , lines emitted by s@xmath49 , n@xmath49 , o@xmath53 , o@xmath49 , and c@xmath49 , a low ionization parameter is required .",

    "was created by assuming equal contribution from each component to the total observed h@xmath4 flux .",
    "inspection of table  4 shows that the overall intrinsic emission line spectrum of ngc  1052 is fit very well by our photoionization model , which has employed a minimum of assumptions .",
    "particulary , the strong auroral line fluxes of [ o  iii ]  @xmath84363 , [ o  ii ]  @xmath82470 , and [ s  ii ] @xmath194069,4076 are matched well , as are the [ o  iii ]  @xmath84363/[o  iii ]  @xmath85007 and [ o  ii ]  @xmath82470/ [ o  ii ]  @xmath83727 ratios , which are often mistakenly used as temperature indicators .",
    "however , several of the prominent low ionization features are considerably underpredicted .",
    "for example , the observed [ n  ii ]  @xmath196548,6584 , [ s  ii ]  @xmath196716,6731 , and [ o  i ]  @xmath196300,6363 line fluxes are matched within a factor of two , but are all somewhat underestimated .",
    "the c  ii ]  @xmath82326 fit is even worse .",
    "all of these poorly fit lines emit predominately in the warm partially ionized zones , [ s  ii ] @xmath196716 , 6731 and [ n  ii ]  @xmath196548,6584 most strongly in component  1 and [ o  i ] @xmath196300 , 6363 and c  ii ]  @xmath82326 primarily in the high density component  2 . the characteristic emission in these regions is likely greatly modified by the presence of dust due to the heavy depletion of important coolants ( particularly magnesium and silicon ) and an increase in gas temperature caused by the selective removal of photons near the lyman limit by dust grains . to treat this ,",
    "we have included grains typical of the orion nebula mixed with the emission line gas ( @xcite ) .",
    "we selected this type of grain structure since , of the available data for dust grains , physical conditions in an h  ii region most closely approximate those of ngc  1052 .",
    "constraints on the dust - to - gas ratio in ngc  1052 come from the strengths of the si  iii ]  @xmath8@xmath81882,1892 and mg  ii  @xmath82800 fluxes .",
    "the calculated emission of these lines becomes too weak when the full depletion deduced for orion is used in our models ( @xcite : based on results of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we assumed half of the depletion and grain abundances , giving the following elemental abundances relative to hydrogen : he  =  9.77@xmath210@xmath60 , c  =  3.31@xmath210@xmath36 , n  =  8.13@xmath210@xmath37 , o  =  5.50@xmath210@xmath36 , ne  =  8.51@xmath210@xmath37 , mg  =  1.07@xmath210@xmath37 , si  =  1.20@xmath210@xmath37 , s  =  1.29@xmath210@xmath37 , and fe  =  1.02@xmath210@xmath37 .    model results , using the same parameters as in our previous model are given in table  5 . we have included model predictions of the [ ca  ii ] @xmath197291 , 7324 lines for both the dusty and solar abundance models in tables  5 and  4 , respectively .",
    "ferland ( 1993 ) has shown that the weakness of these lines in the narrow line regions of some agns is a good indicator of the presence of grains - a sharp decrease in their strengths is expected with depletion . indeed ,",
    "comparison of the results of our two models demonstrates this . specifically , the dusty model predicts a decrease in the strength of the lines by a factor of ten . although the [ ca  ii ] lines lie outside of the spectral region covered by our data , the near infrared spectral data of diaz et  al .",
    "( 1985 ) clearly show that their strengths are overpredicted by our dust free model ( see their figure  1 ) .",
    "thus , there is evidence that significant depletion exists in ngc  1052 .",
    "our depletion percentage corresponds to a gas column - to - reddening scaling of roughly n@xmath34/e(b - v )  =  1@xmath210@xmath61  @xmath40  mag@xmath15 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the ionized column densities of our gas components are comparatively small ( n@xmath62  = 3.1@xmath210@xmath63 @xmath40 and n@xmath62  =  3.6@xmath210@xmath64  @xmath40 , for components  1 and  2 , respectively ) .",
    "thus , most of the reddening occurs in a neutral gas obscuring our line of sight to the emitting regions .",
    "if this obscuration is due to gas component  1 of our model , n@xmath34  = 10@xmath45 @xmath32 , a cloud thickness of only @xmath65  pc is required to produce the observed extinction .",
    "the polarimetry study by barth et  al.(1999 ) shows that [ o  i ]  @xmath86300 is more polarized than the other @xmath24narrow  emission lines between @xmath34800@xmath7 6800 @xmath1 , with a polarization percentage more than twice as much as any other line .",
    "this indicates that [ o  i ]  @xmath86300 may be transmitted through more dust than the other lines .",
    "this effect is explained naturally , as in our model , if [ o  i ]  @xmath86300 is emitted predominately in an extended dusty partially ionized zone ( piz ) .",
    "if we are viewing the line emission primarily from the ionized faces of the gas clouds , then the lines emitted in the @xmath24back side  of the gas pass through a much larger dust column before escaping .",
    "our calculations show that the piz of component  2 , where [ o  i ]  @xmath86300 is most strongly produced , has a much larger column density than the piz of component  1 . since this is the region where the [ n  ii ]  @xmath8@xmath86548,6584 and [ s  ii ]  @xmath8@xmath86716,6731 lines are emitted , this explains why there is much less polarization of these lines than of the [ o  i ]  @xmath86300 line .",
    "we now turn our attention toward the structure of the emission line region as deduced from our model results .",
    "since we have an estimate of the luminosity of ionizing radiation , we can calculate the radial distances of the different gas components from the putative central engine , r@xmath55 and r@xmath58 , using u  @xmath66  l@xmath67/r@xmath68 .",
    "this gives r@xmath55  @xmath3  100  pc and r@xmath58  @xmath3  2  pc .",
    "the deduced location of component  1 lies outside the projected aperture by about a factor of 2 , however , the uncertainty in the intrinsic luminosity could account for this discrepancy . furthermore ,",
    "if the gas is spherically distributed , then much of it would be projected into the aperture .",
    "the broad widths of the emission lines ( 900  @xmath11 fwhm @xmath11 1100 km  s@xmath15 ) give clues to the gas dynamics in ngc  1052 .",
    "we find no correlation between line width and critical density .",
    "thus , since the high and low density components are at very different distances from the putative central massive object , the velocities of the two components can not be explained as simple circular keplerian orbits , for which v  @xmath66  r@xmath69 .    as mentioned earlier ,",
    "our assumption that the line emitting gas is comprised of distinct components having constant densities is a rough approximation , but qualitatively the higher density gas is seen to be closer to the center of the nucleus . to match the calculated h@xmath4 luminosity with the observed luminosity , covering factors of @xmath23@xmath55  =  0.28 and @xmath23@xmath58",
    "=  0.25 are required for components 1 and 2 , respectively , assuming that each component contributes equally to the total h@xmath4 emission .",
    "model predictions of l@xmath6 for each component are given in table  5 .",
    "since the covering factors for each component were calculated independently of each other , the attenuation of the inner component was not treated and hence @xmath23@xmath55 represents a minimum covering factor for the outer component .",
    "therefore , a minimum total covering factor for ngc  1052 is @xmath23@xmath70  =  0.53 , which represents the probability that the line - of - sight to the central continuum is obscured by the emission line gas .",
    "this is considerably higher than that determined for the narrow line regions of seyfert  1 galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , our previous assumption that the central ionizing continuum is occulted by a dusty gas is vindicated .",
    "this is consistent with the study by barth et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) which concluded that many liners may have bright compact uv sources that are obscured by dust .",
    "although the spectrum of ngc  1052 is dominated by low ionization features , there are several high ionization features present , namely , c  iv  @xmath81549 , [ ne  iv ]  @xmath82424 , and [ ne  v ]  @xmath83426 .",
    "as anticipated from our choice of low ionization parameters , u@xmath55  & u@xmath58 , these lines are greatly underestimated . in particular , the predicted c  iv  @xmath81549 is @xmath34 times too weak and [ ne  iv ]  @xmath82424 and [ ne  v ]  @xmath83426 are underpredicted by a factor of @xmath310 . imposing the required u on either of the two gas components",
    "would severely degrade our fit to the prominent low ionization features , giving results characteristic of seyfert galaxies .",
    "indeed , it is this lower ionization that distinguishes liners from other active galaxies .",
    "thus , there is an indication that a highly ionized gas component is present in ngc  1052 , although its contribution is small .    the critical density of [ ne  iv ]  @xmath82424 limits n@xmath30@xmath113@xmath210@xmath31  @xmath32 .",
    "however , for a gas with this low density and having a high ionization parameter , the [ o  iii ]  @xmath8@xmath85007,4959 lines become the dominant coolants and their fluxes are far overpredicted .",
    "we find that an emitting gas that is matter bounded can account for this . for illustrative purposes",
    ", we have calculated the emission for a gas without dust grains having u@xmath71  =  10@xmath72 and n@xmath34  =  10@xmath73  @xmath32 and a total column density of n@xmath34  =  10@xmath74  @xmath40 .",
    "this corresponds to a distance r@xmath71@xmath33  pc of the highly ionized gas from the central continuum source .",
    "a very low covering factor of only @xmath30.05 is required to match the observed c  iv  @xmath81549 luminosity with this extra component , hence our assumption that all components receive unattenuated continuum radiation remains valid .",
    "this simple model for a highly ionized component matches the observed [ ne  v ]  @xmath83426 emission line very well and the [ ne  iv ]  @xmath82424 line within a factor of 2 .",
    "furthermore , since the emissivity of c  iv  @xmath81549 is very high under these conditions , there would be only a small contribution from this component and , therefore , no change in the low ionization line ratios predicted by a three - component model from those listed in tables  4  &  5 .",
    "we have shown that a simple photoionization model explains the full set of dereddened optical and uv emission lines observed in the fos data of ngc  1052 quite well .",
    "we note that the reddening correction we have applied to the uv continuum is highly uncertain and that this enhanced luminosity is essential in reproducing the line luminosities .",
    "our best fit model employs a dusty emission line gas with a high covering factor .",
    "this is consistent with the apparent absorption of the soft x - ray flux observed in the _ rosat _ data , indicating that the line - of - sight toward the agn is obscured .",
    "the flat intrinsic ionizing continuum ( @xmath0  =  @xmath71.2 ) that we have deduced for ngc  1052 is in accord with the recent study by ho ( 1999 ) which demonstrated that a sample of liners all have a higher x - ray / uv continuum ratio than found in typical high luminosity agns .",
    "we examine if the deduced ionizing continuum flux is sufficient to power the extended emission line region ( eelr ) emission described in f78 .",
    "they found a diffuse emission line gas extending out to about 20@xmath12 from the nucleus having a total balmer line flux similar to that observed in the nuclear emission region . using their flux measurements and assuming that all of the emission line fluxes experience the extinction that we have deduced from our analysis gives l@xmath6@xmath32.6@xmath210@xmath75 ergs  s@xmath15 for the total h@xmath4 luminosity in the extended plus compact emission components .",
    "a simple photon - counting argument ( @xcite ) using our deduced continuum shape and lyman edge flux demonstrates that a covering factor of @xmath32 is required to produce the h@xmath4 luminosity .",
    "a covering factor greater than unity indicates that if all of the line emission in ngc  1052 ( extended  +  compact ) is powered by photoionization from the putative non - thermal continuum , then our view of this continuum must be even more obscured than we have previously deduced .",
    "furthermore , the large covering factor of the inner gas regions calculated in our model suggests that the shape of the ionizing continuum incident upon the extended region would be greatly modified .",
    "however , the attenuation of uv continuum photons by the emission line gas in the compact region would result in a much harder sed incident upon the extended gas and a much higher actual covering factor for the eelr is required .",
    "an alternate explanation is that the central source emission is beamed in ngc  1052 such that the continuum flux `` seen '' by the emitting gas in the extended regions is enhanced .",
    "another possibility , is that some process other than photoionization by the central source drives the emission in the eelr , either stellar photoionization or shock excitation . a detailed analysis of the diffuse emission regions is needed to fully test this .",
    "as noted in section 3 , one discrepancy in our model is the underestimate of the c  ii ]  @xmath82326 flux by a factor of @xmath32 .",
    "the c  ii ]  @xmath82326 emission is strong in a gas with low ionization parameter and high density .",
    "however , calculations show that the mg  ii @xmath82800 flux is far overpredicted using these model conditions . alternately , c  ii ]  @xmath82326 is produced predominantly in the piz of a photoionized gas , suggesting",
    "a stronger x - ray continuum would strengthen the feature .",
    "the [ o  i ]  @xmath8@xmath86300,6363 line fluxes are more sensitive to the high energy flux and are greatly over - estimated if the x - ray continuum is enhanced .",
    "a poor choice of the extinction curve may account for this discrepancy .",
    "several studies have shown that the uv dust extinction in extragalactic objects is not represented well by the galactic savage  & mathis curve ( @xcite )",
    ". often a weaker 2200  @xmath1 absorption feature and steeper rise in the far - uv are found . as an _",
    "ad  hoc _ demonstration , we show how the uv line strengths are affected by removing the 2200  @xmath1 bump from the extinction curve in table  6 .",
    "the [ c  ii ]  @xmath82326 and [ ne  iv ]  @xmath82424 line fluxes are both significantly reduced , illustrating that if an extinction law incorporating a strong 2200  @xmath1 feature were erroneously applied , it could lead to a substantial overestimate of the intrinsic strengths of these lines .",
    "we have analyzed archival _ hst_/fos data of the prototypical liner galaxy ngc  1052 .",
    "the aperture sampled the inner @xmath3  82  pc@xmath282  pc of the nuclear region , thereby excluding the extended emission region .",
    "one important result is that the deduced h@xmath0/h@xmath4 ratio provides evidence for considerable extinction ( e(b - v ) = 0.42 ) of the emission line fluxes in ngc  1052 .",
    "dust appears to be concentrated in or near the nucleus and may also be attenuating the nonthermal continuum of a compact source , which supports the barth et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) conclusion that the nuclei of many liners are obscured by dust .    from our modeling results ,",
    "we find that the nuclear emission observed in the inner region of ngc  1052 is explained well by photoionization from a simple power law continuum having a flat spectral index , @xmath0=@xmath71.2 .",
    "moreover , the ionizing continuum is consistent with our deduced reddening and observed flux distribution .",
    "this is also consistent with the study by ho ( 1999 ) which showed that a sample of liners all have a flat spectral energy distribution in the ionizing continuum .",
    "most of the dereddened line fluxes are matched by a model having two dusty gas components of different densities , photoionized by a single power law continuum .",
    "the appearance of the c  iv  @xmath81549 , [ ne  iv ]  @xmath82424 , and [ ne  v ]  @xmath83426 lines in the spectrum indicates a third gas component may be present , characterized by a high ionization parameter . the key exception to our good model fit is the prominent c  ii ]  @xmath82326 line , which is underpredicted by a factor of about two .",
    "this flux is heavily affected by the strength of the 2200  @xmath1 absorption feature .",
    "hence , the c  ii ]  @xmath82326 line would be overestimated if the 2200  @xmath1 bump of the savage & mathis extinction curve is not applicable to ngc  1052 .",
    "this would also help explain the underestimate of the [ ne  iv ]  @xmath82424 flux .",
    "we conclude that a pure central source photoionization model with the simplest non - thermal continuum ( a simple power law ) reproduce the emission line fluxes in the inner region of ngc  1052 quite well .",
    "other processes such as shocks or photoionization by stars are not required to produce the observed emission .",
