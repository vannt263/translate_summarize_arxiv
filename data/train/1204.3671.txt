    "there are many coordinate systems related to @xmath11 via conservative transformations , however we , as observers , have a natural preference for the manifold view [ 6 ] . thus among all possible coordinates the holonomic coordinates are preferred .",
    "the geometrical content is determined by the vector @xmath19 , where the ricci rotation coefficient is given by @xmath20 [ 1 - 3 ] .",
    "pandres calls this the curvature vector and shows that @xmath21 is invariant under transformations from @xmath11 to @xmath22 if and only if the transformation is conservative and thus satisfies ( 1 ) .",

    "green has extended the field variables [ 4 ] to include the tetrad @xmath25 and 4 internal vectors @xmath26 and an additional internal space @xmath27 .",

    "( note : our sign conventions are the same as misner , thorne and wheeler [ 7 ] . ) thus , when the physical space is interpreted as a manifold , the lagrangian density of the free field contains terms corresponding to non - gravitational interactions [ 3,5 ] .    setting the variations of @xmath30 with respect to @xmath31 equal to zero yields the field equations @xmath32",
    "an identity for the einstein tensor is ( using misner , thorne and wheeler sign conventions [ 7 ] ) @xmath33 this expression is not manifestly symmetric in @xmath34 and @xmath35 , but the left - hand side is symmetric in its lower indices and hence the right - hand side must be as well .",

    "let @xmath57 represent the radial pressure of the free field .",
    "then we find [ 7 ] that the radial pressure of the free field is given by @xmath58 and from ( 12 ) we find that @xmath59    let the tangential pressure [ 7 ] of the free field be denoted by @xmath60 .",

    "let us investigate the situation further . in standard general relativity , in regions @xmath92 free of sources and fields , we have the curvature tensor is identically zero and hence at the extremum , @xmath93 if we introduce a cosmological constant , @xmath0 , into the standard theory the free - field lagrangian [ 7,10 ] is @xmath94 resulting in field equations @xmath95 .",

    "no such dilemma occurs with the theory based on the conservation group . from ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) with the @xmath104 term dropped ( since a pure divergence contributes nothing to the field equations )",

    "note the negative tangential pressure .",
    "one particularly simple model is given by @xmath124 with this choice , @xmath125 .",
