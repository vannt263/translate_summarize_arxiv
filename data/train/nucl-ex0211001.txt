    "the measurement of resonances that have lifetimes smaller than , or comparable to , the lifetime of the dense matter produced in relativistic heavy - ion collisions provides an important tool for studying the collision dynamics .",

    "in addition , the measurement of @xmath0 production can provide information for studying the di - lepton decay channel , since the @xmath4 production in the hadronic ` cocktail ' is currently based on model calculations @xcite .",

    "the main star detector consists of a large time projection chamber ( tpc ) @xcite placed inside an uniform solenoidal magnetic field of 0.5 t. the tpc provides the measurement of charged particles .",
    "about 2 m au - au minimum bias events and about 4.7 m pp events at @xmath3 = 200 gev are used in this analysis .",

    "both @xmath17 and f@xmath18 production measured at rhic seem to follow the trend of previous measurements .",
    "figure [ ratios ] also shows the k@xmath11/k and @xmath26/k@xmath11 ratios measured in different colliding systems at various energies .",
    "the k@xmath11/k ratio is interesting because k@xmath11 and k have similar quark content and differ mainly in mass and spin . from fig .",
    "[ ratios ] , the k@xmath11/k ratio from @xmath3= 200 gev au - au collisions is lower than the pp measurement at the same energy by a factor of 2 .",
    "the @xmath26/k@xmath11 ratio measures the strangeness suppression in nearly ideal conditions since @xmath32s = 1 , since strangeness is hidden in the @xmath26 , and there is only a small mass difference .",
    "[ ratios ] shows an increase of the ratio @xmath26/k@xmath11 measured in au - au collisions compared to the measurements in pp and e@xmath29e@xmath30 at lower energies .",
    "however , this increase may not be solely related to strangeness suppression due to additional effects on short lived resonances in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the k@xmath11 lifetime is short ( c@xmath33 = 4 fm ) and comparable to the time scale of the evolution of the system in relativistic heavy - ion collisions . if the k@xmath11 decay between chemical and kinetic freeze - out , the daughters from the decay may re - scatter and the k@xmath11 will not be reconstructed . on the other hand ,",
    "elastic interactions are still effective after chemical freeze - out @xcite and may regenerate the k@xmath11 until kinetic freeze - out .",
    "assuming that the difference in the k@xmath11/k ratio measured in @xmath3= 200 gev au - au and pp collisions is due to the k@xmath11 survival probability , our measurement is consistent with a time of only a few fm between chemical and kinetic freeze - out ( scenario @xcite ) .",
    "hence , our measurement at rhic is consistent with either a sudden freeze - out with no k@xmath11 regeneration or a long time scenario ( @xmath3420 fm @xcite ) with significant k@xmath11 regeneration .",
    "preliminary results on @xmath5 , k@xmath35 and f@xmath18(980 ) production measured at mid - rapidity by the star detector in @xmath3= 200 gev hadronic au - au and pp interactions at rhic were presented .",
    "the data show significant production of these short - lived resonances . the k@xmath11 production at rhic rules out a long expansion time between chemical and kinetic freeze - out unless there is significant k@xmath11 regeneration , due to elastic interactions after chemical freeze - out .",
    "finally , the study of short - lived resonances may provide important information on the collision dynamics .",
