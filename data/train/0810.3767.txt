    "the energetic gamma - ray experiment telescope ( egret ) aboard the _ compton gamma - ray observatory _ detected the gamma - ray emissions from six pulsars ( thompson 2004 ) , five of which show pulsed radio emissions .",
    "the sixth , geminga pulsar , has known as a radio quiet @xmath0-ray pulsar or with very weak radio emissions ( vats et al .",
    "1999 ) . because of the observed high brightness temperature of radio emissions from pulsars , the radio radiation is a coherent mechanism . on the other hand , the emission mechanisms in optical through @xmath0-ray bands are non - coherent and non - thermal processes , which have been discussed with the polar cap model , the slot gap model and the outer gap model in the literature .",
    "the polar cap accelerator has been considered as the origin of radio emission from pulsars ( ruderman & sutherland 1975 ) .",
    "the configuration of the dipole magnetic field in inner magnetosphere region provides a natural explanation of position - angle curve of polarization of the radio pulse . for @xmath0-ray emissions",
    ", however , the polar cap model has to invoke both a small inclination angle and a small viewing angle measured from the rotational axis to reproduce the observed wide separation of the two peaks appeared in the pulse profiles ( daugherty & harding 1996 ) .",
    "the slot gap model ( arons 1983 ) is an extension of the polar cap model .",
    "the possibility of a high - altitude extension of the accelerator near the last - open field lines was proposed .",
    "the recent slot gap model explains the spectrum in optical to @xmath0-ray bands for the crab pulsar ( muslimov & harding 2003 , 2004 ; harding et al .",
    "2008 ) and the pulse profiles in @xmath0-ray bands for the vela pulsar ( dyks & rudak 2003 ) .",
    "the outer gap accelerator model assumes a strong acceleration between the null charge surface of the goldreich - julian charge density and the light cylinder ( cheng , ho & ruderman 1986a , b ) .",
    "the goldreich - julian charge density is described by @xmath3 with @xmath4 being the rotation frequency , @xmath5 the magnetic field component projected to the rotation axis , and @xmath6 the speed of light .",
    "the recent studies of the outer gap model also explain the spectra and pulse profiles measured by egret ( hirotani 2007 ; tang et al .",
    "2008 ; takata et al . 2008 ) .",
    "although numerous efforts have been done to discriminate emission models with @xmath0-ray data , the origin of the non - thermal emission remains inconclusive .",
    "in addition to the @xmath0-ray data of egret , emission properties in lower energy bands have also been provided .",
    "for example , harding et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found that the pulse profile of the vela pulsar in rxte bands shows four or five peaks in a single period instead of the double peak structure measured by egret .",
    "the detail polarization features of optical pulsed emissions from the crab pulsar have been measured by kanbach et al ( 2005 ) .",
    "integral also measured the polarization of the @xmath0-ray emissions from the crab pulsar for the first time ( dean et al .",
    "2008 ) . in the future ,",
    "furthermore , the polarization of x - ray and soft @xmath0-ray emissions from the crab pulsar will probably be able to be measured by ongoing projects such as pogo ( kataoka et al .",
    "2005 ) and the nuclear compton telescope ( chang et al .",
    "both the _ astro -rivelatore gamma a immagini leggero _ ( agile ) and recently lunched _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ ( fermi , hereafter ) will measure more detail features of the phase - resolved spectra and the pulse profiles in 1  mev through 100  gev bands . in particular , fermi telescope is expected to measure pulsed @xmath0-ray emissions from both many radio pulsars and from unidentified egret sources . a comprehensive theoretical study with observations in multi - wavelength bands",
    "is desired and will be important to discriminate emission models .",

    "et al . ( 2007 ) , they demonstrated that the outer gap model can explain observed polarization properties of the optical pulsed emissions from the crab pulsar .",
    "takata & chang ( 2007 ) extended their calculation of the polarization to higher energy band and predicted the results of future observations . also , they produced observed phase - resolved spectra in optical through @xmath0-ray bands for the crab pulsar .",
    "they predicted that @xmath0-ray flux on the earth from psr b0540 - 69 is about @xmath7 , which may be a target for fermi observation .",
    "takata et al .",
    "( 2008 ) discussed the emission process in optical through @xmath0-ray bands for the vela - like young pulsars . solving the electrodynamics of the outer gap",
    ", they first pointed out that inward emission by ingoing particles is an important component below 10  mev bands , while only outward emission contributes to the spectrum above 10  mev as the traditional outer gap model has assumed .",
    "they produced the observed multi - peak structure of the pulse profile in x - ray bands of the vela pulsar with the inward and the outward emissions .",
    "they predicted that the pulse profile at 1 - 10  mev has four peaks in a single period , which can be checked in future observations .",
    "we had studied the non - thermal emissions from the crab - like and the vela - like pulsars . in this paper , therefore , we discuss the non - thermal emissions from the outer gap of the middle - aged pulsars for part of the series of our studies . using a two - dimensional electrodynamic model , we will solve the accelerating electric field with electron and positron pair creation and radiation processes ( section  [ model ] ) .",
    "we will also discuss the x - ray and @xmath0-ray pulse profiles using a three - dimensional geometrical model ( section  [ geomod ] ) .",
    "we apply the outer gap model to the geminga pulsar ( section  [ gemingapul ] ) .",

    "also by assuming that the radio beam from the geminga pulsar is oriented in a different direction from the line of sight , we will further constrain the magnetic inclination angle ( section  [ radioq ] ) .",

    "-ray photons are from the outer gap region .",
    "the critical field line ( thick solid line ) is defined by the magnetic field line on which the goldreich - julian density vanishes at the light cylinder.,width=264,height=264 ]    figure  [ pulsar ] shows a schematic picture of the magnetosphere model for middle - aged pulsars . in general",
    ", we expect that the outer gap can arise between the last - open field lines and the magnetic field lines ( so called critical field lines , hereafter ) on which the goldreich - julian charge density vanishes at the light cylinder . between the rotational axis and the critical field lines ,",
    "the null charge surface is located beyond the light cylinder so that the goldreich - julian charge density does not change its sign all the way from the stellar surface to the light cylinder .",

    "the potential drop on the stellar surface between the critical magnetic field line and the polar cap rim is @xmath19 which becomes @xmath20  volt for the geminga pulsar .",
    "we can show that almost whole potential drop @xmath21 is required to explain the gev emissions from the geminga pulsar . for the geminga pulsar , a spectral cut off around 2  gev was measured ( fierro et al .",
    "we estimate whole potential drop in the gap , @xmath22 , from the cut off energy .",
    "we assume that @xmath0-ray photons are emitted via the curvature radiation , and that the particles that emit the cut off photons are accelerated by the whole potential drop along the magnetic field lines in the gap .",
    "the typical strength of the accelerating electric field is estimated from @xmath23 .",
    "we assume the force balance between the acceleration and the radiation back reaction force to calculate a typical lorentz factor of the accelerated particles ; @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the curvature radius of the magnetic field line .",
    "using the typical energy of the curvature photons @xmath26 , the estimated potential drop in the outer gap is @xmath27 where we used @xmath28 .",
    "we find that the estimated magnitude of the potential drop is comparable with the available potential drop defined by equation of ( [ drop ] ) for the geminga pulsar .",
    "the observed @xmath0-ray emissions from the geminga pulsar imply that most of the region between the last - open field lines and the critical field lines will be occupied by the outer gap for the middle - aged pulsars .    for younger pulsars",
    ", the outer gap accelerator occupies about 10  % of the whole region between the last - open field lines and the critical field lines . for example , the available potential drop defined by equation of ( [ drop ] ) for the vela pulsar becomes @xmath29  volt .",
    "the observed cut off energy around 3  gev indicates the potential drop in the gap is about @xmath30  volt .",
    "therefore , only about 10  % of the available potential drop is required to explain the @xmath0-ray emissions from the vela pulsar .    from the dynamic point of view",
    ", we can also argue that the outer gap of the middle - aged pulsars occupies most of the region between the last - open field line and the critical field line .",
    "the @xmath0-rays emitted by the accelerated particles may convert into electron and positron pairs by the pair creation process with a soft x - ray field from the stellar surface .",
    "if typical energy of the curvature photons have an energy such that the pair creation condition @xmath31 is satisfied , the outer gap can not develop further due to screening effects of the pairs .",
    "in such a case , the position of the upper boundary of the gap is determined by the pair creation condition . for the geminga pulsar , however , the pair creation in the outer magnetosphere is not efficient .",
    "the temperature of the stellar surface is about @xmath32  mk ( kargaltsev et al . 2005 ) , so the threshold energy of the @xmath0-rays for the pair creation is @xmath33gev , where @xmath34 is the boltzmann constant . from equation of ( [ drop1 ] ) , the potential drop of @xmath35  volt in the gap",
    "is required to accelerate the particles to emit 6  gev photons .",
    "however it will be impossible to accelerate the particles because the available potential drop in the outer gap @xmath36  volt estimated from equation of ( [ drop ] ) is smaller than the required potential drop for the pair creation .",
    "the particles can not be accelerated in the outer gap to emit 6  gev photons with the curvature radiation process .",
    "therefore , we expect that the outer gap of the middle - aged pulsars can develop to occupy the region between the last - open field lines and the critical field lines . as we said in the first paragraph in this section",
    ", we do not expect that the outer gap accelerator arises beyond the critical field lines , because the goldreich - julian charge density does not change its sign all the way from the stellar surface to the light cylinder    we assume that the radio emission originates from the polar cap accelerator , while the emissions in optical through @xmath0-ray bands originate from the outer gap accelerator .",
    "electrodynamically speaking , because of the different flow directions of the electric currents in the polar cap and in the outer gap , the current conservation forces that both acceleration regions do not exit on the same magnetic field lines . in this paper",
    ", we anticipate that the outer gap accelerator is extending from the last - open field line to the critical field lines , and the polar cap accelerator extends in a region between the critical field lines and the rotational axis .",
    "this assumption will be rejected if the radio emissions take place on the last - open field line .",
    "in fact , there are no observational evidences . for example , the phenomenological study with the polarization characteristics for the radio emissions ( dyks et al .",
    "2004 ) indicates that the outer rim of the radio beam is emitted on the magnetic fields located well above the last - open field lines .",
    "in this section , we briefly summarize our method of the electrodynamic study of the outer gap model .",
    "a more detail description of our model can be found in the previous paper ( takata et al .",
    "we solve the accelerating electric field with the radiation and the pair creation processes in the magnetic meridional plane , which includes the rotation axis and the magnetic axis . in the electrodynamic study",
    ", we use a static dipole field to solve the structure of the outer gap .",
    "we consider a magnetized rotator in which an inclination angle @xmath9 between the rotational axis and magnetic axis is smaller than @xmath37 .",
    "the stationary electric potential , @xmath38 , for the accelerating field in the observer frame is obtained from ( shibata 1995 ; mestel 1999 ) @xmath39 , \\label{poisson}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the space charge density , and @xmath41 is the goldreich - julian charge density , for which we use @xmath42 .    for the steady state ,",
    "the continuity equations of the particles are written as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the velocity along the field line , @xmath45 is the source term due to the pair creation process , and @xmath46 and @xmath47 denote the number density of the outgoing ( positrons ) and ingoing ( electrons ) particles , respectively . in the outer magnetosphere",
    ", @xmath48 pair creation process contributes to the source term @xmath45 .",
    "we simulate the pair creation process with a monte carlo method , which is explicitly described in takata et al .",
    "( 2004 , 2006 ) .    to solve the poisson equation ( [ poisson ] ) , we impose the boundary conditions on the four boundaries , which are called as inner , outer , upper and lower boundaries .",
    "the inner and outer boundaries are defined by the surfaces on which the accelerating electric field is vanishes , that is , @xmath49 .",
    "on the inner , upper and lower boundaries , the accelerating potential is equal to zero , that is , @xmath50 . on the inner boundary , because both conditions @xmath49 and @xmath50 are imposed , we can not know the position of the inner boundary in advance .",
    "we solve the position of the inner boundary with the dynamics .",
    "the lower boundary is defined by the last - open field line . for the upper boundary , we define with a magnetic field line . for the outer boundary , we define it with a curve line , which is perpendicular to the magnetic field lines in the magnetic meridian plane . for such a case ,",
    "the upper part of the our gap extends beyond the light cylinder , if we put the outer boundary of the lower part of the gap close to ( but inside ) the light cylinder .",
    "the present static poisson equation of ( [ poisson ] ) will not give the correct solutions for the electric field outside the light cylinder . as we will see later ( figure  [ geminga1 ] ) , however , most @xmath0-rays are emitted from the lower part of the gap .",
    "the spectral features will be less affected by the structure of the upper part of the gap .",
    "we expect that the results do not change much between the present approximated and correct treatments . to calculate the spectra , we take into account the emissions inside the light cylinder .      to calculate the synchrotron and curvature radiations , we solve an evolution of the particle s momentum using the electric field distribution in the outer gap obtained by the method described in section  [ gapst ] .",
    "the equation of motion for momenta of the parallel ( @xmath51 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath52 ) to the magnetic field lines are , respectively , described as ( harding et al .",
    "2005 ; hirotani 2006 ) @xmath53 and @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the pitch angle , @xmath56 represents the radiation drag of the synchrotron and curvature radiation , and the second term on the right hand side on equation  ( [ perpeq ] ) represents the adiabatic change along the dipole field line .",
    "the radiation drag , @xmath56 , of the synchrotron - curvature radiation is described by ( cheng & zhang 1996 ) , @xmath57 where @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60      the model parameters are the magnetic inclination angle @xmath9 and the current components @xmath61 , where @xmath62 ( or @xmath63 ) is the current carried by the positrons ( or electrons ) coming into the gap through the inner ( or outer ) boundary .",
    "we also use the outer boundary as the model parameter . as the lower boundary of the gap",
    ", we define the last - open field line .",
    "for the upper boundary of the middle age pulsars , which we discuss in the paper , we use the critical field line defined by equation of ( [ crit ] ) . setting the model parameters",
    ", we solve the position of the inner boundary , the accelerating electric field , and the current component carried by particles created in the gap .",
    "the created current , and the resultant calculated flux are determined by the value of the injected currents at the inner boundary @xmath62 and at the outer boundary @xmath63 .",
    "in fact , the magnitude of the created current is less affected by the current @xmath62 injected at the inner boundary , but is determined by @xmath63 injected at the outer boundary , because most of pairs are created between the ingoing @xmath0-rays and the outward propagating surface x - rays . in this paper",
    ", we choose the value of the component @xmath63 so that the created pairs produce the comparable @xmath0-ray flux with the observations .",
    "the created current and the @xmath0-ray flux do not monotonically increase with the current component @xmath63 .",
    "this is because an increase of the created current strengthens screening of the accelerating electric field . with a smaller electric field ,",
    "the @xmath0-ray photons with a lower energy are produced , and therefore a smaller amount of the pairs are created .",
    "namely , the increment of the created current is determined under the competition between the increase of @xmath63 and the screening of the electric field .",
    "for example ,",
    "if we assume the current @xmath64 in units of goldreich - julian value , we obtain the created current of @xmath65 for the geminga pulsar with @xmath66 .",
    "then if we double the value of @xmath63 , we find from the numerical results that the increments of the created current and the total luminosity are factors of @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "we find that the computed @xmath0-ray flux is not sensitive to the detailed values of the current components injected at the boundaries .",
    "since the magnetic field must be modified by the rotational and the plasma effects the vicinity of the light cylinder ( muslimov & harding 2005 ) , the last - open field line will be also different from the conventional magnetic surface , which is tangent to the light cylinder for the vacuum case .",
    "for example , romani ( 1996 ) assumed the last - open lines with the field lines which have the polar angle @xmath69 at the stellar surface , where @xmath70 is the conventional polar cap angle ( [ rim ] ) for static dipole field . in the studies of the force - free magnetosphere , @xmath71",
    "was obtained by contopoulos et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and @xmath72 by gruzinov ( 2005 ) . in the paper",
    ", we use @xmath71 for the last - open field lines .",
    "the position of the last - open field lines affects the accelerating electric field , spectrum and the pulse profile .",
    "for example , if we adopt a vacuum solution , the typical electric field in the gap is described as @xmath73 with @xmath74 begin the stellar magnetic field ( cheng et al .",
    "2000 ; hirotani 2006 ) .",
    "then as the last - open field line is located on the magnetic field line with a larger polar angle on the stellar surface , we obtain a stronger accelerating electric field because ( i ) the trans - field thickness of the gap , @xmath75 , becomes large and ( ii ) the typical curvature radius of the magnetic field line , on which most @xmath0-rays are emitted , becomes small . as a result , a spectrum of the radiation from the gap becomes hard .",
    "for the pulse profiles , the phase separation between two peaks becomes wide as the last - open field shift to inner magnetosphere from the canonical field line , which is tangent to the light cylinder ( takata & chang 2007 ) .",
    "in fact , the calculated @xmath0-ray spectrum and pulse profiles with the last - open field lines for @xmath71 are more consistent with the observations for the geminga pulsar than those for @xmath76 ( section  [ result ] ) .",
    "the observed pulse profile provides an important tool for diagnose the geometry of the emission region in the pulsar magnetospheres",
    ". in particular , number of the peaks in a single rotational period , positions of the peaks in the pulse profile , and morphology of the pulse profiles at different energy bands will discriminate the emission models .    in the framework of the outer gap model ( and also the slot gap model ) , the peaks appear in the pulse profiles because the photons emitted various point pileup due to the effect of the special relativity correction ; the aberration of the emitting direction and the flight time ( romani & yadigaroglu 1995 ; dyks & rudak 2003 ) . to compute the pulse profile",
    ", we anticipate that the emission direction coincides with the particle motion . in the observer frame ,",
    "the particle motion along the field lines in the north hemisphere is described by @xmath77 , where the plus ( or minus ) sign represents the outgoing ( or ingoing ) particles , @xmath78 is the velocity along the magnetic field line and is determined by the condition that @xmath79 , @xmath80 is the unit vector of the magnetic field , for which we adopt a rotating dipole field in the observer frame , @xmath81 is the co - rotating velocity , and @xmath82 is the unit vector of the azimuthal direction . the emission direction , @xmath83 , is interpreted in terms of the viewing angle @xmath84 and the pulse phase @xmath85 , where @xmath86 and @xmath87 is the azimuthal emission direction and the radial distance to the emission point , respectively .",
    "we use a rotating magnetic dipole field in the observer frame to compute the pulse profile .",
    "the distribution of emissivity affects the pulse profiles . for the distribution of the emissivity in the meridional plane",
    ", we use the results of the two - dimensional electrodynamic model , which solves the trans - field distribution of the emissivity in the magnetic meridional plane ( see section  [ lightr ] ) .",
    "for the structure of the azimuthal direction , it is difficult to model without solving a three - dimensional dynamics . for the first order approximation , however , we may apply the function form of the accelerating electric field for the vacuum solution . in the vacuum solution ,",
    "the typical value of the electric field along a field line is determined by @xmath88 with @xmath89 being the curvature radius at the null charge surface and @xmath90 the magnetic azimuthal angle of the magnetic field on the stellar surface measured from the magnetic meridional plane ( cheng el al .",
    "1986a ; cheng et al .",
    "in such a case , the number of the curvature photons emitted per second by a particle and the typical energy of the emitted photons are proportional to @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively , if we assume the force balance between the particle acceleration and the radiation drag .",

    "this indicates that the strength of the accelerating electric field becomes maximum on the magnetic field line penetrating the gap at the height of about 20% of the thickness .",
    "because the emitting power of each magnetic flux tube is proportional to the product of the current density and the potential drop at each field line , we can read that most of emissions come from the height between 20  % and 40  % of the gap thickness ( see also figure  [ geminga1 ] ) .",
