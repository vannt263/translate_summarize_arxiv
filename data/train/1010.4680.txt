    "one of the main problems that arise in theoretical description of complex fluids is the role of density fluctuations on the mesoscopic length scale .",
    "such fluctuations are not important in the case of simple fluids , and for this reason simple liquids can be accurately described by the liquid theories @xcite which focus on the microscopic length scale , whereas the long - range fluctuations are treated via mean - field ( mf ) approximation .",
    "an exception is the critical region where the long - range fluctuations dominate .",
    "universal features of the critical phenomena are described by the phenomenological landau - ginzburg - wilson ( lgw ) theory @xcite , because the field - theoretic methods allow for more accurate treatment of the dominant long - wavelength density fluctuations . in the lgw theory the microscopic structure",
    "is entirely neglected , however - the pair correlation function in the lgw theory decays monotonically .",
    "the two approaches ( i ) accurate description of the microscopic length scale and rough approximation for the long - wavelength fluctuations , and ( ii ) accurate description of the long - wavelength fluctuations with neglected microscopic structure are complementary .",
    "both , used separately , give satisfactory description of simple fluids .",
    "exact theories that are capable of description of nonuniversal features of phase transitions were also developed @xcite , but so far these theories were applied to homogeneous phases .    when there are competing tendencies in the interaction potentials , then self - assembly into different aggregates , living polymers , clusters , micelles or another objects ( supermolecules having characteristic size ) may occur .",
    "a notable example of such interactions is the effective short - range attraction long - range repulsion ( salr ) potential @xcite .",
    "in addition to the liquid order on the microscopic length scale ( described by the pair distribution function ) ordering on the mesoscopic length scale may be present in such systems .",
    "this additional ordering is associated with packing of the supermolecules in the lyotropic liquid crystalline phases . in the liquid theories , designed for description of the microscopic structure ,",
    "the presence of such additional ordering is manifested by a lack of solutions of the associated equations @xcite . on the other hand , in the landau theory modified by brazovskii the dominant fluctuations of the order parameter ( op ) are of finite wavelength  @xcite .",
    "the functional of the form postulated by brazovskii was used for a description of various amphiphilic systems @xcite , since the dominant finite - wavelength fluctuations of the abstract order parameter ( op ) can represent in particular the density fluctuations on the mesoscopic length scale . indeed ,",
    "when the values of the phenomenological parameters in the functional are properly adjusted , the lb theory predicts stability ( or metastability ) of lyotropic liquid crystalline phases observed in amphiphilic systems @xcite .",
    "one should note that in the lb theory fluctuations of the op lead to a change of the continuous transition between disordered and lamellar phases obtained in mf to weakly first order transition  @xcite which occurs at lower temperature .",
    "the long - wavelength fluctuations in the lgw theory just modify the critical exponents , whereas the order of the transition remains the same .",
    "the landau - brazovskii ( lb ) functional is quite general ( the op can have different physical meaning ) , and is expressed in terms of phenomenological parameters ( coupling constants ) whose precise relation to measurable quantities is not known - it should be derived from more fundamental microscopic theory . because the lb theory correctly describes the qualitative properties of systems self - assembling on the mesoscopic length scale , it is desirable to find a relation between the brazovskii theory and the exact statistical mechanics .",
    "the main questions are : ( i ) what is the range of validity of the lgw and lb theories ( ii ) for what kind of interaction potentials the lb rather than the lgw theory is valid ( iii ) how the phenomenological parameters are expressed in terms of thermodynamic parameters and ( effective ) interaction potential . the approximate theory derived from the statistical mechanics should allow for determination of phase diagrams and structure when the interaction potentials are known .",
    "a natural theory to start with is the density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite which allows for description of inhomogeneous systems and in principle is exact .",
    "however , the exact form of the grand potential functional is not known . in the widely used versions of the dft",
    "the contribution to the grand potential associated with interactions is of the mf type .",
    "this approximation works well for a description of the microscopic structure and away from the critical point .",
    "however , more accurate approximation for the grand potential functional is desirable when the mesoscopic scale fluctuations dominate and may affect the order and location of the phase transition to a liquid crystalline phase . on the other hand , we have to make simplifying assumptions to make the theory tractable .",
    "since we need a description of the ordering on the mesoscopic length scale , we may introduce _ mesoscopic density _ that describes the distribution of particles less accurately than the microscopic density , but more accurately than the average density .",
    "such an approach was proposed in ref.@xcite for a one component system of spherical particles .",
    "the mesoscopic density is defined as the microscopic density averaged over regions larger than the molecules and smaller than the characteristic length of ordering ( for example , the size of the clusters ) .",
    "precise definition is given for multicomponent systems in the next section .",
    "probability of spontaneous appearance of particular mesoscopic density field was derived from the statistical mechanics by integrating the probability distribution over all microscopic states under the constraint of fixed mesoscopic density field under consideration .",
    "this method is analogous to integrating the probability distribution over all microscopic states under the constraint of fixed average density in macroscopic parts of the system .",
    "the only difference is that the constraint imposed on the microscopic density has a form of the field which varies on the mesoscopic length scale .",
    "the grand potential functional of the mesoscopic density field derived in ref.@xcite consists of two terms .",
    "the first term contains contributions from fluctuations on the microscopic length scale under the constraint of fixed mesoscopic density @xmath1 .",
    "this term resembles standard dft .",
    "the second contribution is associated with mesoscopic fluctuations @xmath2 that can occur in the system when the constraint @xmath1 is removed .    in the mf approximation",
    "the contribution to the grand potential associated with mesoscopic - length scale fluctuations is neglected . in this version of mf the average density",
    "is approximated by the most probable mesoscopic density @xcite .",
    "however , in parts of the phase diagram that are close to microphase separation the fluctuation contribution can be comparable to the first term , and the average density can be significantly different from the most probable mesoscopic density .",
    "in such cases the fluctuations can not be neglected .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the relation between the systems with and without the constraint on the mesoscopic density distribution resembles the relation between the canonical and the grand canonical ensembles .",
    "there is some loose analogy between the system in the presence of the mesoscopic constraint imposed on the microscopic density distribution , and a macroscopic system with fixed number of particles @xmath3 , described by the canonical ensemble .",
    "when the constraint of compatibility between the microscopic density distribution and the mesoscopic field @xmath1 is removed and @xmath4 , then the system is analogous to the open system with fluctuating @xmath5 such that @xmath6 ( grand canonical ensemble ) .",
    "the canonical and grand canonical ensembles with @xmath7 are equivalent only far from phase transitions , when the fluctuations are small , @xmath8 .",
    "close to phase transitions the compressibility @xmath9 is large ( diverges at the transition ) , and fluctuations can not be neglected . at the phase coexistence the most probable density distribution in the open system corresponds to either the gas @xmath10 or the liquid @xmath11 density in an absence of any constraints or external fields .",
    "however , in the grand canonical ensemble the ensemble average in an absence of any constraints or external fields yields a constant density @xmath12 , although homogeneous microscopic states with such density occur with negligible probability .",
    "the difference between this case and microphase separation concerns the extent of the regions having different density ( or composition ) - mesoscopic rather than macroscopic parts of the system - and in turn the time scale associated with displacements of these regions , i.e. with the mesoscopic rather than macroscopic fluctuations . while it is justified to neglect macroscopic fluctuations in studies of coexisting homogeneous phases , in the case of microphase separation the mesoscopic fluctuations influence the experimentally observed properties of the system .",
    "the fluctuation contribution to the grand potential reduces to the form similar to the lb theory in the case of weak ordering on the length scale significantly larger than the molecular size @xcite .",
    "such kind of ordering occurs in soft - matter systems , and the results of ref . @xcite",
    "confirm validity of the lb theory for soft matter .",
    "the fluctuation contribution can be treated by field - theoretic methods , and in the theory developed in ref.@xcite the dft and field - theoretic methods are both used .    the theory developed in ref.@xcite",
    "is restricted to a one - component system , whereas the soft - matter systems are usually multicomponent .",
    "the size of solvent molecules can be several orders of magnitude smaller than the size of proteins , nanoparticles or colloids , and the solvent molecules can be taken into account only via solvent - mediated effective interactions between solute particles @xcite .",
    "however , the effectively one - component system might lead to incorrect predictions when the size ratio is not very large , and when mesoscopic fluctuations of the solvent are important .",
    "the purpose of this work is an extension of the mesoscopic dft to the case of multicomponent systems of particles of arbitrary sizes .    in sec.2 general framework of the theory for multicomponent systems",
    "is introduced by a systematic coarse - graining procedure .",
    "mesoscopic volume fractions are defined , and expressions for the grand potential and correlation functions are derived in the same section . in sec.3 approximate theory for weak",
    "ordering is developed , and the role of mesoscopic fluctuations for stability of the disordered phase is discussed .",
    "two - component systems of particles of different sizes are studied in more detail in sec.4 .",
    "the mf theory is illustrated by three simple examples .",
    "equations derived in sec.4 are of mf type , and provide information whether inhomogeneities on the mesoscopic length scale ( clusters or soft crystals ) are formed , or the system can phase separate into homogeneous phases for given interaction potentials and size ratios . in future studies",
    "the theory can be applied to different inhomogeneous systems along the lines described in sec.3 .",

    "let us summarize the above examples .",
    "when the interaction potentials between like particles are attractive for some distances and repulsive for different distances , and the fourier transform assumes a _ negative minimum _ for @xmath282 , then the system is inhomogeneous below the @xmath0-surface .",
    "such behavior was found already in one - component systems .",
    "in addition , inhomogeneous structures can occur when particles of different kind attract each other and the fourier transform of the interaction potential assumes _ positive maximum _ for @xmath282 .",
    "periodic ordering is enhanced when the size asymmetry increases , and the system becomes inhomogeneous even for low volume fractions for @xmath370 .",
    "increasing tendency for clustering with increasing size asymmetry was observed in ionic systems , in mesoscopic theory @xcite and in simulation studies @xcite .      in order to calculate the phase diagram and structure we need to calculate the correlation functions beyond mf .",
    "the explicit expressions for the inverse correlation functions in mf in principle allow for obtaining the correlation functions in the brazovskii - type approximation by self - consistent solutions of eq.([cf ] ) . in practice",
    "this is less trivial than in the one - component case @xcite .",
    "the grand potential functional of the mesoscopic volume fractions can be obtained once the matrix @xmath185 and its eigenvalues are determined from eqs.([omharval1])-([omcobr ] ) . however , even at the mf level determination of the phase diagram is not quite trivial .",
    "the problem simplifies when we restrict our considerations to phases of particular symmetry . in one - component systems the mf phase diagram was determined for weak ordering in ref.@xcite , and in two - component case",
    "one can proceed in a similar way .",
    "the fluctuation contribution to the grand potential can be obtained from eqs.([omharval1])-([omcobrg ] ) and ( [ cf ] ) .",
    "we should stress that from sec.3 it follows that the phase transitions between inhomogeneous phases are first - order .",
    "temperature at the transition is shifted compared to the mf result , because the fluctuation contribution to the grand potential in different phases is different .",
    "we developed a mesoscopic dft for inhomogeneous mixtures in terms of mesoscopic volume fractions .",
    "local volume fraction is suitable for description of inhomogeneous distribution of particles on mesoscopic length scales when particles of different species are of significantly different sizes .",
    "this is because derivation of a landau - type theory from statistical mechanics requires expansions in local deviations of the volume fraction ( or density ) from the average value .",
    "since volume fractions are less than unity regardless of the size of the particles , such expansions are justified from mathematical point of view .",
    "we performed precise coarse - graining by introducing the microscopic volume fraction , and then by averaging it over mesoscopic regions ( see eq.([me ] ) ) to obtain mesoscopic field .",
    "this field is next considered as a constraint on the microscopic states .",
    "exact expression for the grand potential consisting of two parts is obtained .",
    "the first part contains contributions from the microscopic states that are compatible with the constraint imposed on the volume fractions on the mesoscopic scale - the mesoscopic volume fraction of each component must be equal to the ensemble average .",
    "this term has a form similar to the grand potential in standard dft .",
    "the second term is the contribution resulting from mesoscopic fluctuations - that is , from microscopic states that are not compatible with the ensemble average of the volume fraction on the mesoscopic scale .",
    "this term in turn has a form similar to the landau theory .    in practice additional assumptions and approximations",
    "are necessary in order to obtain predictions for particular systems in the framework of this theory .",
    "being interested in inhomogeneities on mesoscopic length scale , we assume that ordering occurs on length scales larger than the size of particles , and adopt local density approximation for the hard - sphere reference system .",
    "the functional can be further simplified under the assumption of weak ordering , by which we mean that local deviations of the volume fraction from the space averaged value are small . under the two assumptions ,",
    "often valid in soft matter , we obtain a functional ( eqs.([omharval1])-([omcobrg ] ) , ( [ cf ] ) and ( [ a ] ) ) which is similar to an extension of the landau theory for mixtures combined with simple dft .",
    "the role of the op s is played by linear combinations of the deviations of the local volume fractions from the space - averaged values .",
    "minima of the functional correspond to equilibrium structures .",
    "all parameters in the functional are expressed in terms of the free - energy density of hard - spheres and in terms of interaction potentials which can have arbitrary form . in the case of one - component systems we obtain lgw or lb theory , when the interaction potential times the pair distribution function , @xmath371 , in fourier representation is approximated by @xmath372 the lgw and lb theories correspond to @xmath244 and @xmath230 respectively . in original lb theory the second term in eq.([ll ] ) is proportional to @xmath373 , but for @xmath374 , i.e. for dominant wave - numbers , we have @xmath375 . from the theory developed in ref.@xcite either the lgw or the lb theory",
    "is obtained as a further approximation , depending on the form of the interaction potential .",
    "we are not aware of extensions of the phenomenological lb theory to mixtures . from the theory developed in this work",
    "we can determine whether the system can separate in homogeneous phases , or whether inhomogeneous structures appear on low - temperature side of the @xmath0-surface .",
    "this information can be obtained from the form of interaction potentials and from the size ratio of the particles , by performing stability analysis of the homogeneous phase ( secs.3 and 4 ) . in landau - type theories separation into homogeneous phases or periodic ordering is an apriori assumption .    despite strong assumptions and approximations , determination of the phase diagram in this theory",
    "is not easy , but we can draw some qualitative conclusions already from the relatively simple stability analysis . from the approximate form of the inverse correlation function ( eqs.([cf ] ) and ( [ a ] ) ) it follows that instability with respect to periodic ordering ( @xmath230 ) obtained in mf is removed by mesoscopic fluctuations , as was the case also in one component systems .",
    "the @xmath0-surface corresponding to the mf instability may be a borderline between homogeneous and inhomogeneous structure of the disordered phase . for high volume fractions formation of some kind of periodic crystal",
    "can be expected on this side of the @xmath0-surface which corresponds to inhomogeneous structure . for low volume fractions",
    "we may expect formation of ordered clusters , where domains with increased and depleted volume fraction of particular components are periodically ordered .",
    "however , the clusters ( living polymers ) can have different sizes and locations in space as a result of the mesoscopic fluctuations .",
    "simple examples that illustrate the theory for two components indicate that formation of inhomogeneous distribution of particles is enhanced when the size ratio between the particles of different components increases .",
    "further work is necessary for determination of phase diagrams for particular systems within the framework of the theory developed in this work , and for verification of validity of our approximations in different experimental systems .",
    "it is important to note that formation ( or not ) of inhomogeneous distribution of particles in mixtures depends not only on the interaction potentials , but on a combined effect of interactions and size ratios . in future studies predictions of this theory for two components should be compared with predictions of the theory in which only the big particles are taken into account explicitly , and the small components lead only to solvent - mediated effective interactions .    * acknowledgments * this work is dedicated to prof .",
