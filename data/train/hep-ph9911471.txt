    "in the framework of perturbative qcd , the basic spin - averaged characteristics of heavy flavor hadro- , photo- and electroproduction are calculated up to the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) @xcite . during the last ten years",
    ", these nlo results have been widely used for a phenomenological description of available data ( for a review see @xcite ) . at the same time , the key question still remains open : how to test the applicability of qcd at fixed order to the heavy quark production ? on the one hand , the nlo corrections are large ; they increase the leading order ( lo ) predictions for both charm and bottom production cross sections approximately by a factor of 2 . for this reason",
    ", one could expect that the higher order corrections as well as the nonperturbative contributions can be essential in these processes , especially for the @xmath6-quark case . on the other hand , it is very difficult to compare directly , without additional assumptions , the pqcd predictions for spin - averaged cross sections with experimental data because of a high sensivity of the theoretical calculations to standard uncertainties in the input qcd parameters .",
    "the total uncertainties associated with the unknown values of the heavy quark mass , @xmath1 , the factorization and renormalization scales , @xmath3 and @xmath2 , @xmath4 and the parton distribution functions are so large that one can only estimate the order of magnitude of the pqcd predictions for total cross sections @xcite . in particular , at the energies of the fixed target experiments the theoretical calculations are especially sensitive to the value of the heavy quark mass which plays the role of a cutoff parameter for infrared singularities of the theory . for the shapes of the one- and two - particle differential distributions the above uncertainties are moderate in comparison with the ones for total cross sections ; however they are also significant .",
    "in fact these uncertainties are of the same order as the contributions of nonperturbative effects ( such as the primordial transverse motion of incoming partons and the hadronization phenomena ) which are usually used for a phenomenological description of the charm and bottom differential spectra @xcite .",
    "since the spin - averaged characteristics of heavy flavor production are not well defined quantitatively in pqcd it is of special interest to study those spin - dependent observables which are stable under variations of input parameters of the theory . in this paper",
    "we analyze the charm and bottom production by linearly polarized photons , namely the reactions    @xmath7    in particular , we calculate the single spin asymmetry parameter , @xmath8 , which measures the parallel - perpendicular asymmetry in the quark azimuthal distribution :    @xmath9    here d@xmath10 , @xmath11 is the degree of linear polarization of the incident photon beam , @xmath12 is the centre of mass energy of the process ( [ 1 ] ) and @xmath13 is the angle between the beam polarization direction and the observed quark transverse momentum .",
    "the main results of our analysis can be formulated as follows :    -at fixed target energies , the lo predictions for azimuthal asymmetry ( [ 2 ] ) are not small and can be tested experimentally .",
    "for instance ,    @xmath14    -the nlo corrections , both real and virtual , practically do not affect the born predictions for @xmath8 at fixed target energies .",
    "-at energies sufficiently above the production threshold , both leading and next - to - leading order predictions for @xmath8 are insensitive ( to within few percent ) to uncertainties in the qcd parameters : @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and in the gluon distribution function .",
    "this implies that theoretical uncertainties in the spin - dependent and spin - averaged cross sections ( the numerator and denominator of the fraction ( [ 2 ] ) , respectively ) cancel each other with a good accuracy .",
    "our analysis shows that the @xmath15- and @xmath16-spectra of the single spin asymmetry also depend weekly on the variations of qcd parameters . to be specific : theoretical uncertainties in the pqcd predictions for the azimuthal asymmetry differential distribution are always significantly smaller than the ones in calculations of the shape of the corresponding spectrum of unpolarized cross section .",
    "we conclude that the single spin asymmetry is an observable quantitatively well defined and rapidly convergent in pqcd .",
    "measurements of asymmetry parameters would provide a good test of the fixed order qcd applicability to charm and bottom production .",
    "another important question is how the fixed order predictions for asymmetry parameters are affected by nonperturbative contributions usually used for the description of unpolarized spectra .",
    "we estimate the nonperturbative corrections to @xmath8 due to the transverse motion of partons in the target .",
    "for this purpose we use a parametrization of the intrinsic transverse momentum distribution proposed in ref.@xcite ( so - called @xmath17-kick ) .",
    "it is shown that the @xmath17-kick corrections to the @xmath18-quark azimuthal asymmetry @xmath8 are negligible .",
    "because of the smallness of the @xmath19-quark mass , the @xmath17-kick corrections to @xmath8 in the charm case are larger ; they are of order of 20% .    modeling nonperturbative effects with the help of the @xmath17-kick and the peterson fragmentation function we analyze also the @xmath15- and @xmath16 -behavior of azimuthal asymmetry in @xmath20- and @xmath5-meson photoproduction .",
    "it is shown that for the @xmath5-meson both the @xmath17-kick and the fragmentation contributions are small almost in the whole region of kinematical variables @xmath15 and @xmath16 . for the @xmath20-meson ,",
    "the @xmath17-kick corrections are essential at low values of @xmath15 , @xmath21 , and rapidly vanish at @xmath22 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect.ii",
    "we analyze the properties of heavy quark azimuthal distributions at leading order .",
    "we also give the physical explanation of the fact that the pqcd predictions for @xmath8 are approximately the same at lo and at nlo .",
    "the details of our calculations of radiative corrections are too long to be presented in this paper ; they will be reported separately in a forthcoming publication @xcite . in sect.iii",
    "we discuss the nonperturbative contributions caused by both @xmath17-kick and peterson fragmentation mechanisms .",
    "a comparison of the qcd predictions with the regge model ones is also given .",
    "at leading order , @xmath23 , the only partonic subprocess which is responsible for heavy quark photoproduction is the two - body photon - gluon fusion :    @xmath24    the cross section corresponding to the born diagrams ( see fig.1 ) is :    @xmath25 , \\label{4}\\ ] ]    where @xmath11 is the degree of the photon beam polarization ; @xmath26 is the angle between the observed quark transverse momentum , @xmath27 , and the beam polarization direction . in ( [ 4 ] ) @xmath28 is the color factor , @xmath29tr@xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the quark charge in units of electromagnetic coupling constant .",
    "we use the following definition of partonic kinematical variables :    @xmath32    in the born approximation , the invariant cross section of the single inclusive hadronic process ,    @xmath33    can be written in the form    @xmath34    here @xmath35 describes the gluon density in a nucleon @xmath36 evaluated at a factorization scale @xmath3 . the hadronic variables are related to the partonic ones as follows :    @xmath37    in this paper we will discuss photoproduction processes only at fixed target energies . for this reason we do not take into account the contribution of so - called hadronic or resolved component of the photon .",
    "this contribution is small at the energies under consideration @xcite .    to analyze the azimuthal distributions in photoproduction ,",
    "it is convenient to use the parallel - perpendicular asymmetry parameters .",
    "apart from the quantity @xmath8 defined by ( [ 2 ] ) , we will consider also the parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 ,    @xmath40    @xmath41    which describe the dependence of azimuthal asymmetry on the transverse momentum , @xmath42 , and on the feynman variable , @xmath43 , of observed particle , respectively .",
    "the quantities @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the cross section ( [ 7 ] ) integrated over @xmath16 and over @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "the quantity @xmath47 in ( [ 2 ] ) corresponds to the cross section ( [ 7 ] ) integrated over both @xmath16 and @xmath46 .",
    "unless otherwise stated , the cteq3 m @xcite parametrization of the gluon distribution function is used .",
    "the default values of the charm and bottom mass are @xmath48 1.5 gev and @xmath49 4.75 gev ; @xmath50 300 mev and @xmath51 200 mev .",
    "the default values of the factorization scale @xmath52 chosen for the @xmath8 asymmetry calculation are @xmath53 for the case of charm production and @xmath54 for the bottom case @xcite . calculating the @xmath15- and @xmath16 -dependent",
    "asymmetries @xmath55 and @xmath56 , we use @xmath57 for charm and @xmath58 for bottom . for the renormalization scale ,",
    "@xmath59 , we use @xmath60 .",
    "let us discuss the pqcd predictions for the asymmetry parameters defined by ( [ 2 ] ) , ( [ 10 ] ) and ( [ 11 ] ) .",
    "our calculations of @xmath8 at lo for the @xmath19- and @xmath18-quark are presented by solid lines in fig.2 and fig.3 , respectively .",
    "one can see that at energies sufficiently above the production threshold the single spin asymmetry @xmath61 depends weekly on @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "the most interesting feature of lo predictions for @xmath61 is that they are practically insensitive to uncertainties in qcd parameters . in particular , changes of the charm",
    "quark mass in the interval 1.2 @xmath64 1.8 gev affect the quantity @xmath61 by less than 6% at energies 40 @xmath65 1000 gev .",
    "remember that analogous changes of @xmath66 lead to variations of total cross sections from a factor of 10 at @xmath67 40 gev to a factor of 3 at @xmath67 1 tev .",
    "the extreme choices @xmath49 4.5 and @xmath49 5 gev lead to 3% variations of the parameter @xmath68 in the case of bottom production at energies 250 @xmath65 1000 gev . the total cross sections in this case vary from a factor of 3 at @xmath69 250 gev to a factor of 1.5 at @xmath67 1 tev .",
    "the changes of @xmath61 are less than 3% for choices of @xmath3 in the range @xmath70 . for the total cross sections , such changes of @xmath3 lead to a factor of 2.7 at @xmath67 250 gev and of 1.7 at @xmath67 1 tev .",
    "we have verified also that all the cteq3 versions of the gluon distribution function @xcite as well as the cmkt parametrization @xcite lead to asymmetry predictions which coincide with each other with accuracy better than 1.5% .",
    "gev , changes of the charm quark mass in the interval 1.2 @xmath641.8 gev lead to 100% variations of the qcd predictions for @xmath8 . ]    in the born approximation scaling holds : with a good accuracy the quantity @xmath8 is a function of the variable @xmath71 , @xmath72 , so that    @xmath73    the scaling behavior of @xmath74 ( i.e. its independence of @xmath75 ) is demonstrated in fig.4 ) does not contradict to eq.([2an ] ) . as one can see from fig.4 , the asymmetry parameter @xmath76 is not a monotonic function of variable @xmath77 .",
    "so , eq.([1an ] ) reflects only the fact that @xmath78 . ] .    in fig.5/fig.6",
    "we show by a solid line the lo predictions for the @xmath46-/@xmath79-dependent parameter @xmath55/@xmath80 describing the azimuthal asymmetry in charm / bottom production .",
    "@xmath15-distributions grow rapidly with @xmath15 up to @xmath81 and fall slowly as @xmath15 becomes larger than the heavy quark mass .",
    "the dependence of @xmath15-spectra on variations of @xmath1 is shown in fig.7 and fig.8 .",
    "one can see that , contrary to @xmath8 , the form of the @xmath46-spectrum is sensitive to the value of charm quark mass .",
    "note however that variations of the @xmath55 shape due to changes of @xmath66 are significantly smaller than the corresponding ones for the unpolarized distribution @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "we have also verified that a change in the other input parameters has practically no effect on the computed values of @xmath83 for both charm and bottom .    in the born approximation",
    "the @xmath15-distribution of azimithal asymmetry is practically a function of two variables : @xmath72 and @xmath84 .",
    "the function @xmath85 at different values of @xmath71 is shown in fig.9 .",
    "we have calculated also the dependence of single spin asymmetry on @xmath16 .",
    "the lo predictions for @xmath86 defined by ( [ 11 ] ) in the case of @xmath19- and @xmath18-quark production are presented by solid lines in fig.10 and fig.11 , respectively .",
    "@xmath16-distributions take their maximal values approximatelly at @xmath87 0.5 and fall to zero as @xmath881 .",
    "let us briefly discuss the nlo corrections to the single spin asymmetry @xmath8 .",
    "it is well known that , at order @xmath89 , the main heavy quark photoproduction mechanism is the real gluon emission in the photon - gluon fusion :    @xmath90    according to the analysis @xcite , practically whole contribution to the heavy quark production in photon - hadron reactions at fixed target energies , @xmath91 tev , originetes from the so - called initial - state gluon bremsstrahlung ( isgb ) mechanism which is due to the feynman diagrams with the @xmath92-channel gluon exchange ( see fig.12 ) .",
    "since the gluon distribution function increases very steeply at small @xmath93 , @xmath94 , the order-@xmath95 photon - hadron cross section is determined at @xmath91 tev by the threshold , @xmath96 , behavior of the @xmath97 cross section . near the threshold , a large logarithmic enhancement of the @xmath92-channel",
    "gluon exchange diagrams contribution takes place in the collinear , @xmath98 , and soft , @xmath99 , limits @xcite .",
    "effectively , the isgb contribution is proportional to the born @xmath97 differential cross section :    @xmath100    where @xmath101 is an enhancement factor .",
    "since the azimuthal angle @xmath13 is the same for both @xmath97 and @xmath102 centre of mass systems in the collinear and soft limits , it seems natural to expect that the eq.([ku ] ) can be generalized to the spin - dependent case substituting the spin - averaged cross sections in ( [ ku ] ) by the @xmath103-dependent ones .",
    "indeed , the threshold enhancement of the isgb mechanism is due to the gluon propagator pole in the diagrams in fig.12 which is a common factor for both spin - dependent and spin - independent amplitudes .",
    "it is well known that the shapes of differential cross sections of heavy quark production in photon - hadron reactions are not sensitive to radiative corrections @xcite .",
    "for instance , the normalized quantity @xmath104 where @xmath105d@xmath106 and @xmath42 , is practically the same at lo and at nlo .",
    "this fact means that non - small contributions of the enhancement factor @xmath101 ( nlo corrections ) to the @xmath15-dependent and to the @xmath15-integrated photon - hadron cross sections , @xmath107d@xmath108d@xmath109 , cancel each other in the ratio ( [ 19 ] ) with a good accuracy .",
    "one can assume that the same situation takes place also for the single spin asymmetry which is a ratio of the @xmath103-dependent cross section to the @xmath103-averaged one .",
    "our calculations show that it is really the case .",
    "radiative corrections , both real and virtual , to the photon - gluon fusion mechanism practically do not affect the born predictions for the single spin asymmetry in heavy flavor photoproduction at fixed target energies . moreover the azimuthal asymmetry is independent ( to within few percent ) of the theoretical uncertainties in the qcd input parameters ( @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) at nlo too .",
    "the details of our nlo analysis are too long to be presented here and will be given in a separate publication @xcite .",
    "as to the photon - quark fusion , @xmath112 , the dominant production mechanism in this reaction is the so - called flavor exitation ( fe ) , also arising from the diagrams with the @xmath113channel gluon exchange in fig.12 .",
    "however the contribution of the fe mechanism may be essential at superhigh energies only @xcite .",
    "for instance , the contribution of the @xmath114 reactions to the unpolarized bottom photoproduction makes only 5 - 10% from the contribution of the @xmath97 processes at @xmath115 1 tev .",
    "it is evident that an account of the photon - quark reactions can not affect significantly the predictions of the photon - gluon fusion mechanism at fixed target energies in the polarized case too .",
    "let us discuss how the pqcd predictions for single spin asymmetry are affected by nonperturbative contributions due to the intrinsic transverse motion of the gluon and the fragmentation of produced heavy quark .",
    "because of the @xmath19-quark low mass , these contributions are especially important in the case of charmed particle production . in our analysis",
    ", we use the mnr model @xcite parametrization of the gluon transverse momentum distribution ,    @xmath116    according to @xcite , the primordial transverse momentum , @xmath117 , has a random gaussian distribution :    @xmath118    where @xmath119 .",
    "it is evident that the inclusion of this effect results in a dilution of azimuthal asymmetry . in @xcite , the parametrization ( [ 12 ] )",
    "( so - called @xmath17-kick ) together with the peterson fragmentation function @xcite ,    @xmath120 ^{2 } } \\label{13}\\ ] ]    ( where @xmath121 is fixed by the condition @xmath122d@xmath123 ) , have been used to describe the single inclusive spectra and the @xmath124 correlations in photo- and hadroproduction at nlo .",
    "it was shown that the available data on charm photoproduction allow to choose for the averaged intrinsic transverse momemtum , @xmath125 , any value between 0.5 and 2 gev@xmath126 .",
    "our calculations of the parameter @xmath8 at lo with the @xmath17-kick contributions are presented in fig.2 and fig.3 by dashed ( @xmath127 0.5 gev@xmath126 ) and dotted ( @xmath127 1 gev@xmath126 ) curves .",
    "one can see that in the @xmath19 -quark case the @xmath17-kick reduces the value of @xmath8 approximately by 15% at @xmath128 0.5 gev@xmath126 and by 20% at @xmath128 1 gev@xmath126 .",
    "the @xmath17 -kick corrections to the bottom asymmetry are systematically smaller ; they do not exceed 5% for both @xmath128 0.5 gev@xmath126 and @xmath128 1 gev@xmath126 .",
    "nonperturbative contributions to the @xmath15-dependent asymmetry parameters @xmath83 and @xmath129 are shown in fig.5 and fig.6 .",
    "it is seen that the @xmath17-kick corrections decrease rapidly with the increase of the heavy quark transverse mass . for the @xmath5-meson , they are negligibly small in the whole region of @xmath15 . in the case of a @xmath20 -meson production ,",
    "the @xmath17-kick corrections are essential only in the region of low @xmath21 .    calculating the hadronization effect contributions we use for the parameter @xmath130 that characterizes the peterson fragmentation function the values @xmath131 0.06 for a @xmath20-meson and @xmath132 0.006 for a @xmath5-meson @xcite . strictly speaking , according to the factorization theorems",
    ", the application of the fragmentation function formalism can only be justified in the region of high @xmath15 .",
    "it is seen from fig.5 and fig.6 that for @xmath133 the account of the fragmentation function ( [ 13 ] ) leads to a reduction of the @xmath79-spectra .",
    "fragmentation corrections to @xmath55 are of order of 15% in the case of a charmed meson production ; they are less than 5% for a @xmath5-meson case .    for completeness , in fig.10 and fig.11 we presented nonperturbative contributions to the @xmath16-distributions of single spin asymmetry .",
    "one can see that the @xmath17-kick corrections to @xmath134 in the bottom case are small in the whole region of @xmath16 . as expected , the @xmath16-distribution of the @xmath19-quark azimuthal asymmetry is more sensitive to the @xmath17-kick corrections .",
    "so , we can conclude that nonperturbative corrections to the @xmath18-quark asymmetry parameters ( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ 10 ] ) due to the @xmath17-kick and peterson fragmentation effects practically do not affect predictions of the underlying perturbative mechanism : photon - gluon fusion .    to illustrate how strongly the azimuthal distributions depend on the basic subprocess dynamics let us consider the mechanisms of the photon fusion with nonvector primordials .",
    "the latter can be nonperturbative , color or white objects ( say , reggeons at @xmath135 0 ) . in the born approximation ,",
    "the partonic cross sections corresponding to the reactions    @xmath136    have the following form :    @xmath137 ,   \\label{16}\\ ] ]    @xmath138    where the cross sections @xmath139 and @xmath140 describe the photon fusion with a scalar @xmath141 and a pseudoscalar @xmath142 object , respectively .",
    "one can see from ( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ 16]),([17 ] ) that only the gluon contribution leads to a positive azimuthal asymmetry . in the case of a scalar primordial , the asymmetry parameters",
    "are predicted to be negative . the photon fusion with a pseudoscalar object ( say , @xmath143-meson ) leads to an @xmath13 -independent cross section .",
    "note that the expressions ( [ 16]),([17 ] ) do not correspond to any concrete models ; they are presented only as illustrative exercises demonstrating how the azimuthal distribution reflects the nature of the underlying subprocess .    completing the section",
    "let us compare the qcd predictions for a @xmath20-meson single spin asymmetry with the regge pole model ones .",
    "in principle , at arbitrary values of variables @xmath16 and @xmath15 , the spin dependent part of a @xmath20-meson photoproduction cross section can be of two types .",
    "the first , @xmath144\\vec{p}_{t}\\right| ^{2}=\\vec{p}_{t}^{\\hspace{0.02in}2}\\sin ^{2}\\varphi $ ] , corresponds to the contribution of the @xmath92-channel exchanges with natural spin - parity while the second , @xmath145 , describes the contribution of the @xmath92-channel singularities of unnatural spin - parity . in the above expressions",
    ", @xmath146 is the polarization vector of the photon , @xmath147 is a unit vector in the direction of the photon momentum and @xmath13 is the azimuthal angle of the @xmath20-meson momentum about @xmath147 : @xmath148\\vec{p}_{t})/(\\vec{e}\\vec{p}_{t})$ ] . really , the regge pole model is only applicable in the narrow region @xmath149 and @xmath150 ( so - called triple reggeon exchange limit ) . in this region ,",
    "the cross section of the inclusive reaction is determined by the contribution of the leading ( rightmost in the @xmath151-plane ) regge trajectory .",
    "the diagram , which describes the pseudoscalar meson photoproduction in the triple reggeon exchange limit , is sketched in fig.13 . since the relevant leading regge trajectory , @xmath152 , is of natural spin - parity , the spin structure of the corresponding reggeon - particle vertex , @xmath153 ,",
    "is written as :    @xmath154\\vec{p}_{t}\\right| ^{2}= \\frac{1}{2}\\vec{p}_{t}^{\\hspace{0.02in}2}\\left ( 1-\\cos 2\\varphi \\right ) .",

    "in the investigation of mechanisms which are responsible for heavy flavor production at fixed target energies , the reactions ( [ 1 ] ) with a linearly polarized photon beam are of special interest . as it is shown in the present paper , the qcd lo predictions for the single spin asymmetry in both charm and bottom production",
