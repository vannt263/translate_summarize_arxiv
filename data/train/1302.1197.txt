    "studies of gas- and dust - rich , starbursting agn host galaxies out to cosmological distances are important to better understand the connection between supermassive black hole and stellar bulge growth in galaxies that gives rise to the present - day @xmath7@xmath10 relation ( magorrian et al .",
    "@xcite ; hring & rix @xcite ) . a particularly important cosmic epoch for these studies is the redshift range 2@xmath11@xmath0@xmath113 where most of the growth of stellar and black hole mass in galaxies occurs , i.e. , where the volume densities of both cosmic star formation and agn activity peak ( e.g. , magnelli et al .  @xcite ; richards et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "it has recently been found that the dynamical masses of some of the most distant quasars at @xmath0@xmath124 appear to be too small to host stellar components as expected from the local @xmath7@xmath13 relation , and that the available gas masses are too small to produce a sufficient amount of stars to approach this relation ( e.g. , walter et al .",
    "@xcite ; riechers et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , these galaxies appear to require a source of external gas supply ( or stars ) to assemble sufficient stellar mass by @xmath0=0 to approach the local @xmath7@xmath13 relation",
    ". this gas supply could either be due to accretion of gas through cold streams ( e.g. , dekel et al .",
    "@xcite ) , or due to gas - rich , gas - rich ( `` wet - wet '' ) or gas - rich , gas - poor ( `` wet - dry '' ) mergers with massive and/or gas - rich galaxies ( e.g. , springel et al.@xcite ) .",
    "examples of the latter may be found among high - redshift , submillimeter - selected quasars .",
    "a strong submillimeter detection is suggestive of a large amount of warm dust heated by young stars formed at high rates ( e.g. , isaak et al .",
    "follow - up observations of the molecular interstellar medium ( ism ) in these galaxies , typically through the detection of co lines , are important to measure the mass of the ism that constitutes the reservoir for star formation , and to confirm that the starburst and gas are at the same redshift as the agn ( e.g. , coppin et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "a particularly interesting submillimeter - selected quasar was found in the field of the @xmath0=0.088 galaxy cluster abell478 , smmj04135 + 10277 at @xmath0=2.837@xmath140.003 ( knudsen et al.@xcite ) .",
    "the source was identified in 450 and 850@xmath15 m observations with the jcmt / scuba instrument , revealing high submillimeter fluxes of 25@xmath142.8 and 55@xmath1417mjy , respectively , which suggest a total infrared luminosity of ( 2.9@xmath140.5)@xmath210@xmath16 .",
    "subsequent interferometric  observations at 15@xmath3@xmath211@xmath3 resolution and single - dish  observations revealed a massive molecular gas reservoir at @xmath0=2.846@xmath140.002 , consistent with both the redshift and position of the quasar within the relative uncertainties ( hainline et al.@xcite ; riechers et al .",
    "none of these past studies offered sufficient spatial resolution to spatially resolve and/or precisely locate the co or submillimeter continuum emission .",
    "we here report higher spatial resolution  observations with carma to determine the size and dynamical mass of the molecular gas reservoir .",
    "we use a concordance , flat @xmath17cdm cosmology throughout , with @xmath18=71mpc@xmath19 , @xmath20=0.27 , and @xmath21=0.73 ( spergel @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we observed the  transition line ( @xmath22ghz , redshifted to 89.911ghz , or 3.33 mm ) towards smmj04135 + 10277 , using carma . a total bandwidth of 3.7ghz ( @xmath112,400 ; at 5.208mhz resolution ) was used to cover the  line and the underlying 3.33 mm ( rest - frame 870@xmath15 m ) continuum emission .",
    "observations were carried out under good 3 mm weather conditions for 3tracks in c configuration ( 18367 m baselines , which corresponds to probing spatial scales of 1.5@xmath331@xmath3 , or 11250kpc ) on 2012 february 25 , 29 , and march 12 .",
    "this resulted in 6.3hr of 15 antenna - equivalent on - source time after discarding unusable visibility data .",

    "fluxes were bootstrapped relative to mars .",
    "the bright nearby calibrators 3c84 and j0423013 were observed for bandpass calibration , yielding @xmath115% calibration accuracy .",
    "the miriad package was used for data reduction and analysis .",

( @xcite ) suggest that this ratio is likely typically @xmath14@xmath2 lower at @xmath0@xmath12 . in the following , we thus assume a stellar mass of @xmath59@xmath62@xmath210@xmath5  for the quasar host galaxy . approximating the total mass of the system as @xmath60=@xmath7+@xmath59+@xmath54+@xmath61+@xmath62@xmath63@xmath210@xmath5  ( adopting a gas - to - dust ratio of 100 , and assuming a contribution from dark matter ( dm ) of 25% ) , we find a gas fraction of @xmath63=@xmath47/@xmath60@xmath368% ( assuming the same gas excitation as for the co - detected galaxy ) .",

    "we estimate the total mass of the smmj04135 + 10277 system to be @xmath98.6@xmath210@xmath5  ( with considerable uncertainty ) , which may be dominated by the gas - rich companion galaxy ( mass ratio of @xmath11.9 ) .",
    "gas - rich companions have been detected in other high-@xmath0 quasars as well , such as the @xmath0=4.4 and 4.7 systems bri13350417 ( which is already actively merging with its companion on 5kpc scales ; riechers et al .",

    "starburst galaxy pair smmj04135 + 10277 could be the first high redshift example of an early - stage gas - rich , gas - poor merger , in which the optically faint submillimeter galaxy provides the gas supply to further build up the stellar component of the quasar host .",
    "models of hierarchical structure formation ( e.g. , springel et al.@xcite ) lend support to the idea that a close massive galaxy pair like smmj04135 + 10277 will likely result in a major merger in which the gas - rich companion may replenish the gas supply in the quasar host ( which perhaps will yield configurations similar to those observed in nearby infrared - luminous galaxies in intermediate or late merger stages that contain both agn and gas - rich galaxy components ; e.g. , evans et al .",
    "the relatively large projected separation of @xmath940kpc suggests that the two massive galaxies are likely physically related and gravitationally interacting , but can not ( yet ) be considered part of a common gravitational potential .",
    "this is consistent with what is expected for a merging system in an early stage .",
    "given the early phase in the merging process implied by this scenario , it is plausible but not unambiguous to assume that the ongoing black hole accretion in the quasar and star formation in the gas - rich companion could have been triggered by interaction .",
    "submillimeter - selected high redshift quasars are good candidates for transition objects from hyper - luminous infrared galaxies to optically bright quasars , linking the most intense starbursts in the universe the the most actively accreting black holes ( e.g. , coppin et al.@xcite ; simpson et al .",
    "this scenario would be consistent with a high redshift analogue of the ulirg ",
    "quasar transition scenario proposed by sanders et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "however , despite being a good candidate for a transition object initially , smmj04135 + 10277 is not an example of such sources . instead",
    ", our observations suggest that it is a good candidate for an early - stage gas - rich , gas - poor ( `` wet - dry '' ) merger of two massive galaxies at @xmath0=2.8 , and thus , a possibly more extreme high - redshift analogue to the @xmath0=0.3 quasars he04502958 and j1821 + 643 ( which were identified to not be transition objects through similar observational strategies ; e.g. , papadopoulos et al.@xcite ; aravena et al .",

    "gas - rich , gas - poor ( `` wet - dry '' ) mergers at high redshift are predicted by cosmological simulations of hierarchical structure formation ( e.g. , springel et al .",
    "@xcite ) , but successful observations of such systems are still scarce .",
    "based on the discovery of smmj04135 + 10277 alone , it remains unclear what the incidence of such systems within submillimeter - selected quasar samples is .",
    "it however clearly motivates observations of larger samples with high - quality optical / infrared data in co and submillimeter continuum emission at high spatial resolution .",
