    "open dielectric resonators are used in a large variety of applications , ranging from radio frequency and millimeter - wave applications @xcite to microlasers @xcite . therefore , accurate model predictions for their spectra and field distributions are of great interest .",
    "especially microlasers have received much attention lately in optical telecommunication , as sensors or as billiard models @xcite .",
    "these devices typically consist of a flat cylindrical dielectric resonator with a cross section of arbitrary shape which contains the active medium .",
    "the resonators are usually made of semiconductor @xcite or organic materials @xcite and are sandwiched between two media of lower index of refraction like air or a substrate .",
    "the exact shape of the resonator is important in view of the applications , because it determines the emission properties like the directionality of radiation and the quality factors of the resonances @xcite . in general ,",
    "even simple geometries like a flat dielectric disk with a height much smaller than the planar extension can not be solved analytically . since the numerical solution of the three - dimensional ( 3d ) vectorial maxwell equations describing such resonators is complicated and computationally demanding , suitable approximations are favorable .",
    "one widely used approximation is the reduction of the full 3d maxwell equations to a two - dimensional ( 2d ) , scalar helmholtz equation by introducing a so - called effective index of refraction @xmath0 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this 2d - approximation seems natural due to the flat shape with large extension in the plane of the microlasers , but to our knowledge its validity and precision has never been rigorously tested .",
    "the aim of the work presented here is thus the comparison of the experimentally measured resonance frequencies and widths with those calculated using this 2d - approximation , called the @xmath0-model in the following .",
    "although motivated by microlasers working in the infrared to the optical spectrum , our experimental setup consists of a flat cylindrical microwave resonator made of teflon ( from the company grnberg kunststoffe gmbh ) .",
    "microwave experiments have distinct experimental advantages , and therefore are commonly used for the investigation of 2d quantum billiards @xcite and also 2d dielectric resonators @xcite .",
    "the results from the microwave resonators can , however , be directly applied to microcavities by scaling .",
    "the plan of the present article is the following . in section",
    "[ sec : neff ] , the concept of an effective index of refraction is introduced and section [ sec : dielcircle ] explains how dielectric resonators are modeled with it . the experimental setup is detailed in section [ sec : expsetup ] , and the experimental data are compared to the model calculations for two disks of different thickness in sections [ sec : hkreis ] and [ sec : ngkreis ] .",
    "finally , the results are discussed in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "the basic idea for the 2d - approximation is to treat the bulk of the resonator as a dielectric slab waveguide @xcite . in this section",
    "we will consider an infinite dielectric slab waveguide , that is an infinite dielectric plate of thickness @xmath1 with index of refraction @xmath2 surrounded by media with lower indices of refraction @xmath3 ( see ) , and treat the cylindrical sidewalls of the resonator in the next section .",
    "the surrounding media are assumed to be air ( @xmath4 ) in the following .",
    "the waveguide is described by the vectorial helmholtz equation @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the vacuum - wavenumber , @xmath7 the angular frequency and @xmath8 the speed of light .",
    "the helmholtz equation ( [ eq : helmholtz_vec ] ) can be simplified by separation of the variable parallel to the cylinder axis , @xmath9 , from the @xmath10 and @xmath11 variables .",
    "different modes in the slab waveguide can be distinguished by their polarization and their excitation perpendicular to the plane of the slab . due to the slab geometry",
    "all field modes are either related to @xmath12 ( tm - polarization ) or to @xmath13 ( te - polarization ) @xcite .",
    "the general ansatz for @xmath12 respectively @xmath13 is @xmath14 and the constants @xmath15 are determined from the boundary conditions .",
    "the wave function @xmath16 satisfies the scalar , two - dimensional helmholtz equation @xmath17 with @xmath18 being the horizontal component of the wavevector .",
    "the vacuum - wavenumbers @xmath19 and its vertical components @xmath20 inside the dielectric medium and @xmath21 outside are related by the dispersion relation @xmath22 it should be noted that @xmath21 is real for all solutions which correspond to modes confined inside the dielectric slab by total internal reflection with evanescent fields outside .",
    "the continuity condition for @xmath23 and @xmath24 at the interfaces at @xmath25 for tm - modes and @xmath13 and @xmath26 for te - modes yields the condition @xcite @xmath27 expressing the horizontal component @xmath18 of the wavevector in terms of the effective index of refraction @xmath0 , defined as @xmath28 in and leads to the dispersion relation @xmath29 for @xmath0 with @xmath30 denoting the order of excitation in @xmath9-direction . since in the following only @xmath31 and @xmath32 modes are considered , we skip the index .",
    "obviously , @xmath0 depends only on the index of refraction @xmath2 and on @xmath33 , that means on the ratio of the slab s thickness @xmath1 to the wavelength @xmath34 .",
    "a plot of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath35 is shown in .",
    "the effective index of refraction is always @xmath36 .",
    "modes with @xmath9-excitation @xmath37 emerge at the cutoff @xmath38 .",
    "the solution of @xmath0 is now inserted into , leading to the two - dimensional scalar helmholtz equation @xmath39 with @xmath16 corresponding to @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) for tm- ( te- ) modes .",
    "this equation correctly describes the propagation of electromagnetic waves inside an infinite dielectric slab . the next step is to incorporate the cylindrical sidewalls of the dielectric resonator in a plane perpendicular to the cylinder axis . in the 2d approximation",
    "this is achieved by considering the vertical walls as a part of an infinite dielectric cylinder with @xmath40 and imposing the corresponding boundary conditions @xcite , i.e.  that fields inside and outside the resonator obey the helmholtz equation @xmath41 here @xmath42 is the domain of the resonator in a plane perpendicular to the cylinder axis , and the conditions along the boundary @xmath43 of @xmath42 @xmath44 are imposed , with @xmath45 equal to @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) for tm- ( te- ) modes and @xmath48 being the unit vector normal to the surface .",
    "the set of equations ( [ eq : helmholtz_neff ] ) and ( [ eq : neff_bcs ] ) constitutes the quintessence of the @xmath0-model .",
    "it correctly describes a two - dimensional dielectric resonator , i.e. the electromagnetic field is homogeneous in the @xmath9-direction , with index of refraction equal to @xmath0 , however , not a flat but three - dimensional resonator .",
    "indeed the full 3d maxwell equations lead to additional boundary conditions if the electromagnetic fields depend on @xmath9 @xcite , which couple the tm- and te - polarizations .",
    "analytical calculations incorporating these have to our knowledge not yet been performed . as has already been stated above , the aim of the present work is to test experimentally the applicability of the @xmath0-model and to understand the order of magnitude of deviations from the experiment .",
    "the solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : helmholtz_neff ] ) and ( [ eq : neff_bcs ] ) for a circular resonator with radius @xmath49 are given in cylindrical coordinates @xmath50 and @xmath51 as @xmath52 inside the disk and as @xmath53 outside .",
    "here , @xmath54 is a bessel - function of the first kind , @xmath55 a hankel - function of the first kind and @xmath56 the azimuthal quantum number .",
    "all modes with @xmath57 are doubly degenerate . applying the boundary conditions ( )",
    "leads to the quantization condition @xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the derivatives with respect to @xmath10 . for each azimuthal quantum number @xmath56",
    ", there is an infinite series of complex solutions @xmath61 ; @xmath62 is the radial quantum number . since a dielectric resonator described by equations ( [ eq : helmholtz_neff ] ) and ( [ eq : neff_bcs ] ) is an open system , its modes have losses due to radiation",
    "these are determined by the imaginary part of @xmath61 , and the quality factor @xmath63 of a mode is defined as @xmath64 because of these losses , the solutions of are called quasi - bound modes . they are identified as the poles of the scattering matrix @xmath42 describing the measurement process @xcite  microwave power is coupled into the resonator via an antenna , thereby exciting modes , and coupled out via the same or another antenna  in the form of resonances in the frequency spectrum .",
    "the quantization condition is solved numerically , taking into account the dependence of @xmath0 on ( the real part of ) @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath65 ghz : tm @xmath66    @xmath67 ghz : tm @xmath68    @xmath69 ghz : tm @xmath70    the experimental setup is sketched in : the teflon disk is hanging on three metal suspensions attached to the disk at the corners of an equilateral triangle , but otherwise surrounded only by air .",
    "two antennas are put on opposite sides of the disk .",
    "the whole setup is placed in a thermostat to keep it at a fixed temperature .",
    "it should be noted that the perturbation of the resonator due to the attached suspensions leads to negligible changes of the resonance frequencies by less than 2% of the mean resonance spacing .",
    "the perturbations due to the bending of the resonator under its own weight and the antennas are of the same order of magnitude",
    ". two different types of antennas ( see ) were used : vertical dipole antennas , which excite mainly tm - modes , and so - called curved antennas , which excite mainly te - modes .",
    "the antennas may slightly lift the degeneracy of the modes . a vectorial network analyzer ( pna n5230a by agilent technologies )",
    "is used to measure the scattering matrix element @xmath71 , where the modulus squared of @xmath71 is the ratio @xmath72 between the power @xmath73 coupled in by antenna @xmath46 and the power @xmath74 coupled out by antenna 2 for a given frequency @xmath75 .",
    "two circular disks of different thickness @xmath1 made of teflon were used in the experiments to investigate the dependence of the resonance frequencies on the thickness .",
    "disk a has a radius of and a thickness of , and disk b of and of .",
    "a frequency of @xmath76 ghz corresponds to @xmath77 , and @xmath78 ( disk a ) and @xmath79 ( disk b ) , respectively .",
    "the index of refraction was measured using a split - cylinder resonator @xcite and is for disk a and for disk b. an example of a measured frequency spectrum of disk a ( with dipole antennas ) is shown in .",
    "it displays a superposition of several series of almost equidistant resonances , each corresponding to modes with a fixed polarization and radial quantum number @xmath80 and ascending azimuthal quantum number @xmath56 .",
    "the resonance spacing for each of these subspectra is typically .",
    "this is illustrated in the lower part of . within each subspectrum",
    ", the width of the resonances decreases with increasing azimuthal quantum number .",
    "this can be explained within the ray picture @xcite : a higher azimuthal quantum number corresponds to a higher angular momentum , and this to rays with a larger angle of incidence at the boundary , implying lower radiation losses . as a consequence ,",
    "different subspectra are distinguishable only above a certain frequency and contribute below only to the background .",
    "the dependence of the amplitude of a resonance on the type of antenna used gives a hint at the polarization of the mode .",
    "it was determined in addition with a perturbation technique : a metal plate was introduced parallel to the teflon disk ( with varying distance ) leading to a shift of the resonance frequencies . due to the different boundary conditions for te- ( dirichlet for @xmath13 ) and tm- ( neumann for @xmath12 ) modes at the metal plate the former are shifted to lower , the latter to higher frequencies with decreasing distance between the metal plate and the disk .",
    "the quantum numbers were determined from the intensity distributions , which were measured with the perturbation body method @xcite .",
    "a cylinder made of magnetic rubber @xcite was used as perturbation body and moved along the surface of the disk , its height of and diameter of being small compared to a vacuum - wavelength of at .",
    "then the positioning of the perturbation body on the disk leads to a shift of the resonance frequency which is proportional to the electric field intensity at its position .",
    "three examples are shown in .",
    "all the measured modes are of whispering gallery mode type . as a result",
    "the resonances are only slightly perturbed by the suspensions , since they are located well inside the caustic of the whispering gallery modes .",
    "accordingly , the intensities were measured only in the outer part of the disk . with the knowledge of the polarization and the quantum numbers ,",
    "the measured resonance frequencies can be compared with those computed based on the @xmath0-model ( solutions of ) .",
    "figure [ fig : fe - ft_hkreis ] shows the difference between the measured resonance frequencies @xmath81 of disk a ( thick ) and those calculated with , @xmath82 . in ( te - modes ) , there are two series of data points for each radial quantum number @xmath80 because the degeneracy of the modes is lifted by the curved antennas used in the measurement .",
    "the scattering of the data points of about in both graphs stems from problems with the determination of the resonance frequencies , either because the resonances are badly shaped ( at lower frequencies ) or because of overlapping resonances ( at higher frequencies ) .",
    "some resonances are not detectable due to the overlap with others .",
    "the deviation between the measured and computed resonance frequencies is generally less than 1% .",
    "still , these deviations of the model calculations from the experimental data must be considered significant : a deviation of @xmath83 mhz is about half the resonance spacing between resonances with the same @xmath80 , and thus it is impossible to correctly identify the different resonances just by a comparison with the model calculations .",
    "the difference between the calculated and the measured resonance frequencies decreases with increasing frequency for both polarizations and seems to reach a finite value in both cases .",
    "interestingly , this value is different for te- and tm - modes .",
    "furthermore , the magnitude of the deviations slightly depends on the radial quantum number , especially for the te - modes .",
    "all this hints at a systematic failure of the model , even in the semiclassical , i.e.  high frequency limit , although the decrease of the deviations with increasing frequency indicates that the @xmath0-model is more accurate in the semiclassical regime .",
    "it should be noted that the magnitude of deviations between model and experiment is extremely sensitive to the exact value of the index of refraction , which has been determined with an uncertainty . in order to illustrate that this accuracy is insufficient for an exact determination of the deviations ,",
    "@xmath84 is plotted in for calculations with three values of @xmath2 , which differ by even less than @xmath85 .",
    "only data points with @xmath86 are shown , the data points for resonances with @xmath87 go along with them .",
    "the three calculations have a very different behavior in the semiclassical limit , but roughly agree for low frequencies . in a next step we considered the index of refraction",
    "@xmath2 as a fit parameter  let s call it @xmath88  in , where @xmath88 enters implicitly via @xmath0 , and varied it such that yields the measured resonance frequencies . if the @xmath0-model provides a good description , the resulting values of @xmath88 should scatter around the actual value of @xmath2 .",
    "the results are shown in .",
    "almost all data points ( except the ones at low frequencies ) lie inside the error band @xmath89 , but they form three distinct curves for the three values of the radial quantum number @xmath80 .",
    "this provides further evidence for the failure of the @xmath0-model : if the model were correct , the values of @xmath88 would form a single line along the actual index of refraction @xmath2 of the disk for both polarizations and all three values of @xmath80 .",
    "it is known from literature ( and was confirmed experimentally ) that teflon has negligible dispersion in this frequency range . in conclusion the observed deviations between the model and the experiment",
    "can not be attributed to a badly determined index of refraction , as it is impossible to achieve agreement between @xmath81 and @xmath82 in the whole frequency range by choosing a fixed value of @xmath2 .",
    "this is also true for the other two parameters , the radius @xmath49 and the thickness @xmath1 , or combinations thereof .",
    "thus we can exclude the possibility of badly determined parameters and inaccuracies in the measurement of the resonance frequencies and state our main result : the @xmath0-model does not correctly describe the measured resonance frequencies .",
    "finally , the measured and calculated resonance widths ( fwhm ) are compared .",
    "the experimental resonance widths @xmath90 are obtained by fitting lorentzians to the measured spectrum .",
    "they consist of three terms , @xmath91 where @xmath92 describes the losses due to radiation , @xmath93 the losses due to absorption in the teflon and @xmath94 the loss of power due to the coupling to the antennas .",
    "the calculated resonance widths @xmath95 include only the losses due to radiation ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "the measured and calculated widths of the tm - modes for disk a are shown in .",
    "for low frequencies ( up to @xmath96 ghz for @xmath86 and up to @xmath97 ghz for @xmath98 ) , the calculated widths are up to twice as large as the measured widths . since @xmath99 does not account for absorption and antenna losses ,",
    "the actual difference is even larger . for higher frequencies ,",
    "the measured widths are larger than the calculated ones and saturate at a value of about .",
    "this saturation is due to absorption in the teflon material and coupling to the antennas , and is approximately independent of the frequency .",
    "a precise comparison with the calculated widths is generally not possible because the radiation losses @xmath92 can not be extracted from the measured widths @xmath90 .",
    "nonetheless it can be stated that the widths @xmath99 predicted by the @xmath0-model are too large at least in some frequency ranges within the range of accuracy of the index of refraction @xmath2 .",
    "it should also be noted that @xmath99 does not depend as sensitively on @xmath2 as the resonance frequencies . for te - modes ,",
    "the same general trend for @xmath90 and @xmath99 is found , although the difference between @xmath90 and @xmath99 is not as pronounced as for the tm - modes .",
    "next , we will compare the data of the second , thinner disk b ( ) with the calculations based on the @xmath0-model .",
    "the discrepancy between experiment and model becomes apparent when comparing measured and calculated resonance frequencies in ( like in for disk a ) .",
    "the differences @xmath84 seem to be larger for disk b , but are of the same order of magnitude",
    ". however , in contrast to those for disk a , they increase with increasing excitation frequency .",
    "in fact , this behavior depends sensitively on @xmath2 ; changing the value of @xmath2 within the range of accuracy leads to differences increasing , decreasing or reaching a finite value with increasing @xmath81 ( see also ) . in any case",
    "the deviations are larger than for disk a at least for frequencies up to .",
    "like in , the index of refraction @xmath88 needed to reproduce the measured resonance frequencies with is shown for @xmath100 in with respect to the resonance frequency @xmath81 .",
    "qualitatively , the curves are similar to those in : @xmath88 grows with increasing frequency and seems to converge to some value depending on the polarization , and @xmath88 has a weak dependence on the radial quantum number @xmath80 of the modes .",
    "compared to the results for disk a shown in the deviation of @xmath88 from @xmath2 seems to be even larger for the thinner disk b , and those between the curves for different @xmath80 are more pronounced .",
    "again , the systematic failure of the @xmath0-model is clearly visible , and the discrepancies seem to be even larger .",
    "the comparison of calculated and measured resonance widths for disk b is plotted in . like in , the measured widths",
    "@xmath90 are significantly smaller than the calculated widths @xmath99 for the resonances with lower azimuthal quantum numbers , although the difference is not quite as large as for the case of disk a. with increasing frequency , the measured widths saturate at a value of about , and a comparison with the calculated widths is not possible because of the additional losses due to absorption and the antennas .",
    "the difference between @xmath90 and @xmath99 is smaller in the case of tm - modes , and gets smaller for both cases if a larger index of refraction @xmath2 is assumed in the calculations .",
    "still , it is definite that the calculated widths are too large at least for some resonances .",
    "we have measured the resonance frequencies and widths of two different flat cylindrical dielectric microwave resonators . the quantum numbers and the polarization of the corresponding modes were identified .",
    "these data were used to test the @xmath0-model , a two - dimensional approximation for flat dielectric resonators with large planar extension normally used for the modeling of e.g.  microlasers .",
    "a microwave resonator was chosen as testbed for several reasons : it is easy to handle due to its macroscopic dimensions which are known with high precision , the measurement of intensity distributions enables a detailed understanding of the spectrum and the identification of individual resonances , and it is a passive system which means that additional shifts of resonance frequencies and widths due to the lasing process in an active medium @xcite can be excluded .",
    "it was shown that the @xmath0-model fails to correctly predict the resonance frequencies in a systematic way , and it has been checked carefully that the deviations between experiment and calculations are not due experimental inaccuracies caused by e.g.  the antennas or the suspensions .",
    "also , the resonance widths are clearly overestimated at least in the lower frequency range .",
    "this is important because the widths ( of the passive cavity ) determine the lasing threshold in microlasers and play a crucial role with regard to mode - competition @xcite .",
    "although the calculations based on the @xmath0-model yield at least the correct order of magnitude for both resonance frequencies and widths , a detailed understanding of the spectrum with help of these calculations is impossible . furthermore , the accuracy of the model is not under control : the magnitude of the deviations between model and experiment can not be precisely determined due to the uncertainty in the index of refraction , and depends on the dimensions of the cavity and the frequency in a non - trivial way .",
    "it seems that deviations are larger for smaller values of @xmath35 , i.e.  thinner resonators .",
    "we believe that the main reason for the failure of the @xmath0-model is the incorrect formulation of the boundary conditions ( as in ) . in the rigorous treatment of the 3d maxwell equations the @xmath9-components of the electric and magnetic fields",
    "are connected by the boundary conditions and can not be considered separately as done in the @xmath0-model @xcite .",
    "the large deviations between model and experiment observed for the circular disk are not due to the localization of the ( whispering gallery ) modes close to the boundary , and not expected to be smaller if modes supported by the whole area of the disk were considered . in fact the modes with lower @xmath80 are localized closer to the boundary ( see ) , but the deviations are smaller than for modes with higher @xmath80 .",
    "even though the circular resonator is a special case and the test of the @xmath0-model with a non - circular geometry remains an open problem , it is still worthwhile to consider it : the quasi - bound states of many other non - circular resonators are also of whispering gallery mode type .",
    "moreover , the circular resonator has many important applications by itself @xcite .",
    "one of these is the precise measurement of the index of refraction over a wide range of frequencies which , however , relies on a rigorous model for the resonance frequencies . in summary",
    ", the comparison of the measured and computed resonance frequencies and widths clearly attests the need of an improved @xmath0-model , which takes into account the boundary conditions at the cylindrical sidewalls .",
    "we hope that this work will stimulate further research in this direction to obtain a reliable 2d model for the computation of the resonance frequencies and widths of flat dielectric resonators .",
    "although the numerical solution of the full three - dimensional maxwell s equations is feasible for the circular resonator @xcite , it is computationally demanding , and even more so for other ( viz .",
    "chaotic ) geometries .",
    "still , 3d numerical calculations for the circular resonator would be helpful to validate our data and investigate the accuracy of the @xmath0-model in a broader range of aspect ratios @xmath101 and indices of refraction @xmath2 .",
    "the authors are grateful to e. bogomolny for his original suggestion to investigate the validity of the @xmath0-model experimentally and to him and m. hentschel for many intense discussions .",
