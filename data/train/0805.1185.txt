    "in particular , in the second harmonic generation process , the fundamental field carrying a vortex with the charge @xmath2 is converted into the second harmonic field with the charge @xmath3 @xcite .",

    "multi - component vortex solitons sustained by the interaction of the beams with different frequencies in both quadratic and cubic materials are also well known , though under the most typical conditions the finite radius vortex solitons break into filaments due to azimuthal instabilities @xcite .",
    "while the above mentioned experimental and theoretical research of nonlinear vortex charge conversion has focused on cases involving a small number of frequency components , typically two or three , the efforts directed towards short pulse generation have resulted in the development of techniques leading to the generation of dozens of coherent frequency side - bands , by means of cascaded four - wave mixing in raman active gases @xcite .",
