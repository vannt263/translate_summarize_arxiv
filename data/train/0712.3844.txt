    "the anderson localization of light has been one of the most fascinating phenomena in condensed matter physics since the mid - eighties @xcite . like electron systems this phenomenon finds its origin in coherent multiple scattering which slows down diffusion of photons and eventually brings them to stop .",
    "parallel to studies of disordered conductors the subject in this field ranges from light localization near or far below the mobility edge in bulk ( infinite ) systems @xcite ( where low - energy photon motion enjoys the translational symmetry ) to their detection such as transmission measurements in the slab geometry ( e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "a unique subject of localization in optical ( and other classical wave ) systems is the enhanced coherent backscattering ( cbs ) phenomenon @xcite . in this subject",
    "the issue of semi - infinite geometry is heavily addressed because the cbs line shape is responsible for by optical paths near the vacuum - medium interface .",
    "although it is well known that in the weak disorder region , i.e. , @xmath0 ( @xmath1 the mean free path and @xmath2 the wavelength ) incident photons enjoy diffusion as in bulk media @xcite , in the strong disorder region @xmath3 the role played by the leakage at the interface has been of long term interests @xcite and , still , remains in the central position of cbs studies , particularly to forecast or observe the cbs line shape @xcite .",
    "pressingly , in the latter region strong localization emerges in the bulk and a new scale namely the localization length @xmath4 appears . on the experimental side ,",
    "there has been increasing evidence indicating that inside the boundary layer of thickness @xmath5 the photon leakage at the vacuum - medium interface strongly interplays with strong localization @xcite . on the theoretical side ,",
    "some time ago exact solution of semi - infinite one - dimensional disordered chains shed the light on the existence of so - called radiative localization states in the boundary layer @xcite , which lead to anomalous slowing decay of reflected ( backscattered ) incident light pulses @xcite .",
    "recently , in an insightful theoretical work @xcite it was realized that ( in three - dimensional disordered media ) inside the boundary layer the translational symmetry of low - energy ( hydrodynamic ) photon motion is strongly destroyed resulting in the so - called `` local diffusion '' .",
    "remarkably , constructive wave interference renders the static diffusion coefficient depending on the distance from the interface .",
    "consequently , the local diffusion was found to lead to a rounded cbs line shape resembling that observed experimentally @xcite and , thus , might overcome the conceptual difficulty of earlier theoretical proposal @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the dynamic generalization of the local diffusion equation @xcite provides an explanation of some key phenomena observed in quasi - one - dimensional microwave experiment @xcite , and well captures anomalous slowing decay of reflected incident pluses in both quasi - one - dimensional @xcite and three - dimensional disordered media @xcite .",
    "moreover , such novel prediction  the position dependence of diffusion coefficient  seems to have been confirmed by a very recent experiment @xcite .    despite of these progress theoretical investigations on local diffusion are , however , restricted on the self - consistent diagrammatical method @xcite .",
    "thus , an intellectual challenge is to seek for the genuine microscopic origin underlying this novel concept .",
    "this is , indeed , the purpose of this work . the last few decades have witnessed spectacular success of applications of supersymmetric field theory to various disordered systems in the absence of interactions ( such condition is perfectly satisfied by optical systems . ) @xcite . among them there are few exact nonperturbative results for quasi - one - dimensional disordered wires such as density - density correlation function ( in the infinite geometry ) @xcite and transmission statistics @xcite .",
    "they allow one to make important insight on the strong localization .",
    "most importantly , for periodic disordered media by using the supersymmetric field - theoretic method a local light diffusion equation , similar to that proposed in ref .",
    ", recently has been derived at the microscopic level @xcite . in view of these",
    "it is natural and inevitably necessary to proceed along the same line to explore the concept of local light diffusion and its effects for more general  fully disordered  media , which differ drastically from the former @xcite from both physical and technical view .",
    "the main results of this paper are as follows .",
    "( i ) we present a field - theoretic proof showing that , in contrary to the conjecture of ref .",
    ", no scaling behavior exists inside a layer of thickness @xmath6 extrapolating into the vacuum .",
    "( ii ) we justify  at the perturbative level  the local diffusion equation proposed in refs .  .",
    "( iii ) we analyze signatures of the static local diffusion in the cbs line shape .",
    "it should be stressed that in this paper the suspersymmetric field theory is treated perturbatively , and the nonperturbative treatise will be reported in the forthcoming paper .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we produce nonlinear supersymmetric @xmath7 model in the context of optical systems .",
    "most importantly , we derive the boundary constraint satisfied by the supersymmetric matrix field .",
    "the supersymmetric field theory is then applied to the two - dimensional medium bar .",
