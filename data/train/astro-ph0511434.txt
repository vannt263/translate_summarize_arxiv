    "studies of molecular gas in the host galaxies of qsos and high rank seyfert 1 galaxies are essential for the understanding of the star formation in and fueling of the central engines .",
    "especially the nearby qsos ( z@xmath20.1 ) represent an important link between the cosmologically local agn and the high redshift , high luminosity qsos ( z@xmath30.5 ) .",
    "observations of galaxies hosting agn remain challenging , even with state - of - the - art instrumentation .",
    "studies of this kind require exceptionally high spatial resolutions and sensitivities to be able to separate the nuclear component from the faint contribution of the underlying galaxy . but",
    "even with the highest resolutions feasible , a detailed analysis of the distribution and kinematics of the molecular gas component is possible only for the closest objects .",

    "the sources in our sample were selected from the hamburg / eso survey ( he s ) for bright qsos and the vron - cetty and vron quasar catalogue . unlike preceding surveys ,",
    "he s does not discriminate against extended sources , thus enabling the study of host galaxies .",
    "the only selection criterion for the nearby qso sample was the cosmological distance : only objects with a redshift z@xmath40.060 were chosen .",
    "this redshift limit ensures the observability of the important diagnostic co(2 - 0 ) rotation vibrational band head absorption line , which is then still accessible in the k - band ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "the sample consists of 63 sources .",
    "it is entirely based on a volume limit and not based on a fir flux selection criterion .",
    "we scanned 39 members of the nearby qso sample for millimetric co emission so far .",
    "the primary goal was to identify the co brightest objects for high resolution interferometric followup observations .",
    "these initial measurements were carried out in part with the bima array , in part with the sest 15 m single - dish telescope and resulted in 5 detections .",
    "another 6 sources show marginal detections on the 2s level and deserve closer investigation in the near future .",
    "table [ tabsestresults ] lists the integrated temperatures , derived co luminosities and molecular gas mass estimates for all objects observed with sest .",
    "the co luminosities were determined , using @xmath5 @xcite , where @xmath6 is the telescope beam ( 45  ) .",
    "the luminosity distance d@xmath7 was calculated assuming h@xmath8=75 km s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 and q@xmath8=0.5 .",

    "the medium spatial resolution of 13.6  @xmath13 5.8  that was achieved in this antenna array configuration did not allow to resolve the source .",
    "this was achieved by follow - up pdbi observations in b and c configuration in feb .",

    "these observations revealed a strong association of the detected co(1 - 0 ) and co(2 - 1 ) line emission with the optical bar . in the position - velocity diagrams a strong velocity gradient across the bar indicates a bar - driven inflow of gas",
    "the co emission is consistent with a simple bar model .",
    "the co(2 - 1)/co(1 - 0 ) line ratio is estimated to be  0.7 , which indicates subthermally excited , cold gas typically found in a disk .",
