    "this paper is a sequel to an article @xcite , where we intensively studied twistor spaces on @xmath0 which could be considered as the most generic ones among all moishezon twistor spaces on @xmath0 .",
    "the most characteristic property of these twistor spaces is that they have a natural structure of double covering over a very simple rational threefold , so called a scroll of planes over a conic .",
    "moreover , the branch divisor of the covering is always a cut of the scroll by a _",
    "quartic hypersurface .",
    "_ this allowed us to describe each of these twistor spaces by a single quartic polynomial .",
    "it was shown that this quartic polynomial takes not general but a very special form .",
    "this description has a clear advantage when describing a global structure of the moduli space of these twistor spaces .    while these twistor spaces are most generic among all moishezon twistor spaces on @xmath0 as above , we showed in another article @xcite ( in which we classified all moishezon twistor spaces on @xmath0 ) that there still exist other three families of twistor spaces on @xmath0 which have a natural structure of a double covering over the same scroll .",
    "the twistor spaces in these families are strictly different from the ones in @xcite , but they are obtained from the generic ones by taking a limit under deformations . in particular , the branch divisor of the double covering is still a cut of the scroll by a quartic hypersurface , while its defining equation should be subject to stronger constraint .    among the three families , the most special one is nothing but the family of twistor spaces studied in @xcite ( specialized to the case of @xmath0 ) . in particular for twistor spaces in this family",
    "the defining equation of the quartic hypersurface is already determined .",
    "the main purpose of this article is to obtain the equation of the quartic hypersurface for the remaining two families of the spaces    as explained above , twistor spaces whose anticanonical map is of degree two can be classified into four types .",
    "distinction of the types can be detected by the number of irreducible components of the base curve for the half - anticanonical system on the twistor spaces .",
    "we just call these as type i , ii , iii and iv ( definition [ def : type ] ; this naming is justified when we obtain defining equation of the quartic hypersurface . ) .",
    "type i is most generic ( so they are studied in @xcite ) and type iv is most special ( so they are studied in @xcite ) .",
    "hence in this paper we study those of type ii and type iii . in section [ s : acs ]",
    "we take a general member of the half - anticanonical system and investigate structure of its bi - anticanonical system .",
    "the last system exhibits the surface as a double covering of @xmath1 with branch being a quartic curve , whose singularities depend on the types i  iv ( as displayed in figure [ fig : quartics ] ) .    as above",
    ", the structure of the twistor spaces can be captured through the anticanonical system . in section 3",
    ", we find _ reducible _ anti - canonical divisor(s ) of the twistor space , which will be a key for determining the equation of the branch divisor of the anticanonical map .",
    "in contrast with the generic ones studied in @xcite , the base locus of the anticanonical map of the present twistor spaces is quite complicated . in section 4",
    "we give a full elimination of this locus through explicit blowups .",
    "in particular , we find that the anticanonical map contracts some divisors to curves .",
    "( for the case of type i such a divisor does not exist as investigated in @xcite . )",
    "this information will give a strong constraint for the equation of the branch divisor of the anticanonical map .    in section 5 , by using the reducible anticanonical divisor(s )",
    "found in section 3 , we first find five special hyperplanes in @xmath2 whose intersection with the scroll touches the branch divisor along a curve .",
    "these curves are called double curves .",
    "next we show that there exists a hyperquadric in @xmath2 which contains all these five double curves . finally by using the hyperquadric and also the information about the anticanonical map obtained in section [ s : analysis ] , we determine defining equation of the branch divisor of the anticanonical map , for both cases of type ii and type iii ( theorem [ thm : main ] ) .",
    "the argument in the proof is mostly algebraic .",
    "we also give an account about how the defining equation of the quartic hypersurface degenerates when the twistor space changes the type .    in section 6",
    "we compute dimension of the moduli spaces of these twistor spaces .",
    "the conclusion including the cases of type i and type iv is as follows :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     note that the number of the double conics is always equal to the number of the reducible members of the pencil @xmath3 .",
    "next we investigate hyperquadrics in @xmath2 containing all these five double curves .",
    "[ prop : q ] as before let @xmath4 be of type ii or type iii , @xmath5 the branch divisor of the anticanonical map , and @xmath6 , the double curves on @xmath7 .",
    "then there exists a hyperquadric in @xmath2 which contains all these double curves and which is different from the scroll @xmath8 .    for the case of type ii",
    ", we consider quadratic hypersurfaces in @xmath2 which go through all the following 12 points :    1 .",
    "@xmath9 ( consisting of 2 points ) , 2 .",
    "@xmath10 ( consisting of 4 points ) , 3 .",
    "@xmath11 , and one of the two points @xmath12 ( consisting of 3 points ) , 4 .",
    "@xmath13 ( consisting of 2 points ) , 5 .",
    "one of the 2 points @xmath14 ( consisting of 1 point ) .",
    "we show that if a hyperquadric @xmath15 goes through these 12 points , then @xmath15 automatically contains all the five double curves .",
    "in fact , from ( a)(c ) , @xmath15 contains 5 points on @xmath16 , and hence @xmath17 .",
    "if @xmath15 further goes through the two points in ( d ) , @xmath15 passes through 8 points on @xmath18 , which means @xmath19 .",
    "furthermore from the final point ( e ) , @xmath15 goes through 5 points on @xmath20 , which means @xmath21 .",
    "this implies that @xmath15 passes through 8 points on @xmath22 , and therefore @xmath23 .",
    "these mean that @xmath15 contains 6 points on @xmath24 , meaning @xmath25 .",
    "thus the hyperquadric @xmath15 contains all the five double curves . since @xmath26",
    ", these hyperquadrics form a @xmath27-dimensional subsystem .",
    "any one of these @xmath15-s which is different from @xmath8 gives the required quadratic hypersurface .",
    "the case of type iii can be shown in a similar way .",
    "we omit the detail .",
    "we are ready for determining defining equation of the branch divisor of the anticanonical map . as before let @xmath29 be a linear projection , @xmath30 a conic in the target plane , and @xmath31 the scroll over @xmath30 .",
    "we know @xmath8 is the image of the anticanonical map of the twistor spaces .",
    "we fix any homogeneous coordinates @xmath32 on the above plane such that the conic @xmath30 is defined by the equation @xmath33 .",
    "[ thm : main ] let @xmath4 be a moishezon twistor space on @xmath0 whose anticanonical map is ( rationally ) of degree two over the image , and @xmath34 the anticanonical map .",
    "then the branch divisor of @xmath35 is an intersection of the scroll @xmath8 with a quartic hypersurface defined by the following equation :    1 .",
    "if @xmath4 is of type ii , the equation is of the form @xmath36 where @xmath15 is a quadratic polynomial such that the discriminant of the quadratic form @xmath37 is zero . 2 .",
    "if @xmath4 is of type iii , the equation of the hyperquartic is of the form @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a real number satisfying @xmath40 , and @xmath15 is a quadratic polynomial such that the discriminant of the quadratic form @xmath37 is zero .",
    "_ before proceeding to the proof , because of the coherency of the four types of the twistor spaces , we here write the equations of the branch divisors in the cases of type i and type iv . for the case of type i , under the above normalization for the equation of the conic @xmath30 , the equation of the hyperquartic is of the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath15 are linear and quadratic forms respectively .",
    "( no constraint for the discriminant of @xmath15 for this case . ) for the case of type iv , under the same normalization , the equation is of the form @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are distinct real numbers satisfying @xmath46 .",
    "further the discriminant of the quadratic form @xmath37 vanishes . _",
    "although these might look complicated , a general principle is simple : regardless of the types , the equation of the hyperquartic is always of the form @xmath47 and according to each of the degenerations i @xmath48 ii @xmath48 iii @xmath48 iv , one of the linear polynomial degenerates from those with 5 variables @xmath49 to those with 3 variables @xmath50 ; geometrically the hyperplanes ( in @xmath2 ) defined by the linear polynomials degenerate from general ones to those which contain the singular line @xmath51 of the scroll @xmath8 .",
    "so the ` absolute value ' of the type coincides with the number of the linear forms in the left - hand - side of which belong to @xmath52 $ ] .",
    "thus there is a strong similarity with the case of @xmath53 obtained by kreussler - kurke @xcite ( see also poon @xcite ) .",
    "_ proof of theorem [ thm : main ] .",
    "_ for an algebraic subset @xmath54 , we denote by @xmath55 $ ] the homogeneous ideal of @xmath56 . by proposition [ prop : branch ]",
    "there exists a hyperquartic @xmath57 in @xmath2 such that the branch divisor @xmath7 of the anticanonical map is given as @xmath58 .",
    "let @xmath59 be a defining quartic polynomial of @xmath57 , where @xmath60 are homogeneous coordinates on @xmath2 , chosen in such a way that the projection @xmath61 is given by @xmath62 . in particular we have @xmath63 .",

    "let @xmath15 be a defining polynomial of the hyperquadrics in @xmath2 containing all the double conics , whose existence was proved in proposition [ prop : q ] .",
    "let @xmath66 be the plane @xmath67 , where @xmath68 in the case of type ii and @xmath69 in the case of type iii .",

    "if @xmath74 for some @xmath75 , we obtain @xmath76 .",
    "further the last ideal is readily seen to be equal to @xmath77 , and therefore equals to @xmath78 $ ] .",
    "hence @xmath79 . but",
    "this means that the divisor @xmath80 contains @xmath51 , which contradicts the structure of the double conics ( including the splitting one ) obtained in section [ ss : dc ] .",
    "therefore @xmath81 for any double conics @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "next for the double quartic curve @xmath84 , so that @xmath85 in the case of type ii and @xmath86 for the case of type iii , since @xmath87 , there exists a constant @xmath88 such that @xmath89 .",
    "so taking a difference with @xmath90 , we obtain that @xmath91 .",
    "but since @xmath92 , we have @xmath93 , and therefore @xmath94 .",
    "hence if @xmath95 we have @xmath96 , which means @xmath97 .",
    "since @xmath98 , this means that the divisor @xmath99 contains a line @xmath100 on the plane @xmath101 as an irreducible component , which again contradicts the irreducibility of @xmath16 .",
    "therefore we have @xmath102 for any double quartic curve @xmath84 .",
    "by rescaling we can suppose @xmath103 for any @xmath104 .",
    "thus we have @xmath105    for the case of type iii , by using the last ideal , we can write @xmath106 , where @xmath42 is a cubic polynomial and @xmath107 is a quartic polynomial in @xmath108 .",
    "this readily means @xmath109 for any double conic @xmath82 ( namely for @xmath110 ) . for @xmath111 ,",
    "let @xmath112 be the line going through the two points @xmath113 and @xmath114 , and @xmath115 a defining linear polynomial of @xmath112 .",
    "then we have @xmath116 and therefore @xmath117 hence from @xmath118 we can write @xmath119 where @xmath120 is a defining quadratic polynomial of the scroll @xmath8 . if we write @xmath121 and @xmath122 in a way that @xmath123 and @xmath124 do not involve @xmath125 , then we compute @xmath126 as this equals @xmath127 and @xmath128 does not involve @xmath125 , we obtain @xmath129 . hence ,",
    "since @xmath120 and @xmath115 are mutually prime from irreducibility of the conic @xmath30 , we can write @xmath130 by some quadratic polynomial @xmath131 .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath132 repeating a similar argument we can pull out the linear polynomials @xmath133 and @xmath134 one by one , and it follows that @xmath135 can be written of the form @xmath136 , where @xmath137 .",
    "therefore we obtain @xmath138 by usual @xmath139-action we can normalize the homogeneous coordinates @xmath32 in such a way that @xmath140 hold",
    ". then we may suppose @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "moreover , as @xmath143 and all @xmath113-s are real and mutually distinct , @xmath134 must be of the form of the form @xmath144 , where @xmath145 .",
    "thus disposing @xmath146 , means that a defining equation of the hyperquartic @xmath57 can be taken in the form in theorem [ thm : main ] .",
    "for the case iii , we still remain to show the claim about discriminant of @xmath15 . as @xmath147 from the above choice of the coordinates , the image @xmath148 and @xmath148 and over the plane @xmath149 .",
    "further as in proposition [ prop : dsg84ga ] ( ii ) , these images are mutually distinct lines .",
    "hence @xmath37 must split into two linear forms , as claimed .    for the case of type ii , in the above argument for the case of type iii",
    ", we replace the role of the fourth double conic @xmath18 by the third one @xmath24 , and also the role of the remaining double conics @xmath82 @xmath150 by @xmath16 and @xmath20 .",
    "this gives a similar expression @xmath151 where @xmath115 @xmath152 is a defining equation of the line connecting the points @xmath153 and @xmath113 , @xmath42 is a linear polynomial in @xmath60 , and @xmath154 .",
    "further , from we have @xmath155 .",
    "hence we can write @xmath156 if we write @xmath157 where @xmath158 and @xmath159 is a linear polynomial without the variable @xmath125 , we obtain @xmath160 . therefore ,",
    "since @xmath161 does not involve @xmath125 , we have @xmath162 , and we obtain @xmath163 . by this",
    "means @xmath164 if @xmath165 , then @xmath166 , which means @xmath167 .",
    "this means that the branch divisor of the double covering @xmath168 is non - reduced .",
    "but of course this can not happen since the restriction of @xmath169 to a general fiber of @xmath170 is a non - reduced quartic curve ( proposition [ prop : bian1 ] ) .",
    "therefore we have @xmath171 , and we obtain @xmath172 with @xmath154 . then by the same argument in the case of type iii , we can normalize the homogeneous coordinates @xmath32 in a way that @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "this means that a defining equation of the hyperquartic @xmath57 can be taken in the form in theorem [ thm : main ] .",
    "the remaining claim about @xmath15 follows in exactly the same way as in the case of type iii , if we use lemma [ lemma : anti2 ] ( iii ) instead of proposition [ prop : dsg84ga ] ( ii ) . @xmath28",
    "in this section we compute dimension of the moduli space of the present twistor spaces . for the case of type i ,",
    "this was done in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5.1 ) , but the argument in the paper does not work in the cases of type ii and type iii .",
    "let @xmath4 be a twistor space on @xmath0 whose anticanonical map is of degree two , and suppose that the type of @xmath4 is i , ii or iii .",
    "( we include type i since the present argument reproves a result in @xcite . )",
    "let @xmath173 be a real irreducible member .",
    "then by a similar argument to ( * ? ? ?",

    "then by various standard exact sequences of sheaves including these , and noting @xmath180 , we obtain the following commutative diagram of cohomology groups on @xmath4 and @xmath178 : @xmath181 from the middle column of this diagram we obtain @xmath182 by and , which means @xmath183 from the middle row and . in particular",
    ", the kuranishi family of deformations of the pair @xmath184 is 14-dimensional .    in order to compute the dimension of the moduli spaces",
    ", we first recall that our twistor spaces ( of types i  iii ) can be characterized by the property that they have a rational surface @xmath178 with particular structure as a member of the system @xmath3 . for type ii twistor spaces the structure of @xmath178",
    "is described in the proof of proposition [ prop : reducible ] ( i ) in terms of blownup points of the birational morphism @xmath185 .",
    "in particular , all freedom for @xmath178 that can be contained in the twistor spaces of type ii is to move four points on a fixed cycle of anticanonical curve on @xmath186 ( the remaining four points does not contribute for deforming complex structure ) , and therefore they constitute 4-dimensional family of deformations of @xmath178 . via the kodaira - spencer map , this family determines a 4-dimensional subspace of @xmath187 , for which we denote by @xmath188 .",
    "we have @xmath189 .",
    "the tangent space of the moduli space of twistor spaces of type ii can be considered as the space @xmath190 .",
    "the image of the map @xmath191 in the diagram corresponds to deformations of @xmath184 that can be obtained by moving @xmath178 in @xmath4 , and of course they do not give a non - trivial deformation of @xmath4 .",
    "but from the characterization of @xmath4 by the complex structure of @xmath178 , even if we move @xmath178 in @xmath4 , its complex structure can not go away from the above 4-dimensional family of @xmath178 .",
    "this means that the image of @xmath191 is contained in @xmath192 .",
    "thus the tangent space of the moduli space of twistor spaces of type ii can be identified with the quotient space @xmath193 and this is 7-dimensional by .    for the case of type iii ,",
    "the same argument works except that the subspace @xmath194 becomes 2-dimensional in this case .",
    "consequently the tangent space of the moduli space is again identified with the quotient space , which is 5-dimensional this time . this way",
    "we conclude that the moduli space of twistor spaces is 7-dimensional for the case of type ii , and @xmath195-dimensional for the case of type iii .",
    "we note that as obtained in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5.1 ) , for the case of type i the moduli space is @xmath196-dimensional .",
    "this can also be seen from the above argument if we notice @xmath197 for the case of type i. thus according to the degenerations i @xmath48 ii and ii @xmath48 iii , the dimension of the moduli spaces drops by two . on the other hand for the case of type",
    "iv the moduli space is @xmath198-dimensional as obtained in @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy comes from the fact that twistor spaces of type iv admit a non - trivial @xmath199-action , while other three types of spaces do not .",
