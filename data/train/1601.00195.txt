    "deep mm / submm surveys that employ single - dish telescopes with detector arrays have revolutionized observational cosmology by uncovering a new population of submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ) ; these are dusty , extreme star - forming populations in the early universe ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* casey et al .  2014 ) ) .",
    "recent extensive follow up studies on smgs using alma have provided new insights into the nature of these extreme sources , such as their redshift distributions , multiplicity ( revising their number counts ) , and source sizes ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* karim et al.(2013 ) ) for apex / laboca sources in ecdf - s , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* simpson et al.(2015 ) ) for jcmt / scuba2 sources in uds , and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ikarashi et al.(2015 ) ) for aste / aztec sources in sxdf ) .",
    "however , despite their enormous ir luminosities ( @xmath11 ) , the contribution of smgs to the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) , which represents the integrated unresolved emission from extragalactic sources and contains vital information on the history of galaxy formation , is rather small ( e.g. , @xmath1210  20 % at 1.1 mm ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* scott et al .  2012 ) ) .",
    "in fact , recent alma observations suggest that _ faint smgs _ or _ sub - mjy sources _ , i.e. , mm - selected sources with @xmath13 1 mjy , may account for @xmath14 of the ebl at 1.1 to 1.3 mm bands ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ? * hatsukade et al .",

    "* oteo et al .  2015 ) ) .",
    "however , little is known about the physical properties , such as their redshift distribution and stellar masses , of these newly discovered sources .",
    "this is partly because sub - mjy galaxies are often faint in nir / radio at the currently achievable sensitivities .    here",
    ", we present an overview of the alma 1.1 mm ( band 6 ) imaging survey of sub - mjy galaxies in a contiguous @xmath0 ( 1.5 arcmin@xmath1 ) rectangular window , where deep multiwavelength data sets are available from sxdf , uds , candels , hugs , spuds , seds , and so on ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* galametz et al .  2013 ) for a summary of the ancillary data ) .",
    "the observed region was selected because of the richness of h@xmath15 emitting galaxies at @xmath16 uncovered by extensive narrow - band filter imaging surveys using moircs camera on the subaru telescope ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* tadaki et al .  2013 ) ) and covered by a 19-point mosaic in order to minimize the number of pointing , at a cost to the sensitivity uniformity within the mosaic map .",
    "this strategy minimizes the overhead fraction within the total observation time , since the overhead for the mosaic observations was expected to be rather large when the cycle 1 call for proposals was issued .",
    "the observations were carried out on 17 and 18 july 2014 under excellent atmospheric conditions , with a precipitable water vapor of 0.42 - 0.55 mm .",
    "total observation time was 3.6 hours . during the observations , 30 - 32 antennas were available and the range of baseline lengths was between 20 m and 650 m , providing an excellent _ uv _ coverage despite the source declination ( close to the equator ) .",
    "the continuum map was processed using clean with natural weighting , using casa package , which provides a synthesized beamsize of @xmath17 .",
    "the typical noise level is 0.055 mjy beam@xmath18 ( 1@xmath2 ) near the center of each pointing .",
    "the obtained alma image is shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "we also constructed a 3d cube with a frequency width of 60 mhz in order to search for any mm - wave line emitters using a clump - find algorithm .",
    "emitters at @xmath19 is indicated by small magenta circles .",

    "( middle ) a magnified view of the alma image showing two bright sources ( corresponding to sxdf - alma1 and 2 in table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "( right ) a 3-color composite nir image of the same region .",
    "there are 3 h@xmath15 emitters , 3 mips sources ( two of these are overlapped ) , and 1 star - forming galaxy at @xmath21 .",
    "we note a variety of 1.1 mm properties among these galaxies.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]",
    "we extract significant sources above 4@xmath2 using the aips task sad .",
    "we detected 23 sources in total , including 5 brightest sources ( s / n@xmath76 ) and 18 less significance sources ( 5@xmath7s / n@xmath74 ) .",
    "a part of the extracted sources ( with s / n larger than 4.4 ) are listed in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "we estimated false detection rates by counting negative peaks in the map , indicating that sources below 5@xmath2 may contain spurious detections , although the derived number counts are consistent with existing studies after careful estimations of completeness and false detection rate ( hatsukade et al . in prep . ) utilizing a source finding code aegean ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hancock et al .  2012 ) ) .",
    "the multiwavelength properties of the 5 brightest alma sources have been studied by exploiting the rich data in this field ( yamaguchi et al . in prep . ) , revealing that 4 of the alma sources are situated on the main sequence of star - forming galaxies with a significant stellar mass ( @xmath22 ) at their epochs ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "then does alma only detect dust emission from `` already known galaxies '' that were selected using rest - frame uv / optical deep surveys ?",
    "the answer is no ; one of the 5 brightest alma detections , sxdf - alma3 , is extremely faint even in the ultra - deep nir images from candels and hugs , as shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "further contributions to the star formation history may come from these faint submm galaxies that do not appear to be fully overlapped with uv / optical - selected galaxies ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chen et al .  2014 ) ) .",
    "another new type of alma sources is the mm - wave line - emitting galaxy ; we find a promising candidate for a line - emitting galaxy at an observing frequency of @xmath12273.3 ghz with a peak flux of @xmath25 mjy ( 5.4@xmath2 ) or a velocity - integrated line flux of @xmath26 jy km s@xmath18 ( 6.7@xmath2 ) that exhibits a galaxy - like line width ( fwhm @xmath12100 km s@xmath18 ) .",
    "although it is not yet clear at this stage whether this is a [ cii ] emitter at @xmath9 or a low-@xmath10 co emitting galaxy , this result encourages us to search for such mm - wave line emitters using the alma data . this may allow us to constrain [ cii ] and/or co luminosity functions across the history of the universe ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",

    "this is a `` spire - drop '' source . ]",
    "we find a rapid increase in the number of faint alma sources below @xmath120.3 mjy as expected by the latest source counts around 1 mm , demonstrating that undertaking a shallower survey by a factor of @xmath122 would drastically reduce the detections ( only 3 sources above 4@xmath2 ) .",
