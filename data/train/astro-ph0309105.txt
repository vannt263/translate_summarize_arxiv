    "observations of representative fields at high galactic latitude have long been an important tool in our quest to understand the distant universe . the hubble deep field project ( williams et al .",
    "1996 ; 2000 ) demonstrated the value of deep , multicolor _ hst _  imaging for studies of galaxy evolution , and the extraordinary multiplier of this value gained by rapid public dissemination of the data and coordination of the best observations at all wavelengths on common survey fields ( see ferguson , dickinson & williams 2000 for a review ) .",
    "the great observatories origins deep survey is the next generation of such deep surveys , uniting some of the deepest observations from space and ground - based facilities on common areas of the sky .",
    "the two goods fields , the hubble deep field north ( hdf - n ) and the chandra deep field south ( cdf - s ) , are the most data - rich deep survey areas on the sky . the deepest x ",
    "ray observations from the _ cxo _  and _ xmm  newton _ telescopes have been obtained at these locations , and deep radio maps are available or are now being collected .",
    "observations with _",
    "sirtf _ were selected as one of the legacy projects to be executed during the first year of the mission .",
    "the _ sirtf _",
    "legacy project includes major commitments of observing time from the national optical astronomical observatories ( noao ) and from the european southern observatory to provide spectroscopy ( redshifts ) for sources in the fields to the practical limits of existing instruments and to provide complementary imaging at near ultraviolet ( @xmath0band ) and near infrared wavelengths .",
    "the goods project was subsequently awarded 398 orbits of time to observe the two fields with _",
    "hst _ and acs .",
    "the goods project has been designed from the outset as a resource for the entire astronomical community .",
    "data from the _ hst _ observations are available from the archive within a few days of the observations . reduced data , with successive degrees of refinement , are available within a few months of the observations .",
    "a similar strategy is followed for the eso observations , and will be followed for _",

    "the goods field centers ( j2000.0 ) are @xmath2 @xmath3 for the hdf - n , and @xmath4 @xmath5 for the cdf - s .",

    "data are all reduced and available , all of the _ hst _ data have been obtained and are available , including a best  effort version of the reduced data , while the recalibrated , mosaiced stacks of the acs images will be released at the end of august .",
    "much of the planned optical imaging data from kpno and eso have been obtained and are available .",
    "deep near - ir imaging campaigns with the eso very large telescope ( vlt ) isaac camera and the kpno flamingos camera are partially complete , but will require one or two more observing seasons for complete field coverage",
    ". reduced data from first season ( 2001 ) of isaac observing are available . the planned spectroscopic campaign from eso was begun in the fall of 2002 with focal reducer / low - dispersion spectrograph ( fors2 ) observations of preferrentially red objects .",
    "observations with the vimos spectrograph are planned for the 2003 - 2004 cdf - s observing season .",
    "the hdf - n already benefits from deep spectroscopic observations from cohen et al.2000 .",
    "several teams are carrying out spectroscopic observations of the hdf - n from the w.m .",
    "keck observatory in early 2003 , and public releases from a few of these teams are planned for the second half of this year .",
    "the goods acs observations were spaced in time to permit a search for type ia supernovae at redshifts @xmath7 , and a total of 43 supernovae have been detected in eight goods search epochs . in their letter ,",
    "riess et al .",
    "provide details of how the type ia candidates at @xmath8 are selected for followup observations from among these sources .",
    "the other accompanying letters papers in this issue present initial findings on galaxies and agn at moderate to very high redshifts from the analysis of the available goods data .",
    "a letter by somerville et al .",
    "presents computations of the expected `` cosmic variance '' for various source populations based on halo statistics in cold - dark matter models consistent with the wilkinson microwave anistropy probe ( wmap ) cosmological parameters ( spergel et al .",
    "the data set discussed here includes acs images , deep optical and near  infrared imaging from kpno and eso , and the _ cxo _  images . the main features of each data set are summarized in table 1 , while table 2 lists the sensitivity achieved in each wavelength band .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show the exposure maps of the three space  based data sets overlaid on top of each other to illustrate the extent of the area in common .",
    "figure 3 shows a schematic of the layout of the existing imaging coverage in the cdf  s .",
    "the goods / acs observations consist of imaging in the f435w , f606w , f775w and f850lp passbands , hereafter referred to as @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11  and @xmath12 . while the @xmath9band images were all acquired at the beginning of the survey , the @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12band images have been carried out in five epochs , separated by 40 to 50 days to optimize the search for high - redshift supernovae .",
    "only 60% of the total exposure time in each field ( 3 epochs out of 5 ) in the @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12are presented here , since the remainder of the data were not available at the time these papers were being prepared . in the odd",
    " numbered epochs each @xmath13 field is tiled by a grid of @xmath14 individual acs pointings , including some area of tile overlapping to check photometric and astrometric consistency . in even - numbered epochs , due to",
    "_ hst _ pointing constraints , the field is rotated by @xmath15 and a different overlapping tiling pattern is used , consisting of 16 separate pointings ( see figures 1 and 2 ) .",
    "the complete set of @xmath9  observations were obtained in the first epoch alone , using the @xmath14 grid , with six exposures per position .",
    "the exposure times at each epoch are typically 1050 , 1050 and 2100 seconds in the @xmath10 , @xmath11  and @xmath12  bands , respectively .",
    "these are subdivided into 2 exposures in each of the @xmath10  and @xmath11  bands , and into 4 exposures in the @xmath12band .",
    "this strategy ensures good rejection of cosmic ray events in the single ",
    "epoch @xmath12  bands , which is where the detection of transients is carried out .",
    "some cosmic rays remain in the @xmath10  and @xmath11  single ",
    "epoch images , which can nevertheless generally provide colors of the transients . in each case , the telescope field of view is shifted ( `` dithered '' ) by a small amount between individual exposures to allow optimal sampling of the point  spread function and to remove detector gaps and artifacts .",
    "the multiple epochs are later combined into a single mosaic , allowing cosmic ray rejection from at least six images per band . except for the @xmath9  band ,",
    "the mosaics used for the current papers were constructed from only three epochs of observations , and the total exposure times are approximately 7200 , 3040 , 3040 , and 6280 seconds in the @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12  bands , respectively .",
    "basic reduction of the raw data is carried out through calacs , the acs calibration pipeline , which applies the basic calibration steps of bias subtraction , gain correction , and flat - fielding ( pavlovsky et al .",
    "the data received from the _ hst _ pipeline are then further processed by the goods pipeline using the multidrizzle script ( koekemoer et al .",
    "2003 ) , to create a set of geometrically rectified , cosmic - ray cleaned images ( within a given epoch ) .",
    "these processed `` tiles '' are released as the `` best - effort '' goods public release v0.5 via the multimission archive at space telescope ( mast ) .    the early version of the geometric distortion model used in the basic processing described above proved to have significant problems matching sources in overlapping tiles .",
    "to rectify this , we derived an astrometric solution for each tile and each epoch based on sources matched in goods groundbased images .",
    "the reference for the cdf - s image was the @xmath16band image of the field obtained as part of the eso imaging survey ( eis ) with the wide field imager ( wfi ) , which in turn was astrometrically calibrated to the guide star catalog 2 ( gsc-2 ) and put on the icrs reference frame . for hdf ",
    "n , the reference image was an @xmath16-band subaru image of the field ( capak et al.2003 ) .",
    "the astrometric solution for the @xmath17-band mosaics has been derived by a least - squares optimization of the position , orientation , x and y pixel scales , and axis skew of each tile and epoch , minimizing the inter - epoch variations of the estimated position for @xmath18 sources .",
    "the estimated rms in the source position , internal to the solution , is about 0.1 to 0.2 wfc pixels . for the other acs bands ,",
    "the astrometric solution is based on a tile - by - tile match to @xmath17-band source positions .",
    "these solutions had a residual rms of about 0.3 pixels , with larger deviations in some local regions across the field .",
    "all the exposures were then drizzled ( fruchter & hook 2002 ) onto a series of images with a common pixel grid , in order to create a clean median image , which was subsequently used to create a cosmic ray mask for each exposure . finally , the individual exposures were drizzled , using the new masks , onto a final single mosaic for each band , measuring 18000 by 24000 pixels with a scale of 005/pixel .    for the purposes of the current papers the astrometric solution appears to be acceptable ,",
    "although its deficiencies become apparent for bright stars , where the cosmic ray rejection algorithm rejects some good pixels due to the slight misregistrations .",
    "this can bias fluxes ( faintward ) for the brighter point sources in the @xmath10 and @xmath11 images ( only ) .",
    "we have verified that there is little or no photometric effect for even slightly extended sources .",
    "a photometric comparison of the @xmath10  magnitudes ( sextractor ` mag_auto ` values ) in the original wfpc-2 hdf - n and the current mosaic reveals systematic biases of less than 0.01 magnitudes for galaxies in the range @xmath19@xmath10@xmath20 , with an rms scatter less than 0.2 mag .",
    "the resulting mosaics have a few remaining blemishes and some misregistrations between bands at the level of a fraction of a pixel .",
    "slight sky level variations are also apparent .",
    "the masking of satellite trails , and reflection ghosts is not yet perfect , with residuals apparent in few places .",
    "the samples of galaxies used for the papers in this volume have all been individually inspected to remove objects that are thought to be artifacts . for most samples",
    "such contamination is negligible , but the contamination is significant for the single - band detections used to search for galaxies at @xmath21 , as discussed in detail by dickinson et al .",

    "the goods _ sirtf _ field layout was designed in part to maximize the coverage of the x  ray area .",
    "subsequently , the acs fields were designed to optimally cover both the _ sirtf _ and _ chandra _ fields .",
    "the _ cxo _",
    "data for both fields have been re  analyzed in a self  consistent way , and new catalogs have been published by alexander et al .",

    ". the sensitivities at the _ cxo _  aim point , where the exposure time and image quality are maximized , are as much as a factor of @xmath29 and @xmath30 fainter for the cdf - s and hdf - n , respectively .",
    "ground  based imaging spanning a wide wavelength baseline is an important component of goods , and here , we describe the data that have been used for projects presented in this special issue . the cdf  s imaging consists of a complex arrangement of data sets covering different areas , often using multiple instrument pointings , as illustrated in figure  3 .",
    "these data sets were all placed on a common astrometric grid tied to the gsc2 .",
    "the psfs were matched by gaussian convolution to a common fwhm of 09 .",
    "the wfi @xmath31 images and a few of the images obtained with the new technology telescope ( ntt ) and the superb  seeing imager ( sofi ) have slightly poorer seeing , 09105 , but most projects use colors measured through @xmath32 apertures , so this small mismatch should have little effect . the psf ",

    "the sensitivity of the images depends on the sizes and shapes of the objects of interest . to guide the readers of these letters ,",
    "table 2 provides two sensitivity estimates ( point source flux and limiting surface brightness ) for each of the goods space and ground  based imaging data sets .",
    "these should be taken as representative values only , since the actual depths of the imaging data sets vary over the field of view , and depend on the details of source size , psf shape , crowding , etc .",

    "we have iteratively inserted sources into the image and re - run sextractor .",
    "this is the standard procedure used for point - source photometry to assess completeness and photometric errors in color - magnitude diagrams .",
    "the problem has more dimensions for galaxy photometry because the detectability of a galaxy depends on the size and surface brightness profile .",
    "our simulations uniformly populate the magnitude range @xmath54 and the range of galaxy half - light radii @xmath55 .",

    "the simulated galaxies are convolved with the psf and inserted into the @xmath17-band image without additional poisson noise . for bright sources ,",
    "the noise is thus slightly underestimated , but for faint sources , the sky background completely dominates anyway so this shortcut does not affect the results .",
    "the resulting completeness limits in a plane of magnitude and half - light radius are shown in fig .",

    "<S> this special issue of the astrophysical journal letters is dedicated to presenting initial results from the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ) that are primarily , but not exclusively , based on multi  band imaging data obtained with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) and the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) . </S>",
    "<S> the survey covers roughly 320 square arcminutes in the acs f435w , f606w , f814w , and f850lp bands , divided into two well - studied fields . existing deep observations from the _ chandra _ </S>",
    "<S> x - ray observatory ( _ cxo _ ) and ground - based facilities are supplemented with new , deep imaging in the optical and near - infrared from the european southern observatory ( eso ) and from the kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) . </S>",
    "<S> deep observations with the _ space infrared telescope facility _ ( sirtf ) are scheduled . </S>",
    "<S> reduced data from all facilities are being released worldwide within three to six months of acquisition . together , this data set provides two deep reference fields for studies of distant normal and active galaxies , supernovae , and faint stars in our own galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> this paper serves to outline the survey strategy and describe the specific data that have been used in the accompanying letters , summarizing the reduction procedures and sensitivity limits .    </S>",
