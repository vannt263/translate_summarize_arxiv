    "since their discovery by s. iijima and t. ichihashi @xcite in 1993 , single - walled carbon nanotubes ( swnts ) have attracted attention due to their remarkable electronic and mechanical properties @xcite . at low energies , they represent an almost perfect realization of a one - dimensional ( 1d ) system of interacting electrons with an additional orbital degree of freedom due to the sublattice structure of graphene .",
    "accounting for spin and orbital degrees of freedom implies that for nanotubes a shell structure is expected , where each shell can accommodate up to four electrons . in the absence of coulomb interaction",

    "these short - ranged interactions cause in finite size nanotubes exchange effects leading for a tube filling of @xmath0 to a groundstate with either total spin @xmath1 or @xmath2 ( a triplet)@xcite .",
    "signatures of the exchange interactions have indeed been inferred from stability diagrams of carbon - nanotube - based quantum dots @xcite . in particular",

    "finally , the lines on the right edges of the plots are mirror images and belong to backward transitions from @xmath94 to @xmath86 ; for this reason they mark a decrease of current for both polarized and unpolarized leads .",
    "in summary , we have calculated spin dependent transport through fully interacting swnts in both the linear and the nonlinear regime , with and without an applied magnetic field .",
    "peculiar of metallic swnts of small diameter is the possibility , due to exchange interactions , to find the system at @xmath0 filling either in a groundstate of total spin @xmath1 or @xmath213 . which of the two groundstates occurs in a real nanotube depends on the relation between the exchange energy and the orbital band mismatch .",

    "for example in the linear regime the conductance for parallel lead magnetization and finite magnetic field increases by raising the polarization for the case of a triplet groundstate but it decreases for the @xmath1 groundstate .",
    "this is due to the fact that for the triplet groundstate transport is dominated by a channel involving the triplet state @xmath151 ( with both spins @xmath101 ) ; for the @xmath1 case transport to be mediated by the majority electrons requires to make use of the @xmath76 lowest excited state @xmath150 ( and hence less favorable ) , zeeman split from the ground state .    in the nonlinear regime we presented stability diagrams with parallel and antiparallel lead magnetization for both ground sates . in the antiparallel case it was possible to observe a negative differential conductance ( ndc ) effect for the @xmath1 groundstate , following immediately upon a conductance enhancement at the opening of a trapping channel to the excited triplet state @xmath132 . directly at that resonance ,",
    "electrons can , just by thermal activation , tunnel back _ and _ fourth , such that trapping in the @xmath132 state can not yet act , leading to an intermediate conductance increase . away from resonance ,",
    "the blocking effect fully occurs , resulting in the ndc . by adding an external magnetic field in the parallel setup we found ndc effects for both groundstates caused by spin blocking mediated by @xmath115 - channels , involving in particular the triplet state @xmath132 .",
    "finally , we also presented results for the differential conductance in a gate - voltage and magnetic field map at finite bias .",
    "these magnetic field sweeps immediately allow to recognize the nature of the @xmath0-filling groundstate at zero field , as well as to tune the nature of the groundstate from @xmath1 to @xmath215 upon variation in the field amplitude .",
    "our results for unpolarized leads are in _ quantitative _ agreement with experiments on a small - diameter swnt by moryama et al .",
    "importantly the sweep at zero field also allows to immediately read off the values of the short range interactions @xmath168 and @xmath65 .",
    "specifically , @xmath168 is the singlet - triplet exchange splitting and @xmath65 characterizes at zero orbital mismatch the energy difference between two of the low energy states of total spin @xmath1 . in the presence of polarized leads the magnetic field sweep also reveals lines of ndc due to the trapping nature of all @xmath115 - channels .",
