    "in the study of a quantum field theory ( qft ) , the one - point functions play a fundamental _ rle _ ; indeed , when using the operator product expansion ( ope ) to calculate the ultraviolet asymptotics of a correlation function , one needs to know both the coefficients of the said expansion and the one - point functions of the local operators in the theory .",
    "while the former are purely ultra - violet objects and can , in principle , be extracted via perturbation theory of the corresponding ultra - violet conformal field theory ( cft ) , the one - point functions depend essentially on the infra - red structure of the theory , where perturbative techniques are of no help at all .",
    "thus the development of new methods to explore the infra - red region is of primary importance .",
    "integrable models are the perfect playground where one can experiment with new analytical methods aimed at extracting data ; in particular the sinh - gordon model is the simplest example of massive integrable qft and , at the same time , is complicated enough to display interesting structures . moreover this model , along with its twin , the sine - gordon model , has received plenty of attention in the last 30 years and nowadays most of its features are known .",
    "computing one - point functions in an integrable deformation of a cft is anything but an easy task and we wish to explain the reasons for this fact clearly .",
    "although in our deformed theory the conformal invariance is broken , the local fields retain a one - to - one correspondence with those of the original cft , which are organized according to the corresponding virasoro algebra in the usual way .",
    "this means that in the perturbed theory there exist fields @xmath0 which can be deemed as _ primary _",
    ", whose space of descendants can be identified with the tensor product of verma modules @xmath1 of the unperturbed cft .",
    "the operators acting in the space of states of the perturbed cft can thus be interpreted as operators acting on the corresponding verma modules and , consequently , one - point functions appear to be functionals on the tensor product @xmath1 .",
    "however , we still have not taken in account the integrable structure of the model ; in fact _ all one - point functions of descendants built out of integrals of motion identically vanish_. this means that the correct space on which the one - point function should be defined as a linear functional is the tensor product @xmath2 of the two quotient spaces    @xmath3    where with @xmath4 ( respectively @xmath5 ) we denote the action of the chiral ( antichiral ) integrals of motion on the verma module .",
    "it s now becoming clear what is the main issue : the basis we introduced above , composed of the primary fields @xmath6 and their  conformal \" descendants , is a basis for the full verma module ! in order to reduce this last to a basis of the quotient space , one has to factor out by hand all the null vectors which arise from the action of the integrals of motion and their form quickly becomes rather involved .",
    "one would rather work directly in the quotient space , where the factoring of null vectors is automatically taken in account , and fix uniquely a basis by means of some physical requirement .",
    "a basis of this kind was actually discovered some years ago for the six - vertex model @xcite and immediately extended to cft @xcite , sine - gordon @xcite and sinh - gordon models @xcite .",
    "the building blocks of this basis are the primary fields @xmath6 and creation operators which , acting on the former , produce the descendants , much like what happens for the usual conformal basis ; the peculiar fact is that these creation operators are _",
    "fermions_. there are two of them for each chirality : @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 . in the above - cited articles ,",
    "these fermions were defined , in a mathematically rigorous fashion for six - vertex , cft and sine - gordon models and as an educated conjecture for the sinh - gordon model , and their properties were thoroughly analysed ; in particular for sin(h)-gordon model , the quotient space @xmath2 was shown to allow the following basis :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 and similarly for @xmath13 .",
    "the symbol @xmath14 stands for the _ cardinality _ of the set @xmath15 and the following multi - index notation is introduced :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 and @xmath18 .    while the rigorous construction of this basis , presented in refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite , might appear somewhat cumbersome and hard to understand , when the dust raised by their construction has fallen , the fermions reveal their true strength in the simple and beautiful determinant formula for the one - point functions :    @xmath19    where , for two sets @xmath20 and @xmath21 , the function @xmath22 is defined as follows    @xmath23_{j , k=1}^n\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and the functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 will be defined below . the parameter @xmath26 is related to the conformal dimension of the primary field by    @xmath27    a very important property of the fermions is that , aside from allowing the construction of the descendants , they can be used in order to _ shift _ the primary and descendant fields in their conformal dimension @xmath28 . as it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , if we give up the conditions @xmath29 in favour of the less restraining @xmath30 , then the following relation holds    @xmath31    where @xmath32 and we use the symbol @xmath33 to denote identification in weak sense ( that is , under expectation value ) . +",
    "as was mentioned above , for the sine - gordon model the fermionic basis can be build in a mathematically rigorous fashion ; the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite performed this task by relying on the fact that sine - gordon model allows for a lattice regularization in the form of the eight - vertex model , which is well studied and relatively easy to manage .",
    "conversely , for its twin , the sinh - gordon model , the situation is not so simple : the lattice regularization , in this case , takes the form of a much more complicated model , where the boltzmann weights are defined in terms of the r - matrix of the tensor product of two infinite - dimensional representations of @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "so far the status of the phase transition for this model has not been clarified and , thus , relying on the lattice regularization is not a viable strategy for sinh - gordon model .",
    "an alternative approach is to start directly from the thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba ) equations which , for the sinh - gordon model , exhibit a very simple structure , given the fact that the spectrum of the theory consists of a single particle .",
    "this fact let the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite straightforwardly define all the functions involved in the formula ( [ eq : detformula ] ) .",
    "however that same formula , along with the very existence of the fermionic basis , had to be introduced as a conjecture based on two facts :    * from purely algebraic point of view , the ultra - violet ( uv ) limit of the sinh - gordon model corresponds to the cft considered in ref .",
    "@xcite ; this last theory is , at the same time , the uv limit of the sine - gordon model .",

    "@xcite it was shown how the fermionic basis can be interpreted as a basis of the space of states for which these reflection relations are trivially satisfied .    a remark about the choice for the normalization of the dimensional constant is necessary .",
    "as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , this choice , aside from being extremely convenient for the calculations , encloses serious physical reasons .",
    "firstly it takes automatically into account the change of sign in the potential energy when passing from sinh- to sine - gordon and encodes also the pole at @xmath40 of this last . note that there are poles also for @xmath41 which look natural once one consider the physical scale of the model , namely the mass of the particle @xcite . ] ; more importantly , this normalisation allows the mass m of both the sinh - gordon particle and that of the sine - gordon lowest breather to be expressed by a universal formula :    @xmath42^{1+b^2 } \\ ; .",
    "\\label{eq : massformula}\\ ] ]    since , for the sinh - gordon model , the formula ( [ eq : detformula ] ) and the existence of the fermionic basis still retain the status of conjectures , it is of utmost importance to obtain _ a posteriori _ confirmations of their validity , by checking the predictions against known results .",
    "analytic comparison with results of refs .",

    "@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to obtain further confirmations of the validity of ( [ eq : detformula ] ) , by means of numerical simulations .",
    "in particular the one - point functions of the sinh - gordon model , defined on a cylinder of radius @xmath43 , were numerically evaluated for very small values of the radius @xmath44 , limit in which the model approaches its uv limit ; these numerical results were then compared against the theoretical behaviours obtained in refs . @xcite and @xcite . as in the last - cited article a rescaling of the model to a circumference of fixed radius @xmath45",
    "is to be performed ; this amounts to a renormalisation of the physical mass @xmath46 , so that @xmath47 .",
    "it has to be noted that , since the goal is to compare the results obtained from ( [ eq : detformula ] ) with the known ",
    "cft behaviour \" , it is wise to avoid the possible complications arising in the regions of the parameter space where @xmath48",
    ". let us clarify this point .",
    "looking at the formula for the conformal dimension shift of the fields ( [ eq : shiftformula ] ) we see that the ratio of expectation values of the two primary fields @xmath49 and @xmath50 can be expressed in terms of the ratio of the one - point function of the descendant @xmath51 with that of the primary field @xmath50 ; in formulae    @xmath52    as one approaches the uv limit @xmath53 , the one - point functions of primary fields are believed to behave as three - point functions of the liouville cft @xcite with two additional fields , of dimensions @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the quantized momentum of liouville cft , placed at @xmath56 .",
    "this , however , holds true only if the dimensions of the fields are positive , which means    @xmath57    this fact becomes evident , for example , sending @xmath58 ; in this case , the expectation value of the field @xmath59 can be calculated directly in terms of the ground - state energy @xmath60 where @xcite    @xmath61    and @xmath62 is a constant . with ( [ eq : detformula ] ) ,",

    "let us review briefly the properties of the fermionic basis .",
    "+ the two - fold interpretation of the sinh - gordon action that we mentioned above has an interesting and important consequence . if we look at sinh - gordon as a deformation of the free boson cft , then the natural choice for the descendants of the primary field @xmath72 are normal ordered products of @xmath73 with polynomials of even degree non - trivial subspaces are of even dimension only . ] in the derivatives of @xmath74 . in this _ heisenberg basis _",
    "the one - point functions inherit the natural free boson symmetry    @xmath75    on the other hand , if we consider the sinh - gordon model as a deformation of the liouville cft , the descendants of @xmath50 are more naturally defined as normal - ordered products of @xmath73 with polynomials in even - degree derivatives of @xmath76 and @xmath77 , where    @xmath78 ^ 2 + \\frac{q}{2}\\partial^2\\eta(z,{\\overline{z } } ) \\ : ,     \\nonumber      \\\\      \\\\",

    "it is natural to assume that in this basis , that we call the _ virasoro basis _ , the one - point functions retain the symmetry of the liouville model    @xmath79    since both the heisenberg and the virasoro basis are , when the action of the integrals of motion has been factored out , fully fledged bases of sinh - gordon space of states , the one - point functions in any possible basis have to transform in some definite way under the symmetries @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "this fact gives rise to the above - mentioned reflection relations and suggests that there must exist a basis in which both these symmetries act in a simple , multiplicative way : this particular basis is the _ fermionic basis _ ; we consider then the fermions as defined by their behaviour under the symmetries @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "starting from the liouville cft , where the fermions @xmath82 and @xmath83 can be defined as an intrinsic property of the model @xcite , we see that the reflections act on the fermionic basis as follows :    @xmath84    where    @xmath85    and for the second chirality we only have to change @xmath28 in @xmath86 in the above function .",
