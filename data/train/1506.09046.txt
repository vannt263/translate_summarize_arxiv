    "this work is a continuation of a program of investigation started in @xcite aiming at understanding the influence of a line with its own diffusion embedded in a region where a classical reaction - diffusion process takes place .",
    "the underlying biological motivation is to understand how a line or a network of roads , lines and streams , may enhance biological invasions . besides its obvious motivation from ecology for invading biological species",
    ", this type of questions , also arises in many other contexts , in cellular biology ( for cell division mechanisms , see e.g. @xcite for numerical methods , @xcite for mathematical study by entropy methods ) , chemical engineering ( crystal growth processes , see @xcite ) or biophysics ( see e.g. @xcite for a linear stability analysis ) and medicine , sometimes in three dimensional regions bounded by a surface having certain properties different from the ones in the bulk .",
    "there are many situations where networks of lines play a major role . in epidemiology",
    ", the spreading of certain diseases is known to be strongly dependent on the communication network . in the classical example of the `` black death '' plague in the middle of the 14th century ,",
    "the roads connecting trade fair cities allowed the epidemics to expand northward at a fast pace .",
    "the account by @xcite describes how it then further spread inwards from these roads to eventually cover whole territories . a recent invasive species in europe , related to climate change , the pine processionary moth has progressed at a faster rate than anticipated .",
    "an hypothesis in this context is the role played by roads in allowing jumps .",
    "see the update in the interdisciplinary volume @xcite on this issue and the related public health concerns .",
    "another example of the effect of lines on propagation in open space comes from the influence of seismic lines on movements of wolves in the western canadian forest .",
    "these are straight lines dug across territories by oil companies for the purpose of exploring and monitoring oil reservoirs .",
    "the study in @xcite reports the observation that populations of wolves tend to move and concentrate on seismic lines , allowing them to move along larger distances .    in @xcite , @xcite ,",
    "three of the authors introduced and studied a new model to describe invasions in the plane when a fast diffusion takes place on a straight line . in this model ,",
    "the line @xmath0 in the plane @xmath1 - referred to as `` the road '' - carries a density @xmath2 of the population .",
    "the rest of the plane is called `` the field '' , and the density there is denoted by @xmath3 . by symmetry , the problem may be restricted to the upper half - plane @xmath4 , where the dynamics is assumed to be represented by a standard fisher - kpp equation with diffusivity @xmath5 .",
    "there is no reproduction on the road , where the diffusivity coefficient is another constant @xmath6 . the road and the field exchange individuals .",
    "the flux condition results from the road yielding a proportion @xmath7 of @xmath8 to the field , and a proportion @xmath9 of @xmath10 jumping from the field on the road .",
    "the opposite of the flux for @xmath11 appears as a source term in the equation for @xmath8 .",
    "the system thus reads as follows : @xmath12 where @xmath13 are positive constants and the function @xmath14 is smooth and satisfies the fisher - kpp condition : @xmath15 the initial conditions are : @xmath16 let @xmath17 denote the classical fisher  kpp spreading velocity ( or invasion speed ) in the field : @xmath18 the fundamental paper @xcite analyzed the solution to the problem @xmath19 among other things , @xcite shows that , modulo a shift in time , the solution converges to a travelling wave of speed @xmath17 .",
    "this is also the asymptotic speed at which the population would spread in any direction in the open space - in the absence of the road - starting from a confined distribution , i.e. with compact support ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the main result of @xcite is the following    [ t1.2 ] there exists @xmath20 such that , if @xmath21 is the solution of emanating from an arbitrary nonnegative , compactly supported , initial condition @xmath22 , it holds that @xmath23 moreover , @xmath24 if and only if @xmath25 , and @xmath26    in other words , the solution spreads at velocity @xmath27 in the direction of the road , and the propagation is strongly enhanced when @xmath6 is large , even though there is no reproduction on the road .",
    "this theorem is completed in @xcite by a precise study of the expansion in the field and the determination of the asymptotic speed of propagation in every direction .",

    "moreover , @xmath34 and , if @xmath35 , there is @xmath36 such that @xmath37 if and only if @xmath38 .",
    "this theorem provides the spreading velocity in every direction @xmath39 , and reveals a critical angle phenomenon : the road influences the propagation on the field not only in the horizontal direction , but rather up to an angle @xmath40 from it .",
    "it is further shown in @xcite that @xmath41 as @xmath42 .",
    "the theorem is illustrated by the numerical simulation of figure [ laplathese ] , reported from the second author s phd thesis @xcite .",
    ", width=529 ]    see also the review @xcite for a discussion of some of these aspects , as well as some open questions .",
    "model is an example of propagation guided by a set of lower dimension , a topic that has recently attracted much interest .",
    "see for instance @xcite and @xcite for non - local models for front propagation guided by favored genetic traits , and @xcite for the study of fronts guided by a line . in the case of interest here , the scenario depicted by theorems [ t1.2]-[t1.1 ] displays a _ propagation speed - up _ , or propagation enhancement : the spreading velocity can be much larger than the reference speed @xmath17 , but remains asymptotically constant .",
    "one may wonder if different conditions may lead , not only to speed - up , but _",
    "acceleration _ : in other words , the front velocity increases in time . in we have only considered standard , local diffusion .",
    "so , it is natural to ask if non - local diffusion will accelerate the propagation , rather than only speed it up .",
    "the goal of this paper is to investigate this question .",
    "to account for the possibility that individuals on the road may move much faster than in the field , we will consider a non - local diffusion on the road : this means that the underlying processes modelling the displacement of individuals are jump processes . when those are stable lvy processes , the corresponding diffusion operator is the fractional laplacian : this is the choice we make here .",
    "thus the system under study is @xmath43 we assume that the reaction term @xmath14 is strictly concave and smooth , with @xmath44 .",
    "this assumption will always be understood in the following without further reference .",
    "note that the second equation , representing the evolution of the density on the road , does not involve a reproduction term , but only possibly a mortality term @xmath45 , with @xmath46 constant .",
    "the exchange factor @xmath7 is a positive constant and we assume , without loss of generality , that @xmath47 .",
    "the operator @xmath48 , @xmath49 , is the fractional laplacian @xmath50 the constant @xmath51 is adjusted so that @xmath48 is a pseudo - differential operator with symbol @xmath52 .",
    "note that , when @xmath53 this has to be taken in the sense of convergent integrals , while when @xmath54 this definition should be understood in the principal values sense .",
    "we complete the system with bounded , continuous initial conditions @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to understand how , and at what speed , the level sets of @xmath8 and @xmath11 will spread for large times .",
    "we will see that , in this system , propagation takes advantage of both the fast diffusion on the road and the mass creation term in the field .",
    "the first step is to identify a unique steady state of the system and to show that it is the global attractor of the evolution problem .",
    "[ cvstat ] problem admits a unique positive , bounded stationary solution @xmath57 .",
    "moreover , @xmath57 is @xmath58-independent , and solutions @xmath21 to starting from nonnegative , bounded initial data @xmath22 satisfy @xmath59 locally uniformly in @xmath60 .",
    "this liouville - type result is a consequence of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , it is shown in lemma 2.3 there that the solution @xmath21 to lies asymptotically between two positive @xmath58-independent stationary solutions @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "one can check that this property is proved without exploiting the equation on the road , and hence it holds true for .",
    "notice that @xmath61 and @xmath62 are solutions to as well , because they are @xmath58-independent .",
    "then , proposition 3.1 of @xcite implies that admits a unique positive @xmath58-independent stationary solution @xmath57 , concluding the proof of theorem [ cvstat ] .",
    "in the case without mortality ( @xmath63 ) we have the trivial solution @xmath64 ( recall that @xmath47 ) . in general , @xmath65 and we know that @xmath66 .",
    "the issue is now to track the invasion front , and this is done in the next two theorems .",
    "[ mainthm2d ] _ ( propagation on the road ) .",
    "_ let @xmath21 be the solution of starting from a nonnegative , compactly supported initial condition @xmath22 . then , setting @xmath67    1 .",
    "@xmath68 , 2 .",
    "@xmath69    thus , the process at work on the road is the same as that of an effective reaction - diffusion equation of the form : @xmath70 where @xmath71 . in particular , spreading will occur at the same rate as was computed in @xcite for this equation ( see also @xcite ) , despite the fact that there is no reproduction on the road .",
    "thus , the road has once again a dramatic effect , and we have therefore identified a new mechanism for front acceleration .",

    "@xmath74 , 2 .   @xmath75 .",
    "the speed of propagation in the direction @xmath76 is thus asymptotically equal to @xmath77 .",
    "when @xmath78 is close to @xmath79 , this speed tends to infinity , which is consistent with theorem [ mainthm2d ] . and so , the front is , asymptotically , close to a straight line parallel to the @xmath58-axis moving vertically at velocity @xmath17 .",
    "one may interpret it as follows : the invasion on the road is so fast that the whole system behaves just as if the density in the field only saw the condition @xmath80 at the boundary , as in the effective equation @xmath81 with @xmath82 it is easy to see that this gives the correct behavior , by trapping @xmath3 between two suitable translates of the solutions of @xmath83 for every small arbitrary @xmath84 .",
    "the whole scenario is summarized by the numerical simulation of figure [ fracthese ] , once again reported from @xcite :    , width=529 ]      first , we give a brief overview of the context of the problem we study here in section [ sec : review ] .",
    "there we present a review of the existing literature related to our model : propagation enhancement , propagation acceleration , as well as further results obtained on the model .",
    "the proof of the exponential in time asymptotic spreading in our model starts in section 4 , where we outline the strategy of the proof of theorem [ mainthm2d ] .",
    "the idea is to trap the solution between a supersolution and a subsolution whose level sets move asymptotically at the same speed .",
    "this turns out to be a rather delicate task , the construction of the supersolution being quite different from that of the sub - solution .",
    "the former is achieved in section  [ sec : super ] , together with the main computations .",
    "section [ sec : auxiliary ] is devoted to the construction of an auxiliary subsolution for a 1d transport equation .",
    "this is the building block used in the rather computational section [ sec : road ] to obtain the subsolution to the full system",
    ". some weaker versions of the second statement of theorems [ mainthm2d ] and [ propagationfield2 ] - with the convergence to @xmath85 and @xmath86 replaced by a positive lower bound - are derived in sections [ sec : fitting ] and [ longtimebehavior ] respectively .",
    "these bounds are used in section [ sec : stronger ] to complete the proofs of theorems [ mainthm2d ] and [ propagationfield2 ] .",
    "finally , an appendix studies the cauchy problem for and provides regularity and a comparison principle , similar to that of @xcite .",
    "in this section , we present a general overview on front propagation enhancement , which has seen an important development in the last 15 years .",
    "we start with the case of a single local equation . in the second subsection ,",
    "we present further results obtained on . in the last one",
    ", we give an overview of the mathematical literature on accelerating fronts .",
    "it is well known that diffusion , when coupled with reaction , gives rise to propagating fronts .",
    "the most common situation is the development of fronts travelling at constant speed .",
    "the basic result concerns front spreading in a homogeneous medium .",
    "let us recall its main features .",
    "the equation reads @xmath87 we are looking for a function @xmath88 such that @xmath89        a fundamental result in this direction is that of aronson - weinberger @xcite , which accounts for how a front develops from a compactly supported datum .",

    "@xmath92 .    in other words , holds with @xmath93 .",
    "an important literature has developed from there ; to discuss it is out of the scope of this paper .",
    "let us just mention the forthcoming book @xcite , which provides a complete overview of the question .",
    "in the presence of heterogeneities , quantifying propagation can be quite difficult .",
    "the pioneering work in this field goes back to the probabilistic arguments of freidlin and grtner @xcite .",
    "they studied kpp - type propagation in a periodic environment and showed that the speed of propagation is no longer isotropic : propagation in any direction is influenced by all the other directions in the environment .",
    "they provide an explicit formula for the computation of the propagation speed .",
    "many works have followed since then , we mention for instance the references @xcite for a definition and estimates of the spreading speed in periodic environment , @xcite for the particular case of space dimension 1 , and @xcite for a general definition in arbitrary heterogeneous media , as well as new estimates of the heat kernel .    reaction - diffusion equations in heterogeneous media since then is an active field and the question how the environment may enhance propagation has received much attention .",
    "the first paper in the domain is that of audoly , berestycki and pomeau @xcite , which studies models of the form @xmath94 where @xmath95 is large and @xmath96 is an imposed divergence free flow field .",
    "they propose , by a formal analysis , various asymptotics for the propagation velocity , in particular if @xmath97 is a shear flow @xmath98 or a periodic cellular flow field .",
    "this has triggered a series of mathematical works ; let us first mention a general deep estimate by constantin , kiselev , oberman and ryzhik @xcite of the _ bulk burning rate _ of , defined as : @xmath99 this quantity turns out to be a relevant one , especially in problems where the flow is time - dependent or strongly heterogeneous - thus precluding the reduction of the problem to travelling or pulsating waves .",
    "the study of speed - up properties of propagation by an advecting velocity field is continued , in a mathematically rigorous fashion , in @xcite .",
    "this work derives upper and lower bounds for in terms of @xmath100 : @xmath101 for shear flows , and @xmath102 for cellular flows .",
    "when the flow is a steady shear flow , a recent paper of hamel and zlatos @xcite makes the kiselev - ryzhik upper bound sharp : under a hrmander type condition on @xmath103 , there exists @xmath104 such that the velocity @xmath105 of travelling fronts of satisfies @xmath106 .",
    "moreover the quantity @xmath107 is the unique admissible velocity for the following degenerate system with unknowns @xmath108 and @xmath109 : @xmath110 a similar situation will be discussed in the next section .    for reaction terms @xmath14 which are of the fisher - kpp type",
    ", there is a relation between the principal eigenvalue and the amplitude of the velocity field , which has motivated the paper by berestycki , hamel and nadirashvili @xcite on principal eigenvalue problems of the form @xmath111 @xmath112 being the eigenvalue that is sought .",
    "the link between the existence or nonexistence of a first integral for the flow , and the size of @xmath112 , is elucidated .",
    "the qualitative properties of model have been studied further , with the discovery of new effects . in what follows , we list some natural questions and the answers that have been given .",
    "whether this asymptotic persists if the nonlinear term @xmath14 is changed to a different type of source term is not obvious .",
    "indeed , _ a priori _ trivial question ; this could indeed be thought of as a special property of models with fisher - kpp type nonlinearities . moreover , the asymptotic for the velocity is obtained through algebraic computations .",
    "so , it is quite natural to ask whether this result persists with more general nonlinearities , where explicit computations are not longer possible .",
    "and , indeed , the property seems to be general , as shown by dietrich @xcite , @xcite .",
    "consider the situation where @xmath114 is the strip @xmath115 , with neumann boundary condition at @xmath116 .",
    "the function @xmath14 vanishes on an interval @xmath117 $ ] , and is positive on @xmath118 . then admits a unique travelling wave velocity @xmath119 .",
    "moreover , the velocity still grows like @xmath120 : we have @xmath121 , where @xmath122 is the unique @xmath123 such that the following problem admits solution : @xmath124 .",
    "\\end{cases}\\ ] ] this is reminiscent of the hamel - zlatos situation , although the speed - up mechanism is quite different .",
    "another natural question is what happens if nonuniform transport effects are included . in the following model",
    ", we assume that on the road there is a constant transport @xmath96 as well as a constant mortality rate @xmath125 .",
    "the conditions in the field remain unchanged .",
    "the equations for @xmath8 and @xmath11 thus read : @xmath126 in @xcite , it is proved that problem admits asymptotic speeds of spreading @xmath127 in the directions @xmath128 . moreover , if @xmath129 , then @xmath130 , else @xmath131 .",
    "let us give a brief biological interpretation of this result .",
    "for definiteness , let us consider propagation to the right ( that is , in the direction @xmath132 ) .",
    "first we see some expected effects : mortality on the road makes speed - up more difficult by raising the threshold for @xmath133 past which the effect of the road is felt . on the contrary ,",
    "a transport @xmath134 on the road facilitates speed - up ( to the right ) by lowering the threshold .",
    "when @xmath135 , the threshold is raised by the same factor .    a less expected consequence is the following . in the absence of mortality on the road",
    ", the threshold condition reads @xmath136 in other words , a transport @xmath96 larger than @xmath17 speeds up propagation , no matter what the diffusivity ratio is .",
    "biological situations are , for instance , the spreading of a parasite by a river , as reported for instance in @xcite . for values of @xmath96 less than @xmath137 - and , in particular , for large values of @xmath138 - spreading towards right occurs at the kpp velocity : in biological terms , propagation upstream against a river flow remains unaffected , whereas downstream propagation , in the direction of the flow , can be strongly enhanced .",
    "this yields a remarkable assymetry which , as a matter of fact , is also felt in the field : the asymptotic shape of the front may deviate significantly from that computed in the absence of flow field ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) .      up to now , we considered exchanges between the road and the field taking place in the infinitesimal vicinity of the road .",
    "it is therefore a natural question to examine the influence of the range of exchanges between the road and the field , in other words what happens when the exchanges are nonlocal .",
    "this was recently investigated by pauthier , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the model under study is @xmath139 the functions @xmath7 and @xmath9 are smooth , @xmath140 functions : individuals can jump away from the road , but only very few of them can go very far from it .",
    "notice that the initial model is retrieved from , at least formally , by setting @xmath141 where @xmath142 and @xmath143 are two positive given constants .",
    "the question is how the spreading velocity is modified by the introduction of this non locality .",
    "pauthier shows that the thresholds are quite stable , but also discovers surprising effects .    1 .",
    "_ propagation enhancement . _",
    "the threshold @xmath144 is still there @xcite : if @xmath145 , we have @xmath146 ; if @xmath25 , then @xmath24 . moreover , there is @xmath122 such that @xmath113 as @xmath147 .",
    "the dynamics when @xmath7 and @xmath9 are close to dirac masses is also quite stable @xcite : if @xmath148 converge to @xmath149 , then ( i ) @xmath150 as @xmath151 , and ( ii ) the limits @xmath152 and @xmath153 commute . 2 .   _",
    "variation of the spreading velocity with the range of @xmath7 and @xmath9 .",
    "_ how does @xmath119 then vary when @xmath7 and @xmath9 vary , their masses being respectively kept equal to @xmath142 and @xmath143 ?",
    "( i ) a new threshold ( @xcite ) . take @xmath154 , the functions @xmath155 and @xmath156 having masses @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "then , if @xmath157 is the spreading speed , it holds that @xmath158 ( ii ) moreover ( see @xcite ) , contrary to what intuition suggests , the spreading velocity is not always maximized - under the constraint that the masses of @xmath7 and @xmath9 are kept equal to the constants @xmath142 and @xmath143 - when exchanges are localized on the road .",
    "the speed - up effects observed in the original model are displayed in other various situations .",
    "consider , for instance , a strip bounded by the road on one side and with dirichlet boundary conditions on the other . in this case , tellini @xcite proves the existence of an asymptotic speed of propagation which is greater than that of the case without road and studies its behavior in the limits @xmath159 and @xmath42 .",
    "when the width of the strip goes to infinity , the asymptotic speed of propagation approaches the one of the half - plane model .",
    "equations have also an interest in higher dimensions , where they arise as models in medicine .",
    "one motivation would be to model the diffusion of a drug within a body through the blood network .",
    "the analysis of an @xmath160-dimensional model is achieved by rossi , tellini and valdinoci @xcite .",
    "the authors consider a circular cylinder with fast diffusion at the boundary , which reduces to a strip between two parallel roads in the bidimensional case . the picture obtained in @xcite",
    "is similar to the ones described before : enhancement of the spreading velocity occurs if and only if the ratio between the diffusivities on the boundary and inside the cylinder is above a certain threshold .",
    "the authors investigate the dependence of the spreading velocity with respect to the radius @xmath161 of the cylinder , discovering that it is monotone increasing if the ratio between the diffusivities is below 2 , whereas , if the ratio is larger than 2 , the dependence is no longer monotone and there exists a critical radius @xmath162 maximizing the velocity .",
    "let us end this review with the recent preprint @xcite by giletti , monsaingeon and zhou , which extends theorem [ t1.2 ] to the situation where @xmath7 and @xmath9 are replaced by 1-periodic functions .      as opposed to the previous situation , non - local diffusion may cause acceleration of fronts .",
    "this phenomenon has also long been identified . in the context of ecology , kot , lewis and van den driessche @xcite study , both numerically and heuristically , discrete time models of the form @xmath163 when the decay of the convolution kernel @xmath125 is slow enough , the authors observe accelerating profiles rather than travelling waves .",
    "similar properties have been noticed , still from the numerical point of view or in the formal style , for models with continuous time , e.g. reaction - diffusion equations of the form : @xmath164 where @xmath14 is of the fisher - kpp type , and @xmath165 a non - local diffusive operator .",
    "typical examples are @xmath166 , or @xmath167 ( notice that , with this last kernel , is the exact analogue of ) .",
    "see @xcite for a rather complete review .",
    "the basic heuristic argument for acceleration is the following : since @xmath14 is concave , a good approximation of the dynamics of is given by that of the linearized equation ; this entails studying the level sets of @xmath168 in the case @xmath169 , and for a compactly supported datum @xmath170 , we have @xmath171 , yielding that the level sets of @xmath11 spread like @xmath172 .",
    "more generally , if @xmath173 decays spatially slower than any exponential , this yields accelerating level sets .",
    "mathematically rigorous proofs of acceleration , and precise identifications of the mechanisms responsible for acceleration , are more recent .",

    "when @xmath165 is of the convolution type , the relevant result is that of garnier @xcite , who proves : ( i ) super - linear spreading for as soon as the convolution kernel @xmath125 decays more slowly than any exponential , ( ii ) exponential spreading when @xmath125 decays algebraically at infinity .",
    "the precise exponents are not , however , given .",
    "accelerating fronts can be observed in even when @xmath182 : hamel and roques prove , in @xcite , that it is enough to replace the compactly supported initial datum with a slowly decaying one .",
    "this paper is also the first to identify , in an explicit way , that the correct dynamics of the level sets is given by that of the level sets of the ode @xmath183    whether or not theorem [ t2.01 ] is sharp is a natural question .",
    "one may indeed wonder whether the exponentials should be corrected by sub - exponential factors .",
    "cabr , and the second and third authors prove in @xcite that the exponentials are indeed sharp , in other words that any level set is trapped in an annulus whose inner and outer radii are constant multiples of @xmath172 . for that , they devise a new methodology which extends to the treatment of the models of the form @xmath184 with @xmath185 and 1-periodic .",
    "surprisingly enough , the invasion property can still be described by the single function @xmath186 , where @xmath187 is the first periodic eigenvalue of @xmath188 .",
    "the method consists in two steps : ( i ) one shows that @xmath189 decays at the same rate as the fractional heat kernel , ( ii ) one constructs a pair of sub and supersolutions that have exactly the right growth for large times and the right decay for large @xmath58 .",
    "this proved to be a more precise approach than all the previous studies , which mainly relied on the analysis of the linear equation .",
    "this mechanism , which is quite different from what happens in the case @xmath190 , was later on described by mlard and mirrahimi @xcite , with a different viewpoint .",
