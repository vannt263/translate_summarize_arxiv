    "but for the gzk effect , its shape is that of the source h flux , since protons at that energy should escape other galaxies directly , and enter ours unhindered .",

    "the sn rate per unit volume is measured in the local universe .",
    "the overall flux is the result of the integration over redshift of the flux from past sne",

    "the integration in @xmath51 is an integration over look - back time , as opposed to distance , since crs do not travel straight .",
    "the error in the result is hard to estimate , its central value is within a factor of 2 of the observations ( dd06 ) .",
    "this explains the coincidence that the ankle is the escape energy of protons from the galaxy _ and _ the place where the extragalactic flux not enhanced by confinement and thus less steep begins to dominate .      in the standard paradigm crs",
    "are accelerated by the nonrelativistic ejecta of sne .",
    "sne occur mainly in the central realms of the galaxy , so that crs must diffuse to arrive to our location . a directional asymmetry is predicted , and not observed@xcite . for cr electrons",
    "the problem is even more severe : their cooling time in the galaxy s light , and magnetic fields , is so short that they should have lost all their energy on their way here .",
    "our source distribution is totally non - standard , cbs generate crs all along their many - kpc - long trajectories , see eq .",

    "if a galactic sn occurs every 50 years , and emits an average of 10 cbs , there are currently several thousand cbs in the galaxy and its halo .",
    "this is a very diffuse cr source , satisfactory in view of the previous paragraph .",
    "we have not yet studied the cr source - distribution and diffusion in detail .",

    "a more careful analysis reveals a significant correlation of its intensity with our position relative to the galactic centre@xcite .",
    "the cb - model reproduces this correlation , provided a good fraction of the gbr is generated by cr electrons at high galactic latitudes , as they cool radiatively by the very same process that steepens their spectrum .",

    "the observed one@xcite is @xmath267 .",
    "the answer is simple .",
    "the cbs of sne are tiny astrophysical objects : their typical mass is half of the mass of mercury .",
    "their energy flux at all frequencies is @xmath268 , large only when their lorentz factors are large .",

    "we claim that the data agree with our expectations , including the predicted inter - cb separation@xcite of fig .",
    "the observers claimed the contrary , though the evidence for the weaker ` second component ' is @xmath270 .",
    "they report@xcite that this component is ` not expected in the standard model ' .",
    "the unpublished and no - doubt spectacular - discovery picture of the two superluminally moving sources would have been worth a thousand words ... in support of the cb model .",
    "we have defended the simplistic view that cbs from sne is all one needs to generate crs at all energies .",
    "the recent data of auger@xcite show a significant correlation between the arrival directions of ultra - high energy crs ( uhecrs ) and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) located within a distance of 75 mpc ( @xmath271 ) , comparable to the gzk ` horizon ' at the observed energies , @xmath272 eev .",
    "as the authors discuss , this does not mean that agns are the actual sources@xcite , for agns are themselves correlated with matter and with active regions of enhanced stellar birth and death .",
    "more work on correlations is no doubt in progress .",
    "a search for correlations with grbs is less hopeful , for the fraction of them observed from within @xmath271 is negligible , and the observed ` correlated ' crs may have been bent by magnetic fields up to a few degrees , implying a possible delay of millenia between the arrival times of @xmath1 s and crs .",
    "observations of agns are an ingredient of the ` inspiration ' of the cb model , as we have discussed in connection with pictor a , see fig .",
    "[ pictor]a , b .",
    "naturally , we have estimated their contribution to the uhecr proton flux , concluding that they may constitute at most 1 to 10% of the flux generated by extragalactic sne ( dd04 ) .",
    "the estimate is for the energy - integrated flux ; in applying it to uhecrs we assumed the same energy dependence for the flux generated by the same mechanisms by the cbs of sne and agns ( a small difference of spectral index implies an enormous uncertainty ) . in a subsequent study@xcite of the cr electron flux , assumed to be in a fixed proportion to the proton flux , we used more recent inputs , and simplified and modified our upper limit to @xmath273% .",
    "but we forgot to extract the putative consequences for the agn contribution to uhecr protons !",
    "we do not have a solid understanding of accretion onto black holes or neutron stars .",
    "but such processes are observed to result in the ejection of relativistic and highly collimated jets .",
    "we assumed that a similar process takes place as a stellar core collapses , leading to a supernova event .",
    "we posited that the sn s relativistic ejecta two jets of cannonballs are the sources of grbs and crs .",
    "the association between sne and ( long ) grbs is now established .",
    "we argued that the electrons in a cb , by inverse compton scattering on the illuminated surroundings of the exploding star , generate the @xmath1 rays , x - rays , uv and optical light of the ` prompt ' phase of a grb .",
    "the ensuing results are the simplest and most predictive , they are a firm ` theory ' . in this paper",
    "i have , however , followed the historical development , in which the cb parameters were first extracted from the observations of the afterglow of grbs .",
    "this involves a ` model ' , a set of arguable but simple hypothesis leading to the prediction of the properties of the ag dominated by synchrotron radiation by the ism electrons that a cb intercepts as a function of frequency and time . in the historical order the ` prompt ' results for grbs are predictions of the theory .",
    "some results for cosmic rays the ism particles that cbs scatter in their journey are also ` theory ' , others can be viewed as further tests of the ` model ' .",
    "the results for grb afterglows may be based on a simplified model , but they work with no exception all the way from radio to x - rays ( ddd02,03 ) . in particular , they describe correctly grb 980425 , located at a redshift two orders of magnitude closer than average .",
    "its associated sn is the one we ` transported ' to conclude thanks to the reliability of our ag model that core - collapse sne generate long grbs ( ddd02 ) .",
    "the x - ray light curve of grb 980425 and a few others , with extremely scarce data , was described with the ` canonical ' properties later observed in detail in many swift - era grbs .",
    "it is not recognized that the two cbs of grb 030329 were seen , or that their separation in the sky was the predicted ` hyper - luminal ' one . in view of the overall success of the cb model ,",
    "this is a durable hurdle : grbs so close and luminous are very rare .",
    "the accuracy of the predictions for the prompt phase of grbs amazes even the cb - model s proponents .",
    "the typical values and the correlations between the @xmath1-ray prompt observables leave little doubt that the production mechanism is inverse compton scattering on ` ambient ' light of @xmath10 ev energy .",
    "the approximate scaling law @xmath274 spectacularly confirmed in the case of xrf 060218 demonstrates that the light is that of a ` glory ' : the early sn light scattered by the ` windy ' pre - sn ejecta . a grb spectrum that works even better@xcite than the phenomenological ` band ' expression is also predicted .",
    "the flux and its spectral evolution during the prompt and rapid - decline phases are the expected ones , as we tested in minute detail with swift data .    in the internal - external fireball model of grbs ,",
    "highly relativistic thin conical shells of @xmath85 pairs , sprinkled with a finely tuned baryon ` load ' , collide with each other generating a shock that accelerates their constituents and creates magnetic fields .",
    "each collision of two shells produces a grb pulse by synchrotron radiation .",
    "the ensemble of shells collides with the ism to produce the ag by the same mechanism .",
    "the energy available to produce the grb pulse as two shells moving in the _ same _ direction collide is more than one order of magnitude smaller than that of the merged shells as they collide with the ism at rest .",
    "the ratio of observed grb and ag energies is more than one order of magnitude , but in the opposite direction .",
    "this ` energy crisis ' in the comparison of bolometric prompt and ag fluences@xcite is not resolved .",
    "moreover , the grb spectrum can not be accommodated on grounds of synchrotron radiation@xcite , the ` standard ' prompt mechanism .",
    "the swift - era observations also pose decisive problems to the standard model , whose microphysics@xcite , reliance on shocks@xcite and correlations based on the jet - opening angle@xcite have to be abandoned , according to the cited authors .    in spite of the above",
    ", the defenders of the fireball model are not discouraged .",
    "their attitude towards the cb model , whose observational support is so remarkable , is not equally supportive .",
    "this may be due to cultural differences .",
    "particle physicists believe that complex phenomena may have particularly simple explanations .",
    "they thrive on challenging their standard views .",
    "doubting or abandoning a previous consensus in astrophysics is less easy .",
    "the cb - model description of cosmic rays is also simplistic : there is only one source of ( non - solar ) crs at all energies , and only one parameter to be fit .",
    "the model has a certain inevitability : if cbs with the properties deduced from grb physics are a reality , what do they do as they scatter the particles of the interstellar medium ? we have argued that they transmogrify them into crs with all of their observed properties .",
    "the mechanism is entirely analogous to the ics responsible for a grb s prompt radiation .",
    "suffice it to substitute the cb s electron , plus the ambient photon , by a moving - cb s inner magnetic field , plus an ambient nucleus or electron .",
    "after a century of cr measurements , the cb - model results lack the glamour of predictions . yet , the expectations for the knee energies , and for the relative abundances of crs , are ` kinematical ' , simple , and verified .",
    "they constitute evidence , in my opinion , that the underlying model is basically correct .",
    "the prediction for the shape of the spectra : the low energy hips , the large energy stretch very well described by a power - law of ( source ) index @xmath275 , and the steepening at the knees , are also verified .",
    "the index @xmath276 is measured well enough for the adequacy of the prediction to be sensitive to the details of the underlying model , such as the form of the function @xmath114 in eq .",
    "( [ radius ] ) .",
    "i can not claim that the fact that the prediction is right on the mark is much more than a consistency test , for the physics underlying this aspect of the problem may be terrifyingly complex .",
    "the same cr source cannonballs from supernovae , this time extragalactic satisfactorily describes the cr data above the ankle . finally , the properties of cr electrons , and of the high - latitude gamma ` background ' radiation , are also correctly reproduced .",
    "most cr scholars agree with the ` standard ' paradigm that the flux well below the knee is produced by the acceleration of the ism in the frontal shocks of the nonrelativistic ejecta of sne . in spite of recent observations of large magnetic fields@xcite in collisions of sn shells and molecular clouds ,",
    "nobody has been able to argue convincingly that this process can accelerate particles up to the ( modest ) energy of the knee , _ and _ to show that the number and efficiency of the putative sources suffices to generate the observed cr luminosity ( to my satisfaction , i add , to make these statements indisputable ) . from this point on",
    ", there is no ` standard ' consensus on the origin of crs , e.g. ,  of the highest - energy ones . in this sense ,",
    "the cb model is regarded as yet another model , which it is .",
    "after all , we are only saying that crs are accelerated by the jetted relativistic ejecta of sne , as opposed to the quasi - spherical , non - relativistic ones .",
    "yet , the cb model is also rejected by the cr experts , sometimes even in print@xcite , though it survives the critique@xcite .",
    "but , concerning crs , the model does not trigger the same indignant wrath as in the grb realm .",
    "i have shown that the problem of grbs is convincingly i.e .",
    "predictively solved and that , on the same simple basis , all properties of crs can be easily derived .",
    "only an overwhelmed minority recognizes these facts , in contradiction with popper s and ockham s teachings .",
    "i would conclude with a dictum attributed to lev landau : _ ` in astrophysics , theories never die , only people do . ' _"
