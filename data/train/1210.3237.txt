    "on the way to scalable quantum information processing majorana fermions ( mf ) in topological superconductors are a promising candidate for the implementation of quantum bits in solid - state devices @xcite . since information in such systems is stored and processed in a nonlocal fashion by means of their non - abelian statistics @xcite , majorana - based qubits are immune to local fermionic parity conserving perturbations which impair other qubit realizations .",
    "manipulation of such topologically protected qubits requires braiding of mfs , which is well - defined only in two dimensions . however , different schemes have been proposed @xcite to enable braiding of mf in one dimensional systems . several suggestions for one - dimensional physical realizations that host majorana bound states ( mbs ) have been made .",
    "these suggestions are based on conventional superconductors in proximity to various systems including a topological insulator edge @xcite , semiconductor wires in a magnetic field @xcite , and half metals @xcite .",
    "recently , more realistic investigations have elucidated the effects of interactions and disorder . in general interactions @xcite or disorder with short range correlations @xcite can greatly affect the range of parameters in which the system supports topological boundary states or even cause the topological phase to break down completely if the interaction @xcite or disorder @xcite strength exceed certain critical values .",
    "long - range correlated disorder in a topological superconductor creates nontopological domains with mf localized at the domain walls @xcite .",
    "several proposals have been put forward to access mfs experimentally based on interferometry @xcite or transport properties such as tunneling conductance peak @xcite , half - integer conductance plateaus @xcite , or signatures in the shot noise @xcite .",
    "recent experiments have reported possible signatures of majorana bound states in the differential tunneling conductance of semiconductor quantum wires @xcite .",
    "a more specific way of detecting mfs is to measure the josephson current across a weak link between two topological superconductors @xcite that arises due to a phase difference of the superconducting order parameters .",
    "if the weak link is incorporated into a ring made of a conventional superconductor , the current flowing through the junction is a periodic function of flux with period @xmath2 ( corresponding to @xmath3 periodicity in the phase difference ) , associated with the transfer of cooper pairs across the junction . in a ring made of a topological superconductor",
    ", there is a mbs on each side of the junction and the tunneling current obtains a component that is @xmath1 periodic @xcite ( corresponding to @xmath4 periodicity in the phase difference ) .",
    "this doubling of the flux period with respect to the ordinary josephson effect originates from single - electron tunneling mediated by the mbs and is dubbed fractional josephson effect .",
    "the @xmath1-periodic josephson current is observed as long as the fermion number parity of the system is conserved .",
    "once the system is in strict thermodynamic equilibrium , including relaxation processes which change fermion parity , the josephson current reverts to the conventional @xmath2 periodicity .",
    "indeed , the @xmath1-periodic josephson current has equal magnitude but opposite signs for even and odd fermion parities , so that it averages to zero in the presence of fermion - parity changing processes .",
    "possible workarounds that do not require strict parity conservation rely on the @xmath5 josephson effect @xcite , or finite - frequency current noise @xcite .",
    "experimental signatures of a fractional josephson effect in shapiro step measurements have been claimed recently @xcite .",
    "here we show that in mesoscopic rings with a weak link , the presence of majorana fermions can lead to an @xmath1-periodic josephson current even in thermodynamic equilibrium and in the presence of fermion - parity - breaking relaxation processes .",
    "this @xmath1-periodic contribution exists in the topological superconducting phase and peaks in magnitude near the topological phase transition , providing an experimental signature of the phase transition .",
    "we investigate this signature for a spinless @xmath0-wave superconductor wire , the kitaev chain @xcite . which is a paradigmatic model exhibiting a topological phase transition .",
    "this model also arises as an effective low - energy theory in more realistic situations such as the quantum - wire proposals of refs .   and .",
    "in a ring geometry , the majorana bound states hybridize not only due to the tunneling across the weak link but also through the superconducting interior of the ring .",
    "the latter overlap is exponentially small in the ratio of the ring circumference and the superconducting coherence length governing the spatial extent of the majorana bound states .",
    "as one approaches the topological phase transition , the superconducting coherence length diverges and the interior overlap between the majorana bound states becomes significant .",
    "this causes a peak of the @xmath1-periodic josephson current near the topological phase transition .    after discussing this effect in clean rings ,",
    "we extend our considerations to disordered rings .",
    "we show that the signature of the topological phase transition is robust and survives under more realistic conditions .",
    "this issue also leads us to study the influence of disorder in the vicinity of the topological phase transition of the kitaev chain which had not been discussed previously .",
    "previous work @xcite on disorder effects in the kitaev chain or models of quantum wires focused on the regime of large chemical potential ( measured from the lower band edge ) , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 denotes the effective @xmath0-wave order parameter of the kitaev chain in the continuum limit . in this regime ,",

    "conversely , when tunneling across the weak link is negligible compared to the interior hybridization , the splitting of the majoranas due to the interior overlap does not depend on flux .",
    "weak tunneling across the junction will then cause a small @xmath1-periodic modulation of the split majorana levels with flux .",

    "but they also show that an @xmath1-periodic contribution to the equilibrium josephson current exists even when the interior splitting is of the order of or smaller than the tunnel coupling across the weak link .",
    "indeed , the interior overlap essentially pushes one of the two states ( dashed line ) up in energy , while it pushes its particle - hole conjugate state ( solid line ) down . at small interior overlaps , this shifts the two level crossings ( initially at @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) outwards towards a flux of zero and one flux quantum @xmath88 .",
    "note that the level crossings remain intact , protected by fermion parity conservation .",
    "however , once the level crossings reach a flux of zero and @xmath88 , respectively , the levels merely touch at these points .",
    "thus , fermion parity no longer protects the levels from splitting , and indeed one state remains at finite and negative energies at all values of flux while , symmetrically , its particle - hole conjugate state remains at finite and positive energies .",
    "consider now the josephson current as function of flux in the presence of weak but finite fermion parity violating processes .",
    "specifically , we assume that the flux is varied by @xmath1 on a time scale which is large compared to the relaxation time of the fermion parity while at the same time , the fermion parity violating processes are weak compared to the hybridization of the majorana bound states so that the bogoliubov - de gennes spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig : flux ] are relevant . in this case , the josephson current is essentially @xmath2 periodic deep in the topological phase , where @xmath89 . however , as the system approaches the topological phase transition , @xmath34 grows and hence , the hybridization of the majorana bound states through the interior of the ring increases . as a result , the @xmath1-periodic contribution to the current increases .",
    "conversely , the majorana bound states disappear on the nontopological side of the phase transition where the josephson current thus reverts to @xmath2 periodicity . as a result , we expect a _ peak _ in the @xmath1-periodic josephson current near the topological phase transition , whose measurement would constitute a clear signature of the topological phase transition and the formation of majorana fermions .",

    "approaching the phase transition at @xmath8 , the mbs delocalize . on the one hand , this causes an increase in the overlap of the mbs in the interior of the topological superconductor .",
    "as discussed above , this leads to an increase of the @xmath1-periodic josephson current . on the other hand , however , the probability density of the majorana bound state near the weak link decreases , causing a suppression of the hybridization of the majorana bound states across the weak link and hence of the @xmath1-periodic josephson current .",

    "<S> in large rings , the majorana fermions hybridize only across the weak link . in this case , the josephson current is @xmath1 periodic in the flux threading the loop when fermion parity is a good quantum number but reverts to the more conventional @xmath2 periodicity in the presence of fermion - parity changing relaxation processes . in mesoscopic rings , the majorana fermions also hybridize through their overlap in the interior of the superconducting ring . </S>",
    "<S> we find that in the topological superconducting phase , this gives rise to an @xmath1-periodic contribution even when fermion parity is not conserved and that this contribution exhibits a peak near the topological phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> this signature of the topological phase transition is robust to the effects of disorder . as a byproduct , </S>",
    "<S> we find that close to the topological phase transition , disorder drives the system deeper into the topological phase . </S>",
    "<S> this is in stark contrast to the known behavior far from the phase transition , where disorder tends to suppress the topological phase . </S>"
