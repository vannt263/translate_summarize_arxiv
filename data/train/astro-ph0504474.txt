    "the young , massive stars are mainly concentrated in the region @xmath010@xmath4 in projection around sgr  a * and appear to rotate around sgr  a * in two counter - rotating disks that contain an apparently coeval population of wolf - rayet ( wr ) , luminous blue variables ( lbv ) , and o / b - stars ( * ? ? ?",

    "the irs  13e complex is a very intriguing object .",
    "located @xmath5 in projection from sgr  a * , it comprises almost half a dozen massive stars within a projected radius of @xmath00.25@xmath4 .",
    "these stars appear to be wr stars or o - type supergiants .",
    "in addition to representing an unusual concentration of bright , early - type stars , the irs  13e sources also have very similar proper motions ( see , e.g. , fig .  18 in * ? ? ? * ) . suggested that the irs  13e complex is the remnant core of a massive star cluster that had fallen into the central parsec and dissolved there .",
    "their main arguments are a ) the similar proper motions of the irs  13e cluster members and b ) their finding that the stars in irs  13e appear to be massive , short - lived , and therefore young .",
    "since one would expect that an association of stars such as irs  13e should be disrupted by the tidal field of sgr  a * , they speculated that an intermediate - mass black hole ( imbh ) in irs  13e may prevent its disruption .",
    "an imbh in the core of an infalling cluster would also provide an effective means of inward transportation through increased dynamical friction as has been suggested by @xcite ( see , however , * ? ? ?",
    "the possible existence of an imbh in the gc is currently a hypothesis of high interest in the field",
    ". therefore we consider it timely to present the newest data on stellar dynamics in irs  13e . in this letter , we analyze proper motions of the stars in and near the irs  13e complex , derived from ten years of near - infrared ( nir ) speckle and ao observations of the gc stellar cluster .",
    "observations of the gc stellar cluster are routinely performed since spring 2002 with the conica / naos nir camera / adaptive optics ( ao ) system at the eso vlt unit telescope  4 on cerro paranal in chile . for this work ,",
    "we used k - band ( and some h - band ) imaging data .",
    "after standard data reduction ( sky subtraction , dead pixel correction , flat fielding , shift - and - add ) the final images were lucy - richardson ( lr ) deconvolved and beam restored with a gaussian beam of @xmath060mas ( 40mas for h - band images , respectively ) , corresponding to the diffraction limit of the vlt at @xmath6 m .",
    "stellar positions were extracted with _",
    "starfinder _ .",
    "they were transformed into a coordinate system relative to sgr  a * with the aid of 18  reference stars with well known positions and proper motions , taken from @xcite .",
    "each of the data sets was divided into two parts that were reduced and analyzed independently .",
    "uncertainties of the source positions were thus obtained by a comparison of two independent measurements for each epoch .",
    "we added to these data gemini north ao h and k imaging data from july 2000 .",
    "the images are part of the gemini north galactic center demonstration science data set .",
    "both images were lr deconvolved and beam restored .",
    "source positions were extracted in the way described above ( using the two independent measurements provided by the h and k images ) . in order to obtain a larger time baseline",
    ", we also used sharp speckle imaging data from july 1995 , june 1996 , and june 2001 .",
    "details on the observation and reduction of sharp imaging data may be found , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "again , we applied lr deconvolution and used two independent data sets for each epoch .",
    "the irs  13e sources are named in fig.[fig : propmot ] .",
    "@xcite label e3 and e4 as e3c and e3n , respectively . noted that e3 is a multiple source and named the two components e3a and e3b . on the image presented here",
    ", e3 appears to have more than two components .",
    "we just label the brightest one of them e3 ( the image in fig .",
    "[ fig : propmot ] is based on data with a strehl @xmath7 in contrast to the gemini image of strehl @xmath05% used by ) . as concerns e5",
    ", it appears highly confused with other sources and/or extended .",
    "proper motions of the stars were determined by linear fits to the measured time - dependent positions with their respective uncertainties ( adopting a gc distance of 7.9  kpc from * ? ? ? * ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : propmot ] , the derived proper motions of all stars in and near irs  13e are shown superposed on an image .",
    "the common proper motion of the irs  13e cluster members stands out clearly .",
    "we identify five stars within a region of about @xmath8 diameter that could be part of irs  13e ( see also table  [ tab : vels ] ) .",
    "there may be further potential members , but they are either too weak , embedded in extended emission , or too close to brighter stars , such that no reliable proper motions could be determined . the proper motion of e6 ,",
    "while pointing into the same direction as the ones of the other irs  13e sources , is significantly smaller in magnitude .",
    "also , note that e6 is extincted much less than the other irs  13e stars .",
    "it is therefore questionable whether e6 forms part of irs  13e and we omit it from the following analysis . the proper motion of e5 could not be reliably determined .",
    "considered that irs  13e might be bound by an imbh . from spectroscopically",
    "estimated radial velocities for e2 and e4 and assuming that the hypothetical imbh is located halfway between the two stars , they estimated its mass to @xmath01000m@xmath2 . with the proper motions , we can derive the minimum mass that is required to bind the irs  13e cluster members . here , it is first necessary to subtract the systemic motion of irs  13e . subsequently , the residual velocities of the individual sources can be used for estimating the mass in irs  13e under the assumption that it is a gravitationally bound system . since we can not know the true systemic velocity , we examined three cases : a ) using the average proper motion of the ensemble , b ) using the proper motion of e1 , and c ) using the proper motion of e4 . thus , all realistic cases , even extreme ones , should be covered . in the following ,",
    "we limit our analysis to case a ) , which is the most conservative one because it results in the lowest enclosed masses . the average proper motion of irs  13e , derived from the mean of the velocities of sources e1 , e2 , e3 , and e4 , is @xmath9kms@xmath10 westwards and @xmath11kms@xmath10 northwards . here , we chose an unweighted average because we can not know which one of the individual proper motions corresponds best to the possible systemic velocity .",
    "the proper motions of the irs  13e sources after subtraction of a systemic velocity corresponding to their mean motion are shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : masses ] .",
    "a first rough estimate of the mass needed to bind irs 13e can be obtained from the residual velocities , through @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the gravitational constant and @xmath14mpc the size of the system . with @xmath15kms@xmath10(@xmath16kms@xmath10 ) we obtain @xmath17m@xmath2(@xmath18m@xmath2 ) .",
    "we chose two more refined approaches to estimating the mass of a putative imbh that gravitationally binds irs  13e : a ) estimating the mass in irs  13e with the leonard - merritt ( lm ) mass estimator ( eq .  19 in * ? ? ? * ) and b ) deriving a lower limit on the mass through the relation @xmath19 , with @xmath20 being the projected distance of a star from the imbh , @xmath21 its velocity projected onto the plane of the sky , @xmath22 its real distance from the imbh , @xmath23 its escape velocity , @xmath13 the gravitational constant , and @xmath24 the mass of the imbh .    taking into account the unknown location of the black hole",
    ", we examined a field of @xmath25 in right ascension and declination around the center of irs  13e with a grid step of @xmath26 .",
    "the residual proper motion of each star results in a required lower mass for the imbh ",
    "dependent on its location  in order to bind the star to irs  13e .",
    "thus , one can obtain four maps for the sources e1 , e2 , e3 , and e4 .",
    "the four maps were combined by taking the maximum ( otherwise the system would not be bound ) of the calculated mass limits at a given location .",
    "we show the resulting map of lower mass limits in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : masses ] .",
    "the significance of the calculated masses over the field is @xmath27@xmath28 .",
    "since e1 has the proper motion with the strongest deviation from the mean proper motion of the ensemble , it is the star that gives the strongest constraints . there is a narrow minimum in the mass map for black hole locations close to e1 ( @xmath00.1@xmath4 nw of e1 ) .",
    "in this most conservative case , the mass of the black hole would have to be larger than @xmath29m@xmath2  ( with a significance of 4@xmath28 ) .",
    "if the black hole were located between e2 and e4 , the location used by for their mass estimate , it would have to have a mass @xmath30m@xmath2  ( significance @xmath31 ) .",
    "these are only lower limits that rely on projected velocities and conservative estimates .",
    "if irs  13e is indeed a bound system , a more realistic mass might be derived with the lm estimator .",
    "again , there is a minimum near e1 for the black hole mass .",
    "however , even in this conservative case , the lm estimator gives a mass of @xmath050000@xmath32m@xmath2 .",
    "if we include the source e6 in the above described analysis , the required black hole masses would at least double , due to the increased velocity gradient across the complex .",
    "hence , we conclude that it is safe to assume that the required mass to bind the members of the irs  13e complex must be at least @xmath33m@xmath2 . assuming the extreme case that the 4 brightest stars in irs  13e are similarly massive as the binary irs  16sw ( @xmath34100m@xmath2 , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it appears conservative to assume that the stellar mass in irs  13e does not exceed @xmath35m@xmath2  and can thus be neglected in this analysis .",
    "irs  13e is located at a projected distance of @xmath0@xmath36 or @xmath0130mpc from the @xmath37m@xmath2   black hole sgr  a*. it may be associated with the counter - rotating disk of young stars @xcite . in this case , it should be located at @xmath0120mpc behind the plane of the sky . with a radius of @xmath0@xmath38 , a mass of roughly 1000m@xmath2   then would be sufficient to protect the system from tidal disruption . however , as the analysis above shows , the real constraints for binding irs  13e gravitationally result from the intrinsic proper motions of the sources in this complex .",
    "we took into account the unknown location of the hypothetical black hole and various possibilities for the systemic motion of irs  13e in the gravitational potential of sgr  a*. in the most conservative case , the minimum mass to bind irs  13e was found to be @xmath39m@xmath2  ( with a significance of 4@xmath28 ) .",
    "this would confine the imbh to a narrow region @xmath40 nw of e1 . outside this region",
    "the required mass is greater than @xmath41m@xmath2 . the lm mass estimator results in even higher masses .",
    "it is generally accepted that accreting black holes are associated with non - thermal radio and x - ray emission .",
    "one may argue that an imbh in irs  13e could be `` starved '' , similar to sgr  a * , with its emission below the detection limit of current telescopes .",
    "however , there are several pieces of evidence that the irs  13e cluster is closely associated with the gas and dust of the mini - spiral : first , there is the close spatial relation between irs  13e and emission from warm dust ( see , e.g. , the high - resolution ao 3.8@xmath42 m images in * ? ? ?",
    "present an analysis of the mini - spiral that also supports a close relation between irs  13e and the ism .",
    "also , the stars in irs  13e , with some of them being wr stars , may present favorable sources of gas and dust . and @xcite present spectroscopic evidence for absorption / emission due to gas and dust intrinsic to irs  13e and for interaction between winds from irs  13e and the surrounding ism .",
    "hence , the situation for a hypothetical black hole in irs  13e appears to be different from sgr  a * , with plenty of material available for accretion .    as for mm / radio emission , @xcite",
    "show that the 13 mm point source observed by @xcite in the irs  13e cluster is most likely due to thermal emission from the 4@xmath42m - excess source e3c in the center of irs  13e , a dusty wr star ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the two components e3a and e3b are also proposed as dusty wr stars in the analysis by . as for x - ray emission , @xcite report an x - ray source that they associate with irs  13e",
    ". using the position of this source and of sgr  a * as listed in their table  1 , we located this x - ray source in the nir reference frame .",
    "its position is marked with a 1@xmath28 error box in fig .",
    "[ fig : propmot ] .",
    "the x - ray source appears offset from irs  13e as also discussed by .",
    "interpret the spectrum of the source as consistent with that of a post - lbv wr colliding wind binary ( although none of the bright irs  13e members appears to be associated with the source , see fig .  [",
    "fig : propmot ] ) .",
    "as for a very recent analysis of this x - ray source , it appears to be located a few @xmath43 further north than indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : propmot ] , so that e5 lies within the positional uncertainty .",
    "no variability of the source was found and it appears to be explained well by colliding winds ( f. baganoff , priv .",
    ". therefore there appears to be no compelling evidence for an accreting imbh in irs  13e .",
    "furthermore , spectroscopy at 4@xmath42 m and 5@xmath42 m @xcite does not reveal any strong broad lines or emission from highly excited ions as they might be expected near an accreting black hole .",
    "infall and dissolution of a massive cluster into the central parsec seems an attractive hypothesis for delivering young stars to the region near sgr  a*. generally , the conditions required for a cluster to form near the gc and to fall in towards the central parsec to deposit young , massive stars there within their lifetime , are extreme , i.e. , high core densities and large cluster masses .",
    "an imbh in the core of such a cluster was suggested by @xcite as a means of increasing the efficiency of dynamical friction on the cluster , and thus to relax somewhat the demands on its total mass and core density .",
    "@xcite , however , conclude that an imbh in the cluster core must comprise an unrealistic @xmath010% of the total cluster mass in order for this mechanism to be effective .    from the proper motions presented here ,",
    "the required minimum mass for a hypothetical imbh in order to bind the members of irs  13e was derived to be @xmath44m@xmath2 . @xcite",
    "analyze the growth of an imbh by runaway collisions in a dense stellar cluster and conclude that such an object may form in dense clusters and contain of the order @xmath45 of the total stellar mass .",
    "given the high mass estimate for an imbh in irs  13e derived in this work , this would mean an unrealistically high mass of @xmath46m@xmath2   for the progenitor cluster . in this context",
    "it is also important to point out the results of @xcite that exclude the existence of a secondary black hole with masses @xmath44m@xmath2   and semi - major axes between @xmath35 and @xmath47au ( corresponding to @xmath00.1@xmath4 to 12.5@xmath4 angular distance from sgr  a * ) .",
    "we can not yet exclude an imbh of up to a few thousand solar masses in irs  13e , but our results suggest that in this case irs  13e must be in the process of dissolution . in this context , we would like to point out the recent work by levin , wu and thommes ( astro - ph/0502143 ) .",
    "they have simulated the infall and dissolution of a stellar cluster with an imbh in the gc and concluded that a hypothetical imbh that binds the irs  13e complex could not have delivered all of the young stars in the gc to their present location .",
    "the positions and proper motions of the irs  13e stars are consistent with their being part of the counter - clockwise disk / ring of young stars ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also t.  paumard et al .",
    ", 2005 , in preparation ) . as for the unusual clustering of the stars in irs  13e , the complex may be , on the one hand , a ( quasi-)permanent feature , i.e. gravitationally bound by a hypothetical imbh .",
    "our analysis shows that in this case , if the star e1 is indeed part of the complex , the imbh would have to be unsually massive .",
    "this makes its existence questionable because of the required large mass of the progenitor cluster and because of the lack of a clear identification of a non - thermal , variable x - ray source centered within irs  13e .",
    "however , we can not completely discard the imbh hypothesis .",
    "on the other hand , irs  13e may be a temporary feature , i.e. , either a chance association ( which is appears somewhat unlikely , even if the stars are part of a disk / ring ) or a cluster in the process of dissolution . at this point",
