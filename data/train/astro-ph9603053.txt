    "what physical processes are responsible for the observed alignment of interstellar dust grains ?",
    "the answer to this question has proved remarkably elusive .",
    "the first major theoretical assault on this problem was the classic paper by davis & greenstein ( 1951 ) , who examined many of the physical processes involved , and proposed that grain alignment was the result of magnetic dissipation within spinning grains . while other alignment mechanisms are possible  in particular , alignment by gas - grain streaming ( gold 1952 ; roberge & hanany 1990 ; lazarian 1994 )  the process of grain alignment by magnetic dissipation has continued to appear attractive , and has received continuing theoretical attention .",
    "in this paper i review some optical and magnetic properties of grains , as they relate to the problem of grain alignment .",
    "there is little we can say for certain about the composition , sizes , and geometry of interstellar grains ; our current state of understanding is summarized in   [ sec : graincomp],[sec : graingeom ] at first sight it is not apparent how the optical properties can affect grain alignment ; in  [ sec : radtorq ] a mechanism is discussed whereby radiation field anisotropy can result in substantial torques on interstellar grains .",
    "these radiative torques may produce both suprathermal rotation and grain alignment .",
    "the efficacy of grain alignment by magnetic dissipation obviously depends on the magnetic properties of dust grains , reviewed in  [ sec : magprop ] since we do not know what grains are composed of , their magnetic properties are necessarily uncertain ; various possibilities are discussed .",
    "`` ordinary '' paramagnetism appears to be marginally capable of producing grain alignment in suprathermally rotating grains .",
    "it seems quite possible , however , that at least some interstellar grains may contain ferromagnetic inclusions , which can enhance the rate of magnetic dissipation either by `` superparamagnetism '' or by subjecting adjacent paramagnetic material to a static magnetic field .",
    "spectroscopy of interstellar dust began with the discovery by merrill ( 1934 ) that 4 diffuse bands were of interstellar origin .",
    "it is humbling to realize that over 60 years later  and 30 years after dust grain spectroscopy was extended to the ultraviolet and infrared  we still do not have _ any _ certain identification of interstellar grain composition .",
    "observations and theories of interstellar dust have been reviewed recently by various authors ( mathis 1993 ; draine 1994 , 1995 ) . elsewhere in this volume ,",
    "mathis ( 1996 ) gives an excellent summary of observational constraints on dust models , stressing how little we can say with confidence concerning grain composition . i would summarize our knowledge of the composition of grains in diffuse clouds as follows :    * the 9.7@xmath0 and 18@xmath0 features almost certainly require that a substantial fraction ( @xmath1 ) is in some form(s ) of silicate material .",
    "probably this material contains most of the mg , si , and fe in the interstellar medium , and perhaps 1020% of the o. * the strong 2175@xmath2 `` bump '' is very likely to be due to some form of carbon in @xmath3 grains ( draine 1989 ) . the carbon material is likely to be graphitic in nature ( i.e. , primarily @xmath4 bonding ) .",
    "approximately 14% of the interstellar carbon must be in this form * the 3.4@xmath0 c - h stretch indicates that some form of aliphatic hydrocarbon is present .",
    "* meteoritic studies tell us that diamond , sic , tic , and al@xmath5o@xmath6 are present in interstellar space at some ( unknown ) low level .    beyond this",
    ", we can say little about the composition of grains in diffuse clouds .",
    "spectroscopy of dust in dark clouds reveals a host of additional condensed species such as h@xmath5o , co , and ch@xmath6oh ( cf .",
    "van dishoeck et al .",
    "1993 , table viii ) , but grains in diffuse clouds appear to be devoid of these `` ice '' features .",
    "the overall wavelength - dependence of interstellar extinction and polarization allows some general conclusions regarding the size distribution of interstellar dust :    * the grain size distribution must include grains as large as @xmath7 and as small as @xmath8 . *",
    "the size distribution may be approximated by the `` mrn distribution '' , @xmath9 ( mathis , rumpl , & nordsieck 1977 ; kim , martin , & hendry 1994 ) , with most of the volume contributed by the large particles , and most of the surface area contributed by small particles * the observed wavelength - dependent polarization indicates that the larger particles ( @xmath10 are both nonspherical and fairly well aligned , but the smaller particles ( @xmath11 ) are either spherical or poorly aligned ( kim & martin 1995 ) .",
    "the optical properties of grains depend on geometry as well as composition ; unfortunately , the likely grain geometry is controversial . the mrn model ( mathis , rumpl , & nordsieck 1977 ;",
    "draine & lee 1984 ) approximates the grains as solid spheres .",
    "the observed interstellar polarization of course indicates that the grains can not all be spherical , but the optical properties of spheroids ( with moderate axial ratio ) are not greatly different from those of spheres , and spheroids can reproduce the observed polarization ( kim & martin 1995 ) .",
    "mathis & whiffen ( 1989 ) , however , favor the idea that at least the @xmath12 grains are fluffy aggregates of smaller particles . in any case",
    ", we can be certain that nature has _ not _ populated the ism with spheres or spheroids  the complex evolution of interstellar grains ( draine 1990 ; dorschner & henning 1996 ) seems guaranteed to produce irregular structures , whether `` fluffy '' or not .",
    "purcell ( 1979 ) pointed out 3 separate processes which may result in suprathermal grain rotation : inelastic scattering of impinging atoms when the gas and grain temperature differ , photoelectric emission , and @xmath13 formation on grain surfaces . here",
    "we call attention to a new mechanism which may produce suprathermal rotation of interstellar grains : radiative torques on grains illuminated by anisotropic starlight .",
    "the possibility of spinning up grains by illuminating them with anisotropic radiation was considered by harwit ( 1970a , b ) , who noted that if a grain illuminated by a point source absorbed different numbers of left- and right - circularly - polarized photons , it would acquire a net angular momentum parallel or antiparallel to the photon s direction of propagation .",
    "harwit considered symmetric grains , and estimated the rms value of the grain angular momentum resulting from the stochastic nature of photon absorption .",
    "purcell & spitzer ( 1971 ) showed , however , that this angular momentum is small compared to that resulting from the radiation - pressure - driven gas - grain streaming    dolginov ( 1972 ) and dolginov & mytrophanov ( 1976 ) pointed out that a typical interstellar grain may possess a certain amount of `` helicity '' if it is made of optically - active material , or simply has an irregular shape , so that the scattering and absorption cross sections will differ for the two circular polarization states . as a result ,",
    "if the grain is subject to an unpolarized but anisotropic radiation field , there will be a systematic torque .    while in principle such `` helicity '' should exist , it has not been apparent how effective it will be in producing torques on interstellar grains , because of the difficulty in calculating electromagnetic cross sections for irregular grains .",
    "this has recently been investigated by draine & weingartner ( 1996 ) , using the discrete dipole approximation ( draine & flatau 1994 ) to calculate the torques on grains illuminated by a beam of unpolarized radiation .",
    "they considered a moderately irregular grain , which does not appear  to the eye  to be obviously `` helical '' .",
    "their results indicate that , at least for this grain , a typical radiation field in a diffuse cloud will torque the grain up to suprathermal rotation velocities .    as noted by purcell ( 1979 ) ,",
    "if suprathermal grain rotation can be maintained by `` thrusters '' which are fixed relative to the grain surface ( e.g. , preferred sites for @xmath13 formation ) , then davis - greenstein alignment will occur inexorably .",
    "if the `` thrusters '' on the grain surface are stable for periods long compared to @xmath14 , then high degrees of grain alignment will result .",
    "the problem with this explanation for observed grain alignment is that it seems questionable whether the grain surface properties responsible for the suprathermal rotation remain stable for the millions of years necessary for grain alignment by normal paramagnetic dissipation .",
    "the radiative torque driving suprathermal rotation is , however , determined by the overall grain `` helicity '' , and one expects this helicity to have a lifetime comparable to the @xmath15 lifetime of a refractory grain ( draine & salpeter 1979 ; jones et al .",
    "1994 )  much longer than the timescale for altering the monolayer or so of atoms determining the surface properties .",
    "there is a preferred direction in the problem : that characterizing the anisotropy in the radiation field ; this may be the direction to the galactic center ( _ very _ stable ! ) or the nearest bright stellar association ( probably stable for @xmath16 ) . as a result , suprathermal rotation driven by radiative torques may result in appreciable degrees of grain alignment even if grains have only ordinary paramagnetic properties .",
    "it is also important to note that the torque on the grain depends on the grain orientation relative to the radiation anisotropy , so that the radiative torques can actually play a direct role in the grain alignment process .",
    "finally , the existence of a new mechanism for driving suprathermal rotation of course does not mean that the previously - proposed mechanisms ( @xmath13 recombination , variations in accomodation coefficient , photoelectric emission ) cease to operate : the dynamics of the grain will be determined by all of these acting in concert .",
    "interstellar grains rotate rapidly ; if the grain spin axis is not aligned with the external field @xmath20 , then the component of @xmath20 transverse to the spin axis will appear ( in the `` grain frame '' ) to be rotating with a frequency equal to the grain rotational velocity @xmath19 .",
    "the angular velocity for a sphere is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the rotational kinetic energy .",
    "`` thermal '' rotation would have @xmath28 , but various effects are expected to result in much larger `` suprathermal '' rotation rates ( purcell 1979 ) . we therefore need to understand the response of materials to magnetic fields at frequencies @xmath29 .",
    "most materials contain unpaired electrons in partially - filled shells [ see morrish ( 1980 ) for a general introduction to magnetism ] .",
    "let @xmath30 be the magnetic moment of the electrons in the outer , partially - filled shell , where @xmath31 is the bohr magneton .",
    "fe@xmath32 and fe@xmath33 ions have @xmath34 and 5.9 , respectively ( morrish 1980 ) . in numerical examples below we will take @xmath35 .",
    "let the number density of `` paramagnetic '' atoms with partially - filled shells be @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the total atomic density , and @xmath38 is the fraction of the atoms which are paramagnetic . since observations of interstellar depletions indicate that @xmath39 of the atoms in grains are fe , it will be reasonable to consider values of @xmath38 as large as @xmath40 .",
    "if the exchange interaction and interactions among the spins do not induce long - range order , then the spin system will be paramagnetic . for a static field",
    "the paramagnetic susceptibility is given by curie s law ( morrish 1980 ) : @xmath41 @xmath42 must satisfy the kramers - kronig relation ( landau & lifshitz 1960 ) @xmath43 since @xmath44 is known , this strongly constrains @xmath42  its integral over frequency is fixed .",
    "there are _ two _ distinct relaxation processes  spin - spin relaxation and spin - lattice relaxation  but jones & spitzer ( 1967 ) showed that only spin - spin relaxation is relevant for paramagnetic grains spinning in a weak magnetic field .",
    "each magnetic moment is subject to strong `` internal '' magnetic fields produced by the other magnetic moments , with rms value @xmath56 ( van vleck 1937 ) .",
    "the spin - spin coupling time @xmath57 should be approximately equal to the inverse of the precession frequency in a field @xmath58 , @xmath59 where we have taken @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "this is a factor @xmath62 larger than the theoretical estimate of broer ( 1943 ) , but appears to be in fairly good agreement with the experimental results given by morrish ( 1980 , table 3 - 6.1 ) . with this value of @xmath57",
    "we obtain @xmath63 this is @xmath64 smaller than the estimates of jone & spitzer ( 1967 ) and spitzer ( 1978 ) , reflecting uncertainties in estimation of @xmath57 and the form of the function @xmath42 . in figure 1",
    "we plot @xmath42 as a function of grain rotation frequency for different values of @xmath38 .",
    "we note that some fe - rich minerals are antiferromagnetic : below the nel temperature @xmath65 , the magnetic moments are ordered but in such a way that the net magnetization is zero . at @xmath66 , the material behaves approximately like an ordinary paramagnetic substance , but for @xmath67 the susceptibility is below the value expected from eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi0 ] ) .",
    "examples of potential interest include troilite ( fes , @xmath68 ; carmichael 1989 ) , wustite ( feo , @xmath69 ; carmichael 1989 ) , fayalite ( fe@xmath5sio@xmath70 , @xmath71 ; strangway 1981 ) , and pyroxene ( fesio@xmath6 , @xmath72 ; carmichael 1989 ) . at the temperatures @xmath73 of interstellar grains , macroscopic crystals of these materials would have very small susceptibilities [ e.g.",
    ", fe@xmath5sio@xmath70 has @xmath74 at @xmath75 ( santoro , newnham & nomura 1966 ) , a factor @xmath76 below what would have been estimated from eq.([eq : chi0 ] ) ] .",
    "we note , however , that interstellar grains are ( a ) unlikely to be crystalline ( or will have extremely small microcrystallites ) and ( b ) are unlikely to be strictly stochiometric . as a result ,",
    "ideal antiferromagnetism is unlikely to occur : there should always be a reasonable number of uncompensated magnetic ions .",
    "indeed , although nio is antiferromagnetic for @xmath77 , weak ferromagnetism has been observed in small ( @xmath78 ) particles ( richardson & milligan 1956 ; schuele & deetscreek 1962 ) .",
    "we therefore expect fe - containing interstellar grains to be either paramagnetic , superparamagnetic , ferrimagnetic , or ferromagnetic .",
    "as originally proposed by jones & spitzer ( 1967 ) , interstellar grains may contain `` superparamagnetic '' inclusions , in which a cluster of atoms spontaneously magnetizes into a single domain , behaving like a single large magnetic moment .",
    "this can occur for clusters of materials which are ferromagnetic ( e.g. , fe ) or ferrimagnetic , such as magnetite ( fe@xmath6o@xmath70 ) or maghemite ( @xmath79fe@xmath5o@xmath6 ) .",
    "we see from figure 2 that if 1% of the atoms in the grain are fe atoms in clusters and the grain rotational velocity is approximately `` thermal '' ( @xmath95 ) , then @xmath96 provided the clusters are not too large , @xmath97 ; this corresponds to cluster diameters @xmath98 .",
    "_ very _ large values of @xmath42 are possible for @xmath99 : a _ single _ cluster of @xmath100 fe atoms would give a grain an effective @xmath101 .    on the other hand , if the grain is very small , or if the grain rotational velocity is highly suprathermal , only small clusters will be able to provide appreciable superparamagnetic damping : e.g. , if @xmath102 , then only clusters with @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) will be effective .",
    "how likely is it that interstellar grains will contain clusters of @xmath105 fe atoms , with diameters @xmath106 ?",
    "it is difficult to say , but martin ( 1995 ) has observed that the interplanetary dust particles referred to as gems ( glasses with embedded metals and sulfides ; bradley 1994 ) , which may well be of interstellar origin , do contain small metal - rich inclusions , possibly superparamagnetic ; this idea has been further stressed by goodman & whittet ( 1996 ) .",
    "mathis ( 1986 ) proposed that the observed variation of degree of grain alignment with grain size could be understood as reflecting the probability of one or more superparamagnetic inclusions being present in a grain ; in mathis s model , a grain of radius @xmath107 has a @xmath10850% probability of containing one or more superparamagnetic inclusions .",
    "the idea of grain alignment being due to superparamagnetic inclusion is quite attractive : it is physically plausible , and it provides a `` natural '' explanation for the observed wavelength - dependence of polarization . if gems are found to be of interstellar origin , laboratory studies of the magnetic properties of their inclusions will permit this hypothesis to be tested .",
    "duley ( 1978 ) pointed out that if interstellar grains contain ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic inclusions , then these inclusions will subject nearby paramagnetic material to a constant magnetic field ; the presence of this field can substantially increase the dissipation provided by the paramagnetic substance , thereby enhancing the grain alignment process .",
    "if a fraction @xmath118 of the atoms are in single - domain ferromagnetic clusters , then the rms value of the resulting magnetic field component along a given direction outside the clusters will be @xmath119 in figure 3 we show the magnetic susceptibility computed for the paramagnetic grain material ( with @xmath94 ) ; curves are labelled by the fraction @xmath118 of the atoms assumed to be in ferromagnetic clusters .",
    "we see that for @xmath120 and @xmath121 , @xmath42 can be substantially larger than the estimate ( [ eq : k ] ) based on spin - spin dissipation only .",
    "( we note , however , that this enhancement is quite sensitive to the very uncertain value of @xmath111 . ) because @xmath122 is fixed , the enhancement of @xmath42 at low frequencies is accompanied by a suppression of @xmath42 at high frequencies @xmath123 .      because of the barnett effect ( landau & lifshitz 1960 )",
    ", a spinning grain will spontaneously develop a magnetization proportional to @xmath19 : @xmath124 just as though it were at rest and subject to a magnetic field equal to the `` barnett equivalent '' field @xmath125 the fictitious field @xmath126 is antiparallel to @xmath127 .",
    "the resulting magnetic moment will cause the grain to precess in the galactic magnetic field ( dolginov & mytrophanov 1976 ) .",
    "if the grain angular momentum @xmath128 is not parallel to a principal axis of the moment of inertia tensor , @xmath127 will be time - dependent ; purcell ( 1979 ) noted that there must be resulting dissipation due to the barnett effect , as the result of which the grain s principal axis of largest moment of inertia must align with the grain angular momentum .    because @xmath129 , the barnett effect is not expected to strongly affect the time - dependent magnetization ( in the `` grain frame '' ) due to the `` oscillating '' component of the galactic magnetic field perpendicular to @xmath127 : the effects are expected to be small provided @xmath130",
    "is small compared to the internal field @xmath131 .",
    "thus while the barnett effect is important for alignment of the grain s principal axis with @xmath128 , and precession of @xmath128 around the galactic magnetic field , it is not expected to significantly affect the rate of alignment of @xmath128 with the galactic magnetic field .",
    "the following are the principal conclusions of this review :    * irregular grains are subject to radiative torques when illuminated by anisotropic starlight .",
    "these torques are likely to result in suprathermal rotation , and to play an active role in the grain alignment process .",
    "* the magnetic properties of grains remain very uncertain .",
    "normal paramagnetism by itself can bring about grain alignment if steady suprathermal rotation can be maintained for long periods . *",
    "the fe content of interstellar grains is so high that at least part of the grain volume should be ferrimagnetic or ferromagnetic . * if the ferri- or ferromagnetic inclusions are not too large , they will be superparamagnetic , and can greatly enhance the rate of grain alignment by magnetic dissipation .",
    "fe clusters with diameter @xmath132 will be effective . *",
    "even if too large to be superparamagnetic , ferri- or ferromagnetic inclusions in grains may possibly enhance the rate of dissipation in surrounding paramagnetic material .",
