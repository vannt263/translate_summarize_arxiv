    "the galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) is a fundamental tool to study the formation and evolution of galaxies as the shape of the lf is mainly determined by the mechanisms that regulate the star formation in galaxies @xcite . comparing",
    "the lf with the underlying dark matter halo mass function reveals the importance of different modes of feedback in galaxy formation , with the active galactic nuclei feedback dominating the bright end and supernova and radiation - driven winds dominating the faint end ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , the lf is a key probe to assess the contribution of galaxies with different luminosities to the total light budget at different redshifts .",
    "as ultraviolet ( uv ) light is a tracer of recent star formation in galaxies , the uv lf can help determine the total star formation rate density at all epochs .",
    "in addition , the uv lf is one of the few galaxy observables which is directly measurable at all epochs using current telescopes . over the past 20 years",
    ", many studies have been devoted to uv lf measurements at high redshifts with @xmath20 @xcite , intermediate redshifts with @xmath0 @xcite including our previous work ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter a14 ) , as well as low redshifts with @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "taken together , these measurements suggest a rise and fall in the history of cosmic star formation from high redshifts to the present time with a peak sometime between @xmath0 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "therefore the redshift range of @xmath0 , known as the peak epoch of cosmic star formation , is a critical time in galaxy evolution .",
    "many wide and shallow surveys have probed the uv lf of rarer , luminous galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite used the wfpc2 data in the hdf - north and hdf - south and measured a faint - end slope of @xmath22 for the uv lf at @xmath23 .",
    "later , @xcite used a wide ground - based survey covering luminosities with @xmath24 , i.e. @xmath25 , from @xcite . ] and measured a steep faint - end slope of @xmath26 at @xmath27 .",
    "following the installation of wfc3 on the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) , @xcite used the wide , shallow early release survey ( ers ; * ? ? ? * ) and measured steep faint - end slopes ( @xmath28 ) for the uv lfs at @xmath29 .",
    "however , in order to study the uv lf at fainter luminosities and accurately quantify the faint - end slope , deeper surveys were needed . in a14 ( see next paragraph for more details ) , we used a very deep uv observation of the abell 1689 ( hereafter a1689 ) cluster obtained with the wfc3/uvis channel and we extended the @xmath30 uv lf @xmath31 fainter than previous shallower surveys ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "we concluded that the uv lf has a steep faint - end slope of @xmath33 with no evidence of a turnover down to @xmath34 .",
    "@xcite recently found galaxies as faint as @xmath35 utilizing the candels / goods - south , ultravista / cosmos and hudf data .",
    "however , their estimate of the faint - end slope @xmath36 is significantly shallower than others .",
    "a shortcoming of these two deep surveys is that they probe a single field ( a1689 in a14 and hudf dominating the faint luminosities in @xcite ) , where the field - to - field variations affect the lf measurements . in this paper",
    ", we attempt to overcome this problem by combining deep observations of three lines of sight .",
    "faint star - forming galaxies play a critical role in galaxy formation and evolution , because they significantly contribute to igm metal enrichment @xcite , are the most plausible sources of ionizing photons during the reionization epoch @xcite and maintain the ionizing background at @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "however , these faint galaxies are inaccessible at high redshifts as they lay outside of the detection limits of current surveys .",
    "one powerful way to explore these faint galaxies , is to exploit the magnification of strong gravitational lensing offered by foreground massive systems and thus push the detection limits to lower luminosities .",
    "there have been many studies of high redshift galaxies lensed by individual galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , galaxy clusters acting as gravitational lenses can magnify a large area ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , allowing a study of many highly magnified galaxies in a single pointing . in a14 , combining our deep observations and magnification from strong gravitational lensing from a1689 enabled us to identify background ultra - faint galaxies .",
    "this technique of targeting lensing galaxy clusters has been extensively used since the discovery of the first gravitationally lensed arc in the abell 370 cluster @xcite , and has culminated with recent large surveys of lensing clusters such as the clash @xcite and hubble frontier field ( hff ) @xcite surveys .",
    "the hff program obtains very deep optical and near - infrared imaging over six lensing clusters using _ hst_/acs and _ hst_/wfc3 , respectively .",
    "these deep images enable a search for the faint galaxies as opposed to the shallow clash data , which restrict the search to bright galaxies even in the case of high magnification .",
    "in addition , the hff primary observations are complemented with data from _",
    "spitzer , alma , chandra , xmm _ , vla , vlt and subaru as well as our deep _",
    "hst_/wfc3 uv imaging in this study .",
    "since the beginning of the hff program , many groups have studied the faint - end of the uv lf at @xmath38 up to @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "there are two primary methods of identifying high redshift galaxies , via photometric redshifts and color - color selection of the lyman break .",
    "both techniques require assumptions about stellar populations , dust reddening and star formation histories . however , each technique has its advantages .",
    "the photometric redshift method uses the full sed whereas the lyman break method requires fewer filters and simpler completeness corrections .",
    "some groups use the lyman break technique ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while other groups prefer photometric redshifts ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a general agreement between the uv lfs from these two methods is shown both at intermediate @xcite and high redshift studies @xcite .",
    "one of the goals of this paper is to exploit the available multiwavelength imaging to provide a comparison between the uv lfs derived with these two selection techniques .    in this paper , we utilize the strong gravitational lensing magnification from three foreground galaxy clusters ( two from the hff program ) in combination with our deep wfc3/uvis imaging to construct a robust sample of faint star - forming galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "the study is similar to a14 , but spanning the entire redshift range @xmath0 , and measuring the lf behind three clusters instead of one .",
    "this allows us to study the evolution of the uv lf during the peak epoch of global star formation activity ( i.e. , @xmath0 ) , and compare with previous determinations .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : data ] , we summarize the available observations and the data reduction for each lensing cluster . the catalog construction and photometric redshift measurements are described in section [ sec : photometry ] and [ sec : photoz ] , respectively .",

    "_ hst _ imaging of three lensing clusters in a wide wavelength range , from uv to nir , as described below .",
    "the hff survey uses the _",
    "director s discretionary time ( go / dd 13495 , pi lotz ) , to obtain deep wfc3/ir and acs / wfc images of six lensing clusters and their parallel fields @xcite .",
    "the two hff clusters analyzed here , abell 2744 ( hereafter a2744 ) and macsj0717.5 + 3745 ( hereafter macsj0717 ) , were observed during cycles 21 and 22 , with 140 orbits of acs / wfc and wfc3/ir imaging for each cluster / field pair .",

    "in addition , we obtained deep near ultraviolet images in f275w ( 8 orbits ) and f336w(8 orbits ) for three hff clusters ( including a2744 and macsj0717 ) using the wfc3/uvis channel onboard _",
    "these deep uv images are part of _ hst _ program i d 13389 ( pi : b. siana ) , which were taken between november 2013 and april 2014 .    the space telescope science institute ( stsci ) handles the reduction and calibration of the optical and nir images of the hffs and releases the final mosaics in the mikulski archive for space telescopes ( mast ) .",
    "we used the version 1.0 release of the public optical and nir mosaics with a pixel scale of 60 mas pixel@xmath43 . to make these mosaics",
    ", the raw optical and nir exposures were initially calibrated using pyraf / stsdas ` calacs ` and ` calwf3 ` programs , respectively .",

    ", the hff team provides ",
    "self - calibrated \" acs images including more accurate dark subtraction and charge transfer efficiency ( cte ) correction as well as wfc3/ir images corrected for the time - variable sky lines .    to calibrate the raw uv data , we applied two major improvements in addition to the standard wfc3/uvis calibration approach .",
    "the first improvement is related to the cte degradation of the uvis ccd detectors .",
    "this degradation caused by radiation damage in the ccds , results in a loss of source flux and affects the photometry and morphology measurements especially in low background images ( e.g uv data , * ? ? ?",
    "to correct for these charge losses in our uv images , we used a pixel - based cte correction tool provided on the stsci website .",
    "the second improvement is in the dark current subtraction from the uv images . as shown in a recent work by @xcite , the standard",
    "wfcs3/uvis dark subtraction process is not sufficient for removing dark structures and hot pixels , mainly due to the low background level in the uv data .",
    "this regular technique leaves a background gradient and blotchy patterns in the final science image .",
    "therefore , we used a new methodology introduced by @xcite for subtracting the dark current and masking the hot pixels properly .",
    "a detailed description of this technique is presented in @xcite .    after making",
    "the modified calibrated uv images , we use the pyraf / drizzlepac package to drizzle these images to the same pixel scale of 60 mas and astrometrically align with the optical and nir data .",
    "the ` astrodrizzle ` program subtracts the background , rejects the cosmic rays , and corrects the input images for the geometric distortion due to the non - linear mapping of the sky onto the detector .",
    "in addition to the science output images , ` astrodrizzle ` generates an inverse variance map ( ivm ) which we used later to make the weight images and to calculate the image depths .",
    "a summary of all the images and their depths is given in table [ tab : depth ] .",
    "in addition to the two hff clusters , we observed the a1689 cluster .",

    "the cycle 18 data ( 30 orbits in f275w , 4 orbits in f336w ) were used in a14 to measure the uv lf of lensed , dwarf galaxies at @xmath30 . in cycle 20 , we added an f225w image ( 10 orbits ) and deeper f336w data ( 14 orbits , for a total of 18 orbits ) to expand our redshift range from @xmath0 .",

    "the contours in figure [ fig : lf_contour ] illustrate the correlation between the faint - end slope ( @xmath120 ) and the characteristic magnitude ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "the best shechter parameters derived through marginalization are shown with filled blue , green and red circles for @xmath8 , @xmath88 and @xmath9 samples , respectively .",
    "we are also overplotting our best lfs ( filled black circles ) from lbg samples ( see section [ sec : lf - lbg ] ) .",
    "the red dashed contours show the likelihood function at @xmath9 , before incorporating the @xmath119 prior .",
    "the systematic uncertainties  particularly in the size distribution assumption at faint luminosities  may affect the completeness corrections and thus the lf measurements at these magnitudes .",
    "this concern is also expressed in a recent paper by @xcite , where they measure very small sizes ( 160 - 240 pc ) for ultra - faint galaxies ( @xmath208 ) at @xmath209 and then discuss the possible effects due to uncertain size assumptions on the lf measurements .",
    "we should emphasize that they present their conclusions for a large redshift range of @xmath210 , while we expect the lower redshift galaxies ( @xmath30 ) to be on average larger than their high redshift counterparts ( as seen at higher luminosities , @xcite ) .",
    "our assumed size distribution for ultra - faint galaxies is the closest to the @xcite measurements , relative to the other lf studies .",
    "we run some experiments to investigate whether the faint galaxies with large completeness corrections ( i.e. , where the systematic uncertainty dominates ) , are dictating our best - fit lfs by excluding all of our galaxies with completeness below @xmath211 .",
    "this reduces the size of our @xmath8 , @xmath88 and @xmath9 samples by 33% , 53% and 44% , such that our final  complete \" samples have 186 , 127 and 141 galaxies , respectively . to be consistent ,",
    "we also remove the corresponding volumes from our total volume estimates .",
    "we then re - fit the lfs and measure faint - end slopes of @xmath12 , @xmath212 and @xmath213 at @xmath69 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "these estimates are all steep and show the same trend of steeper slopes toward higher redshifts , though with slightly shallower slopes .",
    "we note that , although the @xmath8 and @xmath88 faint - end slopes measured from the  complete \" sample are consistent with the slopes measured from the full sample , the @xmath9 slope from the  complete \" sample is significantly shallower by @xmath214 the individual errors added in quadrature ( though the measurements are nt completely independent , so adding in quadrature will slightly overestimate the uncertainties ) .",
    "the probability of obtaining such a deviation in at least one of the three slope measurements is small ( 10% ) , and suggests that the systematic uncertainties are not negligible .",
    "consequently , as also emphasized in @xcite , the size measurements of very faint galaxies will need to be more accurately determined for higher quality lf measurements .",
    "as discussed in section [ introduction ] , one of the goals of the present paper is to understand the effect of two widely used selection techniques . to this end , we have also performed a parallel determination of the uv luminosity function based on the lyman break  dropout \" selection at equivalent redshift ranges .",
    "a complete description of our color - color selection , sample contamination and the completeness simulation for dropouts is given in appendix [ appendixa ] .",
    "as explained there , our lbg samples consist of 19 f225w- , 178 f275w- and 142 f336w - dropouts at @xmath154 , @xmath161 and @xmath170 , respectively .",
    "we note that our lbg samples have fewer galaxies than our photometric redshift samples , because we require @xmath215 detection in the detection filter for these samples ( see appendix [ appendixa ] ) , whereas the photometric redshift samples only require a @xmath216 detection ( see section [ sec : selection ] ) . to ensure accurate detection of a break , we restrict our sample to objects where the imaging depth is sufficient to detect at least a one magnitude break ( at 1 sigma ) between the dropout filter ( f225w , f275w , and f336w at @xmath2171.65 , 2.0 , and 2.7 , respectively ) compared to the adjacent longer wavelength filter .",
    "this cut only removes two galaxies from the a2744 f336w - dropout lf and it does not change the rest of the lbg samples .    the effective volume including the completeness corrections is calculated for these samples using equation [ eq : v_eff ] . in order to estimate the binned uv lf for our lbg samples , we use the same methodology as we used for our primary photometric redshift samples .",
    "similarly , we restrict our dropout samples to galaxies with @xmath218 for the same reasons that were mentioned before ( see section [ sec : selection ] ) .",
    "this limit excludes 1 ( @xmath219 ) , 6 ( @xmath220 ) and 0 galaxies from the f225w- , f275w- , f336w - dropout lfs , respectively .",
    "finally , we have 18 , 172 and 140 galaxies for the @xmath154 , @xmath161 and @xmath170 lbg lfs , respectively .    furthermore , to constrain the bright - end of our f225w and f275w - dropout lfs",
    ", we incorporate the binned measurements from @xcite lbg samples . here , we do not use the mle technique because we do not have individual measurements for all of these bright - end lbg samples . we determine the best schechter parameters only using the simple @xmath221 technique , considering that these two methods of fitting ( mle vs @xmath221 ) show good agreement for the photometric redshift lfs . for our f336w - dropout lf , we only fit to our binned data keeping the characteristic magnitude @xmath222 at a fixed value of -20.7 , similar to what we used for our @xmath9 photometric redshift lf .",
    "the binned values and the best - fitting schechter parameters for the lbg lfs are given in tables [ tab : lf_bin ] and [ tab : lf_param ] , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig : lf - lbg ] compares our lf results derived for the photometric redshift and uv - dropout selections . from left to right , the f225w- , f275w- and f336w - dropout lfs shown with black circles are compared with the photometric redshift lfs at @xmath8 ( blue circles ) , @xmath88 ( green circles ) and @xmath9 ( red circles ) , respectively . together with our data points for each redshift range , we also show the bright - end lfs of @xcite derived from their photometric redshift ( blue , green and red squares ) and uv - dropout ( black squares ) samples .",
    "in addition , we include the lf results from several relevant studies @xcite . to compare these lf measurements , we run a set of monte carlo simulations and estimate the @xmath223 confidence interval from each best - fit schechter function .",
    "the gray and hatched regions in figure [ fig : lf - lbg ] encompass the @xmath223 uncertainties of the lbg and photometric redshift lfs , respectively . because our lbg samples have fewer galaxies than the photometric redshift samples , the corresponding lfs are more uncertain .",
    "our lfs are in agreement within these confidence regions .",
    "indeed , similar agreement between lfs derived from these two selection techniques at higher redshifts has been shown before @xcite .",
    "however , the lack of a robust knowledge of various systematic effects such as intrinsic size distribution and dust reddening at these faint luminosities still introduces moderate differences between these two lf measurements .          in order to understand the evolution of luminosity function parameters with redshift",
    ", we compare our best - fit schechter parameters with other determinations of the rest - frame uv luminosity function at higher and lower redshifts in figure [ fig : lf - parameters ] .",
    "we summarize the evolution of lf parameters as below :    exploiting the magnification from strong gravitational lensing and consequently extending the uv lf to very low luminosities , enables a robust estimate of the faint - end slope . in the context of recent uv lf studies , there are not as many measurements at @xmath224 to compare with our estimates , but as can be seen in figure [ fig : lf - parameters ] , our inferred value of the faint - end slope ( @xmath2 ) at @xmath8 is consistent with other results from @xcite and @xcite given their large uncertainties .",
    "we should note that we are in better agreement with the @xcite estimate for their lbg lf ( at @xmath225 ) , as their photometric redshift lf has a very steep faint - end slope .",
    "regarding our estimate for the @xmath88 lf , we are again in good agreement with several other results , particularly both lbg and photometric redshift lfs of @xcite and also the @xmath27 lf from @xcite .",
    "we note that we are also in agreement with our previous @xmath30 lbg lf from a14 ( @xmath33 ) . finally regarding our estimate for the @xmath9 lf",
    ", we derive a faint - end slope steeper than previous determinations and more similar to the steep faint - end slopes favored at higher redshifts . as a consequence , we conclude a rapid evolution in the faint - end slope toward shallower values during the 2.2 gyr from @xmath226 to @xmath227 which seems to continue to @xmath228 .",
    "we also refer the reader to a recent work by @xcite ( see gray filled stars in figure [ fig : lf - parameters ] ) who study the uv lf between @xmath229 . for both @xmath230 and @xmath231 , they derive a value of @xmath232 which is considerably shallower than most of the other studies including ours . consequently",
    ", they derive fainter @xmath119 and larger @xmath122 values relative to all of the other works at @xmath23 in the literature .",
    "we note that they do not use the filter that samples the lyman break at @xmath30 .",
    "in addition to the observed lfs , we compare our results with the lfs from local group ( lg ) fossil records by @xcite ( open green circles in figure [ fig : lf - parameters ] ) . using the sfhs of lg galaxies",
    ", they reconstruct the uv lfs down to very faint magnitudes of @xmath233 . comparing to our results",
    ", they estimate shallower faint - end slopes ( @xmath234 ) for their @xmath235 and 2.0 lfs , but they derive steeper faint - end slopes when they restrict their calculations to the luminosities where their data are complete .",
    "although , for an exact comparison , we need to consider the different uncertainties ( i.e , small sample size ) and systematic errors ( i.e , uncertainty in the stellar models used for the sfhs ) in their results , as well .",
    "this discrepancy between the faint - end slopes can be interpreted as a different evolution for the lg dwarfs relative to the field galaxies .",
    "as seen in the middle panel of figure [ fig : lf - parameters ] , our characteristic uv magnitude , @xmath119 , becomes brighter , @xmath236 , at @xmath230 relative to @xmath227 .",
    "also , our characteristic number density , @xmath122 , ( lower panel of figure [ fig : lf - parameters ] ) decreases by a factor of 1.5 over this time period . however , both of these measurements are dependent on data from other surveys , as our data only sample galaxies fainter than @xmath119 .",

    "figure [ fig : lf_all_redshift_nocluster ] shows these results for our three redshift ranges .",
    "we note that all of these calculations are from our photometric redshift lfs , as they have smaller statistical uncertainties .",
    "we normalized our cumulative uv luminosity densities to the corresponding value at @xmath118=-10 assuming that there is no turnover in the lf down to this absolute magnitude . to estimate the 1@xmath45 uncertainty at each @xmath118 , we run a gibbs sampler ( i.e. , markov chain monte carlo sampling ) to obtain a sequence of random pairs of ( @xmath120,@xmath119 ) using their 2d joint probability function and then calculate the distribution of uv luminosity density and the corresponding uncertainty .",

    "intrinsic _ uv luminosity density and thus to the star formation rate density at these epochs .",

    "we should note that there is no straightforward way to estimate the @xmath246 uncertainties as necessary information for these measurements such as covariance between schechter parameters are not usually provided in the literature .",
    "but to assign uncertainty to each @xmath246 measurement in a consistent way , we use the same methodology as @xcite .",
    "we assume that the fractional error , i.e. , @xmath254 , provided by each author is fixed and thus derive the corresponding uncertainty for our @xmath246 value with @xmath255 .",
    "figure [ fig : ld_evolution ] illustrates these measurements . as seen in many previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the unobscured ( i.e , uncorrected for dust extinction ) uv luminosity density rises from @xmath228 to @xmath256 where it reaches its peak and starts to decline after @xmath257 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "as shown in figure [ fig : ld_evolution ] , our @xmath246 points ( black filled circles ) follow the similar trend as seen by previous determinations . however , our measurements show a more rapid evolution from @xmath227 to @xmath230 followed by a slower evolution up to @xmath226 .",
    "we emphasize that the unobscured @xmath246 evolution rate and the exact location of the peak depends on the wavelength @xcite where @xmath246 is being measured , and the limiting luminosity , i.e. , @xmath252 in equation [ eq : ldensity ] .",
    "therefore , to find the best - fitting function describing the evolution of unobscured uv luminosity density between @xmath258 , we only include the results from the literature at the same wavelength ( 1500 ) and integrated down to the same magnitude of @xmath259 through our own compilation .",

    "in this section , we outline our selection criteria to find lyman break galaxies @xcite .",
    "we adopted a standard color - color diagram to sample the uv continuum break in the sed of high redshift galaxies .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : lbg ] , the selection region is defined based on the location of tracks of star forming galaxies in the color - color plot .",
    "the star - forming tracks are predictions from @xcite synthetic stellar population models assuming a constant star formation history , @xmath281 and an age of 100 myr with different color excess of e(b - v)=[0,0.1,0.2,0.3 ] . in the next subsection , we summarize the selection criteria we use to identify the z @xmath282 galaxies . as a1689 is observed with different sets of filters than the hffs , it is not possible to use the same color criteria for all of these fields .",
    "therefore , we construct analogous selection criteria as below .    for f225w dropout sources , considering that a1689 is the only field where f225w images are available , the selection criteria are as below , @xmath283 @xmath284",
    "@xmath285 @xmath286 @xmath287 these color criteria , which are identical to @xcite find 31 galaxy candidates in a1689 .    for f275w dropout sources , the selection criteria for a1689 with f625w - band imaging are @xmath288 @xmath289 @xmath290 @xmath291 @xmath292 these color criteria , which are identical to what we used before in a14 find 99 galaxy candidates in a1689 . for f275w dropout sources , the selection criteria for hffs where f606w - band imaging are available instead of f625w - band data , we use identical selection criteria as for a1689 . in total , these color criteria find 230 galaxy candidate over three clusters .",
    "99 of these candidates are from a1689 in comparison with 84 candidates in a14 , because we added 14 orbits to the 4 orbits of f336w image that we used in a14 .    for f336w dropout sources , the selection criteria for hffs are @xmath293 @xmath294 @xmath295 @xmath296 @xmath297 these criteria find 189 galaxy candidates over hffs .",
    "similar to our @xmath298 photometric redshift sample ( see section [ sec : selection ] ) , we do not include a1689 in our f336w - dropout sample as there is contamination from cluster members . as discussed in section [ sec : selection ] , we remove all of the multiple images corresponding to a single source except the brightest image .",
    "we then use the same identification scheme as our photometric redshift samples to remove contamination from stars , stellar spikes and spurious detections from low - redshift bright galaxies .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : lbg ] , the stellar sequence ( orange asterisks ) enters the selection region of f225w- and f336w - dropouts , resulting a contamination of @xmath299 and @xmath300 of stars , respectively .",
    "we also excluded a low contamination of @xmath301 and @xmath302 from the stellar spikes and spurious objects in the f275w- and f336w - dropouts , respectively .",
    "in addition , our photometric redshift measurements show that the fraction of low - redshift interlopers in the lbg samples are low .",
    "we find that only @xmath303 , @xmath304 and @xmath305 of our f225w- , f275w- and f336w - dropout samples are low - redshift interloper with @xmath306 , @xmath307 and @xmath308 , respectively .",
    "as illustrated in figure [ fig : z_distribution ] and explained in next section , we derive these redshift cuts using the expected redshift distribution from our completeness simulations for dropout samples .",
    "-0.4 in    -0.4 in",
    "following the analysis for our photometric redshift sample , we run the same monte carlo simulation to assess the completeness values , c(m , z , @xmath78 ) , for the lyman break samples .",
    "as described in details in section [ sec : completeness ] , after generating the random artificial galaxies with similar properties as observed sources , we require the same selection criteria ( equations a1 to a3 ) as we used for the observed lbgs . figure [ fig : z_distribution ] illustrates the completeness distribution for two intrinsic apparent magnitudes ( i.e. , before magnification ) of @xmath309 and magnification @xmath310 mag . to compare with the observed galaxies , we over - plot the photometric redshift distribution of the whole catalog together with the subsample selected as lbg .",
    "as seen in this figure , the redshift distribution of lbgs ( blue histograms ) relative to the redshift distribution of all galaxies in the field ( grey histograms ) are consistent with the completeness calculations .",
    "as described in section [ subsec : multi ] , we identify 5 new multiply lensed system candidates in a1689 .",
    "table [ tab : multi ] summarizes these systems where we provide their photometric redshift estimates and color measurements , as well . because one of the primary indicators of multiple images is their uniform colors ( i.e.",
    ", magnification is independent of wavelength ) , we show their rgb composite image ( see figure [ fig : stamp ] ) combining f814w , f625w and f475w data as red , green and blue filters . in figure",
    "[ fig : critical ] , we show the positions of all 5 new systems on a color - composite image of a1689 .",
    "we also overplot the critical lines at @xmath311 .",
    "the rgb colors are similar to figure [ fig : stamp ] .",
