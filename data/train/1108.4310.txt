    "it is known that at relatively great link inflow rates in a city network at least some of the vehicles , which are waiting within a vehicle queue at light signal during the red phase of light signal , can not pass the intersection during the green phase ( so called an over - saturation regime of traffic ) . in this case",
    ", the queue can grow non - limited over time leading to traffic gridlock in a city .",
    "for this reason , through light signal control at city intersections an under - saturated traffic is sought in which all vehicles , which are waiting within the queue at light signal during the red phase , can pass the intersection during the green phase resulting in the fully dissolution of the queue during the green phase ( for a review see  @xcite ) .",

    "vehicles decelerate at the upstream front of a queue at light signal as they do this at the upstream front of a wide moving jam propagating on a road without light signals  @xcite ; during the green phase , vehicles accelerate at the downstream queue front with a random time delay as they do it at the downstream jam front . during the yellow phase of light signal ( between the green and red phases ) the vehicle passes the light signal location ,",

    "any initial vehicle queue at light signal that has been developed during the red phase of light signal dissolves fully during the green phase .    the main result of this article is as follows : in this initial under - saturated traffic , after a random time delay a first - order phase transition from free flow to synchronized flow ( f@xmath0s transition )  @xcite can occur upstream of the queue .",
