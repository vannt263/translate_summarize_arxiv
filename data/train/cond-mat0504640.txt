    "since the discovery of high-@xmath4 cuprates , strong correlations among electrons have been considered as the crucial reason for anomalous transport properties in the normal state of these materials .",
    "prominent example is the d.c .",
    "resistivity obeying the well - known linear law , @xmath16 , in the intermediate ( optimum ) range of hole doping accompanied by an anomalous but universal frequency dependent optical conductivity @xmath0 , phenomenologically described via a marginal - fermi - liquid ( mfl ) scenario @xcite or the quantum - critical behavior.@xcite in the last decade the emphasis has been centered on the experimental investigations of the underdoped regime in various cuprates .",
    "the main signatures of this regime are the kink in d.c .",
    "@xmath1 at the crossover scale @xmath17 @xcite and the appearance of a broad peak in the infrared region ( mid - ir ) @xcite as well as of the pseudogap scale in @xmath0.@xcite recently , it has been established within this regime that the mobility of holes increases with doping concentration.@xcite    from the theoretical point of view , it is not an easy task to construct an analytical transport theory for strongly correlated systems , starting from a microscopic model that describes the motion of charge in a weakly or moderately doped antiferromagnetic ( afm ) insulator . even at present",
    "such a theory is lacking .",
    "however , numerical investigations of the prototype models , in particular of the @xmath2-@xmath3 model , show that @xmath0 and @xmath1 of cuprates can be reasonably accounted for .",
    "application of the finite - temperature lanczos method ( ftlm ) @xcite to small systems yields results being most reliable in the regime of intermediate doping @xcite where also the experimental window @xmath18  k can be probed best . in the latter regime ,",
    "numerical results show an overall agreement with the simple scaling @xmath19 , with the only scale given by temperature @xmath20.@xcite    recently , several aspects of the conductivity in cuprates have been reopened urging for reconsideration and improvement of theoretical and model results .",
    "detailed experimental studies in the optimally doped cuprate bi@xmath21sr@xmath21ca@xmath22y@xmath23cu@xmath21o@xmath24 ( bscco ) @xcite reveal for @xmath25 the @xmath20-independent power - law behavior @xmath26 with @xmath9 .",
    "the authors attribute such a scaling to the vicinity of the quantum - critical point.@xcite    another question is the existence and value of the resistivity saturation in cuprates at low hole doping.@xcite it has been realized that cuprates at high @xmath20 and low doping show very large resistivity @xmath27@xcite and thus violate the naive ioffe - regel condition for metals , which implies a saturation of @xmath1 when the scattering length @xmath28 reaches the intercell distance . on the basis of the @xmath2-@xmath3 model",
    "the modified saturation value @xmath29 has been derived @xcite and its anomalous large value has been ascribed to the kinetic energy being strongly suppressed due to strong correlations , in particular @xmath30 close to half - filling , where @xmath31 is the hole number concentration . from the experimental view , la@xmath32sr@xmath33cuo@xmath34 ( lsco ) serves as a prototype cuprate with a well controlled hole doping @xmath35 and stable material properties .",
    "previous and recent results @xcite in single - crystal lsco have revealed signatures of saturation at high @xmath36  k. plausibly , the saturation phenomenon is related to the emergence of a @xmath20 window , where @xmath37 is quite flat or even develops a shallow dip .",
    "@xcite the latter phenomenon is clearly related to the appearance of a broad mid - ir peak at @xmath38 first found at low doping in lsco @xcite and recently also in yba@xmath21cu@xmath39o@xmath40 ( ybco ) .",
    "@xcite    recently , estimates were presented @xcite that the @xmath2-@xmath3 model yields substantially smaller resistivity @xmath1 than experiments in lsco for the regime of low doping .",
    "this apparently leads to a conclusion that coupling to additional degrees of freedom , in particular to phonons , might be essential to explain the large resistivity .",
    "this aspect is clearly of importance since it is related to the central question , i.e. , to what extent the @xmath2-@xmath3 model and strong correlations alone can describe the physics of high-@xmath4 cuprates .",
    "the existence of the mid - ir resonance in @xmath0 is experimentally well established at low doping , @xcite however the consensus on its origin has not been reached yet .",
    "we note that such a peak has been reproduced already in calculations of @xmath0 for a single hole within the @xmath2-@xmath3 model at @xmath41 @xcite and has been attributed to the string - picture of incoherent hole motion leading to the shoulder at @xmath42 .",
    "@xcite however , a confirmation of this feature in more realistic @xmath43 calculation was missing so far .",
    "the aim of this paper is to give answers to above questions via a systematic reinvestigation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 within the extended @xmath2-@xmath3 model , considering also the influence of the next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) hopping @xmath5 which has already been invoked in the modeling of hole and electron doped cuprates@xcite to possibly reveal the pronounced difference of @xmath0 between both classes of cuprates .",
    "additional hopping parameter @xmath5 has been identified to be important for the explanation of spectral properties , e.g. , the band dispersion as measured via the angle - resolved photoemission experiments ( arpes).@xcite even more , @xmath44 could be the essential parameter discriminating various families of hole - doped cuprates ( lsco , bscco etc . ) , @xcite in particular their superconducting transition temperature @xmath4 .",
    "relative to the previous work @xcite we are able to study somewhat larger size systems using the ftlm . at the same time",
    "we improve the method by introducing averaging over twisted boundary conditions ( tbc ) , described furtheron .",
    "the improvement shows up in a more controlled behavior of @xmath0 at low @xmath45 , being essential to extract reproducible @xmath1 at lower @xmath20 . in the intermediate doping we present calculations for systems up to @xmath46 sites to clarify the universal behavior of @xmath0 . in the low - doping regime",
    "we study systems up to @xmath47 sites allowing us to establish the emergence of a pseudogap scale in @xmath0 as well as the onset of a more coherent transport for @xmath48 . our results still remain restricted to @xmath49  k. nevertheless , they confirm the qualitative behavior of @xmath0 in cuprates , with the quantitative discrepancy in @xmath1 compared to experiments within a factor of 2 at most .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii the improved ftlm method , employing the tbc averaging , is described .",
    "the comparison of results with the usual fixed - boundary condition ( bc ) method is presented . in sec .",
    "iii the optimum doping results for @xmath0 and @xmath1 are presented and discussed in connection with the scaling behavior and experimental results for cuprates . in sec .",
    "iv the low - doping regime is examined , with the emphasis on the emergence of the shoulder corresponding to the mid - ir peak in @xmath0 , the resistivity saturation and the onset of a coherent transport for @xmath48 .",
    "conclusions are given in sec .",
    "in the following we study numerically the extended @xmath2-@xmath3 model @xmath50 on a square lattice , whereby we include besides the nearest neighbor ( nn ) hopping @xmath51 also nnn hopping @xmath52 .",
    "strong correlations among electrons are incorporated via projected operators , e.g. , @xmath53 , which do not allow for a double occupancy of sites .",
    "the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath5 has already been examined in connection with the difference between the hole - doped and electron - doped cuprates.@xcite however , the influence of @xmath5 on the d.c .",
    "transport is less evident and has not been studied systematically so far.@xcite plausibly , it is expected that @xmath44 , being appropriate for hole - doped cuprates , leads to a larger frustration of the afm spin background and consequently to a larger resistivity . in our study",
    "we will test the behavior at three different @xmath6 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "we keep everywhere @xmath56 as appropriate for cuprates , as well as we note that @xmath57  ev for a direct comparison with experiments .",
    "the main limitation to the validity of numerical results comes from the finite - size effects which begin to dominate results at low @xmath58 . as a criterion for @xmath59 we use the thermodynamic sum @xcite @xmath60 , \\label{thsum}\\ ] ] calculated in a given system for fixed hole number @xmath61 and the requirement @xmath62 . in the following we use @xmath63 .",
    "finite size effects can be substantially reduced by employing the tbc averaging.@xcite in a system with periodic bc the latter is achieved by introducing an uniform vector potential @xmath64 modifying the hopping elements @xmath65 by a phase factor .",
    "we use furtheron @xmath66 different phases @xmath64 instead of an usually fixed bc @xmath67 . for an arbitrary operator @xmath68 we then perform the usual thermodynamic averaging over @xmath66 different tbc @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 refer to the canonical ftlm expectation values obtained for each fixed phase @xmath64 . in order to preserve the translational invariance of the lattice hamiltonian in 2d we are allowed to study tilted square lattices with @xmath72 sites where @xmath72 must be pythagorean , i.e. , @xmath73 .",
    "consequently the first brillouin zone , where the phases are chosen equidistantly , is a tilted square and @xmath66 is also chosen pythagorean , so that the phases form a regular square lattice as well .",
    "effectively , such a choice reproduces , e.g. , for free fermions the regular ( square ) lattice of @xmath74 points in the @xmath75 space within the first brillouin zone .",
    "there are several advantages of the tbc averaging procedure :    \\a ) in the limit @xmath76 ( for large enough @xmath66 ) this method reproduces for an arbitrary quantity , e.g. for @xmath0 , the result corresponding to the ground state wavefunction @xmath77 with @xmath78  min . for a chosen system with @xmath72 sites and @xmath61 holes .",
    "\\b ) in a finite ( nonintegrable ) system , even for @xmath43 , we generally expect the 2d optical conductivity of the form @xmath79 where @xmath80 @xmath81 is the charge stiffness representing the nondissipative part of conductivity , emerging due to nonscattered coherent charge propagation in a finite system with periodic bc , and @xmath82 is the kinetic stress tensor or the generalized kinetic energy which in the case of nn hopping on a square lattice reduces to the usual kinetic energy , i.e. , @xmath83 .",
    "@xcite since @xmath84,@xcite the tbc averaging leads automatically to @xmath85 as appropriate for a metal .",
    "note that previous calculations of @xmath0 at fixed @xmath67 @xcite generally suffered on a quite system dependent @xmath86 which was in many cases even negative .",
    "\\c ) in general , the tbc averaging reduces finite - size effects , although it can not completely eliminate them .",
    "results for @xmath0 are thus more size and shape independent . in fig .  1 we present the comparison of results for a single hole @xmath87 in different systems @xmath88 , as obtained for a fixed bc @xmath67 and when using the tbc averaging .",
    "there is a clear difference in the low-@xmath45 regime where @xmath81 can be even negative for a fixed bc , while rather consistent results are obtained when applying the improved method .",
    "moreover , the tbc averaged @xmath0 display quite evident and consistent shoulder at @xmath89 , corresponding to the mid - ir peak in cuprates , @xcite while this feature is hardly visible for fixed bc spectra .    in the following",
    ", we present results using typically @xmath90 and @xmath91 lanczos steps within each symmetry sector of the hilbert space . since tbc averaging now also takes the role of random sampling we do not perform any additional sampling over the initial lanczos wavefunction within each sector . in each of the available systems @xmath92 we are able to reach @xmath93 for the intermediate doping and somewhat higher for low doping . in the analysis of @xmath0 spectra broadening @xmath94",
    "one of the most striking facts in cuprates , recognized from the beginning , is the universality of the charge response @xmath95 in the vicinity of the optimum doping . whereas the d.c .",
    "resistivity shows a linear variation @xmath96 , also @xmath0 can be analyzed with an anomalous drude - like relaxation rate @xmath97 .",
    "the only relevant @xmath45 scale seems to be given by @xmath20 itself , as summarized within the phenomenological mfl scenario.@xcite recent study of optimally doped bscco system has revealed , that at low @xmath20 in a broad range of @xmath98  ev one can describe results with a power law @xmath26 , whereby @xmath99.@xcite still , it is not possible to represent results for @xmath95 in the whole @xmath100 range with a single universal function of @xmath101 as , e.g. , required within the quantum - critical - point scenario.@xcite    0.8truecm    numerical results for @xmath0 within the @xmath2-@xmath3 model are most reliable at intermediate doping , since there the lowest @xmath59 can be reached within a fixed system of @xmath72 sites.@xcite in fig .  2 we present results for a lattice of @xmath46 sites and @xmath102 holes , i.e. , the hole doping @xmath103 , at various @xmath104 and different @xmath105 .",
    "obtained 2d @xmath0 can serve as a test for the scaling behavior .",
    "the optical sum rule , @xmath106 requires a fast fall - off of @xmath0 for large @xmath107 , hence one can discuss the scaling only for @xmath108 .    in fig .",
    "3 we study @xmath0 for @xmath6 within the regime @xmath109 . we see that the fall - off is slower than @xmath110 and is well described with the power law @xmath111 with @xmath112 .",

    "i.e. , we find @xmath216 down to @xmath161 at @xmath182 , whereas evidently we get @xmath164 at the same @xmath20 in the low - doping regime .",
    "this apparent contradiction is , however , consistent with recent experimental confirmation of a quite coherent transport at low doping for @xmath48 and the concept of a nodal metal .",
    "@xcite    while qualitative behavior of @xmath1 is well in agreement with experiments , let us finally comment on the quantitative comparison . at intermediate doping",
    "the normalized resistivity @xmath15 lies tolerably within the range of existing experimental values for lsco , taking into account also some variation between different published results . at low doping our results",
    "seem to underestimate somewhat @xmath1 . still , the discrepancy ( depending again on different experimental data ) is at most of a factor of @xmath199 .",
    "whether this rather modest disagreement is an indication of the possible relevant role of degrees of freedom outside the @xmath2-@xmath3 model , remains an open question .",
