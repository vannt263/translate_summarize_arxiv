    "a prominent broad ( with a fwhm of @xmath12@xmath0 ) emission feature at about 21@xmath0 high resolution spectra obtained with the _ short - wavelength spectrometer _ ( sws ) instrument ( with a resolution of @xmath2 ) on board the _ infrared space observatory _ show that this feature actually peaks at @xmath120.1@xmath0 ( volk , kwok , & hrivnak 1999 ) .",
    "but for historical reasons , this feature continues to be referred to as the `` 21@xmath0 feature '' .",
    "] was discovered by kwok , volk , & hrivnak ( 1989 ) in an analysis of the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( iras ) _ low resolution spectrometer _ ( lrs ) spectra of four carbon - rich post - asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , and subsequently confirmed by both ground - based and airborne _ kuiper airborne observatory _ and iso observations ( see kwok , volk , & hrivnak 1999 and references therein ) . so far , this feature has been detected in twelve post - agb stars ( commonly termed as the `` 21@xmath0 sources '' ; kwok et al .",
    "1999 ) feature was recently reported for three planetary nebulae ( pns ; hony , waters , & tielens 2001 ; k. volk 2003 , in preparation ) . ] , with little shape variation found between different sources .",
    "these stars have quite uniform properties : they are mostly metal - poor carbon - rich f and g supergiants with strong infrared ( ir ) excesses and overabundant @xmath3-process elements ( see kwok et al .  1999 ) .",
    "the carrier of this mysterious 21@xmath0 feature remains unidentified , although many candidate materials have been proposed including iron oxides fe@xmath4o@xmath5 or fe@xmath5o@xmath6 , hydrogenated amorphous carbon , hydrogenated fullerenes , hydrogenated nanodiamond , amides ( thiourea or urea @xmath7_2}$ ] ) , sis@xmath4 , oxygen - bearing side groups in coal ( see kwok et al .",
    "1999 and references therein ) , and more recently titanium carbide ( tic ) nanoclusters ( von helden et al .",
    "2000 ) , sic ( speck & hofmeister 2003 ) , and stochastically - heated silicon core - sio@xmath4 mantle nanograins ( smith & witt 2002 ; li & draine 2002 ) .",
    "the nano - tic model seems attractive . while bulk tic does not show any noticeable feature near 20.1@xmath0 ( henning & mutschke 2000 ) , laboratory absorption spectra of tic nanocrystals containing 27125 atoms exhibit a distinct feature at @xmath120.1@xmath0 , closely resembling the astronomical 21@xmath0 emission feature both in peak position , width , and in spectral details ( von helden et al .",
    "this model further gains its strength from the identification of presolar tic grains ( with radii @xmath1100@xmath8 ) in primitive meteorites as inclusions embedded in micrometer - sized presolar graphite grains ( bernatowicz et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "since ti is a rare element , it is important to know whether the amount of tic dust required to account for the observed 21@xmath0 feature is a reasonable quantity .",
    "since the optical properties of nano tic in the ultraviolet ( uv)/visible wavelength range are unknown , one has to rely on those of bulk tic as a starting point .",
    "such an attempt has recently been made for the post - agb star @xmath9 by hony et al .",
    "they found that to explain the observed 21@xmath0 feature , the tic model requires a much higher uv / visible absorptivity than that of bulk tic ( by a factor of @xmath1020 ) .",
    "however , we will demonstrate in this _",
    "letter _ how the tic absorption integrated over a finite wavelength range places a lower limit on the tic dust mass through the kramers - kronig dispersion relations . for @xmath9 , this kramers - kronig lower limit",
    "exceeds the maximum available tic mass by a factor of @xmath1050 , independent of the absolute value of the uv / visible absorptivity .",
    "therefore , increasing the uv / visible absorptivity is unable to avoid the tic abundance problem .",
    "@xmath9 , a bright ( visual magnitude @xmath18.3 ) post - agb star with a spectral type of f0 - 5i , is one of the four 21@xmath0 sources originally discovered by kwok et al .  ( 1989 ) .",
    "mid - ir imaging of this object at 11.9@xmath0 shows that its circumstellar dust is confined to an area of 1.2@xmath112.6@xmath11 from the star ( hony et al .",
    "detailed modeling of its dust ir spectral energy distribution suggested a @xmath12 dust spatial distribution at @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the distance from the star , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are respectively the inner and outer edge of the @xmath9 dusty envelope ( hony et al .",
    "if tic nanograins are indeed present in @xmath9 and follow the distribution of the bulk ( hydrogenated ) amorphous carbon dust , the total power absorbed by the tic dust would be is assumed to be optically thin .",
    "if there actually exists appreciable extinction ( e.g. , hony et al .  [ 2003 ] found an average visual extinction of @xmath11.1@xmath17 ) , the conclusion of this _ letter _ would be strengthened since when exposed to an attenuated stellar radiation field , the tic model would require more tic dust to account for the same 21@xmath0 feature strength . ]",
    "@xmath18 where @xmath19 is the total mass of the tic nanoparticle component , @xmath20 is the mass absorption coefficient ( @xmath21 ) for nano tic grains of size @xmath22 at wavelength @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the stellar radius , @xmath25 is the flux per unit wavelength ( @xmath26 ) at the top of the illuminating star s atmosphere . in the nanometer size domain ,",
    "tic grains are in the rayleigh limit and hence @xmath27 is independent of size @xmath22 in the wavelength range where the stellar radiation peaks .",

    "was estimated to be @xmath37 ( hony et al .",
    "a _ lower _",
    "limit on the total mass of the tic dust required to account for the observed 21@xmath0 feature can be obtained by assuming that all the energy absorbed by the tic dust would be emitted solely in this feature : @xmath38 apparently , the required tic dust mass @xmath39 is sensitive to the material s uv / visible absorptivity . on the other hand , an _ upper _",
    "limit on the total mass of the tic dust which could be present in the circumstellar envelope around @xmath9 can be estimated from its photospheric ti abundance @xmath40 ( van winckel & reyniers 2000 ) and the envelope mass ( including both gas and dust ) @xmath41 ( hony et al .",
    "2003 ) : @xmath42 .",
    "since the uv / visible absorption properties of nano tic are unknown , we will first represent them by those of bulk tic .",
    "using mie theory and the optical constants measured for bulk tic samples ( koide et al .",
    "1993 ) , we calculate the uv / visible absorption efficiency @xmath43 of spherical tic nanograins . for illustration ,",
    "we plot in figure [ fig : qabs ] the mass absorption coefficients ( @xmath44 $ ] where @xmath45 is the tic mass density ) of tic spheres of radii @xmath22=10@xmath8 calculated from the optical constants of bulk tic . using these @xmath46 values , we derive a lower limit of @xmath47 on the tic dust mass from eq.([eq : mtic ] ) .",
    "apparently , if nano tic grains do not have a much higher uv / visible absorptivity than their bulk counterparts , they can not be the 21@xmath0 feature carrier since the minimum required tic dust mass is larger than the maximum available tic mass ( @xmath42 ; see  [ sec : obs ] ) by over two orders of magnitude !",
    "hony et al .",
    "( 2003 ) assumed a hypothetical absorption efficiency for tic nanograins @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the `` constant level '' uv / visible mass absorption coefficient .",
    "they concluded that the astronomical 21@xmath0 feature could _ only _ be accounted for by the tic model with a reasonable amount of tic dust mass _ if _ nano tic grains have an uv / visible absorption efficiency as high as @xmath50 where @xmath51 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : qabs ] we also plot the hony et al .",
    "( 2003 ) hypothetical mass absorption coefficient with @xmath52 . in comparison with the @xmath27 values calculated from the optical constants of bulk tic , the hony et al .",
    "( 2003 ) formula greatly enhances the ability of tic dust in absorbing the @xmath9 stellar radiation which peaks at @xmath23@xmath1@xmath53 . in figure",
    "[ fig : mtic ] we show the minimum tic dust mass @xmath39 required to account for the observed 21@xmath0 feature as a function of @xmath49 .",
    "it can be seen that if @xmath54 , the minimum required tic dust mass could be smaller than the maximum available tic mass , implying that the tic model may be tenable .",
    "let @xmath55 be the total extinction cross sections of tic dust at wavelength @xmath23 , and @xmath56 be the extinction integrated over the entire wavelength range from 0 to @xmath57 .",
    "as shown by purcell ( 1969 ) , the kramers - kronig ( kk ) dispersion relations can be used to relate @xmath56 to the total grain volume @xmath58 through @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the orientationally - averaged polarizability relative to the polarizability of an equal - volume conducting sphere ( purcell 1969 ; draine 2003 ) .",
    "we can apply eq.([eq : kk ] ) to the @xmath9 circumstellar envelope to obtain a lower bound on the tic dust mass @xmath61 , taking the envelope to be a vacuum sparsely populated by spheroidal tic grains .",
    "this is justified since the total volume of the tic grains ( @xmath1@xmath62 for a total mass of @xmath63 ) is negligible compared to the total volume of the dusty circumstellar envelope around @xmath9 ( @xmath1@xmath64 ) .",
    "apparently , the envelope also satisfies the prerequisite @xmath65 for the kk relations to be applicable ( where @xmath66 is not the dielectric constant of tic , but of the envelope itself ) . ] since @xmath67 ( where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the total absorption and scattering cross sections , respectively ) , the integration of @xmath68 over a finite wavelength range represents a lower limit to @xmath56 , and implies a lower limit to the volume of space which must be filled by tic grains and hence a lower limit to the total tic dust mass @xmath70 the dimensionless factor @xmath60 depends only upon the grain shape and the static ( zero - frequency ) dielectric constant @xmath71 of the grain material ( purcell 1969 ; draine 2003 ) .",
    "since tic is a metallic material , we calculate the @xmath60 factors expected for highly conducting materials ( i.e. , @xmath72 ) as a function of the axial ratio @xmath73 ( where @xmath22 and @xmath74 are the semiaxis along and perpendicular to the symmetry axis of the spheroid , respectively ) .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : dpol ] , @xmath60 would not appreciably exceed unity unless the highly conducting grains are highly elongated ( for prolates ) or flattened ( for oblates ) .",
    "if they are just modestly elongated ot flattened like interstellar grains ( @xmath753 [ greenberg & li 1996 ] or @xmath762 [ lee & draine 1985 ] ) , we would expect @xmath77 .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to adopt @xmath78 in the following discussions .    it is immediately seen in eq.([eq : mtickk ] ) that one can not relax the tic mass requirement just by increasing the uv / visible absorption level ; instead , the kramers - kronig lower limit to the total tic dust mass @xmath61 is independent of the absolute level of @xmath46 . as discussed in  [ sec : qabs ] , the nano - tic model appears to be tenable if one adopts the hony et al .",
    "( 2003 ) @xmath27 formula with @xmath54 .",
    "however , the kk relations ( see eq.[[eq : mtickk ] ] ) results in a lower bound of @xmath79 to the total tic dust mass , exceeding the maximum available tic mass of @xmath42 ( see  [ sec : obs ] ) to be really generous , we can obtain an upper limit of @xmath80 by assuming that all ti elements in @xmath9 ( with a zero - age main - sequence mass of @xmath11.1@xmath81 ) have condensed in the form of tic . the tic model with @xmath82",
    "( see  [ sec : qabs ] and eq.[[eq : kabshony ] ] ) would then appear tenable since @xmath83 . but",
    "the kk lower limit on the tic mass @xmath79 is far in excess of @xmath84 unless the tic nanograins are extremely elongated ( @xmath85 ) or flattened ( @xmath86 ) so that @xmath87 .",
    "] by a factor of @xmath190 .",
    "therefore , it appears that the nano - tic model encounters great difficulty in meeting the tic abundance constraint . in order for the tic dust mass",
    "@xmath61 derived from the kk relations not to exceed the maximum available tic mass @xmath84 , the tic nanograins should be extremely elongated ( @xmath88 ) for prolates or flattened ( @xmath89 ) for oblates so that @xmath90 .",
    "but it is hard to imagine how such extremely - shaped tic nanograins could form and survive in circumstellar environments . ]",
    "one may argue that the hony et al .",
    "( 2003 ) formula ( eq.[[eq : kabshony ] ] ) does not make economical use of the tic absorption .",
    "a fine tuning on the spectral dependence of @xmath27 might be able to enhance the grain s `` ability '' to absorb stellar radiation , resulting in an increase in @xmath91 and a decrease in @xmath61 ( see eq.[[eq : mtickk ] ] ) .",
    "we have tried models with a drude profile - like uv / visible absorption spectrum @xmath92 $ ] with @xmath93 and @xmath94 ( see fig.[fig : qabs ] ) `` _ tailored _ '' to optimize the `` ability '' of tic nanograins to absorb the @xmath9 stellar radiation .",
    "but it is found that models using this @xmath46 functional form require a kramers - kronig lower limit of @xmath95 , still @xmath150 times larger than the maximum available tic mass .",
    "profile leads to a smaller @xmath61 , provided its peak is fixed at @xmath96 .",
    "however , even if we adopt an unphysical @xmath97-function for @xmath27 , the corresponding kk lower limit @xmath98 still exceeds @xmath84 by a factor of @xmath127 .",
    "we note that the grain surface scattering of electrons alone would result in a plasma resonance width of @xmath10.1@xmath0 for a 10@xmath8 grain a typical fermi velocity @xmath99 ( see li 2004 ) . ]",
    "in this _ letter _ we have assumed that the tic dust follows the spatial distribution of the bulk carbon dust ( see  [ sec : obs ] ) .",
    "but this is not critical . even if we assume that all the tic dust accumulates at the inner edge of the envelope , to explain the observed 21@xmath0 feature , one still needs @xmath142% of the total tic mass derived in   [ sec : qabs],[sec : kk ] , since for the latter the average starlight intensity to which the dust is exposed is just @xmath142% higher .",
    "therefore , local density enhancement of tic would not overcome the tic abundance problem .",
    "high - resolution ( fwhm 0.4@xmath11 ) imaging at 20.8@xmath0 revealed two bright blobs at @xmath11@xmath11 from the star , but their surface brightness is at most two times higher than the average ( kwok , volk , & hrivnak 2002 ) , suggesting the insignificance of local density enhancement of the 21@xmath0 feature carrier .",
    "von helden etal .",
    "( 2000 ) postulated that tic nanograins could have formed during the extreme conditions ( i.e. , high density and high pressure ) associated with the short , high mass - loss superwind phase where agb stars lose the remaining stellar envelope , terminating their life on the agb and starting the transition to the pn phase .",
    "however , kwok et al .  ( 2002 ) argued that there is no evidence that the 21@xmath0 emission is created by a sudden ejection at the end of the agb , implying that the necessary physical conditions required to form tic in the ejecta of carbon - rich evolved stars may not be met .    in summary ,",
    "although we are lack of experimental knowledge of the uv / visible absorption properties of nano tic , a physical argument based on the kramers - kronig dispersion relations implies that the nano - tic model requires too much ti to reconcile with the observed photospheric ti abundance . feature . ] recently , the nano - tic model was also challenged by chigai et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , who found that the abundance ratio of ti to si needed to reproduce the observed flux ratios of the 11.3@xmath0 sic feature to the 21@xmath0 tic feature of post - agb stars must be at least 5 times larger than the solar abundance ratio .",
    "finally , we should note that laboratory absorption spectra of tic nanoclusters also show prominent features at other wavelengths which are not seen in post - agb stars ( e.g. ti@xmath100c@xmath101 also has a strong band at @xmath116@xmath0 ; van heijnsbergen et al .",
