    "recently fully microscopic calculations of nuclei with @xmath4 have become feasible @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0be nucleus is such a system of special interest , as it allows tests of theories of interaction of composite particles @xcite .",
    "the properties of low  energy continuum of @xmath0be are of particular importance in this connection . however , the corresponding experimental data on the low  energy photodisintegration of @xmath0be are not in mutual agreement ( see fig .  1 ) . in the present work we develop a semi  microscopic model to describe the process , and we analyze the experimental data with its help .",
    "the model accounts simultaneously for both resonant and non  resonant contributions to the cross section .",
    "an estimation of the reliability of various data is obtained and a theoretical photodisintegration cross section is derived .",
    "we also calculate the reaction rates of the reaction @xmath0be@xmath5 and the reverse reaction for astrophysical conditions .",
    "these reaction rates are of relevance in the high  entropy bubble in type ii supernovae , an astrophysical site that has been suggested for the r  process @xcite . the baryonic matter in this bubble is dominated in the beginning by @xmath6particles , neutrons , and protons .",
    "the abundance distribution shifts then to higher masses through the recombination of the free @xmath6particles , neutrons , and protons .",
    "this generates the so  called @xmath6process leading to the formation of massive isotopes ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the reaction path in the @xmath6process is mainly determined by requirements of nuclear statistical equilibrium and depends also on the reaction rates of the various recombination paths bridging the mass 5 and 8 gaps .",
    "it has been shown that there are three principal reaction paths from @xmath8he to @xmath9c : + ( i ) @xmath8he(2@xmath6,@xmath10)@xmath9c + ( ii ) @xmath8he(@xmath6 n,@xmath10)@xmath0be(@xmath6,n)@xmath9c + ( iii ) @xmath8he(2n,@xmath10)@xmath11he(@xmath6,n)@xmath0be(@xmath6,n)@xmath9c .",
    "it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that the triple  alpha process ( i ) can be neglected compared to the reaction sequence ( ii ) via @xmath0be under r  process conditions in the @xmath6process . also the reaction path ( iii ) via @xmath11he",
    "can be neglected for this scenario @xcite .",
    "this is true even if the reaction rate of @xmath8he(2n,@xmath10)@xmath11he is strongly enhanced  @xcite , because then @xmath11he is also destroyed very effectively through photodissociation .",
    "therefore , for the @xmath6 and r  process the reaction @xmath8he(@xmath6 n,@xmath10)@xmath0be plays a key role in bridging the unstable mass gaps at @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the reaction rates of @xmath8he(@xmath6 n,@xmath10)@xmath0be and the reverse photodisintegration of @xmath0be were estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite from the experimental photodisintegration cross section",
    ". however , ref .",
    "@xcite did not include information on which experimental data their estimate was based .",
    "in view of the astrophysical relevance of these reactions we recalculate in the present work the rates of the first step of the reaction ( ii ) above .    the same problem is also addressed in ref .",
    "these authors obtain the resonant contribution to the @xmath0be@xmath14be cross section from the breit  wigner formula for the first excited state of @xmath0be with the parameters taken from ref .",
    "@xcite . and",
    "@xmath15 parameters of the resonance used in ref .",
    "@xcite seem to be incorrect .",
    "the resonant properties of the @xmath16 state of @xmath0be will be considered in our future work . ] in order to calculate the non  resonant contribution they introduce a single  particle potential with the depth chosen to reproduce the ground state , calculate both ground and final  state continuum wave functions in this potential , and multiply the cross section obtained by the shell  model spectroscopic factor .",
    "they then add this cross section constructively or destructively to the resonant cross section to establish possible upper and lower bounds for the reaction rates .",
    "this procedure has certain shortcomings : a resonant contribution to the cross section should not emerge as an addition to the dynamic model used , since a correct quantum mechanical model should necessarily contain such a contribution itself , along with the non  resonant contribution and an interference term . besides",
    ", the potential wells used for the ground state and continuum state should in fact be different : an additional spin  orbit potential , for example , should be present in the ground p  state as compared to the continuum s  state .",
    "in our model we use a three - body specification of the @xmath0be bound state , and a semimicroscopic continuum wave function which describes the essential scattering degrees of freedom at low relative energies . in sect .  2 this model",
    "is formulated . in sect .",
    "3 the results for the @xmath0be@xmath17 cross section are given . in sect .",
    "4 the astrophysical rates for @xmath3be@xmath2 and the reverse reaction are calculated .",
    "the relevant experimental data on the low  energy @xmath0be@xmath17 cross section are presented in fig .  1 .",
    "the available data are those in @xcite obtained with bremsstrahlung photons and those in @xcite obtained from @xmath10radiation from radioactive isotopes .",
    "the peak at very low energy exhibited by the data of ref .",
    "@xcite is not confirmed by other groups , and may arise from discrepancies caused by neutron energy loss in the targets @xcite .",
    "the radioactive isotope techniques normally provide more reliable results due to the absence of difficulties with the energy resolution .",
    "however , the cross section can be determined only for a few discrete photon energies with this method .",
    "this drawback will be cured below by the use of an appropriate theoretical model",
    ". our strategy will be thus to analyze the radioactive isotope data .",
    "we shall consider the range of energies up to 0.5mev above threshold .",
    "we need to obtain the ground state and continuum wave functions ( wf ) and calculate the transition matrix element .",
    "we start with the three",
    " body @xmath18 representation of the @xmath0be system . within this representation",
    "the wf in the c.m .",
    "system is the @xmath19 relative motion function times the intrinsic wfs of the two @xmath6particles . since a predominant contribution to the transition matrix element comes from distances large compared to the size of the @xmath6particle additional antisymmetrization",
    "may be disregarded .",
    "system @xcite , for example . ] the intrinsic @xmath6 particle wfs then will drop out from the calculation . in the following",
    "we shall refer to the three  particle relative motion function as to the wf of the system .",
    "let us denote and @xmath20 the distance between the @xmath6 particles and that from their center of mass to the neutron , respectively .",
    "the ground state is @xmath21 , and its wf is of the form @xmath22_l\\chi_{1/2}]_j .",
    "\\label{eq : gswf}\\ ] ] here @xmath23 is the neutron spin function , and the brackets @xmath24 $ ] stand for angular momentum coupling . because of the pauli principle and parity requirements @xmath25 is even , and @xmath26 is odd .",
    "the wf in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gswf ] ) was obtained from the three  body schrdinger equation with @xmath27 and @xmath28 potentials reproducing the observed two  body phase shifts .",
    "these potentials , along with some details of the calculation , are listed in the appendix .",
    "practically an exact solution to the @xmath18 bound state problem is obtained , but one can not get the experimental binding energy with these `` bare '' interparticle interactions .",
    "a possible reason is that the two @xmath6particles may distort each other in the @xmath18 bound state compared to the pure @xmath29 case .",
    "this may lead to a change in the @xmath29 interaction . to obtain a reasonable ground state",
    "wf the strength of the attractive central component of the @xmath29 potential is reduced by 8% in our calculation .",
    "this leads to values of 1.50mev and 2.48fm for the binding energy and charge radius of @xmath0be , sufficiently close to the experimental values of 1.5736mev and ( @xmath30)fm .",
    "coming to the continuum wave function , we note first that the @xmath31be resonance produced in the reaction may be safely treated as a stable particle for the purposes of our calculation .",
    "this is because its width of 7kev is extremely narrow on a nuclear scale .",
    "the @xmath27 continuum wave function , taken at the resonance energy and normalized to unity in the interior region , decreases practically to zero in the coulomb barrier region as shown in fig .  2 ( solid line ) .",
    "this function represents the wf of the resonance extremely well and is taken as the @xmath31be `` bound state '' wave function .",
    "second , we argue that photodisintegration of @xmath0be proceeds entirely into the @xmath31be@xmath32 channel . indeed , one can estimate that , at small energies considered , the three ",
    "fragment @xmath18 disintegration channel is strongly suppressed due to the threshold regime .",
    "the experimental data also strongly supports the absence of this channel @xcite . at the same time ,",
    "fragment @xmath8he@xmath33he channel is still closed and ineffective due to the broad width of @xmath34he .",
    "thus our cross section starts from the @xmath31be@xmath32 threshold of 1.6654mev .",
    "the cross section in the region between this threshold and the @xmath19 threshold of 1.5736mev is known to be tiny @xcite and will be disregarded . as in the previous work ( e.g. @xcite )",
    "we confine ourselves to an s  wave relative @xmath35be motion , i.e. , with @xmath16 continuum states .",
    "predictions of the above dynamic @xmath19 model for the photodisintegration of @xmath0be depend crucially on the position of the excited state of @xmath0be with respect to the threshold .",
    "preliminary three  body calculations gave us a peak lying too high in energy , and too broad .",
    "this could not be used for a reasonable fit to the data , so in the following we shall formulate an alternative representation of the continuum wf .",
    "we shall seek it in the form @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the intrinsic wave function of @xmath31be calculated with the same @xmath27 potential as for the ground state , and @xmath38 is the @xmath35be relative motion function , where for large @xmath39 the normalization @xmath40 is used .",
    "generally speaking , the true continuum wave function differs from eq .",
    "( [ eq : cwf ] ) not only in the @xmath35be interaction region but also in the outer region .",
    "however , at energies in the vicinity of the long  living excited state of @xmath0be the representation ( [ eq : cwf ] ) should approximately be valid in the outer region .",
    "indeed , the decay of the long  living state into the three ",
    "body @xmath19 channel is inhibited due to the threshold regime . due to the approximate validity of the wf in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cwf ] ) in the outer region one obtains a correct energy dependence of the cross section when using this wf . for small energies the main energy dependence of the transition matrix element appears as a factor in the continuum wf and",
    "is determined by an outer part of the wf , i.e. the phase shift .",
    "besides , one can see below that just the outer region ( where @xmath38 takes the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sin ] ) ) gives the biggest contribution to the transition matrix element .",
    "one can therefore hope that a wf of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cwf ] ) suffices for the fitting purpose in the whole energy range considered .",
    "we seek the relative motion function @xmath38 as a solution to the relative motion schrdinger equation with some potential whose parameters are chosen from a fit of the theoretical cross section to the data .",
    "taking into account that the s ",
    "wave @xmath28 repulsion and the p  wave @xmath28 attraction have comparable ranges one can assume a smooth attractive potential .",
    "the woods ",
    "saxon family @xmath41 will be adopted below as a good representative .",
    "consider now the representation of the photodisintegration cross section in our model .",
    "the matrix element of the dipole transition operator @xmath42 between the wfs in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gswf ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : cwf ] ) has to be calculated . after integrating over @xmath43 the matrix element",
    "reduces to the overlap between the @xmath35be relative motion functions , namely the scattering function entering eq .",
    "( [ eq : cwf ] ) and the `` effective bound state wf '' @xmath44_{j=3/2}\\ ] ] obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : gswf ] ) : @xmath45    using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cwf ] ) , ( [ eq : eff ] ) the cross section is of the same form as in the single  particle case . the total ( s  wave ) photodisintegration cross section is calculated in the simple form @xmath46 here @xmath47 is the @xmath35be reduced mass , and @xmath48 is the excitation energy @xmath49 that will be denoted as @xmath50 below . in case of a single  particle description of the process , i.e. , the `` valence neutron '' model , eq .",
    "( [ eq : crs ] ) is valid with the bound  state wf normalized to unity , while in our case ( see below ) @xmath51 it is implied here and in eq .",
    "( [ eq : crs ] ) that the @xmath31be and @xmath0be ground state wave functions are normalized to unity .",
    "the function @xmath52 is shown in fig .  2 ( dashed line ) .",
    "in ref .  @xcite the data at the energies up to 185kev above threshold ( @xmath53 mev ) from refs .",
    "@xcite were reproduced at a qualitative level within the following framework . the valence neutron model with woods ",
    "saxon type potentials was used .",
    "the results obtained in this way were multiplied by some constant factors less than unity , so called `` reduction factors '' , to approach the experimental cross section . to obtain the continuum wave function the depth of the potential",
    "was varied while the radius and diffuseness parameters were taken the same as for the central component of the potential in the bound state calculation .",
    "two fits were found , one with a reduction factor of 0.53 leading to a weakly bound @xmath31be@xmath32 @xmath16 state , and the other one with a reduction factor of 0.31 leading to a virtual state . the first possibility was once preferred in view of the results of ref .",
    "@xcite . in that work a two channel @xmath31be@xmath32 model of the ground state of @xmath0be",
    "was introduced to cure the single  particle description @xcite of photodisintegration .",
    "the @xmath31be subsystem was allowed to be in the ground and first excited state , and that led to the reduction factor of 0.5 or 0.6 in the cross section depending on the assumptions . in ref .",
    "@xcite the reduction factor of 0.56 was found for that model .",
    "in contrast to ref . @xcite our results below definitely testify to a virtual @xmath31be@xmath32 @xmath16 state .",
    "this is probably due to a more realistic treatment of the ground state of @xmath0be in our model .",
    "in fact the reduction factors obtained in the two  channel model of the ground state of @xmath0be @xcite should be used in conjunction with the channel coupling n@xmath54be dynamics , instead of using @xcite single  channel dynamics . in ref .",
    "@xcite the same data were fitted with the line shape @xmath55 .",
    "this shape was derived incorrectly from the breit  wigner cross section under the assumption that the @xmath16 level of @xmath0be is a bound or virtual @xmath31be@xmath32 state . in ref .",
    "@xcite the data of ref .",
    "@xcite were fitted with a one  level r ",
    "matrix approximation .",
    "the fit leads to a complex  energy resonant state @xcite and the real part of the complex energy proves to be negative .",
    "first we shall analyze the data of refs .",
    "@xcite ( full circles , full squares , and full diamond in fig .",
    "1 ) . a search of the parameters @xmath56 , @xmath39 , and @xmath57 of the potential ( [ eq : ws ] ) giving an acceptable fit to the data is performed .",
    "several local minima of the quantity @xmath58 in the space of the parameters are found .",
    "one of them is provided by @xmath59 these values seem to be very reasonable . for this",
    "set the @xmath60(degrees of freedom ) value equals 0.62 .",
    "another one is obtained with the parameters @xmath61 giving @xmath62 .",
    "several other minima also exist with sizable higher but still acceptable @xmath63 values . in fig .",
    "3 the photodisintegration cross sections obtained with the parameters ( [ eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:2 ] ) are shown as the solid and dashed curve , respectively .",
    "the two cross sections prove to be quite close to each other .",
    "to clarify partially the reason for this we note that the biggest contribution to the matrix element of eq .",
    "( [ eq : int ] ) comes from the distances beyond the range of the potential . the distances larger than 5 fm in eq .",
    "( [ eq : int ] ) provide 60 - 70% contribution to the cross section , and at such distances the wave functions deviate from the asymptotic ones , eq .",
    "( [ eq : sin ] ) , by not more than 10% ( except for regions in the vicinity of zeros ) .",
    "the asymptotic wave functions are determined by the phase shifts i.e. , predominantly by the scattering length @xmath57 and the effective range @xmath64 .",
    "therefore the procedure is equivalent to some degree to fitting @xmath57 and @xmath64 values .",
    "once this is done , the cross sections are not very dependent on the particular set of the potential parameters . the @xmath57 and @xmath64 values are @xmath65fm and @xmath66fm , respectively , for the set ( [ eq:1 ] ) , and @xmath67fm and @xmath68fm for the set ( [ eq:2 ] ) .",
    "all the other above mentioned sets of potential parameters giving local minima to @xmath63 lead to very similar @xmath57 and @xmath64 values .",
    "however considerable changes in the scattering wf inside the potential can influence the results , see the next paragraph .",
    "the following way to interpolate between the data has also been tried .",
    "let us denote by @xmath69 the cross section obtained in case when the right  hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sin ] ) is used as a continuum wave function for all @xmath39 values .",
    "this cross section has been calculated taking @xmath70 from the effective range expansion with the @xmath57 and @xmath64 values given by the potential ( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "let us represent @xmath71 as @xmath72 and fit @xmath73 to experiment .",
    "it is hoped that , in contrast to @xmath71 , the factor @xmath73 behaves in a smooth way and thus can be reliably obtained from an interpolation procedure .",
    "indeed , the behavior of both @xmath71 and @xmath74 can be approximately described by the resonant factor @xmath75 times a slowly varying function .",
    "even a fit with @xmath76 proves to provide a sufficiently low @xmath63 value .",
    "the cross section obtained with this @xmath77 is shown in fig .  3 as the dotted curve .",
    "presumably this procedure provides less accurate results than the previous one .",
    "of course , the energy dependence @xmath75 is not accurate enough in the whole energy range , as a comparison with the exact solution for the potential ( [ eq:1 ] ) shows",
    ". hence @xmath73 should include an energy dependence , but this could not be determined because of experimental uncertainties .",
    "next we applied the procedure to the data of ref .",
    "@xcite ( open circles in fig .",
    "1 ) . three local minima with acceptable @xmath63 values are found .",
    "however the parameters of the potential corresponding to all of them : @xmath78 prove to be rather unrealistic .",
    "there exists one more difference between these potentials and those in eqs .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:2 ] ) .",
    "the latter potentials , as well as the other potentials ( [ eq : ws ] ) providing a good fit to the same data , support one deeply bound state and one state close to being bound . on the contrary , the potentials ( [ fu ] ) support only one very weakly bound state .",
    "an existence of one deeply bound @xmath79 level in the neutron mean field in the @xmath0be nucleus , or , equivalently , one node in the low  energy scattering wave function inside the potential , seems to be natural from the shell  model point of view .",
    "we think this point of view is sufficient to establish the correct number of nodes for the neutron motion inside the woods ",
    "saxon potential , even for such a clusterized system . in the @xmath6particle oscillator model of @xmath0be @xcite ,",
    "for example , the first allowed neutron @xmath79state contains a substantial admixture of the nodeless @xmath80 function , but this leads not to a disappearance but only to a shift of the node . if one admits that the state considered is a mixture of @xmath80 and @xmath81 oscillator functions then there exists just one node located within the distance of 3 fm from the origin .",
    "therefore we conclude that in the region where various data sets differ from each other the older radioactive isotope data are preferable .",
    "we also note that the cross section we obtain with potentials ( [ eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:2 ] ) for the highest energies considered , being lower than the fitted datum of ref .",
    "@xcite , agrees well with the bremsstrahlung jacobson data @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0be@xmath82 reaction rate per nucleus per time unit is calculated via the usual averaging the elementary photodisintegration cross section @xmath83 with the approximate , or wien distribution for the photon density , @xmath84 where @xmath85 mev .",
    "the rate of the reverse reaction ( the number of reactions per time unit per unit volume ) is @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are numbers of particles per unit volume .",
