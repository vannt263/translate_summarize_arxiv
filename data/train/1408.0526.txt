    "quantum mechanics ( qm ) is , certainly , the most successful theory to describe physical phenomena at very small scales .",
    "apart from gravity , it provides completely correct mathematical description for all natural phenomena , stating from the structure of atoms , the rules of chemistry and properties of condensed matter to nuclear structure and the physics of elementary particles .",
    "however , from a fundamental point of view different concepts of this theory departs in various ways from that of classical physics .",
    "undoubtedly the most debatable _ non classical _ concept is the existence of _ nonlocal _ correlations among spatially separated quantum systems .",
    "john bell , a northern irish physicist , in 1964 , established a seminal result , that certain quantum correlations , unlike all other correlations in the universe , can not arise from any local cause @xcite .",
    "this result is commonly known as ` bell s theorem ' . for the last @xmath0 years",
    ", this theorem remains at the center of almost all _ metaphysical _ debates of quantum foundation and during the last two decades it also finds applications in various information theoretic tasks .    in his paper bell",
    "addressed a long standing question introduced by einstein along with his two colleagues podolsky and rosen ( epr ) at the very early days of quantum theory @xcite . from historical perspective , einstein was the most prominent opponent of the ` copenhagen interpretation ' , according to which quantum system is completely described by a wave function belonging to an hilbert space associated with the system @xcite .",
    "he believed that the fundamental theory of the nature must be deterministic .",
    "it was the intrinsic randomness of qm ( lack of reality ) which bothered him the most .",
    "his dissatisfaction with qm , in describing the natural phenomena , comes clear from one of his famous comment `` _ _ god does not play dice with the universe _ _ '' . in his view , though qm provide the correct description of physical phenomena it could not be the complete one . in the groundbreaking @xmath1 epr paper",
    "this philosophical idea has been condensed into a physical argument . in this paper",
    "the authors first described a necessary condition of completeness for a physical theory :    1 .",
    "* condition of completeness * : _ every element of the physical reality must have a counter part in the physical theory_.    once the the condition of completeness is given , naturally the question arises : ` what are the elements of the physical reality ? '",
    "epr did not provide a comprehensive definition of reality , but , they described a sufficient condition of it :    1 .",
    "* physical reality * : _ if , without in any way disturbing a system , we can predict with certainty ( i.e. , with probability equal to unity ) the value of a physical quantity , then there exists an element of physical reality corresponding lo this physical quantity . _    invoking , then , the well established idea from special theory of relativity , that nothing can travel faster than light , epr succeed to demonstrate that `` _ _ wave function does not provide a complete description of the physical reality _ _ '' .",
    "epr ended there paper in the following fashion `` _ _ .... we left open the question of whether or not such a description exists .",
    "we believe , however , that such a theory is possible _ _ '' . epr work immediately gave rise to intense debates among physicists as well as philosophers about the foundational status of qm . within few days , an important critique appeared by n. bohr , a pioneer proponent of the copenhagen interpretation , against the epr argument @xcite .",
    "but , for a long period of time the debate was only a subject of theoretical interest , no empirical testable method was known to resolve this debate .",
    "john bell took the challenge whether some experimental criteria can be derived to address this debate and ultimately in @xmath2 he succeeded to derive it as an powerful theorem .",
    "this theorem tells that there exist quantum correlations which are incompatible with conjunction of two classical notion , namely , _",
    "locality _ and _ reality_. however , later it has been shown that the same bell s theorem can be derived under different sets of assumptions .",
    "violation of this theorem implies different consequences depending on under which set of assumptions the theorem is derived .",
    "this paper is organized in the following manner . in section ( [ sec2 ] )",
    "we first discuss operational and ontological framework for any physical theory .",
    "we then discuss the bell s original derivation of his famous inequality under the assumptions of _ locality _ and _ reality_. we also discuss about the quantum mechanical violation of this inequality . in section ( [ sec3 ] )",
    "we discuss that bell s inequality ( bi ) can be derived under the assumption of joint measurability and relativistic causality or no signaling principle . in section ( [ sec4 ] )",
    "we analyze that the same bi can be derived under some operational assumptions .",
    "we also discuss that as a novel implication of this derivation bi finds application in an important information theoretic task , namely device independent randomness certification . in section ( [ sec5 ] )",
    "we discuss another important feature of quantum correlation namely the limited violation of bi in qm compared to the violation allowed by no - signaling principle .",
    "we discuss the role of uncertainty and complementarity principle in explaining this feature .",
    "bell realized that to understand the source of conflicts in qm , it is essential to know where and how our classical concepts and intuitions start to fail in describing the quantum phenomena .",
    "he succeeded to derive an experimentally testable condition obtained under some _ metaphysical _ assumptions which follow from the classical world view .",
    "for the first time , in the history of science , there was a concrete suggestion to test the correctness of different world view from measurement results .",
    "this area of study is called ` _ _ experimental metaphysics _ _ ' , a term coined by abner shimony @xcite . before discussing various assumptions under which bi is derived ,",
    "we briefly describe the _ operational _ and _ ontological _ framework for any physical theory .      in an operational interpretation of a physical theory ,",
    "the primitive elements are preparation procedures , transformation procedures , and measurement procedures , which can be viewed as lists of instructions to be implemented in the laboratory .",
    "the goal of an operational theory is merely to specify the probabilities @xmath3 of different outcomes @xmath4 that may result from a measurement procedure @xmath5 given a particular preparation procedure @xmath6 , and a particular transformation procedure @xmath7 ; where @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively denote the sets of measurement procedures , preparation procedures and transformation procedures ; @xmath11 denotes the set of measurement results for the measurement m. when there is no transformation procedure , we simply have @xmath12 .",
    "the only restrictions on @xmath13 is that all of them are non negative and @xmath14 @xmath15 m , p. as an example , in an operational formulation of quantum theory , every preparation p is associated with a density operator @xmath16 on hilbert space , and every measurement m is associated with a positive operator valued measure ( povm ) @xmath17 .",
    "the probability of obtaining outcome @xmath18 is given by the generalized born rule , @xmath19 .",
    "an operational theory does not tell anything about _ physical state _ of the system .",
    "so one can construct an ontological model of an operational theory ( for details of this framework , we refer to @xcite ) .      in an ontological model of an operational theory",
    "the primitives of description are the actual state of affairs of the system .",
    "a preparation procedure is assumed to prepare a system with certain properties and a measurement procedure is assumed to reveal something about those properties . a complete specification of the properties of a system is referred to as the ontic state of that system",
    ". the knowledge of the ontic state may remain unknown to the observer . for this reason it is also called hidden variable and the model",
    "is called hidden variable theory ( hvt ) .    in an ontological model for quantum theory , a particular preparation method @xmath20 which prepares the quantum state @xmath21 , actually puts the system into some ontic state @xmath22",
    ", @xmath23 denotes the ontic state space .",
    "an observer who knows the preparation @xmath20 may nonetheless have incomplete knowledge of @xmath24 .",
    "thus , in general , an ontological model associates a probability distribution @xmath25 with preparation @xmath20 of @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath26 is called the _ epistemic state _ as it encodes observer s _ epistemic ignorance _ about the state of the system .",
    "it must satisfy @xmath27 similarly , the model may be such that the ontic state @xmath24 determines only the probability @xmath28 , of different outcomes @xmath18 for the measurement method @xmath29 . however , when the model is deterministic one , @xmath30",
    ". the response functions @xmath31 $ ] , should satisfy @xmath32 as the model is required to reproduce the observed frequencies ( quantum predictions ) hence the following must also be satisfied @xmath33 this requirement is called ` quantum reproducibility condition ' .",
    "it is a statement about certain type of correlations established between two spatially separated observers , say alice and bob .",
    "each of the observers hold some physical system which may have interacted previously .",
    "denote the preparation state of the composite system as @xmath34 .",
    "both of them perform measurement on there respective subsystem and observe the measurement result .",
    "let , alice can choose to perform any of two possible measurements @xmath35 . also consider that for each measurement there are two possible outcomes denoted as @xmath36 .",
    "similarly , bob measurements are denoted as @xmath37 and the outcome as @xmath38 .",
    "now for any pair of alice s and bob s measurement settings the expectation value is calculated as @xmath39 where the subindex @xmath40 denote that expectation is calculated on the preparation state @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath41 are the observed frequency in the operational theory , where @xmath42 denote the joint conditional probability of obtaining outcome ` @xmath43 ' by alice and outcome ` @xmath44 ' by bob when they perform measurements ` @xmath45 ' and ` @xmath46 ' respectively . for this operational experiment",
    "one can consider a ontological model as described previously . denoting the ontological variable ( hidden variable ) as @xmath24",
    ", the conditional joint probability reads as @xmath47 . to satisfy the reproducibility condition ( [ reproduce ] )",
    "we have @xmath48 the assumptions under which bell derived his result state certain properties of the ontological theory .    _ * definition 1 * _ : an ontological model is said to satisfy locality iff @xmath49[locality ]    _ * definition 2 * _ : an ontological model is said to deterministic iff it satisfy determinism iff @xmath50 this implies that @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "it is straightforward to check that if any model satisfy locality and determinism then it also satisfy the following factorisability relation @xmath53    * theorem 1 * ( bell ) : any theory which satisfy the factorisability condition or in other words satisfy locality and determinism must satisfy the following inequality : @xmath54 . in other word ,",
    "applying bay s theorem , we can say that alice s ( bob s ) choices of measurement setting is independent of the ontic variables , i.e. , alice and bob can choose their measurement setting freely .",
    "interestingly , quantum statistics violates this inequality . in the following we discuss regarding the violation of bi in qm .",
    "consider two spin - half particle prepared in the state @xmath55 , where sub - indices have been used to denote first and second particle respectively , and @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) denotes the up ( down ) eigenstate of the pauli @xmath58 operator .",
    "the state @xmath59 is called singlet state and it belongs to the tensor product hilbert space @xmath60 .",
    "this state has an interesting property that it can not be written as mixer of product states of the composite system and hence it is entangled @xcite . if alice perform spin measurement along @xmath61 direction and bob perform along @xmath62 direction on their respective particle of singlet state then according to qm the joint expectation reads as : @xmath63 let alice and bob fix there measurement setting as following : @xmath64 and @xmath65 . with these measurement settings on singlet sate the bell inequality expression ( i.e. left hand side of eq.([bi ] ) ) turns out to be @xmath66 ( loophole free experimental verification of nonlocal nature of qm is an active area of research till date @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting question to ask what conclusion one can draw from bi violation . as in the previous section",
    "we have discussed that bi is derived under the assumption of locality and determinism , so when a theory violates bi we conclude that the description of the theory can not be replaced by an local deterministic ontological model .",
    "since qm violates bi , it can not have a local deterministic description and hence it is called _ nonlocal_. note that to show the violation of bi in qm the measurements that have been chosen on alice s ( bob s ) side are incompatible _ i.e",
    "_ not jointly measurable . in the following section we discuss the connection between incompatibility of observables and bi violation",
    "to show the violation of bi in qm we have used two feature of quantum theory , i.e. , we have considered ( i ) entangled system and ( ii ) incompatible measurement .",
    "naturally the question arise whether these two feature are generic requirement for bi violation in qm .",
    "it has been shown that by performing arbitrary local measurements on a separable state it is not possible to establish any form of quantum nonlocality @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , if we want to address the question of incompatible observable , we have to put more general the notion of incompatibility .",
    "there are several notions of incompatibility .",
    "two such notions are non - commutativity and non existence of joint measurement @xcite . for projective measurement ( pvm )",
    "these two notions are identical .",
    "_ have shown that bi can be derived under the assumption of existence of joint measurement and no signaling or signal locality condition @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that if joint measurement exists on both side then the four probability distribution exists and the bi follows according to fine s result @xcite . in the following we briefly sketch",
    "the proof of andersson _ et al .",
    "_    consider two measurements @xmath67 and @xmath68 on alice side and two measurements @xmath69 and @xmath70 on bob s side .",
    "denote @xmath71 $ ] be the probability that @xmath67 and @xmath68 have same measurement outcome when bob s measurement is @xmath72 .",
    "we have @xmath73=p[v(a_1)=v(a_2)=v(b)]+p[v(a_1)=v(a_2)=-v(b)].\\ ] ] positivity condition of the probability implies , @xmath74+p[v(a_1)=v(a_2)=-v(b)]\\ ] ] @xmath75-p[v(a_1)=v(a_2)=-v(b)]|.\\ ] ] writing the expectation value as @xmath76-p[v(a)=-v(b)]\\ ] ] and putting @xmath77 we have @xmath78\\ge\\frac{1}{2}|e(a_1,b_1)+e(a_1,b_2)|\\ ] ] similar argument gives @xmath79\\ge\\frac{1}{2}|e(a_1,b_2)-e(a_2,b_2)|\\ ] ] adding the above two inequalities we have @xmath78+p[v(a_1)=-v(a_2);b_2]\\ ] ] @xmath80 the no signaling condition implies @xmath79=p[v(a_1)=-v(a_2);b_1].\\ ] ] using the normalization of probability , @xmath78+p[v(a_1)=-v(a_2);b_1]=1\\ ] ] finally we get @xmath81    however , for positive - operator - valued - measures ( povms ) non existence of joint measurability and non - commutativity are not equivalent notions",
    ". from now on incompatibility would mean the impossibility of joint measurement .",
    "so , at this point one can asks the following two questions : ( 1 ) do all entangled states demonstrate nonlocality ?",
    "( 2 ) can all pair of incompatible measurements on both sides exhibit nonlocality ?",
    "it has been shown that though all pure entanglement states violates bi @xcite , there exist mixed entangled states which have lhv model for all pvms @xcite and also for all povms @xcite , which means there exist local entangled states or in other words , nonlocality and entanglement are two different concepts",
    ". if two incompatible measurements are considered , each with binary outcome , then wolf et al .",
    "have shown that it can always lead to violation of the bell - clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( bell - chsh ) @xcite inequality @xcite .",
    "this result has established a connection between ( im)possibility of joint measurability and nonlocality . however , for general situation i.e. , for arbitrary number of povms with arbitrarily many outcomes the relation between joint measurability and nonlocality is not yet established .",
    "the question is important as pairwise joint measurability , in general , does not imply full joint measurability .",
    "we discuss two different such examples .",
    "\\(a ) _ * orthogonal spin measurement * _ : consider the set of three dichotomic povms , acting on @xmath82 , given by the following positive operators @xmath83 for @xmath84 , where @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath58 are the pauli matrices , and @xmath87 .",
    "the operator corresponding to other outcome is @xmath88 .",
    "the triple of measurements are pairwise jointly measurable iff @xmath89 , but triple - wise jointly measurable iff @xmath90 . hence in the range @xmath91 the the set @xmath92 forms a hollow triangle @xcite .",
    "\\(b ) _ * trine spin measurement * _ : consider another three dichotomic povms , acting on @xmath82 , given by @xmath93 where , the three vectors @xmath94 are equally separated in a plane , i.e. separated by a trine or an angle of @xmath95",
    ". this triple of measurements are pairwise jointly measurable if @xmath96 , but triple - wise jointly measurable only if @xmath97 @xcite .",
    "the above two example shows that the connection between joint measurability and nonlocality for more than two measurement scenario , even with each measurement being dichotomic , is not a trivial extension of that of two measurement scenario .",
    "in two recent works partial but very useful progress has been obtained @xcite .",
    "the authors in @xcite showed that ( non ) joint measurability can be viewed as equivalent to epr steering , a strictly weaker type of nonlocality than bell s nonlocality @xcite .",
    "specifically , the authors in @xcite have shown that for any set of povms that are incompatible ( i.e. not jointly measurable ) , one can find an entangled state , such that the resulting statistics violates a steering inequality .",
    "they further conjectured that ( im)possibility of joint measurability and bell nonlocality are inequivalent .",
    "a conclusive answer requires proof ( or disproof ) of this conjecture .",
    "other than these foundational implications , in the last decade various device - independent @xcite information theoretic protocols like cryptography @xcite , randomness certification @xcite , hilbert spaces dimension witness @xcite have made use of nonlocality arguments @xcite . in the following we discuss one of such protocol , namely , device independent randomness certification . before",
    "that we discuss another derivation of bi based on some _ operational _ assumptions .",
    "in the previous section we have seen that bi can be derived under the conjunction of two assumption , namely , _",
    "locality _ and _ determinism_. both these assumptions assert some _ ontological _ properties .",
    "as qm violates bi , it can not have a local - deterministic ontological description . however , there are models that violate locality but maintain determinism ( bohmian mechanics @xcite is an example ) , and models that maintain locality but violate determinism ( standard operational quantum theory is an example ) .",
    "recently , cavalcanti and wiseman have derived bi from another set of assumptions , namely , _ signal locality _ and _ predictability _ @xcite . unlike the bell",
    "original assumptions ( i.e. locality and determinism ) , these assumptions are purely operational , that is , they refer to operational quantities only . whereas the assumption of signal locality describe the impossibility to send signals faster than light",
    ", predictability assumes that one can predict the outcomes of all possible measurements to be performed on a system .",
    "to derive bi from the conjunction of the assumptions signal locality and predictability it is sufficient to show that the joint probabilities of experimental outcomes given by a model is factorisable , i.e. , satisfy the eq.([facto ] ) .",
    "_ * definition 3 * _ : a model is said to satisfy signal locality iff @xmath98    _ * definition 4 * _ : a model is said to be predictable , or to satisfy predictability iff @xmath99 this implies that @xmath100 and @xmath101 .    * lemma 1 * ( cavalcanti & wiseman ) : signal locality @xmath102 predictability @xmath103 bi .    _",
    "proof _ : the definition of predictability implies that @xmath104 as @xmath105 , conditioning on @xmath24 can not alter it .",
    "using bay s rule of conditional probability @xmath106 predictability also implies that @xmath107 .",
    "hence @xmath108 applying the signal locality condition @xmath109 conditioning on the ontic variable @xmath24 , we reached at the desired factorisable condition given by @xmath110    the above derivation gives authority in drawing remarkable conclusion from bi violation .",
    "since signal locality is an empirically testable ( and well - tested ) consequence of relativity , violation of bi would imply unpredictability .",
    "this understanding actually plays the fundamental role in an important information theoretic protocol , namely , device independent randomness certification , a pioneer work done by pironio et al . @xcite . before describing the work of pironio _ et al .",
    "_ we first briefly discuss the framework of device independent scenario .",
    "the necessity of device independent technique in quantum information processing tasks was pointed out by a. acn _",
    "they observed that in the bb84 quantum key distribution ( qkd ) protocol @xcite the security proof was based on    * the validity of the quantum formalism , * the legitimate partners perfectly know how their correlation is established , e.g. , they know the dimensions of the hilbert space describing their quantum systems .",
    "the security proofs of qkd schemes exploit the well - established quantum features such as the no - cloning theorem , or the monogamy ( i.e. , nonshareability ) of of certain quantum correlations .",
    "but if there is no restriction on the hilbert space dimension , the security proof breaks down . in the noise - free case ,",
    "the bb84 correlation satisfies @xmath111 and @xmath112 . if such correlation results from measurements in the @xmath45 and @xmath113 bases on qubit pairs , then the state of these two qubits is necessarily maximally entangled and security follows from monogamy of entanglement . however , the authors , in @xcite , pointed out that the same correlation can also be reproduced by the following four - qubit state : @xmath114 here , alice holds the first and third qubit .",
    "whenever she measures in the @xmath113 ( @xmath45 ) basis , she is actually measuring the first ( third ) qubit in this basis .",
    "the same happens for bob , with the second and fourth qubit .",
    "it is easy to verify that the correlation is precisely same as ideal bb84 case .",
    "as the state is separable , so a secure key can not be established . thus key distribution in these schemes is successful when assumption ( ii ) is satisfied .",
    "in device independent scenario one does not have detail knowledge about the experimental apparatus , i.e. , the experimental set up is like a black - box as shown in fig([pic1 ] ) . on each side ,",
    "the experimental device is depicted like a box with some knobs . a knob with different positions on each device , denoted respectively by @xmath115 and @xmath116 , allows alice and bob to change the parameters of each measuring apparatus .",
    "each measurement performed by alice and bob has @xmath117 possible outcomes .",
    "finally , the frequencies @xmath118 of occurrence of a given pair of outcomes for each pair of measurements have to be collected .",
    "then it has to be checked whether the correlation satisfy some established physical principles .",
    "only if it fulfills the required conditions , the correlation can be used for secure protocols . in the following we discuss such a device independent task , namely , device independent randomness certification .      in di randomness certification scenario one ( say alice ) has a private place which is completely inaccessible from outside i.e. , no illegitimate system may enter in this place . from a cryptographic point of view assumption of such private place",
    "is admissible .",
    "alice choses classical inputs @xmath119 and @xmath120 with probability distributions @xmath121 and @xmath122 , respectively , and sends them to two measurement devices ( @xmath123 and @xmath124 respectively ) through some secure classical communication channels .",
    "the inputs prescribe the measurement devices to perform some povm @xmath125 and @xmath126 on some quantum state @xmath16 , shared between the two devices .",
    "once the inputs are received , no classical communication between the measurement devices @xmath123 and @xmath124 is allowed .",
    "alice collects the input - output statistics @xmath127 .",
    "and @xmath124 ) through secure classical channels .",
    "classical communication is not allowed between two measurement devices.,width=340,height=264 ]    if the input - output statistics violate the bell expression @xmath128 , then min - entropy associated with the output is non zero and thus certifiable randomness is obtained . in this case",
    "the randomness is certified by the bell s theorem .",
    "as the allowed correlations satisfy signal locality , bi violation implies that operational statistic must be unpredictable and thus randomness can be obtained without knowing the detail of the experimental device .",
    "the setup for di randomness certification is depicted in fig.[fig1 ] . to obtain a lower bound in the min - entropy corresponding to a given bell violation @xmath128 which does not depend on the input pair one has to first optimize the guessing probability over the all input pair @xmath129 .",
    "if this optimized value is denoted as @xmath130 then @xmath131 denote the minimum amount of random bits associated with bell violation @xmath128 .",
    "let alice is interested in the amount of minimum randomness obtained in ns theory ; which mean that any correlation satisfying ns condition is allowed to share between the measurement devices . in that case , the following optimization problem need to be solved : @xmath132 an input - output probability distribution would lie in @xmath133 if the following conditions are satisfied :    * @xmath134 @xmath135 * @xmath136 @xmath137 * @xmath138 @xmath139 * @xmath140 @xmath141    where the first and second conditions , respectively , denote positivity and normalization of a probability distribution , the last two conditions are known as ns condition . the minimum amount of random bits corresponding to bell violation @xmath128 in ns framework is therefore @xmath142 .    to obtain the minimum randomness in quantum theory one has to perform the following optimization problem : @xmath143\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where",
    "the optimization is performed over all states and all povms defined over hilbert space of arbitrary dimension .",
    "the second condition is to ensure that the obtained correlation is quantum one .",
    "adapting a straightforward way of technique introduced in @xcite , one can efficiently check whether a given correlation can be obtained via quantum means or not .",
    "the minimum random bits obtained in quantum theory corresponding to bi violation @xmath128 is thus quantified as @xmath144 . from the analysis of ref.@xcite it turns out that the minimum amount of randomness corresponding to a bell violation @xmath128 obtained from quantum mechanics is higher than that obtained under consideration of ns framework .",
    "nonlocal correlation finds applications in important information theoretic tasks and hence is considered as useful resource . quantifying the amount of nonlocality in a given correlation is , therefore , important from practical point of view .",
    "the amount of bi violation , beyond the _ local - realistic _ bound , gives a natural measure of nonlocality .",
    "this measure also has a operational interpretation as it gives the success probability of winning a nonlocal game ( eg .",
    "for the two - input two - output scenario the well known xor game ) .",
    "though the optimal success probability in qm is strictly greater than classical theory , it must be restricted in comparison to more general correlations compatible with relativistic causality . in the following we discuss this nontrivial aspect of quantum nonlocal correlations .",
    "popescu and rohrlich first gave an example of a correlation which is more nonlocal than quantum correlations but still satisfy the relativistic causality or no signaling ( ns ) principle .",
    "there correlation reads as : @xmath145    while in a generalized non - signaling theory bell expression ( left hand side of eq.([bi ] ) ) can reach the maximum algebraic value @xmath146 i(t is easy to verify that the correlation of eq.([pr ] ) achieves the maximal value @xmath146 ) in qm this value is restricted by @xmath147 .",
    "we have already seen that performing suitable dichotomic measurements on singlet state the value @xmath147 can be achieved .",
    "however , cirelson showed that sharing any bipartite state and performing any pairs of dichotomic observables on each part the maximum value of bell expression can not go beyond @xmath147 @xcite .",
    "this value is known as _",
    "cirelson bound_.",
    "so , on the one hand qm contains astonishing nonlocal correlation , on the other hand , surprisingly , the nonlocality in qm is restricted is some sense . in",
    "the recent past researchers have tried to find out physical principles that can explain this restricted nonlocal feature of qm .",
    "various interesting results have been derived in this regard .",
    "first successful attempt was made by w. van dam @xcite .",
    "the result is further generalized by brassard _",
    "et al . _ , who showed that in any world in which communication complexity is nontrivial , there is a bound on how much nature can be nonlocal @xcite .",
    "introduced a new information principle , namely information causality ( ic ) , which says that information that bob can gain about a data set with alice , by using all his local resources ( which may be correlated with alice s resources ) and a classical communication from her , is bounded by the information volume of the communication @xcite .",
    "the authors further showed that for any theory , satisfying ic , the bell quantity can not be larger than @xmath147 . on the other hand , navascues _",
    "_ postulated that any post - quantum theory should recover classical physics in the macroscopic limit @xcite . using this mechanism",
    "they were able to derive nontrivial bound on the strength of correlations between distant observers in any physical theory .",
    "recently , another principle , namely , local orthogonality @xcite or exclusivity @xcite , an intrinsically multi - partite principle , have been used for the same purpose .",
    "furthermore it has been shown that this principle also exactly singles out the cirelson bound @xcite .",
    "recently , there is a different kind of development where uncertainty principle and complementarity principle have been shown to be related to the nonlocality of a theory in a fundamental way . in the following we discuss these two aspects @xcite .      in a recent paper oppenheim and wehener",
    "have shown that qm can not be more nonlocal with measurements that respect the uncertainty principle @xcite .",
    "in fact they have proved that degree of nonlocality of any theory is determined by two factors : the strength of the uncertainty principle and the strength of a property called `` steering '' .",

    "there are more modern approach to express this impossibility in term of entropic measures @xcite .",

    "* steering * : steering denotes the power of remotely preparing different ensembles of a system s state at one place from another spatially separated place . in quantum theory",
    "this concept was first introduced by schrdinger @xcite .",
    "we know that a mixed state @xmath151 of a quantum system can be decomposed in many different ways as a convex sum : @xmath159 where @xmath160 s are density operators and @xmath161 denote probability distribution .",

    "alice can prepare these two ensemble by performing measurement on her particle along @xmath113-direction and @xmath45-direction , respectively .",
    "however , it has been later observed that steering is not a strict quantum phenomenon , rather there exist broad class of theories which exhibit this _ non classical _ feature @xcite .    with these two ideas , oppenheim _",
    "et al . _ succeeded to establish that for any physical theory , the strength of nonlocal correlations is determined by a trade off between two aspects : steerability and uncertainty . in the following we discuss this trade off for some interesting class of theories .    1 .",

    "q. theory _ : here , also , the ability to steer is only limited by the no - signaling principle , i.e. , maximal .",
    "but , due to presence of uncertainty the nonlocal power of this theory is restricted by cirelson bound .",
    "classical theory _ : in classical theory there is no restriction in knowing the values of different observables , simultaneously , or in other word we have no uncertainty relations on the full set of deterministic states .",
    "but , this theory shows no nonlocal property as steering is absent in this theory .",
    "local theory _ : on the other hand there exists local hypothetical theories , which have perfect steering , but only due to a high degree of uncertainty they do not exhibit nonlocal behavior . spekkens toy - bit model is one interesting example of such a theory @xcite . it has steering comparable to that in qm and box world",
    ". had there been no uncertainty , nonlocality would have been equal to that of box world .",
    "however , it can be shown that @xmath169 and hence the theory turns out to be local one .",
    "it is important to note that there is no difference among the theories described in ( c ) and ( d ) , so far their nonlocal behavior is concerned",
    ". however , the other properties of these theories are completely different .",
    "one of the original versions of the complementarity principle tells that there are observables in quantum mechanics that do not admit unambiguous joint measurement .",

    "<S> in 1935 , albert einstein and two colleagues , boris podolsky and nathan rosen ( epr ) developed a thought experiment to demonstrate what they felt was a lack of completeness in quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> epr also postulated the existence of more fundamental theory where physical reality of any system would be completely describe by the variables / states of that fundamental theory . </S>",
    "<S> this variable is commonly called hidden variable and the theory is called hidden variable theory ( hvt ) . in 1964 , john bell proposed an empirically verifiable criterion to test for the existence of these hvts . </S>",
    "<S> he derived an inequality , which must be satisfied by any theory that fulfill the conditions of _ locality _ and _ reality_. he also showed that quantum mechanics , as it violates this inequality , is incompatible with any _ local - realistic _ theory . </S>",
    "<S> later it has been shown that bell s inequality can be derived from different set of assumptions and it also find applications in useful information theoretic protocols . in this review </S>",
    "<S> we will discuss various foundational as well as information theoretic implications of bell s inequality . </S>",
    "<S> we will also discuss about some restricted nonlocal feature of quantum nonlocality and elaborate the role of uncertainty principle and complementarity principle in explaining this feature . </S>"
