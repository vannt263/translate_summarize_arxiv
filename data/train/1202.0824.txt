    "observations suggest that star formation in galaxies is regulated by feedback processes . in rapidly star - forming galaxies",
    ", feedback operates on large scales , driving galaxy - wide superwinds , which can eject the raw materials for future stellar generations if the interstellar material is launched with enough momentum to escape the host galaxy s gravitational potential .",
    "otherwise , the ejected material may be re - accreted in a so - called `` fountain flow '' .",
    "these issues are crucial for understanding the formation of stars in rapidly star - forming galaxies across cosmic time .",
    "the exceptionally high star formation rates present in starburst galaxies make them optimal targets to probe feedback processes .",
    "the focus of this paper is the archetype of this class of objects , m82 .",
    "this galaxy s proximity ( 3.63 mpc ; @xmath13pc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and nearly edge - on geometry ( @xmath14 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) make it a superb laboratory for studying the physics of galactic winds and star formation . at infrared wavelengths ,",
    "its luminosity is @xmath15 @xcite , which makes it one of the brightest and most observed infrared objects in the sky .",
    "most of its infrared luminosity originates in the starburst core , which is severely obscured by dust at visible and ultraviolet wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the origin of m82 s starburst is thought to be a tidal interaction with its more massive companion , m81 , @xmath910@xmath16 years ago @xcite .",
    "the pronounced h  @xmath6i bridge that connects the galaxies @xcite is strong evidence for such an interaction , and @xcite found that the `` cloud of h  @xmath6i '' that engulfs the m81 group is dominated by filamentary tidal structures , which suggests a violent past of tidal interaction .",
    "in addition to the dynamical effects associated with tidal forces from m81 , the global dynamics and evolution of the starburst are further perturbed by the presence of a stellar bar @xcite , which may have formed as a result of the interaction .    as an interacting , barred galaxy , m82 s observed dynamical properties are distinct from those seen in typical sb and sc galaxies .",
    "molecular gas measurements by @xcite show that the co velocity field contains warps and peculiarities that are consistent with a significant non - circular velocity component , perhaps due to radial infall or a polar ring tilted with respect to the major axis .",
    "in addition , measurements of co ( 2,1 ) by @xcite suggest that the rotation of the gas disk is nearly keplerian at radii @xmath17 1  kpc .",
    "@xcite reproduced this keplerian motion with a model in which the outer disk and halo were stripped during the encounter with m81 .",
    "although flat rotation curves are observed in the vast majority of galaxies , @xcite found falling rotation curves in several tidally interacting galaxies , which suggests that some dark matter is stripped from galaxies during interactions .",
    "the h  @xmath6i velocity field along the major axis is similar to the co velocity field ; it also has peculiarities such as a sudden drop at @xmath91  kpc , which some authors have interpreted as a falling rotation curve @xcite .",
    "it is important to note , however , that the h  @xmath6i gas is highly disrupted and may not provide a reliable rotation curve for the outer disk .",
    "in fact , @xcite state that rotation dominates the h  @xmath6i kinematic signature inside the central 1  kpc , but the outer region is characterized by a significant , likely tidally induced , nonrotational component .",
    "the gas and stars in m82 have been shown to be composed of two distinct kinematic structures .",
    "@xcite found that the axis of gas rotation is offset from the stellar rotation axis and the photometric major axis by @xmath912@xmath18 .",
    "this result implies that , in long - slit spectroscopic studies , the shape of the rotation curve is particularly sensitive to the position and alignment of the slit .",
    "in addition , @xcite studied m82 s star cluster population out to @xmath92.6  kpc radius and found that the rotation curve as traced by the clusters is flat at large radii , which further distinguishes the stellar kinematic tracers from the previous measurements of the gas kinematics .",
    "@xcite proposed that m82 s starburst activity occurred in two successive episodes that each lasted a few million years and peaked about 10@xmath19 and 5@xmath2010@xmath21 years ago . in this model ,",
    "the encounter with m81 triggered the first burst in the central 500  pc by inducing strong large - scale torques , loss of angular momentum , and an infall of molecular clouds toward the nuclear region .",
    "the second burst occurred in a circumnuclear ring and along the stellar bar and is attributed to bar - induced dynamical resonances .",
    "the @xcite starburst model can explain the apparent abundance of red supergiants ( rsgs ) that dominate the light within 500  pc radius .    in order to understand the dynamics of the ejected gas and constrain the physics of feedback processes in m82 ,",
    "it is essential to accurately measure the total dynamical mass on both the small scales of star - forming regions and the large scales of the entire galaxy .",
    "rotation curves are most commonly employed to determine the distribution of mass in galaxies @xcite , and many studies have employed gas and stellar kinematics at a range of wavelengths to measure radial velocities in m82 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite includes a compilation of these results .",
    "given that m82 has recently undergone tidal interactions and harbors an extraordinary superwind , stellar kinematics should be a more reliable tracer of the mass distribution than the gas .",
    "nearly all previous stellar kinematic measurements used visible - wavelength tracers , which may be compromised by the substantial dust attenuation present in the galaxy .",
    "the near - infrared @xmath0band is a better tracer of the stellar kinematics , as attenuation @xmath22 in the @xmath0band is approximately a factor of 10 less than in the @xmath23band . in this study",
    ", we use @xmath0band spectroscopy to study m82 s gas and stellar kinematics , mass distribution , and stellar populations .",
    "we obtained @xmath0band spectra of m82 at the mount graham international observatory with the luci-1 spectrograph and the large binocular telescope ( lbt ) on 2011 february 10 .",
    "the observations were made through a @xmath0band filter ( 2.05 - 2.37@xmath3 m ) with the n1.8 camera , which has a plate scale of @xmath24 pixel@xmath25 and a field of view of @xmath26 .",
    "a grating with 210 lines mm@xmath25 was used with a slit width of @xmath27 .",
    "this combination yields a spectral resolution of @xmath283000 or 100 km  s@xmath25 . with sufficient signal - to - noise",
    ", the centroid of the cross correlation function for relative velocity measurements can be measured with much higher resolution .",
    "two slit positions , which we designate as m82e and m82w , were used to measure the rotation curve out to @xmath294kpc ) from the center of the galaxy .",
    "we centered each end of the slit on the nuclear region at a position angle of @xmath1 ( figure  [ fig : slits ] ) .",
    "the observations were made with 300 second exposures in an _ object - sky _ sequence for a total on - source integration time of 1 hour per slit position . a telluric standard close in air mass to m82",
    "was observed before and after both the m82e and m82w observations .",
    "we carried out standard data reduction with the irafsoftware package .",
    "the two - dimensional data were transformed onto an orthogonal wavelength / slit - position grid based on a wavelength solution from the sky s bright oh emission lines .",
    "this transformation linearized the dispersion to @xmath91.64    pixel@xmath25 .",
    "we used the xtellcor @xcite package in idl to correct for absorption from earth s atmosphere .",
    "the telluric standard spectra had slightly higher spectral resolution than was obtained for m82 .",
    "this is likely because the light from the stars did not fill the 1@xmath30 wide slit .",
    "this complication was remedied by convolving the telluric spectra with gaussians to match their resolutions to m82 .",
    "long and they overlap on the center of the galaxy .",

    "to measure the rotation curve , we symmetrically extracted 30 apertures each from the m82e and m82w slit positions .",
    "we progressively increased the aperture widths at larger radii to achieve a sufficient signal - to - noise ratio in the stellar continuum .",
    "figure  [ fig : spec ] shows illustrative @xmath0band spectra from m82 s nucleus and eastern side .",
    "we measured the rotation curve out to nearly 4  kpc radius with the @xmath2co  stellar absorption band head at 2.29  @xmath3m(co@xmath4 ) and to @xmath91  kpc radius with gas emission ( he  i , h@xmath8 , and br@xmath7 ) from the interstellar medium .",
    "we have assumed an inclination of 80@xmath18 and corrected each velocity accordingly .",
    "it is important to note that the choice of dynamical center may introduce systematic uncertainties , as the photometric center does not necessarily coincide with the dynamical center .",

    "although it is difficult to observationally determine the origin of m82 s bar , the effects of its presence can be seen in our stellar rotation curve as the symmetric , sharp features on either side of the nucleus .",

    "this cluster , which was identified as cluster ` z ' by @xcite , likely dominates the flux from this aperture , and its velocity excess with respect to the main rotation curve likely indicates strong non - circular motion .",
    "however , it is puzzling that multiple points define the feature and that no other studies have seen this second peak in the rotation curve .",
    "other possible explanations for the feature are the presence of tightly wound spiral arms and patchy @xmath0band extinction .",
    "our data contain evidence of a `` velocity reversal '' ( velocity decrease ) at @xmath91.0  kpc on both the eastern and western sides of the galaxy .",
    "@xcite highlights the existence of a 100  km  s@xmath25 velocity reversal of gas and/or stars at @xmath91.0  kpc in h@xmath37 and h@xmath38 stellar absorption on the eastern side of the galaxy , as well as in ionized gas emission lines at visible and blue wavelengths on the eastern and western sides ; interestingly , the feature is apparently absent in near - infrared ca  ii stellar absorption .",
    "although the velocity amplitude of our detection is approximately a factor of 10 less , the reversal is present in our data .",
    "local extinction is not likely to be the culprit , as the feature is symmetric with respect to the nucleus .",
    "@xcite investigates the hypothesis that the reversal is due to local surface density enhancements associated with spiral arms @xcite , but finds inconsistencies with this picture .",
    "for instance , the absence of the velocity reversal in near - infrared ca  ii stellar absorption suggests that it is not inherent to the disk , and the blue - wavelength detections of the eastern velocity reversal reach negative velocities , which can not be explained from the rotation of a stellar disk with embedded corotating spiral arms .",

    "we measured the rotation curve with the br@xmath7 , he@xmath6  i , and h@xmath8 emission lines from the interstellar medium out to 1  kpc from the nucleus .",
    "these gas rotation curves have velocities 10  @xmath5  50  km  s@xmath25 greater than the stellar velocities ( figure  [ fig : compare ] ) .",
    "the gas dynamics are expected to be disrupted more than the stars by the presence of tides and galactic winds , which is the likely origin of the stellar and gas velocity differences .",
    "we used the stellar absorption data to measure the mass distribution ( figure  [ fig : mass ] ) and investigate the stellar populations as a function of radius ( figure  [ fig : eqw ] ) .",
    "we estimate the total dynamical mass of m82 is @xmath43  @xmath44 .",
    "the strong variation in w@xmath4  with radius clearly indicates that the starburst is located within the central 500  pc radius .",
    "the superwind is likely launched from this region , and we estimate its mass is @xmath45  @xmath44 .",
    "this mass estimate is somewhat uncertain due to the presence of non - circular motions , but nevertheless provides an upper limit to the gravitational potential of the starburst region .",
    "we thank mark westmoquette for comments and supplying data for figures [ fig : co ] and [ fig : compare ] .",
    "we also appreciate the helpful comments from the referee .",
