    "the study of the fragmentation functions of heavy flavoured hadrons is of considerable interest in several aspects of qcd and collider physics . on one hand , at transverse momenta much larger than the mass of the heavy flavour , the heavy - flavour fragmentation functions behave similarly to the light - hadron ones , and obey an altarelli - parisi evolution equation . unlike the case of light hadrons , however , heavy - flavour fragmentation is very hard , and thus probes a region of the evolution equation in the large @xmath4 regime .",
    "furthermore , it is dominated by the non - singlet component , at least at moderate energies , so that its study is much simpler .",
    "the initial condition for evolution has a well defined perturbative expansion in powers of @xmath5 , @xmath6 being the mass of the heavy flavour , and a well defined expansion in terms of sudakov ( i.e.  large-@xmath4 ) logarithms .",
    "further corrections of non - perturbative origin , suppressed by powers of the ratio @xmath7 , can be parametrized to attempt to give a uniform description of charm and bottom fragmentation functions .",
    "these parameterizations can then be employed to provide theoretical predictions for charmed and bottomed hadron production in hadron - hadron , photon - hadron and photon - photon collisions at large transverse momenta .",
    "recently , new , high quality data on charmed meson production have come from cleo  @xcite and belle  @xcite .",
    "one thus has the opportunity to perform a more accurate fit to the non - perturbative initial conditions , and furthermore one can test the evolution of the fragmentation function from centre - of - mass energies of 10.6 to 91.2  gev , using charm data from lep experiments . in the present work we will carry out this program .",
    "we develop a procedure that overcomes various difficulties in the large-@xmath4 region of the fragmentation function .",
    "we are thus able to fit the measured fragmentation functions using next - to - leading logarithmic ( nll ) evolution , next - to - leading order ( nlo ) initial conditions , nlo coefficient functions , nll sudakov resummation ( both for the initial conditions and for the coefficient functions ) and a phenomenological non - perturbative component . with a suitable choice of this non - perturbative component",
    "we can obtain very good fits to cleo and belle data for @xmath1 and @xmath8 fragmentation , over the whole @xmath4 range .",
    "all the moments of the fragmentation functions are therefore well reproduced .",
    "this represents an improvement over previous investigations where , while obtaining good fits to some low moments ( a necessary and sufficient condition for predicting heavy - meson production in hadronic collisions ) the fit in @xmath4-space was not completely satisfactory . the same procedure is also applied to @xmath3 meson spectra measured in @xmath9 decays . the relevant data from the aleph  @xcite opal  @xcite , sld  @xcite and delphi  @xcite collaborations are equally well described .",
    "we evolve the @xmath1 fragmentation function fitted to cleo and belle data up to lep energies , taking into account the opening of the bottom threshold  @xcite .",
    "we find a discrepancy between the qcd prediction and the aleph data  @xcite , that can be parametrized as a power correction of the form @xmath10 , with @xmath11 of the order of few hundreds mev , or of the form @xmath12 , with @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the total centre - of - mass energy and @xmath15 is the moment in mellin space .",
    "unfortunately , there is no way , at the moment , to discriminate between the two possibilities .",
    "theoretical arguments based upon renormalons disfavour the presence of @xmath16 corrections in the evolution of fragmentation functions . on the other hand ,",
    "these arguments require validation .    in section  [ sec : thframe ]",
    "we describe the theoretical ingredients that enter our calculation , collecting and summarizing previously available results : the perturbative initial condition , the evolution , the sudakov effects and the bottom threshold .",
    "the novel treatment of the large-@xmath15/large-@xmath4 region is also detailed here . in section  [ sec : isr ] we describe our treatment of electromagnetic initial - state radiation .",
    "the implementation of the non - perturbative component of the fragmentation function is discussed in section  [ sec : nonpff ] . in section  [ sec : cleobelle ]",
    "we perform fits to the cleo and belle data . in section  [ sec : aleph ]",
    "we compare the evolved cleo / belle @xmath1 fit to the aleph data , and discuss in detail the related problems . fits for @xmath3 meson production",
    "are presented in section  [ sec : bfit ] . in section  [",
    "sec : moment ] , we perform fits to data under a different perspective , using mellin moments rather than the @xmath4-space distributions , and employing a simpler , one - parameter non - perturbative function , that can be related to @xmath17 power corrections .",
    "the implications of the new belle and cleo data for heavy - flavour hadroproduction are also discussed in this section .",

    "we define @xmath4 as the scaled energy of the final heavy quark , x . in our framework",

    "<S> we compare qcd theoretical predictions for heavy flavoured mesons fragmentation spectra in @xmath0 annihilation with data from cleo , belle and lep . </S>",
    "<S> we include several effects in our calculation : next - to - leading order initial conditions , evolution and coefficient functions . </S>",
    "<S> soft - gluon effects are resummed at next - to - leading - log accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> a matching condition for the crossing of the bottom threshold in evolution is also implemented at next - to - leading order accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> important initial - state electromagnetic radiation effects in the cleo and belle data are accounted for . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , with reasonably simple choices of a non - perturbative correction to the fixed - order initial condition for the evolution , the data from cleo and belle can be fitted with remarkable accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> the fitted fragmentation function , when evolved to lep energies , does not however represent fairly the @xmath1 fragmentation spectrum measured by aleph . </S>",
    "<S> large non - perturbative corrections to the coefficient functions of the meson spectrum are needed in order to reconcile cleo / belle and aleph results.non-perturbative parameters extracted from the fits to @xmath0 fragmentation data for @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons are tabulated . </S>",
    "<S> they can be employed in the theoretical predictions for the production of charmed and bottomed mesons in hadron - hadron , photon - hadron and photon - photon collisions .    </S>",
