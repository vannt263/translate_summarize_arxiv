    "in 1995 , min - oo @xcite , inspired by the work of schoen and yau @xcite on the positive mass theorem , conjectured that if @xmath9 is a compact riemannian manifold with boundary such that the scalar curvature of @xmath10 is at least @xmath11 and whose boundary @xmath12 is totally geodesic and isometric to the standard sphere , then @xmath10 is isometric to the closed hemisphere @xmath13 equipped with the standard round metric .",
    "this conjecture were verified in many particular cases , but it is false in general .",
    "in fact , brendle , marques and neves in @xcite constructed some families of metrics on @xmath14 , @xmath15 , that are counter - examples to this conjecture .",
    "one important case where min - oo s conjecture is true , proved by hang and wang in @xcite , is when we consider metrics in the conformal class to the standard metric on the hemisphere :    [ hang - wang @xcite][hw ] let @xmath16 be a @xmath17 metric on the unit closed hemisphere @xmath13 , where @xmath18 denotes the standard round metric .",
    "assume that    * @xmath19 , and * the boundary is totally geodesic and isometric to the standard @xmath20 .",
    "then @xmath21 is isometric to @xmath18 .",
    "recently , spiegel @xcite showed a scalar curvature rigidity theorem for locally conformally flat manifolds with boundary in the spirit of min - oo s conjecture which is an extension of hang - wang s theorem . to be more precise ,",
    "let @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 be the geodesic ball of radius @xmath25 centered at @xmath26 in @xmath27 .",
    "let @xmath28 be the mean curvature of the boundary @xmath29 , measured with respect to the inward orientation .",

    ", the mean curvature is measured with respect to the inward orientation .",
    "then @xmath2 is isometric to @xmath35 with the standard metric .",
    "spiegel also proved that the assumption on the mean curvature in the theorem above can be dropped provided @xmath10 is simply - connected and @xmath36 .",
    "see remark 1.3 in @xcite .",
    "therefore , theorem [ sp ] is an extension of theorem [ hw ] .",

    "we are interested in the min - oo s conjecture for compact connected locally conformally flat riemannian manifolds @xmath9 satisfying a more general curvature condition .",
    "it is well known that the scalar curvature is , up to a constant , the sum of the eigenvalues of the schouten tensor @xmath38 .",
    "in fact , let @xmath39 denote its eigenvalues , then @xmath40    it is natural to ask if the min - oo s conjecture holds when one considers a more general function on the eigenvalues of the schouten tensor instead of the scalar curvature . of special interest",

    ", we need to define the type of curvature function for the eigenvalues of the schouten tensor that we will consider .",
    "first , let us recall the notion of elliptic data originally introduced by caffarelli , nirenberg and spruck @xcite ; we use the theory developed by li and li for conformal equations ( cf .",

    "@xmath56 .",
    "let @xmath57 be a riemannian manifold .",

    "it is well - known that the schouten tensor of the standard @xmath0-sphere is @xmath62 , then , condition ( 7 ) above says that we are normalizing the functional @xmath50 to be @xmath63 when considering the schouten tensor of the standard sphere , i.e. , @xmath64 where we have used that @xmath50 is homogeneous of degree one .    in this paper , we prove that the min - oo s conjecture holds for super - solutions to elliptic data in locally conformally flat manifolds .",
