    "charge transport across a mesoscopic constriction is affected by the electromagnetic properties of the biasing circuitry .",
    "for example , charge tunneling between two conductors can be enhanced or inhibited , depending on which electromagnetic modes the tunneling charge is able to excite  @xcite .",
    "if the tunnel junction is superconducting , the energy emitted to the electromagnetic environment can be controlled by an external bias , due to the absence of electronic states below the superconducting energy gap . the possibility to engineer the electromagnetic environment and to guide the emitted microwaves as wanted , lends this system to a versatile source for propagating microwave radiation  @xcite .",
    "also motivated by fundamental understanding of quantum transport , the quantum optical aspects of mesoscopic charge conduction are presently under active theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite research .    photon - assisted charge - transport across low - transparency tunnel junctions has been well understood within the framework of the @xmath0-theory  @xcite .",
    "it describes effects such as multi - photon - assisted charge tunneling and the coulomb blockade .",
    "recently , it has been understood that the theory also characterizes the simultaneously emitted electromagnetic radiation  @xcite , analogously predicting generation of non - classical photon pairs  @xcite and anti - bunched photons  @xcite .",
    "these non - classical states of light are important tools for quantum - information applications .",
    "the versatile theory captures the reaction of an arbitrary continuous - mode environment to a single charge - tunneling event exactly .",
    "however , this perturbative approach is equivalent to the fermi s golden rule and can not model dynamics beyond the independent tunneling limit . in specific situations",
    "we can straightforwardly study effects beyond this by using jaynes - cummings type approaches , such as in the case of a single - mode electromagnetic environment . here",
    ", it has been predicted that far from equilibrium a simple dc - bias can drive the cavity into rather exotic states , for example , exhibiting squeezing  @xcite , sub - poissonian photon distributions  @xcite and multi - stable trapping  @xcite .",
    "an important characteristic of creating electromagnetic radiation solely by inelastic charge transport is the usual rather fast dephasing of the emitted field .",
    "this is due to the effective series resistive environment , which is needed to create high - frequency radiation but , in the presence of finite zero - frequency resistivity , will also inevitably induce low - frequency voltage - fluctuations , due to a finite temperature or shot noise in the charge transport  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore essential to carefully consider the effect of both low- and high - frequency properties of the biasing circuitry to the studied phenomena .",
    "this is automatically addressed by @xmath0-type approaches studied here .    in this article",
    ", we establish a continuous - mode description of the electromagnetic radiation emitted by inelastic cooper - pair tunneling which accounts for correlations between consecutively tunneling cooper pairs .",

    "can , in princible , describe any electromagnetic environment of the josephson junction , and is therefore an excellent system for understanding photon - assisted cooper - pair tunneling .",
    "we find that the formalism allows for investigation of the emitted radiation in terms of the tunneling current across the junction .",
    "this is used to show that the finite - frequency current noise at the junction is up to a linear filter function and a term describing thermal noise determined by the outgoing photon flux .",
    "the flux - flux correlations of the emitted field are , however , also functions of other moments of the junction current .",
    "the leading - order expansion in the tunneling coupling , similar to the @xmath0-theory , has been previously used to study emission statistics in the independent - tunneling picture  @xcite .",
    "we here demonstrate a systematic expansion of system properties up to the fourth order in the tunneling coupling and capture temporal correlations between consecutively tunneling cooper pairs .",
    "a central result is the natural appearance of the keldysh time - ordering in the photonic correlators , connecting the normal time - ordering used in quantum optics and the keldysh ordering in quantum transport . within this approach ,",
    "we are able to study effects in temporal correlations for all forms of the electromagnetic environment in the limit of weak cooper - pair tunneling .",
    "particularly , we study how the correlations in the charge transport affect the first- and second - order coherences of emitted photons .",
    "the general motivation is to understand how microwave measurements can be used to probe charge - transport statistics , and vice versa , how correlations in the charge transport can be used to produce non - conventional states of light .    the article is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : model ] , we introduce our theory for charge transport and the microwave emission in this system . in section  [ sec : solution ] , we derive a description for the emitted field in terms of the junction current and study general relations between the finite - frequency noise at the junction and the emitted photon flux density . in section  [ sec : power ] , they are explicitly calculated up to fourth order in the tunneling coupling across the josephson junction .",
    "the calculation is first presented on the keldysh contour and numerical results for specific transmission lines are analyzed . in section  [ sec : photons ] , we do a similar analysis for the second - order coherence of the emitted photons . conclusions and outlook are given in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
