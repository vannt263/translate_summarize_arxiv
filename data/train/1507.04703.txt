    "the _ planck _ team has reported evidence of anomalous features in the large - scale cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) which point towards violations of statistical isotropy @xcite .",
    "some of these anomalies were already observed by wmap , and have been now re - confirmed @xcite , hence reducing the possibility of instrumental origin or systematics .",
    "although the associated statistical significances are still inconclusive , the intriguing possibility that these features are traces of fundamental physics beyond the simplest inflationary models have attracted considerable attention in the theoretical community .    among the different anomalies detected , the _ power asymmetry_unequal power in different regions of the sky ",
    "has received significant attention , and it is also the main target of this paper .",
    "this asymmetry was first modeled by adding a modulating factor to an otherwise statistically isotropic temperature distribution @xcite [ mod ] t()=(1+a ( ) ) t_iso(n ) where @xmath0 is the modulating function . _",
    "planck _ has reported no evidence for @xmath1 different from zero for @xmath2 , but a statistically significant ( about @xmath3 ) @xmath4 , _ dipolar _ modulation has been found @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the effect of this dipole on the angular power spectrum @xmath5 has been detected _ only _ for low multipoles with @xmath6 .",
    "more precisely , after separating the @xmath7-range into bins of size @xmath8 , only the first bin shows a non - vanishing signal , with average amplitude @xmath9 .",
    "observations are compatible with @xmath10 for larger values of @xmath7 .",
    "this scale dependence implies that the simple parametrization ( [ mod ] ) is insufficient to account for the observed modulation .",
    "the theoretical challenge is therefore to find a mechanism able to produce a dipolar modulation present only on large scales , with negligible contribution to the quadrupole , octupole , etc , and furthermore respecting the existing constraints on the cmb : a remarkably gaussian , almost - scale invariant spectrum of adiabatic perturbations .",
    "not surprisingly , it has been difficult to find a completely satisfactory model @xcite .",
    "one of the first and most compelling ideas to generate such a power asymmetry was introduced by erickcek , carroll , and kamionkowski in @xcite .",
    "it relies on the fact that the presence of a very long wavelength , super - hubble perturbation of a curvaton field will induce a dipole modulation in the observed spectrum , provided its wavelength is still short enough that its amplitude shows a gradient across the sky .",
    "this long mode could originate , for instance , as a remnant of the pre - inflationary epoch .",
    "this idea has been implemented by several authors and improved in different directions ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "another interesting proposal , introduced in @xcite , works instead in a single - field inflationary model , and generates the power modulation through a non - gaussian _ coupling _ between observable scales in the cmb and even larger , super - hubble scales .",
    "the reason why non - gaussianity can induce anisotropies in the observed spectrum , even if the underlying statistics is isotropic , is simply because a typical realization looks significantly more anisotropic if the underlying distribution is non - gaussian . or in other words , because observable modes couple to the _ particular realization _ of the long wavelength modes in our universe , which is generically anisotropic .",
    "this model , therefore , requires a mechanism to generate large correlations between very different scales .",
    "the consistency relation proposed in @xcite tell us that it is difficult to find a realistic single field model producing that type of non - gaussianity .    in this work",
    "we introduce a scenario which has features in common with both of the previous ideas .",
    "we consider a single field inflationary model preceded by a bounce described by loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) .",
    "this scenario has been analyzed in great detail , both for the background space - time and for perturbations ( see @xcite for reviews ) . in short",
    ", the evolution of perturbations across the bounce excites quanta out of an initial vacuum , and as a consequence the onset of inflation is reached in an excited state , rather than in the bunch - davies vacuum .",
    "the presence of those perturbations , remnants of the pre - inflationary phase , have an important impact on the non - gaussianity generated during inflation .",
    "we compute those non - gaussianity and the modulation they produce on observable scales , and show that the observed power asymmetry can have an origin on the quantum bounce preceding inflation , while still respecting all observational constraints .",
    "we set @xmath11=1 but keep @xmath12 and @xmath13 explicitly .",
    "numerical values are given in planck units .",
    "in lqc , the mean effective space - time geometry is described by equations which incorporate the leading quantum corrections to general relativity . for instance",
    ", the friedmann equation reads @xcite [ feq ] h^2= ( 1- ) , where @xmath14 is the hubble rate , @xmath15 the energy density , and @xmath16 its _ upper bound _ , which is a fraction of the planck energy density @xmath17 .",
    "in this paper the matter sector is assumed to be a single scalar field with mass @xmath18 .",
    "more complicated potentials can be incorporated .",
    "however , the effects we are seeking have a quantum gravity origin , and the form inflaton potential produces sub - leading contributions . at low energies @xmath19 , eq .",
    "( [ feq ] ) becomes indistinguishable from the general relativistic friedmann equation .",
    "however , close to the planck scale quantum gravitational effects break the linear relation between @xmath20 and @xmath15 , and bring @xmath14 to zero while @xmath15 attaints its maximum value .",
    "this is a quantum bounce that ` bridges ' a contracting and an expanding phase of the universe .",
    "the theory of cosmological perturbations in lqc that we use in this paper was developed in @xcite , and has been used in @xcite to study the evolution of perturbations across the bounce through the end of inflation , and to compute the primordial power spectrum of tensor and scalar perturbations .",
    "this scenario is based on first principles , and trans - planckian issues can be addressed squarely .",
    "the free parameters relevant for phenomenological studies are the value of the inflaton field at some arbitrary reference time , e.g.   the bounce , @xmath21 , its mass @xmath18 , and the initial state of perturbations at some initial time",
    ". refs . @xcite",
    "have explored the predictions for the power spectrum across the parameter space and contrasted the results with observations .    from the viewpoint of inflation",
    ", the effect of the preceding bounce translates to an excited state @xmath22 for perturbations at the onset of slow - roll .",
    "therefore , the lqc pre - inflationary evolution can be conveniently encoded in the bogoliubov coefficients @xmath23 and @xmath24 relating @xmath22 and the bunch - davies vacuum , i.e.   relating the mode functions of curvature perturbations @xmath25 that result from the pre - inflationary evolution , and the bunch - davies modes @xmath26 . these coefficients can computed numerically for a choice of the free parameters . for @xmath27 and @xmath28 ,",
    "both in planck units , and `` minkowski - like '' vacuum initial condition for perturbations at one planck second before the bounce , we obtain that the average number of quanta present at the onset of inflation , given by @xmath29 , is approximately @xmath30 for the reference mode @xmath31 which today corresponds to @xmath32 . for the longest wavelength mode we can directly measure , @xmath33 , we obtain @xmath34 , and @xmath35 for lower values of @xmath36 @xcite",
    ". other choices of initial data give similar results ( see @xcite for details ) .    the inflationary scalar power spectrum in the presence of an excited state @xmath22",
    "is given by @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the bunch - davies result .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the numerically computed @xmath39 for the choice of parameters mentioned above .",
    "two energy scales play an important role in the power spectrum .",
    "first , lqc introduces a _ new energy scale _ @xmath40 , that is directly related to the space - time scalar curvature at the bounce @xmath41 .",
    "a second scale is provided by the value of curvature at the onset of accelerated expansion @xmath42 , which occurs at time @xmath43notice that @xmath43 is not the onset of _ slow - roll _ , which happens at later times .",
    "modes @xmath44 are ` inside ' the curvature radius  i.e .",
    "its wavelength is shorter than the curvature radius  during the bounce , and exit during the slow - roll era .",
    "these perturbations reach the onset of slow - roll in the bunch - davies vacuum , and their power spectrum is indistinguishable from standard results .",
    "modes @xmath45 exit the curvature radius soon before the bounce and re - enter after it , to exit again during slow - roll .",
    "the crossing process around the bounce time amplifies the amplitude of those modes , which then reach inflation in an excited states .",
    "finally , modes @xmath46 are outside the hubble radius during the entire evolution , even at the onset of inflation , and their spectrum is significantly suppressed .",
    "the reference mode @xmath31 , that today corresponds to @xmath32 , is approximately one third of @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "consequently , the lqc corrections to the observable power spectrum only appear for the largest angular scales in the sky , that correspond to multiples @xmath49 , and are only significant for the lowest multiples .",
    "furthermore , the lqc corrections significantly increases the power for modes with wavelengths larger than the hubble radius today .",
    "this power enhancement conveniently reaches a maximum around @xmath50 , at which perturbation theory is still well under control .     and @xmath28 , and `` minkowski - like '' vacuum initial conditions at one planck second before the bounce @xcite .",
    "gray points show the numerical result for individual modes .",
    "the spectrum is rapidly oscillatory , and its average is shown in black .",
    "the spectrum is amplified for low wave - numbers @xmath45 , but the enhancement is only significant for the very low multipoles in the cmb , for which the observational error bars are large because cosmic variance .",
    "therefore , this power spectrum is compatible with current observations .",
    "[ fig1],scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "an important question is whether the energy in the quanta present at the onset of slow - roll produces significant back - reaction on the inflationary space - time geometry which can not be neglected .",
    "the energy density on the perturbations can be computed and compared to the vacuum result .",
    "the _ difference _ in energy density between the state @xmath22 and the bunch - davies vacuum can be written as [ deltarho ] ( t)= \\ { |_k|^2 ( |_k^bd|^2 + |_k^bd|^2 ) + + re } , where the integral in @xmath36 is extended from @xmath51 to @xmath52 .",
    "it is well known that the difference of expectation values of the energy - momentum tensor between states that are at least of fourth adiabatic order is always finite , hence no renormalization is required in ( [ deltarho ] ) .",
    "numerical evaluation shows that the ratio of @xmath53 with the background energy density @xmath54 , is @xmath55 at the onset of slow - roll , and decreases exponentially with cosmic time .",
    "therefore , since the energy density in the bunch - davies vacuum is known to be negligible small , the back - reaction of the state @xmath22 on the inflationary geometry can be neglected .",
    "at leading order in perturbation theory , non - gaussianity is characterized by the bispectrum @xmath56 , defined in terms of the three - point function :    _ _",
    "1__2__3=(2)^3 ^ 3(_1+_2+_3)b_(_1,_2,_3 ) .",
    "the non - gaussianity generated from excited states in inflation has been analyzed by several authors ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it was pointed out in @xcite that the main characteristic of the associated bispectrum is an enhancement in ` squeezed ' configurations which involve very different scales , @xmath57 .",
    "these non - gaussian correlations originate from quantum interactions between particles that are present at the onset of slow - roll . in realistic models , including the scenario presented in this paper , the conclusions of the consistency relation proposed in @xcite are still satisfied in the limit @xmath58 , but nevertheless there are important effects for small , but finite , values of @xmath59 .",
    "the full expression for the bispectrum @xmath56 as a function of the state @xmath22 was obtained in @xcite , and is given in the appendix .",
    "we have used those results to numerically computed @xmath56 at the end of inflation .",
    "the main difference with previous analysis is that the state @xmath22 is now _ computed _ from a quantum gravity framework , rather than postulated .",
    "the resulting bispectrum , therefore , carries information about the pre - inflationary evolution .",
    "those effects are more clearly displayed by plotting the ratio with the standard bunch - davies bispectrum @xmath60 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "as expected , the bispectrum is strongly peaked in squeezed triangles , where the ratio @xmath61 shows a growth proportional to @xmath62 i.e .",
    "proportional to product of the number of quanta in the modes @xmath63 and @xmath64 , as expected for an enhancement originated from particle interactions . as for the power spectrum",
    ", the enhancement _ only _ appears for modes @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , there are strong correlations between the largest wavelengths we can directly observe ( @xmath66 ) and super - hubble modes with @xmath36 values in the range @xmath65 .",
    "the bispectrum becomes negligibly small when the three momenta are in observable scales , hence respecting current constraints on non - gaussianity .",
    "this scale dependence of the bispectrum will play an important role in the next section .",
    "recall that the three modes involved in bispectrum must form a triangle , so it is really a function of two momenta , e.g.  @xmath67 .",
    "the shape of the bispectrum , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , can be understood by writing its dominant contribution in the squeezed limit @xmath68 : [ bisp ] b_4 _",

    "the parameter @xmath74 is the value of the conformal time at the onset of slow - roll .",
    "for the example @xmath27 and @xmath75 we obtain @xmath76 , so all observable modes are deeply inside the hubble radius at the onset of slow - roll .",
    "the largest contribution to ( [ bisp ] ) comes from very squeezed configurations for which @xmath77 . in that limit @xmath78",
    "is dominated by the terms proportional to @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "this contrasts with the example considered in @xcite of a scale invariant excited state @xmath22 , and where additionally the analysis was restricted to observable scales for which @xmath81 for all @xmath82 . in that case the leading contributions come from the terms proportional to @xmath83 and @xmath84 .     and @xmath64 for a fixed @xmath85 .",
    "the plot shows the range of @xmath86 and @xmath64 allowed by the triangle condition @xmath87 .",
    "the bispectrum @xmath78 is highly scale dependent and shows a prominent enhancement for squeezed configurations @xmath88 .",
    "[ fig2],scaledwidth=48.0% ]        it is important to note that the non - gaussianity computed here are generated during slow - roll inflation .",
    "extra contributions to the bispectrum will certainly arise from the evolution across the bounce .",
    "however , since the state of perturbations is very close to vacuum at the bounce time , those contributions are expected to be subdominant .",
    "this expectation is indeed borne out in explicit computations in bouncing models @xcite , where it is shown that the non - gaussianity generated across the bounce are much smaller than the bispectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , particularly for squeezed triangles , which are the relevant configurations for this paper .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to assume that the leading contributions to the bispectrum in squeezed configurations are dominated by inflationary non - gaussianity .",
    "we follow some of the ideas presented in ref . @xcite to compute the cmb power modulation arising from coupling with super - hubble scales .",
    "the statistics of the classical bardeen potential @xmath89 for observable scales is modified in the presence of a given long wavelength perturbation @xmath90 if the spectrum is non - gaussian .",

    "these terms vanish if we average over @xmath99 , as it must be , since our model respects these symmetries at the fundamental level .",

    "the momentum dependence of the kernel @xmath96 factorizes for the dominant contributions in a power law for @xmath36 ( except for typical oscillations which are unimportant for our computations and can be averaged ) .",

    "for instance , we find that choosing vacuum initial data for perturbations far into the past of the bounce , significantly decreases the amplitudes of all multipoles",
    ".    there has been some debate based on symmetry arguments about whether a statistically homogeneous and isotropic bispectrum can generate a dipole modulation .",
    "our computation is an example where the answer is in the affirmative .",
