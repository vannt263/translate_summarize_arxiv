    "in the present work for the first time the analytical problem of interaction of a high - intensity laser pulse with plasmas in a frame of a stimulated forward - scattering model has been solved and a new approach to solution of the problem was proposed .",
    "+ the acceleration scheme employing the stimulated backward - scattered wave for particle acceleration in a wakefield is not suitable for particle acceleration because high - intensity lasers have a very short laser pulse length leading to a very short interaction time between the injected electron beam and plasma wave . instead",
    ", our new approach employing the stimulated forward - scattering can provide more durable particle trapping time inside the field of a plasma wave of a much longer length compared o the back - scattered model where electrons just slip off the wave . in eq .",
    "for a breakdown electric field for illustration purpose we took a constant topf field because the exact electric field profile during the instability growth is not known .",
    "however , the time interval during which the breakdown field can be gained is much less than the acceleration time what justifies our choice of the field profile . for a better and detailed research we are planning to run more extensive simulations of the considered phenomena using the * karat * code @xcite . + in order to acquire the maximum acceleration effeciency during the experiment one would need to make the scattered at various angles radiation except the forward - scattered one be absorbed by plasma surrounding surfaces similar to the scheme employed for a shf ( superhigh frequency ) plasma amplifier .",

    "<S> we propose a new approach to high - intensity laser - driven electron acceleration in a plasma . here , we demonstrate that a plasma wave generated by a stimulated forward - scattering of an incident laser pulse can be in a longest acceleration phase with an incident laser wave . </S>",
    "<S> this is why the plasma wave has the maximum amplification coefficient which is determined by the breakdown ( overturn ) electric field in which the acceleration of injected relativistic beam electrons occurs . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate qualitatively the acceleration parameters of relativistic electrons in the field of a plasma wave generated at the stimulated forward scattering of a high - intensity laser pulse in a plasma .    during the past few decades plasma accelerators </S>",
    "<S> have attracted increasing interest of scientists from all over the world due to its compactness , much cheaper construction costs compared to those for conventional one and various applications ranging from high energy physics to medical and industrial applications . </S>",
    "<S> an intense electromagnetic pulse can create a plasma oscillations through the stimulated scattering . </S>",
    "<S> electrons trapped in the plasma wave can be accelerated to high energy . </S>",
    "<S> + the idea to accelerate the charged particles in a plasma medium using collective plasma wave fields generated by the high - energy electron beams belongs to the soviet physicists g. i. budker , v. i. veksler and ia . b. fainberg @xcite in 1956 , whereas assumptions for generation of plasma langmuir waves by nonrelativistic electron bunches propagating through plasma were first made earlier in 1949 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> high - energy bunch electrons generate a plasma wave in such a way that the energy from a bunch of electrons is transferred to the plasma wave through stimulated cherenkov resonance radiation producing high acceleration electric fields . later on , another acceleration scheme using a laser @xcite or time - shifted sequence of bunched high - energy electrons injected into a cold plasma </S>",
    "<S> was proposed @xcite . in recent experiments at the stanford linear accelerator center </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that an energy gain of more than 42 gev was achieved in a meter long plasma wakefield accelerator , driven by a 42 gev electron beam @xcite . for a detailed review about the modern status of this research field </S>",
    "<S> we would like to refer a reader to @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + however , the experiments of the 60s and 70s demonstrated that efficiency of acceleration using the high - energy beams is much less than the expected one and the generated field is much lower than a breakdown ( overturn ) electric field @xcite :    @xmath0    where @xmath1- electron charge , @xmath2 - its mass , @xmath3 - plasma wave phase velocity , @xmath4 where @xmath5 - plasma wave vector , @xmath6 - plasma frequency , @xmath7 with @xmath8 being the electron density and m - its mass . </S>",
    "<S> the explanation for the experiments failure was given in the work @xcite where it was shown that trapping of electrons in a generated by a beam plasma wave occurs and as a result growth of the field amplitude stops when the field amplitude is much less than that of the breakdown field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + with the apperance of the high - intensity lasers in the 80s , a new era of plasma acceleration has begun . </S>",
    "<S> the hopes were feeded by possibility of the stimulated scattering of a laser pulse by plasma electrons in a rare plasma with the generation of high - intensity longitudinal plasma wave where the electron trapping does not occur and , as a result , high fields with respect to the breakdown field @xmath9 can be generated . </S>",
    "<S> however , there are still a lot of unsolved problems related to the development of instabilities hindering the laser - driven plasma - based acceleration @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + we presume that the key issue of the laser - driven plasma - based acceleration is the following : inspite of the fact that the instability induced by the backward ( backwards the laser pulse ) scattering generating a plasma wave or a wake has a maximum increment @xmath10 compared to that generated by a forward ( towards the injection of a laser pulse ) one @xmath11 by @xmath12 times ( @xmath13 - laser pulse frequency ) @xcite ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] ) , this acceleration scheme is not suitable for particle acceleration because such lasers have a very short laser pulse length . since the wave vector of a plasma wave @xmath14 is equal to the double magnitude of that of a laser pulse ( @xmath15 ) , the phase velocity of a plasma wave is quite low . due to this fact the wave leaves behind both the laser and the back scattered waves getting localized at the back to the front of the laser pulse ( </S>",
    "<S> this is why it is called as a wake ) . as a result </S>",
    "<S> the plasma wave gets soon out of the acceleration phase with the laser wave and the electron beam injected into the plasma gets soon out of a phase with the plasma wave what halts the acceleration process . in the range of carried out experiments the acceleration effeciency estimates to not higher than 20 - 50 % </S>",
    "<S> recently , the ` sparc_lab ` facility of infn - lnf in frascati , italy , reported the observation of electrons acceleration with an energy gain of 420 mev ( 300 % ) out of 150 mev injected using a 250 tw laser system ( @xmath16 nm , @xmath17 fs , @xmath18 j ) @xcite ( see fig . [ fig:2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> +    , @xmath19 ( forward - scattered wave ) , @xmath20 - back - scattered wave , where @xmath21 . ]    in this work , we are first to propose another acceleration scheme , namely : a stimulated forward - scattering based plasma acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , on a base of such model we would like to give some explanations for the experiment @xcite . due to the stimulated laser forward - scattering a plasma wave </S>",
    "<S> is generated as well . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the plasma wave and laser wave can stay in acceleration resonance for a much longer time . </S>",
    "<S> + let the laser pulse with langmuir frequency @xmath22 be injected into the cold plasma at @xmath23 . consider the case when @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 - phase velocities of laser , forward - scattered and plasma waves .        here </S>",
    "<S> , we employ the cgs system of units . </S>",
    "<S> the parametric resonance for the stimulated forward - scattering can be written as following : @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath5 are the wave vectors of the incident laser pulse , forward - scattered wave and plasma wave respectively , @xmath13 , @xmath31 - corresponding frequencies : @xmath32 after having solved the system of eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) one can find out that the phase velocities of three waves are equal @xmath33 where @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the condition for the resonance interaction ( [ 3 ] ) can be satisfied for a sufficiently long time until the amplitude of the plasma wave becomes higher than that of the laser incident wave and the reversed process of feeding back the incident wave starts . </S>",
    "<S> if the laser is powerful enough than the instability will keep growing until a breakdown ( overturn ) of the plasma wave occurs , i.e. when the magnitude of the saturation plasma wave amplitude becomes equal to @xmath9 ( see eq . [ 1 ] ) . the acceleration constraint ( [ 4 ] ) enables us to controle the acceleration process . in order to determine the electron trapping condition for acceleration we need to estimate the duration of acceleration , i.e. the time interval during which the phase velocities of a plasma wave and that of an electron remain approximately equal to each other . </S>",
    "<S> this condition possibly was taken into account during the ` sparc_lab ` experiment in frascatti with injected electron beam energies of 150 mev . </S>",
    "<S> + taking into account this condition we can estimate the duration of acceleraion of an ultrarelativistic electron with an initial energy @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the speed of an electron beam . </S>",
    "<S> the speed of such an electron is the following :    @xmath38    using the following estimation formula for acceleration time :    @xmath39    and eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 3 ] ) and ( [ 5 ] ) we can detemine the acceleration time :    @xmath40    taking into account eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ 7 ] ) the following momentum and energy growth can be obtained : @xmath41 let us make some estimations for a laser - driven plasma - based electron accelerator and compare with the results obtained at the ` sparc_lab ` facility of infn - lnf in frascati , italy .    </S>",
    "<S> * * estimated parameters * * @xmath42 s@xmath43 ( @xmath44 nm ) , @xmath45 s@xmath43 , @xmath46 @xmath47 * an electron with energy growth of @xmath48 mev ( @xmath49 ) can gain the maximum energy @xmath50 ev in the saturation field of @xmath51 v / cm during @xmath52 s over the maximum acceleration length of @xmath53 cm . </S>",
    "<S> provided that the length of a capillary could be of the same size : @xmath53 cm , the corresponding energy growth for the ` sparc_lab ` facility can be estimated to much higher energy growth of @xmath54 ev compared to the obtained one . * the acceleration time in a frame of the stimulated back - scattered model can be determined as @xmath55 , @xmath56 s which is much less than that for the forward - scattered case : @xmath57 s by approx . </S>",
