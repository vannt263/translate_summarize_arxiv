    "we expect that , because of surface tension , the wedge becomes rounded so that the surface of the solid becomes a smooth curve of cartesian equation @xmath6 with @xmath7 as @xmath8 .",
    "this last condition expresses that , far from the wedge , surface tension does not generate any laplace s pressure on a flat surface , @xmath9 being the positions in the strained state .",
    "because we have to deal with finite strain ( instead of the usual small strain limit of elastic theory , or hookean limit ) , we need to formalize more than done usually the derivation of the equations of elasticity .",
    "we limit our exposition to the 2d case .",

    "notice too the underlying assumption that , even for the finite deformations we consider , the solid in the deformed state does not cross itself .",
    "this is in principle enforced by imposing that the mapping from @xmath36 to @xmath5 and its inverse are one to one .",
    "the elastic energy is a function of the strain tensor just defined . in the absence of any preferred direction",
    "it must depend on one of the two scalars ( i.e. invariants under global rotation ) that can be made out of the strain tensor .",
    "these are the sum of the square of its components , namely @xmath37 and the trace , @xmath38 .",

    "<S> one parameter only is left , namely the magnitude of the angle at infinity , be it the angle between the two planes in the 2d wedge or , in 3d , the aperture of the cone , if this one has a circular basis . </S>",
    "<S> because of the geometry one can think to two limits for an analytical approach : an almost flat wedge , where the angular deviation from a flat surface is small , and the opposite limit of a sharp wedge where the angle at infinity is very small . </S>",
    "<S> both cases can be treated analytically , with different methods of course . </S>",
    "<S> we expose below the corresponding calculations . in the case of a very sharp wedge </S>",
    "<S> , not surprisingly we have to use a form of lubrication approximation , that is to assume a much faster dependence on the coordinate perpendicular to the axis of symmetry than parallel to it . in the case of an almost flat wedge instead the capillary force , which is proportional to the small angle at the tip is small so that a limit of small strain can be used , and the problem can be dealt with by using linear perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> this makes the problem solvable in principle by using fourier transform , but with some care because of divergences due to the large distance behavior of the perturbation induced by surface tension .    </S>",
    "<S> we outline first the equations of neo - hookean elasticity with surface tension included ( section [ sec : deriv+st ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we use later in section [ sec : wedge ] the linearized hookean form of those equations to derive the deformation induced by surface tension on a shallow wedge . </S>",
    "<S> then , in section [ sec : sharp ] we solve the same problem with a very sharp edge in the rest state . </S>",
    "<S> it ends with a concluding section . </S>"
