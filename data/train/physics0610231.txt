    "solitons are robust localized pulses that have been predicted theoretically and created experimentally in diverse physical settings .",
    "the current research in this field is heavily focused on nonlinear optics @xcite and bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) @xcite .",
    "typical solitons are found in uniform media with constant characteristics .",
    "however , in many cases it is necessary to consider solitary waves ( which are also called  solitons \" , in a loose sense , even if they are not described by integrable equations ) traveling across heterogeneous media , or subjected to strong time modulation .",
    "a well - known example of the former setting is _ dispersion management _ , which is an important concept in fiber - optic telecommunications , helping to support stable soliton trains used as data - carrying streams @xcite . on the other hand , a possibility to stabilize matter - wave solitons by means of the _ nonlinearity management _ , applied to them via the feshbach resonance in a modulated magnetic field ( i.e. , time - periodic variation of the scattering length that determines the coefficient in front of the cubic term in the gross - pitaevskii equation ) , in one - dimensional ( 1d ) @xcite and 2d fatkhulla geometries , has drawn considerable attention in the studies of bec .",
    "another example of a setting supporting the transmission of robust solitons in a strongly heterogeneous periodic system , that combines features of both the dispersion management and nonlinearity management , is the _ split - step model _ ( ssm ) . in the simplest case",
    ", it is composed of periodically alternating pieces of optical fibers with zero dispersion and zero nonlinearity ( i.e. , it is built as a periodic concatenation of nonlinear and dispersive segments , the latter ones taken with anomalous dispersion ) @xcite . in a more realistic variant of the ssm",
    ", the nonlinear and dispersive segments are allowed to have nonvanishing dispersion and nonlinearity , respectively @xcite .",
    "multicomponent generalizations of the ssm were elaborated too , including one for the wdm ( wavelength - division - multiplexed ) system @xcite , and a model taking into regard two polarizations of light @xcite .    in the above - mentioned examples ,",
    "solitons are supported by the cubic nonlinearity of the medium .",
    "it is well known that the quadratic ( second - harmonic - generating , alias @xmath0 ) nonlinearity also gives rise to stable solitons , that have been studied in detail theoretically and experimentally in optics @xcite . in most cases ,",
    "these are _ spatial solitons _ , i.e. , self - supporting localized beams in bulk or ( which is more relevant to the present work ) planar waveguides .",
    "temporal @xmath1 solitons have been created too @xcite , but under very sophisticated conditions .    in terms of bec ,",
    "a counterpart of the second - harmonic generation is the feshbach association in atomic bec @xcite , induced by the coupling of atomic and molecular mean fields ( mfs ) with the help of resonant optical fields or by hyperfine interactions , using the zeeman effect for the mismatch tuning .",
    "quadratic solitons in bec have been predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite . in terms of the comparison with optics , these solitons in bec",
    "may be classified as temporal ones .    in those studies",
    ", it was established that conditions for the existence and stability of @xmath0 solitons are most sensitive to the mismatch between the fundamental - frequency ( ff ) wave and the second harmonic ( sh ) , or , in terms of the bec , between the atomic and molecular mfs .",
    "this fact suggests a natural question , which is the subject of the present paper  how the quadratic solitons will react to a periodic modulation of the mismatch , i.e. ,  mismatch management \" ( mm ) .",
    "the issue is of general interest , as a possible contribution to the theory of the  soliton management \" @xcite , and may also be potentially promising as concerns the use of @xmath0 spatial solitons in optical switching @xcite and other applications to photonics . as for the soliton - management schemes ,",
    "almost all of them were explored in terms of media with the cubic nonlinearity ; the only example dealing with a @xmath0 setting was the model of  tandem solitons \" , which assumed their transmission in a waveguide built as a concatenation of @xmath0and linear segments , in 1d @xcite and 2d @xcite geometry ( actually , the purpose of the tandem model was to reduce the mismatch ) .",
    "a ubiquitous approach to the reduction of mismatch in optical waveguides isbased on the use of the quasi - phase - matching ( qpm )  scheme , in which the material of the @xmath0 waveguide is subjected to periodic poling ( since the material , such as linbo@xmath2 , is a ferroelectric , this is usually carried out through periodic reversal of the orientation of ferroelectric domains ) @xcite .",
    "the poling gives rise to a change of the sign of the @xmath0 coefficient with a certain period , @xmath3 , and thus adds an extra wave vector , @xmath4 , aligned with the propagation direction , @xmath5 , to the relation between the ff  and sh  wave vectors , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , which may be used to cancel the original mismatch , @xmath8 . in terms of this technique , the mm may be implemented by imposing a long - period supermodulation on the qpm poling .    besides its direct relevance to optics , the mm",
    "may also be implemented in the above - mentioned atomic - molecular bec , through the feshbach - management technique . as mentioned above , in terms of bec ,",
    "the application of the latter technique , which is based on the feshbach resonance driven by a modulated magnetic field , to the stabilization of various types of 1d frm , 2d @xcite ( and also 3d @xcite ) matter - wave solitons was theoretically studied in detail for the atomic bec which obeys the gross - pitaevskii equation with the cubic nonlinearity , but no similar results were reported , thus far , for atomic - molecular condensates .",
    "although in the limit of large values of the mismatch a @xmath0 system may be reduced to a @xmath9 limit by means of the well - known cascading approximation , there is a fundamental difference between the systems .",
    "while @xmath10 models may have exact bethe - ansatz solutions @xcite even beyond the mf approximation , the introduction of the sh ( the molecular field ) lifts the integrability @xcite .",
    "thus , we expect effects of mm in @xmath0 systems , at small or moderate values of the mismatch , to be different from earlier studied effects of the nonlinearity management in the @xmath9 model ( in the cascading limit , the @xmath0 mm goes over into the @xmath11nonlinearity management ) .",
    "the objective of the paper is to study solitons and their stability in one - dimensional mm systems , in both the optical and bec realizations .",
    "the mf model , based on a set of partial differential equations , is introduced in sec .",
    "a piecewise - constant periodic modulation of the mismatch parameter in this model is natural in the optical setting .",
    "basic results for solitons in the mf model are collected in sec .",
    "we report stability regions for the solitons , and conditions necessary for their self - trapping from input beams .",
    "interactions between the solitons are considered too , with a conclusion that characteristics of the interactions in the mm system are virtually the same as in its ordinary ( unmodulated ) counterpart .    in sec .",
    "iv , we employ the parametric approximation @xcite , which goes beyond the mean field , and is based on a set of ordinary differential equations , in the case of spatially uniform configurations .",
    "although this model is unable to generate solitons , it allows us to analyze effects of quantum fluctuations , which may be important in both optical @xcite and , especially , bec @xcite realizations of the @xmath0 interactions , as well as relaxation effects , which may appear in the bec due to inelastic collisions . in the framework of this analysis",
    ", we adopt the usual , in terms of the bec , harmonic form of the periodic modulation of the magnetic field which tunes the feshbach resonance , rather than the piecewise - constant format , adopted in the optical model .",
    "numerical solutions of parametric - approximation equations demonstrate that the non - condensate component in the atomic - molecular gas is not essentially excited by the mm , under a natural condition that the modulation frequency is low enough . on the other hand",
    ", the modulation at higher frequencies may lead to destruction of the condensate .",
    "the paper is concluded by sec",
    "in a normalized form , which is widely adopted in nonlinear optics , the fundamental @xmath0 model in one dimension is based on a system of coupled equations for complex local amplitudes of the ff and sh  waves , @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the mismatch parameter [ this coefficient is an irreducible one in the framework of the notation adopted in eqs .",

    "mf equations for atomic - molecular bec in an atomic waveguide , where @xmath17 is directed along the waveguide axis , can be reduced to the form of eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) as well , with @xmath16 being time ( see sec .",
    "[ nonmf ] below ) .    in the notation of eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) , complete matching is attained at @xmath18 , while the single exact analytical solution for the @xmath19 soliton is available at @xmath20,@xmath21(the _ karamzin - sukhorukov _",
    "soliton @xcite ) .",
    "at other values of @xmath15 , solitons were found numerically , as well as in an approximate analytical form , by means of the variational method @xcite .",
    "the simplest model of the mm ( similar , in particular , to that of the dispersion management @xcite ) assumes periodic modulation of @xmath22 according to the following _ map _ ( the latter term follows the pattern of the  dispersion - management map \" @xcite ) :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the average value of @xmath15 , while @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the amplitude and period of the periodic management .",
    "we here assume equal lengths , @xmath27 , of the two segments forming the mm cell .",
    "simulations supplementing those reported below demonstrate that a change of the relative length of the two segments ( with the respective change of the local values of the mismatch in them ) produces little effect on eventual results , quite similar to what is known about the dispersion management dm , book .    while the mm map in the piecewise - constant form of eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) is most natural in terms of optical waveguides , for the application to the atomic - molecular bec a more natural choice is , as mentioned above , the harmonic modulation of the mismatch , corresponding to the periodic time dependence of the magnetic field tuning the feshbach resonance , see eq .",
    "( harmonic ) below .",
    "the experience gained in the studies of various models of the dispersion management @xcite suggests that the piecewise - constant and harmonic formats of the modulation can not lead to qualitatively different results .",
    "equations ( [ 1 ] ) conserve a known integral of motion , viz .",
    ", _ manley - rowe invariant _ , @xmath28 dx ,   \\label{mr}\\]]even in the case of the @xmath16-dependent mismatch parameter , whereas the hamiltonian corresponding to eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) is not conserved .",
    "in addition , in the case of  walking \" solitons @xcite [ in fact , these are spatial solitons tilted in the plane of @xmath29 , eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) with variable @xmath30 conserve the total momentum,@xmath31it is also worthy to note that eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) with @xmath32 are invariant with respect to the spatial galilean boost , hence a generic tilted soliton , @xmath33 can be generated from the straight one by means of the corresponding transformation,@xmath34with an arbitrary real tilt parameter @xmath35 . as follows from eqs .",
    "( [ mr ] ) - ( [ p ] ) , the momentum of the tilted soliton is @xmath36 , i.e. , @xmath35 and @xmath37 play the role of the effective velocity and mass of the soliton .    in the case of the atomic - molecular bec mixture",
    ", the galilean invariance has its literal meaning ( in the temporal , rather than spatial , domain ) .",
    "however , it is broken if the axial trapping potential is taken into regard .",
    "to simulate the transmission of spatial optical solitons under the mm conditions , we solved equations ( [ 1 ] ) with mm map ( [ 2 ] ) by means of the split - step numerical method , which uses the fourier transform to handle the linear stage of the evolution .",
    "as the input ( initial pulse ) , we took either an ordinary soliton corresponding to the averaged version of the model , i.e. , one with @xmath38 , or a deliberately altered pulse , to verify whether the mm system will provide for self - trapping into a stable transmission regime .",
    "below , we display systematic results obtained for @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( comparison with results collected with other values of the average mismatch parameter demonstrate that these two cases adequately represent the generic situation ) .",
    "in particular , for @xmath39 we launched the initial pulse taken as exact solution ( [ karamzin ] ) corresponding to @xmath20 . for @xmath41 , we typically used either a soliton solution found in a numerical form for @xmath42 , or , in order to try the effect of a strong change of the input , we again took expression ( [ karamzin ] ) , i.e. , the exact soliton appertaining to @xmath20 . at a fixed value of @xmath24 , results were collected by varying the mm amplitude @xmath25 and period @xmath26 .",
    "first , in fig . [ fig1 ] we display a typical numerical solution for @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , generated with the use of exact soliton ( [ karamzin ] ) as the initial condition . in this figure , panels ( a ) and ( b ) present the evolution of the ff and sh components of the field .",
    "in fact , in all cases considered , there was no conspicuous difference in the dynamics of the two components , therefore in other cases shown below we only display the picture for the ff beam . as is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the input beam readily gives rise to a robust spatial soliton ( intrinsic pulsations with period @xmath44 , caused by the mm , are almost invisible in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) ; the soliton remains stable in indefinitely long simulations .",
    "the transient stage , necessary for the self - trapping , is fairly short , comprising a few mm cells . in the subsequent evolution , gradually fading residual oscillations of the pulse s amplitude can be seen , with a period covering several cells ( these oscillations are caused by the initial perturbation , rather than the periodic mm ) .",
    "further examples of stable transmission regimes are displayed below in figs .",
    "[ fig3](a ) and ( c ) .",
    "conclusions drawn from systematic simulations are summarized in the stability diagrams , which are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for @xmath46 ( a ) and @xmath40 ( b ) . as",
    "said above , in the former case we launched the pulse corresponding to karamzin - sukhorukov soliton ( karamzin ) , which is an exact solution for @xmath47 , and in the latter case the initial pulse was a numerically found stationary soliton corresponding to @xmath48 @xmath49 .",
    "the diagrams display areas in parameter plane @xmath50 where the initial pulse gives rise to stable transmission , or decay of the pulse [ an example of the latter outcome is displayed below in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) ] . naturally , the stability regions tend to extend along the parameter axes , as , in either limit of @xmath51 or @xmath52 , the model returns to the usual @xmath0 system ( in the case of @xmath52 , this is provided by averaging ) , where the initial pulse represents an ordinary stable soliton .",
    "generally , the instability of the @xmath0 solitons in a part of the parameter space may be realized as a result of a _ resonance _ between the perturbation frequency , introduced by the periodic action of the mm , and the frequency of the intrinsic mode , which , as is well known , @xmath0 solitons have in the system with constant coefficients [ on the contrary to the nonlinear - schrdinger ( nls ) solitons ] @xcite .",
    "indeed , comparison of the numerically found instability border , shown in figs .",
    "fig2(a ) and ( b ) , with values of the intrinsic eigenfrequency , which are known from numerical computations too , demonstrates that the explanation of the instability by the resonance is feasible , although the intrinsic frequency is defined for infinitely small perturbations , while the instability sets in when the solitons are strongly perturbed .",
    "it is also relevant to note that , in the limit of large positive values of mismatch @xmath15 , the sh ( or the molecular mf , in terms of bec ) can be eliminated from eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) by means of the well - known cascading approximation , @xmath53 , reducing the @xmath0 system to the single nls equation .",
    "the same is valid when the large mismatch is subjected to the management [ provided that @xmath30 does not change its sign ] . in that case , the cascading limit will lead ( as mentioned above ) to the nls equation featuring periodic _",
    "nonlinearity management _ book .",
    "in fact , solitons in the latter equation and their stability were investigated in some detail in various contexts @xcite .",
    "in particular , a resonant mechanism of the destabilization of higher - order solitons ( bound states of fundamental solitons ) under the action of the nonlinearity management , qualitatively similar to one outlined above , has been demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a noteworthy feature of the diagrams is the presence of an _ instability enclave _ inside the stability area . in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , the enclave is shown symbolically by a square , as exact delineation of its borders requires extremely long simulations . in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) , the borders of the enclave approximately correspond to its real shape .",
    "it may be relevant to mention that examination of similar stability diagrams in the above - mentioned ssm had revealed a different but somewhat similar feature , viz .",
    ", a system of _ stability islands _ inside the instability area at large values of @xmath26 @xcite . in the present mm model , the simulations do not reveal stability islands ( on the other hand , no  instability lakes \" , that would be similar to the enclaves in fig .",
    "[ karamzin ] , were found inside the stability area in the ssm ) .",
    "we surmise that there may exist additional small instability enclaves , and , in principle , they may even form a fractal pattern . however , an accurate investigation of these issues requires extremely high numerical accuracy , and they are left beyond the scope of this work .",
    "the existence of the instability enclave is further illustrated by a set of simulations presented in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , which are performed along a vertical line , @xmath54 , cutting through the enclave in fig .",
    "a notable difference is observed in the self - trapping into stable transmission regimes below and above the instability region : in the former case , at @xmath55 ( which is close to the instability border ) , the established pulse is very different from the input , due to considerable radiation loss in the process of the establishment of the stable - transmission regime ( in the sh component of the wave field , which is not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , an approximately the same degree of the loss is observed ) .",
    "it is relevant to mention that the formation of stable solitons in the ssm may also be accompanied by strong losses , depending on parameters of the system and the form of the input @xcite . on the other hand , above the instability enclave , the loss is small , and the established soliton is closer to the input , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) ( the same is observed in the sh counterpart of the latter figure , which is not shown here ) .",
    "another noteworthy feature revealed by the simulations is great tolerance of the spatial solitons established in the mm system to variance of the input beam . in particular , if the input launched into the system with @xmath56 was deliberately taken in the ",
    "wrong \" form of expressions ( karamzin ) ( recall they would yield an exact solution for the averaged equations with @xmath20 , rather than @xmath42 ) , the simulations , performed for various values of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , produced a stability diagram nearly identical to that shown in fig . [",
    "fig2](b ) .",
    "it is natural to expect that decrease of the input power will eventually lead to a failure in the self - trapping of the spatial soliton , i.e. , there must exist a certain power threshold for the soliton formation . to find it , we performed additional simulations with the inputs similar to those used above [ in particular , waveform ( [ karamzin ] ) was taken for @xmath39 ] , but multiplied by a power - reducing factor , @xmath58 : @xmath59it was found that the critical value of @xmath60 , below which the thus altered input pulse ( [ karamzin ] ) fails to generate a stable soliton is @xmath61 ( in fact , it is close to a critical value that can be found numerically in the ordinary @xmath0 system , with @xmath62 ) .",
    "figures [ fig4](a , b ) show what happens when @xmath60 is taken , respectively , above and below @xmath63 .",
    "it was also checked that the change of the distribution of the manley - rowe invariant [ see eq .",
    "( [ mr ] ) ] between the two components of the input beam virtually does not affect the self - trapping threshold ( in particular , one may start with the entire power put in the ff field , while @xmath64 ) .",
    "the ordinary @xmath0 system , with @xmath65 , features a similar property @xcite .",
    "we have also performed systematic simulations of interactions between solitons in the mm model .",
    "it was found that the character of the interaction remains virtually the same as in the ordinary @xmath0 model with constant mismatch , that was studied in detail in earlier works @xcite .",
    "the main characteristic of the interaction is a minimum initial separation between co - propagating identical in - phase solitons , @xmath66 , which is defined so that the solitons do not demonstrate any interaction for @xmath67 , while , being placed at distance @xmath68 , they start to attract each other and eventually merge into a single beam .",
    "a typical example displayed in fig . [ fig5 ] shows that the interaction indeed seems identical in the mm system and its ordinary counterpart .",

    "in this work , we have proposed a model of the second - harmonic - generating ( @xmath142 ) system with the mismatch parameter subjected to the periodic modulation (  mismatch management \" , mm ) .",
    "the system may be implemented in two altogether different physical contexts : the co - propagation of the ff ( fundamental - frequency ) and sh(second - harmonic ) waves in a planar optical waveguide , and atomic - molecular mixtures in the bec ( in the latter setting , the atomic and molecular mean fields play the roles of the ff and sh components , respectively ) .",
    "the most physically relevant approach to the realization of the mm in these media are , respectively , a long - period supermodulation imposed on top of the quasi - phase - matching periodic arrangement of ferroelectric domains in the @xmath142 optical waveguide , such as linbo@xmath2 , and the feshbach resonance tuned by a modulated magnetic field in the atomic - molecular bec .",
    "accordingly , the natural form of the periodic modulation is piecewise - constant in the former case , and harmonic in the latter one .    the main issue considered in the framework of the mean - field approach was identification of the stability region for the mismatch - managed spatial solitons in the plane of two control parameters , @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( the mm amplitude and period ) . in particular , a notable feature of the stability area is the existence of an instability enclave embedded in it .",
    "also investigated was the robustness of the solitons against variation of the shape of the input beam , and reduction of its power .",
    "it was found that the stability of the established regime virtually does not depend on the particular shape of the input , as well as on distribution of the total power ( manley - rowe invariant ) between the ff and sh component in the input . on the other hand , reduction of the initial peak power by a factor of @xmath58",
    "reveals the existence of a threshold , @xmath143 , below which the initial pulse decays .    in the model of the atomic - molecular bec",
    ", we have demonstrated that the time - evolution equations for the mean fields are tantamount to the spatial - evolution equations in the optical model . on the other hand ,",
    "important issues in the context of bec are the stability of the condensate against generation of fluctuational ( non - condensate ) components in the degenerate quantum gas , and losses due to inelastic collisions .",
    "these effects were analyzed within the parametric approximation , which goes beyond the mean - field description .",
    "numerical calculations have demonstrated that , quite naturally , the condensate is effectively stable against the periodic perturbations introduced by the mm in the low - frequency modulation format , and unstable in the high - frequency regime .",
