    "in a previous paper  @xcite , a new definition of a wigner distribution function for a finite quantum system  @xcite was developed , in particular for a quantum system in which the position operator @xmath1 has a finite multiplicity - free spectrum @xmath2 and the momentum operator @xmath3 also has a finite multiplicity - free spectrum @xmath4 .",
    "when the system is in a stationary state @xmath5 ( i.e.  the eigenstate of some hamiltonian operator @xmath6 ; @xmath7 ) , the corresponding wigner function @xmath8 is defined on a square grid @xmath9 , so it can be considered as an @xmath10 matrix ( the wigner matrix ) .",
    "the assumption in  @xcite is that  as in the continuous case  @xcite  the distribution averages for all `` physical observables '' of the form @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) coincide with their quantum state averages for the corresponding operator form ( following weyl s association scheme ) .",
    "this approach led to a procedure to compute wigner matrices , involving vandermonde matrices and their inverses .",
    "the wigner matrices or discrete functions thus defined also satisfy a number of properties similar to those of continuous wigner distribution functions .",
    "one of the simplest examples of a finite quantum system is the so - called @xmath0 finite oscillator model , introduced by atakishiyev _",
    "et al _  @xcite . for this oscillator ,",
    "the physical operators ( hamiltonian , position , momentum ) are elements of @xmath0 , acting in a finite ( irreducible ) @xmath0 representation of dimension @xmath13 ( where @xmath14 is a nonnegative integer ) .",
    "the position and momentum operators have as spectrum the set @xmath15 , and the corresponding discrete wavefunctions are given in terms of krawtchouk polynomials . for @xmath16 , these wavefunctions ( after rescaling ) tend to the common continuous wavefunctions of the harmonic oscillator in terms of hermite functions .    in  @xcite ,",
    "the discrete wigner function for the @xmath0 oscillator was computed for some particular values of @xmath14 , and the matrix plots of these functions were considered .",
    "this led to quite remarkable observations , in particular when compared to plots of continuous wigner functions for the canonical oscillator .",
    "the @xmath0 finite oscillator model is so simple that we can not be satisfied just with some numerical computations and plots of the discrete wigner functions .",
    "instead , one should be able to give explicit values @xmath17 for the elements of the wigner matrix ( as a function of @xmath14 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) .",
    "this problem is the topic of the current paper , and turns out to lead to interesting mathematics .",
    "in fact , we have more than one solution for it .",
    "one approach is based on special functions ( hypergeometric series ) , and follows in a rather straightforward way from `` basis transformations '' .",
    "the second approach is combinatorial .",
    "we shall see that the elements of the wigner matrix ( or , more precisely , the pre - wigner matrix , to be defined in the following section ) coincide with ( the evaluation of ) dyck polynomials .",
    "a dyck polynomial is a multi - variable polynomial `` counting '' all dyck paths of a certain type .",
    "these dyck paths themselves are simple combinatorial objects appearing in many contexts .    in the following section we recall the definition of the wigner function for a finite quantum system and for the @xmath0 finite oscillator . in section  3",
    "we shall compute the matrix elements of the pre - wigner matrix using basis transformations , and obtain an expression in terms of @xmath21-series or krawtchouk polynomials . in section  4 ,",
    "we introduce dyck paths ( which are known ) and the corresponding dyck polynomials ( which are new ) .",
    "we illustrate these combinatorial objects with some examples , which help to understand them . in section  5",
    "we resume the computation of the pre - wigner matrix for the @xmath0 finite oscillator , and see that this is indeed related to dyck polynomials .",
    "for a one - dimensional quantum system , let @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 denote the hamiltonian , the position and the momentum operator .",
    "for a finite quantum system , one assumes that @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are self - adjoint elements of some algebra ( with a @xmath25-operation ) , and that the unitary representations of this algebra are finite - dimensional .",
    "when these operators moreover satisfy the hamilton - lie equations @xmath26",
    "= -\\ii \\hat p$ ] , @xmath27 = \\ii \\hat q$ ] , and when @xmath22 has an equidistant spectrum , the quantum system is referred to as a finite quantum oscillator  @xcite .",
    "we shall recall some general notation and concepts , introduced in  @xcite . consider a representation space @xmath28 of dimension @xmath29 , and denote the ( normalized ) eigenvectors of @xmath22 by @xmath5 , with @xmath30 ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "@xmath28 is a hilbert space , and @xmath31 .",
    "these eigenvectors are referred to as the stationary states . in the basis @xmath5 ( @xmath7 ) ,",
    "the operators @xmath23 and @xmath24 are represented by hermitian matrices , whose eigenvalues are real and correspond to the finite spectrum of these operators , or the `` possible position and momentum values '' .",
    "let us denote the eigenvalues of @xmath23 by @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) , and the corresponding ( orthonormal ) eigenvectors by @xmath34 .",
    "we shall assume that all eigenvalues are different and simple ( i.e.  non - degenerate spectra ) .",
    "so we have the following situation : @xmath35 the expansion of the ( orthonormal ) @xmath23 eigenstates in the basis @xmath5 ( @xmath7 ) is denoted by @xmath36 and the inverse relation reads @xmath37 the discrete function @xmath38 , defined for @xmath39 , can be interpreted as the position wavefunction when the system is in the @xmath18th stationary state  @xcite .",
    "completely similar , we shall assume that the eigenvalues of @xmath24 are given by the mutually distinct values @xmath40 ( @xmath33 ) , and denote the corresponding ( orthonormal ) eigenvectors by @xmath41 .",
    "so @xmath42 ( @xmath33 ) , and we denote @xmath43 ( @xmath33 ) .    in the continuous case , the wigner function @xmath44 is a distribution function in @xmath45-phase space such that the expectation value for a classical phase space function @xmath46 coincides with the quantum mechanical expectation value of the suitably ordered operator expression @xmath47 for the @xmath18th stationary state . in the discrete case ,",
    "the wigner function @xmath17 is ( for every @xmath18 ) a function of the discrete values @xmath48 such that  @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath46 is supposed to be a polynomial expression in @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and @xmath52 is the corresponding operator expression according to weyl s association",
    ".    it will be convenient to represent the wigner distribution function as an @xmath10 matrix @xmath53 with matrix elements @xmath54    recall that for a monomial function @xmath55 , denoted by @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) , the corresponding operator function would be given by @xmath58 the last notation stands for taking the coefficient of @xmath59 in the expansion of @xmath60 .",
    "the technique to construct the discrete wigner function or matrix was then analyzed in  @xcite .",
    "first , one should determine a pre - wigner matrix @xmath61 by @xmath62 then , the actual wigner matrix @xmath63 is given by @xmath64 herein , @xmath65 stands for the @xmath10 vandermonde matrix corresponding to the values @xmath66 , @xmath67 for the inverse of a matrix @xmath68 , and @xmath69 for the inverse of the transpose of a matrix @xmath68 . since the inverses of vandermonde matrices are known explicitly  ( * ? ? ? * lemma  1 ) , it is sufficient to compute the pre - wigner matrices @xmath70 .",
    "let us now turn to the example for which we wish to compute the pre - wigner matrices @xmath70 explicitly , the @xmath0 oscillator model  @xcite .",
    "in terms of the standard @xmath0 basis @xmath71 ( with commutation relations @xmath72=\\pm j_\\pm$ ] , @xmath73=2j_0 $ ] ) , and working in the representation space @xmath74 labeled by a nonnegative integer of half - integer @xmath14 ( @xmath75 ) , the hamiltonian , position and momentum operators are defined by @xmath76 the basis states of @xmath77 in the `` angular momentum '' notation are @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) , with the well known action @xmath80 thus also the matrices of @xmath24 and @xmath23 in this basis are clear from this action . following the earlier notation , we have @xmath81 , and the hamiltonian eigenstates are denoted by @xmath82 the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath23 ( and @xmath24 ) have been determined in  @xcite .",
    "one has @xmath83 with ( following the notation of  ) @xmath84 herein , @xmath85 is the krawtchouk polynomial  @xcite : @xmath86 so the discrete position wavefunctions are symmetric ( i.e.  with @xmath87 ) krawtchouk polynomials .",
    "for some plots of these discrete wavefunctions , we refer to  @xcite . in  @xcite ,",
    "we have computed ( numerically ) some examples of wigner matrices @xmath88 for this @xmath0 case , and given some matrix plots of these discrete wigner functions .",
    "these plots are interesting , and the shapes of the discrete plots are reminiscent of the shapes of the continuous plots for the canonical oscillator .    given the importance of this example , it would be interesting to find general expressions for the matrix elements of the wigner matrix @xmath88 or of the pre - wigner matrix @xmath70 .",
    "this is the purpose of the current paper .",
    "the first solution is presented in the next section .",
    "surprisingly , there is also a combinatorial solution , related to dyck paths .",
    "this will be discussed in sections  45 .",
    "the purpose of this section is the explicit calculation of @xmath89 , given by   and  , for the @xmath0 oscillator model with @xmath3 and @xmath1 given by   with action   in the representation space @xmath77 of dimension @xmath90 .",
    "note that , using the notation   for the basis of the representation space , we have @xmath91 following   and , we need to compute diagonal entries of powers of @xmath92 .",
    "note that @xmath93 where @xmath94 consider @xmath95 for some positive power @xmath96 .",
    "due to the simple action  , comparing terms with the same ordered string of @xmath97 s and @xmath98 s in the expansion of @xmath99 and of @xmath100 it is easy to see that @xmath101 for @xmath102 ( and @xmath103 ) .",
    "since we only need diagonal elements of powers of @xmath104 , we can restrict to even powers ( the odd powers having zeros on the diagonal , by  ) . for even powers , yields @xmath105 so using , and this expansion , one can see that @xmath89 is nonzero only for even values of the indices @xmath106 and @xmath107 , and that @xmath108 hence the computation is reduced to calculating diagonal entries of even powers of @xmath1 in the @xmath5-basis .",
    "performing the basis transformation  , this gives ( for @xmath109 ) : @xmath110 and thus by the action   and orthogonality : @xmath111 since @xmath112 is a krawtchouk polynomial and @xmath113 , one can use   and   to find the following equivalent expressions : @xmath114 so this gives us explicit expressions for the matrix elements   of the pre - wigner matrix @xmath70 .    as a simple example ,",
    "let us consider the pre - wigner matrix @xmath115 for the ground state , that gives rise to the ground state wigner matrix using  .",
    "using   yields : @xmath116 is nonzero only for even values of the indices @xmath106 and @xmath107 and @xmath117    eqs .   and  , together with the explicit expressions of the vandermonde matrix inverses , give an explicit expression for the wigner matrix @xmath88 for the @xmath0 finite oscillator .",
    "next to this solution in terms of multiple sum expressions , we can present a second solution in terms of combinatorial quantities .",
    "this is the subject of the following sections .",
    "a _ dyck path @xmath50 of size @xmath96 _ is a lattice path from @xmath118 to @xmath119 in the integer plane consisting of @xmath96 up steps of the form @xmath120 and @xmath96 down steps of the form @xmath121 which never passes below the @xmath122-axis  @xcite .",
    "an example of a dyck path of size @xmath123 is given in figure  1 .",
    "clearly , one can encode such a dyck path by a _",
    "dyck word _ describing the up steps by the letter @xmath124 and the downs steps by the letter @xmath125 .",
    "so the dyck path of figure  1 has @xmath126 as dyck word .",
    "formally , a dyck word of size @xmath96 is a word consisting of @xmath96 letters @xmath124 and @xmath96 letters @xmath125 in such a way that ( counting from the left ) the @xmath124 count is always greater than or equal to the @xmath125 count .",
    "we will denote by @xmath127 the set of all dyck paths of size @xmath96 ( and by @xmath128 the set consisting of the empty path only ) . in figure  2 , we have listed all elements of @xmath129 ; alternatively , these could be described by the words  @xcite @xmath130 it is well known that the number of dyck paths of size @xmath96 is equal to the catalan number @xmath131 .",
    "various parameters can be defined for dyck paths  @xcite .",
    "height _ of a dyck path @xmath50 is the largest @xmath132 for which @xmath50 touches the line @xmath133 . in figure  1",
    ", the height is @xmath134 . in figure  2 ,",
    "the heights are given by @xmath135 and @xmath136 respectively .",
    "clearly , all elements of @xmath127 have height less than or equal to @xmath96 .",
    "we denote by @xmath137 the subset of @xmath127 consisting of all elements with height at most @xmath138 .",
    "the notation @xmath137 refers to `` restricting '' to certain elements of @xmath127 .",
    "so @xmath139 . from figure  1",
    ", one can see that @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "we need to consider one further extension ( with elements corresponding to a subset of @xmath137 ) . for a given @xmath96 , and integer values @xmath143 with @xmath144 , let us consider the dyck paths starting with at least @xmath106 up steps and ending with at least @xmath107 down steps .",
    "in figure  3 we list the dyck paths of size @xmath145 with @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "we denote by @xmath148 the set of all dyck paths of size @xmath96 and of height at most @xmath138 , starting with at least @xmath106 ups and ending with at least @xmath107 downs .",
    "so the elements of @xmath149 are given in figure  3 .",
    "note that , clearly , @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "now we shall introduce a new notion for a dyck path @xmath50 , namely the _ weight @xmath152 _ of @xmath50 .",
    "an up step of a dyck path having end points at the integer coordinates @xmath153 and @xmath154 is said to be at _",
    "level @xmath19_. it is convenient to label the integer intervals on the @xmath155-axis by variables @xmath156 , where the index @xmath19 in @xmath157 refers to the level .",
    "in fact , this has been done already in figures 13 .",
    "the weight of a path @xmath50 is the product over all variables @xmath158 , in such a way that each up step at level @xmath19 in @xmath50 contributes a factor @xmath157 .",
    "for example , for the path @xmath50 in figure  1 , @xmath159 , since there are in total two up steps at level  1 and three up steps at level  2 .",
    "the weights of the paths in figure  2 are , respectively : @xmath160 the weights of the paths in figure  3 are @xmath161 clearly , each dyck word as in   corresponds to a weight as in  . in principle , one could extend the notion of weight by introducing next to the `` up variables '' @xmath162 also `` down variables '' @xmath163 . then each dyck word would correspond to a monomial in the variables @xmath158 and in the variables @xmath164 .",
    "this extension would not give extra information , however , since `` what goes up must come down '' .",
    "for this reason , we shall not consider this extension here and work with `` up variables '' @xmath158 only .",
    "finally , we define the _ dyck polynomial _ @xmath165 as the sum of the weights of all elements of @xmath148 : @xmath166 for convenience , we shall use a simpler notation for those polynomials corresponding to non - restricted dyck paths ( i.e.  with no restriction on height and/or on the start and end ) : @xmath167 from the previous examples , one can see : @xmath168    let us list some properties of these polynomials .",
    "first of all , the elements of @xmath137 are those of @xmath169 of height at most @xmath138 . the weights of the elements of @xmath170 have factors @xmath171 . so by putting @xmath172 in @xmath173 , one obtains @xmath174 : @xmath175 clearly , this is also valid for @xmath176 for this reason , it will be sufficient to study @xmath177 , and thus work with dyck paths of size @xmath96 that are not restricted in height .",
    "secondly , we can give a recurrence relation for these polynomials .",
    "consider first the standard dyck paths of @xmath178 , with @xmath179 , the catalan number .",
    "these catalan numbers satisfy @xmath180 one proof of this recurrence is as follows : the dyck paths of size @xmath181 are obtained by `` raising '' a dyck path of size @xmath132 by one level and concatenating with a dyck path of size @xmath182 .",
    "( in terms of the dyck word , raising means adding one letter @xmath124 in front and one letter @xmath125 at the end . )",
    "this same proof gives rise to : @xmath183 so in this relation the indices of the variables in @xmath184 are raised by 1 .",
    "the first few polynomials are given by @xmath185    in a similar way , one obtains a recurrence relation for @xmath177 .",
    "first of all , note that obviously @xmath186 furthermore , since all dyck paths start with at least one up step and end with at least one down step , one has @xmath187 the previous concatenating procedure then gives rise to , for @xmath188 or @xmath189 : @xmath190 note that the sum over @xmath132 in   runs in fact from @xmath191 to @xmath192 ( for @xmath132 from 0 to @xmath193 , @xmath194 due to  ; for @xmath132 from @xmath195 to @xmath196 , @xmath197 for the same reason ) .",
    "the recurrence relations   and  , together with the boundary conditions  , and , can easily be used to compute the dyck polynomials @xmath198 by means of a computer algebra package .",
    "we close this section with another relation between the dyck polynomials , which will be useful in the following section .    for @xmath199 and @xmath200 , one has @xmath201",
    "* consider first the left hand side ( lhs ) of  .",
    "as obviously @xmath202 , the lhs is precisely the sum of the weights of all elements of @xmath203 .",
    "hence , this consists of the weights of all dyck paths of size @xmath204 that end with at least @xmath107 down steps and start with at least @xmath106 but at most @xmath205 up steps .",
    "now it suffices to note that the sum of the weights of the elements of @xmath203 can also be computed in another way .",
    "a path in @xmath203 has to start with @xmath106 up steps . if the next step is also an up step we have a path starting with @xmath205 up steps , which necessitates the subsequent step to be a down step .",
    "this leaves  removing the up step starting at @xmath206 and the down step starting at @xmath207 , and putting the loose ends together  a remaining path of size @xmath181 starting with at least @xmath106 up steps and ending with at least @xmath107 steps down .",
    "the sum of the weights of the corresponding paths in @xmath203 is then exactly equal to @xmath208 if we have a path with @xmath106 up steps followed by a down step , the subsequent step can be either up or down .",
    "if this last step is up , this leaves a remaining path of size @xmath181 starting at with at least @xmath106 ups and ending with at least @xmath107 downs .",
    "the sum of the weights of all paths of this type is @xmath209 in a similar way , the sum of the weights of all the remaining paths is equal to @xmath210 which completes the proof .",
    "note that the relation   remains valid for @xmath211 and @xmath212 , provided one takes into account  - and @xmath213 .",
    "let us now turn to a combinatorial computation of @xmath89 for the @xmath0 oscillator model in the representation space @xmath77 of dimension @xmath90 . for this purpose",
    ", it will be helpful to generalize the operators @xmath97 and @xmath98 in   and to introduce new operators denoted by a tilde : @xmath214 where @xmath158 are variables with boundaries @xmath215 .",
    "so under the substitution @xmath216 the tilde - operators become the genuine operators that we need to use .",
    "we can think of all these operators as @xmath10-matrices relative to the ordered basis @xmath217 of the representation space @xmath77 .",
    "we now consider the extension of the other operators , also denoted by a tilde .",
    "thus , as in  , @xmath218 and @xmath219 , @xmath220 and following   and @xmath221 just as in section  3 , we need to compute diagonal entries of powers of @xmath222 , where @xmath223 with @xmath224 and @xmath225 given in  . the same argument as in   leads to @xmath226 for @xmath102 ( and @xmath103 ) .",
    "the diagonal elements of odd powers of @xmath222 are zero , and for the diagonal elements of even powers we find , as in  : @xmath227 by using and , one can see that @xmath228 is nonzero only for even values of the indices @xmath106 and @xmath107 , and that @xmath229 in this case , the problem is reduced to computing diagonal elements of even powers of the tridiagonal matrix @xmath230 our main result is that diagonal elements of ( even ) powers of @xmath231 are precisely given by dyck polynomials : @xmath232 this follows from the following theorem , which makes a connection between all matrix elements of even powers of the matrix @xmath231 and dyck polynomials .",
    "[ theoy ] let @xmath231 be the matrix   and @xmath96 a positive integer .",
    "for @xmath233 and @xmath234 even , we have @xmath235 whereas for @xmath234 odd we have @xmath236 .",
    "taking all material together , we arrive at the following expression for the matrix elements of the pre - wigner matrix : @xmath237 using the substitution  .",
    "* proof of theorem  [ theoy ] .",
    "* we shall prove   by induction on @xmath96 .",
    "let us first consider the case @xmath238 .",

    "when @xmath243 we distinguish between the possible cases .",
    "for @xmath244 there are two possible dyck paths of size @xmath205 starting with at least @xmath106 up steps and ending with at least @xmath106 down steps .",
    "the weights of these paths are respectively @xmath245 and @xmath246 .",
    "hence , we find @xmath247 so these match with the entries in  . for @xmath248 , there is only one possible dyck path of size @xmath249 starting with at least @xmath106 up steps and ending with at least @xmath249 down steps , which has associated weight @xmath250 .",
    "this leads to @xmath251 matching with the corresponding entries in  .",

    "now we can use the induction hypothesis , and assume that   holds for @xmath253 .",
    "next , we prove it then holds for @xmath181 .",
    "the general matrix elements of @xmath254 are computed as follows : @xmath255 using   ( which is obviously also valid after restriction to @xmath256 variables ) , this gives @xmath257 the `` boundary '' matrix elements of @xmath254 are computed similarly .",
    "in a previous paper  @xcite , the notion of wigner function for a finite quantum system was approached in a new way .",

    "the reason is that one should have some ` functional ' expression like   for @xmath8 with @xmath272 , before one can make the replacements @xmath263 , @xmath264 . in our formulas , this is obstructed by the vandermonde matrix inverses in  , for which there is an expression as matrix elements but not as functions of @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "let us conclude with some remarks that are of mathematical nature .",
    "first of all , note that others have also considered polynomials associated with the set of dyck paths @xmath127 .",
    "a particular interesting polynomial  let us denote it here by @xmath273  was introduced and studied in  @xcite ( in a more general setting ) .",
    "herein , a _",
    "@xmath124-segment _ of a path @xmath50 in @xmath127 is defined as a maximal sequence of consecutive up - steps in @xmath50 .",
    "let @xmath274 be the number of @xmath124-segments of length  @xmath132 in  @xmath50 , and @xmath275 for example , for @xmath276 , consider the five dyck paths given in figure  2 .",
    "the first path has one @xmath124-segment of length  3 , the second path has one @xmath124-segment of length  2 and one of length  1 , etc .",
    "so the five terms in   are , respectively , @xmath277 , @xmath278 , @xmath278 , @xmath278 and @xmath279 , or : @xmath280 clearly , the polynomials @xmath273 are not the same as our dyck polynomials @xmath281 .",
    "both are in a way generating functions , but counting quite different statistics : in @xmath281 the _ height _ of each up - step is the crucial characteristic , whereas in @xmath273 the length of consecutive up - steps is determinative .",
    "so the two polynomials are very different in nature , and we can not expect them to be related .",
    "note that for @xmath273 there is an expression in terms of partial bell polynomials  @xcite .",
    "for @xmath281 there is  as shown in this paper  a relation with powers of a particular tridiagonal matrix @xmath231 .",
    "secondly , for the standard dyck polynomials introduced in section  4 , one can consider the generating function @xmath282 multiplying the recurrence relation   by @xmath283 and summing over all @xmath284 then gives : @xmath285 so @xmath286 and repeated use of this leads to @xmath287 clearly , for dyck paths restricted to height @xmath256 and the corresponding dyck polynomials restricted to @xmath256 variables , the generating function @xmath288 becomes @xmath289    as a third remark , note that in this context the symmetric matrix @xmath231 in   appears naturally .",
    "but of course , one can write @xmath290 , with @xmath291 and @xmath292 in this way , one gets rid of the square roots , and for @xmath234 even it follows from   that the matrix elements of even powers of @xmath293 are essentially dyck polynomials : @xmath294    examining the shape of @xmath293 leads to an obvious extension to more general tridiagonal matrices , namely @xmath295 this is related to extensions of dyck paths to motzkin paths  @xcite , where apart from up and down steps also horizontal steps are allowed .",
    "one can define the corresponding motzkin polynomials in a similar way as in  , and then identify matrix elements of powers of @xmath296 to specific motzkin polynomials .",
    "this study will be developed elsewhere .",
