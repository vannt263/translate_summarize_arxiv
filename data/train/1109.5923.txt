    "the translations of @xmath45 have their fixed point on the boundary and not in @xmath45 .",
    "so let @xmath47 and @xmath48 be non - trivial hyperbolic rotations around distinct axes intersecting in the point @xmath49 . then @xmath50 is again a hyperbolic rotation around a third distinct axis passing through @xmath51 . obviously , these rotation axes constitute the fixed point sets @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "hence the only fixed point of the group generated by  @xmath47 and  @xmath48 is  @xmath51 .",
    "now lemma [ fantechigoettscheformula ] yields the following fibre dimension for the obstruction bundle on @xmath55 : @xmath56 after computing degree shifting numbers using lemma [ rotationage ] , we see that this fibre dimension is zero .",
    "hence the obstruction bundle is trivial , and its top chern class is the neutral element of the cohomological cup product . by fantechi ",

    "let @xmath57 be a bianchi group . in 1892 , luigi  @xcite computed fundamental domains for some of these groups .",
    "such a fundamental domain has the shape of a hyperbolic polyhedron ( up to a missing vertex at certain cusps , which represent the ideal classes of @xmath5 ) , so we will call it the _ fundamental polyhedron_.    it is well - known @xcite that any element of  @xmath7 fixing a point inside real hyperbolic 3-space @xmath42 acts as a rotation of finite order .",
    "hence the induced action of  @xmath7 on complex hyperbolic 3-space @xmath45 is proper . for the remainder of this section , as well as theorems  [ 3-torsion quotients ] and  [ 2-torsion quotients ] , we will reduce all our considerations to the action on real hyperbolic 3-space @xmath42 .",

    "we achieve this by computing bianchi s fundamental polyhedron for the action of  @xmath7 , taking as preliminary set of 2-cells its facets lying on the euclidean hemispheres and vertical planes of the upper - half space model for @xmath42 , and then subdividing along the rotation axes of the elements of  @xmath7 .",
