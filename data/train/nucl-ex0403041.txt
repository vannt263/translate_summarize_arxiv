    "the accelerator cebaf at jefferson lab provides up to @xmath0 electrons to three experimental halls .",
    "hall b houses the large acceptance spectrometer clas , which is designed to study multi - particle final - state reactions induced by photons and electrons at luminosities up to @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 .",
    "the charged particle momentum is analyzed using a 1 t toroidal magnetic field with azimuthal symmetry generated by six superconducting coils arranged around the beamline .",
    "each sector between two coils acts as a single spectrometer instrumented with three layers of drift chambers ( dc ) for track reconstruction , one layer of scintillator counters for time - of - flight measurement ( tof ) , a gas filled cherenkov counter ( cc ) and an electromagnetic shower calorimeter ( ec ) .",
    "drift chambers and time - of - flight define the sensitive region of each sector in the range of the polar angle @xmath4 from @xmath5 to @xmath6 , the forward calorimeter modules cover from @xmath5 to @xmath7 in each sector and the two modules of the large - angle calorimeter ( lac ) extend the @xmath4 coverage up to @xmath8 in two clas sectors . in 1998",
    "the two lac modules as a part of the clas detector have been commissioned and since then they have been successfully operating to run the hall b experimental program with electron and photon beams .",
    "the main features of the lac module have been already described in previous papers where we reported the properties of the main components as the plastic scintillators @xcite , the light guides @xcite and the photomultipliers @xcite . the detector structure and the response to minimum ionizing particle has been described in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    "we report on the response of the lac to charged and neutral particles .",
    "the results are based on data taken with both an electron and a photon beam impinging on a cryogenic target filled with liquid hydrogen or liquid deuterium .",
    "we first discuss the energy and timing response obtained from the detection of pions and protons .",
    "after that we show the performances for neutral particles : photons and neutrons .",
    "to discuss the energy and timing responses , we first give a brief description of the detector .",
    "the conceptual drawing of the internal structure is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lacstructure ] : the lac module has a rectangular shape with a sensitive area of 217x400 @xmath9 and the internal structure is made of 33 layers , each composed of a 0.20 @xmath10 thick lead foil and 1.5 @xmath10 thick ne110a plastic scintillator bars .",
    "each scintillator layer is protected from the contact with the lead by thin teflon foils .",
    "the width of the scintillators is roughly 10 @xmath10 and is slightly increasing from the inner layers toward the outer layers to provide a focusing geometry .",
    "scintillators in consecutive layers are rotated by @xmath11 to form a 40x24 matrix of cells with area approximately 10x10 @xmath9 .",
    "the module is vertically divided into an inner ( 17 layers ) and an outer ( 16 layers ) parts with separate light readouts .",
    "scintillators lying one on top of the other with the same orientation form a stack .",
    "the focusing geometry is such that any straight trajectory that originates from the target would hit two crossing stacks both in the inner part as well in the outer part . for each stack",
    "the light is collected at both ends separately using light guides coupled to emi 9954a photomultipliers . for each module",
    "there are 128 stacks and 256 photomultipliers .",
    "the energy calibration is performed continuosly checking off - line each photomultiplier .",
    "the adc pedestals are measured every day and the gain inhomogenities are corrected off - line setting the peak of the minimum ionizing particle ( mips ) distribution to the same value for all photomultipliers according to the following procedure already used during the tests with cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "minimum ionizing particles have enough kinetic energy to penetrate in the detector and exit from the back side .",
    "the events corresponding to those particles ( mainly high - momentum pions ) that release their energy in a single cell are selected , in the off - line analysis , by imposing the presence of four adc signals in the inner part and the four corresponding adc signals in the outer part as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cellselection ] . as a preliminary step ,",
    "the correction for the dependence from the cell position is applied considering that the light attenuation in scintillators relates the read - out charge @xmath12 to the  true \" value @xmath13 according to the expression : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is given by the coordinates of the center of the cell , @xmath16 is the stack length and the two parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( representing , respectively , the light attenuation length and the reflectivity of the end surface of the scintillator bars ) are the constants that have been determined for each stack by the cosmic ray calibration described in ref.@xcite and stored in a database . after the position correction , the conversion factor charge - to - energy is evaluated , for each photomultiplier , in order to get the same mips peak position and to minimize the width of the overall deposited energy distribution .",
    "after the energy calibration and the equalization of the read - out of the 512 photomultipliers , the calorimeter energy response has been studied for different detected particles and the results are discussed in the following sections .",
    "protons are a powerful tool to check the linear response of individual stacks in a wide energy interval . the protons detected by clas and used in this analysis originated from multipion emission off a liquid hydrogen target in electron scattering .",
    "they have been selected by @xmath19.vs.momentum discrimination using informations from tof and dc .",
    "[ fig : evsp ] shows a typical distribution of the deposited energy in the lac as a function of the proton momentum .",
    "protons with momentum less than 0.6  release all their kinetic energy in the tof placed in front of the lac scintillators as well as in the lac front - housing and are not detected in lac .",
    "protons with momentum up to 1  are completely stopped by the calorimeter while higher - momentum protons release a fraction of their kinetic energy that approaches at very high momenta the asymptotic value of 106 @xmath20 .",
    "this value corresponds to the energy released by mips in the lac .",
    "the momentum dependence of the deposited energy and the width of the deposited energy distribution agree with the monte carlo simulations . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmavsp ] the momentum dependence of the width @xmath21 of the deposited energy distribution of the protons stopped in the calorimeter is reported .",
    "the dependence of @xmath21 from the deposited energy @xmath22 has been fitted with the expression @xmath23 with @xmath22 in @xmath24 .",
    "the parameter @xmath25 resulted very small while the value @xmath26 is larger than expected assuming the contribution only from the fluctuations in the light transmission and collection .",
    "actually different effects contribute to the widening the deposited energy distribution ; they include non uniformity in the effective scintillators and lead thicknesses due to different proton incident angle as well as non - uniformity in scintillator intercalibration .",
    "the contribution of each single effect can not be easily disentangled , therefore we compared the overall response of the lac modules with a realistic monte carlo simulation where we assumed 5 @xmath27 collected in average by each photomultiplier as already measured in cosmic ray tests @xcite , and a photomultiplier intercalibration non - uniformity equal to 5 @xmath28 .",
    "the continuous line in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmavsp ] represents the result of the simulation and the agreement is fairly good .",
    "to study the response to electromagnetic showers , the only possibility is the detection of the photons from the @xmath29 decay , because the flux of electrons scattered at large angles is too low and the @xmath30 contamination too high .",
    "the photons are identified selecting those events where the lac energy signal has no tof and dc signals in coincidence .",
    "the size of the electromagnetic shower is normally larger than the stack width and several stacks are involved in the detection . to reconstruct the photon energy first the two coordinates of the center of the shower",
    "are determined by weighting the coordinates of contiguous non - zero adcs with their read - out , then for each adc the read - out is corrected according to eq .",
    "[ eqn : lightatten ] .",
    "finally the photon energy is obtained multiplying the sum of the corrected adc read - outs by the sampling factor @xmath31 .",
    "this factor has been determind from monte carlo simulations .",
    "unfortunately the photon energy spectra shows a continuous yield and can not provide a direct test of the energy calibration .",
    "nevertheless photon energy resolution could strongly affect the reconstructed mass of @xmath32 and its investigation can provide an indirect check of this procedure as discussed in sec .",
    "[ section : pi0 ] .",
    "the time response of the detector can affects the detection and identification of neutral particles .",
    "photons originated from mesons decay can be disentangled from neutrons only using their different time - of - flight . to provide @xmath33",
    "discrimination good timing uniformity and resolution are required .",
    "the detector geometry allows a self - calibrating procedure . for each photomultiplier",
    "the relation between the particle time - of - flight @xmath34 and the corresponding tdc read - out @xmath35 already corrected for the time - walk according to ref .",
    "@xcite can be simply written as @xmath36 being @xmath37 the length of the trajectory from the target to the detector , @xmath38 the particle velocity , @xmath15 the distance between the impact point in the detector and the photomultiplier , @xmath39 the propagation velocity of the light in the scintillator , @xmath40 the intrinsic time delay of each electronic chain and @xmath41 the overall calibration constant equal for all photomultipliers . to provide the correct relationship between @xmath35 and @xmath19 ,",
    "the 512 different @xmath40 constants and @xmath41 need to be set properly .",
    "we first proceeded to the equalisation of the time response by setting the @xmath40 values using signal from mips . only events hitting a single cell",
    "were selected imposing the presence of four adc signals in the inner part and of the four corresponding adc signals in the outer part of the module .",
    "the adc signals were originated from pairs of photomultipliers coupled respectively to the right and to the left hand side of the same scintillator stack . by using the corresponding tdc readouts @xmath42 and @xmath43 together with eq .",
    "[ eqn : timing ] we evaluated for each stack the half - sum @xmath44 being @xmath16 the scintillator lenght , and the half - difference @xmath45 with the adopted selection each event is represented by eight numbers : the values @xmath46 and @xmath47 for the inner - short stacks , @xmath48 and @xmath49 for the inner - long stacks and similar values for the outer stacks .",
    "@xmath50 is simply the particle time - of - flight and consequently , for each single event , the four @xmath50 have to assume the same value , or equivalently , to satisfy the equation @xmath51 for any pair @xmath52 of the @xmath50 variables .    a similar relationship can be obtained for the four @xmath53 values as described in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltatequalization ] : for each stack the @xmath53 value has been set such that for events in the first cell the correspondig timing would be @xmath54 being @xmath15 the stack distance from the bottom - left angle of the module or equivalently the stack coordinate . in this way it is easy to verify that the events detected in any cell with coordinates @xmath55 are associated to the same @xmath53 value for both short and long read - out : @xmath56 with this condition , for each event the four @xmath53 have to assume the same value , or equivalently @xmath57 for any pair @xmath52 of the @xmath53 variables .",
    "therefore it can be easily proved that equalizing the timing response of the lac is equivalent to finding the values of the 512 @xmath40 that simultaneously set to zero the average value of the distributions @xmath58 and @xmath59 separately for the inner and the outer part of the detector , minimizing at the same time their widths . in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltat ] a typical result is reported .    to fix @xmath41",
    "we used the time - of - fligth of the photons originated from @xmath60 decay .",
    "we selected photons candidates in the reaction @xmath61 with missing mass equal to @xmath62 and a neutral particle detected in coincidence by the lac modules , then we evaluated from the time - of - flight the corresponding @xmath63 values being @xmath37 the length of the straight trajectory from the target center to the reconstructed impact point in the lac .",
    "we set the @xmath64 value imposing the mean values of the @xmath19 distribution equal to 1 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : betagamma ] the distribution of @xmath19 for detected photons shows a gaussian shape with @xmath65 .",
    "considering that the average distance from the target is 4 @xmath66 this value corresponds to a timing resolution @xmath67 well in agreement with that obtained in the preliminary tests with cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "the timing response is very good in the whole @xmath19 range as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tofvslac ] where the @xmath19 reconstructed with lac is compared to the @xmath19 from the tof for protons ( @xmath68 ) and @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "the data were taken using a 4.0 @xmath24 electron beam incident on a liquid h@xmath71 target .",
    "the reconstructed value of the @xmath29 mass provides a quantitative check of the lac energy equalisation and calibration .",
    "any energy miscalibration would in fact provide an incorrect mean value and a larger width for the reconstructed mass distribution . to verify that the energy calibration procedure discussed in sec .",
    "[ section : eresponse ] is correct , we selected the events from the reaction @xmath73 with one photon detected in the lac modules and one in the ec modules .",
    "the neutral hits in the calorimeters were identified by the absence of a matched track in drift chambers .",
    "photons detected by the lac generally belongs to low momentum pions that decay emitting the two photons with a large relative angle @xmath74 ; therefore candidate events corresponding to the decay @xmath75 were required to have a neutral hit in the lac and a second neutral hit in the other lac module or more favourably , in any ec module .",
    "the meson mass has been reconstructed from the photon energies @xmath76 , @xmath77 and the angle @xmath74 between the direction of the two photons according to @xmath78 the reconstructed @xmath79 , as shown in fig .",

    "@xmath82 is expected .",
    "neutrons as well as photons are identified by a neutral hit in the lac and the particle velocity is reconstructed from the time - of - flight .",
    "neutrons are separated from photons setting @xmath83 .    to study the lac response , the neutrons candidates were selected through the deuteron photo - disintegration @xmath84 imposing a cut in the missing mass distribution below the pion production threshold and the direction of the missing momentum oriented within the solid angle defined by the two lac modules .",
    "the data were taken using the 4.0 @xmath24 tagged photon beam incident on a liquid deuterium target . at this energy",

    "the results are reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : nmomres ] where the empty dots represent the experimental data and the full dots the simulation results : the agreement is fairly good in the whole investigated momentum range .    to evaluate the lac efficiency we simply counted the fraction of candidates that generated a neutral hit in the lac modules . in fig .",
    "[ fig : neff ] we report the results ( crosses ) together with the monte carlo results ( full dots ) as a function of @xmath86 : as for the momentum resolution , there is complete agreement in the whole investigated momentum range .",
