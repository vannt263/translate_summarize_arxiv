    "radiative transfer ( rt ) is the underlying physical phenomenon in many astrophysical problems and among the most difficult to deal with .",
    "the main difficulty arises from the non - local and in general non - linear coupling of the radiation field and the state of the gas .    in the problem of nlte line formation in a given atmospheric model ,",
    "the internal state of the gas depends , via radiative transitions , on the radiation field intensity , which in turn depends , via the rt process , on the state of the gas over a wide range of distant points .",
    "mathematically , the non - local coupling is performed by the simultaneous solution of the corresponding rt equation describing the dependence of the mean intensity on the source function @xmath0 $ ] by means of the so - called @xmath1 operator and the statistical equilibrium ( se ) equations defining the source function in terms of the mean intensity of the radiation field @xmath2 .    in the well - known two - level - atom line formation problem",
    "the non - local coupling is linear and the problem can be easily solved by using either direct or iterative methods . in a more general multilevel case ,",
    "rt problem is non - linear and , therefore , an iterative method is required .",
    "the most straightforward iterative procedure , the so  called @xmath3 iteration , solves radiative transfer and statistical equilibrium equations in turn .",
    "however , in most cases of interest ( in scattering dominated media of large optical thickness ) the rate of convergence of this simple procedure is infinitely slow .",
    "a broad class of ali ( approximate ( or accelerated ) lambda iteration ) methods , currently in use , is based on the use of certain physical or computational approximations of the @xmath3 operator within an iterative procedure .",
    "these methods usually employ some free parameter controlling the convergence and almost always need additional acceleration by some mathematical techniques ( ng acceleration , successive over - relaxation method , etc . ) to achieve high convergence rate ( @xcite @xcite ;  @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite developed the forth - and - back implicit lambda iteration ( fbili ) - a simple , accurate and extremely fast convergent method to solve nlte rt problems .",
    "fbili dramatically accelerates the convergence of the classical @xmath3 iteration while retaining its straightforwardness . in this paper",
    "the basic idea of the method is briefly explained and the applications to various rt problems are shown and discussed .",
    "in order to demonstrate the basis of the fbili method we shall consider the well - known case of the two - level atom line formation ( with complete redistribution and no overlapping continuum ) in a plane - parallel and static atmosphere . under these assumptions , the specific intensity of the radiation field @xmath4 is described by the rt equation of the form : @xmath5 \\ \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the mean optical depth , @xmath7 is the frequency displacement from the line center in doppler width units , @xmath8 is the cosine of the angle between the photon s direction and the outward normal and @xmath9 is the absorption - line profile , normalized to unity .",
    "the line source function ( se equation for a two - level atom ) has the following form : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the standard nlte parameter representing the branching ratio between the thermal ( lte ) contribution @xmath12 and the scattering term @xmath13 which accounts for the angle and frequency coupling of the specific intensities at the given depth point @xmath6 .",
    "the basic idea of the forth - and - back implicit @xmath3 iteration in the solution of the problem is as follows .",
    "first , as suggested by the existence of two separate boundary conditions , the fbili uses a separate description of the propagation of the in - going intensities of the radiation field @xmath14 with initial conditions at the surface ( @xmath15 ) and of the out - going intensities @xmath16 with initial conditions at the bottom of the atmosphere ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "second , although the values of the radiation field are unknown , its propagation can be easily represented by using the integral form of the rt equation and assuming polynomial ( e.g. piecewise quadratic ) representation of the source function between two successive depth points .",
    "thus , for each depth point one can write linear relations for the specific intensities as functions of the unknown values of the source function and of its derivative",
    ". following the idea of iteration factors , it is the iterative computation of the coefficients of these _ implicit _ relations ( implicit , as the source function is a priori unknown ) , rather than that of the unknown functions themselves , which greatly accelerates the convergence of the direct iterative scheme .    in the first part of each iteration ( forward process ) , proceeding from the upper boundary condition , using the integral form of the rt equation for the in - going intensities for each layer ( @xmath18 ) : @xmath19 where @xmath20 , and assuming parabolic behavior for the source function @xmath21 , one can write the linear _ local implicit _ relation @xmath22 s(\\tau _ l ) + c^-_{x\\mu } s^{\\prime } ( \\tau _ l)\\ , \\ ] ] representing the values of the in - going intensities @xmath23 at a given optical depth point @xmath24 in terms of yet unknown values of the source function @xmath25 and of its derivative @xmath26 . here ,",
    "@xmath27 is computed with the old ( known from the previous iteration ) source function @xmath28 , whereas @xmath29 and @xmath30 depend only on the known optical distance @xmath31 . by integrating ( 5 ) over all frequencies and directions",
    "we obtain the linear relation @xmath32 representing _ implicitly _ the value of the in - going mean intensity .",
    "thus , in the forward process , we differ from the classical @xmath3 iteration that re - calculates @xmath33 from the old ( known ) source function @xmath34 , in using the old source function to compute , at each optical depth point @xmath35 , the coefficients @xmath36 and @xmath37 of the linear relation ( 6 ) .",
    "the coefficients are stored for further use in the backward process of computation of the new values of @xmath38 .",
    "let us note here that the ratio in eq .",
    "( 5 ) of the non - local part of the in - going intensity @xmath39 to the current source function @xmath40 is actually the iteration factor . since it is the only information that is carried from the previous iteration step , an extremely fast convergence is to be expected .",
    "the final aim is to derive , at each optical depth point @xmath24 , an _ implicit _ linear relation between the full mean intensity and the source function @xmath41 that , together with equation ( 2 ) , leads to the new source function . to obtain this ,",
    "we need the coefficients of the corresponding relation for the out - going mean intensity .    in the backward process",
    "we proceed from the bottom where @xmath42 , i.e. @xmath43 is known or more precisely , the coefficients of the _ implicit _ relation for the out - going specific intensities and , therefore , for the out - going mean intensity @xmath44 are known at @xmath17 . eliminating @xmath45 from eq .",
    "( 6 ) ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) we obtain the linear implicit relation ( 7 ) , which together with se equation ( 2 ) leads to the new value of @xmath46 .",
    "the new values of @xmath47 , @xmath48 and , hence , @xmath49 are then used to compute the coefficients of the linear relation ( 8) in the next upper layer . together with the coefficients of eq .",
    "( 6 ) ( stored in the forward process ) , we obtain the coefficients @xmath50 and @xmath51 of eq . ( 7 ) .",
    "the computation of @xmath50 and @xmath51 and the solution of eq .",
    "( 7 ) together with se equation ( 2 ) to get a new source function @xmath25 are performed during the backward process layer by layer to the surface .",
    "the process is iterated to the convergence .",
    "the accuracy and efficiency of the fbili method have been checked in several rt problems . here , we list some of the applications .",
    "the method was first developed for the two - level - atom line formation ( with complete redistribution and no overlapping continuum ) in a plane - parallel constant property medium ( for details see @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "this case represents an ideal test for checking the numerical accuracy and stability of a new method .",
    "namely , under such conditions the features of the solution depend only on the nlte parameter @xmath11 that is usually very small , so that the numerical errors can easily blur the solution .    thus , in order to test the stability of the method we solved the two - level atom problem with @xmath52 .",
    "the results are given in fig .",
    "they are compared with the exact discrete - ordinate solution @xcite , obtained by using the same discretization in optical depth ( 10 points per decade ) .",
    "the asymptotic value of the maximum relative error of the order of 0.3@xmath53 is reached already within 9 - 14 iterations .",
    "namely , only nine iterations are sufficient for the maximum relative correction between two successive iterations ( for all depth points ) to be less than @xmath54 and 14 iterations for @xmath55 .",
    "hence , we see that a negligible additional effort ( of the iterative computation of the coefficients of the _ implicit _ relations , instead of the mean intensities themselves ) with respect to the classical @xmath3 iteration results in an extremely fast convergence ( about 10 fbili iterations compared to about @xmath56 classical @xmath3 iterations , while one fbili iteration takes only about 10@xmath53 more cpu time than a classical @xmath3 iteration ) .    in the literature",
    "the performances of various methods are usually given for @xmath57 .",
    "thus , for this case , in fig .",
    "2 the convergence properties of the fbili method are compared with those of the ali methods that use diagonal and 3-diagonal approximate @xmath58 operators @xcite .",
    "excellent convergence properties of the fbili are evident . using fbili yields convergence that is comparable to or even faster ( for @xmath59 ) than the 3-diagonal operator with ng acceleration !",
    "the fbili method was applied to the case of the two - level atom line formation problem in which partial redistribution is taken into account in the paper by @xcite .",
    "the results reproduced the well - known ones by @xcite .",
    "for the cases @xmath60 and @xmath61 , 13 and 15 iterations , respectively , are enough to fulfill the criterion @xmath55 for all the frequencies and all optical depths .",
    "the procedure for multilevel problem is the same as in the two - level - atom case .",
    "starting with the known set of level populations , we repeat the entire forward process for each radiative transition @xmath62 . in the backward process ,",
    "layer by layer , we compute the coefficients of the linear relation ( 7 ) for all the transitions , and replacing them in the se equations we solve the latter for the new set of level populations .",
    "the test is performed by solving the same problem ( three - level hydrogen atom line formation in an isothermal atmosphere ) as in @xcite .",
    "the solution with a maximum relative error below 3@xmath53 is obtained in only nine iterations with the convergence criterion @xmath63 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the generalization of the fbili method to spherical geometry is performed by @xcite .",
    "monochromatic scattering problem in a spherical atmosphere is solved and the results are compared with those given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the relative difference of the solutions is about 1@xmath53 .",
    "the solution is obtained already in the second iteration , whereas three iterations are required for the maximum relative correction to be less than 1@xmath53 .      in order to test the feasibility of the method when applied to the line formation in spherically symmetric media , the test problem of the line transfer with background absorption , proposed by @xcite and @xcite , is solved .",
    "the solution is obtained in 15 iterations with an error less than 2@xmath53 .",
    "forth - and - back implicit lambda iteration method is a simple , stable and extremely fast convergent iterative method developed for the exact solution of nlte rt problems .",
    "a negligible additional computational effort with respect to the classical @xmath3 iteration results in an extremely fast convergence . no additional acceleration is needed .",
    "the method is easy to apply . no matrix formalism is required so that the memory storage grows linearly with dimension of the problem .",
    "due to its great simplicity and considerable savings in computational time and memory storage fbili seems to be a far - reaching tool to deal with more complex problems ( multidimensional rt , rt in moving media , or when rt has to be coupled with other physical phenomena ) .",
