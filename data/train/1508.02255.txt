    "in addition , scatterers with a high degree of symmetry , such as spheres , spheroids and cylinders , may support morphology - dependent resonances , which are related to constructive interferences confined inside the particle by almost total internal reflections  @xcite .",
    "recently , a great deal of attention has been devoted to fano resonances in plasmonic nanostrutures due to its sensitivity to both geometry and local environment changes  @xcite .",
    "the interference between a broad bright resonance and a narrow dark resonance modes , supported by plasmonic nanostrutures , gives rise to the fano resonance , which has a characteristic , asymmetric lineshape with a narrow bandwidth  @xcite . by properly choosing the materials and/or the system design , it is possible to generate _",
    "e.g. _ multiple fano , comblike scattering resonances in plasmonic nanoparticles  @xcite .",
    "the design of these fano - comb nanoparticles may enable several applications at different spectral ranges , such as improving the resolution in comb - spectroscopy techniques  @xcite , and optical tagging  @xcite .",
    "one possible way to achieve comblike resonances in em scattering is to consider multilayered core - shell nanoparticles  @xcite .",
    "the main idea is to combine localized plasmon resonances and the scattering cancellation technique for a single core - shell scatterer  @xcite , whose core is dielectric and the coating is composed of multilayered semiconductor materials with a gradient of doping level .",
    "an alternative approach to obtain fano - comb resonances is to consider nonconcentric , single - layered cylindrical nanostructures  @xcite , whose fabrication is considerably simpler than multilayered nanoparticles .    in the present paper ,",
    "we propose an alternative approach , based on magnetic materials , for generating comblike scattering response in concentric , single - layered core - shell nanoparticles , which can exhibit fano resonances  @xcite . instead of inducing fano - comb resonances by the geometrical symmetry breaking in single - layered core - shell nanostructures  @xcite , we suggest the use of high permeability covers  @xcite in center - symmetric scatterers .",
    "indeed , in the long - wavelength limit , the presence of a ferromagnetic layer breaks the isotropy of the rayleigh scattering , and allow us to obtain multiple fano , comblike scattering resonances composed of both electric and magnetic dipole resonances in the extinction cross - sections  @xcite .",
    "these fano - like resonances , known as `` unconventional '' fano resonances  @xcite , are different from the conventional fano ones  @xcite , since they are polarization - independent and arise from the interference between em modes with the same multipole moment .",
    "we explore these properties to derive analytical conditions for the occurrence of comblike resonances in coated spheres composed of a dielectric core and a high magnetic permeability shell . as the condition for the occurrence of multiple fano resonances depends explicitly on the value of the magnetic permeability of the shell",
    ", we argue that both the position and profile of the comblike resonances could be externally tuned .",
    "this tuning could be achieved by exploiting _",
