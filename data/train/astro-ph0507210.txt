    "a microlensing event occurs when a luminous object is temporarily magnified by a massive body , such as a star or dark matter object , passing close to the line of sight and acting as a gravitational lens .",
    "@xcite advocated searching for microlensing events towards the large magellanic cloud in order to detect dark matter in the galactic halo . soon",
    "three separate collaborations were conducting systematic searches : ogle @xcite , eros @xcite , and macho @xcite , between them observing the large and small magellanic clouds and the galactic bulge .",
    "other groups such as moa ( e.g. @xcite ) have since joined the search , and thousands of microlensing events have now been detected ( e.g. , @xcite ) , almost all towards the bulge .",
    "a much smaller number of microlensing candidates have also been identified toward the large magellanic cloud ( e.g. , @xcite ) and m31 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one of the main aims of all these observations is to accurately measure the optical depth , @xmath5  the probability of seeing a microlensing event at any given instant  which can provide much information about the structure and mass distribution of the galaxy and its halo .    since the first estimates of @xmath5 by @xcite and @xcite , predictions based on increasingly refined models have consistently and significantly disagreed with measurements based on increasingly large sets of observational data .",
    "however , there are now signs of convergence . @xcite",
    "hereafter hg03  used star counts from the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) to normalise their galactic model , predicting @xmath6 towards baade s window ( bw ) , based on lensing of red clump giants ( rcgs ) .",
    "they noted reasonable agreement with two recent measurements towards the bulge , also based on rcgs , of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , from the macho @xcite and eros @xcite collaborations , respectively .",
    "the numbers in parentheses are from table 2 of @xcite , who enabled a better comparison between all bulge optical depth measurements to be made by adjusting the values for their offset from bw . now from 7 years of macho survey data , @xcite report @xmath9 at @xmath10 , which is in excellent agreement with recent theoretical predictions , including the @xcite result .",
    "most recently , from the ogle - ii survey @xcite find @xmath11 at @xmath12 , which is also consistent with the latest macho survey value .",
    "in this paper we generate monte carlo simulations of the galaxy based on hg03 .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . ",
    "[ sec : model ] describes the model and theory , and  [ sec : results ] presents our results : in  [ sec : opdepth res ] we reproduce the hg03 @xmath13 , and then compare our predicted @xmath5 with the recent macho and ogle results in various directions . ",
    "[ sec : maps ] presents maps of optical depth and average event time - scale ( duration ) .",
    "these maps can be compared with observations in any direction . in  [ sec : tscales ] we predict the event rate as a function of time - scale and compare this to the distribution observed by ogle . in  [ sec : frac ] we show how at both long and short times the time - scale distribution is directly related to the lens mass function .",
    "we summarise our results in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "@xcite compared various hypothetical mass density models of the bulge to the infrared light density profile seen by the cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) satellite .",
    "we use the g2 ( barred ) model from their table 1 , with @xmath14 = 5 kpc .",
    "the bar is inclined by @xmath15 to the galactic centre line of sight , and the distance to the galactic centre is set at 8 kpc .",
    "@xcite used 8.5 kpc , so we adjust their model parameters accordingly .",
    "the model is then normalised by _ hst _ star counts ( see the end of  [ sec : populations ] ) .",
    "this independent constraint can be used to normalise any bulge model .    for the disc",
    ", we use the local disc density model of @xcite , as extended to the whole disc by hg03 . as the disc model",
    "is relatively secure ( hg03 ) , it will contribute only small uncertainties to predictions of the optical depth , so it is not renormalised as for the bulge model .",
    "the optical depths reported by @xcite are based on lensing of rcgs in the bulge , and hg03 assume only bulge rcg sources in their model .",
    "@xcite observed lensing of red giants and red super giants as well as rcgs .",
    "we assume that these different types of stars follow the same bar density distribution and are bright enough to be seen throughout the bar , which corresponds to the case with @xmath16 in the following eq .",
    "( [ eq : opdepth ] ) .",
    "our lens mass function is generated as in hg03 .",
    "their unnormalised bulge mass function assumes initial star formation according to @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 for @xmath20 , and @xmath21 for @xmath22 , consistent with observations by @xcite .",
    "however hg03 extended this beyond the latter s lower limit of @xmath23 to a brown dwarf cut - off of @xmath24 .",
    "we assume objects with masses 0.030.08 @xmath25 and 0.081 @xmath25 become brown dwarfs ( bd ) and main - sequence stars ( ms ) respectively , 18 @xmath25 stars evolve into 0.6 @xmath25 white dwarfs ( wd ) , 840 @xmath25 stars become 1.35 @xmath25 neutron stars ( ns ) , and anything more massive forms a 5 @xmath25 black hole ( bh ) .    for ms stars we use the mass - luminosity relation of @xcite , and take all other lenses to be dark",
    ". the model is then normalised by comparing extinction - adjusted ms counts to _ hst _ star counts @xcite as described in hg03 .",
    "the same mass function and luminosity relation are also used for the disc",
    ". strictly they should be independently estimated , but any uncertainties are small compared to others involved as we find disc stars account for only @xmath26 per cent of the total number of stars in bw .      to calculate the event rate , we must also specify the velocities of the lenses , sources and observer . the observer velocity @xmath27 is assumed to follow the galactic rotation , so the two velocity components in @xmath0 and @xmath1 are given by @xmath28 the lens and source velocities in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 directions are given by @xmath29 where the rotation velocity @xmath30 and the random velocity @xmath31 are from @xcite : for the disc @xmath32 , and for the bar @xmath30 is given by projecting @xmath33 across the line of sight according to @xmath34 where @xmath35 , and the coordinates @xmath36 have their origin at the galactic centre , with the @xmath37 and @xmath38 axes pointing towards the earth and the north galactic pole respectively .",
    "the random velocity components @xmath39 and @xmath40 are assumed to have gaussian distributions .",
    "for the disc @xmath41 , and for the bar we use @xmath42 = ( 110 , 82.5 , 66.3)@xmath43 as found by @xcite using the tensor virial theorem ( see also @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "these values should be altered slightly as hg03 used a different normalisation .",
    "this may affect our results slightly , but it is re - assuring that our results based on such a simple kinematic model appear to agree with the data quite well ( see  [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "@xmath5 in any given direction is an average over the optical depths of all the source stars in that direction .",
    "the optical depth to a particular star is defined as the probability that it is within the einstein radius ( see below ) of any foreground lenses .",
    "hence more distant stars , although fainter and less likely to be detected , have higher optical depths @xcite .",
    "hg03 accounted for this with the term @xmath44 in the calculation of observed optical depth : @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the distances to the source and deflector ( lens ) , and @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the source number density and lens mass density .",
    "rcgs and other bright stars in the bulge can be identified independently of their distance , so @xmath50 .",
    "( [ eq : opdepth ] ) was originally presented ( in a slightly different form ) by @xcite , who also derived an expression for the lensing event rate @xmath51 .",
    "we give this here in terms of @xmath44 , and account for variation in lens mass by bringing the term @xmath52 inside the integral : @xmath53^{1/2 } \\over \\int_0^\\infty \\dds \\ds^{2-\\gamma }",

    "( [ eq : v_lb ] ) .",
    "the time - scale of an event @xmath61 is defined as the time taken for a source to cross the einstein radius of the lens @xmath62 @xcite : @xmath63",
    "hg03 calculated @xmath64 towards bw for bulge , disc , and all lenses respectively .",
    "our equivalent values are ( 1.06 , 0.65 , 1.71 ) @xmath65 .",
    "hg03 noted that the value of @xmath44 makes little difference to @xmath5 for disc lenses , but for bulge lenses @xmath5 becomes @xmath66 when @xmath67 .",
    "we find @xmath68 in this case .",
    "our results for bulge lenses differ by 78 per cent from hg03 s due to a slight difference in implementation of the bulge model normalisation .",
    "we find that allowing ms disc lenses to also act as sources themselves makes a negligible difference to the total value of @xmath5 .",
    "the macho measurement @xcite of @xmath9 at @xmath10 , was obtained from a sub - sample of their observed fields , the ` central galactic region ' ( cgr ) , which covers 4.5 deg@xmath69 and contains 42 of the 62 rcg microlensing events seen .",
    "the coordinates @xmath70 are a weighted average position of these fields ; the unweighted average is @xmath71 .",
    "optical depths were also given for a region ` cgr+3 ' that contains 3 additional fields , and for all 62 events . in table [ tab : opdepths_macho ] we compare our expected values to each of these results , and to @xmath5 reported for each of the individual cgr fields .",
    "ogle s measurement @xcite of @xmath72 at @xmath73 made use of 32 rcg events , in 20 of their 49 fields , where @xmath73 is the weighted average field position .",
    "@xmath5 was also given for each field ; we compare our values to all of these results in table [ tab : opdepths_ogle ] .",
    "note that any significant disagreement occurs only in individual fields , and that in only 1 of the 6 fields ( macho and ogle ) with @xmath74 events ( ogle # 30 ) does our value lie far outside the stated @xmath75 uncertainty .",
    "table [ tab : frac_opdepth ] shows the percentage contributions to the total optical depth and event rate from the different types of lenses .",
    "the disc lenses contribute about 37 per cent of the optical depth and a slightly smaller fraction ( 31 per cent ) of the event rate .",
    "we see that 62 per cent of all events have luminous ( ms ) lenses , the other 38 per cent are dark ( bd , wd , ns and bh ) .",
    "the nss and bhs contribute about 9 per cent of the optical depth but only 4 per cent of the event rate .",
    "this is because the events caused by stellar remnants on average have longer time - scales , and thus they occur less frequently .",

    "in this paper , we have used a simple galaxy model normalised by star counts @xcite to predict the microlensing optical depth . combined with simple kinematic models , we also predict maps and distributions of the time - scale distributions . we have shown that the fraction of long and short events contributed by a lens of mass @xmath2 is weighted by @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively .",
    "if the tails of this distribution can be accurately determined from observations , we have a direct probe of the lens mass function .",
    "it is remarkable that this emprically - normalised model based on the cobe g2 model @xcite shows good agreement with data recently published by the macho and ogle collaborations ( @xcite and @xcite ) for the optical depth in various galactic fields , and its trends with @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",

    "however , the numbers of microlensing events used ( 42 and 32 ) in the recent macho and ogle analyses are still small , so the test on the models is not yet stringent .",

    "as described in  [ sec : frac ] , the microlensing event rate shows asymptotic behaviour at both long and short time - scales .",
    "we show here that this is directly related to the lens mass function , specifically , the fractional contributions are weighted by @xmath3 and @xmath4 , at very long and short time - scales respectively .",
    "the event rate is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : freq ] ) .",
    "however , as the mass dependence of the asympototic behaviour is the same for sources at different distances , we shall ignore the source distance dependences here .",
    "therefore for a source at distance @xmath46 and a population of lenses each with identical velocity @xmath54 and mass @xmath2 , the event rate is given by @xmath80 where @xmath49 is the lens mass density at @xmath47 .",
    "in reality , @xmath54 and @xmath2 both vary .",
    "the velocity probability distribution , @xmath81 , can usually be approximated by a two - dimensional maxwellian distribution @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the velocity dispersion . for constant @xmath2 , the factor @xmath49 in eq .",
    "( [ dfreq1 ] ) is simply the total mass density .",
    "when @xmath2 varies , the event rate depends on the lens mass function , i.e. on how the total mass is partitioned into lenses of different masses .",
    "we assume that this is the same everywhere .",
    "the mass density for lenses with @xmath84 can be written as a product of @xmath85 , where @xmath86 indicates the distance dependence and @xmath87 is the number density of lenses between @xmath84 .",
    "integrating over the mass and velocity distributions and using the fact that @xmath88 , we obtain @xmath89 where @xmath90 .",
    "we can now rewrite the time - scale equation ( eq . [ eq : te ] ) @xmath91 the typical transverse velocity is @xmath92 , and this defines a characteristic time - scale as @xmath93 the short and long tails satisfy @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively .      as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ te3 ] ) , the long time - scale events occur when the lens and source both move approximately parallel to each other and perpendicular to the line of sight . in this case , the transverse velocity is close to zero ( @xmath96 ) and the time - scale becomes long .    for events with time - scales",
    "longer than @xmath97 , the transverse velocity must satisfy @xmath98 the exponential factor @xmath99 approaches unity , and so we have @xmath100 therefore , for long time - scale events , the event rate follows a power - law as a function of time - scale , with a normalisation that depends on the mass function , @xmath101 , as also derived by @xcite .",
    "re - expressing equation ( [ te2 ] ) in terms of @xmath102 , we have @xmath103 very short events occur when the lens is very close to either the source or the observer , i.e. , when @xmath104 or @xmath105 .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour is the same for @xmath106 and @xmath107 , so we concentrate here on the case when @xmath106 , @xmath108 .",
    "so for events shorter than a given time - scale @xmath109 , we must have @xmath110 equation ( [ dfreq2 ] ) can then be re - written in terms of @xmath37 : @xmath111^{1/2}\\ , \\f(\\dd)\\ , \\ddd                                                                                                \\int n(m ) m^{1/2}\\ , \\dm \\int v\\ , \\p(v)\\ , \\dv .",
