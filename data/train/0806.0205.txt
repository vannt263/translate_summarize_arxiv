    "there is an analogy between the current status of particle physics and molecular biology , in each of which there is a theoretical framework to explain the particle world or living world ( the standard model for the former while the central dogma and gene regulation for the latter ) , but we do not know the dynamical mechanisms that underlie these theoretical frameworks .",
    "it is generally believed that the genetic information is stored in dna sequences .",
    "this often results in a misapprehension that all the information about a species is stored in the sequences of its genome .",
    "actually , only a part of the information of life is stored in the sequences , from which we may infer the structures and functions of macromolecules .",
    "but there is still other information concerns the underlying mechanism of the evolution of life , which can not be acquired by analyzing the sequences .",
    "for example , the mechanism that determines the protein length distribution differs from the mechanism that determines in the protein sequences , which requires new explanation other than the current theoretical framework .",
    "the protein length distribution is an intrinsic properties of a species that concerns the underlying mechanism of molecular evolution .",
    "but the nature of the protein length distribution is still unknown .",
    "someone considered it as a result of stochastic process , while others noticed the order in the length distributions @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "we found that much information of the evolution of life is stored in the fluctuations of protein length distributions .",
    "the genome size of a species , even its coding dna size and non - coding dna size can be calculated by the protein length distribution of this species .",
    "we also found that the three domains of life ( bacteria , archaea , and eucarya ) can be classified based on the correlations or quasi - periodicity of protein length distributions ; furthermore , we can obtain the phylogeny of the three domains @xcite .",
    "these results shows that the protein length distributions are not random , the fluctuations in the distribution are intrinsic properties and can be taken as the fingerprint of a certain species .",
    "we propose a linguistic model to explain the generation of protein sequences and consequently try to explain the nature of protein length distributions .",
    "the model indicates that the complexity of the grammars that generate protein sequences is related to the biological complexity of the species .",
    "the protein length distributions might be taken as clues to discover the underlying mechanism of molecular evolution .",
    "the evolution of genome size is one of the central problems in the study of molecular evolution @xcite@xcite .",
    "we can write down the experimental formulae of genome size and the ratio of non - coding dna to coding dna based on the protein length distributions , which may help us understand the mechanism of genome size evolution .    the protein length distribution of a species @xmath0 can be denoted by a vector @xmath1 where there are @xmath2 proteins in its entire proteome whose lengths are @xmath3 amino acids ( a.a . ) .",
    "our data of the protein length distributions are obtained from the data of @xmath4 complete proteomes ( @xmath5 bacteria , @xmath6 archaea , @xmath7 eukaryotes and @xmath8 viruses ) in the database predictions for entire proteomes ( pep ) @xcite .",
    "the total protein length distribution of all the species in pep is @xmath9 , from which we found that there are few proteins longer than @xmath10 a.a . in the complete proteomes .",
    "we can neglect them and set @xmath11 as the cutoff of protein length in our calculations .",
    "hence the vectors @xmath12 can be reduced to @xmath11-dimensional vectors to represent the protein length distributions .",
    "[ fig1 ]    a peak at protein length @xmath13 in the fluctuations of protein length distribution of species @xmath0 can be denoted by @xmath14 , which is required to be greater than both @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the number of peaks in the fluctuations of protein length distribution of species @xmath0 can be denoted by @xmath17 .",
    "we found that there is an exponential relationship between genome size @xmath18 and number of peaks @xmath17 ( fig 1a ) @xmath19 where @xmath20 base pairs ( bp ) and @xmath21 .",
    "we had also obtained another formula to calculate the genome size @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the non - coding dna content in the complete genome of species @xmath0 and the correlation polar angle is defined by @xmath24 . in terms of the above two experimental formulae of genome zise , we obtained a formula to calculate the non - coding dna content : @xmath25 where both @xmath26 and @xmath27 depend only on protein length distributions .",
    "there are @xmath28 species in pep whose non - coding dna contents are known according to to ref .",
    "the prediction of the non - coding dna contents agrees with the experimental observations ( fig 1b ) .",
    "thus , we found that the genomic properties can be predicted based only on the protein length distributions .",
    "the information of genome size @xmath18 , non - coding dna size @xmath29 and coding dna size @xmath30 are stored in the fluctuations of protein length distribution of species @xmath0 .",
    "more peaks in the fluctuations indicates lager genome size .",
    "and the number of peaks in the fluctuations also relates to the non - coding dna content .",
    "the protein length distribution concerns only the coding dna , but we can deduce the non - coding dna size by such a distribution .",
    "this shows that there must be a universal mechanism to adjust the ratio of coding dna and non - coding dna in each species .    in some studies ,",
    "the protein length are considered as random variable of a stochastic process .",
    "if so , there should not be close relationship between the number of peaks @xmath17 and the genome size @xmath18 ; and the outline of the protein length distribution would be more smooth when the genome size increases .",
    "our results show that the protein length is not a random variable of stochastic process and the fluctuations are intrinsic properties .",
    "the number of peaks of the fluctuations in the protein length distribution @xmath17 is an intrinsic property of a species @xmath0 .",
    "we also found that the correlation between @xmath17 and @xmath18 is closer than the correlation between @xmath17 and @xmath31 ( fig 1b and fig 2c ) .",
    "it is suggested that the biological complexity is related to the non - coding dna content , and the biological complexity is also related to the genome size for prokaryotes @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the number of peaks @xmath17 can be interpreted as the complexity of structures of protein length distribution .",
    "the linguistics plays significant roles in the organization of protein or dna sequences @xcite@xcite .",
    "we proposed a linguistic mechanism to account for the generation of protein sequences @xcite .",
    "the bell - shaped outline and the fluctuations of the protein length distribution can be simulated by a linguistic model .",
    "the number of peaks of the fluctuations in the protein length distribution is determined by the complexity of grammars .",
    "the correlation between @xmath17 and @xmath18 indicates a relationship between the complexity of the structure of protein length distribution and the biological complexity of that species , both of which may result from the complexity of grammars in the sequences .",
    "[ fig1 ]    molecular sequence analysis provides a more precise and profound method in classification of life than classical taxonomy .",
    "based upon rrna sequence comparisons , life on this planet can be divided into three domains : the bacteria , the archaea , and the eucarya @xcite .",
    "the differences that separate the three domains are of a more profound nature than the differences that separate classical five kingdoms ( monera , protista , fungi , plantae , animalia ) . the correlations and quasi - periodicity in the protein length distributions may originate in a general underlying mechanism of generation of protein sequences @xcite @xcite . according to the theory of multivariation data analysis",
    ", we can classify life in the three domains based only on the protein length distributions .",
    "the correlation coefficient of protein length distributions between species @xmath0 and @xmath32 is defined by @xmath33 where @xmath34 . and",
    "the average correlation coefficient of species @xmath0 can be defined by @xmath35 we can also define the minkowski distance between species @xmath0 and @xmath32 as @xmath36 where we chose the parameter @xmath37 in the calculation . and the average minkowski distance of species @xmath0 can be defined by @xmath38 the average correlation coefficient @xmath39 and the average minkowski distance @xmath40 represent the evolutionary relationship between species @xmath0 and all the other species .",
    "the more the average correlation coefficient is ( or inversely the less the average minkowski distance is ) , the closer the evolutionary relationship is",
    ".    we can classify life by clustering analysis based only on the protein length distributions . in the @xmath41 plane",
    ", we found that the species in the three domains cluster together respectively ( fig 2a ) .",
    "the similar results can also be obtained by other methods .",
    "the average protein length in the proteome of species @xmath0 can be calculated by protein length distribution : @xmath42 according to the distributions of species in the plots of @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , we found that the species in the three domains also cluster together in the corresponding plots respectively .",
    "[ fig1 ]    we can also classify life according to the quasi - periodicity of protein length distributions .",
    "there are underlying orders in the organization of protein sequences , so we can observe the quasi - periodic structures in the protein length distributions . according to fourier analysis , we can also observe the clustering of species for different domains .",
    "the abstract discrete fourier transformation of the protein length distribution @xmath12 is : @xmath46 the frequency of the highest peak in the fluctuations of the spectrum @xmath47 can be denoted by @xmath48 .",
    "the maximum frequency for the top @xmath49 highest peaks in the fluctuations of the spectrum @xmath47 can be denoted by @xmath50 .",
    "we found that there is an interesting relationship between the highest peak frequency @xmath48 and the average protein length @xmath51 of species ( fig . 3 in ref .",
    "the distribution of species in @xmath52 plane shows a regular pattern : the species in the three domains gathered in three rainbow - like arches respectively .",
    "this pattern strongly indicates the intrinsic correlation among the protein length distributions , which can not achieve if the protein length distributions are stochastic .",
    "the periodicity of the protein length distributions can be inferred by the correlations between @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the regular distribution of species in fig .",
    "2d indicates the correlation between the short period @xmath55 and the long period @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , the quasi - periodic structures of the spectra indicate the correlations between long proteins and short proteins in a proteome .",
    "the total spectra for three domains bacteria , archaea and eucarya are @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 respectively .",
    "so the average spectra for the three domains are defined as follows respectively : @xmath60 where @xmath61 and we chose @xmath62 and @xmath63 as the ranges for averaging in calculations .",
    "we found that the outlines of @xmath64 and @xmath65 are similar , both of which have convex bottoms ( fig 3a , b ) , but they are dissimilar with the outline of @xmath66 , which has a concave bottom ( fig 3c ) . according to the phylogeny of the three domains , the relationship between archaea and eucarya is more closer than the relationship between archaea and bacteria .",
    "so the outlines of the average spectra of the three domains reveal the phylogeny of the three domains .",
    "we can conclude that much evolutionary information is stored in the protein length distributions , according to which we can calculate the genome size and non - coding dna content .",
    "the mechanism that determines the protein length distribution concerns not only coding dna but also non - coding dna .",
    "so we demonstrated the intrinsic relationship between coding dna size and non - coding dna size .",
    "new methods are proposed to classify life into three domains based only on the protein length distributions .",
