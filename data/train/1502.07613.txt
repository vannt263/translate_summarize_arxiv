    "the ising model in dimension @xmath2 , being strictly larger than the upper critical dimension @xmath3 of the model , has been studied by many authors , and has been the focus of a long running debate regarding its finite size scaling behaviour .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a discussion of that topic .",
    "however , even regarding the infinite size limit of the model there are still interesting open questions . for @xmath4",
    "it is rigorously known that on the @xmath5-dimensional hypercubic lattice the critical exponents of model takes their mean field values .",
    "this was first proven in @xcite and more recently the newly developed rigorous lace expansion for the ising model @xcite made it possible to give a unified proof of these results by a single method @xcite . for the specific heat the critical exponent @xmath6 and",
    "the results of @xcite also show a stronger result , namely that the specific heat is bounded at the critical point",
    ". however , the values of the critical exponents are not the only properties which are characteristic for the phase transition in the mean field version of the model , there is also a discontinuity in the value of the specific heat at the critical point .",
    "in fact , historically this discontinuity was once noted as one of the first signs showing that mean field theory does not give a correct description of phase transitions in dimension 2 and 3 .",
    "hence it is natural to ask if there is a similar discontinuity in the specific heat for the ising model above the upper critical dimension .",
    "this question is also natural from another point of view . one way of realizing the mean field version of the ising model is to view it as the thermodynamic limit of the ising model on finite complete graphs .",
    "the model on complete graphs has been studied rigorously in great detail by mathematicians , both in the usual ising form and the equivalent fortuin - kateleyn random cluster representation , @xcite .",
    "numerically it has been observed @xcite that for @xmath2 the model on finite lattices with periodic boundary conditions displays the same scaling behaviour inside the critical scaling window as the ising model on a complete graph .",
    "hence it is also natural to ask if the behaviour of the thermodynamic limit of the model on the complete graph and the hypercubic lattice will also show the same type of behaviour at the critical point , in particular if both have a discontinuous specific heat and how large the jump at that discontinuity is .    in order to study this question we have done monte carlo simulation of the ising model on hypercubic lattices with periodic boundary conditions , with the main effort for @xmath2 but with some data for @xmath7 as well . using these data",
    "we first give improved estimates for the critical temperatures in these dimensions .",
    "next we find that there is a jump in the specific heat and give estimates for the left and right hand limits of the specific heat at the critical temperature @xmath0 .",
    "we also estimate the singular critical exponents , describing how the specific heat approaches the limit values . as mentioned in @xcite the singular exponents , unlike the critical ones ,",
    "are not expected to necessarily have the same value on the low and high - temperature sides of the critical point , and we find that their values are quite distinct . finally we also note that as @xmath5 increases the behaviour at the critical points seems to be approaching that of the mean field limit , as expected .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "after some definitions we first give a derivation of the specific heat for the complete graphs , and use it to give a description of the specific heat for the mean field limit which is more detailed than the usual one .",
    "next we present our numerical data for @xmath2 , first for the critical temperature @xmath0 and then for the specific heat near @xmath0 .",
    "after that we give a brief description of the corresponding results for @xmath7 , and finally we give some discussion of the observed results .",
    "for a given graph @xmath8 on @xmath9 vertices the hamiltonian with interactions of unit strength along the edges is @xmath10 where the sum is taken over the edges @xmath11 .",
    "as usual the coupling @xmath12 is the dimensionless inverse temperature and we denote the thermal equilibrium mean by @xmath13 .",
    "the we call the critical coupling @xmath0 , and denote its normalised form by @xmath14 and the rescaled version @xmath15 . as usual",
    "the magnetisation is @xmath16 ( summing over the vertices @xmath17 ) and the energy is @xmath18 ( summing over the edges @xmath11 ) .",
    "we let @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the specific heat is defined as @xmath22    when the underlying graph is a @xmath5-dimensional grid graph of linear order @xmath23 with periodic boundary conditions we mean it simply to be the cartesian product of @xmath5 cycles on @xmath23 vertices , so that @xmath24 .",
    "when we refer to the complete graph we mean the graph where all pairs of vertices are connected by an edge , thus having @xmath25 edges . for @xmath2",
    "we have collected data using wolff - cluster updating for @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 . the number of measurements at each temperature near @xmath0 ranges from ca @xmath34 for @xmath35 to more than @xmath36 for @xmath37 .",
    "we will also re - use some extremely detailed data from @xcite for @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "recall that the complete graph @xmath42 on @xmath9 vertices is the graph with @xmath9 vertices in which every pair of of distinct vertices is joined by an edge .",
    "the limit as @xmath43 of the ising model on @xmath42 corresponds to the usual mean field ising model . in order to be able to make a detailed comparison with the @xmath5-dimensional ising model we will now derive an expression for the specific heat of the mean field model in a neighbourhood of the critical point , instead of the more common textbook version which only gives the jump exactly at the critical point .",
    "first note that it is an exercise to show that @xmath44 and , more importantly , @xmath45 this will come in handy when we compute @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",
    "it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the magnetisation distribution at coupling @xmath48 for a complete graph is @xmath49 where @xmath50 . since @xmath51 this implicitly defines @xmath52",
    "when @xmath53 the distribution is precisely flat in the middle , i.e. with @xmath54 ( for even @xmath9 ) and thus @xmath55 constitutes an effective @xmath0 .",
    "the appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite provides detailed information on the moments of this magnetisation distribution and we will apply this to get information on the energy moments .",
    "we begin with the case of @xmath56 . with @xmath50",
    "this corresponds to @xmath57 , i.e. we move around inside the scaling window with the temperature parameter @xmath58 .",
    "using lemma a6 of ref .",
    "@xcite ( after setting @xmath59 ) we can now easily obtain the asymptotic form of the @xmath60th moment as @xmath61 where @xmath62 . plugging this into equation   and evaluating the integrals we can obtain a formula for @xmath63 .",
    "however , in the special case @xmath64 , we get the very simple @xmath65 the local maximum of @xmath63 can now be computed numerically to lie at @xmath66 and the value at this point is @xmath67 .",
    "we note also the limits @xmath68 and @xmath69 .    to continue with the case outside the scaling window we set @xmath70 which , since @xmath50 , gives us @xmath71 , our normalised temperature .",
    "in the high - temperature case , i.e. for @xmath72 , we get from lemma a9 ( setting @xmath73 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite that @xmath74 so that @xmath75 and thus @xmath76 .",
    "this could be interpreted as @xmath77 .",
    "the case @xmath78 was treated above as @xmath64 .",
    "the low - temperature case @xmath79 is a little more tricky .",
    "let @xmath80 , where @xmath81 , denote the normalised ( spontaneous ) magnetisation and note that the magnetisation distribution has a peak at @xmath82 having width @xmath83 .",
    "moving @xmath84 magnetisation steps away from @xmath85 we are at the new magnetisation @xmath86 where @xmath87 .",
    "lemma a13 says that the ratio @xmath88 is asymptotically @xmath89 and the @xmath60th moment then becomes @xmath90    using equation   the specific heat limit , expressed in @xmath91 , collapses into the simple form @xmath92 next , lemma a11  @xcite , after setting @xmath73 , says that @xmath91 depends on @xmath93 as asymptotically @xmath94 in combination with equation   this defines implicitly the limit specific heat in terms of @xmath93 .",
    "taking the composition of the series expansion of equation   and the inverse series expansion of equation   we obtain at last @xmath95 plotting the numerical evaluation of and we get the figure  [ fig : ckn ] where the limit and some finite cases are shown .     versus @xmath93 , with @xmath14 for finite @xmath96 , @xmath33 , @xmath97 @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 ( increasing blue curves ) and the complete graph limit case @xmath101 ( red thick curve ) . the red dot is the limit at @xmath78.,scaledwidth=48.3% ]",
    "we now come to our monte carlo results for @xmath2 .",
    "as noted in @xcite some of the indicators used by other authors to study the critical behaviour for @xmath2 are very sensitive to the exact value of the critical temperature @xmath0 . with this in mind",
    "we will first present a new way of obtaining highly precise estimates for @xmath0 and use it to derive the estimate which we will use in our later analysis .",
    "our improved estimate of @xmath0 , suitable for @xmath102 , is based on a careful study of the magnetisation distribution , i.e. @xmath103 . the approach is simple but assumes that all measurements of @xmath104 were stored for each temperature during the sampling process .",
    "after normalising these values as @xmath105 we put them in bins of reasonable width , in our case @xmath106 , thus giving us a histogram . there are of course several different binning methods to choose from , but for simplicity we have chosen to use a fixed bin width which is roughly what the freedman - diaconis method ( twice the interquartile range divided by the cube root of the number of measurements ) prescribes when the distribution is near @xmath107 ( see below ) for the weakest data set ( i.e. for @xmath35 ) .",
    "the simple distribution density function @xmath108 is then fitted to this histogram . since @xmath109 for all intents and purposes depends linearly on @xmath48 inside the scaling window ( see fig .  3 of @xcite )",
    ", we fit a straight line to the data points ( at least seven ) on the interval corresponding to @xmath110 and solve @xmath111 .",
    "this point constitutes an effective critical temperature @xmath107 scaling as @xmath112 , see  @xcite .",

    "<S> in this paper we investigate the behaviour of the specific heat around the critical point of the ising model in dimension 5 to 7 . we find a specific heat discontinuity , like that for the mean field ising model , and provide estimates for the left and right hand limits of the specific heat at the critical point . </S>",
    "<S> we also estimate the singular exponents , describing how the specific heat approaches those limits . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we make a smaller scale investigation of the same properties in dimension 6 and 7 , and provide strongly improved estimates for the critical termperature @xmath0 in @xmath1 which bring the best mc - estimate closer to those obtained by long high temperature series expanions . </S>"
