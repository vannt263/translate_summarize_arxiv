    "more than 30 x - ray binary pulsars ( xbp ) have been discovered in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) by the recent satellites such as asca , rxte , chandra , and xmm - newton ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "most of the xbps in the smc have been classified , or proposed to be be / x - ray binaries with the estimated ages of @xmath7  yrs .",
    "the number of the xbps normalized to the galaxy mass is far larger in the smc than in our galaxy ( @xcite ; @xcite )",
    ". this high population of xbps would be good evidence for the active star formation in the smc of @xmath8  yrs ago .",
    "other than the population study of the x - ray sources , the smc is a good local galaxy for the study of individual x - ray sources such as the emission mechanism of xbps , because the interstellar extinction for the member sources is very low and the line - of - sight galaxy depth is small ( @xmath9 10  kpc ) compared to the smc distance of @xmath10  kpc ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the former gives us soft x - ray information down to a few - hundred ev , while the latter provides us with a more accurate distance , and hence the x - ray luminosity , than those of the galactic sources .",
    "the large collective area of xmm - newton enables us to perform the x - ray spectroscopy down to the luminosities of @xmath11  ergs  s@xmath4 ( e.g. , @xcite ) even for more distant ( 60  kpc ) xbps than those in our galaxy ( typically 1@xmath020  kpc ) .",
    "ikt  1 was first discovered by @xcite with einstein .",
    "rosat observed this source many times and @xcite proposed this source to be a be / x - ray binary candidate from the flux variability and the existence of an optical counterpart with emission lines .",
    "asca also detected this source and found a flare - like behavior ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite plotted hardness ratios of x - ray sources in the smc against their luminosities and found that xbps reside in a restricted region .",
    "since ikt  1 is located in this region , ikt  1 is likely to be an xbp .",
    "using the xmm - newton archive data , we found coherent x - ray pulsations from this source .",
    "this paper reports on the discovery of a 263-s pulsation and the timing and spectrum analysis .",
    "discussion on the nature of ikt  1 is made focusing on the phase - resolved spectroscopy .",
    "independent detection of the 263-s pulsation was recently reported by haberl & pietsch .",
    "the source distance is assumed to be 60  kpc , the same value as the smc @xcite .",
    "the main objective of the xmm - newton ( @xcite ) observation made on oct .",
    "15 , 2000 was to study a supernova remnant ( snr ) , ikt  5 @xcite , and other x - ray sources around this snr . in this field , we found ikt  1 with a higher x - ray flux than the previous observations of rosat and asca , and hence we study the x - ray properties of this source . since epic / pn @xcite has better time resolution and statistics than mos1/2 @xcite , and ikt  1 accidentally fell in the ccd dip of mos2 , we concentrate on the x - ray data from epic / pn , and use the mos1 and 2 data for the consistency check .",
    "pn was operated in the extended full frame mode with the medium filter and the time resolution of 200  ms .",
    "we used the version 5.4.1 of the standard analysis system ( sas ) software for the event selection . from the detected pn events , we selected those with the pattern keywords between 0 and 4 as x - ray events .",
    "the exposure time was @xmath9 22  ks .",
    "the hard ( 2.0@xmath07.0  kev ) and soft ( 0.5@xmath02.0 kev ) band x - ray images are shown with two colors in figure  [ fig : image ] .",
    "three xbps ( ax  j0049.5@xmath07323 , ax  j0051@xmath0733 , ax  j0051.6@xmath07311 ; @xcitec , @xcite , @xciteb ) and 4 snrs ( 0044@xmath07325 , ikt  2 = n19 , ikt  5 = 0047@xmath0735 , ikt  6 = 0049@xmath0736 ; e.g. , @xcite ) are clearly found in the field of view ( fov ) .",
    "all the xbps appear as white point sources , and the snrs show red extended structures .",
    "blue color sources may be extra galactic agns .",
    "all the three pulsars mentioned above are identified with emission line objects ( elos ) cataloged by @xcite @xcite .",
    "the coordinates of these pulsars derived from the pn data are systematically shifted from the positions of the optical counterparts by ( @xmath12r.a . , @xmath12dec .",
    ") = ( @xmath0 , @xmath0 ) .",
    "we hence fine - tuned the pn coordinates to the optical coordinates . after this tuning ,",

    "although @xmath13-statistical error of this source position is only , a realistic error would be @xmath9 ( see the previous paragraph ) . since all the error regions of xmmu  j004723.3@xmath0731227 , ikt  1 @xcite , and rx  j0047.3@xmath07312 @xcite overlap , we conclude these three sources are the same x - ray object .",
    "( 80mm,50mm)figure1.eps      for the timing analysis of ikt  1 , x - ray photons were extracted from a circular region of 40 ",
    "radius centered on ikt  1 in the pn image .",
    "the light curves with the time bin of 500  s in the energy bands of 0.5@xmath02.0 and 2.0@xmath010.0  kev are shown in figure  [ fig : lc ] . in both the energy bands , we see several flare - like events on the general trend of decreasing flux .",
    "after the barycentric arrival time corrections , we searched for periodicity in the energy bands of 0.5@xmath02.0 and 2.0@xmath010.0  kev , using a fast fourier transformation algorism .",
    "figure  [ fig : psd ] shows the resultant power density spectra in the 3.8@xmath142.5  hz frequency band . in the 0.5@xmath02.0  kev band ,",
    "a maximum power of 81.6 was obtained at the frequency of @xmath15  hz ( @xmath16  s ) .",
    "since the probability to detect such a large power in any frequency from random events is only @xmath17 , the detection of the coherent pulsations is highly significant . in the 2.0@xmath010 kev band ,",
    "however , we see no significant power excess at this frequency .",
    "the other large power peak at @xmath18  hz is due to the periodic flares . unlike the coherent pulsations",
    ", this peak is found in both the energy bands .",
    "( 80mm,50mm)figure2.eps    ( 80mm,50mm)figure3.eps    we next performed epoch folding searches for the periods near the two power - peak frequencies .",
    "the flare - like events are found to have the most probable period of @xmath19  s. the barycentric period of the coherent pulsations is determined to be @xmath20  s. figure  [ fig : fold ] shows the folded pulse profiles at the period of 263  s in the 0.5@xmath02.0 and 2.0@xmath010.0  kev bands .",
    "we see no pulse modulation in the hard x - ray band , while the pulse profile found in the soft band is very peculiar : a flat top profile with a v - shape dip .",
    "( 80mm,50mm)figure4.eps      the x - ray spectrum was extracted from the same region as the timing analysis ( the 40-radius circle ) , while the background spectrum was extracted from the annular region around the source with the inner and outer radii of 40  and 80  , respectively .    since the pulse profiles are energy dependent , we made x - ray spectra separately , during the pulse minimum ( low ) and maximum ( high ) phases as shown in figure  [ fig : fold ] .",
    "the background subtracted spectra for the low and high phases are given in figure  [ fig : spec ] . in the hard x - ray band above @xmath93 kev ,",
    "the two x - ray spectra show essentially the same profile and flux , while below @xmath92 kev the spectrum of the high phase shows a large excess over that of the low phase .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with that the x - ray pulsation is found only in the soft x - ray band .",
    "( 80mm,50mm)figure5.eps    since both the spectra have a break at @xmath96  kev , we fitted the spectra with a broken power - law model .",
    "the photon indices , break energies and normalizations were simultaneously fitted , while the absorption columns were treated independently for each spectrum . in this paper ,",
    "the photoelectric absorption was calculated using the cross sections by @xcite assuming the solar abundance ratio @xcite .",
    "this model reproduced the hard energy band well , but left large residuals at the soft energy band , and was statistically rejected with a @xmath21degree of freedom ( d.o.f . ) = 160.9/129 .",
    "therefore the x - ray pulsation is not due to a periodic variation of the absorption .",
    "we then added a blackbody ( bb ) as the soft component to the broken power - law model and performed a simultaneous fit for the low- and high - phase spectra .",
    "the normalizations of the bb component were treated as independent parameters between the two phases . as a result ,",
    "the fit was acceptable with a @xmath22/d.o.f.=125.9/127 , with the best - fit parameters and models shown in table [ tab : spec ] and figure  [ fig : spec ] , respectively .",
    "lc parameters & value + broken power - law & + @xmath23 & @xmath24 + @xmath25 & @xmath26 + break energy & @xmath27 + norm & @xmath28 + blackbody & + @xmath29  ( kev ) & @xmath30 + @xmath31 ( `` low'')&@xmath32 + @xmath31 ( `` high '' ) & @xmath33 + @xmath34 [ @xmath3 ] & ( @xmath36 +    as for the 4000-s periodicity , we also made separate spectra for the high and low flux phases using the 4000-s folded light curve .",
    "these spectra are simultaneously fitted with the same two - component model as that for the case of the coherent pulsation ( 263  s ) ; we fixed the spectral parameters to the best - fit values given in table [ tab : spec ] except for the normalizations .",
    "in this case , we found an acceptable fit when the bb component is constant but only the normalizations of the broken power - law component varied between the high and low phases .",
    "therefore the 4000-s variation is attributable to the broken power - law component .",
    "to investigate a long - term flux variability , we accessed the heasarc archive and found that ikt  1 was in the field of 1 einstein / ipc , 6 rosat / pspc , and 4 rosat / hri observations .",
    "we extracted the source events from the circular regions of 60  , 50  and 20 \" radii centered on ikt  1 for the einstein / ipc , rosat / pspc and hri observations , respectively .",
    "the backgrounds are estimated using the same size regions in blank skies near the source .",
    "after the background subtraction and the vignetting correction , we estimated the source fluxes using the pimms software , and using the asca best - fit model @xcite . for comparison , the phase - averaged flux of the xmm - newton observation was also estimated using the same asca model . in table [ tab : flux ] , we summarize the long - term x - ray fluxes ( 0.7@xmath010.0  kev ) .",
    "we see that the xmm - newton flux at mjd 51832 is higher than the einstein , rosat and asca fluxes by more than @xmath37 times .",
    "thus a large long - term flux variation is clearly found .",
    "it should be noted that , in the asca observation , ikt  1 exhibited a large flare of about 10@xmath38  s duration @xcite .",
    ".flux history of ikt  1 [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the large long - term variability and the relatively low luminosity ( @xmath39  ergs  s@xmath4 from the rosat to xmm - newton observations ) suggest that ikt  1 is a wind - fed binary system .",
    "@xcite detected an emission line star from a star cluster near ikt  1 . using the rosat observation",
    ", @xcite proposed that one of the stars in this cluster is an optical counterpart of ikt  1 .",
    "we found only one cluster member , ogle  004723.37 - 731226.9 , is within the refined position error of ikt  1 by epic / pn observation ( the radius of @xmath40 ) , and hence this star must be an optical counterpart of ikt  1 .",
    "the long - term x - ray variation , the pulsation of 263  s and the power - law spectrum strongly support that ikt  1 is a be / x - ray binary pulsar ( be / xbp ) .",
    "since the space density of xbps is extremely high in the south - west part of the smc ( see figure  [ fig : image ] ) , and most of the xbps are be / xbps or strong candidates ( @xcite , @xciteb , @xcitec ) , this region must be an active star - formation site of some @xmath8  yrs ago .",
    "a h@xmath41 supergiant shell runs over this area ( @xcite ) and the age of the shell is estimated to be about @xmath42  yrs .",
    "this supergiant shell , therefore , probably triggered the proposed star formation activity about @xmath42  yrs ago .",
    "although our results put ikt  1 to a strong candidate of be / xbps , the detailed x - ray features , the presence of the pulsating soft component and the absence of a pulsation in the power - law component , are rather peculiar compared to the other be / xbps .",
    "the pulse profile of a flat top with a v - shape dip is also unique .    among the about 30 xbps ( and candidates ) in the magellanic clouds ,",
    "the soft component has been observed from only a few sources : smc  x-1 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , lmc  x-4 @xcite , rx  j0059.2@xmath07138 @xcite , exo  05319@xmath06609.2 @xcite , and xte  j0111.2@xmath07317 ( @xcitea ) ( see also @xcite , and references therein ) , where the latter 3 are be / xbps .",
    "thus ikt  1 may be the forth be / xbp with a clear soft component .    for rx  j0059.2@xmath07138",
    ", the soft component is modeled as a thin thermal plasma of @xmath43  kev and exhibits no pulsation @xcite .",
    "thus the origin would be a largely extended plasma of a comparable size with the binary separation .",
    "exo  053109@xmath06609.2 , on the other hand , shows a pulsation above 0.4  kev and both the soft and hard components may be pulsed @xcite .",
    "thus the origin of the soft component must be comparable with or smaller than the size of a neutron star ( ns ) .",
    "xte  j0111.2@xmath07317 has a peculiar spectrum of an inversely broken power - law model and shows pulsations both below and above the break energy ( @xcitea ) . unlike these 3 sources , ikt  1 shows the x - ray pulsations only in the soft component .",
    "@xcite reported that two xbps in the smc show pulsations mainly in the soft band .",
    "ax  j0049.5@xmath07323 ( @xcitec ) and rx  j0101.3@xmath07211 @xcite also show pulsations mainly in the soft components .",
    "the statistics of all the sources , however , were limited to distinguish whether or not the x - ray spectra are composed of pulsed soft and non - pulsed hard components . accordingly , ikt  1 is the first object which exhibits a two - component spectrum with a pulsed soft component and a non - pulsed hard component .",
    "the soft component can be modeled with a bb radiation of 0.47  kev temperature . using the x - ray luminosity of this bb in the high phase of the pulsation",
    ", the emission size is estimated to be @xmath44  km@xmath45 .",
    "this size is about 10% of the full surface of a ns , and hence the flux modulation along the ns rotation would be expected .",
    "a possible origin of the soft x - rays might be an opaque shell at the magnetosphere , which was first proposed by @xcite for the pulsating soft emission from her  x-1 .",
    "although the luminosity , hence the emission size of the soft emission from ikt  1 are significantly smaller than her  x-1 , this model is another possible origin of the pulsating soft x - ray emission .      in general , xbps exhibit a broken power - law spectrum in the hard component , which is likely coming from the small region near the pole , possibly the accretion column . the abnormal thomson scattering in the strong magnetic field and the cyclotron resonance absorption /",
    "emission would be responsible for the spectral break .",
    "since the hard component of ikt  1 has a typical broken power - law spectrum , it is highly possible that these x - rays originate from the accretion column near at the magnetic pole .",
    "a big puzzle , however , is that no coherent pulsation is found from this power - law component .    except pulsations ,",
    "the power - law component is highly variable with many flares with about 4000-s quasi - periodicity .",
    "a plausible case is that the 4000-s variation is due to quasi - periodic mass accretion .",
    "in fact , a long exposure ( 177  ks ) observation of asca @xcite showed a large flare with the duration of about @xmath46  s. no hint of the 4000-s variations was , however , found in the flare .",
    "the fainter flux of ikt  1 and the smaller effective area of asca than that of xmm - newton might have made it impossible to detect the 4000-s variations if any .",
    "quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) at frequencies of 5@xmath0220  mhz have been observed from @xmath910 xbps to date ( e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the canonical model of qpos in xbps is either a model of the beat - frequency between those of rotations of the ns ( @xmath47 ) and the kepler motion of the inner disk ( @xmath48 ) ( a beat frequency model : bfm ) , or a keplerian frequency model ( kfm ) . in the bfm ,",
    "the qpo frequency ( @xmath49 ) equals ( @xmath50 ) , where in the ikt  1 case @xmath51  mhz and @xmath52  mhz . as a result , @xmath53 of ikt  1",
    "must be about 4  mhz and the corresponding keplerian radius is about @xmath54  cm .",
    "the disk matter at the inner keplerian radius should be in pressure balance to the magnetospheric field . then assuming the radius and mass of ns to be @xmath55  km , @xmath56 , and using the x - ray luminosity of @xmath57  ergs  s@xmath4 , we estimate the surface magnetic field strength of the ns to be @xmath58  g ( cf .",
    "this value is beyond the range of normal nss ( or xbps ) , and hence the bfm is unlikely . in the kfm , the keplerian orbital period ( frequency ) of the inner disc is @xmath48 = @xmath59  mhz , and hence the radius is about @xmath60  cm , which is too far from the ns to produce the hard x - ray we observed .    in summary ,",
    "ikt  1 exhibits many unusual properties as an xbp , which must be a key for understanding the nature and x - ray emission mechanisms of this source . for a more quantitative study of this peculiar pulsar , a very long exposure observation with high sensitivity instruments like xmm - newton",
    "is highly anticipated .",
    "the einstein and rosat data are obtained through the high energy astrophysics science archive research center online service , provided by the nasa / goddard space flight center .",
