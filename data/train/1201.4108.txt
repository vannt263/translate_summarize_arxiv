    "progress has been made in estimating the information - theoretic capacity of the class of fiber - optic communication systems that are ( presently ) of commercial interest  @xcite , but existing systems perform far from the fundamental limits of the channel .",
    "while signal processing and coded modulation techniques promise to eliminate this gap , their implementations  at the speeds present in fiber - optic systems  present significant challenges .    many existing proposals for coded modulation in fiber - optic communication systems amount to using techniques currently used in electrical wireline and wireless communication systems .",
    "for example , in  @xcite , the authors propose a concatenated coding system with inner trellis - coded modulation ( for an 8-psk constellation ) and an outer product - like code , and in  @xcite , the authors propose using low - density parity - check ( ldpc ) codes for coded modulation . in both cases ,",
    "the proposals are verified by simulation , where the channel is assumed to be a classical additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) , but no consideration is given to the real - world implementation challenges for the proposed systems .",
    "other proposals for coded modulation in fiber - optic systems consider simplified channel models , and design codes for the resulting systems .",
    "for example , in  @xcite , the authors design a trellis - coded polarization - shift - keying modulation system , but their channel model only considers laser phase noise , i.e. , effects related to the propagation over fiber are completely ignored . in  @xcite ,",
    "the authors consider a nonlinear phase noise channel model studied by  @xcite , and design a multi - level coded modulation system with reed - solomon codes at each level .",
    "however , this channel model assumes a single - channel dispersion - less system , which is not of practical interest .    in this paper , we take a pragmatic approach to coded modulation for fiber - optic systems , that addresses the deficiencies of the aforementioned proposals . due to the fact that product - like codes with syndrome - based decoding have efficient high - speed decoders  @xcite",
    ", we consider systems with hard - decision decoding .",
    "furthermore , the channel model for which the codes are designed is not a simplified one , but rather is derived from ( computationally intensive ) simulations of the fiber - optic systems based on the generalized nonlinear schrdinger ( gnls ) equation [ ( [ eqn : gnls ] ) , below ] , and thus accurately models the non - awgn channel that occurs in optical communication systems .",
    "in contrast to most classically studied communication channels , optical fiber exhibits significant nonlinearity ( in the intensity of the guided light )  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , amplification acts as a source of distributed awgn , and fiber chromatic dispersion acts as a distributed linear filter .",
    "complicating matters , these three fundamental effects _ interact _ over the length of transmission . in  @xcite , signal processing is performed via digital backpropagation , in order to attempt to compensate the channel impairments .",
    "however , their results do not quantify the benefits of this compensation strategy . since digital backpropagation is computationally expensive",
    ", one approach to reducing the computational burden is to increase the step - size of the algorithm , as in  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we compare the achievable rates for two extreme cases : digital backpropagation ( as in  @xcite ) , and a linear equalizer ( which can be considered as a form of `` linear backpropagation '' in which the step - size is the system s length ) .    in section  [ sec : pre ] , we review staircase codes , the system model for a fiber - optic communication system , and digital backpropagation . in section",
    "[ sec : rates ] , we compare the transmission rates that can be achieved using digital backpropagation with those achievable by linear equalization . in section  [ sec : cmod ] , we present the details of a pragmatic coded modulation system , and compare the performance of the system to the capacity estimates .",
    "staircase codes  @xcite are a family of high - rate binary error - correcting codes suitable for high - speed fiber - optic communications .",
    "staircase codes can be interpreted as _ generalized _ ldpc codes , that is , sparse graph - based codes whose constraint nodes are error-_correcting _ codes , not the single - parity - check error-_detecting _ codes used in the constraint nodes of conventional ldpc codes . with such generalized ldpc codes ,",
    "algebraic decoding can be applied at the constraint nodes , and the decoder can operate exclusively on syndromes . as discussed in @xcite , this significantly reduces the decoder data - flow ( relative to a message - passing ldpc decoder ) , admitting an efficient high - speed implementation .",
    "furthermore , due to the error correcting capabilities of the constraint nodes , staircase codes have very low error floors , which can be estimated analytically .",
    "finally , due to their structural properties , staircase codes provide superior performance to product codes .",
    "staircase codes are completely characterized by the relationship between successive matrices of symbols .",
    "specifically , consider the ( infinite ) sequence @xmath5 of @xmath6-by-@xmath6 matrices @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "block @xmath9 is initialized to a reference state known to the encoder - decoder pair , e.g. , block @xmath9 could be initialized to the all - zeros state , i.e. , an @xmath6-by-@xmath6 array of zero symbols .",
    "furthermore , we select a conventional fec code ( e.g. , hamming , bch , reed - solomon , etc . ) in systematic form to serve as the _ component _ code ; this code , which we henceforth refer to as @xmath10 , is selected to have blocklength @xmath11 symbols , @xmath12 of which are parity symbols .    generally , the relationship between successive blocks in a staircase code satisfies the following relation : for any @xmath13 , each of the rows of the matrix @xmath14 $ ] is a valid codeword in @xmath10 . just as in a conventional product code , any given symbol in any given block @xmath7 participates in two constraints : one to satisfy the condition that each row of @xmath15 $ ] is a codeword of @xmath10 , and one to satisfy the condition that each row of @xmath16 $ ] is a codeword of @xmath10 .",
    "we consider a coherent fiber - optic communication system . between the transmitter and receiver , standard - single - mode fiber and ideal distributed raman amplification",
    "are assumed , but we note that the methods presented herein also apply to alternate system configurations ( e.g. , systems with inline dispersion - compensating fiber , and/or lumped amplification ) . the complex baseband representation of the signal in a single polarization at the output of the transmitter is @xmath17 , and at the input of the receiver is @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the total system length ; note that @xmath20 represents the full field , i.e. , in general it represents co - propagating dense wavelength - division - multiplexed signals .",
    "the generalized non - linear schrdinger ( gnls ) equation expresses the evolution of @xmath20 : @xmath21 since ideal distributed raman amplification is assumed , the loss term has been omitted , and @xmath22 is a circularly symmetric complex gaussian noise process with autocorrelation @xmath23 = \\alpha h v_s k_t \\delta(z - z',t - t'),\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is planck s constant , @xmath25 is the optical frequency , and @xmath26 is the phonon occupancy factor . in table",
    "[ tab : param ] , we provide parameter values for the system components .    note that the scalar equation ( [ eqn : gnls])whose numerical solution is used to generate all of the results of this paper  governs propagation of waveforms in a single polarization mode .",
    "the achievable rates for a dual - polarized transmission system would be approximately ( but slightly less than ) twice as large as for the single polarization system considered here , but a more complicated vector version of ( [ eqn : gnls ] ) , taking into account the effects of fiber birefringence and coupling between the polarization modes as well as the stochastic nature of polarization mode dispersion , would need to be considered .",
    ".system parameter values [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     [ tab : scbicm ]",
    "we showed that digital backpropagation increases the achievable spectral efficiencies  relative to linear equalization  by @xmath3 to @xmath4 bits / s / hz per polarization .",
    "we proposed a pragmatic coded modulation system that incorporates signal shaping and exploits the excellent performance and efficient high - speed decoding architecture of staircase codes .",
