    "recently there has been considerable interest in dimensionally reduced yang - mills theories as a means to obtain non - perturbative information on superstring theory and m - theory .",
    "the possible relevance of these systems to quantum gravity appeared in @xcite through the light cone quantization of the 11-dimensional supermembrane .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that 10-dimensional @xmath0 super yang - mills theory reduced to one dimension ",
    "i.e.  matrix quantum mechanics  correctly quantizes the supermembrane in the large @xmath2 limit .",
    "the very same system , first studied ( without reference to applications to quantum gravity ) in @xcite , has recently been interpreted as a non - perturbative attempt at m - theory @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , on the technical side , very little is known about this model : it is suspected @xcite , @xcite that a novel , intricate large @xmath2 limit is required , but only few concrete results are available .",
    "this motivates the study of a simpler system : the complete reduction of yang - mills theory to @xmath3 dimensions .",
    "in addition , the reduction of the ten - dimensional susy gauge theory path integral to a matrix integral has been at the heart of an alternative proposal to directly define non - perturbative iib string theory @xcite .",
    "more generally we may study the complete reduction of d - dimensional @xmath0 yang - mills theory .",
    "then the path integral of the field theory simplifies to an integral over the group s lie algebra , with a flat measure : a _ yang - mills integral_. denoting the gauge potential by @xmath4 and their superpartners by @xmath5 we obtain    @xmath6 . \\label{susyint}\\ ] ]    with the euclidean `` action '' @xmath7 [ x_\\mu , x_\\nu ] -   \\tr \\psi_{\\alpha } [ \\gamma_{\\alpha \\beta}^{\\mu } x_{\\mu},\\psi_{\\beta } ] .",
    "\\label{action}\\ ] ] the _ a priori _ allowed dimensions for the reduced supersymmetric gauge theory are @xmath8 corresponding to @xmath9 real supersymmetries . for the bosonic , i.e.  the non - supersymmetric case @xmath10 , we omit the grassmann variables @xmath5 , and may study all dimensions @xmath11 .",
    "there are numerous further reasons for being interested in the integrals eq.([susyint ] ) :    @xmath12 the susy integrals are crucial for the computation of the witten index of the above mentioned quantum mechanical gauge theories , as they contribute to the so - called bulk part of the index @xcite ( cf also @xcite for an earlier calculation ) .",
    "@xmath12 in the maximally supersymmetric case , the system describes to leading order the statistical distribution of a system of @xmath2 d - instantons ( or `` @xmath13-branes '' ) .",
    "@xmath12 the @xmath14 integral appears in very recent work developing a multi - instanton calculus for the @xmath15 , @xmath16 @xmath17 conformal gauge theory @xcite , and again in the large @xmath2 limit of sp@xmath18 and so(@xmath2 ) @xmath15 susy gauge theory @xcite .",
    "@xmath12 finally we can regard the integrals eq.([susyint ] ) as a version of the eguchi - kawai reduced gauge theory . the original work @xcite focused on a lattice formulation and employed unitary matrices , while the above integrals use the hermitean gauge connections @xmath4",
    "this is similar to @xcite ; however , we apply neither gauge fixing nor quenching prescriptions to the above integrals .",
    "the interesting question is whether the models eq.([susyint ] ) encode universal information on the full gauge field theory as @xmath19 .",
    "the integrals of eq.([susyint ] ) appear to be singular due to the `` valleys '' of the action , i.e.  the directions in the configuration space of the @xmath4 where all @xmath20 matrices commute .",
    "recent work has however proven this intuition wrong : yang - mills integrals _ do _ exist in many interesting cases .",
    "indeed , the rigorous results of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) show that for the gauge group @xmath1 the susy integrals converge in dimensions @xmath21 .",
    "the calculations are easily repeated for the bosonic case @xcite , and the convergence condition @xmath22 is found .",
    "unfortunately , no rigorous methods exist to date for higher rank gauge groups @xmath23 .    in @xcite , @xcite,@xcite we developed methods to numerically test convergence of singular multidimensional integrals .",
    "the idea is to perform a metropolis random walk weighted by the integrand , and to merely measure the autocorrelation function of subsequent configurations . in this approach ,",
    "a unit autocorrelation function signals the presence of a nonintegrable singularity .    as an illustration we plot in fig.1 the autocorrelation function of the @xmath1 bosonic integrals .",
    "( 200,180 ) ( -300,-120 )   ( 40,-120 )   ( 360,-120 )     fig .",
    "1 _ autocorrelation functions versus monte carlo time for the @xmath1 bosonic integral with , from the left , @xmath24 . + _    we are clearly able to reproduce the convergence condition @xmath22 : for @xmath25 the configurations decorrelate well and the whole integration space is properly sampled .",
    "( one observes increasingly improved decorrelation for @xmath26 , not shown in fig.1 . )",
    "in contrast for @xmath27 the system gets quickly trapped in a singular configuration : the markov chain gets lost in a valley , and the integral is divergent .",
    "@xmath16 shows marginal divergence , which agrees with the exact analytical results .    applying the same method to higher rank bosonic models , and to the supersymmetric models , we are able to map out the convergence conditions for the yang - mills integrals .",
    "they read @xmath28 in particular the @xmath27 susy integral is divergent ( see @xcite,@xcite,@xcite for a more detailed discussion of this point )",
    ".    it would be nice to have a rigorous mathematical proof of the conditions ( [ intcond ] ) .",
    "some understanding may be gained by considering one - loop perturbative estimates of the integrals eq.([susyint ] ) .",
    "one has for the supersymmetric case @xcite @xmath29~\\times \\nonumber\\\\ & \\times~\\sum_{g:\\;{\\rm maximal \\ ; tree}}~ \\prod_{(ij):\\;{\\rm link \\ ; of } \\ ; g}~{1 \\over ( x^i - x^j)^{3 ( d-2 ) } } + \\ldots \\label{susyfluct}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath30 are the diagonal components of the matrices @xmath4 , while it is found in @xcite that the bosonic integrals are approximated by @xmath31~   \\prod_{i < j}~{1 \\over ( x^i - x^j)^{2 ( d-2)}}.   \\label{fluct}\\ ] ] powercounting for large separations @xmath32 yields precisely eq.([intcond ] )",
    ". however , it should be stressed that this does not prove the convergence conditions , since one has to worry about configurations where some separations are small , so that the one - loop approximation becomes invalid .    in the supersymmetric case the value for the integrals",
    "is believed to be known : @xmath33    the @xmath14 expression was conjectured by green and gutperle @xcite based on a calculation of the d - instanton effective action of the superstring .",
    "a derivation of the terms to the right of the curly bracket in eq.([index ] ) , based on cohomological deformation techniques , was given in @xcite .",
    "this calculation has still an important loophole ( see comments in @xcite ) .",
    "however , the formula eq.([index ] ) was numerically checked by monte carlo techniques in @xcite,@xcite up to @xmath34 .    for the bosonic case no exact value of the partition function",
    "is known except for @xmath1 @xcite , where the result reads @xmath35    it would be exciting to find the generalization of this result to higher rank gauge groups  this is after all the `` zero - mode '' contribution to the yang - mills partition function on a d - dimensional torus .",
    "let us shift attention from the partition functions to the correlation functions of the models .",
    "the simplest correlators are @xmath0 invariant one - matrix correlators : the moments @xmath36 of one matrix , say the @xmath20-th : @xmath37 .",
    "these are directly related to the distribution of eigenvalues of the matrix : if the eigenvalues of @xmath37 are @xmath38 , the eigenvalue density is defined for all @xmath2 as @xmath39 the non - zero moments of @xmath40 are then given by @xmath41 in an ordinary wigner type matrix model all moments exist .",
    "yang - mills integrals are more intricate .",
    "analytical calculations have only been performed for @xmath1 , and we found the following surprising results . in the @xmath16",
    "susy integral all moments are infinite , even though the integral itself exists , as argued above . in the @xmath42 susy",
    "integral the first two moments are finite and one finds @xmath43 while all higher moments diverge . for the @xmath44 susy integral we have exactly twelve finite moments which are",
    "@xmath45 it would be interesting to find a geometrical or combinatorial interpretation for these numbers . which densities give rise to this convergence behavior ?",
    "for @xmath1 we can go farther and find the exact densities : @xmath46   \\nonumber\\\\ \\rho_{d=10}^{\\rm{susy}}(\\lambda)&= & \\frac{1287}{64\\cdot 2^{3/4}\\ , \\sqrt{\\pi } } \\ , \\lambda^2\\ , \\bigl [ 546\\ ,   u(\\frac{17}{4 } , \\frac{1}{2 } , 8\\lambda^4 ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad -147\\ , \\frac{17\\cdot 19}{8}\\ ,   u(\\frac{21}{4 } , \\frac{1}{2 } , 8\\lambda^4 ) \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad + 45\\ , \\frac{17\\cdot 19\\cdot 21\\cdot 23}{256}\\ ,    u(\\frac{25}{4 } , \\frac{1}{2 } , 8\\lambda^4 ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad   -\\frac{17\\cdot 19\\cdot 21\\cdot 23\\cdot 25\\cdot 27}{2048}\\ ,   u(\\frac{29}{4 } , \\frac{1}{2 } , 8\\lambda^4)\\ , \\bigl ] \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the kummer-@xmath47 function defined as @xmath48 now we see that the above finiteness properties of the moments result from a rather curious powerlike behavior of the densities at large values of @xmath49 .",
    "we have for @xmath50 @xmath51 this power - like behavior is very different from wigner type systems where the fall - off at infinity is at least exponential . for the @xmath20-dimensional bosonic models the density",
    "can be worked out as well albeit less explicitly than in eqs.([exactrho ] ) , and one finds the asymptotic behavior @xmath52 .    moving on to higher values of @xmath2 , we are unable to analytically calculate the eigenvalue densities with presently known techniques .",
    "we can , however , find numerically exact densities using monte carlo methods . in fig.2",
    "we illustrate this by plotting the @xmath53 @xmath16 susy half - densities ( we only plot the @xmath54 part since the densities are symmetric functions ) . in the @xmath1 case the exact expression of eq.([exactrho ] ) and the monte carlo data can not be separated on the scale of the figure .",
    "now we would like to know how the @xmath1 result eq.([asymp ] ) generalizes to other values of @xmath2 .",
    "it is impossible to extract the asymptotics from histograms such as fig.2 , since the tails comprise only a small number of samples . instead",
    ", we can go back to the markov - chain technique of the last section and measure the finiteness of the moments eq.([corr ] ) for various values of @xmath2 .",
    "we find that for the susy integrals the qualitative behavior of the @xmath1 case persists : in the @xmath21 integrals only the first , respectively , @xmath55 moments are finite .",
    "we thus conclude , in view of eq.([corr ] ) , that the asymptotic behavior _ eq.([asymp ] ) is valid for all @xmath2_. this is very different from wigner type random matrix models , where as @xmath2 increases , the density condenses onto a compact interval . at the sharply defined ( at @xmath56 )",
    "edge of the interval wigner distributions show universal behavior .",
    "we have argued that in susy yang - mills matrix models no such edge exists , indicating that _ the large @xmath2 physics of these models is indeed very different_.    ( 200,180 ) ( -320,220 )   ( 20,220 )   ( 360,220 )     fig .",
    "2 _ eigenvalue ( half-)densities for susy @xmath16 , from the left , @xmath53 + _    let us furthermore compare supersymmetric and non - supersymmetric yang - mills integrals .",
    "how does the asymptotic behavior of the density eq.([asymp ] ) change in the absence of susy ?",
    "we have already mentioned above that for @xmath1 this behavior is powerlike as well .",
    "actually we can guess a general formula by looking once more at the effective one - loop estimate of eq.([fluct ] ) . for one - matrix correlators",
    "the most dangerous configuration stems from pulling away one coordinate @xmath57 from a bulk configuration of all other @xmath58 coordinates .",
    "powercounting leads to the guess @xmath59 the same procedure applied to the susy estimate eq.([susyfluct ] ) reproduces eq.([asymp ] ) .",
    "we then verified the validity of eq.([bosasymp ] ) by the same monte carlo random walk procedure as above , measuring the finiteness of moments .",
    "we thus notice a marked difference to the susy situation : in the bosonic case _ all moments exist _ as @xmath19 for all @xmath60 .",
    "in particular we expect the eigenvalue distribution to condense onto a compact support , much like for wigner type models .",
    "a further natural set of correlation functions of yang - mills matrix integrals are wilson loops . due to the eguchi - kawai mechanism @xcite,@xcite , one _ naively _ expects them to correspond at @xmath56 to wilson loops in the unreduced gauge field theory . in the proposal of @xcite for a non - perturbative definition of the iib superstring",
    ", they have been interpreted as string creation operators @xcite .    despite the dimensional reduction of the field theory to zero dimensions",
    "we are still able to define an infinite set of independent wilson loops dependent on an arbitrary contour @xmath61 in @xmath20-dimensional euclidean space : @xmath62 due to the non - commutative nature of the connections @xmath63 and the path - ordering @xmath64 , this is a non - trivial functional of the contour @xmath61 despite the fact that the @xmath63 are spacially constant . in the special case of a rectangular contour with lengths @xmath65 and @xmath66 in the @xmath67 plane",
    "this simplifies to @xmath68 we would like to understand how the loops @xmath69 behave as a function of @xmath2 and as a functional of the shape of the contours , in particular whether planar loops satisfy an area - law .",
    "we would also like to see whether there are any telltale differences between the supersymmmetric and the bosonic loops .    in the previous sections we have shown how a number of exact results may be derived for the simplest gauge group @xmath1 .",
    "we have not been able to analytically calculate a wilson loop for an yang - mills integral even for @xmath1 . on the other hand it is possible to obtain high precision numerical results for low values of @xmath2 . in fig.3a",
    "we plot the wilson loop for a square ( @xmath70 ) in the case of susy @xmath16 as a function of @xmath65 for various values of @xmath2 .",
    "( 200,180 ) ( -200,-40 )   ( 200,-40 )     fig . 3 @xmath16 susy wilson loops _ ( a ) square of side length @xmath65 with @xmath71 ( top to bottom ) ( b ) square , regular 16-gon and 64-gon enclosed in circle of radius @xmath72 with @xmath73 . + _",
    "the behavior for small area is easy to understand . indeed , for an arbitrary planar loop enclosing a small area of size @xmath74 , it is straightforward to show , using stokes theorem , that @xmath75 ^ 2 \\rangle + { { \\cal o}}(x^6)$ ] .",
    "this immediately gives @xmath76 and agrees to high precision with the numerical data .",
    "a very curious feature of fig.3a is that the loops tend to a constant for large area .",
    "the existence of this constant can be demonstrated analytically .",
    "it should be considered a finite @xmath2 artifact for the following reasons : ( a ) the constant decreases with @xmath2 , as seen in fig.3a .",
    "( b ) the constant depends in various ways on the shape of the contour .",
    "we checked that by distorting the rectangle to a slightly irregular quadrangle the constant drops to zero for all @xmath2 as the size increases .",
    "in fig3.b we show various regular polygons approximating a circle of radius @xmath72 : as we increase the number of edges the constant goes to zero for large @xmath72 .",
    "it is clear from the mentioned features of the wilson loops that there is an area law neither for very small nor very large areas .",
    "an intermediate region in which an area law holds might still be present .",
    "we checked , by going to rather larger @xmath2 , that this is not the case for the bosonic models .",
    "there has been an interesting suggestion @xcite that such an intermediate region may exist for the @xmath16 supersymmetric model .",
    "we showed how numerical markov chain methods can be used to verify _ non - perturbative _ convergence conditions for yang - mills integrals with and without supersymmetry .",
    "the same methods may be applied to establish the convergence properties of correlation functions . applying the technique to invariant correlators of a single matrix , we are able to accurately predict the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalue density of yang - mills matrix models .",
    "the results demonstrate an unusual powerlaw behavior which , in the supersymmetric cases , persists for large @xmath2 .",
    "this indicates that the large @xmath2 limit of these `` new '' matrix models might indeed be very different from the one of the `` old '' wigner type models .",
    "we also demonstrated that monte carlo methods are capable to rather accurately compute various quantities relevant to these models such as partition functions , correlation functions , spectral distributions and wilson loops .",
    "as opposed to yang - mills quantum mechanics @xcite,@xcite,@xcite we are confronted to a system which allows some non - perturbative analysis , at least for finite @xmath2 .",
    "yang - mills integrals are thus an ideal laboratory for exploring new large @xmath2 techniques .",
    "powerful analytical methods will have to be developed if we are to verify or , maybe more importantly , if we are to bring to good use the ideas presented in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
