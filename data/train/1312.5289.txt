    "the remarkable creation of quantized vortices in a gas of @xmath2rb atoms without external rotation of the condensate  @xcite has stimulated much theoretical and experimental activity .",
    "previously , most vortex experiments in ultracold dilute bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) relied on rotation of the condensate  @xcite , which is the analog of the rotating bucket generally used for both superfluid @xmath3he and superfluid @xmath4he .    in the past decade , however , a different picture of a rotating system has emerged .",
    "this new view arises from the details of the well - known transformation of the hamiltonian to a rotating frame @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the angular velocity of the rotating frame .",
    "it yields a schrdinger equation similar to that for a charged particle in a uniform magnetic field .",
    "specifically , the rotation induces a synthetic ( or artificial ) vector potential with an effective `` symmetric '' gauge field @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the particle mass ( see  @xcite for a recent review of this exciting field ) .",
    "when a particle with charge @xmath9 travels from @xmath10 to @xmath11 in the presence of a vector potential @xmath12 , its wave function acquires a phase @xmath13 .",
    "if by some means , one can create such a phase , even a neutral atom can experience a synthetic gauge field .",
    "hence much of the recent work on cold atoms has focused on phase engineering of the quantum wave function , particularly the possibility of studying many - body systems  @xcite that may not be readily accessible in conventional condensed - matter materials .",
    "spielman and his group have used raman - induced transitions and a magnetic field gradient to generate such a spatially varying synthetic vector potential @xmath14 that acts like `` landau '' gauge and yields a nearly uniform synthetic magnetic field ( equivalent to the uniform rotation of most previous experiments ) . in this way",
    ", they created a system of quantized vortices at rest in the laboratory frame  @xcite .",
    "they subsequently made a form of spin - orbit coupling in a two - component bec  @xcite with the synthetic gauge field @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a pauli matrix that acts on the two components of the state vector ( see  @xcite for a recent review ) .",

    "@xcite studied the question of vortex formation in a spin - orbit coupled bec .",
    "they point out the difficulty of stirring such a condensate by the familiar technique of external rotation , which would involve rotating not only the trap but also the raman laser beams ( and perhaps also the external magnetic field ) .",
    "stimulated by these concerns , i here explore the dynamics of a vortex in such a two - component spin - orbit coupled bec that is stationary in the laboratory frame and hence nonrotating .    in an elegant experiment ,",

    "roughly 25% of the time , they created a vortex with random @xmath17 orientation of the circulation . to monitor the vortex dynamics in real time",
    ", they applied a short microwave pulse to transfer about 5% of the condensate atoms to an untrapped state that falls and expands , making visible the position of the vortex as a hole in the condensate density . repeating this process up to @xmath18 8 times yields time - lapse pictures of the vortex motion .",
    "the resulting sequence of images shows clearly the position of the moving vortex .",
    "this method of vortex creation is important because it does not rely on rotation of the condensate ( see  @xcite for a different valuable nonrotating approach to the dynamics of a vortex dipole / pair ) . in principle",
    "this technique  @xcite could also serve to study vortex dynamics in a spin - orbit coupled bec .",
    "note , however , that the presence of a zeeman magnetic field  @xcite would necessitate a laser dipole trap and a modified approach to releasing a sequence of small samples to image the vortex motion  @xcite .",
    "if it is indeed possible to create a vortex in a nonrotating spin - orbit coupled bec , each component must have single - valued circulation .",
    "there is no obvious requirement that the two components have the same circulation , even though such states may have higher energy .",
    "this study seeks observable features of the vortex motion that would identify such unusual states with different circulation in the two components .",
    "one possibility would be unit circulation in one component and zero circulation in the other , which would be an analog of the `` half - quantum '' vortex predicted to occur in superfluid @xmath0he - a films  @xcite and in similar chiral @xmath1-wave ( @xmath19 ) superconductors such as sr@xmath20ruo@xmath21  @xcite .",

    "the single - component thermal - quench experiment  @xcite uses a magnetic harmonic trap that allows the transition from the bound hyperfine state to one that is not bound .",
    "such a trap is probably infeasible for a spin - orbit coupled system that requires an external magnetic field to split the zeeman hyperfine levels .",
    "reference  @xcite studies the corresponding situation in an optical trap and shows that it remains possible to out - couple a small fraction of the condensate to provide successive images , presumably even for a spin - orbit coupled bec .",
