    "infrared optical absorption measurements@xcite on charge - transfer insulators such as sr@xmath2cuo@xmath1 and the isostructural compound ca@xmath2cuo@xmath1 have shown that these experiments provide important insights in our understanding of the spin dynamics of the underlying cuo@xmath1 chains .",
    "the observed bands are analogous to the bands found in cuprates with cuo planes@xcite at mid infrared energies .",
    "although direct absorption of magnetic excitations is not possible in the usual optical transitions induced by dipole interaction , they are allowed by the assistance of phonons@xcite whose effect is to effectively lower the symmetry of the lattice giving rise to a finite dipole moment@xcite .",
    "this effective dipole moment for processes involving one phonon and spin excitations has been obtained perturbatively starting from the three - band hubbard model in the presence of slowly varying electric and phonon fields ( see ref .",

    "@xmath3 although the energy spectrum of this many - body quantum problem has been solved a long time ago@xcite , the computation of its dynamical properties remains a challenge .",
    "so far most of the numerical results on dynamical properties come from exact diagonalization of small systems , and more recently from quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations combined with the maximum entropy ( maxent ) analytic continuation procedure of noisy data .",
    "this combination has been used to calculate the dynamical spin correlation function of the 1d@xcite and 2d@xcite heisenberg model and correctly describes the inelastic neutron scattering of cucl@xmath2.2n(c@xmath4h@xmath4)@xcite and la@xmath2cuo@xmath5@xcite .",
    "the estimated intrachain exchange energy of sr@xmath2cuo@xmath1 is @xmath6@xcite .",
    "for an electric field parallel to the cuo@xmath1 chain the absorption band at low temperatures ( @xmath7 ) is wide , starts at the relevant phonon frequency ( @xmath8ev ) , extends up to @xmath9ev ( the maximum energy of two spinons dispersion ) and has a singularity at @xmath10ev ( the maximum of the des cloizeaux - pearson dispersion ) .",
    "for an electric field perpendicular to the chain axis , the spectrum is weak and structureless .",
    "this kind of response is typical of 1d systems .",
    "experimental features@xcite of the optical absorption spectrum @xmath11 of these materials may be analysed applying ls idea of phonon - assisted multimagnon optical absorption with a @xmath12 analytical ansatz for the dynamical energy correlation function ( decf)@xcite .",
    "numerical studies show that at @xmath12 the dynamical structure factor and the decf of the afh model have a significant structure in the @xmath13 plane between @xmath14 ( the des cloizeaux - pearson dispersion relation ) and @xmath15 , the maximum of the two - spinon continuum . at zero temperature",
    "the ls mechanism gives structure at the energy of the relevant phonon plus the energy of the magnetic excitations and the computed spectrum is in excellent agreement with the experimental one@xcite at low temperatures .",
