    "optical fields with non - zero orbital angular momentum ( oam ) , which show a non - gaussian transverse amplitude and phase profiles @xcite , are of great interest in a myriad of scientific and technological applications , such as secure communications @xcite , ultra - precise measurements @xcite , nano - particle manipulation @xcite or quantum computing @xcite .",
    "these applications push forward the development of new methods aimed at the preparation of optical fields with oam in both the classical and quantum ( i.e. single - photon ) regimes .",
    "paired photons with nonzero oam are widely generated nowadays via the nonlinear optical process of spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) , where photons are generated in pairs ( signal and idler ) .",
    "such paired photons can show quantum correlations ( entanglement ) in several degrees of freedom including polarization , frequency , or momentum .",
    "entanglement may occur also in the oam degree of freedom @xcite , as experimentally demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "states with the winding numbers around 300 have already been observed in volume optics @xcite .",
    "dimensions of this entanglement reaching even @xmath3 are theoretically predicted in @xcite .",
    "however , the generation of oam entanglement in optical fibers still represents a challenge , which solution could open the door for many applications that would benefit from using guided modes ( low losses in optical elements , long transmission distances ) .",
    "recently , guided oam states in fibers with the winding numbers up to 1 have been observed @xcite .",
    "there are mainly two problems to overcome . on the one hand",
    ", the presence of inverse symmetry in ideally cylindrically - shaped silicon optical fibers excludes the existence of @xmath1 nonlinearity . for this reason , photon pairs in optical fibers are generally generated by means of an alternative nonlinear process ( four - wave mixing ) which utilizes instead the third - order nonlinearity of silicon @xcite .",
    "small values of the elements of @xmath4 nonlinear tensor can be compensated by increasing the interaction length to give higher photon - pair fluxes .",
    "unfortunately , this is accompanied by equal enhancement of other effects , i.e. , raman scattering , that cause unwanted higher noise contributions to the generated flux .",
    "nevertheless , silicon optical fibers can become nonlinear using the method of thermal poling @xcite which provides a nonzero @xmath1 susceptibility and also enables to employ quasi - phase - matching ( qpm ) reached via uv erasure @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the propagation of photons with oam in the usual step - index long optical fibers do not prevent cross - talk among modes with different oam from being strong , which results in the fast deterioration of the purity of the oam propagating modes .",
    "however , modern technology suggest also a solution in the form of ring and vortex fibers with ring - shaped cores @xcite that are more resistant against cross - talk . here",
    ", we show that entangled photon pairs in oam modes can be generated in this type of silica fiber with thermal poling .",
    "at the pump wavelength @xmath5 = @xmath6.,width=340 ]    the profile of the fiber with a ring - shaped core considered here is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "as the optical fields of guided modes are localized in the close vicinity of the core @xcite , the resulting radial symmetry considerably simplifies their determination via the maxwell equations . in a real fiber ,",
    "weak anisotropy occurs due to non - homogenity and stress in the material caused by two holes far away from the ring core that serve for poling wires @xcite .",
    "comparison of analytical results with the precise ones obtained by the full - vector mode solver from _ lumerical _ has revealed that the applied model is appropriate as long as the elements @xmath7 and @xmath8 of linear permittivity satisfy the condition @xmath9 .    in rotationally symmetric systems , the full electric ( @xmath10 ) and magnetic ( @xmath11 ) fields can be derived from their longitudinal components @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , they can be written as the product of a function that depends only on the azimuthal coordinate ( @xmath14 ) , and an another function that depends only on the radial coordinate ( @xmath15 ) , i.e. , @xmath12 , @xmath16 $ ] . functions @xmath17 and @xmath18 describe spatial profiles of fields along the radial and azimuthal directions , respectively .",
    "they satisfy the eigenvalue equations : @xmath19 f(r ) = 0 , \\hspace{1 cm }   { \\frac{\\mathrm{d } ^2 g(\\theta)}{\\mathrm{d } \\theta^2 } } + n^2 g(\\theta ) = 0 , \\label{eq:1}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the propagation constant ( eigenvalue ) of a guided mode with frequency @xmath21 ; @xmath22 denotes the velocity of light in the vacuum and @xmath23 means the relative dielectric permittivity .",
    "transverse profile of @xmath24 is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] . to simplify our calculations ,",
    "we consider @xmath23 only as a scalar - function .",
    "integer number @xmath25 counts eigenmodes that are solutions of the second equation in  ( [ eq:1 ] ) describing azimuthal properties of optical fields .",
    "these solutions have the form of harmonic functions with frequencies determined by @xmath25 . on the other hand , solutions of the first equation in  ( [ eq:1 ] ) for a fixed value @xmath25 are expressed in terms of the bessel functions . for fixed values of frequency @xmath26 and index @xmath27 , the continuity requirements on core boundaries admit only a discrete set of eigenmodes with suitable values of propagation constants @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "if we take into account field polarizations , we reveal the usual guided modes of optical fibers that are appropriate also for describing photon pairs .",
    "spatial modes characterized by an oam ( winding ) number @xmath29 are then obtained as suitable linear combinations of the above fiber eigenmodes @xmath30 classified by multi - index @xmath31 that includes azimuthal number @xmath25 , radial index of solutions of the first equation in  ( [ eq:1 ] ) and polarization .",
    "on quantum level , the nonlinear process of spdc converts a pump photon into a photon pair described by a first - order perturbation solution of the schrdinger equation with interaction nonlinear hamiltonian @xmath32 written in the radial coordinates as follows : @xmath33 in eq .",

    "symbol @xmath39 means the transverse area of the fiber of length @xmath40 .",
    "effectively induced nonlinear susceptibility @xmath41 has the following non - zero elements : @xmath42 and @xmath43 pm / v @xcite .",
    "we note that small variations in the @xmath44 profile across the core are effectively smoothed out by the nonlinear interaction [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq:6 ] ) below ] .",

    "the spdc process is pumped by a monochromatic beam of wavelength @xmath81 m .",
    "the fiber was designed such that photon pairs are emitted around the wavelength @xmath82 m used in fiber communication systems . a right - handed circularly",
    "polarized he@xmath83 mode with oam number @xmath84 ( composed of he@xmath85 and he@xmath86 modes , see @xcite ) has been found suitable for the pump beam .",
    "it gives minimal crosstalk with other pump modes ( namely tm@xmath87 ) at the given wavelength .",
    "importantly , according to the full - vector numerical model , the propagation constants of eigenmodes he@xmath85 and he@xmath86 for pump ( signal ) field differ only by 3.88@xmath88 ( 1.14@xmath88 ) rad / m in an anisotropic fiber with @xmath89 .",
    "the generated signal and idler photons fulfil the energy conservation law ( @xmath90 ) and also the selection rule for oam numbers ( @xmath91 ) that originates in the radial symmetry of the nonlinear interaction . under these conditions ,",
    "efficient photon - pair generation has been found for a signal photon in mode he@xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) and an idler photon in mode he@xmath94 or he@xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) which represent the right- and left - handed polarization variants of the same spatial mode . as the phase - matching curves in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) show , also other efficient combinations of signal and idler modes are possible , namely he@xmath97 te@xmath98 @xmath99he@xmath100 and he@xmath97 tm@xmath98 @xmath99 he@xmath100 .",
    "however , qpm reached via the periodic modulation of @xmath1 nonlinearity allows to separate different processes .",
    "the right choice of period @xmath101 of @xmath1 nonlinearity tunes the desired process that is exclusively selected provided that the @xmath102 spatial spectrum is sufficiently narrow . for our fiber ,",
    "the @xmath73 spatial spectrum has to be narrower than @xmath103 @xmath104m@xmath105 .",
    "this is achieved in general for fibers longer than 1  cm .",
    "the analyzed fiber 1  m long with the width of spatial spectrum equal to @xmath106 @xmath104m@xmath107 allows to separate the desired process from the other ones with the precision better than 1:100 .    according to fig .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) the greatest values of signal photon - number density @xmath108 occur for mode he@xmath92 with an oam number @xmath109 around the wavelength @xmath110 m .",
    "the full width at the half of maximum of the peak equals @xmath111  nm . the second largest contribution belongs to the processes involving modes he@xmath112 and he@xmath113 that interact with mode he@xmath114 .",
    "they build a common peak found at the wavelength @xmath115  @xmath104 m . in signal",
    "photon - number density @xmath116 , there also exists two peaks of mode he@xmath112 that form pairs with the peaks created by modes tm@xmath87 and te@xmath87 .",
    "these peaks are shifted towards lower and larger wavelengths , respectively , due to their propagation constants . whereas the peak belonging to mode tm@xmath98 occurs at the lower wavelength @xmath117  @xmath77 m , the peak given by mode te@xmath98",
    "is located at the longer wavelength @xmath118  @xmath119 m .",
    "spectral shifts of these peaks allow their efficient separation by frequency filtering . the generated photon - pair field is then left in the state with a signal photon in mode he@xmath92 and an idler photon either in state he@xmath94 or he@xmath120 . the weights of both possible idler states he@xmath94 and he@xmath120 in quantum superposition are the same which gives linear polarization of the overall idler field .",
    "also , pump - field leakage into modes te@xmath121 and tm@xmath121 caused by imperfect fiber coupling may occur .",
    "this gives extra peaks in the signal photon - number density @xmath122 that are spectrally separated from those discussed above by 15  nm .",
    "the fiber 1  m long provides around 240 photon pairs per 1  s and @xmath123w of pumping in the analyzed modes . for comparison ,",
    "the fibre 10-cm long generates around 20 photon pairs per 1  s and @xmath123w of pumping in the same configuration .",
    "this means that a slightly better than linear increase of photon - pair numbers with the fiber length occurs .",
    "strong correlations between the signal and idler frequencies result in fast temporal correlations between the signal and idler detection times occurring in a time window 7  ps long .",
    "we notice , that the process can also be considered in its left - handed polarization variant in which the pump beam propagates as a he@xmath124 mode .",
    "both variants provide photon pairs suitable , e.g. , for quantum metrology or heralded single - photon sources @xcite giving fock states with non - zero oam numbers .",
    "quasi - phase matching allows also other efficient combinations of modes .",
    "for example , the pump beam in mode he@xmath125 ( or he@xmath126 ) with @xmath127 provides spectrally broad - band spdc that may give photon pairs with temporal correlations at fs time - scale .",
    "also photon pairs entangled in oam numbers can be obtained in this configuration in which the signal ( idler ) photon propagates either as he@xmath128 ( he@xmath129 ) mode or he@xmath130 ( he@xmath131 ) .",
    "we note that vortex fibers @xcite are also suitable for spdc as they provide similar conditions for photon - pair generation as the analyzed ring fibers .",
    "moreover , their additional core gives better stability to fundamental modes participating in the nonlinear interaction .",
    "both ring and vortex fibers thus have a large potential to serve as versatile fiber sources of photon pairs in oam states useful in optical information processing .",
    "a ring fiber with thermally induced @xmath132 nonlinearity and periodical poling has been presented as a promising source of photon pairs being in eigenmodes of orbital angular momentum .",
    "spontaneous parametric down - conversion has been pumped by a beam with nonzero orbital angular momentum that has been transferred into one of the down - converted beams .",
    "several mutually competing nonlinear processes exploiting different modes can be spectrally separated .",
    "other configurations also allow for the emission of spectrally broad - band photon pairs as well as photon pairs entangled in orbital - angular - momentum numbers .",
    "this makes the analyzed ring fiber useful for many integrated fiber - based applications .",
