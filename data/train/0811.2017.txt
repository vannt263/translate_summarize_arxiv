    "entanglement is one of the most fascinating features of quantum mechanics and plays a central role in quantum information processing , such as quantum key distribution@xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite , dense coding @xcite , and so on . in the initial dense coding protocol @xcite",
    ", the sender can transmit two bits of classical information to the receiver by sending a single qubit if they share a two - qubit maximally entangled state ( an einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) state ) .",
    "since then , many works on dense coding have been presented experimentally @xcite or theoretically @xcite . we know",
    ", in a general dense coding , the sender performs one of the local unitary transformations @xmath0@xmath1 on @xmath2-dimensional quantum system to put the initially shared entangled state @xmath3 in @xmath4 with a priori probability @xmath5(@xmath6 ) , and then the sender sends off his quantum system to the receiver . upon receiving this quantum system ,",
    "the receiver performs a suitable measurement on @xmath7 to extract the signal .",
    "the optimal amount of information that can be conveyed is known to be bounded from by the holevo quantity@xcite : @xmath8 , where @xmath9 denotes the von neumann entropy and @xmath10 is the average density matrix of the signal ensemble . since the holevo quantity is asymptotically achievable@xcite , one can use @xmath8 as the definition of the capacity of dense coding .",
    "moreover , the von neumann entropy is invariant under unitary transformations , @xmath11 .",

    "the quantum entanglement in solid state systems such as spin chains has been an important emerging field since the founding of thermal entanglement @xcite .",
    "spin chains are natural candidates for the realization of the entanglement compared with other physical systems . as the thermal fluctuation is introduced into the system , the state of a typical solid - state system at thermal equilibrium ( temperature @xmath17 ) is @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the hamiltonian",

    "moreover , we can see with the increase of the @xmath55 , the area of @xmath17 that the optimal dense coding is feasible becomes wider . accordingly , for @xmath68 , we must have @xmath83 in order to make @xmath84 at some temperature .",

    "the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath90 are @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , with @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "as the thermal fluctuation is introduced into the system , in the standard basis @xmath98 , the state can be expressed as @xmath99 where @xmath100 , @xmath101 $ ] and @xmath102 .",
    "the entanglement of this model has been studied @xcite by means of concurrence . through eq.(3 ) and eq.(4 ) , we have also @xmath103.\\ ] ]    similarly , after a straight calculation , the value of the maximal dense coding capacity is given by @xmath104 - 2\\ln[\\eta])+\\zeta e^{\\frac{j}{t}}}{t\\eta\\ln[4]},\\ ] ] where @xmath105+\\delta\\sinh[\\delta/(2t)]]$ ] . in order to carry out the optimal dense coding successfully , the parameters of the model must satisfy @xmath106=1\\leftrightarrow \\zeta e^{\\frac{j}{t}}>2t\\eta\\ln[\\eta]$ ] , which can be returned to eq.(8 ) where @xmath80 for a vanishing dm interaction .",
    "we give a plot of optimal dense coding capacity as a function of dm interaction and spin coupling constant at a definite temperature in fig.4 .",
    "the variation of @xmath14 with @xmath107 is very similar to that of concurrence for the afm case .",
    "but for the fm case , the behavior of @xmath14 is different from that of concurrence .",
    "these results can be found by comparing fig.4 with fig.1 in ref .",
    "next , we consider the effects of dm interaction on dense coding capacity .",
    "case1 : dm interaction @xmath108 .",
    "the optimal dense coding capacity is always equal to @xmath109=2 $ ] for the afm and fm cases since the thermal is @xmath110 $ ] , which is a epr type state and its concurrence is 1 .",
    "case2 : for a finite dm interaction and temperature .",
    "the variation of @xmath14 with @xmath107 for @xmath66 and @xmath68 is plotted in fig.5 . as temperature increases ,",
    "the useful area of @xmath107 for optimal dense coding becomes narrow whether @xmath111 or @xmath112 .",
    "although there exists some @xmath107 for the thermal state that is not valid for optimal dense coding , for these @xmath107 the concurrence of the model is not zero .",
    "therefore , even though there is entanglement , it is unavailable for our optimal dense coding , which is the same as entanglement teleportation .",
    "comparing the left with the right , dm interaction must be stronger for fm in order to make @xmath84 at the same temperature for afm .",
    "moreover , @xmath113 , @xmath14 is always less than 2 for the fm case no matter what temperature is , which can be easily understood since the entanglement is zero . in fig.6 , the optimal dense coding capacity as a function of the temperature",
    "is plotted for different dm interactions .",
    "the critical value of @xmath17 when the thermal entangled states is valid for optimal dense coding ( @xmath84 ) for @xmath114 is larger than that for @xmath115 . at zero temperature , regardless of the dm interaction , @xmath60 for the afm because the state is @xmath116 , which is a epr type state . however , the thermal state is uncertain for the fm case at zero temperature . for nonzero @xmath107 ,",
    "the state is @xmath117 , so @xmath118 . at zero temperature ,",
    "@xmath119 because the state is @xmath120 $ ] , which is not an entangled state .",
    "in conclusion , we studied analytically the effects of two kinds of anisotropy on the optimal dense coding in the anisotropic _ xxz _ model and the heisenberg model with dm interaction .",
    "we demonstrated that whether the optimal dense coding is valid or not depends on both the anisotropic parameters and the sign of exchange constants @xmath28 .",
    "the conditions for a valid optimal dense coding have been given .",
    "for the afm _ xxz _ model , anisotropy must be larger than -1 and the critical temperature above which the optimal dense coding capacity @xmath121 will increase as anisotropy increases .",
    "but anisotropy must be less than 1 and the critical temperature will decrease with the increasing of anisotropy for the fm case .",
    "the dependence trends of optimal dense coding capacity on dm interaction are the same for both the afm and fm heisenberg model with dm interaction , and the relatively stronger dm interaction will be helpful for optimal dense coding .",
    "we also found that even though there is entanglement , it is unavailable for our optimal dense coding , which is the same as entanglement teleportation .",
