    "understanding coherent atom - light interactions in multi - level atomic media continues to be the focus of much attention , with an increasing variety of applications .",
    "phenomena such as electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit )  @xcite , coherent population trapping ( cpt )  @xcite , and four - wave mixing ( fwm ) have been instrumental in the development of atomic clocks  @xcite , magnetometers  @xcite , sub- and super - luminal propagation of light  @xcite , quantum memories  @xcite , photonic phase gates  @xcite , single - photon sources  @xcite , and squeezed states of light  @xcite .",
    "quantitative modeling for thermal ensembles remains difficult due to the complex atomic energy - level structure .",
    "in contrast , there has been much recent progress in quantitative modeling of linear systems both in terms of fundamental physics and applications @xcite . a recent experiment @xcite demonstrated that applying a large magnetic field can greatly simplify spectroscopic measurements , allowing the isolation of pure two - level systems even in hot atomic vapors where the doppler broadening is significantly larger than the natural linewidth . here",
    "we show this can be extended to two - photon excitation which , in a similar way , isolates pure three - level systems and thereby allows accurate modeling of eit spectra . as a demonstration we use this method to make the first direct measurement of the @xmath0 matrix element in @xmath1rb .",

    "the maximum field strength is 0.6  t and the maximum variation over the region occupied by the vapor cell ( shown in blue ) is less than 1  mt . ]        matrix elements for the alkali - metal atom @xmath4-lines are known to a very high precision by measuring fluorescence decay lifetimes @xcite .",
    "extending this technique to transitions between excited states is generally very difficult owing to the many possible decay channels . in most cases",
    "these matrix elements can be inferred by combining experimentally measured lifetimes with theoretically predicted branching ratios . however , in the case of @xmath4 states , properties such as lifetimes and branching ratios are more difficult to calculate accurately @xcite .",
    "direct experimental measurements of these matrix elements are therefore needed to support theoretical models .    in this article",
    "we study eit in the hyperfine paschen - back ( hpb ) regime , allowing us to isolate a pure three - level system in a hot atomic vapor of @xmath1rb .",
    "previous work on eit in large magnetic fields focused on @xmath5-eit  @xcite and cpt  @xcite and did not include quantitative analysis of the spectra .",
    "we extend this work by investigating a ladder system , which is of interest in for example , rydberg eit  @xcite and diamond four - wave mixing  @xcite . following the method of @xcite we conduct quantitative analysis of the eit spectra to determine rabi frequencies and extract the dipole matrix element .",
    "we find excellent agreement with an analytic three - level model for the spectra @xcite giving confidence in the reported matrix element .",
    "a schematic diagram of the experimental apparatus is shown in fig .  [",

    "we use a 2  mm long vapor cell , containing isotopically enriched @xmath1rb  ( @xmath62% @xmath7rb ) , which is heated to 70  @xmath8c to provide suitable optical depth on resonance .",
    "the cell also contains a buffer gas which leads to a lorentzian line broadening of @xmath97  mhz on the 5s@xmath105p transitions and @xmath920  mhz on the 5p@xmath105d transitions  @xcite . to generate the strong magnetic field needed to study the hpb regime we use a pair of permanent magnets separated by 15  mm . a cross sectional view is shown in fig .",

    "we measure the transmission of a weak  @xcite ( 20  nw ) probe laser at 780  nm as its frequency is scanned @xmath925  ghz around the rubidium @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) transition . a second ecdl at 776  nm provides a strong control field resonant with the @xmath13 transition which counter - propagates with the first .",
    "the beams are focused through the cell to @xmath14 radii of @xmath15 m for the probe beam and @xmath16 m for the control beam .",
    "the beam waists are chosen as a compromise between maximizing beam intensity , minimizing beam diffraction across the cell and ensuring that the probed atoms observe a uniform control - beam electric field profile .",

    "[ fig : brdiagram](b ) . to understand the probe transmission spectrum we first consider the effect of the strong magnetic field on the energy levels of the atoms .",

    "@xcite , where @xmath22 is the bohr magneton and @xmath23 is the ( axial ) magnetic field strength .    for @xmath1rb  ( @xmath24 ) in a 0.6  t magnetic field",
    "the zeeman shift is much larger than the hyperfine interaction energy .",
    "this leads to a decoupling of the spin - orbit and nuclear spin angular momenta which defines the hyperfine paschen - back regime @xcite . in the @xmath25 ground state",
    "the hyperfine structure is split into two groups of states with magnetic spin - orbit quantum numbers @xmath26 , each of which contain @xmath27 states with @xmath28 that are split by the hyperfine interaction energy . in the excited states @xmath29 ,",
    "the spin - orbit angular momentum , is larger so that both the number of states and the splitting of the stretched states increase .",
    "the hyperfine interaction energy is largest in the ground state where it is also larger than the doppler width .",
    "coupled with the transition selection rule @xmath30 this means that the probe field can address a single @xmath31 component of the @xmath25 to @xmath32 transition .    at 0.6  t",
    "the interaction of the ground state with the field is not large enough to completely decouple the spin - orbit and nuclear spin angular momenta . on the right hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig : brdiagram ] we write the @xmath25 eigenstates in the uncoupled basis , @xmath33 , which show clearly ( in blue ) the small fraction of residual hyperfine mixing .",
    "this small mixed fraction gives rise to the three weak transitions labeled 9 - 11 on fig .",
    "[ fig : brdiagram](b ) . these weak transitions and the dependence of their line strengths on magnetic field",
    "have been investigated in detail in  @xcite .    in our experiment",
    "the control field is resonant with the @xmath34 transition .",
    "this leads to doppler - free eit resonances on each of the lines labeled 1 - 4 and 9 - 11 as well as some narrow off - resonant two - photon absorption lines associated with probe absorption resonances labeled 5 - 8 . for clarity one of these two - photon absorption resonances",
    "is indicated by an additional arrow labeled 8a .",
    "crucially , all these two - photon resonances involve only 3 atomic states ; this is in contrast to the zero - field case when it is typically necessary to include large numbers of degenerate states to correctly model the response of the medium  @xcite .",
    "we now focus on a single absorption line and show , in fig .",
    "[ fig : single - fit ] , that we are able to accurately predict the observed eit line shapes with a simple three - level model .",
    "the electric susceptibility of a medium containing three level ladder - type atoms ( with axial velocity component @xmath35 ) exposed to a strong control field and a weak probe field is given by the formula  @xcite , @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39  is the dipole matrix element of the probe transition , @xmath40 is the vacuum permittivity , @xmath41 are the decay rates of the coherence on the probe and control transitions , @xmath42 are the probe and control detunings , @xmath43 are the probe and control wavenumbers , @xmath44 is the control transition rabi frequency and @xmath45 is the number density of @xmath1rb atoms . the absorption coefficient is then given by the integral of the imaginary component of the susceptibility over the maxwell - boltzmann distribution of atomic velocities @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the most probable speed , @xmath48 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath49 is the vapor temperature , and @xmath50 is the atomic mass .",

    "it is clear that the model is in excellent agreement with the data .",
    "however , there is some small but noticeable structure near to line center which is consistent with a small amount of electromagnetically induced absorption  @xcite caused by the back - reflected control light in the cell ( see appendix  [ eia ] ) .",
    "we point out that such good agreement is not obtained for the case of zero magnetic field where multiple overlapping resonances lead to a more complex line shape , the modeling of which is non - trivial .",

    "we must determine the control - beam electric field in the vicinity of the atoms .",
    "since the control - beam intensity changes significantly over the extent of the probe beam , we use a weighted average of the control - beam electric field profile ( @xmath66 ) weighted by the probe - beam intensity profile ( @xmath67 ) , i.e. @xmath68 we then determine the dipole moment of the driven transition ( between ground and excited states @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) through the equation : @xmath71 where the + 1 refers to the fact that the transition is a @xmath17 transition in which the final magnetic spin - orbit angular momentum @xmath72 . in a magnetic field of 0.60  t the states resonantly coupled by the control field",
    "can be decomposed in the @xmath73 basis as @xmath74 therefore , @xmath75 we now calculate the reduced matrix element using @xcite @xmath76 which is in excellent agreement with the theoretically calculated value of @xmath77  @xcite .",
    "further , we may determine the fully reduced dipole matrix element using @xcite @xmath78        .[tab : errors ] error budget of the @xmath56 dipole moment measurement .",
    "the second column shows the corrections we have made to account for the measured polarization impurity of the control field and for the measured reflectivity of the vapor cell windows . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in all cases the uncertainties are estimated by numerically modeling the modified line shapes and then performing a least - squares fit to the three - level eit model  @xcite .",
    "the following subsections provide details of these systematic changes to the eit line shape .",
    "the three - level eit line shape  @xcite implicitly assumes that every atom within the probe field experiences the same control - beam electric field . in practice",
    "this can be achieved by using specially engineered diffractive optics  @xcite to create top - hat shaped beams of light . for simplicity",
    "we take the alternate approach of expanding the control beam to approximately double the size of the probe beam .",
    "this approach leads to a lower peak rabi frequency but has the advantage that the beam profile does not change significantly on propagation through the medium .",
    "we estimate that making the assumption of constant control - beam intensity for our beams leads to a 0.4% overestimate of the matrix element .",
    "the vapor cell windows are uncoated and have a reflectivity of approximately 4% at each surface .",
    "the reflected light from the control beam overlaps with the interaction region and leads to weak electromagnetically induced absorption ( eia ) resonances .",
    "this effect has been investigated in detail  @xcite and its modifying effect on the eit line shape is well understood .",
    "figure  [ fig : eia ] shows the expected eia line shape assuming a 4% back reflection overlapping with 15% of the interaction region ( the cell is tilted to minimize this overlap ) .     predicted electromagnetically induced absorption ( eia ) line shape for a 4% back reflection of the control beam overlapping with 15% of the interaction region .",
    "the dashed line shows the fit to this line shape using a three - level eit line shape and the residual ( r ) shows the same structure as is found in the experimental data . ]",
    "the three - level eit formula [ eq .",
    "( [ equation : eit ] ) ] is fitted to the modified line shape and the residual shows the same structure that is found in the experimental data . although the effect on the line shape is quite noticeable , the effect on the extracted rabi frequency is small ( typically @xmath79% change ) and the impact on the measurement of the matrix element is even smaller due to the large range of control - beam powers used .",
    "if the vapor cell is not positioned exactly at the center of the magnetic field profile there will be a significant magnetic field gradient across the cell leading to an effective broadening of the lines . the effect on the line shape",
    "can be quite large so care is taken to ensure the cell is positioned correctly .",
    "the uncertainty in the positioning of the cell is @xmath80  mm which leads to a 0.1% overestimate of the matrix element .      in our experiment",
    "the probe - beam rabi frequency is 0.5  mhz which is significantly smaller than the linewidth of 6  mhz . as such there is very little power broadening of the spectral lines and the weak probe assumption  @xcite is very good .",
    "we estimate that this approximation leads to a 0.08% underestimate of the matrix element .",
    "the experimental spectra are frequency calibrated using an optical cavity with a free spectral range of 375  mhz and an atomic reference based on hyperfine pumping spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty in the calibration is approximately 0.1% which directly correlates with the uncertainty in the dipole matrix element .",
    "the presence of other nearby absorptive resonances can modify the eit line shape .",
    "specifically , the absorption in the wings of the line is increased relative to the line - center value .",
    "since the nearest absorptive resonances are @xmath81  ghz away , this effect is small and leads to a 0.2% underestimate of the matrix element .",
