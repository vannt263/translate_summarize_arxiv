    "there is recent observational evidence that the formation of massive stars ( early b - type to late o - type ) takes place in a way similar to that of solar - type objects , namely by accretion via a circumstellar disk : a handful of cases where a disk could be present around a forming massive star have been presented in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "this spectral type for the central star is in good agreement with that obtained from the dynamical considerations , as we will see in the next section .",

    ", we present the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for w3(oh)tw - a and -c . the spectrum of both objects shows a \" combined  two - regime spectrum , with one component observed at radio wavelengths with a negative / positive slowly rising spectrum ( with @xmath27 = @xmath80.5 for a and @xmath27 = 0.9 for b ) and that are related with synchrotron / thermal ? jets @xcite .",
    "the second component is observed at ( sub)millimeter wavelengths with the emission that rises rapidly with frequency , and is associated with optically thin dust emission from a circumstellar disk or maybe an envelope @xcite .",
    "we have obtained the spectral indices ( s@xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 ) for both structures from the millimeter and submillimeter bima+sma observations , see table 1 .",
    "the spectral indices are very steep ( 2.6 for the component a and 2.9 for the component b ) which are consistent with optically thin dust emission and with a dust mass opacity coefficient that varies with frequency as @xmath38 @xmath36 @xmath39 .",
    "this spectral index determination is reliable since the 0.89 , 1.4 , and 2.8 mm observations have similar angular resolution ( @xmath40 1@xmath11 ) and are in very good agreement with those values obtained at millimeter wavelengths by @xcite .    with this information",
    ", we can estimate the masses of the 890 @xmath4 m sources . adopting a value of @xmath41 = 1.5 @xmath42 g@xmath7 ( the average of the values of 1.0 @xmath42 g@xmath7 , valid for grains with thick dust mantles , and 2.0 @xmath42 g@xmath7 , valid for grains without mantles ) .",
    "this implies @xmath43 @xmath0 2.0 @xmath42 g@xmath7 .",
    "assuming optically thin , isothermal dust emission and a gas - to - dust ratio of 100 , and a dust temperature of 100 k for the ( sub)millimeter objects @xcite , we derive masses of about a few solar masses ( see table 1 ) .",
    "these values for the mass are in reasonable agreement with the values found by @xcite for w3(oh)tw - a equal to 5 m@xmath2 and for w3(oh)tw - c equal to 4 m@xmath2 .",
    "the differences would be attributed to the observations of @xcite probably are recovering more extended emission from the objects .    the dimensions ( @xmath0 1500 au ) , the masses ( of a few m@xmath2 ) , and that from both sources emanate at large scales powerful molecular outflows and at small scales thermal / non - thermal jets ( figure 1 ) suggest that w3(oh)tw - a and -c contain massive circumstellar disks .",
    "furthermore , the two submillimeter objects have orientations consistent with the ejection of the outflows ( table 1 ) .",
    "the derived masses and sizes of the two hypothesized disks ( table 1 ) will make fairly large optical depths of 0.3 in the dust emission .",
    "in such case , the spectral index may be affected by the optical depth and the assumption of optically thin dust emission might be not correct at all .",
    "there is , however , a problem with the interpretation of w3(oh)tw - a being a massive circumstellar disk .",
    "the orientation of the synchrotron jet and the h@xmath6o maser outflow that emanates from this source has an east - west orientation , and is not consistent with the orientation of the disk - like structure .",
    "however , as mentioned before , maybe w3(oh)tw - a is precessing or the putative disk is actually circumbinary , and one compact source in the middle drives the radio jet , and the second one the molecular outflow .        in our 2 ghz lower side band of the submillimeter observations , we detected the line ch@xmath5oh[(3 , 0)-4(2 , 2 ) ] v@xmath44=0,1 at a rest frequency of 337.135873 ghz .",
    "figure 3 shows maps of the intensity - weighted velocity ( moment 1 ) , overlaid with the 890 @xmath4 m continuum emission obtained by averaging the line - free channels in our sma observations .",
    "these maps reveal compact and strong submillimeter molecular emission arising only from the continuum sources and with clear velocity gradients of a few kilometers per second .",
    "w3(oh)tw - a shows a velocity gradient of about 8 km s@xmath7 arcsec@xmath7 at a position angle of @xmath835@xmath3 and w3(oh)tw - c of about 6 km s@xmath7 arcsec@xmath7 at a position angle of @xmath890@xmath3 . in figure 3 , we only present the strongest ch@xmath5oh emission from both sources , however , in figure 4 we show more clearly the full magnitude of the velocity gradients .",
    "the systemic velocities of each source are a bit different , we find that w3(oh)tw - a is at @xmath850.5 km s@xmath7 , while w3(oh)tw - c is at @xmath846.5 km s@xmath7 . assuming that the two sources are separated by @xmath45 and in a bound circular orbit",
    ", we estimate a lower limit of 30 m@xmath2 for the whole system .",
    "we note that the orientation of the velocity gradient found in these objects are in very good agreement with the position of the mayor axis of the circumstellar disk - like structures ( table 1 ) suggesting that we are likely seeing the rotation of the molecular gas in them .    in figure 4 , we show the kinematics of the molecular gas of both possible circumstellar disks . in the position - velocity diagrams it is much more clear to see the gradients and their magnitudes .",
    "the velocity gradients are clearly linear and associated with the rotation of a rigid body . however , to detect the keplerian motions , typically observed in many low - mass circumstellar disks , we need much more angular and spectral resolution .",
    "@xcite noted that the keplerian motions of the extremely large circumstellar disk associated with the massive young object w51 north are more pronounced close to the protostar while in the edges the molecular gas moves more like a rotating ring . assuming that the velocity gradients are keplerian",
    ", we find that the dynamical mass for w3(oh)tw - a is 16 m@xmath2 and for w3(oh)tw - c is 6 m@xmath2 .",
    "the sizes of the line emission are similar to those found in the dust continuum emission .",
    "those values are in good agreement with @xcite that reported a total dynamical mass for the system of about 22 m@xmath2 .",
    "however , we note that they could not separate the velocity gradient of each disk , they instead reported a single gradient across the system .",
