    "no other coexisting magnetic sublattices were detected .",
    "in addition , this system does not display lattice anomalies that might be associated with orbital ordering , or volumetric changes at @xmath75 due to an increase of the kinetic energy of @xmath76-electrons in the fm phase , as observed in fm manganites without ru - substitution .",
    "we note that the system studied here is not metallic and does not show an appreciable change in conductivity at the onset of the fm phase.@xcite    as a first step to rationalize the above observations , a discussion of the oxidation states of the mn and ru ions is worthwhile .",
    "two possibilities arise from the charge neutrality condition for the formula unit : ( i ) mn@xmath77ru@xmath16 , and ( ii ) mn@xmath78ru@xmath8 . based on our results , we argue against ( i ) . in fact , the large differences between mn@xmath79 and ru@xmath16 in either electrostatic charge ( @xmath80 ) and ionic radius ( 0.265 )@xcite would most likely lead to a chemically - ordered double perovskite structure.@xcite given the large differences between the nuclear neutron scattering factors of mn and ru ( with opposite signs , see section ii above ) , a significant volume fraction of such an ordered structure would be readly identified in our npd profiles , which was not the case ( see fig .",
    "[ profilelaca ] ) .",
    "even the presence of a significant volumetric fraction of short - range chemically ordered domains@xcite is not consistent with our measurements .",

    "[ bt7 ] . as a final argument against a significant presence of mn@xmath79/ru@xmath16 pairs , the expected average ( mn , ru)-o distance for this configuration is 2.10 ,@xcite much larger than the observed values , @xmath54   ( see table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "we note that the average ( mn , ru)-o distance expected for mn@xmath7/ru@xmath8 is 2.03 ,@xcite fairly close to the experimental values . the remaining discrepancy may be partly ascribed to a possible presence of a small fraction of mn@xmath8 or ru@xmath16 ions caused by off - stoichiometry effects ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "we should mention that superlattice bragg reflections indicative of a chemically - ordered double perovskite structure have been observed by electron diffraction for these same samples studied here.@xcite also , the crystal structure of la@xmath82sr@xmath83mn@xmath23ru@xmath23o@xmath3 was found to show a transition from random to ordered distribution of mn and ru ions at @xmath84.@xcite nonetheless , our npd results show that a chemically - ordered state is not representative of the bulk of the lcmr , lsmr , and lbmr samples studied in this work . a chemically - disordered perovskite phase for lsmr",
    "was also reported by horikubi _",
    "et al._@xcite    in view of the above , the la@xmath0mn@xmath1ru@xmath2o@xmath3 ( @xmath4 ca , sr , ba ) compounds may be described as a random distribution of mn@xmath7 and ru@xmath8 ions in the @xmath19-site of a perovskite structure .",
    "it is remarkable that a long - range fm state can survive to such a degree of random ru substitution at the mn site .",
    "we base our discussion upon a scenario proposed by martin _",
    "et al._@xcite to explain the rapid quenching of the orbital - ordered state and the development of a fmm phase in sm@xmath23ca@xmath23mno@xmath3 with relatively small levels of ru - substitution .",
    "according to this , the spatially - extended character of the ru @xmath85 orbitals would lead the @xmath86 states to participate to the band formation and contribute to make it broader , producing a fm coupling mechanism between mixed - valent mn and ru@xmath8 ions based upon an enhancement of the double exchange interaction .",
    "we note that a broadening of the @xmath11 band by mn / ru hybridization would lead to a fm coupling between mn and ru only if the @xmath11 band is partially filled , i.e. , the @xmath11 density of states must be finite at the fermi level . in the present case , our npd measurements suggest that the mn oxidation state is close to mn@xmath7 ( see discussion above ) , with one @xmath11 electron per mn ion . in this case",
    ", the likelyhood of @xmath11 charge carriers increases with the ratio of the @xmath11 bandwidth by the energy splitting .",
    "the presence of ru ions is believed to increase the @xmath11 bandwidth by mn / ru hybridization , and may decrease the jahn - teller splitting , since the local distortion of the mn@xmath7o@xmath20 octahedra might be smoothed out by the chemical disorder .",
    "it is therefore not unreasonable to assume the presence of a significant @xmath11 density of states at the fermi level in la@xmath0mn@xmath1ru@xmath2o@xmath3 ( @xmath4 ca , sr , ba ) .",
    "if this assumption is correct , the above carrier - mediated mechanism for the fm coupling may be valid . we should mention that transport measurements do not show metallic behavior below @xmath75 , although resistivity was found to be significantly low with a thermal behavior not characteristic of conventional semiconductors.@xcite in fact , a presumably small carrier density combined with the strong chemical disorder of this system would make a metallic state highly unlikely even in the fm phase , due to anderson localization .",
    "more direct investigations of the electronic structure of this system are required in order to confirm or dismiss the validity of the above scenario .",
    "notice that this is consistent with a previous report evidencing the presence of double exchange interactions in la@xmath87pb@xmath88mn@xmath89ru@xmath90o@xmath3 up to large levels of ru substitution ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "@xcite we should mention that a fm mn@xmath78ru@xmath8 superexchange interaction@xcite is possibly another important ingredient that may lead to the robust ferromagnetism found in la@xmath0mn@xmath1ru@xmath2o@xmath3 ( @xmath4 ca , sr , ba ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the same values of @xmath75 found for @xmath4ca and @xmath4ba ( see table [ table2 ] ) despite the large differences in the ( mn , ru)-o-(mn , ru ) superexchange angles ( see table [ table1 ] ) are intriguing , and suggest that superexchange alone is not sufficient to understand the magnetic properties of this system .",
    "the ordered moments found at low temperatures ( @xmath10/(mn , ru ) , see table [ table2 ] ) are significantly lower than the @xmath92/(mn , ru ) expected for a fm arrangement of high - spin mn@xmath7 ( @xmath93 ) and low - spin ru@xmath8 ( @xmath94 ) moments in a spin - only atomistic picture .",
    "we first note that the ru @xmath85 states are highly hybridized with o @xmath95 , which may reduce the ru moments .",
    "we mention that srruo@xmath3 and sr@xmath96ru@xmath3o@xmath97 are metallic ferromagnets with saturated magnetic moments well below @xmath94/ru@xmath8.@xcite secondly , the random distribution of mn and ru ions in the lattice might lead to some sites with frustrated exchange interactions in the fm lattice , leading to local spin reversal and/or loss of spin collinearity . a combination of the two effects above may lead to the reduced fm moments observed by npd .    in transition - metal compounds with a significant density of degenerate",
    "@xmath98 and @xmath11 orbitals , strong tendencies for orbital - ordering ( oo ) have been identified.@xcite the spin states associated with oo are generally antiferromagnetic , therefore oo and ferromagnetism ( satisfying double - exchange interactions ) tend to be competing ground states .",
    "such a competition is believed to be a decisive ingredient leading to the rich phase diagram observed in manganites , in addition to tendencies for charge ordering for specific concentrations of @xmath11 electrons , which also favors oo . in the present case , the fm coupling is believed to arise from hybridization between mn@xmath7 and ru@xmath8 @xmath11 states , leading to a presumably small but significant carrier density in the @xmath11 band .",
    "one might suspect that tendencies for oo should overcome the fm coupling in la@xmath0mn@xmath1ru@xmath2o@xmath3 ( @xmath4 ca , sr , ba ) , since both mn@xmath7 and ru@xmath8 ions show degenerate @xmath76 orbitals .",
    "however , the fm ground state actually observed in this system , with no cooperative distortions of the ( mn , ru)o@xmath20 octahedra ( see table [ table1 ] ) and/or lattice anomalies that might be associated with oo ( see figs . [ lattpar ] and [ bonds ] ) , contradicts such an expectation , indicating that ru - substitution actually inhibits oo .",
    "in fact , previous studies indicate that even a light ru substitution quenches orbitally - ordered states in half - doped manganites.@xcite the most likely explanation for this tendency stems from the spatially - extended character of the ru @xmath85 states : the mn@xmath7 @xmath11 orbitals would have a tendency to point along the neighboring ru ions , in order to take full advantage of the strong mn - ru hybridization.@xcite notice that each mn@xmath7 ion has two mn / ru neighbors along each binding direction .",
    "thus , each mn@xmath7 @xmath11 orbital would point to the direction with most ru ions .",
    "this effect may freeze the orbital degree of freedom of mn@xmath7 @xmath11 and possibly ru@xmath8 @xmath98 electrons . in a crystal structure with a random distribution of ru and mn ions ( see section iii ) ,",
    "long - range oo would be prevented , leading to an orbital glass state .    in conclusion ,",
    "our npd results on la@xmath0mn@xmath1ru@xmath2o@xmath3 ( @xmath4 ca , sr , ba ) show a perovskite crystal structure with no chemical ordering of mn@xmath7 and ru@xmath8 ions .",
    "no evidence of long - range orbital ordering was observed , possibly due to a freezing of the orbital degree of freedom caused by a significant mn - ru hybridization . a long - range fm spin structure was observed .",
    "this result was ascribed to the spatially - extended character of ru @xmath85 levels , contributing to broaden the @xmath11 band and leading to the presence of a small but finite density of @xmath11 states at the fermi level .",
    "such states may lead to carrier - mediated fm coupling . in this context , the non - metallic conductivity observed in this system@xcite was ascribed to anderson localization caused by the large ru / mn chemical disorder .",
