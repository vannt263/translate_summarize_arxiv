    "lkh@xmath0234 ( m@xmath2=11.9mag ) is a star embedded in a nebula associated with the ngc 7129 star forming region and is at a distance of about 1250 parsecs .",
    "this is one of the youngest known herbig be objects and has an age @xmath1 0.1 million years and spectral type of b5 ( fuente et al .",
    "2001 ) . herbig",
    "ae / be stars are intermediate mass ( 2 to 10m@xmath3 ) pre - main - sequence stars ( herbig 1960 ) .",
    "a number of herbig ae stars have been found to possess circumstellar disks and show both photometric and spectroscopic variability ( herbst et al . 1999 ) .",
    "lkh@xmath0234 though much hotter and more massive also exhibits these properties ( fuente et al .",
    "2001 , herbst et al . 1999 ,",
    "polomski et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the star shows photometric variability of 1.2 magnitude in the v band and is known posses a circumstellar disk with the disk mass to the stellar mass ratio ( m@xmath4/m@xmath5 ) @xmath6 0.02",
    ". a detailed description of lkh@xmath0234 and its circumstellar region can be found in fuente et al .",
    "( 2001 , and references therein ) .",
    "spectroscopic variations in metallic lines ( like na i , ca ii , etc . ) in young a type stars like @xmath7 pictoris ( 20 to 100 million years ) are often interpreted as the signature of star grazing comets or falling evaporating bodies with sizes of tens of kilometers ( grinin et al .",
    "1996 , smith & terrile 1984 , thebault & beust 2001 ) .",
    "the only herbig be star where grazing cometary transient events have been inferred so far is hd 100546 ( viera et al .",
    "however , hd100546 is much older ( @xmath810 myrs ) and cooler ( spectral type @xmath1b9 ) compared to lkh@xmath0234 .",
    "high resolution spectroscopic monitoring of very young ( 0.1 to 1 myrs ) herbig be stars are scanty and uncharted .    here",
    "we report dramatic variations in the spectroscopic lines of na i 5890(d2 ) , and 5896(d1 ) , he i 5876 , and h@xmath0 of lkh@xmath0234 over a period of 31 days during oct .- nov .",
    "the observations consists of high resolution spectra ( r=30,000 ) from the hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) using the high resolution spectrograph ( hrs ) .",
    "section 2 describes observations and in section 3 we discuss the results and section 4 gives the conclusion .",
    "we have obtained high signal to noise ratio and high resolution spectra ( r=30,000 , @xmath10.2 ) of lkha234 covering he i 5876 , na i d2 & d1 lines and the balmer h@xmath0 at 6563 .",
    "the observations were taken with the 9.2 m hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) ( ramsey et al . 1998 ) using its high resolution spectrograph ( hrs ) ( tull 1998 ) .",
    "the echelle spectral orders were optimized to cover the wavelength range between 5700 to 6750 .",
    "this allowed the spectral lines of interest to be recorded by the ",
    "blue \" ccd of the spectrograph that has fewer number of bad pixels than the  red \" ccd .",
    "the results comprise of five data sets over a time period of 31 days .",
    "the observation dates were : 7th , 13th , 23rd , 27th october and 8th november 2003 . on each night of observation , three ten minutes exposures on lkh@xmath0234 were taken which were combined to get high signal to noise ratio ( s / n = 70 to 100 ) .",
    "all data were reduced using standard iraf routines under echelle tasks . every spectrum was bias subtracted , and flat - fielded .",
    "spectral calibrations were done using thorium - argon lamp spectra taken either immediately before or after the observations .",
    "we found that the wavelength calibration is accurate up to 0.05 .",
    "h@xmath0 ( 6563 ) , he i 5876 , and na i d2 & d1 spectral lines are shown in figures 1 and 2 respectively and the dates of observations are noted along side of the spectra .",
    "the x - axis is in terms of relative velocity ( km / s ) with respect to the center of the lines in the stellar rest frame and the y - axis shows line intensities normalized with respect to the stellar continuum . in figure 2",
    "the zero of the relative velocity scale is with respect to the stellar rest frame of the sodium d2 line .",
    "we illustrate in figure 1 the variability in h@xmath0 and he i lines .",
    "these are seen as stellar photospheric absorption lines in the spectra observed on 7th oct .",
    "however , in all the later days of observations the h@xmath0 appeared to be in emission consisting of two components , the red shifted emission component ( rec ) , and the blue shifted emission component ( bec ) .",
    "the h@xmath0 equivalent width varied from + 3(on 7th oct . ) to -50(13th oct . ) in just 6 days and it continued to rise up to -100(27th oct . ) before it decayed to -74(8th nov . ) .",
    "the relative velocity between the rec and bec varied between 150 km / s to 225 km / s with the rec stronger than the bec by a factor of 2.5 to 3.5 .",
    "the spectra obtained on 7th oct .",
    "2003 do not show any sign of emission or activity in h@xmath0 or he i. this observation shows the star in a quiescent state , with neither accretion nor stellar wind affecting the absorption line profile .",
    "the variations in the he i line are found to correlate with the variations in the h@xmath0 . whenever the h@xmath0 bec and rec are stronger the he i either fills up due to mild emission or shows a very large absorption width ( almost 1.7 times the photospheric line width ) .",
    "the line width varied from 150 km / s to 260 km / s .",
    "a b5 star does not have sufficiently energetic photons to ionize he i ( jaschek & jaschek 1995 ) , so the filling up of the he i absorption line due to mild emission is an indicator of accretion phenomena ( de winter et al .",
    "we find the disk luminosity to be about 1@xmath9 of the stellar luminosity ( l@xmath1010@xmath11l@xmath3 ) with maximum disk temperature of @xmath121000k , if we consider an accretion rate of 10@xmath12m@xmath3 per year ( natta et al .",
    ".    therefore , the double peak h@xmath0 ( rec & bec ) profiles and the he i mild emission are because of orbiting accreting gas on to the star and as well as outflow of circumstellar gas ( bec in h@xmath0 due to accretion heat ) . however ,",
    "when the accretion luminosity is not strong enough to produce enough ionizing photons , the he i line appears as a very broad absorption feature .",
    "the broad absorption feature is the effect of the combination of the stellar photospheric line and various unresolved circumstellar gas components corresponding to rec and bec of h@xmath0 .",
    "the effect of gaseous accretion are probably also seen on the nebular emission lines .",
    "we found a correlation between the total equivalent width in h@xmath0 and the peak nebular emission in h@xmath0 and na i. figures 1 & 2 show that the nebular h@xmath0 and na i lines were of minimal intensity ( @xmath11.06 above the continuum ) on 7th oct .",
    "the same lines are strongest ( h@xmath0 @xmath17.9 , on the blue wing of the rec , and na i d2 line @xmath13.0 ) on 27th oct . when the h@xmath0 equivalent width is maximum ( -100 ) .",
    "we plan to model the impact of the episodic accretion on the nebula using a photo - ionizing code ( for eg .",
    "the cloudy code ) which will be published along with the entire spectra of lkh@xmath0234 elsewhere in the near future .",
    "figure 2 shows the variability in the na i d2 and d1 lines . redshifted absorption components ( rac ) were observed in na i lines on only one night ( 13 oct . 2003 ) with a maximum redshifted velocity of 200 km / s .",
    "the rac s associated with both the na i lines are of similar depth ( for redshifts @xmath6 100km / s ) which is an indicator of saturation ( unshielded na i column density = 10@xmath13/@xmath14)(de winter et al .",
    "1999 ) . however , the maximum depth of these components is about 30% of the stellar continuum implying partial coverage of the stellar photosphere .",
    "in addition to na i rac , very mild bec ( 60 to 100 km / s and 1.05 to 1.07 above the continuum ) are also seen on the 13th oct .",
    "the variations in he i and h@xmath0 are observed even when no na i rac & bec are seen ( see figures 1 & 2 ) .",
    "thus the appearance and disappearance of the na i rac & bec are uncorrelated with the variations in h@xmath0 and he i line profiles .",
    "we conclude that we witnessed a transient phenomenon on 13th oct .",
    "2003 whose effects lasted a few days at most .",
    "from the keplerian dynamics of an infalling object ( beust et al .",
    "2001 ) the most redshifted na i absorption component velocity ( 200 km / s ) should correspond to a distance of 0.1 au from the star . at this distance both",
    "the number of ionizing photons and intensity of the stellar wind will be too high for any unshielded na i to survive ( sorelli et al .",
    "their calculations using photo - ionizing codes under local thermodynamical equilibrium ( lte ) and non - lte show that only a solid body like a comet or asteroid can approach a hot star this close before it disintegrates and evaporates .",
    "further , theoretical model calculations for stars up to b9 show that the size of solid bodies which are able to survive up to a distance of 0.1 au should be at least 100 km in diameter ( beust et al .",
    "the mild na i bec could then be part of the falling evaporating body being blown away by the stellar wind or radiation pressure .",
    "however , this will also mean that the falling solid body may have a high eccentric orbit so that the blown away material is not projected against the stellar surface .",
    "our na i rac and bec observations are consistent with such an object dissociating between 2 au and 0.1 au from the b5 star lkh@xmath0234 .",
    "in many herbig ae stars , variations in na i racs and bac s usually correlates with h@xmath0 and he i variations ( de winter et al .",
    "1999 , grinin et al .",
    "such na i variations are now thought to be generated by magneto - hydrodynamic funnelling of neutral gas on to the star rather than solid body infall ( beust et al .",
    "2001 , mora et al .",
    "2002 , natta et al .",
    "no such correlation is present in the current lkh@xmath0234 data set .",
    "of particular significance is the observation on 27th oct .",
    "2003 when the rec and bec of h@xmath0 are the strongest .",
    "the absence of any na i rac and bec in this observation is a strong argument against the na i line variations being caused by neutral matter funnelled onto the star by magnetic fields .",
    "the variability of h@xmath0 and he i in lkh@xmath0234 are due to episodic gas accretion , while the observed variations in na i lines is a transient event that exhibits the dynamical signature of a body ( @xmath8100 km in diameter ) falling onto the star .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that recent studies on meteors from cometary origin by trigo - rodriguez et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have shown greater sodium abundances than those expected for inter - planetary dust particles and chondritic meteorites and potter et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have detected comet like sodium tail from planet mercury , and also the discovery of presence of sodium tail in comets ( cremonese et al .",
    "thus an infalling solid body of asteroid size and deficient in h can produce the observed na i rac and bec and no correlation with the h and he i lines .    the dusty circumstellar disk of the young star lkh@xmath0234 could be a newly formed protoplanetary disk consisting of solid bodies of different sizes ( fuente et al .",
    "theoretical models of formation of planetary bodies in circumstellar disks around a 1m@xmath3 mass star show that planetesimals of sizes of up to a few hundred kilometers can quickly form within the first 10@xmath15 years and the typical cumulative number of such bodies can be 10@xmath16 to 10@xmath17 between 0.5 to 1.5 au from the star ( lissauer 1993 , weidenschilling et al .",
    "1997 ) . while such numbers are not known for b type stars , lkh@xmath0234 ( age @xmath1 0.1 myrs ) may have high frequency of infall events ( grady et al . 2000 )",
    "we have presented here high resolution spectroscopic monitoring of a herbig be star lkh@xmath0234 in the na i ( d2&d1 ) , he i ( 5876 ) and h@xmath0 lines .",
    "we found no correlations between the na i and the he i and h@xmath0 line variability in the five data sets over a period of 31 days ( 7th oct .",
    "2003 to 8th nov . 2003 ) though we do find a correlation between he i and h@xmath0 .",
    "thus the origin of variation in the na i line ( rac up to 200 km / s and bec up to 100 km / s seen only on 13th oct .",
    "2003 ) is different from those of h@xmath0 and he i. while the h@xmath0 and he i line variations are due to episodic gaseous accretion , the na i rac indicate a dramatic transient event of solid body infall on to the star and the bec as the blown away parts of the solid body not projected against the stellar surface . considering the keplerian dynamics and the harsh environment of a b5 star",
    ", we estimate that a solid body of size @xmath8100 km broke up and disintegrated at a distance between 0.1 to 2.0 au from the star .",
    "this makes lkh@xmath0234 the youngest system ( @xmath10.1 myrs ) with evidence for protoplanetary bodies of asteroidal size .",
    "we plan to pursue further spectroscopic monitoring of the star with the het to determine the frequency of such events and further understand the complicated dynamics of this very young circumstellar environment .",

    "the authors would also like to thank the referee mike sitko for very valuable suggestions which made the content of the paper strong .",
