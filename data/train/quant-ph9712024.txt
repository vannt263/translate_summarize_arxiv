    "the complexity of the spectrum of has always been a challenge , both to experimentalists and theorists .",
    "well - resolved spectra were first measured only after the advent of the laser , and the introduction of cooled molecular beams allowed the measurement of _ complete _ spectra in certain energy ranges ( still not up to the dissociation limit ) @xcite .",
    "one reason for the spectral congestion is the conical intersection ( found by gillespie _",
    "et al . _ in 1975 @xcite ) mixing the @xmath2 electronic ground state surface at an energy of only 1.289 ev with the first excited @xmath3 surface .",
    "the dissociation energy v@xmath4 of @xmath2 is 3.226 ev . in the experiment",
    ", this leads to disturbed progressions and increased state density , while the theorist is forced to include the vibronic coupling in the calculation of more than the lowest few vibrational states of the molecule @xcite .",
    "there are only a few molecules for which anything like a full list of vibrational states ( even for j = 0 ) has been calculated .",
    "examples are the pioneering work of tennyson et al.@xcite on h@xmath5 , and the more recent calculations on ho@xmath6@xcite , hcn@xcite , h@xmath5@xcite and @xcite .",
    "the reason for this situation is , of course , the immense computational expense of such calculations , which one generally applies only to potential energy surfaces ( pes ) which are quite well known .",
    "these , however , are still scarce .",
    "in this paper we present first results of an effort to compute bound and resonance states of .",
    "two developments were of great help to us : first the calculation of good pess for the two lowest electronic states of including their coupling by the siena - wuppertal group @xcite ; second , the advent of the filter diagonalization method @xcite for solving large eigenvalue problems .",
    "the first step of this endavour , which we report here , is the calculation of all ( @xmath73000 ) adiabatic bound states of the ground pes .",
    "this in itself is non - trivial , since near the dissociation limit the average state density is @xmath70.2 states per for each of the two symmetry species .",
    "the computation of non - adiabatic energy eigenvalues , which includes the surface coupling , is under way@xcite , and the method itself allows the introduction of imaginary absorption potentials , and , therefore , the extension of the calculations to resonances .",
    "( this has been tested for h@xmath5@xcite )    another benefit of this project is the possibility to perform a thorough statistical analysis over the whole energy range of a molecular system .",
    "this has so far been almost impossible for real molecules , because of missing data in the experiments , or an insufficient number of eigenstates in the calculation , both leading to large statistical errors@xcite .    in the following",
    "we discuss first some properties and necessary modifications to the pes of ref.@xcite , then the computation , and , finally , some results on the statistics of the computed levels .",
    "since the two lowest adiabatic pess of have a conical intersection at an energy of about one third of the dissociation energy , they must both be considered in any calculation of more than the lowest few vibrational states @xcite .",
    "however , the intersection makes their direct interpolation impractical . instead , one interpolates the diabatic surfaces v@xmath8 and v@xmath9 , and , in addition , their coupling v@xmath10 . from",
    "such fits one computes the energies of the two adiabatic surfaces v@xmath11 ( ground state ) and v@xmath12 ( first excited state ) whenever they are needed from @xmath13 the surfaces used in our calculations have been derived in several steps from nearly 1000 _ ab initio _ points computed in ref.@xcite .",
    "these points have been diabatized @xcite by a unitary transform , demanding that certain dipole matrix elements be small .",
    "all computed points are in the region ( here we use bond coordinates ) @xmath14 , called region d in ref.@xcite . to produce surfaces useful for the calculation of vibrational levels , they had to be fitted to an analytical form , furthermore they had to be extrapolated to regions outside of region d , i.e. to shorter and larger interatomic distances , and to small angles .",
    "this has been done in several iterations by the siena and wuppertal groups @xcite , who also utilized empirical data from the measured spectrum ( see ref.[1 ] in @xcite ) to improve the final fits of ref.@xcite .",
    "it is these fits , called here v@xmath15 ( for leonardi - petrongolo ) from which we started .    while the authors of ref.@xcite had no problems to compute vibrational energies with their fits , early test calculations with our method showed that the short- and long - range extrapolations in v@xmath15 have ( unphysical ) kinks , which can not be tolerated when a discrete variable representation ( dvr ) is used .",
    "therefore , we modified the surfaces by smoothing out the kinks as described below .",
    "preliminary calculations done by c. petrongolo @xcite with this surface using the code from ref .",
    "@xcite , and our nonadiabatic computation@xcite show an equally good agreement with experimental data at energies up to 1.22 ev .",
    "additionally , our surface modification improves the computed state density up to 2.3 ev , which had been too high compared with the experimental one in ref.@xcite .    in detail , the following modifications were applied ( energies are hartree units = 27.211396 ev , distances bohr units @xmath16 = 0.529177@xmath17 m ) : + * ( a ) * the short - range correction ( for @xmath18 ) of the lower diabatic surface @xmath19 was changed to ( shown only for @xmath20 , but similar for @xmath21 ) : @xmath22 here the function @xmath23 is the incomplete gamma function cf .",
    "@xcite ) and the parameters a and b are listed in table [ switchdata ] . + * ( b ) * the short - range correction to v@xmath9 was dropped , and v@xmath24 set to a finite high value v@xmath25 for @xmath26 , and similarly for @xmath27 .",
    "+ * ( c ) * the small angle ( @xmath28 ) corrections to the potentials v@xmath8 and v@xmath9 were dropped completely .",
    "+ * ( d ) * for small and large angles ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) the coupling potential was smoothly set to zero : @xmath30 the values used for the parameters a and b are listed in table [ switchdata ] . + * ( e ) * the long - range correction of the diagonal potentials v@xmath31 , which are necessary to produce the correct dissociation limits , where modified by changing the switching function , now reading ( for @xmath32 ) @xmath33 and similar for @xmath21 .",
    "the parameters a and b are again listed in table [ switchdata ] .",
    "for computing bound states of we use the low - storage version of the filter - diagonalization method introduced recently by mandelshtam and taylor @xcite .",
    "this method is conceptually based on the filter - diagonalization procedure of wall and neuhauser @xcite which extracts the system eigenenergies by harmonic inversion of a time correlation function c(t ) .",
    "the method of ref .",
    "@xcite is designed for a direct harmonic inversion of the chebyshev correlation function @xcite @xmath34 for the eigenenergies @xmath35 and amplitudes @xmath36 .",
    "the computation of the @xmath37 sequence is done to essentially the machine precision using a very inexpensive iterative numerical scheme , @xmath38 with @xmath37 being generated using @xmath39 .",
    "this requires to store only a few vectors at a time , assuming that the matrix - vector multiplication is implemented without explicit storage of the hamiltonian matrix .",
    "the spectral analysis part ( i.e. , the harmonic inversion of @xmath37 by the filter - diagonalization ) is carried out independently and computationally very efficiently after the sequence @xmath37 is computed .",
    "all these features assure the very high performance of the overall numerical procedure .    for the hamiltonian matrix representation we choose radau coordinates ( @xmath40 ) in which all mixed derivatives in the kinetic energy vanish @xcite , to account for the c@xmath41 symmetry of the molecule .",
    "the fast application of the hamiltonian matrix to a vector is achieved by implementing a potential adapted dvr , which we set up in a way which allowed us to identify a single parameter , the potential cutoff energy @xmath42 , on which all other grid parameters depend .",
    "the bases for the radial parts of the hamiltonian are sinc - dvrs@xcite , characterized by their spatial extensions @xmath43 to @xmath44 ( i = 1 , 2 ) , and sizes @xmath45 , which are diagonalized and then truncated by an energy cutoff to @xmath46 . for the angular part we use a legendre - dvr@xcite characterized by its size @xmath47 .",
    "the angular extension is always 0to 180 .",
    "convergence studies in which all grid parameters are varied independently are prohibited in this study by the computing times involved . instead ,",
    "these parameters were fixed in 1d calculations , but in a consistent way : we first set an accuracy goal , in this case a relative accuracy of @xmath0 for states just below the true dissociation energy of 3.226 ev . with this desired accuracy",
    "we adjust ( in 1d calculations at the equilibrium angle @xmath48 ) the spatial extensions @xmath43 to @xmath44 ( i = 1 , 2 ) of the radial grids , while the sizes @xmath49 are kept very large .",
    "then the sizes of the spatial grids , @xmath50 , are adjusted to yield this same desired accuracy , similarly for the angular grid ( at @xmath51 ) , whose extension , 0 to 180 , is kept .",
    "the equidistant grid spacings of the 1d - dvr points @xmath52 , on the other hand , determine a maximum kinetic energy , @xmath53 ( we used @xmath54 and @xmath55 as an estimate for the moment of inertia in eq .",
    "[ tang ] , which seems reasonable for an almost dissociating wavepacket . )",
    "the larger one of these kinetic energies , which in our example ( @xmath0 relative accuracy at 3.226 ev ) are 4.5 ev for the radial grids and 8.0 ev for the angular grid , is then used to fix the potential cutoff @xmath42 . for consistency ,",
    "the radial grids are increased in size such that t@xmath56 .",
    "then all dvr - points for which v(@xmath57 are deleted . as a final result for the accuracy goal mentioned above we get a primitive grid of @xmath50 = 127 , @xmath58 , a 1d truncation of the radial grids to @xmath59 = 100 , and a final truncated grid of 1 112 707 points .",
    "a further parameter of the method is the number of iterations of the filter diagonalization , eq .",
    "[ eq : cheb ] , which is one half of the number of chebyshev coefficients @xmath37 .",
    "in addition , for the final stage of the calculation the window parameters @xmath60 , and the number of window basis functions ( described in ref.@xcite ) have to be fixed .",
    "this was done such that the extracted eigenenergies were converged to 6 figures with respect to the sequence of coefficients @xmath37 , i.e. two orders of magnitude better than our overall accuracy goal .",
    "this led to a number of 300  000 coefficients , whose calculation for the 8 ev set of one symmetry needed about 30 days of cpu - time on an ibm rs6000/59h .    to ensure that our overall accuracy is in the exponential convergence region , and not in some  misleading",
    " small local convergence minimum @xcite , we ran four different grids consistent with energy cutoffs of 4 , 6 , 8 and 8.1 ev .",
    "the last one has been used in comparison to the last but one to observe numerical noise , and to have an independent set of eigenvalues ensuring that we do not miss any levels .",
    "all inconsistencies between the two largest sets have been cleared .",
    "the errors of the computed eigenvalues can be approximately taken as the noisy difference between the calculation with @xmath42 = 8.0 ev and the one with @xmath42 = 8.1 ev . as fig .",
    "[ converg ] shows , it increases with energy above about 2 ev , and above 3 ev has a plateau of about @xmath0 ev .",
    "this plateau , which is also shown by the differences of the smaller calculations ( with @xmath42 = 4.0 and 6.0 ev , respectively ) , is caused by the common limited spatial extension of the radial basis sets , which do not cover the tails of the high energy wavefunctions exceeding @xmath44 .",
    "due to a smaller density of dvr points in these bases , their plateau starts earlier than that of @xmath42 = 8.0 ev .",
    "apart from that , the errors of the smaller calculations lie in the expected order",
    ". results for the odd states are similar .",
    "the fact , that all errors lie below the desired precision , proves the convergence of the 3d computation .",
    "our result consists of the energies of 1606 even and 1361 odd levels of @xcite .",
    "( note that the symmetries of this adiabatic calculation have no physical meaning for the true non - adiabatic molecule with its dominant conical intersection ) . at energies below 10  000they agree with the published list of experimental values@xcite to within an average error of 14 .",
    "since in that energy region the potential fit has been adjusted using the experimental data , this shows the correctness of our calculation in this energy range .",
    "similar agreement exists between our computed data and those computed in ref.@xcite .",
    "at much higher energies a comparison with experimental data is questionable due to the inaccuracies of the extrapolated pess , which we had to use , and the adiabatic approximation .",
    "however , statistical analyses are meaningful .",
    "so , we have performed separate statistical analyses of the 1606 even and 1361 odd levels .",
    "one expects a transition from regular to irregular dynamics with rising energy not later than the conical intersection at 1.289 ev . since only about 75 even and",
    "50 odd states lie below this energy , nearest neighbor histograms trying to show this effect , suffer from insufficient data . nevertheless , in fig .",
    "[ nearneigh ] the nearest neighbor distributions of the even states are shown for four different energy windows covering all parts of the spectrum .",
    "all distributions imply chaotic dynamics by their wigner type shape , but only the two high energy distributions contain enough data to be really trustworthy .",
    "one may , perhaps , wonder why the adiabatic , uncoupled , ground state pes of shows `` chaos '' at such a low energy .",
    "however , one should not forget that ( a ) any anharmonic pes shows chaos gradually increasing with energy , and ( b ) that the low - lying conical intersection in _ indirectly _ distorts the shape of the _ adiabatic _ surfaces very much compared with , e.g. , a triple morse potential .",
    "the contribution of the born - oppenheimer breakdown , i.e. the _ direct _ coupling between the surfaces as such , does not change the level statistics too much@xcite .",
    "the rigidity of the spectrum , @xmath61 seems to be more robust .",
    "it is defined as the local mean square deviation of the level staircase n(e ) from the best fitting straight line over an energy range @xmath62 $ ] corresponding to l mean level spacings , namely @xmath63 ^ 2 de \\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we have calculated it for lengths l between 2 and 300 levels for the whole spectrum , and for several fractions of it .",
    "we have also used various unfolding procedures @xcite ( and no unfolding at all , which has no effect at energies above 2.3 ev ) .",
    "we find no energy range in which @xmath61 is near l/15 , the expectation value for random level positions , which one generally correlates with regular classical dynamics . instead ,",
    "taking the usual values of l from 2 to 30 , we find @xmath61 slightly above the expectation for a gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) , but never higher than twice that value .",
    "interestingly , when we looked for the fluctuations at a much wider scale , taking l between 100 and 300 , we found an energy dependent behavior , which , in addition , differed for the even and odd states .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ delta3 ] . for l = 100 ,",
    "the expected values for random and goe sequences are 6.67 and 0.46 , respectively .",
    "our results lie between 0.5 and 2.5 in different parts of the spectrum .",
    "they are robust against a variation of l between 100 and 300 , and against random shifts of the energy levels of up to 0.5% , simulating errors in the diagonalization procedure . to demonstrate that fig .",
    "[ delta3 ] indeed shows the developement of the dynamical structure of the states with energy , we show the more conventional way of computing the averaged statistics @xmath64 in fig .",
    "[ delta3b ] for two energy ranges : @xmath65ev below the conical intersection , and @xmath66ev , where the difference between the symmetries is most prominent .",
    "the averaged statistics confirms the data of fig .",
    "[ delta3 ] as representative .",
    "therefore , we are convinced that these changes of the rigidity of the spectrum with energy are a property of the spectrum of , or at least of this model of it .",
    "the saturation of the curves in fig .",
    "[ delta3b]b was explained by berry@xcite in a semiclassical treatment of an integrable and a totally chaotic system . according to this paper",
    ", the value of @xmath67 at which saturation takes place is associated with the period of the shortest classical orbit of the system . at this moment , it is unclear to us , why @xmath67 is different for even and odd symmetries .    in conclusion",
    ", we have shown that the calculation of all j=0-states of a non - hydride second row molecule having a few thousand states is feasible , and we foresee that the same holds in the presence of a conical intersection , and for low lying resonances . no supercomputer is needed if one is willing to pay the price of some patience .",
