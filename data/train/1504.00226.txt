    "the iqmd model is based on the qmd model with explicitly inclusion of isospin degrees of freedom .",
    "it is well known that the dynamics at intermediate energies is mainly governed by three parts : the mean field , two - body nucleon - nucleon collisions and the pauli blocking .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to include isospin degrees of freedom to the three parts for isospin dependent dynamics . in initialization of the projectile and target nuclei , neutrons and protons should be sampled separately in phase space , especially for nuclei far away from the @xmath10-stability line , of which the neutron and proton density distributions are much different .",

    "the pre - fragments produced in iqmd are excited which are not comparable with the final products measured experimentally , it is necessary to take into account the evaporation effect to obtain realistic results .",
    "the gemini code is used to calculate de - excitation of these fragments  @xcite .",

    "c will be de - excited by using gemini . since the main purpose of the present work is to study the effect of neutron skin thickness of the projectile on the production of heavy fragments , the calculations are focused on peripheral collisions .",
    "the reduced impact parameter is used to describe the centrality of collision which is defined as @xmath54 , with @xmath55 being the maximum impact parameter . for peripheral reaction",
    ", the nucleon - nucleon interaction on the nuclear surface plays an important role , where nucleons are loosely bound and the density distributions are quite different for neutron and proton .",
    "[ multi_mc ] represents the comparison of mass versus multiplicity of fragments with and without gemini decay under the condition of @xmath56 . in the peripheral collision of iqmd ,",
    "the main reaction mechanism of fragment production is abrasion and evaporation of nucleons or light clusters , which leads to the excess of heavy products and deficiency of intermediate mass fragments ( imfs ) .",
    "in contrast , applying the afterburner significantly improves the fragments production since more complex fragments are emitted in the de - excitation calculation .",

    "@xcite , the neutron skin plays a significant role in the production of fragment , especially for the production of neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "hence , to reveal the correlation between neutron skin and the fragment production is interesting .",
    "using the iqmd model , collisions of @xmath0ca projectile on @xmath1c target at 50 mev / nucleon are simulated . in our simulations ,",
    "the diffuseness parameter @xmath60 is used for @xmath58ca , while @xmath39 varies from 1.0 to 1.6 for @xmath41ca . in the upper row of fig .",
    "[ iso_dis ] , the production yield per event for five isotopes with the charge number varying from 15 to 19 are plotted .",
    "the reason why we choose the fragments with the charge number varying from 15 to 19 is explained as follows .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to study the neutron skin effects on fragments . in our iqmd ,",
    "probability of fusion is small , so the fragments with charge number larger than projectile are neglected .",
    "the lighter fragments , which reach chemical balance at the end of the reaction will keep little information of the source nuclei , so the effect of neutron skin thickness on these fragments is very small . while the heavy residue can keep as much information of the projectile as possible .",
    "therefore , fragments with the charge number varying from 15 to 19 are chosen as a probe of neutron skin .",
    "firstly , we compare the fragment isotopic distributions from reactions induced by projectiles with different neutron excess . by comparing the two systems @xmath58ca+@xmath1c and @xmath41ca+@xmath1c with @xmath60",
    ", it is demonstrated that there are more neutron - rich fragments produced with increasing the neutron excess of the projectile .",
    "this result is similar to that in ref .",
    "secondly , we compare the reactions @xmath41ca+@xmath1c with different @xmath39 , which relates to different @xmath40 . with the increase of neutron skin thickness , yields of the isotope distributions will decrease in the neutron - rich side but have almost no change in the neutron - deficient side , which is consistent with the results by statistical abrasion - ablation model  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , it has been shown that the yield ratios of isotopic fragments from two similar reactions that differ only in the isospin asymmetry follow scaling laws  @xcite .",
    "the isotope yield ratios @xmath61 measured in two different nuclear reactions , 1 and 2 , are found to exhibit an exponential relationship as a function of the neutron number n and proton number z  @xcite , which can be expressed by following formula : @xmath62 where @xmath3 and @xmath10 are two scaling parameters and @xmath63 is an overall normalization constant .",
    "the isoscaling phenomenon is systematically investigated for fragments not heavier than @xmath64 .",
    "however , it would be interesting to investigate the behavior of heavier fragments up to the region of plf , because the heavy residues , which is mainly produced by abrasion and evaporating mechanism , may preserve some memory of the source configuration , for example , the neutron and proton density distribution .",
    "the isotopic scaling of heavy projectile residues is observed in both experiment and theoretical simulation  @xcite .",
    "consequently , from the research of isoscaling of heavy residues of projectile , some information about neutron skin of neutron - rich projectile could be extracted , since the neutron skin does effect the production of fragments  @xcite .",
    "this is our new start point . in order to investigate the neutron skin size effect on isoscaling ,",
    "the isotopic yield ratios between two reactions @xmath41ca+@xmath1c and @xmath58ca+@xmath1c are plotted as a function of the fragment neutron number , as shown in the lower row of fig .",
    "[ iso_dis ] . in the calculation",
    ", @xmath60 is used for @xmath58ca , while @xmath65 and @xmath66 are used for @xmath41ca . from the figure",
    ", we can see that larger neutron skin size will suppress the production of the neutron - rich fragment .",
    "although the neutron number and proton number of projectiles and targets are not changed in reactions @xmath41ca+@xmath1c and @xmath58ca+@xmath1c , the neutron density of @xmath41ca is different with different @xmath39 .",
    "eq.([eq7 ] ) can be simplified for isotopic yield ratio with the same charge number , @xmath67 in the grand - canonical approximation , the scaling parameter @xmath3 is equal to the difference of the chemical potentials for neutrons in the two systems , @xmath68  @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath3 is extracted by fitting @xmath69 $ ] as a function of @xmath70 .",
    "@xmath3 dependence on @xmath40 for isotopes with proton number varying from @xmath71 to @xmath72 is displayed in fig .",
    "[ scaling_skin ] .",
    "one can see that @xmath3 decreases linearly with the increasing of neutron skin thickness in the projectile .",
    "it is indicated that the scaling parameter dose not keep constant for the heavy residues with proton number close to the projectile , which is different from that for light fragment .",
    "this different isoscaling behavior between heavy and light fragments may result from different formation dynamics .",
    "the light fragments are mainly produced from multi - fragmentation , in which the system has reached chemical balance , which leads to the similar isoscaling behavior of light fragment . while the heavy residues close to projectile originate from nucleons abrasion or evaporation . in this case",
    ", most of the nucleon in projectile may only act as an spectator , and accordingly , the system is not balanced .",
    "nevertheless , the heavy residues will keep a memory of the projectile to some degree . from this",
    "result some information of neutron skin could be extracted by measuring the isoscaling behavior of the heavy residues .    finally ,",
    "neutron skin effect on @xmath4 of heavy plf is also investigated .",
    "the average @xmath4 for plf with charge number from @xmath71 to @xmath72 as a function of @xmath40 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ ratio_nskin ] .",
    "it displays that @xmath4 decreases with the increasing of @xmath40 , and there is a good linear correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath40 .",
    "this relationship could be regard as another probe for neutron skin thickness .",
    "we also can see that for a certain @xmath40 , the @xmath4 will increase with the increasing of charge number , which is similar to the results in ref .",
    "@xcite    the neutron skin effect on fragment production , isoscaling , and @xmath4 of residues could be explained as following . for different neutron skin thickness , the mainly difference of neutron density distributions is in the surface region . with increasing of @xmath40 , more neutrons",
    "are pushed to the surface of nuclei .",
    "consequently , more neutrons will be abraded in peripheral collision , which makes the residue less neutron - rich .",
    "large @xmath40 makes the neutron become more loosely bound , and more neutrons will be evaporated .",
    "using the isospin dependent quantum molecular ( iqmd ) model followed by gemini , the neutron skin effect on the production of projectile - like fragments are investigated in peripheral collisions of 50 mev / nucleon @xmath41ca+@xmath1c and @xmath58ca+@xmath1c . by changing the neutron diffuseness parameter of @xmath41ca to obtain different neutron skin thickness ( @xmath40 ) , the dependence of isotopic distributions , neutron to proton ratio ( @xmath4 ) , and isoscaling behavior of plf on @xmath40 are studied .",
    "it is demonstrated that larger @xmath40 suppresses the production of neutron - rich plf .",
    "this is because projectile with larger @xmath40 prefers to produce more free neutrons and neutron - rich light clusters .",
    "the isoscaling behavior in @xmath41ca+@xmath1c and @xmath58ca+@xmath1c are also investigated .",
    "the extracted isoscaling parameter @xmath3 decreases linearly with the increase of @xmath40 .",
    "the dependence of neutron to proton ratio ( @xmath4 ) of plf on @xmath40 displays the similar trend . with the increase of @xmath40 ,",
    "more neutrons will distribute in the nuclear surface .",
    "consequently , they will be abraded in peripheral collision more easily . in conclusion ,",
    "the isotopic distributions , isoscaling parameter @xmath3 , and neutron to proton ratios @xmath4 of plf have dependence on @xmath40 .",
