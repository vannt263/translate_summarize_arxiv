    "we consider transmission of x/@xmath0-rays through a slab assuming incident photons perpendicular to the slab , and integrate outgoing photons over all angles .",
    "this is equivalent to transmission through a geometrically thin but optically thick shell when neglecting effect of reflection .",
    "we calculate energy - dependent green s functions taking into account fully relativistic compton scattering as well as bound - free absorption .",
    "green s functions are calculated using a monte carlo method of white , lightman and zdziarski ( 1988 ) .",
    "an analytical formula fits the green functions for compton scattering and factorize impact of absorption .",
    "fig .  1 presents the total green functions and its decomposition on the first three scattering orders for various energies of incident photons and various thomson thickness of the slab . for a low optical thickness ,",
    "the second - order scattering is mostly due to photons propagating along the slab , which makes the second order green function relatively flat in the range of @xmath1=1 - 3 and the third order function peaked at @xmath1=3 ( cf .",
    "for a higher optical thickness , the second and third order green function is peaked in the forward and backward direction due to photons propagating perpendicularly to the slab .",
    "the second and third order function on fig .",
    "1c exhibits corresponding peaks near @xmath2 and @xmath3 . for high energy incident photons ,",
    "the green functions are increasingly suppressed with increasing wavelength shift because the klein - nishina decline reduces the escape probability ( cf .",
    "1a and 1d ) .",
    "the high energy photons are moved quickly to lower energies by scattering , and thus attain diffusion limit after a first few scattering .",
    "in solar composition matter , compton scattering is accompanied by bound - free absorption , which gives important contribution up to energies of about 40 kev , where compton cross - section is significantly relativistic , and no monochromatic approximation can be used . the green function in the presence of absorption may be then written as : @xmath4 here @xmath5 is an effective single scattering albedo over the distribution of photons after @xmath6 scattering . since the average wavelengh shift of photon distribution in @xmath6-th order appears at @xmath7 ( relativistic effects shift the maximum to lower values of @xmath1 ) ,",
    "a sufficient approximation is @xmath8 .",
