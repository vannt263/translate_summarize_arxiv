    "although it is widely accepted that galaxy - galaxy interactions stimulate secular evolutionary effects ( e.g. enhanced star formation - sf ) , morphological peculiarities including transitions to earlier type , enhanced or diminished gas content ) the amplitude of the effects , and processes for accomplishing them , are not well quantified ( sulentic 1976 , 1989 ; xu & sulentic 1991,verdes - montenegro et al .",
    "for example there is no clear consensus on whether sf enhancement depends on details of an encounter or the preexisting gas reservoirs available in the galaxies .",
    "it is also difficult to ascribe morphological peculiarities ( or the presence of an agn ) to interaction because they are also seen in rather isolated systems .",
    "most of these uncertainties reflect the lack of a statistically useful baseline .",
    "the goal of this proposal is to create a multiwavelength database that can serve as a zero point relative to which nurture effects can be evaluated .",
    "we are assembling a multiwavelength database for a large ( n@xmath1760 ) sample of the most isolated galaxies in the northern sky . we are using the largest reasonably unbiased sample of isolated galaxies , the catalog of isolated galaxies ( cig : karachentseva 1973 ;",
    "see also sulentic 1989 ) which originally contains n=1052 galaxies , later reduced to n=893 ( karachentseva 1980 ) .",
    "we were able to derive optical and fir luminosities for n=760 galaxies that constitute our full working sample .",
    "a cig based sample has a number of interesting characteristics and advantages including : + 1 ) isolation - selected on the basis of distance from nearest neighbors ( at least 20@xmath2 their diameter ) .",
    "we are in the process of refining the isolation parameter using the digitized poss2 atlas .",
    "local objects will also be excluded due to uncertain isolation determination .",
    "2 ) morphology - the cig is morphologically diverse to permit statistical studies correlated with hubble type . our poss2 isolation reevaluation is also providing more accurate galaxy types .",
    "3 ) depth - the cig samples a deep enough volume of space to allow us to measure a large part of the radio , ir and optical luminosity functions .",
    "4 ) completeness - the cig is reasonably complete with @xmath3v / v@xmath4@xmath5=0.42 down to b=15.7 .",
    "our database will emphasize the properties of the nonstellar material in the galaxies because this component is most sensitive to the effects of external stimuli .",
    "our database will include observations of neutral ( hi ) , molecular ( co ) and ionized ( h@xmath6 ) gas , and radiocontinuum emission as an extinction - free tracer of current sf rate and nuclear activity .",
    "this multiwavelength survey of the refined cig sample will allow us to define the mean statistical properties of the ism ( cold / warm / hot gas and dust ) in these galaxies .",
    "it will allow us to study the interplay between the sf , ism and the environment , the link between central activity ( agn ) and the environment , and the morphology distribution of isolated galaxies .",
