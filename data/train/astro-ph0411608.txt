    "recent asca , rxte , chandra and xmm - newton observations of seyfert  i galaxies have demonstrated the existence of the broad iron @xmath0 line ( 6.4  kev ) in their spectra along with a number of other weaker lines ( ne  x , si  xiii , xiv , s  xiv - xvi , ar  xvii , xviii , ca  xix , etc . )",
    "( see , for example , @xcite ) .    for some cases when the spectral resolution is good enough",
    ", the emission spectral line demonstrates the typical two - peak profile with a high `` blue '' peak and a low `` red '' peak while a long `` red '' wing drops gradually to the background level ( @xcite , see also @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the doppler line width corresponds to a very high velocity of matter .",
    "e.g. , the maximum velocity is about @xmath1  km / s for the galaxy mcg63015 @xcite and @xmath2  km / s for @xcite . for both galaxies line profiles",
    "are known rather well .",
    "@xcite analyzed results of long - time observations of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 using _ xmm - newton _ and _ bepposax_. they confirmed in general the qualitative conclusions about the features of the fe @xmath0 line , which were discovered by asca satellite .",
    "@xcite discussed the essential importance of asca calibrations and the reliability of obtained results .",
    "@xcite compared data among asca , rxte and chandra for the mcg-6 - 30 - 15 .",
    "@xcite analyzed in detail the variabilities in continuum and in fe @xmath0 line for mcg-6 - 30 - 15 galaxy .",
    "the phenomena of the broad emission lines are supposed to be related with accreting matter around black holes . @xcite",
    "proposed physical models of accretion discs for mcg-6 - 30 - 15 and showed their influence on the fe @xmath0 line shape .",
    "@xcite found the features of the spectral line near 7  kev in seyfert galaxies with data from _ xmm - newton _ satellite .",
    "@xcite presented results of chandra hetg observations of seyfert  i galaxies .",
    "@xcite discussed a possible identification of binary massive black holes with the analysis of fe @xmath0 profiles .",
    "@xcite used the data of x - ray observations to estimate an abundance of the iron .",
    "@xcite discussed an influence of microlensing on the distortion of spectral lines ( including fe @xmath0 line ) that can be significant in some cases , optical depth for microlensing in x - ray band was evaluated by @xcite .",
    "@xcite analyzed an influence of compton effect on emitted and reflected spectra of the fe @xmath0 profiles .",
    "in addition , @xcite presented a possible scenario for evolution of such supermassive black holes .",
    "@xcite proposed a procedure to estimate the masses of supermassive black holes .",
    "general status of black holes was described in a number of papers ( see , e.g. @xcite and references therein , @xcite ) .",
    "since the matter motions indicate very high rotational velocities , one can assume the @xmath0 line emission arises in the inner regions of accretion discs at distances @xmath3 from the black holes .",
    "let us recall that the innermost stable circular orbit for non - rotational black hole ( which has the schwarzschild metric ) is located at the distance of @xmath4 from the black hole singularity .",
    "therefore , a rotation of black hole could be the most essential factor . a possibility to observe the matter motion in",
    "so strong gravitational fields could give a chance not only to check general relativity predictions and simulate physical conditions in accretion discs , but investigate also observational manifestations of such astrophysical phenomena like jets @xcite , some instabilities like rossby waves @xcite and gravitational radiation .",
    "observations and theoretical interpretations of broad x - ray lines ( particularly , the iron @xmath0 line ) in agns are actively discussed in a number of papers @xcite .",
    "the results of numerical simulations are also presented in the framework of different physical assumptions on the origin of the broad emissive iron @xmath0 line in the nuclei of seyfert galaxies @xcite .",
    "the results of fe @xmath0 line observations and their possible interpretation are summarized by @xcite .    according to the standard interpretation",
    "these @xmath0 lines are formed due to the cold thin and optically thick accretion disk illumination by hot clouds @xcite , however another geometry for regions of hot and cold clouds located near black holes is not excluded .",
    "for example , @xcite considered a more complicated structure of accretion disks including warps , clumps and spirals .",
    "@xcite investigated a possibility to explain fe @xmath5 line with the model that the innermost part of a disk is disrupted owing to disk instabilities and forms cold clouds which move not exactly in the equatorial plane , but they form a layer ( or shell ) covering a significant part of sky from the point of view of central x - ray source ( actually , that is a detailed analysis of ideas suggested by @xcite ) .",
    "other features of such a model were discussed by @xcite .",
    "an influence of warps on x - ray emission line shapes were investigated recently by @xcite analyzing photon geodesics in the schwarzschild black hole metric .",
    "broad spectral lines are considered to be formed by radiation emitted in the vicinity of black holes .",
    "if there are strong magnetic fields near black holes these lines are split by the field into several components .",
    "such lines have been found in microquasars , grbs and other similar objects @xcite .    to obtain an estimation of the magnetic field",
    "we simulate the formation of the line profile for different values of magnetic field in the framework of the simple model of non - flat accretion flows assuming that emitting particles move along orbits with constant radial coordinates , but not exactly in the equatorial plane .",
    "earlier , @xcite analyzed an influence of magnetic field on a distortion of @xmath0 line considering equatorial circular motion of emitting region of the fe @xmath0 line radiation . here",
    "we will use the simple model of a non - flat accretion flow @xcite to analyze the non - equatorial plane motion of particles emitting x - band photons .",
    "actually , we will use a generalization of the previous annulus model described earlier by @xcite . as a result",
    "we find the minimal @xmath6 value of magnetic field at which the distortion of the line profile becomes significant .",
    "here we do not use an approach , which is based on numerical simulations of trajectories of the photons emitted by annuli moving along a circular geodesics near black hole , described earlier by @xcite . in this paper",
    "we generalize previous considerations for the the simple model of non - flat accretion flow .",
    "magnetic fields play a key role in dynamics of accretion discs and jet formation . @xcite considered a scenario to generate super strong magnetic fields near black holes . according to their results magnetic fields near the marginally stable orbit",
    "could be about @xmath7  g. however , if we use a model of the poynting ",
    "robertson magnetic field generation then only small magnetic fields are generated @xcite .",
    "@xcite has shown that the strength of the magnetic fields near super massive black holes can reach the values of @xmath8  g due to the virial theorem  g. ] , and considered a generation of synchrotron radiation , acceleration of @xmath9 pairs and cosmic rays in magnetospheres of super massive black holes at such high fields .",
    "it is the magnetic field that plays a key role in these models .",
    "below , based on the analysis of iron @xmath0 line profile in the presence of a strong magnetic field , we describe how to detect the field itself or at least obtain an upper limit of the magnetic field .",
    "one of the basic problems in understanding the physics of quasars and microquasars is the `` central engine '' in these systems , in particular , a physical mechanism to accelerate charged particles and generate energetic electromagnetic radiation near black holes",
    ". the construction of such `` central engine '' without magnetic fields could hardly ever be possible .",
    "on the other hand , magnetic fields make it possible to extract energy from rotational black holes via penrose process and blandford  znajek mechanism , as it was shown in mhd simulations by @xcite .",
    "the blandford  znajek process could provide huge energy release in agns ( for example , for mcg-6 - 30 - 15 ) and microquasars when the magnetic field is strong enough @xcite .",
    "physical aspects of generation and evolution of magnetic fields were considered in a set of reviews ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a number of papers conclude that in the vicinity of the marginally stable orbit the magnetic fields could be high enough @xcite . @xcite",
    "considered the influence of magnetic fields on the accretion rate near the marginally stable orbit and hence on the disc structure .",
    "they found the appropriate changes of the emitting spectrum and solitary spectral lines .",
    "@xcite investigated the instabilities of accretion discs in the case when the magnetic fields play an important role .",
    "@xcite analyzed an influence of magnetic field on accretion disk structure and its emissivity through the magnetic coupling of a rotating black hole with its surrounding accretion disk .",
    "magnetic field could play a key role in fe @xmath5 line emission , since coronae around accretion disks could be magnetic reservoirs of energy to provide a high energy radiation @xcite or magnetic flares could help to understand an origin of narrow fe @xmath5 lines and their temporal dependences @xcite .",
    "@xcite calculated x - ray spectrum for the flare model and pointed out some signatures of the model to distinguish it from the well - known lamppost model where it is assumed that an x - ray source illuminates the inner part of accretion disk in a relatively steady way .",
    "the magnetic pressure at the inner edges of the accretion discs and its correspondence with the black hole spin parameter @xmath10 in the framework of disc accretion models is discussed by  @xcite .",
    "however , the numerical value of magnetic field is determined there from a model - dependent procedure , in which a number of parameters can not be found explicitly from observations .    here",
    "we consider the influence of magnetic field on the iron @xmath0 line profile line for brevity . ] and show how one can determine the value of the magnetic field strength or at least an upper limit .",
    "the profile of a monochromatic line @xcite depends on the angular momentum of a black hole , the inclination angle of observer , the value of the radial coordinate if the emitting region represents an infinitesimal ring ( or two radial coordinates for outer and inner bounds of a wide disc ) .",
    "the influence of accretion disc model on the profile of spectral line was discussed by @xcite .",
    "we assume that the emitting region is located in the area of a strong quasi - static magnetic field .",
    "this field causes line splitting due to the standard zeeman effect .",
    "there are three characteristic frequencies of the split line that arise in the emission @xcite .",
    "the energy of central component @xmath11 remains unchanged , whereas two extra components are shifted by @xmath12 , where @xmath13  erg / g is the bohr magneton .",
    "therefore , in the presence of a magnetic field we have three energy levels : @xmath14 and @xmath15 . for the iron @xmath0 line they are as follows : @xmath16 kev , @xmath17  kev and @xmath18 kev .",
    "@xcite pointed out that for a strong field , there is also a net blueshift of the centroid of the transition line component which is quadratic in @xmath19 . for hydrogen - like ions @xcite give    @xmath20    where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the principal and orbital quantum numbers of the upper state , @xmath23 is the bohr radius , and @xmath24 is the nuclear charge ( = 26 for fe ) .    let us discuss how the line profile changes when photons are emitted in the co - moving frame with energy @xmath25 , but not with @xmath11 . in that case the line profile can be obtained from the original one by @xmath26 times stretching along the energy axis , the component with @xmath27 energy should be @xmath28 times stretched , respectively .",
    "the intensities of different zeeman components are approximately equal @xcite , each of which depends on the direction of the quantum escape with respect to the direction of the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "however , we neglect this weak dependence ( undoubtedly , the dependence can be counted and , as a result , some details in the spectrum profile can be slightly changed , but the qualitative picture , which we discuss , remains unchanged ) . as a consequence , the composite line profile can be found by summation the initial line with energy @xmath11 and two other profiles , obtained by stretching this line along the @xmath29-axis in @xmath30 and @xmath28 times correspondingly .",
    "another indicator of the zeeman effect is a significant induction of the polarization of x - ray emission : the extra lines possess a circular polarization ( right and left , respectively , when they are observed along the field direction ) whereas a linear polarization arises if the magnetic field is perpendicular to the line of sight .- disc were discussed by  @xcite . ] despite of the fact that the measurements of polarization of x - ray emission have not been carried out yet , such experiments can be realized in the nearest future @xcite .    with increase of the magnetic field",
    "the peak profile structure becomes apparent and can be distinctly revealed , however , the field @xmath31  g is rather strong , so the classical linear expression for the zeeman splitting @xmath32 should be modified .",
    "nevertheless , we use eq.([eq15a ] ) for any value of the magnetic field , assuming that the qualitative picture of peak splitting remains unchanged , whereas for @xmath33  g the exact maximum positions may appear slightly different .",
    "if the zeeman energy splitting @xmath34 is of the order of @xmath35 , the line splitting due to magnetic fields is described in a more complicated way .",
    "the discussion of this phenomenon is not a point of this paper .",
    "our aim is to pay attention to the qualitative features of this effect .",
    "thus , besides magnetic field , the line profiles depend on the accretion model as well as on the structure of emitting regions . problems of such kind may become actual with much better accuracy of observational data in comparison with their current state .",
    "the relativistic generalization of liouville s theorem was used to calculate the spectral flux by many authors ( e.g. @xcite ) . just after @xcite finished the analysis of the time - averaged structure of a thin , equatorial disk of material accreting onto a black hole , @xcite used liouville s theorem to give a prediction about the x - ray continuum from the disk .",
    "simulations of iron line profiles started from the paper by @xcite .",
    "these calculations are based on assumptions about geometrically thin , optically thick disks .",
    "these results were generalized by @xcite to a kerr black hole case .",
    "many authors ( e.g. @xcite ) also used the thin - disk model with cunningham s approach : the solid angle was evaluated as a function of both the emission radius @xmath37 and the frequency shift @xmath38 ; the propagation of the line radiation was considered to emit from the thin disk in the range from the innermost radius @xmath39 to the outermost radius @xmath40 .",
    "thus , the flux carried by a bundle of photons from a whole disk needs the integration over @xmath37 . in this case , a single value of @xmath41 was fixed in advance to simulate the thin - disk . another approach to simulate line profiles for flat accretion disk was proposed by @xcite which is based on qualitative analysis developed in previous papers by @xcite .",
    "in fact , different from the continuum , iron @xmath5 line is believed to originate via fluorescence in the very inner part of a disc ( e.g. @xcite ) , within which particles exist in spherical orbits between the minimum and maximum latitudes about the equatorial plane of the central black hole @xcite in the form of a hot torus @xcite or a shell ( or a layer ) formed by cold clouds which could be illuminated by hot clouds @xcite .",
    "therefore , the mechanism of the fe line emissions should be re - considered with the non - disk formulation , which is connected with several parameters in both sets of coordinates , such as the spin of the black hole , particles constants of motion , photons s impact parameters , the thickness and the radial position of the shell , the polar angle of the shell , etc . in our work , as done by previous authors with the thin - disk model @xcite , we make following assumptions : ( 1 ) the emitting `` shell '' is geometrically thin ; i.e. , at radius @xmath37 its thickness @xmath42 is always much less than @xmath37 .",
    "this permits us to treat particles as a thin - shelled ensemble at @xmath37 surrounding a bh .",
    "( 2 ) the emission is isotropic and the emitted fluorescent fe k@xmath36 line from particles can be described by a @xmath43-function in frequency , which gives each emitted photon an energy of 6.4  kev .",
    "that is , particles are monochromatic .",
    "( 3 ) photons emitted by shell particles are homogeneous and are free to reach the observer .    for a given @xmath10 ,",
    "there are sets of three constants of motion at one radius @xmath37 .",
    "that is , a thin shell means a collection of sets of three constants of motion , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "considering the monotonous relations between @xmath45 and @xmath44 ( or @xmath46 ) , the number of the sets can be simply represented by @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , different from the fact that the continuum is an integration over @xmath37 in disk models , the line flux should be a superimposition of all possible individual emissions with every @xmath44 at @xmath37 .",
    "with the thin - disk model , previous authors ( e.g. , @xcite ) considered the emitted intensity @xmath47 as a created parameter @xmath48 , in which @xmath49 is defined as `` the line - emissivity law '' with different artificial forms versus the radius of emission @xmath37 only ; @xmath50 is the rest frequency of the emission .",
    "fortunately , a more realistic form of @xmath51 was deduced by @xcite , in which @xmath51 is expressed as a function of @xmath37 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "however , liouville s equation contains not only the invariant photon four - momentum , but the four - velocity & four - coordinate components of particles as well",
    ". let @xmath54 ( ergs s@xmath55 @xmath56 sr@xmath55 ev@xmath55 ) be the specific intensity and @xmath57 ( @xmath58 dyn@xmath59 s@xmath59 ) the photon distribution function .",
    "the relationship between @xmath54 and @xmath57 is ( @xcite ) : @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is planck constant , @xmath62 is the k@xmath36 frequency of an iron atom with 4-coordinate @xmath63 and 4-velocity @xmath64 .",
    "coefficient @xmath65 means only half of photons emitted outwards and 2 indicates that there exists both states of the photon quantum per phase - space .",
    "the expression of @xmath57 is ( @xcite ) @xmath66 where @xmath67 ( @xmath58 ) is photon s number density . according to the last assumption , @xmath68 .    the dimensionless relative flux versus the shift @xmath69 depends on three parameters : the black hole spin @xmath10 , the radial position @xmath37 of emitters , and the inclination angle @xmath70 of the observer .",
    "the flux expression is ( c.f .",
    ", e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath71 in which the integration over the element of the solid angle @xmath72 covers the image of the spherical ring in the observer s sky plane ; the solid angle is expressed by impact parameters @xmath36 , @xmath73 of the observer which are related to the constants of motion ; @xmath74 ; @xmath69 is the general relativistic frequency shift ; the sum @xmath75 is to all values of @xmath44 , which reflects that the flux is contributed by all photons emitted from all particles ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "this model could be interpreted as a simplified version of some distribution of clouds in the `` quasi - spherical '' accretion model developed earlier by @xcite to evaluate optical / uv / soft x - ray emission of agns .",
    "we use such a distribution of clouds to calculate the fe @xmath5 line shapes in presence of a strong magnetic field which could play a significant role in such models @xcite .    in numerical simulations of photon geodesics",
    "we used their analytical analysis to reduce numerical errors .",
    "a qualitative analysis of the geodesic equations showed that types of photon motion can drastically vary with small changes of chosen geodesic parameters @xcite . in our approach",
    "we use results of this analysis and numerical calculations of photon geodesics @xcite .",
    "we have calculated spectral line shapes for different parameters of the model .",
    "below we briefly describe results of these calculations .",
    "[ figure2 ] shows a series of spectral line profiles for @xmath76 , @xmath77 and the inclination angle of observer obs@xmath78 ( it means that an observer is located in the equatorial plane ) for magnetic fields @xmath79 g , @xmath80 g , @xmath81 g , @xmath82 g respectively .",
    "corresponding parameter values are indicated in the left top angle of each panel .",
    "one could see from these panels that magnetic field @xmath83 g does not distort significantly the spectral line profiles , but @xmath81 g gives a significant broadening the peaks of the profile and as a result the shortest red peak may be not distinguishable from observational point of view . the spectral line profile for @xmath84 g demonstrates a significant difference from the spectral line profile with respectively `` low '' magnetic field like in first panel @xmath79 g , because there is an evident three peaked structure of the spectral line profile for @xmath85 g .",
    "[ figure3 ] shows a series of spectral line profiles for @xmath76 , @xmath86 and obs@xmath87 and for magnetic fields @xmath79 g , @xmath80 g , @xmath81 g , @xmath82 g , respectively . in this case the magnetic field @xmath83 g also does not distort significantly the spectral line profiles , but @xmath88 g gives a significant broadening the profile and as a result the shortest extra blue peak is disappeared and the initial structure of the the spectral line profile with high and low blue peaks and a red peak is changed to a two - peaked structure with a red peak and a blue peak . as in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] , the spectral line profile for @xmath89 g demonstrates a significant difference from the spectral line profile with respectively `` low '' magnetic field like in the first panel @xmath79 g. this result is general for our calculations and applicable for all cases considered below .",
    "[ figure3a ] shows a series of spectral line profiles for @xmath76 , @xmath90 and obs@xmath91 for magnetic fields @xmath79 g , @xmath80 g , @xmath81 g , @xmath82 g , respectively . in this case",
    "the blue peak is higher than the red one ( such types of peaks were calculated also by @xcite for the warped disks ) . as for previous case ( fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ) magnetic field @xmath83 g does not distort significantly the spectral line profiles , but @xmath88 g gives a significant broadening the peaks of the profile and as a result sub - peaked structure between blue and red peaks is disappeared .",
    "the zeeman split of one peaked spectral line profiles is presented in fig .",
    "[ figure4]-[figure6 ] .",
    "similar spectral line profiles ( without zeeman splitting ) were calculated in the framework of a warped disk model by @xcite and for a cloud model by @xcite .",
    "[ figure4 ] shows that for @xmath92 , @xmath93 and obs@xmath87 , there is only one single peak , but there is no bump around this peak for low magnetic fields .",
    "[ figure5 ] shows that for @xmath76 , @xmath93 and obs@xmath91 , there is also only one single peak , but there is a broad bump around this peak for low magnetic fields ( evidences for such a kind of bump was found by @xcite using data of xmm - epic observations of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 g ) in the seyfert galaxy mcg-6 - 30 - 15 and even there is magnetic extraction of energy because of blandford  znajek effect ,",
    "but of course , these magnetic fields are too low to lead to a significant changes of the iron @xmath0 line due to zeeman splitting . ] ) .",
    "[ figure6 ] shows that for @xmath94 , @xmath93 and obs@xmath87 , there is also only one single peak and there is a bump around this peak for low magnetic fields",
    "[ figure5],[figure6 ] demonstrate two cases where zeeman splitting gives significant changes of spectral line profiles , in which evident single peak structure for low magnetic fields is changed into a three - peaked structure for high magnetic fields @xmath95 g .            summarizing these results of calculations for considered examples , we note that magnetic fields @xmath96 g produce significant changes of spectral line profiles , but @xmath97 g could be responsible for essential broadening the profile peaks .",
    "therefore , in principle there is a possibility to measure magnetic fields about @xmath98 g that could be generated near galactic black hole candidates and probably near black hole horizons in some agns .",
    "it is known that fe @xmath0 lines are found not only in agns and microquasars but also in x - ray afterglows of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) @xcite . a theoretical model for grbs was suggested recently by @xcite . in the framework of this model a magnetized torus ( shell ) around rapidly rotating black hole",
    "could be formed after black hole - neutron star coalescence . in this case",
    "magnetic fields could be even much higher than @xmath99  g. therefore , an influence of magnetic fields on spectral line profiles can be very significant and we must take into account zeeman splitting .",
    "results of 3d magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) simulations demontrated that there are non - equatorial and non - axisymmetric density patterns and some configurations like tori or shells could be formed @xcite . moreover",
    ", an analysis of instabilities of accretion flows showed that warps , tilts and caustic surfaces could arise not only in the equatorial plane @xcite .",
    "observations also gave some indirect evidences for more complicated accretion flows ( than the standard thin accretion flow ) because there are some signatures for a precession and a nutation ( for example , there is a significant precession of the accretion disk for the ss433 binary system @xcite ) .",
    "it is evident that duplication ( triplication ) of a blue peak could be caused not only by the influence of a magnetic field ( the zeeman effect ) , but by a number of other factors .",
    "for example , the line profile can have multiple peaks when the emitting region represents multiple shells with different radial coordinates ( it is easy to conclude that two emitting rings with finite widths separated by a gap , would yield a similar effect ) .",
    "actually , such an explanation was proposed by @xcite to fit the fe @xmath5 shape in ngc 3516 . despite of the fact that a multiple blue peak can be generated by many causes ( including the zeeman effect as one of possible explanation )",
    ", the absence of the multiple peak can lead to a estimation of an upper limit of the magnetic field .",
    "it is known that neutron stars ( pulsars ) could have huge magnetic fields .",
    "so , it means that the effect discussed above could appear in binary neutron star systems and in single neutron stars as well @xcite .",
    "the quantitative description of such systems , however , needs more detailed computations .",
    "similar to considerations presented in paper by @xcite , analyzing fe @xmath5 shapes for mcg-6 - 30 - 15 galaxy and using asca data @xcite one could evaluate a magnetic field for this case ; namely a magnetic field should be less than @xmath100  g and the estimate is independent on a character of accretion flow .",
    "so , we could use the estimate for non - flat accretion flows for mcg-6 - 30 - 15 seyfert galaxy and generalize conclusions by @xcite for more general cases of accretion flows .    as an extended work of the first paper by zakharov et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , the estimates of magnetic field may seem not very precise .",
    "but one could mention that the rough estimates are caused by a noisy observational data since as a matter of fact , present spaceborne instrumentations vary greatly in their sensitivities and resolutions and precisions of measurements are not very high to have good estimates .",
    "moreover , it would be difficult to reveal a compromisable list quantitatively of possible limiting effects restricted by different detections .",
    "however , @xcite are trying to focus on specific asca observations of pks 0637 - 752 in the range 1.3 - 24.8 kev @xcite and provide an estimation of the minimum magnetic field detectable with the satellite taking into account a new x - ray emission hypothesis @xcite , other than a fluorescent assumption .",
    "the analysis is based on the laboratory measurements and identification of iron line experiments in lawrence livermore national laboratory @xcite .    with further increase of observational facilities it may become possible to improve the above estimation .",
    "the constellation - x launch suggested in the coming decade seems to increase the precision of x - ray spectroscopy as many as approximately 100 times with respect to the present day measurements @xcite .",
    "therefore , there is a possibility in principle that the upper limit of the magnetic field can also greatly improved in the case when the emission of the x - ray line arises in a sufficiently narrow region .",

    "<S> observations of agns and microquasars by asca , rxte , chandra and xmm - newton indicate the existence of broad x - ray emission lines of ionized heavy elements in their spectra . </S>",
    "<S> such spectral lines were discovered also in x - ray spectra of neutron stars and x - ray afterglows of grbs . </S>",
    "<S> recently , @xcite described a procedure to estimate an upper limit of the magnetic fields in regions from which x - ray photons are emitted . </S>",
    "<S> the authors simulated typical profiles of the iron @xmath0 line in the presence of magnetic field and compared them with observational data in the framework of the widely accepted accretion disk model . here </S>",
    "<S> we further consider typical zeeman splitting in the framework of a model of non - flat accretion flows , which is a generalization of previous consideration into non - equatorial plane motion of particles emitting x - ray photons . </S>",
    "<S> using perspective facilities of space borne instruments ( e.g. constellation - x mission ) a better resolution of the blue peak structure of iron @xmath0 line will allow to evaluate the magnetic fields with higher accuracy .    </S>",
