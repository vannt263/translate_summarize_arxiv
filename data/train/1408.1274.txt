    "citation analysis has great potential to help researchers find useful academic papers @xcite , for inventors to find interesting patents @xcite , or for judges to discover relevant past judgements @xcite .",
    "it is not , however , enough to simply count citations , which can be made for a variety of reasons beyond an author genuinely finding a document useful @xcite . to interpret the information encoded in a citation network we must also understand the structure of citation networks and the kinds of generative mechanisms which can create them .",
    "these networks have a complex structure which is not easily described by any simple model and so are not easily characterised .",
    "the underlying processes which generate the network s structure are hard to observe directly but can be inferred from the network s structure itself by comparing networks to each other , or to models whose generating mechanisms we know . in order to compare two networks we need to be able to characterise their structure in ways relevant to the dynamics we are interested in . to begin to tackle this problem",
    "there has been much recent interest in trying to identify the statistical distribution of citation counts @xcite , and various other aspects of the topology of the citation network @xcite .",
    "when networks exist under some constraints , it is often possible to create new methods of characterising their structure which better take those constraints into account , as is well known for networks embedded in space @xcite .",
    "there is also interest in developing a geometric approach to studying network structure by finding a hidden space in which a network s nodes are embedded which then determines the network s structure@xcite .",
    "citation networks are constrained in time , because authors can only cite something that has already been written .",
    "this causal constraint prevents closed loops of directed edges in the graph , since all edges must point the same direction in time , and is the same constraint placed on causally connected events in physics .",
    "they can therefore be represented as directed acyclic graphs ( dag ) where a directed edge goes from node a to node b represents document a having cited the document b.    in this paper we approach these temporally constrained networks from a geometric point of view , except instead of an underlying manifold with a positive definite distance ( such as usual euclidean space of spatial networks , or a hyperbolic space of @xcite ) we consider a lorentzian manifold ; in particular , the simplest case which is minkowski space , where points have a spatial position , but also a position in time .",
    "we will characterise the network s structure using tools from the causal set approach to quantum gravity which take a set of connected points and compare their causal structure to the causal structure of minkowski space .",
    "in particular , we will use methods which estimate the dimension of a minkowski space from its causal structure .",
    "the rest of this paper is structured as follows .",
    "we will first introduce the causal set perspective of dags , seeing how they can be embedded in space and time , and the methods of estimating their dimension . in the second section we will adapt these methods for use on citation networks and test them on examples from academic papers , patents and court judgements .",
    "we will conclude by interpreting our results in terms of using dimension as a measure of citation diversity .",

    "we direct the reader to @xcite for more details .",
    "we will consider only the simplest spacetimes , @xmath0 dimensional minkowski spacetimes of one time dimension and @xmath1 spatial dimensions .",
    ", the measurement of which we will use to characterise the network s structure .",
    "furthermore , all other lorentzian manifolds can be approximated , locally , as minkowski space .",
    "] to create a causal set which approximates the structure of minkowski space , we begin by randomly and uniformly scattering points in minkowski space by randomly assigning each point an associated time @xmath2 and spatial co - ordinates @xmath3 .",
    "two points are causally connected if and only if the differences in their co - ordinates satisfy : @xmath4 which is to say their separation in time is larger than their separation in space , using the speed of light to convert between the units of space and time ( equivalently we choose units where the speed of light is equal to @xmath5 ) .",
    "if this relationship is satisfied we then say that the point with the larger / smaller @xmath2 coordinate is in the future / past lightcone of the other .",
    "in special relativity it is this relationship that defines whether two events in spacetime can causally affect one another .",
    "the direction of the edges is determined by the causal / temporal ordering as given by the ordering of the time coordinates , and provides a uniquely defined causal relationship . to translate this structure into the language of networks",
    ", we say each point is a node , and we add edges between nodes which are causally connected , i.e.  satisfying ( [ eq : minkowski ] ) , with a direction reflecting the flow of time .",
    "we will use the convention that all edges point backwards in time .",
    "such a network is necessarily a dag because all of the edges point the same directed in time .",
    "an * interval * [ a , b ] in a dag is the set of nodes which can be reached from a ( are in its causal past ) in one direction , and from b in the other direction ( in its causal future)@xcite as in figure  [ fig : example ] .",
    "the dimension estimates used here are defined on an interval in a dag .    to illustrate these estimates we will use a simple network model involving randomly scattering points in an interval in minkowski space .",
    "we first create two extremal points with time co - ordinates of @xmath6 , and @xmath5 respectively , and all spatial co - ordinates of @xmath6 .",
    "we then add more nodes to the network by assigning a random time co - ordinate between @xmath6 and @xmath5 , and random spatial co - ordinates between @xmath7 and @xmath8 and allowing this node to be in the network if it has edges to the two extremal nodes and so lie within the interval such that @xmath9 is a network created by this process with @xmath10 nodes , which have are described by @xmath0 coordinates .",
    "we will refer to these networks as * spacetime networks * though they are also known as cone spaces in the mathematics literature @xcite .",
    "the number of spatial dimensions will determine the structure of the graph this process creates .",
    "extra spatial dimensions add further terms to the summation on the right hand side of ( [ eq : minkowski ] ) and make it less likely that two points are connected .",
    "so if we were to forget about the space and time coordinates of each point , it would be possible to estimate the number of spatial dimensions by looking only at the network s structure .",
    "we will use two such methods : the midpoint - scaling dimension estimate , and the myrheim - meyer dimension estimate .",
    "when nodes are uniformly and randomly scattered in a space , the number of points in a region is proportional to the volume , @xmath11 , of that region@xcite . in a minkowski space",
    ", the longest path through an interval corresponds to the geodesic through the continuous spacetime limit ( the myrheim length conjecture ) @xcite .",
    "this means that in an interval the length of the longest path , @xmath12 is proportional to the time difference between the starting and ending nodes .",
    "we then expect , in a d - dimensional minkowski space that @xmath13 .",
    "knowing how the size of an interval scales with its height allows the dimension to be inferred .    the midpoint - scaling dimension @xcite measures how the size of two subintervals scale with the size of a larger interval between two nodes .",
    "the two subintervals of interval [ a , b ] are [ a , c ] and [ c , b ] , which have populations @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the midpoint , c , is the node on the longest path such that smaller population of @xmath14 and @xmath15 is maximised .    since [ a , c ] and [ c , b ] each have around half the height of [ a , b ] we can estimate the manifold dimension of this interval using @xmath16",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : mpsd ] .",
    "an * n - chain * in a dag is a sequence of @xmath17 nodes which are all causally connected to each other . when points are placed at random with uniform probability density in spacetime in an interval the expected number of @xmath17-chains @xmath18 ,",
    "is known to be @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath0 is the dimension of the minkowski spacetime and @xmath20 is the standard gamma function .",
    "given a dag we can simply count the number of chains and numerically find an estimate for the dimension using this formula .",
    "estimates for dimension can be made using chains of any length @xmath17 , but there are significantly larger number of 2-chains ( just a pair of causally connected points ) and so these produce the most accurate estimation of dimension .",
    "the expected number of 2-chains is simply @xmath21 for a given interval , the left hand side of this equation can be measured , and the right hand side , @xmath22 is a monotonically decreasing function , so we can estimate @xmath0 by inverting it numerically .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      it is also possible to estimate the dimension of a spacetime network by comparing the average in / out degree of a node before and after transitive reduction ( tr ) .",
    "tr is an operation on directed graphs which removes all edges implied by transitivity , the result of which is uniquely defined if the graph is acyclic @xcite ( see figure  [ fig : example ] ) .",
    "we will call the degree after tr the * reduced degree * , @xmath23 .",
    "taking figure  [ fig : mpsd ] as an example , consider the triangular node at the bottom of the diagram .",
    "it s degree before tr is @xmath24 and its degree after is @xmath25 ( as shown by the 4 remaining links ) .",
    "we show in appendix a that for a two - dimensional spacetime network the distribution of reduced degrees @xmath23 is proportional to the unsigned stirling numbers of the first kind . for large @xmath10",
    "the degree distribution is roughly poissonian with a mean of @xmath26 . for other dimensions",
    "the expected reduced degree is roughly @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "however , we found that the dimension estimate given by this method does not display the consistency of the other two methods described here when used on citation networks .",
    "this is primarily because in a given citation network nodes which have the same degree can have reduced degrees which differ by more than an order of magnitude , as shown in appendix a. in @xcite we suggest that the reduced degree of a node reveals particular properties of the paper it represents , and given such variation this method is too noisy to use as a way of characterising the network as a whole .",
    "the methods described above are designed to estimate the dimension of the spacetime in which the nodes of a dag are randomly scattered .",
    "dags which represent citation networks do not originate from points scattered in a minkowski space , and so there is no original ` dimension ' for us to estimate .    despite this",
    ", these algorithms to estimate dimension can be applied to any dag , and a result can be obtained . however",
    ", our interpretation of this result does have to change .",
    "we are now no longer investigating the properties of a space in which the nodes are embedded , but instead just characterising the dag s structure in a way that is _ analogous _ to embedding it in some minkowski spacetime .",
    "we do not claim that citation networks actually have the same structures as the spacetime networks described above , only that these tools are useful characterisations of different citation networks .",
    "some work is needed to adapt these dimension estimators to use on citation networks because citation networks do not necessarily share some of the particular properties of the spacetime networks used in these estimators .",
    "firstly , the spacetime networks are constructed to be an interval , that is there is only one ` start ' , or ` source ' node ( with zero in - degree ) and one ` end ' or ` sink ' node ( with zero out - degree ) , both of which are reachable from any node in the network .",
    "this is almost always not the case for citation networks .",
    "so instead of estimating the dimension of the whole citation network , we look at many small intervals within the citation network and apply the estimators to these intervals . to find intervals we choose two nodes uniformly at random from the network , and if an interval exists between them we estimate its dimension",
    ", otherwise we ignore this pair of nodes .",
    "we then plot the population of the interval against its estimated dimension .",
    "secondly , the spacetime networks are always * transitively complete*. that is if node a is in the future lightcone of b , and b is in the future lightcone of c then a is necessarily in the future lightcone of c. in the network the edges ( a , b ) and ( b , c ) imply ( a , c ) . in citation networks",
    "this constraint is not present since if an author cites a paper , they do not also have to cite its entire bibliography .",
    "a consequence of this is that there is no distinction in spacetime networks between edges and causal connections , but in citation networks they are different .",
    "so in our implementation of the myrheim - meyer dimension estimator we seek to count chains of causally connected nodes and not just edges .",
    "to do this we first transitively complete the network @xcite ( adding edges between any two nodes if there is a path between them ) before counting the 2-chains which are now just the edges .      to test these dimension",
    "estimates we used citation networks from academic papers , patents and court judgements .",
    "the academic citation networks are from subsections of the arxiv online research paper repository , from the citation network visualiser paperscape @xcite .",
    "the citation network is separated out into the subsections of the arxiv , and each consists of the citations from one paper in that subsection to another also in that subsection . here",
    "we will look at the ` high energy theory ' , ` high energy phenomenology ' , ` astrophysics ' , and ` quantum physics ' sections , labelled by their tags on the arxiv , ` hep - th ` , ` hep - ph ` , ` astro - ph ` , ` quant - ph ` respectively .",
    "their sizes range from around 20,000 to around 120,000 nodes and stretch in time from 1991 to 2013 .    since patents must cite other patents that contain ` prior art ' they also form a citation network .",
    "we use data derived from patents registered in the usa between 1975 and 1999 @xcite and in total there are around 4,000,000 patents .",
    "court decisions also cite previous decisions as precedent so form a citation network .",
    "we will analyse the network formed by all decisions and citations made by the us supreme court from its inception in 1754 to 2002 @xcite , in total around 25,000 nodes .",
    "further discussion of these particular datasets is available in our previous paper @xcite and our datasets will be made available on figshare @xcite .",
    "figures [ fig : hep - th ] , [ fig : quant - ph ] , [ fig : astro - ph ] and [ fig : hep - ph ] scatter plots for each arxiv section , plotting the population of an interval against its estimated dimension .",
    "each point in coloured by the publication date of the last node in the interval allowing us to see how the estimated dimension changes as more papers are added to the citation network .",
    "it is immediately clear from the differing shapes of the histograms in figures  [ fig : hep - th ] to  [ fig : ussc ] that there are structural differences in the citation networks analysed here which have been revealed by these dimension estimates . in general",
    "there is a large spread of measured dimensions suggesting structural heterogeneity unlike the homogeneous minkowski space .",
    "this is unsurprising given that citation networks show high levels of clustering and usually contain many different communities with strong intra - community links but weak inter - community links @xcite .    in all four arxiv citation networks",
    "the two plots , for myrheim - meyer dimension and midpoint - scaling dimension , show similar shapes , and converge on a consistent dimension value for large interval sizes . for networks generated from scattering points in a minkowski space",
    "there is an underlying dimension being estimated and so it is reasonable to expect independent methods to agree .",
    "this is not obviously the case in other networks so it is encouraging to see consistency between the two methods in real social networks .    crudely , the ` dimension ' of the ` hep - th ` network appears to be around 2 , and the ` hep - ph ` network around 3 , ` astro - ph ` around 3.5 , and ` quant - ph ` also around 3 .",
    "we note that each of the individual arxiv citation networks , containing only intra - section links are themselves sub - networks of the larger arxiv citation network .",
    "they have significantly different estimated dimensions strongly suggesting that the arxiv citation network is structurally heterogeneous , with its different communities having measurably different citation behaviours .",
    "we suggest that these estimates could provide a novel method of measuring these differences in other large , heterogeneous citation networks , or dags representing other systems , and can identify relevant subgroups even without externally applying labelling of the nodes .",
    "citation networks are under causal constraints which impose some structure .",
    "we can see the effect of this structure by rewiring the edges of the network but maintaining the causal constraints .",
    "this is done by taking two edges , [ a , b ] and [ c , d ] and rewiring them to [ a , d ] and [ c , b ] if both of the new edges respect causality , thereby retaining the original in , and out degrees of each node and ensuring the network remains a dag .",
    "figure [ fig : hep - th_rewired ] shows that after all structure other than the causal constraints and in and out degree of each node in a network is removed , the dimension estimate plots give a significantly different result to the original ` hep - th ` network suggesting some other structure is involved in determining the estimated dimension and it is not an expected feature of a random network under the same constraints .",
    "edges have been rewired randomly @xmath28 times , so all structure other than the degree distribution and causality constraints has been removed.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ] edges have been rewired randomly @xmath28 times , so all structure other than the degree distribution and causality constraints has been removed.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]          here we further investigate the extent to which causal constraints and degree distribution determine estimated dimension with a simple null model .",
    "we generate a network with the same degree distribution as the ` quant - ph ` network using the simple cumulative attachment model for citations edges to existing nodes , where @xmath29 is the mean in degree in the network whose degree distribution we are replicating .",
    "with probability @xmath30 , edges attach preferentially , that is , proportionally to nodes according to their current in - degree , and with probability @xmath31 they attach randomly . by manually tuning @xmath30",
    ", we can create a network with a very similar degree distribution to a real citation network . in this instance , @xmath32 .",
    "] due to price @xcite and measure its dimension .",
    "figure  [ fig : ba ] shows that we can easily create a scale - free network with the same degree distribution as a citation network does not look the same according to these dimension estimates .",
    "citation networks from outside academia illustrate different behaviour .",
    "the us patent network s plot is much sparser for larger intervals , and almost all measured intervals were very small . for large intervals",
    "the measured dimension is around 5 , much larger than the arxiv citation networks .",
    "the plot for the us supreme court citation network has a different shape to all the others we investigated . in the arxiv and patent citation networks we see a slow growth in estimated dimension as interval size increases .",
    "the us supreme court network , figure  [ fig : ussc ] seems to show the opposite effect .",
    "small intervals have a higher dimension estimate , and dimension falls as interval size increases .",
    "our suggestion is that this effect is caused by this network stretching over an unusually long time period ( it covers all judgements made in the supreme court since 1754 ) . in the same way that a large",
    ", thin plane appears three - dimensional on length scales much smaller than the plane s thickness , but two dimensional on length scales much larger than this thickness , this network may also appears to have a different estimated dimension on different time scales .",
    "we also note that newer cases ( those with a larger case number on the colour bar ) have a lower measured dimension than older cases which is again the opposite trend to that in the arxiv citation networks .",
    "this temporal heterogeneity is another aspect of citation network structure which can be revealed by measuring dimension .      to find an interpretation for these results",
    ", we can look at simple examples of low , and high dimensional networks .",
    "a network with dimension 1 ( no spatial dimensions , just a time dimension ) would be a single line , where nodes form an unbroken chain of edges , each linking the previous node .    as the number of spatial dimensions grow it is more likely that two nodes do not have a causal relationship , and",
    "so do not link to each other .",
    "furthermore in any spatio - temporal model of citation networks the number of spatial dimensions corresponds to the number of coordinates required to parametrise a paper .",
    "it is appealing then to interpret a small dimensional citation network as a more narrow field , where most of the papers are causally related to most others , and any paper can be described by a small number of paramters , corresponding to a small number of different areas of study .",
    "a large dimension would then correspond to a more diverse field , where many independent authors can cite the same paper without citing each other and each paper requires a large number of parameters to be described .",
    "our high - dimensional networks , such as the astrophysics section of the arxiv can then be interpreted as being more diverse in terms of citation behaviour than high energy physics section , and patents more diverse than physics papers or court judgements .",
    "in this paper we have illustrated the effectiveness of manifold dimension estimates as novel ways of characterising networks which form dags , and in particular networks constrained by causality .",
    "we have shown that in citation networks , the midpoint - scaling dimension and myrheim - meyer dimension estimators show strong agreement and highlight important differences in the causal structure .",
    "for instance the two particle physics sections of arxiv , ` hep - th ` and ` hep - ph ` , are similar in many ways but clearly differ in the dimension measures which quantify how ` broad ' or ` narrow ' the citation behaviour of authors in these fields is .",
    "furthermore , these methods can be used as a way of differentiating citation networks .",
    "given two intervals , one from the ` hep - th ` network , and the other from ` hep - ph ` we can estimate their dimensions using these methods and we could deduce which section of the arxiv those papers came from , without knowing their authors or content , using only the topology of the citation network .",
    "the message here is that citation networks from different areas of study have measurably different citation behaviours , and that this is potentially useful information we can extract which is potentially of interest to any scientists who want to improve their use of bibliometric measures as an aid to research .",
    "the dimension of a general network is a concept which has been considered before , with differing meanings ; for example the number of parameters in a model @xcite , the time a random walker takes to return to its starting position @xcite , fractal box counting dimension in euclidean space @xcite , or the number spatial ( but not temporal ) dimensions measured using influence regions @xcite .",
    "however causal constraints are a key feature of citation networks and dags and it is essential that such a constraint is taken into account when analysing these networks @xcite .",
    "this is why it was important to develop methods which include time as dimension which is not the same as the spatial dimensions .",
    "the dimension measures we use explicitly involve time and take the the causal constraints of citation networks into account , recognising that in - edges ( being cited ) and out - edges ( citing someone else ) are fundamentally different things . while in a purely spatial embedding of a network , one might reasonably suggest that the probability of an edge existing between two nodes will always increase if the distance between them decreases , this is not necessarily the case in time .",
    "the information in one paper takes time to reach other researchers , and this delay is larger if researchers work in separate field .    in the arxiv citation network , we found that the time difference of a citation between two papers in the same arxiv subsection was 1.6 years , and for papers in different subsections 2.1 years , suggesting that citations to papers which are less similar ( or further away in some abstract spatial representation ) are more likely to span larger time intervals , reflecting the finite speed of information propagation .",
    "the primary reason for our choice of minkowski spacetime for these dimension estimates over some other spacetime is that it is one of the simplest choices to make , defined by a single parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the scope of this work was to characterise different network structures by measuring spacetime dimension and not to find an actual embedding of the network into that spacetime by assigning coordinates to each point .",
    "this would be much more difficult to do for spacetimes which are described by more than just one parameter ( eg . for curved spacetimes ) . for studies of networks embedded in other types of space , for causal sets",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and for growing network models in hyperbolic spaces to @xcite .",
    "there are suggestions in the literature , that it may be possible to find better correspondences between particular networks and spaces .",
    "the de sitter spacetime studied in @xcite can give the same fat - tailed citation distribution as the simple price model @xcite but the development of other network measures is needed before we can truly say that there is a correspondence between citation networks and these kinds of spaces . indeed , using other causally aware measures on citation data",
    "reveals important new features in real citation network data @xcite which are not present in generic preferential attachment models .",
    "one particular feature noted in @xcite is that only small number of papers published shortly before the referencing paper are needed to define the causal structure of a real citation network .",
    "these are the essential links , i.e. the citations left after transitive reduction .",
    "we note that other dimension estimators exist for networks embedded in minkowski spaces .",
    "we have tried using the reduced degree , but as explained in the appendix it is not a feasible method .",
    "a recently published method not implemented here , but potentially appropriate for citation networks uses a random walker on a causal set to estimate it s spectral dimension@xcite .",
    "however many other methods are inappropriate for analysis of the causal structure of a citation network .",
    "one such method is to find the smallest dimension in which any subgraph can be faithfully embedded @xcite .",
    "this method requires a dag to be perfectly embedded in a manifold as just one subgraph which can not be embeddable in @xmath0 dimensions means that the entire network is given a dimension higher than @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , there are some finite dags which can not be perfectly embedded in a minkowski space of any dimension @xcite .",
    "these methods are less appropriate for analysis of our citation networks , since the ( integer ) result such dimension estimates give can be increased by one by the rewiring of only one edge , which is an unhelpful property when dealing with noisy real - world data , or it may not even be defined at all .    conversely the two estimates we use here are robust to noise , a useful property when analysing data from social interactions",
    ". they produce a real number value and and small deviations from dags which are faithfully embedded in a minkowski manifold only lead to small deviations in the estimated dimension .",
