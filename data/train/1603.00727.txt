    "lechner and dellago @xcite have introduced a second neighbor averaged @xmath27 that reduces noise , and is a suitable order parameter for our investigation . in modified version , after @xmath75 is calculated , the values are again averaged over with all particles and their neigbors , which gives @xmath78 the final average @xmath27 is in the form @xmath79^{1/2}.\\ ] ]    after comparing different @xmath76 values , we found @xmath7 with a next - to - nearest - neighbor average gave the best order - parametric separation of our structures of interest .",
    "we chose a cutoff based on the number of nearest neighbors , rather than a cutoff distance , because we found @xmath7 for different cutoff distances was highly sensitive to the thermal noise , inherent in our systems .",
    "the basic idea of umbrella sampling @xcite is to divide the order parameter space ( here , @xmath7 ) into different state points ( windows ) and apply a biased potential to the system that favors the target state point . to sample the system we computed the biased energy for the target state point every 50 unbiased > 0mc=0monte carlo ( mc )  sweeps and apply a metropolis criterion to decide whether to accept or reject the series of moves .",

    "the identification of thermodynamic phase transitions can be done using either the ehrenfest ( constitutive relation ) or landau ( free energy ) approaches . here , we have chosen to compute landau free energies using umbrella sampling as described above ; however , we would like to contrast our approach with an ehrenfest approach , _",
    "e.g. _  computing pressure as a function of shape space .    as a shorthand",
    ", we will refer to the constitutive relationship @xmath96 , defined and computed in @xcite , as the `` equation of shape '' because like @xmath97 it relates state variables of stress and strain , but in the alchemical space of shapes .",
    "usually thermodynamic phase transitions in systems of hard colloids are considered as a function of packing fraction @xcite so that the equation of state is the quantity of interest . here ,",
    "we are interested in phase transitions at fixed packing fraction that occur as a function of shape , meaning that the equation of shape is the quantity of interest . in order to identify and classify `` alchemical '' phase transitions using the ehrenfest approach",
    "one must compute high precision equations of shape near the critical @xmath98 . to get",
    "a high precision equation of shape in this region would be difficult , particularly if the transition is first order .",
    "if the transition is first order , the equation of shape is multivalued near @xmath99 . for @xmath100",
    ", @xmath101 receives two contributions , one from the metastable structure , and one from the stable structure , with the final value of @xmath101 arising as a weighted sum of the contributions from the two structures . determining the relative weight of the various contributions would require lattice switch @xcite or other advanced sampling methods .",
    "however , for finite sized systems near @xmath99 the difference in free energy between competing phases would become vanishingly small , making the computation expensive .    in passing , however , we note that the lattice switch method @xcite could be used to obtain high precision estimates of @xmath99 that do not suffer from the systematic errors arising in umbrella sampling that are described in sec.[sec : err ] above . in the present study ,",
    "we were principally interested in determining the thermodynamic nature of shape - driven phase transitions , rather than precisely locating the critical shapes .",

    "<S> we investigate the pressure  shape constitutive relation @xmath3 ( fig .  </S>",

    "<S> experiments have demonstrated systems with changeable building block shape , either directly @xcite or effectively with depletion @xcite . here , within a two parameter model family of highly symmetric hard colloidal polyhedra , we found examples of building - block shape change driven structural reconfiguration that were accompanied by first - order phase transitions , and those that were not accompanied by any thermodynamic phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> this disparity in behavior is surprising not only because it occurs within a single family of model colloids , but also because of the way > 0bcc=0body - centered cubic ( bcc )  and > 0fcc=0face - centered cubic ( fcc ) , and > 0bcc=0body - centered cubic ( bcc )  and > 0sc=0simple cubic ( sc ) , are related . </S>",
    "<S> whereas the mathematical transformation relating > 0bcc=0body - centered cubic ( bcc )  and > 0fcc=0face - centered cubic ( fcc )  is simply elongation in one direction @xcite , > 0bcc=0body - centered cubic ( bcc )  and > 0sc=0simple cubic ( sc )  are related by a transformation that involves shearing particles within the unit cell @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the transformation between structures that is mathematically simpler to define is more difficult to achieve thermodynamically . hence thermodynamically accessible </S>",
    "<S> crystal  crystal reconfiguration need not have a simple mathematical definition , nor , vice versa , does mathematical simplicity mean the reconfiguration pathway is easier . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , we also find that in contrast to what happens for hard spheres confined between parallel plates , crystal  crystal reconfiguration need not go though an intermediate fluid state @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our investigation also shows that the role of colloid shape is more subtle than simple consideration of a particle s point group symmetry because we see different thermodynamic behavior for different structural reconfiguration even though all particles share the same point group symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that particles that are self - dual ( _ i.e. _  those for which @xmath12 ) show the same pattern of behavior as particles that are not self dual ( see > 0appendix=0appendix  for complete analysis ) . our results suggesting that the role of colloid shape is more subtle than simple symmetry considerations accord well with prior work showing that bulk structure depends on not just the symmetry of shape features , but also on feature size and system density @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that using shape to reconfigure between two structures is viable , but that reconfiguration among more than two structures would be difficult . </S>",
    "<S> first , for reconfiguration between two structures , our results suggest that , for well - chosen building blocks and bulk structures , crystal  crystal reconfiguration can occur without a thermodynamic phase transition ( see fig.[result2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the absence of a thermodynamic phase transition suggests that thermal fluctuations could drive reconfiguring building blocks to transition between structures dynamically , and we observed this dynamical transition in simulation . </S>",
    "<S> it is unlikely that our example of > 0bcc=0body - centered cubic ( bcc)@xmath4>0sc=0simple cubic ( sc ) reconfiguration is the only case of structural reconfiguration that occurs without a thermodynamic phase transition , so our results suggest that further investigation should search for other such examples .    </S>",
    "<S> second , our findings suggest two types of possible limitations on reconfiguring between more than two structures . </S>",
    "<S> ( i ) our results on > 0bcc=0body - centered cubic ( bcc)@xmath4>0sc=0simple cubic ( sc ) reconfiguration show that structural reconfiguration occurs without a thermodynamic phase transition over a range of building block shapes associated with intermediate structures , rather than as a sharp crossover . </S>",
    "<S> this means that significant building block shape change is required to achieve a complete structural reconfiguration from one phase to the other if there is no sharp transition . </S>",
    "<S> if this finding is generic , it suggests that reconfiguration without a phase transition between more than two structures is limited because structural crossovers would be widely separated in the space of building block shapes . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) in contrast , though we found a sharp crossover for the first - order > 0bcc=0body - centered cubic ( bcc)@xmath4>0fcc=0face - centered cubic ( fcc ) transition , our @xmath3 and umbrella sampling results show that even in the event of a sharp crossover , metastable phases persist deep into regions of parameter space in which other phases are dominant ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ result1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this means that even when structural reconfiguration is accompanied by a sharp thermodynamic transition , significant building block reconfiguration is required to achieve structural reconfiguration dynamically . </S>",
    "<S> if this result is generic , it suggests that structural reconfiguration would be difficult to achieve in systems that have parametrically nearby sharp transitions because intermediate bulk structures might be kinetically inaccessible .    finally , the physics of crystral  crystal phase transitions in metals , e.g.between @xmath54-fe ( > 0fcc=0face - centered cubic ( fcc ) ) and @xmath55-fe ( > 0bcc=0body - centered cubic ( bcc ) ) @xcite , is of longstanding interest . </S>",
    "<S> though the present work was motivated by the development of functional soft materials , recent work @xcite has shown that colloidal systems allow unprecedentedly detailed investigations of the basic physics of crystal  crystal reconfiguration . </S>",
    "<S> our example systems of shape - driven crystal  crystal reconfiguration provide particularly clean examples of colloidal systems that reconfigure without the need for external fields , and have the potential to further the understanding of structural transitions in metals , where transitions can be insensitive to atomic details @xcite .    </S>",
