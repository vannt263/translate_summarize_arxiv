    "therefore , the polarization of the photon carries information on the original @xmath12 flavor and the time - dependent @xmath1 asymmetry is suppressed by the quark mass ratio ( @xmath13 )  @xcite . in several models beyond the sm , the photon acquires an appreciable right - handed component due to the exchange of a virtual heavy fermion in the loop process , resulting in large values of mixing - induced @xmath1 asymmetries .",
    "the same argument holds in any multibody final states @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are charge - conjugate states  @xcite ( e.g. , @xmath3 , @xmath17 )  @xcite .",
    "a non - zero value of @xmath1 asymmetry will be a clear hint of new physics .",
    "the belle detector is a large - solid - angle magnetic spectrometer that consists of a silicon vertex detector ( svd ) , a 50-layer central drift chamber ( cdc ) , an array of aerogel threshold cherenkov counters ( acc ) , a barrel - like arrangement of time - of - flight scintillation counters ( tof ) , and an electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecl ) comprised of csi(tl ) crystals located inside a superconducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5  t magnetic field .",
    "an iron flux - return located outside the coil is instrumented to detect @xmath18 mesons and to identify muons ( klm ) . the detector is described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
