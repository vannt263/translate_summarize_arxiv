    "spacetimes are typically characterized by a choice of coordinates and a metric .",
    "if the coordinates are poorly chosen however many properties of the spacetime such as horizons , causally connected spacetime points , null infinity and maximal extensions are not readily apparent .",
    "one way to surmount these difficulties is to perform conformal transformations leading to penrose diagrams .",
    "these diagrams are quite useful and successful especially in understanding causal structure although there are some limitations to this approach .",
    "for instance just knowing the penrose diagram for the subextremal @xmath4 reissner - nordstrm black hole does not tell us what happens to the spacetime structure in the chargeless or extremal limits .",
    "also the penrose diagram for a kerr black hole does not clearly describe the ring singularity and the possibility of crossing through the ring into a second universe .",
    "recently , analytic continuation has been applied to black hole solutions to yield bubble - type @xcite or s - brane @xcite solutions .",
    "oftentimes this is done in boyer - lindquist type coordinates which are hard to visualize .",
    "again we are not left with a clear picture of the resulting spacetime and the penrose diagrams are missing important noncompact spatial directions . for more complicated spacetimes , penrose diagrams ( which usually assume symmetry ) can only draw a slice of the spacetime",
    ".    it would be useful to have an alternative diagram which could also capture other important features of a spacetime .",
    "for this reason in this paper we expand the notion of drawing spacetimes in weyl space @xcite",
    ". the idea will be to draw only weyl s canonical coordinates ( or coordinates related to them via a conformal transformation ) and not killing coordinates .    in @xmath5 dimensions a weyl solution in canonical",
    "coordinates @xcite is written as    ds^2=-f dt^2+f^-1[e^2(d^2+dz^2)+^2 d^2 ]     where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are functions of @xmath8 .",
    "although only solutions with enough symmetry ( two orthogonal commuting killing fields @xmath9 in four dimensions , or @xmath10 fields for general @xmath11 dimensions ) can be written in these coordinates , it is quite useful to consider the weyl type ansatz as many of the well known solutions can be written in the above form .",
    "weyl s symmetry requirement of @xmath10 orthogonal commuting killing vectors in @xmath11 dimensions @xcite , is a quite large and interesting class of gravitational solutions .",
    "we also include the weyl - papapetrou class for 2 commuting killing vectors in @xmath5 @xcite , and allow charged static solutions in @xmath12 ( see the appendix to this paper ) .",
    "furthermore stationary vacuum solutions in @xmath13 are covered with the very recent work of @xcite and axisymmetric spacetimes in @xmath12 are discussed in @xcite . in four and five dimensions this general ` weyl ' class includes spinning charged black holes as well as various arrays@xcite of black holes , s - branes , and includes backgrounds like melvin fluxbranes@xcite and spinning ergotubes .",
    "one of the main goals of this paper will be to devise a procedure to obtain a sensible singly covered diagram to exhibit the features of these spacetimes .",
    "a key point is that weyl solutions depend on only two coordinates and so are amenable to the construction of easy - to - visualize two dimensional diagrams .",
    "these diagrams will be reminiscent of a pasting - together of playing cards , and so we call these card diagrams .",
    "card diagrams are efficient in the sense that they show only the non - killing directions and so it is easy to see the important features of any weyl spacetime .    in this paper rather than focusing on one geometry or family of geometries",
    ", we discuss techniques which generate a host of weyl spacetimes and briefly discuss their features .",
    "many new spacetimes are presented in the current paper and more will be presented in an ensuing paper @xcite .    in section 2",
    "we construct a card diagram for the schwarzschild black hole as an example before giving a general discussion of the card diagrams properties .",
    "card diagrams not only allow us to visualize the spacetime and instantly see much of its structure , but are also helpful in performing and keeping track of analytic continuations .",
    "the card diagrams for the s - branes@xcite which we will call s - schwarzschild@xcite and s - kerr are markedly different from their schwarzschild and kerr counterparts . in comparison",
    "the penrose diagram for these s - branes does not emphasize a difference and are @xmath14 rotations of the black hole penrose diagrams .",
    "card diagrams will draw noncompact hyperbolic @xmath15-directions in s - brane geometries which provides a different perspective of their properties . examining the witten bubble and s - brane analytic continuations",
    "we also find that a spacetime may have more than one card diagram due to the different killing congruences one may choose for a spacetime .",
    "the weyl ansatz ( and its wick rotations ) depends on two variables and is well suited for describing the decay of localized unstable branes .",
    "homogeneous unstable brane decay also depends on two variables , time and the distance from the object .",
    "such solutions in this paper relevant to the decay of unstable objects appear in section 3 , which includes a discussion of new s - brane solutions which are analytic continuations@xcite of diholes@xcite .",
    "these solutions are certainly interesting in their own right , although they also serve here as good examples of how weyl cards can simplify the understanding of a complicated spacetime s global properties . in general ,",
    "card diagrams are indispensable for creating and quickly examining new weyl spacetimes .",
    "these solutions describe the formation and decay of unstable objects including melvin type universes and cones . also noteworthy",
    "is that some of these solutions include near horizon scaling limits , and some are related to the cosmological solutions of @xcite .",
    "generalizations to larger array solutions @xcite are discussed in section 4 and these solutions may play a role in understanding unstable brane decay@xcite .    in section 5 we return to discuss many well known black hole and s - brane solutions including the reissner - nordstrm black hole , kerr , the five dimensional black ring solution of @xcite , s0-branes , twisted s - branes@xcite , the c - metric and new s - black ring and two - rod wave solutions .",
    "as examples , the card diagram for the reissner - nordstrm black hole makes more evident how the chargeless and extremal limits take place .",
    "in addition it will be useful to extend the card diagram past curvature singularities ; positive- and negative - mass universes can be pasted together in a satisfying way .",
    "also , the card diagram for the kerr black hole shows a manifest symmetry between inner and outer ergospheres , and presents a clearer picture of the spacetime near the ring singularity as compared to the penrose diagram or the kerr - schild picture .",
    "solutions based on two rods are also discussed in section 6 including a new five dimensional non - nakedly singular s - brane solution .",
    "we conclude with discussion and an appendix on how the higher dimensional vacuum weyl ansatz can be extended to include electro - magnetic fields .",
    "in this section we construct our first card diagrams and list some of their general properties .    as a useful first example in this section we examine the schwarzschild black hole and the construction of its card diagram before discussing some general properties of card diagrams in detail . up to now if a solution had horizons , then only the exterior regions outside the horizons in weyl coordinates have been drawn . to go through horizons we complexify",
    "the weyl coordinates .",
    "although asking what is inside a horizon naively leads to multiply covered coordinate triangles we discuss the construction of a singly covered extension .",
    "there are several key steps in constructing the diagrams : we will discuss how to adjoin the cards representing the exterior of a horizon to its interior , how to extend past `` null lines '' where the weyl coordinates are problematic and how to deal with branch points on the cards .",
    "note that weyl diagrams are also a way to picture the space on which we solve the laplace / dalembert equation to find a metric ; the schwarzschild black hole is a uniform rod source .",
    "these card diagrams in other words will represent a full accounting of the boundary conditions necessary to specify the spacetime .",
    "horizontal cards , where the spacetime is stationary , will be used for regions where we solve for the laplace equation while the new time dependent vertical cards will be where we solve the wave equation .",
    "then we will describe the effect of analytic continuation on the card diagrams by examining two known analytic continuations of schwarzschild , the witten bubble of nothing@xcite , and the s0-brane@xcite which we also call s - schwarzschild@xcite .",
    "we discover that a spacetime may have more than one card diagram representation and that these solutions related by seemingly different analytic continuation have a simple and interesting relationship in weyl space .",
    "our first example of a concrete card diagram is the schwarzschild black hole which is possibly the most well studied four dimensional gravitational solution . in this section",
    "we will describe the construction of its weyl card diagram .",
    "the penrose diagram and the weyl card diagram for schwarzschild are compared in fig .",
    "[ penrose - weyl - comparison ] .",
    "the schwarzschild metric written in the usual spherically symmetric ( boyer - lindquist or bl ) coordinates is @xmath16 there is a horizon at @xmath17 and a curvature singularity at @xmath18 .",
    "it is not difficult to also write this solution in weyl s canonical coordinates @xcite as @xmath19 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are functions of the coordinates @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xmath22 the half - plane @xmath23 , @xmath24 , known as weyl space , describes the exterior of the schwarzschild black hole , whose horizon is represented by a source on the line segment @xmath25 , @xmath26 , see fig .  [ weylrod ] .",
    "note that a solution slice restricted to the two dimensions of weyl space , is conformal to the euclidean @xmath27 .",
    "the coordinate transformation between bl and weyl coordinates is @xmath28    now we wish to ask how weyl s coordinates draw the spacetime inside the horizon .",
    "the bl coordinates ( [ coordinatetrans ] ) tell us that for @xmath29 , @xmath20 is imaginary and so we set @xmath30 @xmath31 ( in general we must perform an analytic continuation of weyl coordinates to go through a horizon which are at the zeros of the weyl functions @xmath32 . )",
    "the analytic continuation begins a region with a conformally minkowskian metric @xmath33 and we will draw this region as being vertical and attached to the horizontal card at the horizon @xmath26",
    ". the vertical direction is always timelike in card diagrams .",

    "coordinates we also have a similar structure since we can also perform the analytic continuation to a second vertical region @xmath36 and then to a second horizontal region at negative real @xmath20 .",
    "so we put another copy of the horizontal external universe behind the horizon and another copy of the vertical region below ( see figure  [ buildcard2 ] ) for a total of a four card junction similar to the penrose diagram .",
    "the four regions labelled h1 , h2 , v1 and v2 in    the penrose diagram map to the similarly labelled region on the card diagram in fig .",
    "[ penrose - weyl - comparison ] .",
    "note however that the weyl cards we are building represent the @xmath37 coordinates of the schwarzschild solution which is different from the penrose diagram .",
    "however the fact that the radial coordinate @xmath38 describes four distinct regions , two where @xmath39 is spacelike and two where it is timelike , is still apparent in the weyl card diagram .",
    "let us next examine what the ( upper ) vertical card looks like .",
    "looking at an @xmath38-orbit on the vertical card , we note that @xmath40 .",
    "these bounding lines are where we have a zero of @xmath41 , which we call special null lines and they are        a general feature of vertical cards with focal points ( the rod endpoints @xmath42 on the schwarzschild card ) . here",
    "the null lines are the envelope of the @xmath38-orbits as we vary @xmath15 .",
    "thus when inside the horizon the bl coordinates apparently fill out a vertical 45 - 45 - 90 degree triangle in weyl coordinates with hypotenuse length @xmath43 as shown in figure  [ 4xcoverfig ] .",
    "special null lines play an important role in weyl card diagrams so let us explain their significance .",
    "keep in mind that we have already broken the manifest spherical symmetry when we have written schwarzschild in weyl coordinates , so the existence of preferred special null lines is relative to this chosen axis . in boyer - lindquist coordinates , we want to look at the vanishing of [ blr ] r_=r - mm . as drawn in fig .",
    "[ cardioids ] , the 3-surfaces @xmath44 have a cardioid shape . for a given axis",
    "there are two , and these surfaces intersect at @xmath45 and partition the inside - horizon into four subregions .",
    "these regions will correspond to four triangles which we describe below and the null lines correspond to the above 3-surfaces . at any point in the diagram ,",
    "two axes may be chosen and cardioids drawn to bound the future trajectories of null or timelike curves .",
    "it is clear from ( [ blr ] ) that @xmath46 is positive outside the horizon and there is no difficulty going to negative values inside the horizon . on the other hand in terms of weyl coordinates , the functions @xmath41 are the square root of a positive number when @xmath47 and the function is imaginary if we naively cross the null line . as we will discuss in more detail , the difficulty in weyl coordinates is actually that we initially use the positive    branch of the square root , but as the radicand passes through zero , we must switch branches of the square root function .",
    "this is just the statement that the function @xmath48 can be continued through @xmath49 to negative values . to obtain a proper weyl description of the schwarzschild solution",
    "it is necessary to extend the spacetime past the null lines .",
    "the resolution is that we may continue to use the coordinates @xmath50 on the same triangle @xmath51 to describe the interior of the black hole but with two important details .",
    "one is that every time though we cross a special null line we change the sign of @xmath52 or @xmath53 depending on which line we cross .",
    "the     and height @xmath54 .",
    "the interior is covered four times by orbits of @xmath38 at four different values of @xmath15.,width=245 ]    second is that the coordinates cover only a portion of the interior and we must properly glue these coordinate patches together to fill out the entire region inside the horizon .",
    "so for example the horizon and the singularity are both described as being at @xmath55 but the metric near the singularity will have all instances of @xmath46 replaced by @xmath56 .    to understand this resolution",
    "let us return to the coordinate map .",
    "an analysis of eq .",
    "[ coordinatetrans2 ] shows that the bl coordinates cover the same triangle four times and we depict this in figure  [ 4xcoverfig ] . of note",
    "is the fact that an @xmath38-orbit which initially is timelike ( upward ) on the vertical card turns seemingly spacelike ( leftward ) after touching the special null line , while in fact it should always be timelike .",
    "therefore this naive extrapolation of weyl coordinates into the horizon is not accurate .    a very simple and visually appealing solution to this problem exists .",
    "all difficulties with the coordinates can be fixed by simply unfolding the four copies of the triangle across the special null lines to produce a square of length @xmath43 .",
    "for example this will turn the bottom triangular region on its side as shown in fig .",
    "[ buildcard6 ] by the left and right triangles .",
    "in addition to extending the coordinates , we must also properly extend the metric across the null lines so the metric in the different triangles corresponds to different spacetime points .",
    "the first unfolding , drawn down to @xmath45 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ buildcard5 ] , and the end result with the manifestly timelike @xmath38-orbits , drawn all the way to @xmath18 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ buildcard6 ] . in the schwarzschild geometry it is possible to explicitly see that @xmath57 changes sign when we change the overall sign of one of the @xmath58 in weyl coordinates .",
    "changing the sign of @xmath57 as we pass the null lines is the way to properly unfold the coordinate triangles because it interchanges which of the the @xmath59 coordinates is timelike and which is spacelike .",
    "note that @xmath7 is therefore not necessarily real and its imaginary part can be either @xmath60 or @xmath61 .",
    "also because of the unfolding of the triangles , the positive @xmath21-direction on the top triangle horizontal cards points in the opposite direction compared to on the original horizontal card",
    ".    the vertical cards for the schwarzschild black hole are thus both squares of length @xmath43 .",
    "the bottom of the upper card v1 is the black hole horizon which connects to three other cards in a four card junction .",
    "the right and left sides of this vertical card at @xmath62 are boundaries where the @xmath63-circle vanishes .",
    "the top edge of the card at @xmath18 is the black hole curvature singularity .",
    "[ buildcard6 ] depicts the region @xmath64 on the upper vertical card .",
    "the second vertical card is build in analogous fashion except the square is built in a downwards fashion towards negative values of @xmath65 .",
    "also there is a second horizontal card plane identical to the first attached to the same horizon .",
    "we have now described how to build the card diagram for the schwarzschild black hole in figure  [ penrose - weyl - comparison ] .",
    "one would ordinarily stop the construction of schwarzschild with the above four regions , but for reasons which become more clear when we look at the reissner - nordstrm and kerr black holes in sections  [ rnsubsub ] and [ kerrsubsec ] , we continue the spacetime past the singularity to attach two horizontal half - plane corresponding to negative - mass universes , and another vertical card above . in schwarzschild coordinates ,",
    "these negative - mass universes represent @xmath66 nakedly singular spacetimes .",
    "each negative mass - universe is one horizontal half - plane card with a singularity along @xmath26 .",
    "the total card diagram for schwarzschild is an infinite stack of cards representing positive and negative mass universes and the inside - horizon regions , shown in fig .",
    "[ fullschwarzcardfig ] .",
    "having described the construction of the card diagram for schwarzschild we now turn to a few general remarks about these diagrams .",

    ". vertical cards are always conformally minkowskian and represent regions with ( @xmath10 ) spacelike killing fields . on a vertical card time",
    "is always in the vertical direction and causal cones lie between the @xmath67 angles .",
    "weyl s coordinates certainly go bad at horizons , so these diagrams are not a full replacement for penrose diagrams at understanding causal structure or particle trajectories .",
    "however , it is clear for example from fig .",
    "[ fullschwarzcardfig ] that two vertical and two horizontal cards attach together in a @xmath68-configuration in precisely the sense of the @xmath35-like horizon structure of the penrose diagram .",
    "the prototypical horizon is that of the two rindler and two milne wedges of flat space ; this spacetime has two horizontal half - plane cards and two vertical half plane cards that meet along the horizon being the whole @xmath21-axis . zooming in on a non - extremal horizon of any card diagram yields this rindler / milne picture .",
    "a rod endpoint @xmath69 such as @xmath42 for schwarzschild is a ` focus ' for the weyl diagram and often represents the end of a black hole or acceleration horizon on a horizontal card . quite generally ,",
    "multi - black hole weyl spacetimes depend only on distances to foci @xcite .    to understand that it is natural in general to change the branch of the functions @xmath70 when crossing the special null line that emanates from the foci at @xmath71 , take some weyl spacetime and imagine moving upwards in a vertical card to meet the special null line at @xmath72 by increasing time @xmath73 for fixed spatial @xmath21 . rearranging @xmath74 as the semi - ellipse @xmath75 we see that a smooth traversal of this semi - ellipse across @xmath72 requires a change in the sign of @xmath70 .    in many of our solutions ,",
    "special null lines are used to reflect vertical triangular cards to create full , rectangular cards .",
    "however , in the bonnor - transformed s - dihole ii geometry of sec .",
    "[ sdihole - sec ] as well as double killing rotated extremal geometries and parabolic representations of the bubble and s - schwarzschild in sec.[thirdcard - poincare ] , the special null lines will serve as conformal null infinity @xmath76 .",
    "boundaries of cards indicate where killing circles vanish .",
    "which circle vanishes is constant over a connected piece of the boundary , even when the boundary turns a right angle onto a vertical card .",
    "furthermore the periodicity to eliminate conical singularities is constant along connected parts of the boundary . for the schwarzschild ,",
    "the @xmath63-circle vanishes on both the connected boundaries and has periodicity @xmath77 .",
    "when a light ray is incident from a horizontal card onto a horizon ( to enter the upper vertical card ) , it must turn and meet that horizon perpendicularly .",
    "it then appears on the vertical card , again perpendicular to the horizon . only those light rays which go from the lower vertical card to the upper vertical card",
    "directly can meet the horizon line at a non - right angle ; these rays would touch the vertex of the @xmath35 in a penrose diagram such as in the schwarzschild case .",
    "when a light ray on a vertical card hits a boundary where a spacelike circle vanishes , it bounces back at the same angle as drawn on the card .",
    "spacetimes with a symmetry group larger than the minimal weyl symmetry can have more than one card diagram representation .",
    "this is due to the fact that there can be more than one way to set up a killing congruence on the spacetime manifold which is still compatible with the weyl ansatz .",
    "examples we explicitly discuss in sec .",
    "[ bubble - sbrane - subsec ] are the 4d witten bubble and the 4d s - reissner - nordstrm ( s - rn ) which have three card diagrams corresponding to the three types of killing congruences on ds@xmath78 or @xmath79 ; secs .",

    "different representations have different uses .",

    "all spacetimes , new and old , in this paper are built from the following card types .",
    "horizontal cards are always half - planes .",
    "they may however have one or more branch cuts which may be taken to run perpendicular to the @xmath21-axis .",
    "undoing one branch cut leads to a strip with two boundaries ; multiple branch cuts lead to some open subset , with boundary , of a riemann surface .",

    "there are no five dimensional analogues of the hyperbolic s - rn and hyperbolic superextremal e - rn ( see next subsection ) card diagrams .",
    "for all these solutions , the lack of a third card diagram in the five dimensional case can be understood from two different perspectives : the lack of a @xmath101 continuation in the weyl functions @xmath692 , @xmath693 ; or the restrictions on orthogonal congruences of @xmath668 .      although it is not clear if e - brane solutions @xcite should exist in a stable theory , they are interesting simple examples of new card diagrams .",

    "let us label the killing directions as @xmath104 ( time ) , @xmath63 ( space ) in that order and label a boundary by @xmath755 where as @xmath756 , the metric component @xmath757 and @xmath758 . by definition",
    "we have the relation @xmath759 . in this scheme",
    "a horizon is @xmath760 , an ordinary boundary where the weyl card ends is @xmath761 , and a schwarzschild black hole singularity is @xmath762 .",
    "next we specify a background boundary which is of type @xmath761 along the @xmath21-axis of the weyl card . on top of this place a rod from @xmath26 of schwarzschild type @xmath763 and a second rod of type @xmath763 from @xmath764 .",
    "these sources generate @xmath765 where @xmath766 and @xmath767 .",
    "turn the second rod on its side by the analytic continuation @xmath768 , @xmath769 , @xmath770 , @xmath110 which is like the one used for the hyperbolic representation of s - rn .",
    "the function @xmath771 is negative , the coordinate @xmath104 is timelike and the solution is ready to become a charged s - brane upon imaginary-@xmath772 electrification , see appendix  [ electrify - app ] .",
    "denoting @xmath773 , the solution has @xmath774 the function @xmath775 is real as can be checked .",
    "the effect of turning the rod on its side is to induce a branch point at @xmath776 . fixing this branch point by taking the appropriate square root",
    ", we find two boundaries , labelled @xmath68 and @xmath777 , which are the images of the @xmath21-axis on the horizontal card .",
    "the @xmath68 boundary is uniformly affected by @xmath763 and the @xmath777 boundary is uniformly affected by @xmath778 .",
    "this makes the @xmath68 boundary a sequence , of horizon @xmath779 , singularity @xmath780 , and horizon @xmath779 from left to right .",
    "the @xmath777 boundary is @xmath762 , @xmath761 , @xmath762 .",
    "let us recall two solution generating techniques .",
    "there is a ` sign flip ' procedure which is applicable to four dimensional vacuum weyl solutions where @xmath781 in israel - khan solutions , this replaces rods with space and space with rods . when rods are rotated parallel to imaginary @xmath21 , the interpretation is less clear .",
    "the sign flip sends @xmath782 .",
    "another technique is harrison s third theorem @xcite which sends @xmath783 where @xmath784 is real .",
    "this changes the order of @xmath6 s vanishing near @xmath25 uniformly at all boundaries .    performing the sign flip ( [ signflip ] ) and",
    "then harrison s third theorem with @xmath785 on our solution gives a @xmath777 boundary of orders @xmath779 , @xmath761 , @xmath779 , and a @xmath68 boundary of orders @xmath762 , @xmath786 , @xmath762 .",
    "the @xmath68 boundary has two schwarzschild singularities and a bad singularity where @xmath787 . in the case of the schwarzschild and s - schwarzschild solutions",
    ", we saw that singularities can be moved / created by adding charge . here",
    "we change the singularities by imaginary-@xmath772 electrification . setting @xmath788",
    ", we get a rn singularity wherever @xmath789 . for large enough positive @xmath772 , the rn singularity then hugs the @xmath68 boundary and leaves the rest of the universe ( with witten bubble horizons on the @xmath777 boundary ) connected .",
    "the card diagram is shown in figure  [ 4d-2rods ] .",
    "= 3.5 in      there are three basic rod configurations which give topological - line horizons and topological - line singularities .",
    "all of these configurations involve branch cuts from the boundary of the @xmath790 half - plane out to a branch point in the interior of the card .",
    "first , place a horizontal rod from @xmath791 to @xmath792 , and place a mirror rod from @xmath793 to @xmath794 .",
    "branch points now occur ( for the distances @xmath795 to the upper rod endpoints , and their conjugates ) at @xmath42 , @xmath796 , and the standard square root branch cut gives us branch cuts along @xmath42 , @xmath797 .",
    "undoing the two branch cuts gives @xmath798 boundaries ( which may be horizons , singularities , or true boundaries where a circle vanishes ) .",
    "second , place a vertical rod from @xmath799 to @xmath800 and a mirror rod from @xmath801 to @xmath802 .",
    "there are branch points at @xmath109 , @xmath803 and @xmath804 .",
    "one branch cut runs out to @xmath803 and an independent branch cut runs out to @xmath804 . again undoing the branch cuts gives four boundaries .",
    "third , place a vertical rod from @xmath805 to @xmath806 like the second representation of s - schwarzschild .",
    "if we place two such rods , one displaced from along real @xmath21 , we get two branch cuts and four boundaries .    the orientations of rods ( reversing the sign of some @xmath54 s ) and branches to all endpoints can be considered ; there will always be some solution for @xmath317 which is real and involves the real logarithm . for brevity this will not be spelled out .    in all cases",
    ", rods must be given density @xmath728 ( sourcing @xmath317 ) to generate a @xmath7 such that @xmath57 blows up to order 1 at the branch point .",
    "this is necessary to get a nonsingular spacetime after conformally fixing the branches on the horizontal card . for the hyperbolic s - schwarzschild , we know that a single rod generates a horizon ( where @xmath733 vanishes @xmath807 ) , and a singularity ( where @xmath6 blows up @xmath808 ) . for that case",
    "we had @xmath809 where @xmath810 .",
    "for the cases of two rods , each boundary has a @xmath428 status relative to each rod .",
    "the @xmath811 boundary has @xmath812 , a @xmath813 or @xmath814 boundary has @xmath815 , and the @xmath816 boundary has @xmath817 .",
    "so for the third case of two vertical - in-@xmath21 rods crossing the @xmath21-axis , not continuing killing directions , we have @xmath818 where each @xmath819 , @xmath820 is negative .",
    "we perform the sign flip ( [ signflip ] ) . here , this gives @xmath821 on the @xmath811 , @xmath813 , @xmath814 , @xmath816 boundaries .",
    "this is ready to be turned into a charged s - brane solution via a real-@xmath772 electrification ( see the next subsection ) .    in this case",
    ", writing @xmath822 for real @xmath823 on the horizontal card , the electrified solution goes singular at the locus @xmath824 . picking @xmath772 sufficiently negative , there are s - schwarzschild singularities hugging around the @xmath813 and @xmath814 boundaries which are still horizons .",
    "each has an associated connected 4-card spacetime which generalizes s - rn .",
    "it is possible to get three s - schwarzschild singularities and one horizon : instead of the sign flip , we can utilize harrison s third theorem ( [ harrisonthird ] ) .",
    "picking @xmath785 , we get @xmath825 on the @xmath811 , @xmath813 , @xmath814 , @xmath816 boundaries .",
    "this is ready to be turned into a charged s - brane solution via a real-@xmath772 electrification .    in this case",
    "we can pick @xmath772 sufficiently positive so there are s - schwarzschild singularities hugging the @xmath813 , @xmath814 , and @xmath816 boundaries .",
    "the @xmath811 boundary is still a horizon .",
    "so this is like s - rn but the horizontal card has three disjoint singularities .",
    "we now give a prescription for a non - nakedly singular 5d spacetime using two rods , one turned on its side .",
    "write the killing coordinates @xmath373 , @xmath63 , @xmath571 in that order .",
    "say that part of the boundary has order @xmath826 if @xmath827 , @xmath828 , and @xmath829 vanish to orders @xmath830 , @xmath831 , and @xmath832 .",
    "of course @xmath833 .",
    "take killing orders @xmath722 , @xmath714 , and @xmath718 for @xmath834 , @xmath176 , and @xmath835 .",
    "add in a @xmath836 rod of length @xmath837 centered at @xmath838 and turn it on its side .",
    "we then get ( see figure  [ 5dringcard ] ) a @xmath68 boundary of @xmath718 , @xmath716 , and @xmath839 .",
    "note that the horizon is adjacent to a @xmath63-circle closing and its quarter - plane vertical card will be nonsingular .",
    "the @xmath777 boundary is @xmath722 , @xmath714 , and @xmath718 .",
    "again its horizon is adjacent to the @xmath571-circle closing and its quarter - plane vertical card will be nonsingular .",
    "the singularities in this spacetime are confined to the horizontal card and they are related by trivial killing rotation to @xmath720 boundaries which are ordinary 5d black hole ones ; so they are no more singular than the 5d s - schwarzschild .",
    "= 3.5 in      weyl s electrification procedure @xcite can be applied to any israel - khan solution or wick rotation thereof .",
    "calling our old gravitational potential @xmath823 , the new one is given by @xmath840 where @xmath841 and @xmath324 are constants and @xmath57 does not change . using the conformal symmetry of the einstein - maxwell system and the freedom to shift @xmath7 by a constant we may take @xmath842 . as applied to schwarzschild of mass @xmath843 , this generates reissner - nordstrm of @xmath844 where @xmath845 . as applied to s - schwarzschild , since we had sent @xmath122 this generates an e - rn .",
    "the point of ( [ electrify ] ) is that the weyl cards of the spacetime do not change , but singularities move . where @xmath846 used to behave like @xmath847",
    ", @xmath6 behaves like @xmath848 .",
    "so horizons stay horizons and schwarzschild singularities become horizons .",
    "new singularities are generated where the quantity in parentheses vanishes , and generically this is to first order , generating schwarzschild singularities .",
    "for imaginary @xmath772 , @xmath849 will turn the s - schwarzschild into an s - rn .",
    "any value of @xmath772 is then allowed .",
    "this transformation also charges the witten bubble .",
    "these electrifications seemingly do not generate superextremal solutions , which require a change in the card structure .",
    "( they have branch cuts instead of line segments . )",
    "in this paper we have examined the utility of the weyl ansatz and constructed an associated card diagram .",
    "the card diagram conveniently captures most of the interesting properties of a spacetime including its singularities , horizons , null infinity and some of its causal structure .",
    "the main technical details that one has to deal with regarding card diagrams seem to be analytic continuation of the coordinates , special null lines and the choice of the branch of a square root , and branch points .    here",
    "we give a summary of the solutions we have discussed in this paper .",
    "the card diagrams correctly capture the different regions of the charged reissner - nordstrm black hole and its various charged and chargeless limits , and its negative mass complement .",
    "we also analyzed the kerr black hole and its singularity structure ; the passage to the second asymptotic universe through @xmath18 is quite clearly depicted .",
    "the witten bubble and s - brane had three card diagrams since there were three choices of coordinates which were compatible with the weyl ansatz .",
    "the hyperbolic representations had no foci on the card diagram . in the case of the bubble",
    "the card diagram is a half - plane vertical card , while the s - schwarzschild was more technically involved and had a branch point which we fixed with a conformal mapping .",
    "the elliptic representations were very similar and consisted of two foci and six individual cards .",
    "the main difference is that for the s - schwarzschild , the left 4-card junction is not a horizon but a singularity .",
    "finally the parabolic representation of the bubble was an infinite array of triangles connected pointwise while the s - schwarzschild had a 6-card butterfly shape .",
    "this third representation has a useful representation of their null infinity .",
    "the s - schwarzschild can be obtained from the bubble in two ways .",
    "one may start with the bubble and analytically continue @xmath116 in weyl coordinates . in this case the hyperbolic / elliptic / parabolic representation of the bubble maps to the elliptic / hyperbolic / parabolic representation of the s - brane .",
    "there was also a second way to relate these two solutions which we termed the @xmath7-flip and which was conveniently visualized as a flip of the associated cards about a null line .",
    "this procedure maintains the number of weyl foci on the card and so maps all bubbles to similarly labelled s - branes .",
    "the @xmath7-flip provides a very simple and interesting way to relate schwarzschild with the bubble and the s - brane .",
    "in fact all spacetimes related in this way by @xmath7-flips can be simultaneously drawn together in a complexified weyl spacetime diagram .",
    "there are six s - dihole universes which we called @xmath274 , @xmath850 and @xmath273 , @xmath851 .",
    "the three @xmath274 universes were non - singular and had interesting near horizon scaling limits which we named @xmath275 .",
    "the @xmath273 universes were singular on a so called ergosphere , represented the decay of two dimensional unstable objects , and @xmath247 itself had an s - melvin universe scaling limits .",
    "it was also previously noted that both the dihole and the s - dihole i solutions had melvin scaling limits .",
    "the reason for this is that all these melvin limits come from the same neighborhood of the complexified weyl space .",
    "these solutions were then generalized to include new arrays as compared to those mentioned in @xcite .",
    "the generalization includes allowing for black holes on the real time axis which gives ds@xmath78 horizons with @xmath279-type scaling limits , and we were even able to construct a periodic universe .",
    "we also detailed multiple rod solutions such as black rings , s - black rings , the c - metric .",
    "new electrified 4d solutions and a 2-horizon vacuum rod 5d solutions were given .",
    "gravitational wave solutions were shown to have several choices for branches .",
    "finally we turn to some comments on future work . as for the s - brane solutions we have presented here",
    ", it seems possible that the relationship between the general array solution and the melvin scaling limit may have some connection to the discussion on the decay of unstable branes . in particular",
    "while the s - dihole is generally unstable and will decay , the decay time can be made as long as we wish by appropriately scaling the parameters . also while we have now found an infinite array solution with horizons , there is still potentially much to understand regarding this solution and its exact relation to the rolling tachyon .",
    "further investigation of this decay process , its relation to the work in ref .",
    "@xcite and the possibility of an open - closed string duality could prove interesting .",
    "we hope the techniques herein and this method of visualization are helpful for keeping track of the numerous wick rotations and mentally partitioning complicated spacetimes into simpler regions . aside from being a useful way to describe spacetime structures , and follow their wick rotations , card diagrams may have alternative uses . as discussed in @xcite , the higher dimensional schwarzschild solutions can not be written in weyl form and so do not have weyl card diagrams",
    ". however , card diagrams are more general than as described in this paper ; the recently developed weyl - papapetrou formalism @xcite for @xmath852 will yield card diagrams .",
    "furthermore card diagrams do not really require weyl s canonical coordinates .",
    "spacetimes with weyl - type symmetry and yet where weyl s procedure fails algebraically can still admit card diagrams .",
    "an example is the inclusion of a nonzero cosmological constant @xmath853 , where a @xmath7-flip changes the sign of @xmath853 .",
    "we also hope that these methods , or their further generalizations , have even greater applicability than to the multitude of spacetimes already discussed .",

    "the formalism of @xcite can be extended for general @xmath11 to include an electrostatic potential .",
    "this is somewhat surprising since the electromagnetic energy - momentum tensor @xmath854 is traceless only in @xmath5 and so einstein s equations are more complicated .",
    "nevertheless , a cancellation does occur and one may sum the diagonal killing frame components of the ricci tensor to achieve a harmonic condition .    follow the notation of @xcite and add a 1-form potential @xmath855 where @xmath856 is timelike ( @xmath857 ) and all other @xmath858 , @xmath859 are spacelike ( with @xmath860 ) .",
