    "geometrically induced bound states in infinitely stretched regions with a hard - wall ( or dirichlet ) boundary attracted a lot attention in recent years , in particular , because they represent a purely quantum effect which can not be approached from the usual semiclassical point of view .",
    "the attention was first paid to tubes where the effective attraction is caused by bending @xcite , later the analogous question was addressed with one dimension added , in curved layers @xcite .",
    "this question is more complicated and to the date we do not have a full analogue of the result saying that _ any _ local bending of an asymptotically straight tube exhibits such bound states .",
    "one reason is that geometry of surfaces is more complicated than that of curves and global properties play a more important role .",
    "however , this is not the only difference between tubes and layers . in the case of the former we have various solvable examples .",
    "they often correspond to tubes with a non - smooth boundary being thus beyond the assumptions under which the general results are proved and illustrating the robustness of the effect ; on the other hand they can be composed of simple building blocks which facilitates their solvability .",
    "in fact , some examples came already before the general theory @xcite and others were found in parallel with it  see , e.g. , @xcite for a review .",
    "this is in contrast with our state of knowledge concerning the layers .",
    "we have reasonably strong and general existence results @xcite , later even extended to layers in higher dimensions @xcite , as well a particular `` weak coupling '' result @xcite , but to the date no solvable example is known .",
    "the goal of the present work is to discuss such an example in the geometrical situation which is particularly simple  apart of a trivial scaling the model depends on a single parameter .",
    "the layer to consider is the region bordered by two conical surfaces shifted mutually along the cone axis by @xmath2 . using a natural separation of variables",
    "the angular component can be separated and the problem can be in each partial wave reduced to analysis of an appropriate operator on a skewed semi - infinite strip .",
    "this will be demonstrated in the next section and used in sec .  3 to derive some properties of the corresponding discrete spectrum .",
    "to illustrate these results and to provide further insights into this binding mechanism , we present in the following section a numerical analysis of the problem : we calculate the eigenvalue dependence on the cone opening angle and present examples of eigenfunctions .",
    "as we have said the object of our study is the hamiltonian of a quantum particle confined to a hard - wall conical layer of the opening angle @xmath0 for a fixed @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath4 where @xmath5     and [ ss : partial ] , the right part shows the cross section in rotated coordinates @xmath6 used in sec .",

    "in order to get a more detailed information and a better insight let us study next the spectrum numerically . as a consequence of proposition  [ s - states ] ,",
    "we may limit ourselves to two  dimensional geometry , _ i.e. _ to consider the spectrum of ( [ partial2 ] ) for @xmath28 . recall that the corresponding eigenfunctions are independent of the angular variable @xmath79 so we can choose @xmath115 arriving at the two  dimensional problem depicted in fig .",
    "note also that the alternative formulation ( [ partial4 ] ) leads to the same results .",
    "the first difficulty we meet is the absence of reliable estimates concerning the span of eigenfunctions .",
    "the knowledge of the region where the eigenfunctions are negligible is important .",
    "we have to carry out integration over an infinite region and we need to cut the integration somewhere , unless we transform the problem to a finite region .",
    "this , however , brings problems of other kinds ruling out , in particular , use of the mode - matching approach .    from general considerations we know that the smaller the gap between the eigenvalue and the continuum threshold , of course , the farther is the wavefunction stretched . also ,",
    "for small opening angles eigenfunctions spread farther .",
    "this rule of thumb may be of help as a rough estimate of integration region .",
    "we must admit that we have not found a method which would be efficient enough and intuitive at the same time . to summarize our experience we prefer finite element methods . in view of the absence of knowledge of a practical span of configuration space mentioned above even this approach",

    "we have also tried to employ the galerkin method .",
    "the idea was to choose a set of test functions satisfying the boundary conditions .",

    "i.e. _ how to choose the particular form of the test functions .",
    "the choices we attempted led to substantially more time consuming calculation than fem , so fitting test functions are to be found yet .       is the accumulation point of all of them and they approach it from below as @xmath116 .",
    "the thick dot marks the value @xmath117 indicated in proposition  [ lowerb ] ; the picture suggests that the eigenvalues tend to it monotonously as @xmath118 . ]    the first question concerns the dependence of eigenvalues on the opening angle illustrated on fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] in the interval between 1 and 15 degrees .",
    "it agrees well with the general picture : the planar layer , @xmath119 , does not support any eigenvalue below the threshold , while for any @xmath120 there are by theorem  [ disc_spec ] infinitely many such isolated eigenvalues , albeit all are weakly bound for sufficiently open conical layers . as the opening angle becomes more acute the low - lying states become gradually more strongly bound .",
    "the numerical results show no degeneracies .    .",
    "in view of the axial symmetry , we show only one half of @xmath121 .",
    "the the @xmath122 and @xmath123scales are different , the vertical axis being scaled by factor five : the transversal width is @xmath1 and @xmath124 ranges from @xmath125 to @xmath126 .",
    "nodal lines are indicated in black colour ; higher eigenfuctions have clearly a quasi - onedimensional character . ]",
    "as we move away from the ground state , structure of the eigenfunctions acquires more and more a one - dimensional character .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig  [ fig3 ] when the seven lowest eigenfunctions for the angle @xmath127 are calculated .",
    "as expected , the ground - state eigenfunction can be chosen positive . on the other hand",
    ", the excited states display a number of nodal lines ( nodal surfaces of the full problem ) that is in a one - to - one correspondence with the eigenvalue index of the sequence @xmath128 , in an analogy with the classical oscillation theorem .",
    "notice also that the node distances are increasing with the distance of the cone tip .",
    "this behaviour has to be associated with the fact that the effective - curvature induced potential in ( [ partial4 ] ) is proportional to @xmath129 having thus the same scaling behaviour as the kinetic part of the hamiltonian .     for the same situation as in fig .",
    "all the eigenfunctions are normalized to the same constant , so that relative height ratios reflect the true situation ( not distorted by different normalization of individual functions ) .",
    "there are two areas with higher probability , one in the vicinity of the inner tip and the other one at the `` far end '' of the function extent .",
    "the latter moves away from the vertex as the eigenvalue number increases . ]",
    "another observation worth commenting is shown on fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , where we have plotted ( a side view of the ) squared eigenfunctions @xmath130 with @xmath131 for the same opening angle @xmath86 as above .",
    "as the index @xmath132 grows , dominant regions lie around the inner tip and at the `` far end '' of eigenfunction extent , more exactly , between the last two nodal lines .",
    "consequently , location of the regions with the largest probability of finding the particle in the conical layer depends on the eigenvalue number in this way .",
    "our discussion has not exhausted by far all open questions concerning spectra of conical layers . we have also mentioned the eigenvalue monotonicity which is expected to hold and supported by the above numerical result .",
    "a related question concerns the simplicity of the spectrum .",
    "it is again seen in the numerical example and its validity is strongly supported by the quasi - one - dimensional character of the higher eigenfunctions , but these considerations can not replace a rigorous proof .",
    "other open questions are associated with the behaviour for extreme values of @xmath86 which we left out in the previous section because these cases are numerically demanding . for small values of @xmath86",
    "the density of eigenvalues above @xmath133 should grow in accordance with proposition  [ lowerb ] .",
    "what we see nevertheless is that already for @xmath127 the excited states have nodal lines ( or nodal surfaces of the full problem ) inside the cone `` cap '' ; one can ask about critical values of @xmath86 for which one of those touches the inner tip . on the other hand",
    ", one can ask about the spectral asymptotics as @xmath116 .",
    "in contrast to @xcite the geometric perturbation is not compactly supported for conical layers and the effective potential is on the borderline between short- and long - range cases , so it is not a priori clear what the asymptotic expansion could be .    of interest",
    "is also the continuous spectrum of conical layers , both from the point of view of scattering  existence of wave operators and their asymptotic completeness  as well as of resonances .",
    "being bound by the deadline of this issue , we leave all these questions to a later investigation .",
    "we dedicate this paper to the memory of pierre duclos , a longtime friend and collaborator , who was always interested in geometrically induced spectral effects .",
    "we thank the referees for the remarks which helped us to improve the text .",
