    "@xmath1 car is a very massive stellar binary system , with an orbital period of @xmath2 ( damineli 1996 ) , as observed in all wavelengths ( e.g. , radio , duncan & white 2003 ; ir , whitelock et al .",

    "the high eccentricity of @xmath3 results in rapid changes in emission and absorption lines , as well as in the continuum , near each periastron passage .",
    "the several weeks of the rapid changes occurring every orbital period is termed the spectroscopic event .",
    "these lines might originate in different places in the binary system : the primary star , the secondary star , their respective winds , and the colliding winds structure which is termed the conical shell .",
    "as @xmath1 car is the best studied binary luminous blue variable ( lbv ) , it holds the key to our understanding of other lbvs .",
    "it is particulary important to understand the behavior near periastron passage , where the strongest binary interaction takes place , and for that is crucial to know the orientation of the binary system .",
    "namely , the direction of the primary more massive lbv star relative to its less massive but hotter companion at periastron passage . while it is agreed that the inclination of the binary system is @xmath4 ( davidson et al .",
    "2001 ; smith 2006 ) , there is no agreement on the direction of the semimajor axis , termed periastron longitude .",
    "the orientation is measured by the angle @xmath5 : @xmath6 for the case when the secondary moves toward us before periastron passage and the semimajor axis is perpendicular to the line of sight , @xmath7 when the secondary is toward us at periastron passage , and @xmath8 when the primary is toward us at periastron passage .",
    "several properties of the binary system have been used to deduce the orbital orientation , with contradicting results ( for details see kashi & soker , 2008b , 2009c ) .",
    "one of the properties that led to a contradicting conclusion on the orientation is the behavior of the blue absorption wing of the he  i  @xmath0 line . in kashi & soker ( 2009b )",
    "we constructed a toy model where the material responsible for the blue absorption wing was assumed to reside in the colliding winds region  the conical shell  close to the binary system .",
    "this model is able to account for the transient appearance of the blue absorbing wing and to the finding that the maximum absorbing velocity is reached several days before periastron passage , only if the secondary is toward us near periastron passage , i.e. , @xmath9 . in a recent paper groh et al .",
    "( 2010 ; hereafter g2010 ) reached an opposite conclusion .",
    "comparing their observations with a model based on 3d numerical simulations of the colliding winds structure , g2010 suggested that the orientation is that of @xmath10 .",
    "namely , the primary is closer to us just before periastron passage . in this paper",
    "we critically reexamine both models .",
    "the he  i  @xmath0 line has been observed for more than a decade , but only occasionally ( damineli et al .",
    "1998 , groh et al . 2007 ; damineli et al .",
    "2008b ; g2010 ) . the line shows a p - cygni profile varying in time , especially close to the spectroscopic event .",
    "it has a complicated emission with three spikes , and absorbing components with velocities of up to @xmath11 . in this section",
    "we describe the relevant properties of the blue absorption wing that rapidly appears and disappears near periastron passages .",
    "g2010 observed the he  i  @xmath0 across the 2009 periastron passage . in fig .",
    "[ fig : profile ] we show the absorption profile at phase 11.998 , four days before the 2009 spectroscopic event , assumed to occur at phase 12.000 ( damineli et al . 2008b , groh & damineli 2004 ) , taken from fig . 1 of g2010 .",
    "the profile at phase 11.991 is practically similar in shape , but the absorption is somewhat weaker .        at phases 11.998 and 11.991 we can identify three flat parts in the spectrum , as marked on fig . [",
    "fig : profile ] .    1 .",
    "_ p - component . _",
    "the deepest component can be safely identified with the regular primary wind .",
    "this part exists during all phases , it is deep , and its velocity matches that of the primary wind .",
    "the primary wind reaches terminal velocities of @xmath12@xmath13 , depending on latitude ( smith et al .",
    "there is no dispute about the origin of this component .",
    "m - component .",
    "_ although less prominent , the m - component has a flat profile in the velocity range @xmath14@xmath15 .",
    "we are not sure about its nature , but we do see signatures that it exists at phases 11.875 , 12.014 and 12.041 , although less prominently . we attribute it to parts in the primary wind that are accelerated to somewhat higher velocities .",
    "these may be , for example , clouds with higher opacity , e.g. , due to dust formation .",
    "we note that before the 2009 periastron passage the primary wind might have undergone some fluctuations in its velocity , which may have been evident in the x - ray lightcurve ( kashi & soker 2009d ) .",
    "f - component .",
    "_ we identify the main parts of this component with the flat part in the velocity range @xmath16@xmath17 , and the tail formed by faster and lower column density gas with absorption extending to @xmath18 .",
    "this tail is not due to line broadening in the main part of the absorbing component .",
    "the f - component does not exist at all at phases 11.875 , 12.014 and 12.041 .",
    "namely , it is a transient component appearing for a short time before periastron passage . in its flat part",
    "this component absorbs @xmath19 per cent of the continuum at phase 11.998 , and @xmath20 per cent at phase 11.991 .",
    "we attribute the f - component to pre and post - shock secondary wind material close to the binary system ( kashi & soker 2009b ) .",
    "the post - shock gas resides in the conical shell .",
    "we further assume that the secondary wind gas absorbs most of the continuum emitted by the gas in the conical shell ( emission that increases just before periastron passage ) , in addition to absorbing some fraction of the continuum emitted by the primary wind .",
    "it is this component that is in dispute between g2010 and us .",
    "although g2010 and us attribute it to the colliding winds , in the model of g2010 the absorbing gas is at a distance of tens of @xmath21 from the binary systems , while in our model the absorbing material is relatively close to the binary system .",
    "one thing to notice is that the first observation after the 2009 spectroscopic event is at phase 12.014 , before the system exits from the x - ray minimum ( corcoran 2010 ) , and before the hard ionizing radiation from the secondary resumes after exiting the dense primary wind . as we note in section [ sec : problem ] , this holds difficulties to the model of g2010 .",
    "the purpose of this section is to set the motivation for a model where the fast absorbing material reside close to the secondary star , and the secondary star is in front of the primary near periastron passage .",
    "we critically examine a model with an opposite binary orientation , and reveal its problems .",
    "g2010 present ( in their fig .",
    "12m - o ) the total column density as a function of gas velocity at 5 phases according to their assumptions .",
    "their main assumptions are that : ( 1 ) the photospheric radius of the primary at @xmath22 is @xmath23 .",
    "( 2 ) a point source can be used for the central source of the @xmath22 continuum emission .",
    "( 3 ) the central source is the only source of the continuum ( below we claim that the conical shell is an additional source ) .",
    "( 4 ) g2010 did not consider even qualitatively the change in level population . in their model",
    "the change in level population must be significant ; below we argue why this is unlikely .    in more details , their fig .",
    "12 gives the density of material as a function of line of sight distance to the primary for 5 orbital phases ( 11.875 , 11.991 , 11.998 , 12.014 and 12.041 ) and 6 orientations ( @xmath6 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 ) .",
    "in addition , the column density along the same assumed line of sight to the primary star is given as a function of the line of sight velocity , for each orientation and phase .",
    "12 of g2010 allows us to deduce the basic properties of their model .",
    "g2010 did not relate the total column density to the absorption of the he  i  @xmath0 line .",
    "we attempt to do so and check what the results of g2010 imply .",
    "as we now show , their model , with a preferred orientation of @xmath10 , suffers from severe problems because the column density does not follow even qualitatively the behavior of the observed absorption . in their attempt to resolve this discrepancy , g2010 claim that the presence of high velocity gas in our line of sight is a necessary , but not sufficient condition for the presence of high velocity absorption . as the amount of absorption depends on the population of the lower energy level of the he  i  @xmath0 line ( @xmath29 ) , they attribute the differences in absorption to different population of the @xmath29 atomic level .",
    "for the three phases before periastron passage ( 11.875 , 11.991 , 11.998 ) , g2010 model ( in their fig .",
    "12o ) predicts the absorbing column density in the range @xmath30@xmath31 to be about equal to that in the velocity range @xmath32@xmath33 .",
    "observations show substantial absorption in the @xmath32@xmath33 range at phases 11.991 ( @xmath34 per cent absorption ) and 11.998 ( @xmath35 per cent absorption ) , while there is no absorption at @xmath36 ( fig . 1 of g2010 ) .",
    "g2010 attribute the difference to stratification in the population of the @xmath29 level , from which the he  i  @xmath0 line is absorbed .",
    "however , they do not present a qualitative study of the way the population of the @xmath29 level can evolve so rapidly",
    ". we find it extremely unlikely ( unless there is a carefully arranged fine tuning ) that differences in populating the @xmath29 level can account for this difference .",
    "the reason is as follows .",
    "according to g2010 model during the phase interval 11.99111.998 the absorbing gas at @xmath37 resides at a distance of @xmath38 from the binary system , where @xmath39 is the semimajor axis ( their fig .",
    "they also find that the gas absorbing in the velocity range @xmath32@xmath33 resides at @xmath40 . during this phase interval ,",
    "the binary orbital separation is @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , the differences in the radiation of the two stars at @xmath42 and @xmath43 are small , and can not account for the required large differences in the population of the @xmath29 level .",
    "moreover , the increase in the amount of absorption as the system approaches periastron in the model of g2010 is attributed to an increase in the population of the @xmath29 level .",
    "this is probably ( g2010 do not specify the reason ) because the secondary gets deeper into the primary wind , and less of its radiation reaches the absorbing gas .",
    "it is expected that the outer regions , where gas moving at @xmath37 resides , will get less of the secondary radiation , and hence will absorb more .",
    "this is opposite to what their model requires .    a potential way to handle",
    "the problem is that the material closer - in is of higher density , and it recombines first or its collisional excitation is more efficient .",
    "this would not work either .",
    "the rate of these two processes is linear with density .",
    "the density ratio between the region absorbing in the @xmath32@xmath33 range to that absorbing in the @xmath44 range is @xmath45 ( g2010 ; fig .",
    "12m , n ) .",
    "therefore , the absorption at @xmath44 is expected to be one half of that in the @xmath32@xmath33 velocity range",
    ". this amounts to @xmath46 per cent of the flux at phase 11.991 and @xmath47 per cent of the flux at phase 11.998 .",
    "this is clearly ruled out by observations , as the absorption at @xmath37 observed in these two phases is practically zero .      in phase 12.014",
    "( 28 days after phase 12 ) the column density calculated by g2010 in the velocity range @xmath48@xmath17 is a factor of 2 - 3 lower than that at phase 11.998 , while in @xmath32@xmath33 this ratio is @xmath49 ( their fig .",
    "12o ) . at phase 12.014",
    "the secondary radiation has not started yet to ionize the material at large distances , as it is still inside the dense region of the primary wind .",
    "we know this from the behavior of the highly ionized lines , e.g. , in the weigelt blobs , which show that the hard radiation resumed ( in the 2003.5 spectroscopic event ) well after the x - ray minimum ended ( damineli et al .",
    "2008b ; mehner et al .",
    "2010 ) . in the 2009 spectroscopic event",
    "the x - ray minimum ended at phase @xmath50 ( corcoran 2010 ) , when one of the he  i  @xmath0 line measurements was conducted .",
    "namely , at this phase the secondary hard ionizing radiation did not ionize the he in the relevant distance of tens of @xmath21 . the density in the relevant region at phase 12.014 is not much different from that at phase 11.998 .",
    "if it was for recombination , there should have been more time for the gas at phase 12.014 to recombine .    over all in the velocity ranges @xmath48@xmath17 and @xmath32@xmath33 the column density calculated by g2010 at phase 12.014 is @xmath51 that at phase 11.998 , and the ionization state should be the same .",
    "therefore , it is expected that the absorption at phase 12.014 in the velocity ranges @xmath48@xmath17 and @xmath32@xmath33 would be @xmath51 times that at phase 11.998 , or even above its value at phase 11.998 .",
    "this is contrary to observations , as there is no absorption at all for @xmath52 at phase 12.014 ( fig . 1 of g2010 )",
    "this is a severe problem for the model presented by g2010 .",
    "not only the model of g2010 , but any other model that would assume absorption by materiel residing at a large distance ( a few @xmath53 or more ) is problematic .",
    "the reason is that the absorption of the he  i  @xmath0 line in high velocities is a transient event , which occurs very close to periastron , and must be related to variations in the system shortly before periastron .",
    "the material far from the binary system does not suppose to show fast variations close to periastron , and for that it is a bad candidate for an absorber of the he  i  @xmath0 line .",
    "we perform hydrodynamic simulations of the colliding winds to show that the column density of the conical shell and the pre - shocked secondary wind at high velocities is high enough to account for the absorption of the he  i  @xmath0 line .",
    "the simulations are performed with virginia hydrodynamics - i ( vh-1 ) , a high resolution multidimensional astrophysical hydrodynamics code developed by j. blondin and collaborators ( blondin et al .",
    "1990 ; stevens et al . , 1992 ; blondin 1994 ) .",
    "the code includes radiative cooling at all temperatures of @xmath54 .",
    "the radiative cooling is set to zero for temperatures of @xmath55 , and the gas can not cool to lower temperatures .",
    "the cooling function @xmath56 ( for solar abundances ) is taken from sutherland & dopita ( 1993 ; their table 6 ) .",
    "the numerical simulations were performed in the cartesian geometry @xmath57 mode of the code ( a 3d calculation ) , where the orbital plane is the @xmath58 plane with the @xmath59 axis taken to be parallel to the line connecting the two stars .",
    "our numerical simulation grid has 112 equal - size grid points along each axis .",
    "the primary and the secondary are located in the middle of the @xmath60 and @xmath61 axes . the binary separation between the two stars",
    "is set to be constant at each numerical run ( for the justification see akashi & soker 2010 ) .",
    "the mass loss rates and velocities of the winds are @xmath62 and @xmath63 , and @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively ( e.g. , pittard & corcoran 2002 ; kashi & soker 2008b and references therein ) .",
    "we use eccentricity of @xmath66 and semi - major axis of @xmath67 .",
    "we performed four runs with binary separation of @xmath68 @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 @xmath21 , and in each created a density profile and wind velocity field around the two stars . at the location of each star",
    "we inject its appropriate wind .",
    "we let the flow reach an approximately steady state .",

    "we calculate the direction to the observer for a system with @xmath73 ) , and for the phase before periastron corresponding to the binary separation of the run .",
    "we take a plane perpendicular to the line of sight and located behind the primary , and from this plane we calculate the column density along a grid of lines of sight to the observer .",
    "we select the location of this plane in an approximately optimal way to include as much of the grid as possible .",
    "this procedure favors accuracy in the calculation of the column density of the high velocity gas towards the observer .",
    "each line of sight is divided into cells , as the number of @xmath61 planes the line of sight crosses in our grid .",
    "we calculate the column density along each line of sight as function of the velocity projected along the line of sight .",
    "like g2010 we use velocity bins of @xmath74 .",
    "we adopt the conclusions of g2010 that the main source of the @xmath22 continuum emission comes mostly from a region of size @xmath75 centered on the primary star .",
    "we term it the central source .",
    "though g2010 used a point source for the central source of the @xmath22 continuum emission , they mentioned that it is of size of several @xmath21 , based on observations by weigelt et al .",

    "( 2007 ) found the decrease function of the central source intensity with projected distance from the center @xmath76 to be close to a gaussian ( their fig .",
    "we therefore take the emission to be from a radius of @xmath77 , and weighted the intensity as a gaussian with @xmath78 @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the intensity at the center ( the cut - off at @xmath81 is used due to numerical constrains and results in a negligible error ) .    the column density from each line of sight",
    "is weighted with the gaussian in equation ( [ eq : gaussian ] ) according to its distance @xmath76 from the line of sight of the primary ( fig .",

    "the column density from each line of sight is weighted with a gaussian ( equation [ eq : gaussian ] ) . ]        from fig .",
    "[ fig : n_h_vs_v ] we learn the following : ( 1 ) for @xmath7 the column density in the conical shell and the undisturbed wind is high enough to account for the absorption of the he  i  @xmath0 line for our favored orientation of @xmath7 . as the model of g2010 ,",
    "our model is unable to calculate the population of the @xmath29 level of he  i , and hence we can not calculate the exact absorption in the he  i  @xmath0 line .",
    "( 2 ) the high column density for @xmath86 is a transient component which appears only for a short period before periastron passage .",
    "( 3 ) the column density clearly increases as the system approaches periastron ( note that in fig .",
    "12 of g2010 this is not the case ) .",
    "( 4 ) the column density decreases towards higher blue velocities , despite of minor fluctuations due to the limited numerical resolution .",
    "( 5 ) at short binary separations ( @xmath87 ; @xmath88 ) there is a plateau in the column density between @xmath89 and @xmath90 , followed by a decrease in column density towards higher blue velocities .",
    "our model gives that at very high velocities of @xmath36 the column density is also large , namely we have more absorbing gas than required to account for the observations .",
    "this discrepancy may be the result of an anisotropic secondary wind velocity close to periastron passage , that can occur if the acceleration of the secondary wind is not isotropic , an effect which was not taken into account in our simulation .",
    "such an effect can reduce the amount of gas which outflows at @xmath36 .",
    "the acceleration can be efficient along polar directions , but below @xmath91 radiation from the primary and previous accretion of blobs might cause the secondary wind to be slower .",

    "the model of g2010 fails to reproduce , even qualitatively , the observed absorption profiles of the he  i  @xmath0 line , and can not account for the absence of the f - component after periastron passage . in analyzing our ( kashi & soker 2008b , 2009b ) preferred orientation of @xmath7 , g2010 use a point - like central continuum source for calculating the column density of the absorbing material .",

    "this is the main reason why g2010 fail to reproduce results of a model where the absorption occurs a few @xmath21 from the stars , like in our model .",
    "we improve our pervious model ( kashi & soker 2009b ) which assumed that the conical shell is the main absorber of the high velocity component of the he  i  @xmath0 line ( section [ sec : omega90 ] ) .",
    "our model and results can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "we assume that the central star is a gaussian weighted extended continuum source as given by equation ( [ eq : gaussian ] ) .",
    "this assumption stands on a solid ground ( g2010 ; weigelt et al .",
    "we assume that the increase in the @xmath22 continuum near periastron passage comes from the conical shell ( the collision region of the two winds ) .",
    "the main source is the shocked primary wind .",
    "this is based on analysis we performed in previous papers .",
    "we assume that the main absorbing gas of the he  i  @xmath0 line is both pre and post - shock material in the fast secondary wind .",
    "this assumption stands on a solid ground .",
    "based on recent numerical simulations ( akashi & soker 2010 ) , we showed in section [ sec : omega90 ] that the column density of the fast moving gas is as high as found by g2010 .",
    "some segments of the wind are at a temperature of @xmath110 , and there are enough recombining he atoms .",
    "this will be calculated in a future paper based on high resolution numerical simulations .",
    "we concentrate on the absorption of the f - component .",
    "we assume that in the flat velocity range of the f - component ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : profile ] ) , the absorbing gas in the conical shell absorbs most of the conical shell emission .",
    "we therefore consider two limiting values for this parameter @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "we assume that the optical depth of the conical shell in the flat velocity range of the f - component is very high , such that it absorbs all the radiation of the central source it hides from our line of sight ( in the flat part ) .",
    "we assume that the colliding winds shell has an hyperbolic shape .",
    "we consider its tilt due to the orbital motion . in calculating the shape and",
    "tilt the primary wind acceleration zone is considered .",
    "7 .   we assume , based on our previous papers ( kashi & soker 2008b,2009c ) , that the secondary is toward us near periastron ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "we take an inclination angle of @xmath114 , and the other commonly used binary parameters ( semimajor axis , eccentricity , etc . ) .",
    "we note that after periastron passage some of the assumptions break down , because accretion is likely to occur ( kashi & soker 2009a ; akashi & soker 2010 ) .",
    "we calculate the part of the central source covered by the conical shell , for @xmath7 . 10 .",
    "we calculate the covered part of the @xmath22 central continuum emission source ( equation [ eq : fobs ] ) . by",
    "that we show that for @xmath7 our model explains the observed increase in absorption strength of the f - component close to periastron passage ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fobs ] ) , and explains its transient nature .",
    "we therefore conclude that the orientation is indeed that the secondary is toward us near periastron ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "in addition , using hydrodynamic simulations ( fig . [",
    "fig : simulation ] and [ fig : n_h_vs_v ] ) we find that the he  i in the conical shell and in the pre - shocked secondary wind has a substantial column density in the velocity range @xmath115@xmath17 .",
    "we assume that the fraction ( out of total he atoms and ions ) of the he  i in the @xmath29 level is high enough to absorb most radiation in the @xmath116 ( with a tail up to @xmath11 ) .",
    "the finding that the secondary is closer to us near periastron requires that some properties near periastron passage be explained by the accretion of the primary wind onto the secondary star ( kashi & soker 2008a , 2009d ) . for accretion to occur onto the secondary star , that has a strong wind of his own , the binary must be close ( akashi & soker 2010 ) and to interact strongly with the primary .",
    "the accretion that occurs near periastron passage is crucial to the understanding not only the present behavior of @xmath1 car , but also its behavior during the major eruptions it undergone in the 19th century , the great eruption ( ge ) and lesser eruption .",
    "the debate on the absorbing source of the blue wing has implications far beyond the specific question on the orientation of the major axis of the binary system .",
    "the essence of the debate is the nature of the binary interaction process , which has implications on the nature of lbv major eruptions , and mass loss by very massive stars ( e.g. , soker 2001 , 2005 , 2007 ; kashi & soker 2010 ; smith et al .",
    "2010 ; smith 2010a , b ) .",
    "the ge is the best studied example for a major lbv eruption , and serves as a test case for theories and models .",
    "a high rate accretion during the ge could have supplied the extra luminosity for 20 years , and the accreting secondary star could have launched two jets that shaped the bipolar structure  the homunculus ( soker 2001 ) .",
    "most likely other lbv major eruptions are also related to binary interaction ( kashi & soker 2010 ) , as was argued for the 17th century eruption of p  cygni ( kashi 2010 ) , rather than a single star phenomena as suggested by , e.g. , smith ( 2007 ) .",
    "smith & owocki ( 2006 ) suggested that lbvs lose most of their envelope mass during major eruptions .",
    "therefore , the presence of a strongly interacting companion can play a major role in the evolution of very massive stars . as suggested by kashi et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , major mass transfer events in lbvs are related to optical transient objects and have a common powering mechanism ",
    "accretion onto a companion star .",
    "understanding the binary interaction in @xmath1 car will shed light on other objects where binary interaction is thought to shape circumstellar nebulae , like planetary nebulae , symbiotic systems , and related objects such as the red rectangle .",

    "a support to a short duration absorption by the conical shell near periastron passage might come from the behavior of the hydrogen h@xmath121 line .",
    "the hydrogen atom is a simple atom , lacking the complications resulting from absorption from a meta - stable state as for the he  i  @xmath0 line .",

    "the variations in the doppler shift of the h@xmath121 line are much smaller , perhaps @xmath124 times those of the he  i  @xmath123 line ( hard to tell ) .",

    "2009 ) the h@xmath121 line shows an anomalous wide blue absorption wing , reaching velocities up to @xmath125 . at the closest observation times , phases 0.985 and 1.115 ,",
    "this broad absorption does not exist .",
    "though the blue wing is of slower velocities than observed in the he  i  @xmath0 line , a resemblance between the two is very likely .",
    "both lines show a high velocity absorption component just before periastron , which later disappears . like the he  i  @xmath0 line",
    ", it is possible that the h@xmath121 absorption line originates in the conical shell , but in regions with higher density and lower velocity .",
    "we note that qualitatively similar blue absorption wing close to periastron passage also appears in the h@xmath119 and paschen  @xmath1 lines , although less prominent ( davidson et al . 2005 ; for the h@xmath119 this trend is better seen in the animation prepared from these observations ) .",
    "note that in the last periastron passage of 2009 the h@xmath119 ( observed by richardson et al .",
    "2010 ) blue wing absorption component is not prominent , but it may exist and be difficult to see .",
    "we here check whether an alternative absorbing material for the he  i  @xmath126 can be a collimated fast wind or a jet emitted from the secondary .",
    "behar et al . ( 2007 ) analyzed _ chandra _ meg / heg observations in the @xmath127 band , where high excitation s , si and ar lines are observed .",

    ", there is some difficulty in adopting the jet explanation for he  i  @xmath126 line absorption at high blue velocities . at phase @xmath134 ,",
    "@xmath138 days before periastron , the accretion process have not yet started ( kashi & soker 2009a ) , and hence an accretion disk around the secondary which is essential for producing jets does not exist .",
    "this is also supported by the x - ray flux which is strong and raising at phase @xmath134 , while weaker and decreasing at phase @xmath130 ( corcoran 2010 ) , suggesting that substantial accretion has not yet started according to the accretion model ( soker 2005 ; kashi & soker 2009a ) .",
    "we therefore regard the explanation of a fast wind from a jet as the absorbing material for the he  i  @xmath126 unlikely .",
