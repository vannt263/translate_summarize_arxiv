    "quasiperiodic tilings have been widely studied over the past decades , their main interest lying in their guessed relation with real quasicrystalline alloy@xcite atomic structure . indeed , most of the specific features and physical properties associated with quasiperiodic order ( electronic structure , localized phason degree of freedom , nature and dynamics of dislocations , ... ) are already present in these simplified models . the two standard ways to generate these tilings are the cut and project method@xcite which relate them to selected pieces of higher dimensional lattices , and the grid algorithm@xcite which insists on a dual picture of intersecting lines or planes . in both cases ,",
    "one obtains structures made up of different types of tile which are segments in @xmath3 , rhombi in @xmath1 and rhombohedra in @xmath2 .",
    "the simplest ( and most famous ) examples correspond to tilings with two differents tiles ( the one - dimensional fibonacci chain , the penrose ( pentagonal)@xcite and amman - beenker@xcite ( octogonal ) two - dimensional tilings and the icosahedral @xmath2 tiling ) although other quasiperiodic structures with more different types of tile have also been proposed . in @xmath4",
    ", all these tilings display a complex local order with various coordination number .    concerning the study of the physical properties ( spectrum , eigenstates , conductivity , ... ) , it has been proved more efficient to consider simpler systems such as direct products of periodic chains@xcite embedded in a quasiperiodic potential .",
    "the main advantage of these structures is that their characteristics ( sub - ballistic transport , self - similar eigenstates ) can be easily deduced from the @xmath3 case  ; on the other hand , since all the sites have the same coordination number , their topology is trivial . in @xmath1 ,",
    "penrose - like tilings have nevertheless been studied revealing the same type of features@xcite , but in @xmath2 , the incidence of the topological quasiperiodicity on the electronic properties has been poorly investigated@xcite essentially because of the geometrical complexity . in this context , it would be appreciable to have simple structures susceptible to provide a better framework for such studies .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present new quasiperiodic tilings ( of arbitrary dimension ) following from a natural extension of the fibonacci sequence , which allow for a coherent indexing of the sites while keeping some of the interesting self - similar properties of the penrose - like tilings .",
    "we give the procedure to build any approximant of these topologically non trivial tilings using the conumbering scheme@xcite . in the quasiperiodic limit , these tilings are closely related to those initially considered by rauzy@xcite in two dimensions and will therefore be called generalized rauzy tilings . in the first part",
    ", we recall the principle of the conumbering scheme that allows to generate all the sites of any codimension one structures by iterating the so - called generating vector @xmath5 . as an illustration",
    ", we apply this scheme to build the well - known fibonacci chain for which it is possible to exactly determine the coordinates of @xmath5 . in the second part",
    ", we generalize these results in higher dimension and we describe , in details , the characteristics of the generalized rauzy tilings in @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the site coordinates are explicitely obtained in terms of the generalized fibonacci numbers . in the third part",
    ", we give the connectivity matrix of these canonical tilings that is relevant for tight - binding electrons problems .",
    "the derivation of the structure factor is given in the fourth part .",
    "finally , we propose , in the appendix , a dual point of view in which the @xmath3 quasiperiodic system presented have a high codimension although based on the same type of sequence .",
    "in the cut and project algorithm commonly used to build quasiperiodic structures , one considers a @xmath6-dimensional hypercubic lattice and @xmath0-dimensional subspace that define the  physical \" space . the @xmath7-dimensional subspace define the perpendicular space whose dimension is called the codimension .",
    "thus , @xmath0-dimensional codimension one tilings are generated from a @xmath8-dimensional hypercubic lattice .",
    "the unidimensional character of the perpendicular space of these tilings provides a natural ordering of the sites which amounts to classify them according to their local environment  : two sites with close coordinates in the perpendicular space have a similar neighbourhood .",
    "as shown below , each site of a codimension one tiling can actually be indexed by a unique coordonnate , its conumber , that is related to its position in the perpendicular space . for any approximant structure , this is achieved by using a generating vector which , upon simple iteration , fully determines the coordinates of the sites inside the unit cell@xcite . since this method is valid for any approximant , the quasiperiodic structure can therefore be approached asymptotically .    to illustrate this mechanism , we shall focus on the @xmath9 case .",
    "we consider a square lattice , and draw a line through the origin @xmath10 , denoted @xmath11 ( the parallel or physical space ) , of rational slope @xmath12 , with @xmath13 and @xmath14 mutually prime ( see figure [ fibo_chain ] ) .",
    "the sites of the approximant structure are obtained by an orthogonal projection on @xmath11 of the square lattice sites contained inside the semi - open band generated by sliding the unit square along @xmath11 .",
    "since @xmath11 has rational slope , it contains a set of regularly spaced sites of the square lattice which defines a unit cell with @xmath15 sites and a cell vector @xmath16 .",
    "we define the so - called generating vector @xmath5 as the vector of smallest norm@xcite , joining the origin to the square lattice site closest to @xmath11 ( but not belonging to @xmath11 ) .",
    "it can then be shown@xcite that the sites inside the band are obtained by successive translations of @xmath5 ( _ modulo _",
    "@xmath17 )  : @xmath18 \\mbox { . } \\label{conum_coord}\\ ] ] this indexation by a unique coordinate ( the conumber ) provides a natural ordering with respect to the distance ( before projection ) from the parallel space , _ i.  e. _ with respect to the local environment .",
    "note that the origin has , by definition , the conumber @xmath19 . for arbitrary sequences of approximants ,",
    "the generator coordinates are given by a specific element of the farey tree decomposition@xcite but , for particular rational slopes , it is possible to explicitely write down the generating vector as we shall now see for the fibonacci chain .",
    "+ we denote by @xmath20=@xmath21 the canonical orthonormal basis of the square lattice , and consider the vector @xmath22 whose coordinates in @xmath20 are given by @xmath23 .",
    "the index @xmath24 refers to the approximant order and the fibonacci sequence @xmath25 is defined as follows  : @xmath26 usually , this sequence is only defined for @xmath27 but , here , we shall also consider negative values of @xmath28 .",
    "as readily seen on the recursion relation ( [ recur ] ) @xmath29 where the golden mean @xmath30 is the pisot@xcite solution of the quadratic equation @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath32 is then defined as the vector of smallest norm@xcite with integer coordinates perpendicular to @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath34 forms a basis of the so - called trace lattice @xmath35 .",
    "one also defines the band lattice @xmath36 generated by @xmath37 and the vector @xmath38 ( see figure ( [ fibo_chain ] ) for @xmath39 ) .",
    "let @xmath40 ( resp .",
    "@xmath41 ) be the matrix transforming the canonical basis @xmath20 into the @xmath35 ( resp .",
    "@xmath42 ) basis . the number of sites of the square lattice contained in the @xmath43 ( resp .",
    "@xmath41 ) unit cell thus reads @xmath44 ( resp .",
    "@xmath45 ) . to determine the coordinate of the generating vector @xmath46",
    ", we introduce the matrix  @xmath47  : @xmath48 that verifies the golden mean equation  : @xmath49    the powers of @xmath47 can be expressed in terms of the fibonacci numbers  : @xmath50 note that we also allow the index @xmath51 to be negative . since the first column of @xmath52 represents the coordinates of @xmath33 , it comes immediately that the second line of @xmath53 gives the coordinates of @xmath32 in the basis @xmath20  : @xmath54 the matrices @xmath40 and @xmath41 thus reads  : @xmath55 to determine the number of sites in the @xmath36 unit cell , one can either directly compute @xmath56 or one can remark that this number is also given by the scalar product of @xmath57 and @xmath33 .",
    "one thus readily obtains  : @xmath58 to determine @xmath46 , one uses the fact that the quadrilateral generated by @xmath32 and @xmath46 should have a unit area since it can not contain a lattice site ( except on its boundary ) . since @xmath37 corresponds to the second line of @xmath53 and since @xmath59 , the first line of @xmath53",
    "can be chosen to be the coordinates ( in the basis @xmath60 of the generating vector  : @xmath61 the coordinates of the sites contained in the @xmath36 unit cell ( sites of the approximant structure before projection ) , read in the basis @xmath62  : @xmath63 \\mbox { . } \\ ] ] the @xmath64 operator allows to carry back all the sites in the same elementary cell of the band lattice . in the basis @xmath34  of the trace lattice @xmath35",
    ", the coordinates finally write  : @xmath65\\mbox { , }   \\label{modulo1}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 represents the fractional part of the @xmath67 coordinates .",
    "the interest of introducing the trace lattice is that the coordinates of the sites after projection onto @xmath68 are readily given by the first component of @xmath69 expressed in the @xmath34 basis .    in the next section ,",
    "we propose to generalize the above construction to codimension one structures in any dimension , such that the perpendicular direction is related to generalized fibonacci numbers .",
    "these numbers are obtained from the pisot solution of the polynomial equation @xmath70 , the @xmath71 case giving the golden mean .",
    "the first geometrical construction based on the roots of this equation ( for @xmath72 ) was proposed in 1982 by the mathematician g. rauzy@xcite .",
    "detailed analyses of these original tilings focusing on their self - similar properties and their fractal boundaries can be found in refs.@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the tilings that we describe thereafter are different although close to those initially studied . indeed",
    ", the construction proposed by rauzy does not rely on the standard cut and project algorithm since the sites of the cubic lattice chosen for the projection step are contained in a cylinder centered around the perpendicular direction and not in the band lattice . in addition , the construction of the approximant structures is completely new . + in order to show the simplicity of the generalization , we will use , in the following , the same notations for the @xmath73 tilings as for the @xmath9 tilings .      as for the @xmath9 case",
    ", we shall use the conumbering scheme to generate the @xmath74 approximant structures .",
    "we endow the standard cubic lattice of a canonical orthonormal basis @xmath75 and , by analogy with the fibonacci chain , we choose as perpendicular space the direction defined by vector @xmath76 where the generalized fibonacci sequence @xmath77 is defined as follows  : @xmath78 as previously , the ratio of two successive elements of this sequence converges toward an irrational limit  : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the pisot root of the cubic equation @xmath81 .",
    "we introduce the matrix @xmath47  : @xmath82 which satisfies @xmath83 , and whose successive powers read  : @xmath84 below are shown the first ( positive and negative ) powers of @xmath47 which display a remarkable pattern on both parts of the identity matrix @xmath85 .",
    "@xmath86 note that the vertical sequences of numbers , in each column , obey relation ( [ recurrauzy ] ) from bottom to top . to build the @xmath87 order approximant ,",
    "one remarks that @xmath22 corresponds to the first column of @xmath52 so that the two vectors @xmath88 and @xmath89 which generate the parallel space are directly obtained from the second and third line of @xmath53  : @xmath90 @xmath91 defines a basis of the trace lattice @xmath35  ; the band lattice @xmath42 is generated by @xmath92 and the vector @xmath93 , which joins the origin to the extremity of the unit cube whose projection onto @xmath22 has the highest positive magnitude .",
    "the number of sites in a @xmath42 unit cell is given by  : @xmath94 the generating vector @xmath46 is determined by the condition  : @xmath95 .",
    "since @xmath96 , one can identify the coordinates of @xmath46 with the first line of @xmath53  : @xmath97 and the coordinates ( before projection ) of the sites contained in a @xmath42 unit cell read in the basis @xmath98  : @xmath99 \\mbox { . }",

    "figure [ rauzy_app ] displays an elementary cell of the @xmath107 order approximant .    in the initial cubic lattice ,",
    "each site is six - fold coordinated so that , after projection , the coordination number @xmath108 is such that @xmath109 .",
    "however , as discussed below , the tilings generated here only have sites with @xmath110 .",
    "the simplicity of the above construction results directly from the particular properties of the generalized fibonacci numbers .",
    "it can therefore easily extended to codimension one tilings of any higher dimension .",
    "thereafter , we briefly describe the three - dimensional case and the @xmath0-dimensional case .",
    "the construction in the @xmath111 case is based on the pisot root of the equation  : @xmath112 whose approximants define the perpendicular space direction in the @xmath113 space .",
    "the associated generalized fibonacci sequence @xmath114 is defined by  : @xmath115 and the @xmath47 matrix satisfying ( [ r3eq ] ) reads  : @xmath116 so that  : @xmath117 the @xmath87 order approximant is obtained by choosing the vector @xmath118 whose coordinates are given by the first column of @xmath52 .",
    "the three parallel space vectors reads  : @xmath119 that are respectively the second , third and fourth line of @xmath53 . the band lattice @xmath42 is generated by @xmath120 and the vector @xmath121 .",
    "the number of sites in the @xmath42 unit cell ( and therefore in the approximant unit cell ) is given by  : @xmath122 and the coordinates of the generating vector are given by the first line of @xmath53  : @xmath123 the sites coordinates have an expression similar to eq.([expression ] ) where @xmath124 is , as before , built from the coordinates of @xmath125 and @xmath22 .",
    "+ the generalization in any dimension @xmath6 is straightforward considering the pisot root of the equation  : @xmath126 the remaining of the construction follows mechanically .",
    "+ let us end this section by remarking that nothing prevents , in any dimension , to map the whole structure along a direction such that all tiles ( rhombus in @xmath1 , rhombohedra in @xmath2 ) are identical up to rotations .",
    "indeed , once the sites have been generated with a given choice of the perpendicular space , this can be achieved by projecting perpendicularly to the direction of the vector @xmath57 whose each coordinate equals 1 . in that case , all the sites are mapped onto the full set of simple lattice vertices ( triangular in @xmath1 and centered cubic in @xmath2 ) with missing edges .",
    "we are then left with a quasiperiodic decoration of a periodic structure , which has the same connectivity but a different geometry as the above discussed tilings .",
    "such deformations might be useful in some context , like for instance when one aims to build row - by - row or plane - by - plane transfer matrices , in which case the preexisting reticular stratification of the lattice can be very helpful .",
    "in this section we write down the so - called connectivity or adjacency matrix @xmath127 of codimension one tilings .",
    "this matrix is defined by the following rule  : @xmath128 if sites @xmath129 and @xmath130 are nearest neighbours ( _ i .",
    "e. _ connected by an edge ) and zero otherwise .",
    "such a matrix is of special interest for the study of the electronic or phononic excitations in tight - binding like approaches . in this case",
    ", the hamiltonian is , indeed , simply proportional to k. being able to easily obtain such a matrix may therefore be highly valuable .",
    "the idea consists in labelling the sites with respect to their conumber . as discussed in section ii",
    ", this indexation classifies the sites according to their coordinate in the perpendicular space direction , or equivalently , in terms of their local environment .",
    "this implies that the conumber difference between two nearest neighbour sites along a given direction is a constant @xmath64 the number of sites in the unit cell .",
    "this difference is readily obtained from the projection onto the perpendicular space of each edges meeting at any site of the initial hypercubic lattice .",
    "it is therefore sufficient to determine , for a given site , the conumber of its nearest neighbours , to write down the full connectivity matrix as a band ( tplitz - like ) matrix .",
    "we shall first illustrate this method with a fibonacci chain approximant , defined by the perpendicular space vector @xmath131 and determine the conumber of the nearest neighbours of the origin . in the canonical basis @xmath132 of the square lattice ,",
    "these sites have the following coordinates @xmath133 and @xmath134 . their projection onto the perpendicular space is given ( up to a sign ) , in the trace lattice @xmath35 basis , by @xmath135 .",
    "in addition , and by construction , one has @xmath136 in the @xmath35 basis .",
    "one therefore deduces that the conumber of the sites which are nearest neighbours of the origin ( once carried back in a unique unit cell ) reads @xmath137 et @xmath138 .    as an example , we give the connectivity matrix @xmath127 of the @xmath139 order approximant of the fibonacci chain displayed in figure ( [ fibo_chain ] ) with periodic boundary conditions : @xmath140 there are indeed @xmath141 sites in the elementary cell and the conumber of the origin neighbours are @xmath142 and @xmath143 ( see fig . [ fibo_chain ] ) .",
    "the above discussion applies to the generalized rauzy tilings  : their connectivity matrix remains a band matrix once the sites have been ordered according to their conumber .",
    "the conumbers of the origin s nearest neighbours are still given by the coordinates of @xmath22 which are expressed in terms of the generalized fibonacci numbers .",
    "we display below the connectivity matrix of the @xmath139 order approximant of the two - dimensional generalized rauzy tiling , with periodic boundary conditions  : @xmath144 one has @xmath145 sites in the unit cell , and the conumber of the origin s nearest neighbours are @xmath146 , @xmath147 , and @xmath148 .",
    "one can therefore appreciate the advantage of this family of tilings that provides topologically non trivial structures which are nevertheless very easy to construct and to encode . especially in @xmath2 ,",
    "this is undoubtlessly one of the simplest type of connectivity matrix that one could expect for quasiperiodic structure approximant of any order .",
    "+ the last point we would like to discuss concerns the proportion of the different types of site and their coordination number . clearly , the coordination number of site @xmath130 is the number of @xmath149 in the @xmath104 line of the connectivity matrix @xmath127 .",
    "hence , in the above example one finds four @xmath150-fold coordinated sites , five @xmath151-fold coordinated sites , and four @xmath152-fold coordinated sites but no @xmath153-fold coordinated sites .",
    "it is easy to show that the condition to have sites of maximal coordination number @xmath154 in a generalized rauzy tiling of type @xmath155 reads  : @xmath156 but looking to the definition of the generalized fibonacci sequence @xmath25 in the @xmath6-dimensional case  : @xmath157 \\:\\:\\ : \\mbox{and } \\:\\:\\ :   f_{0}=f_{1}=1 \\mbox { , } \\ ] ] one can easily prove , by recursion , that the condition ( [ condition ] ) is never fulfilled .",
    "this is in contrast with the two - dimensional tilings originally introduced by rauzy and discussed in ref.@xcite that displayed @xmath153-fold coordinated sites .",
    "the simple form taken by the codimension 1 tiling sites coordinates is very helpful to compute the structure factor ( which amounts here to the fourier transform of the site distribution ) .",
    "indeed , the existence of a generating vector allows to write the structure factor as a geometric serie@xcite . denoting by @xmath51 the number of sites in a unit cell and assuming that the sites ( atoms ) have the same form factor , the structure factor @xmath158 reads  : @xmath159 where @xmath160 is a reciprocal space vector of the approximant structure and where @xmath161 represents the vector associated to the site @xmath130 ( after projection ) . in the codimension one case",
    ", we have seen that the coordinates were simply expressed in terms of the generator @xmath5  : @xmath162\\mbox { . } \\label{conum_coord}\\ ] ] this expression slighly differs from ( [ babar ] ) since here , @xmath163 and @xmath5 denotes the vectors after projection .",
    "in addition , the sites are not carried back in the unit cell through the _ modulo _ operation , but since one only considers reciprocal space vector , this does not affect the result .",
    "thus , the structure factor @xmath158 simply writes  : @xmath164 the peak intensities ( think of a diffraction experiment ) are proportional to  : @xmath165 in the quasiperiodic limit , the reciprocal space unit cell shrinks toward zero , and the fourier spectrum becomes dense .",
    "however , going from an approximant to the next one mostly amounts to add new peaks of smaller and smaller intensities while letting almost unchanged the previous peaks .",
    "this is why any threshold function filtering out the peaks below a certain ( arbitrary ) value gives rise to a point - like diffraction pattern ( see figure ( [ tf_rauzy ] ) for an approximant of a two - dimensional generalized rauzy tiling ) .",
    "note that the fourier spectrum does not display a particular point - like rotational symmetry ( except the trivial parity @xmath166 ) , in constrast with the more commonly studied octagonal and penrose quasiperiodic tilings which have higher codimension ( 2 and 3 respectively ) .",
    "the generalized rauzy tilings form a canonical set of codimension one quasiperiodic structures .",
    "their construction is based on the generalized fibonacci sequence , whose properties allow for a rather simple method to get the sites coordinates as well as their coordination number .",
    "we have shown how to get closed formulas for these quantities valid for any approximant structures , and which therefore can be carried up to the quasiperiodic limit .",
    "the unidimensional nature of the perpendicular space allows one to write down the connectivity matrix in terms of tplitz band - like matrix , the position of the non vanishing band being directly determined from the generalized fibonacci numbers .",
    "these properties should rank this family of tilings among the most interesting to be studied . as shown recently@xcite",
    ", they are , to many respect , much simpler than the celebrated penrose - like tilings , while displaying the same kind of physical properties . +   +",
    "we would like to thank p. arnoux , n. destainville and l. vuillon for very fruitful discussions about rauzy original works .",
    "up to now , we have described @xmath0-dimensional codimension one structures with a perpendicular space built from the generalized fibonacci series .",
    "but nothing prevents to build , along the same line , one - dimensional structures made up of @xmath167 different edges , by switching the respecting role of the perpendicular and parallel space .",
    "let us briefly describe the obtained sequences and start by discussing the @xmath168  case .",
    "note that the length of the @xmath173 sequence is given by the generalized fibonacci numbers f@xmath174 .",
    "the sequences follow a concatenation rule @xmath175 and the number of occurences of @xmath170 ( resp .",
