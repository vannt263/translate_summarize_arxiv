    "the bandwidth of 50 mhz corresponds to a velocity coverage of only 350 km s@xmath18 at 43 ghz , which is further reduced by bandpass roll - off at the band edges . while this is comparable to the co ( 54 ) line fwhm of 420 @xmath5 60 km s@xmath18",
    ", some emission in the line wings will be lost . since these correlator limitations preclude a meaningful determination of the line profile , we chose to observe in continuum mode , using 2 ifs with 2 polarizations each .",

    "no emission is seen in the off image at the position of the quasar , to a 2@xmath48 upper limit of 0.24 mjy .",
    "the co source s observed brightness temperature is 0.12 k. the co emission region is spatially unresolved , with an upper limit to its size of @xmath8 determined from gaussian model fitting .    the velocity - integrated line intensity for the co ( 21 ) line from bri  1335@xmath10417 is 0.32@xmath50.06 jy km s@xmath18 , corrected for the 37@xmath44 missing from the vla bandpass . using the co ( 54 ) data of guilloteau et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , we determine a velocity - integrated co ( 21)-to-(54 ) line flux ratio of 8.7@xmath51.9 . this value is roughly consistent with the constant brightness temperature value of 6.25 ( i.e. integrated line flux increasing as @xmath49 ) expected for optically thick emission in both lines , for a fixed source size .    extrapolating the dust continuum spectrum from 230 ghz , where 8 mjy are observed ( guilloteau et al . 1997 ) , to 43 ghz using a spectral index of + 3.25 , one calculates an expected continuum flux density of 34 @xmath36jy at the latter frequency , which is well below our noise level of 0.12 mjy in the off - line channel .",
    "the critical question concerning bri  1335@xmath10417 is whether the dust and radio continuum emission are powered by the agn , or star formation , or both . fig .",
    "2 shows the integrated spectral energy distribution for bri  1335@xmath10417 for rest frame frequencies from 7.6 ghz up to 4600 ghz , normalized to the spectrum of the nuclear starburst galaxy m82 . for demonstrative purposes",
    "we have quantified the spectrum of m82 using two accurate polynomial fits : one to the synchrotron emission which dominates at frequencies below 100 ghz , and a second to the thermal dust emission which dominates above 100 ghz .",
    "all the data points for bri  1335@xmath10417 fall within 2@xmath48 of the m82 curve .",
    "the agreement between the sed of bri  1335@xmath10417 and m82 argues in favor of star formation playing the dominant role in heating the dust and powering the radio continuum emission from bri  1335@xmath10417 , although we can not preclude a contribution from the agn .",
    "it is important to note that , while the shapes of the seds are similar , the luminosity of bri  1335@xmath10417 is 1.2@xmath50 ergs s@xmath18 hz@xmath18 at 1.47 ghz in the rest frame of the source , assuming a radio spectral index of @xmath51 , while that of m82 is a factor 1400 lower ( assuming a distance of 3 mpc to m82 ) . for comparison ,",
    "the rest frame 1.47 ghz luminosity of bri  1335@xmath10417 is a factor 40 larger than that of arp 220 , and even a factor 2 larger than that of the nearby low luminosity radio galaxy m87 .",
    "if the emission is powered by star formation , a very rough estimate of the massive star formation rate in bri  1335@xmath10417 can be derived from the radio and submm continuum emission using equations 1 and 2 in carilli & yun ( 1999 ) .",
    "both values are consistent with a star formation rate of 2300@xmath5600 @xmath7 yr@xmath18 .",
    "we emphasize that this is at best an order - of - magnitude estimate .",
    "that the co ( 21 ) and ( 54 ) lines from bri  1335@xmath10417 have , within the uncertainties , equal brightness temperature implies that the molecular gas must be fairly warm , with a lower limit to the rotational temperature of 30 k set by the excitation of the co ( 54 ) line , and that the line emission is optically thick .",
    "our vla imaging implies an upper limit to the co source size of @xmath8",
    ". a lower limit to the source size can be derived assuming a single , homogeneous , optically thick emitting region ( ohta et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the beam filling factor is given by : @xmath52 = @xmath53 , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the source and beam solid angles , respectively , @xmath56 is the observed line brightness temperature ( 0.12 k ) , and the line excitation temperature , @xmath11 , is assumed to be equal to the intrinsic ( rest frame ) source brightness temperature .",
    "this calculation leads to a minimum source diameter of @xmath57 .",
    "an interesting problem that has arisen in the study of extreme nuclear starburst galaxies is that the implied gas mass is comparable to , or sometimes greater than , the dynamical mass ( tacconi et al . 1999 ; bryant &  scoville 1996 ; ohta et al .",
    "1996 ; scoville , bryant , &  yun 1997 ; downes &  solomon 1998 ) .",
    "bri 13350417 is an extreme example of this `` excess mass '' problem . from the co(2 - 1 ) luminosity we estimate a molecular gas mass , @xmath3(h@xmath4 ) , of 1.5@xmath50.3 @xmath6 , using equation 5 in solomon , radford , and downes ( 1992 ) , which assumes the standard galactic gas mass - to - co luminosity conversion factor .",
    "we have also included an upward correction to the mass of 30@xmath44 arising from the fact that the line brightness temperature is measured relative to that of the microwave background radiation .",
    "this correction factor is 30@xmath44 for a gas at 50 k at z = 4.4 . using the upper limit to the source radius of @xmath58 or 2.25 kpc , and assuming a rotational velocity of 200 sin@xmath59 km  s@xmath18 , where @xmath15 is the disk inclination angle with respect to the sky plane , leads to an upper limit to the dynamical mass of @xmath60 sin@xmath61 . comparing this to the gas mass leads to an upper limit to the inclination angle of @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath62 .",
    "the fact that the source is a broad line qso is consistent with a disk rotation axis oriented within @xmath63 of our line of sight ( barthel &  miley 1989 ) .",
    "however , the persistence of this mass problem for a number of sources is becoming difficult to reconcile with all the sources being close to face - on .    for high redshift sources , gravitational lensing could act to magnify the co emission , leading to an overestimate of the gas mass .",
    "however , for bri 13350417 there is thus far no evidence for multiple imaging due strong gravitational lensing .",
    "another way to mitigate the excess mass problem is to adjust the cosmological parameters .",
    "however this would require a decrease in the luminosity distance , i.e. an increase in @xmath30 or @xmath31 , which would be contrary to current observational evidence ( peebles 1999 ; turner 1999 ) .",
    "perhaps the most likely cause for the excess mass problem is that applying the galactic gas mass - to - co luminosity conversion factor causes an overestimate of the gas mass for extreme objects such as bri 13350417 .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that assumptions underlying the standard galactic conversion factor involving co emission from a conglomeration of many small , highly optically thick clouds lead to overestimates of the gas mass by a factor 3 or more relative to a single homogeneous disk model ( combes , maoli , &  omont 1999 ; downes &  solomon 1998 ; solomon et al .",
    "1997 ) . assuming a factor 3 decrease in the gas mass leads to an upper limit to the inclination angle , @xmath15 , of @xmath64 .",
    "overall , a combination of small inclination angle plus a lower gas mass - to - co luminosity conversion factor may be sufficient to solve the excess mass problem for bri 13350417 .",
    "nevertheless , it appears likely that in this source the dynamical mass is dominated by the molecular gas mass on scales of a few kpc .",
    "bri  1335@xmath10417 has similar properties to the well - studied qso br  1202@xmath10725 at @xmath65 , including ( i ) similarity of the sed with that of the starburst galaxy m82 ( kawabe et al .",

    "1999 ) , ( ii ) similar dust and gas masses ( ohta et al . 1996 ; omont et al .",
    "1996b ) , ( iii ) a similar massive star formation rate as derived from the radio continuum and dust emission ( kawabe et al . 1999 ) , ( iv ) a constant brightness temperature for the co emission , at least up to the ( 54 ) transition ( kawabe et al .",
    "1999 ) , and ( v ) similar optical spectra , in particular , strong associated absorption lines suggesting a gas - rich environment ( storrie - lombardi et al .",
    "kawabe et al . ( 1999 ) have made a detailed comparison between the co emission from br  1202@xmath10725 and that from the starburst nucleus in m82 .",
    "the nucleus of m82 also shows constant brightness temperature up to co ( 54 ) ( gsten et al .",
    "1993 ) . from this comparison , kawabe et al .",
    "conclude that at least half of the molecular gas mass has a temperature between 50 k and 70 k and a density between 10@xmath66 @xmath67 and 10@xmath68 @xmath67 .",
    "the pressure in the molecular gas is then a few times @xmath69 dyn @xmath70 .",
    "such high pressures have been proposed for massive nuclear starburst regions in nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( condon et al .",
    "1991 ) .",
    "a significant difference between bri  1335@xmath10417 and br  1202@xmath10725 is that the latter is a double source with a separation of 4@xmath71 in the cm and mm continuum as well as in co line emission ( omont et al .",
    "1996b ; yun et al . 1999 ) , while bri  1335@xmath10417 appears unresolved at arcsecond resolution .",
    "it has been argued that the double structure of br  1202@xmath10725 is caused by gravitational lensing , which might lead to an overestimate of this source s intrinsic dust and gas masses and star formation rate by an order of magnitude ( omont et al .",
    "however , the lensing hypothesis is complicated by the fact that the optical qso is a single source ( hu , mcmahon , &  egami 1996 ) .",
    "if bri  1335@xmath10417 is gravitationally lensed , the multiple images must be separated by less than 1@xmath71 .",
    "tan , silk , &  blanard ( 1999 ) have presented a model of the star formation history of the universe which may explain the faint source counts from the optical through the radio regimes .",
    "they hypothesize that star formation occurs in two phases . at high redshift ( @xmath72 ) , very active star formation occurs in merger events leading to the formation of the spheroidal components of galaxies ( spiral bulges and ellipticals ) . at lower redshift ( @xmath73 ) ,",
    "the stellar disks of galaxies are formed over longer periods at lower star formation rates .",
    "the high @xmath0 starbursts are dusty systems and are revealed primarily as constituents of the faint submm , ir , and radio source populations .",
    "in contrast , the faint optical source counts are dominated by the lower @xmath0 disk - forming systems .",
    "tan et al .",
    "state that the early spheriods may act as `` seeds '' for disk formation as gas falls in , and that the present - day stellar mass in bulges and halos is comparable to that in disks .",
    "our observations of bri  1335@xmath10417 are consistent with this source being a member of the high @xmath0 starburst population .",
    "these data support the speculation by omont et al .",
    "( 1996b ) that : `` ... the emergence of quasars at very high redshift is connected with the onset of galaxy formation , possibly with the formation of the cores of elliptical galaxies '' .",
    "overall , the cm and mm continuum observations , as well as the co line data , argue in favor of a very massive starburst concurrent with the agn activity in bri  1335@xmath10417 at @xmath74 .",
    "the gas depletion timescale is short , @xmath42 10@xmath22 years , in which time a significant fraction of the stars in the host galaxy of the agn may be formed ( benford et al . 1999 ) .",
    "further observations are required to understand the nature of bri  1335@xmath10417 , including : ( i ) high resolution imaging with the vla of the radio continuum emission to search for multiple imaging due to gravitational lensing on a scale of a few hundred mas , and/or to search for evidence of a radio jet , ( ii ) vla imaging at 100 mas resolution of the co emission to resolve the optically thick line emitting regions , and ( iii ) observations of higher order co transitions to constrain the temperature of the molecular gas .",
