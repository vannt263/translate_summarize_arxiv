    "such a central limit theorem is not always true when the action of @xmath18 is only assumed to be irreducible : in this case the variables @xmath34 still converge in law but the limit is not always a gaussian variable ( see example  [ exanongau ] ) .",
    "we will deduce easily a multidimensional version of this clt ( theorem  [ thcltmatbis ] ) and interpret it as a clt for real semisimple groups ( theorem  [ thcltmatter ] ) , generalizing goldsheid and guivarch clt in @xcite .",
    "most of our results are true over any local field @xmath35 with no changes in the proofs .",
    "let us give a historical perspective about this theorem .",
    "the existence of such a `` noncommutative clt '' was first guessed by bellman in @xcite .",
    "such a theorem has first been proved by furstenberg and kesten in @xcite for semigroups of positive matrices under an @xmath36 assumption for some @xmath37 .",
    "it was then extended by le page in @xcite for more general semigroups when the law has a finite exponential moment , that is , when there exists @xmath38 such that @xmath39 .",
    "thanks to later works of guivarch and raugi in @xcite and goldshed and margulis in @xcite , the assumptions in the le page theorem were clarified : the sole remaining but still unwanted assumption was that @xmath2 had a finite exponential moment .",
    "hence , the purpose of our theorem  [ thcltmat ] is to replace this finite exponential moment assumption by a finite second moment assumption .",
    "such a finite second moment assumption is optimal .",
    "partial results have been obtained recently in this direction .",
    "tutubalin in @xcite has proved theorem  [ thcltmat ] when the law @xmath2 is assumed to have a density .",
    "jan in his thesis ( see @xcite ) has extended the le page theorem under the assumption that all the @xmath40-moments of @xmath2 are finite .",
    "hennion in @xcite has proved theorem  [ thcltmat ] in the case of semigroups of positive matrices .",
    "there exist a few books and surveys ( @xcite , @xcite or @xcite ) about this theory of `` products of random matrices . ''",
    "this theory has had recently nice applications to the study of discrete subgroups of lie groups ( as in @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "these applications motivated our interest in a better understanding of this clt .",
    "the method we introduce in this paper is very flexible since it does not rely on a spectral gap property . in the forthcoming paper @xcite",
    ", we will adapt this method to prove the clt in other situations where the clt is only known under a finite exponential moment assumption :    the clt for free groups due to sawyer  steger in @xcite and ledrappier in @xcite .",

    "we explain now in few words the strategy of the proof of our central limit theorem  [ thcltmat ] .",
    "we want to prove the central limit theorem for the random variables @xmath41 where the quantity @xmath42 controls the size of the element @xmath43 in @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath44 be the projective space of the vector space @xmath45 . since this function @xmath46 on @xmath3 is closely related to the `` norm cocycle '' @xmath47 given by @xmath48 for @xmath43 in @xmath3 and @xmath49 in @xmath50 , we are reduced to prove , for every @xmath51 in @xmath52 , a central limit theorem for the random variables @xmath53 .",

    "these spectral properties might not be valid under a finite second moment assumption .",
    "this is where our strategy differs from the classical strategy : we solve this cohomological equation by giving an explicit formula for the solution @xmath64 in terms of the @xmath65-stationary measure @xmath66 on the dual projective space @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the image of @xmath2 by @xmath69 .",
