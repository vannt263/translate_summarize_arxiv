    "+ * about the choice of a height function . *",
    "+ for certain simple surfaces , e.g. , convex surfaces diffeomorphic to a 2-sphere , there is no bad embedding since the height - function @xmath22 always shows up a strict minimum and a strict maximum .",
    "such a height function is also a _ perfect morse function _ ,",
    "i.e. a morse function with exactly 2 critical points attached respectively to a strict minimum and a strict maximum . for a surface of genus",
    "0 we can still have several critical points at the same critical value .",
    "this is not generic and unstable under a small perturbation of @xmath22 .",
    "the first embedding ( here @xmath22 is the axe of symmetry ) is not favorable : the set of critical point consists of @xmath165 circles .",

    ", we can here anyhow apply the results of @xcite or@xcite .",
    "if we still assume that conditions @xmath88 and @xmath91 are satisfied , each of these circles contributes as a 1-dimensional submanifold in the 4-dimensional phase space : @xmath167 for the circle of minima and : @xmath168 for the circle of minima . observe that the order w.r.t",
    "@xmath4 is now @xmath169 .",
    "here @xmath172 is the ratio of the eigenvalues of the linearized operator in the transverse direction to @xmath173 evaluated at the point @xmath174 .",

    "observe that , only from the spectral estimates , we can still see :        for a generic choice of the metric @xmath116 on @xmath179 the function @xmath180 is not constant along @xmath178 .",
    "unfortunately , the spectrum of the associated schrdinger operator @xmath181 only determines the average of the density along the circles .",
    "to get a better description here requires to perform eigenfunction estimates .",
    "see , e.g. @xcite for this point .      * a singularity of type @xmath182 : strict minimum , * a singularity of type @xmath183 : first saddle point , * a singularity of type @xmath183 : second saddle point , * a singularity of type @xmath184 : strict maximum .",
    "this gives : @xmath185 the situation of the second embedding is generic and stable ( e.g. , w.r.t .",
    "a little deformation of the height function ) .",
    "this allows to retrieve @xmath179 , up to a smooth deformation .",
    "results concerning morse - functions are not specific to height - functions and proposition [ genus of surfaces ] can be generalized to @xmath186 where @xmath6 is a morse - function on @xmath1 .",
    "the interest here is the evident physical interpretation : the choice of @xmath187 , @xmath188 is equivalent to put a particle , forced to move freely on @xmath1 along geodesics , in a constant gravitation field . also a height - function gives a function independent of the choice of the metric on @xmath1 .",
    "for example , this is not the case of a potential @xmath189 depending ( locally ) on the geodesic distance @xmath190 on @xmath1 .",
    "such a potential depends on @xmath116 and can be singular at conjugate points .",
    "* convexity and measure .",
    "* + assume that @xmath191 then if @xmath1 is convex every choice of a height - function gives a perfect morse function .",
    "but if @xmath1 is not convex certain choice of the potential give locally a number of critical points greater than 2 , with the same morse index .    observe that we still get 3 critical points by a small change for @xmath22 and that we get an _",
    "open condition_. in general to detect the non - convexity of @xmath1 does not require global spectral - estimates .",
    "finally , for any gender @xmath158 observe that global spectral - estimates provide a lower bound for the euclidian diameter of @xmath1 since we can retrieve the maximum and the minimum of the restriction @xmath192 .",
    "this is just a lower bound as shows figure 1 .",
    "from the point of view of statistical mechanics it could be interesting to put a probability measure @xmath193 on all choice possible for @xmath22 and to average the spectral estimates with respect to @xmath194 .",
    "this is here simply equivalent to chose a probability measure on @xmath195 since the full problem is invariant under translation .",
