    "the wavelength coverage and sensitivity of the _ far - ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _",
    "( _ fuse _ ) opens new windows for the study of interstellar material toward fainter stars with more extinction than have been studied previously in the far - uv ( moos et al .",
    "2000 ) . in particular",
    ", this wavelength range gives access to the numerous transitions of molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath5 ) and deuterated molecular hydrogen ( hd ) below 1130   that can not be studied with other existing instruments .",
    "in addition , the sensitivity is much greater than previous instruments capable of observations at similar wavelengths such as _ copernicus _ and _",
    "orfeus_.    in snow et al .",
    "( 2000 ; hereafter paper i ) we presented an analysis of h@xmath5 for hd 73882 , the first translucent cloud line of sight observed with _",
    "fuse_. for this line of sight , with @xmath1 = 2.44 , we found an h@xmath5 total column density , log n(h@xmath5 ) = 21.08 , about 3 times as great as that found for lines of sight with @xmath1 @xmath2 1 .",
    "the hydrogen molecular fraction , @xmath11 , for hd 73882 was comparable to the largest values found for diffuse cloud lines of sight . in a companion paper ,",
    "ferlet et al .  ( 2000 ) presented an analysis of hd for the same line of sight , finding log n(hd ) = 16.1 , but with large uncertainty .",
    "again , this value is considerably larger than that found for @xmath3 oph - like lines of sight .",
    "the _ fuse _ translucent cloud survey program involves 36 lines of sight with @xmath1 = 15 , and is described in more detail in paper i. in the current paper we present our second analysis of h@xmath5 and hd from this program , for the line of sight toward hd 110432 . with @xmath1 = 1.32 , this line of sight represents the transition between diffuse clouds like those along the line of sight toward @xmath3 oph , and the translucent cloud lines of sight with larger extinction such as hd 73882 .",
    "given that some of the material that contributes to the extinction may not be co - spatial with the molecular gas , a larger @xmath1 does not guarantee that the h@xmath5 and hd measurements are sampling a different environment .",
    "good - quality data exist for hd 110432 for the entire wavelength range covered by _ fuse _",
    "( 9121187  ) , and this is the most complete study to date of h@xmath5 for a line of sight with significant reddening .    in   2",
    "we discuss previous measurements along this line of sight . in ",
    "3 we present a detailed description of our analysis procedures . in   4 , 5 , and 6 we present , discuss , and summarize our results , respectively .",
    "hd 110432 lies beyond the southern coalsack at a distance of 300 @xmath7 50 pc ( _ hipparcos _ ; esa 1997 ) . at @xmath16 = 5.24 , hd 110432",
    "is one of the brightest stars lying behind substantial interstellar material with substantial uv flux not observed by _",
    "while considering the material between us and the star , we must carefully consider the star itself .",
    "hd 110432 is a be star with a somewhat uncertain spectral type .",
    "literature values derived from photometry and spectroscopy range in subtype from o9 to b2 , and in luminosity class from iii to v. the ionized circumstellar material that gives rise to the emission - line behavior also contaminates determinations of interstellar color excess and extinction , fundamental parameters for the comparison of lines of sight .",
    "codina et al . ( 1984 ) derived @xmath0 = 0.40 and a spectral type of b0.5 iiie from _ iue _ spectra .",
    "however , they also derive a distance of 430 @xmath7 60 pc , somewhat larger than the _ hipparcos _ distance .",
    "seidensticker ( 1989 ) performed a comprehensive analysis of stars in the coalsack region , deriving @xmath0 = 0.52 for hd 110432 , a photometric spectral type of o9 ve , and a distance of 400 @xmath7 120 pc .",
    "however , the color excess was anomalously high for its distance relative to other stars in the immediate region .",
    "most interestingly , dachs , engels , & kiehling ( 1988 ) derived @xmath0 = 0.49 , but attributed 0.09 magnitudes of this color excess to the circumstellar material .",
    "the remaining color excess is identical to that of codina et al .",
    "( 1984 ) which was unaffected by the circumstellar material at such short wavelengths , and should reliably characterize the material producing the interstellar absorption lines . at the same time",
    "the _ total _ color excess agrees well with the value from seidensticker ( 1989 ) , whose method would have included the circumstellar component .",
    "we thus adopt @xmath0 = 0.40 to represent the interstellar material containing the h@xmath5 and hd .",
    "the uv photometric extinction curve for hd 110432 was classified as `` peculiar '' by meyer & savage ( 1981 ) .",
    "the normalized extinction , @xmath17 , for this line of sight is much smaller than the galactic average , particularly for the shortest wavelength measurements at 1550 and 1800  .",
    "this result suggests a much above - average value of total - to - selective extinction , @xmath18 .",
    "however , as we have already noted , the be nature of this star must be considered .",
    "meyer & savage ( 1981 ) used @xmath0 = 0.51 , but with our preferred interstellar value of @xmath0 = 0.40 , the interstellar extinction curve appears much closer to the galactic average .",
    "part of this correction may be offset by adjustment of @xmath16 in the calculation of @xmath19 , but even this effect is fractionally smaller for a fixed @xmath20 at the shorter wavelengths due to the larger color excesses at those wavelengths .    the wavelength of maximum polarization , @xmath21 , has been shown to be linearly correlated with @xmath18 ( serkowski , mathewson , & ford 1975 ) .",
    "in addition , while the observed polarization towards be stars may be influenced by local polarization of circumstellar material , this effect is small in the face of substantial interstellar material , and should not affect @xmath21 ( whittet & van breda 1978 ) .",
    "serkowski et al .",
    "( 1975 ) found @xmath21 = 0.59 @xmath22 m , corresponding to @xmath18 = 3.3 , slightly larger than the galactic average of 3.1 .",
    "combined with our adopted color excess , we obtain @xmath1 = 1.32 , consistent with the value from seidensticker ( 1989 ) minus the effects of the circumstellar material .    the absorption along this line of sight is dominated by the coalsack , a prominent dark nebula centered near the same ra and dec as hd 110432 .",
    "the distance to the nebula has been derived by photometric analysis of stars in the field by many authors .",
    "the value of 174 @xmath7 14 pc from the early photographic study of rodgers ( 1960 ) has held up well .",
    "franco ( 1989 ) derived 180 @xmath7 26 pc from photoelectric data .",
    "seidensticker & schmidt - kaler ( 1989 ) considered more stars and found evidence for two sub - clouds at distances of 188 @xmath7 4 and 243 @xmath7 14 pc with the latter cloud providing somewhat greater extinction than the former .",
    "the morphology of the extinction map agrees well with the co emission map of nyman et al .",
    "no matter what the true distribution of material may be , at 300 pc hd 110432 lies behind all of this material with very little extinction between the coalsack and the star .",
    "in addition , foreground material represents a small fraction of total absorption along the line of sight ( @xmath1 @xmath2 0.1 mag ; seidensticker & schmidt - kaler 1989 ) .",
    "an accurate assessment of the h@xmath5 velocity structure is crucial for the interpretation of the high-@xmath6 lines , and the resolution of the _ fuse _ spectra is generally insufficient for this purpose .",
    "since individual components typically have velocity spread parameters , @xmath13 @xmath2 12 km s@xmath23 , resolution of comparable magnitude is preferred .",
    "fortunately , hd 110432 has been observed at ultra high resolution ( @xmath24 = 0.3 km s@xmath23 ) , at optical wavelengths ( crawford 1995 ) .",
    "these observations provided velocity structures for ch , ch@xmath25 , , and .",
    "of most relevance to h@xmath5 are ch and .",
    "the ch observations reveal a simple velocity structure with just two components separated by 4.0 km s@xmath23 .",
    "the profile is somewhat more complex , with five components , dominated by two strong components separated by 1.3 km s@xmath23 .",
    "the combined profile of the two closely - spaced strong components plus one of the weak components rather closely matches the overall shape of the strong ch component .",
    "further , the profile of the remaining two weak components spans the same velocity range as the weaker ch component , albeit this latter component did not appear to be double .",
    "since the overall line profiles are generally similar , the `` effective '' @xmath13-values for the two profiles are also similar , 2.4 km s@xmath23 for ch and 2.1 km s@xmath23 for .",
    "given the low molecular hydrogen kinetic temperature we derive ( 63 k ; ",
    "4 ) , the velocity dispersion is dominated by turbulent motion and not thermal motion .",
    "thus , scaling the ch @xmath13-values to h@xmath5 according to mass only increases the effective @xmath13-values by about 10% , and these scaled values were used to generate the adopted component structure given in table 1 . while we use the ch structure to model the h@xmath5 structure , the structure would give similar results . in   4",
    "we describe two tests which support this choice of velocity structure for h@xmath5 .",
    "other species have been observed in absorption at resolutions of @xmath24 @xmath2 3 km s@xmath23 , and table 2 gives a summary of the column densities of previously observed molecules and atoms .",
    "as van dishoeck & black ( 1989 ) first pointed out , the column densities of molecules such as c@xmath5 , ch , and cn are more typical of diffuse cloud lines of sight such as @xmath3 oph , than translucent clouds .",
    "the value of n(co ) from codina et al .",
    "( 1984 ) is very uncertain , and in   5",
    "we derive a more precise value based on additional _ iue _ spectra unavailable to those authors , and revised oscillator strengths .",
    "millimeter - wave co measurements with a 43@xmath26 beam show little if any emission at the velocities of the previously mentioned absorption features ( gredel et al .",
    "1994 ) , but do show a strong component at @xmath27 = 5.1 km s@xmath23 ( @xmath28 = @xmath292.5 km s@xmath23 ) , about 5 km s@xmath23 blue - shifted from the bluest absorption components . as pointed out by crawford ( 1991 ) , the absorption line data support the conclusion of nyman et al .",
    "( 1989 ) that the co emission at this velocity near hd 110432 represents background material .",
    "hd 110432 was observed by _ fuse _ on 2000 apr 45 for a total of 3631 seconds spread across 5 short integrations . due to the relatively large uv - flux ,",
    "the data were recorded in spectral image mode ( moos et al .",
    "2000 ) . in this mode ,",
    "integration times are kept short to prevent detector and spacecraft motion from degrading the spectral resolution .",
    "excellent data were recorded on all 8 detector segments , with stellar signal recorded essentially down to the lyman limit as figure 1 indicates .",
    "the data were processed with version 1.6.9 of the calfuse pipeline , but we have used a later , improved version of the wavelength solution .",
    "we have co - added the 5 integrations for each segment , propagating the pixel - by - pixel uncertainties through the co - additions .",
    "given the differences in the wavelength scales and line - spread functions of the different detector segments , we have not combined data from different segments even though the wavelength ranges overlap .",
    "we emphasize that while the spectrum depicted in figure 1 was formed by combining all detector segments , this spectrum is primarily useful for display purposes and is not suitable for precise measurements .    with the full wavelength coverage of _ fuse _ available for this target , a wealth of information on h@xmath5 is available .",
    "the spectrum is dominated by the heavily damped and blended @xmath6 = 0 and @xmath6 = 1 lines from the lyman series ( b  x ) vibrational bands from ( 0,0 ) through ( 18,0 ) , and the werner series ( c  x ) vibrational bands from ( 0,0 ) through ( 4,0 ) . at shorter wavelengths ,",
    "the strongly damped lyman series lines become progressively more important .",
    "the h@xmath5 lines for @xmath6 = 2 also show damping wings , while the progressively weaker @xmath6 = 3 through @xmath6 = 7 line profiles are dominated by the apparently gaussian line spread function . given the various h@xmath5 line profiles encountered",
    ", we use multiple techniques to derive column densities , and we describe those techniques in detail as they will be used in the analysis of all additional targets in this program .    at total h@xmath5 column densities greater than @xmath2 10@xmath30 @xmath8 the overlapping profiles from adjacent bands conspire to create a spectrum where the true continuum level is never reached .",
    "figure 2 shows a normalized model spectrum for h@xmath5 corresponding to the @xmath6 = 0 through @xmath6 = 5 column densities we derive for hd 110432 .",
    "the effect of the overlapping bands is smallest for the longest wavelength vibrational bands due to the combination of having fewer contributing bands on the red side , and smaller oscillator strengths for these bands .",
    "shortward of 1010  , the effect is magnified by overlapping lyman and werner bands .",
    "most of our program stars have even larger column densities with correspondingly greater effect .",
    "an important consideration then is that the continuum can not be located _ a priori_.    thus , to determine the column densities for @xmath6 = 0 and @xmath6 = 1 , we must perform profile fits to as many vibrational bands as is practical , with the continuum being a fit parameter . however , there are several complicating factors .",
    "first , the saturated cores of @xmath6 = 0 and @xmath6 = 1 blends provide no leverage in the continuum determination .",
    "second , the h@xmath5 lines with @xmath6 @xmath31 2 , as well as lines from other species must be included in the fit .",
    "third , some h@xmath5 profiles are contaminated by stellar lines , as well as idiosyncrasies in the large - scale response of the detectors .",
    "fourth , the effects of @xmath6 = 0 and @xmath6 = 1 line wings from adjacent bands can not be ignored .",
    "finally , blends between the lyman and werner series h@xmath5 lines , and blends of h@xmath5 and lines limit the number of h@xmath5 bands that can be fitted with the highest accuracy .    to overcome the first factor",
    ", we must include a significant wavelength range in the fits , typically about 10   per band .",
    "for the second factor , we include all h@xmath5 lines up to @xmath6 = 5 , as well as identifiable lines of other atomic and molecular species .",
    "the weaker lines carry little weight in the overall fits , and they are not always modeled as accurately as if they were treated individually , but do allow for accurate continuum placement .",
    "to alleviate the other continuum problems , we removed the obvious stellar lines by dividing by an appropriate gaussian profile .",
    "also , we only fit one band at a time such that we can model the local continuum with a low - order polynomial . to overcome the fourth factor , we explicitly include the effects of all the @xmath6 = 0 and @xmath6 = 1 lines within 30   of the region we are fitting . as for the selection of h@xmath5 bands to fit , the lyman bands from ( 0,0 ) through ( 4,0 )",
    "are clean of werner bands and lines .",
    "each of these bands occurs in 2 , 3 , or 4 detector segments .    in the particular case of hd 110432",
    ", we were unable to obtain good fits for the ( 0,0 ) band , presumably due to stellar contamination in the lower portions of the wings , or at the narrow `` bump '' between the r(0 ) and r(1 ) lines . without resorting to unverifiable guesses as to the nature of contamination , or a full non - lte modeling of the stellar spectrum",
    ", we could not use this band for this line of sight .",
    "however , in other program stars with different ( generally earlier ) spectral types , this effect may not be important . even without the ( 0,0 ) band",
    ", we still have a total of 13 profiles from which to derive the low-@xmath6 column densities .",
    "figure 3 shows a sample fit of the ( 2,0 ) band covering the 10721082   region .    for @xmath6",
    "@xmath31 2 , the lines are weak enough that one can measure individual equivalent widths by fitting gaussian profiles to each line , or resolved blends of lines .",
    "these measurements are relative to the observed background level ; i.e. the @xmath6=01 line wings .",
    "we were able to measure at least one individual h@xmath5 line of @xmath6 @xmath31 2 from each lyman - series vibrational band from ( 0,0 ) through ( 18,0 ) , and from each werner - series vibrational band from ( 0,0 ) through ( 4,0 ) . in total",
    ", we obtained 249 equivalent width measurements for 99 h@xmath5 transitions . in 22 cases",
    ", we were able to measure a transition in the maximum possible 4 detector segments , and for all but 15 transitions we measured the line in at least 2 segments , allowing us to check the data for self - consistency .",
    "the lines of hd behave much like the high-@xmath6 lines of h@xmath5 . typically , the equivalent widths of the @xmath6 = 0 lines of hd are similar to those of the @xmath6 = 4 and @xmath6 = 5 lines of h@xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath6 = 1 lines of hd are considerably weaker , and conclusive detection of such lines in our _ fuse _ spectra will generally be difficult . for hd 110432",
    ", we obtained 24 equivalent width measurements for 8 @xmath6 = 0 lines , and none for @xmath6 = 1 .",
    "we determine an error estimate for each line measurement based on the formal uncertainty of the gaussian fit parameters , combined in quadrature with a formal estimate of the uncertainty in continuum placement .",
    "in combining measurements of the same line from different detector segments , we must be careful how we treat systematic differences .",
    "a simple weighted mean of the individual measurements will provide encouragingly small uncertainties when several measurements are combined , but if the actual values cover a large range , this reported uncertainty is not useful .",
    "however , the standard deviation is not useful considering the small number of measurements .",
    "the procedure we have adopted takes the largest of the three following numbers : one - half of the total range of measurements for a particular line ( a proxy for the standard deviation ) , the error we derive from a weighted mean , and 10 per cent of the weighted mean itself .",
    "the latter limit provides a conservative estimate of any systematic errors that we may not have considered .",
    "there are six pairs of detector segments whose wavelength coverage overlap . in comparing equivalent widths for the same line in these pairs of segments",
    ", we find excellent agreement with an exact one - to - one relationship .",
    "the only possible exception is for the sic 1a and sic 1b segments where the strongest lines were consistently measured to be 1015% stronger than in other segments .",
    "however , this only involves a half - dozen lines , mostly from @xmath6 = 2 where we used profile fitting for the final column densities , as discussed below .    from the final equivalent width measurements , and the assumed velocity structure , we construct a multi - component curve of growth .",
    "using the uncertainties of the individual lines , we perform a least - squares fit for each @xmath6 to determine n(@xmath6 ) for h@xmath5 and hd .",
    "the @xmath6 = 2 lines of h@xmath5 represent a special case .",
    "they are strong enough to have noticeable damping wings , yet the surrounding continuum is frequently not clean enough to allow accurate fitting of those wings with an individual damped voigt profile .",
    "the gaussian profile fitting , used in the measurement of the weaker lines , underestimates the equivalent widths of the strongest @xmath6 = 2 lines by as much as 1015% for hd 110432 , which corresponds to a 0.10.2 dex underestimate of the column density .",
    "however , the profiles of these damped lines are fitted well along with the @xmath6 = 0 and @xmath6 = 1 profiles , which gives us slightly better results than the curve of growth analysis for this particular line of sight .",
    "the confusion between the h@xmath5 bands and the lines makes a determination of n ( ) somewhat difficult using _ fuse _ data .",
    "however , this method may eventually produce accurate column densities , especially for cases where n ( ) @xmath32 n(h@xmath33 ) ; i.e. where the hydrogen molecular fraction is small . in the case of hd 110432 ,",
    "we have used _ iue _ spectra of lyman-@xmath10 to determine n ( ) .",
    "we co - added all 13 available swp spectra from the _ iue _ archive to improve the s / n .",
    "we used the technique of bohlin ( 1975 ) to determine the best column density by matching a pure damping profile to the observed line wings .",
    "the primary uncertainty in this method beyond the noise in the data is the presence of stellar lines in the wings of lyman-@xmath10 , particularly the blue wing . as we discuss in   4",
    ", the actual component structure can only have a small effect on the derived n ( ) .",
    "we begin with the results of the band - by - band profile fits .",
    "table 3 summarizes these results .",
    "fits of the same band in different detector segments show exceptional agreement .",
    "however , band - to - band differences exist . in all segments , the ( 3,0 ) band yields",
    "larger column densities for @xmath6 = 0 .",
    "the mean of the ( 3,0 ) values is about 0.15 dex larger than the mean from the other bands . the @xmath6 = 2 column densities are also slightly larger than those from the other bands , but the @xmath6 = 1 columns are not significantly larger .",
    "a visual inspection of the ( 3,0 ) band fits does not reveal an clear explanation for the differences , although one or more stellar lines may be the culprit .",
    "we have included these values in the final averages given in tables 3 and 4 although it may be appropriate to exclude this band in future studies .",
    "the reported uncertainties for @xmath6 = 02 are simply the sample standard deviation of the 13 individual values . if we exclude the ( 3,0 ) results , the uncertainty is cut in half for @xmath6 = 0 , while the average value decreases by 0.04 dex .",
    "figure 4 shows the 2-component curve of growth along with our averaged measurements of 99 h@xmath5 transitions and 8 hd transitions . since the uncertainties in n(@xmath6 ) for h@xmath5 lines of @xmath6 @xmath31 3 and",
    "the hd lines are affected by the shape of the curve of growth , we have given two - sided 1-@xmath34 error bars to these values in table 4 . for hd 110432 , most of the error bars do not show much asymmetry .",
    "we emphasize that the uncertainties in these values of n(@xmath6 ) only apply to the assumption that we have a perfect description of the component structure .",
    "changes in the component structure can produce changes in column densities when the lines lie on or near the flat portion of the curve of growth .",
    "for instance , if we had used the structure , our derived column densities for @xmath6 = 36 would be increased by 0.10 , 0.20 , 0.25 , and 0.10 dex , respectively .",
    "while these changes are modest , if we have seriously misjudged the h@xmath5 velocity structure , the changes could be much greater .    with this point in mind , we performed two additional tests of the validity of our assumed velocity structure . first , given the h@xmath5 equivalent width data , we fitted a single - component curve of growth , allowing both the column densities and the @xmath13-value to vary .",
    "the best - fit @xmath13-value , and in turn the column densities , were consistent with the `` effective '' @xmath13-value and column densities of the two - component model .",
    "second , we performed profile fits to several bands assuming a two - component structure with velocity separation given by the ch data , but allowing the @xmath13-values and relative strengths of the components to vary .",
    "again , the derived component parameters were consistent with the ch structure .",
    "both tests indicate that the changes in the column densities due to possible uncertainty in the component structure are not larger than the differences between the ch and structure indicated in the previous paragraph .",
    "our best curve - of - growth column density for @xmath6 = 2 is 18.55 , or 0.13 dex smaller than our profile fits , consistent with our previous discussion of the fitting of the @xmath6 = 2 lines .",
    "the column density for @xmath6 = 7 is based on only one very weak line .",
    "also , n(@xmath6=6 ) is based on just 4 weak lines with very little spread in @xmath35 .",
    "the small observed uncertainty thus may not be reliable .",
    "our fit of the lyman-@xmath10 line gives log n ( ) = 20.85 @xmath7 0.15 @xmath8 .",
    "we note that if instead of assuming a pure damping profile , we use the ch velocity structure and scale the b - values according to mass , log n would be about 0.05 dex smaller",
    ". however , even a slight increase in the complexity of the component structure relative to ch could decrease this difference to near zero .",
    "given the h@xmath5 column densities ( particularly for @xmath6 = 05 ) , and the column density , we can explore the physical conditions of the absorbing gas . when combined with log n ( ) = 20.85 @xmath7 0.15 @xmath8 , our total h@xmath5 column density of log n(h@xmath5 )",
    "= 20.68 @xmath7 0.05 @xmath8 gives a molecular fraction @xmath11 = 0.58 @xmath7 0.11 ; i.e.  between one - half and two - thirds of the observed hydrogen atoms exist in h@xmath5 molecules .",
    "at the relatively high densities assumed to exist in these h@xmath5 cloud(s ) , the ratio of n(@xmath6=1 ) to n(@xmath6=0 ) is considered an indicator of the kinetic temperature of the gas , and we derive @xmath36 = 63 @xmath7 6 k.    the excitation diagram in figure 5 shows the enhanced populations for @xmath37 relative to the kinetic temperature of the gas . this non - thermal excitation is usually interpreted as pumping by uv photons , followed by cascading transitions down through the various rotational states ( black & dalgarno 1973 ) .",
    "the high-@xmath6 lines in many lines of sight can be fitted by a single excitation temperature , i.e. a straight line in the excitation plot ( spitzer & cochran 1973 ) . for hd 110432",
    "such a fit for @xmath6 = 25 seriously overestimates n(@xmath6=3 ) , and in general the even-@xmath6 lines ( para - hydrogen ) appear slightly enhanced relative to the odd-@xmath6 lines ( ortho - hydrogen ) .",
    "however , good linear relationships do appear for @xmath6 = 13 and @xmath6 = 35 .",
    "for the former levels , we derive a temperature t@xmath38 = 110 @xmath7 5 k , and for the latter , we derive t@xmath39 = 240 @xmath7 40 k. an even less certain fit for @xmath6 = 37 corresponds to t @xmath15 350 k.",
    "several lines of sight with @xmath1 @xmath2 1 were observed with _ copernicus _ , @xmath3 oph being the prototype .",
    "we will present a detailed comparison of all lines of sight with @xmath1 @xmath4 1 , including more than a dozen of our _ fuse _ translucent cloud program stars in a future work ( b. l. rachford et al .",
    "2001 , in preparation ) . in the current paper",
    ", we will generally limit our comparisons to @xmath3 oph ( morton 1975 ; savage et al .",
    "1977 ) , hd 73882 ( paper i ) , and hd 110432 , with only brief references to the larger survey .",
    "relevant data for these lines of sight appear in table 5 .",
    "the lines of sight have similar total - to - selective extinction ratios , but cover a range of more than a factor of 2 in color excess and thus visual extinction .",
    "the kinetic temperatures of the three lines of sight are statistically identical .",
    "in addition , our preliminary survey of _ fuse _ translucent cloud program stars indicates h@xmath5 kinetic temperatures of @xmath260 k are typical for such lines of sight .",
    "the ratio n(h@xmath5)/@xmath1 lies within the range 3.55 @xmath40 10@xmath30 @xmath8 mag@xmath23 for all three lines of sight , and the molecular fractions are nearly identical as well .",

    "in particular , we see a large range in @xmath11 with a possible upper limit near 0.7 .",
    "if verified , this upper limit may provide important information on formation and destruction mechanisms at h@xmath5 column densities near 10@xmath41 @xmath8 .",
    "the combination of line saturation and the relatively limited range of log @xmath42 produces a very uncertain curve - of - growth value of n(hd ) that falls squarely between the values for @xmath3 oph on the low side , and hd 73882 on the high side .",
    "the hd / h@xmath5 ratio of 3 @xmath40 10@xmath43 falls well below the expected value of 2@xmath40d / h that would be observed if hd represents the primary reservoir of deuterium .",

    "= 16.0@xmath14 @xmath8 , with b - values of 1.4 and 1.2 km s@xmath23 for the blue and red components , respectively , and a much weaker blue component than for h@xmath33 .",
    "this result gives an overall hd / h@xmath5 ratio slightly smaller than typical values of 2@xmath40d / h .",
    "the hd / h@xmath5 ratio for the red component would be @xmath24 @xmath40 10@xmath44 , quite similar to 2@xmath40d / h . however , we emphasize that the uncertainty is about a factor of 2 .",
    "as depicted in figure 6 , the excitation of the high-@xmath6 levels of h@xmath5 is similar to , but slightly larger than that of @xmath3 oph ; yet is much smaller than hd 73882 .",
    "two factors control this excitation , the uv interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) and the number density .",
    "hd 110432 itself is an early enough star to excite h@xmath5 , and with the two - cloud structure of the coalsack proposed by seidensticker ( 1989 ) , the star lies 60 @xmath7 50 pc beyond the cloud at @xmath2240 pc .",
    "the other cloud , at @xmath2190 pc , would then lie 110 @xmath7 50 pc from the star . to estimate the effects of hd 110432 on the coalsack",
    ", we have taken fluxes at 1000   from an appropriate kurucz ( 1979 ) model for a b0.5 iii star ( t@xmath45 = 25000 k , log @xmath46 = 3.5 , solar metallicity ) , a stellar radius of 15r@xmath47 , and then compared the resultant radiation field at various distances from the star to the average isrf ( mathis , mezger , & panagia 1983 ) . assuming no dimunition of the stellar radiation field between the star and the cloud(s ) , we find that at about 40 pc from the star the stellar field is equal to the average isrf .",
    "we can then safely assume that hd 110432 does not contribute significantly to the radiation field of the cloud at 190 pc , but we can not make the same assumption about the other cloud . even if the material is more uniformly distributed between 180 and 250 pc , the same conclusion holds ; the material more distant from earth may be affected by the radiation field from hd 110432 while the material nearest to earth is not .",
    "we have searched the _ hipparcos _ catalog for other o and b stars in the region . in figure 7 , we present distances and spectral types for stars within about 6 degrees of hd 110432 .",
    "there are many stars much closer than the coalsack , and many more beyond the nebula , but few at the appropriate distances to be exciting the cloud(s ) along this line of sight . at 174 pc ,",

    ", the isrf impinging on the cloud(s ) containing h@xmath5 along the line of sight to @xmath3 oph is thought to be no more than twice the average field ( federman et al .",
    "1995 ) .    through observations of weak , rotationally excited c@xmath5 lines ,",

    "a similar analysis for @xmath3 oph ( van dishoeck & black 1986 ) gives an uncertain value @xmath48 @xmath15 200 @xmath50 .",
    "we have taken advantage of the amount of observational knowledge to run chemical models of translucent clouds .",
    "the basic assumptions are described in le bourlot et al .",
    "the model solves the radiative transfer as well as the chemical molecular formation / destruction mechanisms of a cloud containing h , c , n , o , and s species and a metal , illuminated by the isrf .",
    "the thermal balance can be solved in parallel to the chemical equilibrium .",
    "the original model , which was devoted to study the envelopes of molecular clouds , consists of a semi - infinite planar slab where the radiation field is impinging on one side of the cloud .",
    "the photodissociation of h@xmath5 is taking place through absorption in the discrete ultraviolet lyman and werner band transitions followed by continuous fluorescence .",
    "the photodissociation probabilities and the basic molecular properties of the lyman and werner band systems are accurately known from previous experimental and theoretical studies ( cf .",
    "roueff et al .",
    "1999 ; abgrall , roueff , & drira 2000 ) .",
    "such a model is very similar to other models of so - called photon dominated regions ( pdr ) ( see hollenbach & tielens 1999 for a recent review ) .",
    "it has been recognized recently ( le bourlot 2000 ) that ortho to para conversion of molecular hydrogen may occur on grains . moreover",
    ", the grain temperature depends critically on the photoelectric effect , i.e. on the actual value of the radiation field impinging on the grains at a certain location in the cloud . the models presented here follow the prescription of le bourlot ( 2000 ) and take into account the effect of the size distribution of the grains in the formation of h@xmath5 on the grains ( le bourlot et al .",
    "1995 ) as well as in the determination of their charge following bakes & tielens ( 1994 ) .    in order to apply the model to a diffuse cloud line of sight such as hd 110432 ,",
    "we have additionally introduced the deuterium chemistry and the detailed mechanisms implied in the formation and destruction of hd ( le petit , roueff , & le bourlot 2001 ; in preparation ) and we consider the cloud as a finite slab of constant density submitted to the same radiation field on both sides .",
    "the elemental abundances are the mean interstellar values given by savage and sembach ( 1999 ) .",
    "the cosmic ray ionization rate is chosen to be 5 @xmath40 10@xmath51 s@xmath23 , a mean value deduced from oh observations ( federman , weber , & lambert 1996 ) .",
    "we assign model parameters to reproduce several observational constraints ; namely , the hydrogen molecular fraction , the temperature - sensitive h@xmath5 column densities in @xmath6 = 0 and @xmath6 = 1 , and the total visual extinction .",
    "the ratio between the total hydrogen column density and @xmath1 we have derived , 1.26 @xmath40 10@xmath41 @xmath8 mag@xmath23 , is slightly smaller than average .",
    "the isrf may be somewhat larger than the mean standard value taken from draine ( 1978 ) but its actual value is not known .",
    "the peculiar character of the extinction curve in the ultraviolet is taken into account via the r@xmath52 value of 3.3 .    within the series of models we have run",
    ", we find that the two main constraints are fulfilled for a ratio of about 100 between the proton density @xmath53 and the multiplicative factor @xmath54 of the isrf in draine s units . indeed",
    ", the molecular fraction is directly proportional to @xmath48/@xmath54 .",
    "however , this agreement is obtained _ only _ when the minimum radius of the grains is larger than about 10@xmath43 cm .",
    "this fact should be compared with the peculiarity of the extinction curve : the larger than normal value of @xmath18 implies a far uv extinction lower than the mean value , in agreement with the absence of very small grains .",
    "this cut - off in the grain size distribution has two major effects , one on the formation rate of h@xmath5 and thus on the value of the molecular fraction , and the other on the temperature governing the ratio between the @xmath6 = 1 and @xmath6 = 0 column densities .",
    "table 6 gives the results of some typical models .",
    "the actual value of the isrf is not known but should not be larger than a few ; so a density of about 200 @xmath50 and a radiation field of about twice the standard isrf provides a reasonable compromise , in agreement with the density found from the study of the excitation of c@xmath5 . with these parameters , a column density of deuterated molecular hydrogen of 1.1 @xmath40 10@xmath55 @xmath8 is obtained , in agreement with the observations .",
    "in contrast , none of the models reproduces the column densities of the rotational levels of molecular hydrogen with @xmath6 @xmath56 2 as shown in table 7 .",
    "this not surprising due to the simplified geometry assumed .",
    "however , we feel that we address here a more fundamental failure of the chemical model .",
    "indeed , the presence of the ch@xmath57 molecular ion can not be reproduced by any pdr model and another chemical component is needed .",
    "this puzzle has been addressed by the presence of shocks ( pineau des forts et al .",
    "1986 ) or by the occurrence of dissipative structures due to interstellar turbulence ( falgarone , pineau des forts , & roueff 1995 ; joulain et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the presence of an intense far ultraviolet radiation field may also lead to an efficient formation mechanism of ch@xmath57 as suggested by snow ( 1993 ) .",
    "however , no obvious candidate for the production of intense ultraviolet radiation is available in the environment of hd 110432 .",
    "such a tiny component , whatever its origin , will enhance the populations of excited molecular hydrogen without modifying the populations of @xmath6 = 0 and @xmath6 = 1 .",
    "further modeling is beyond the scope of the present paper and will be performed subsequently .",
    "this modeling may also reveal the significance , if any , of the slightly enhanced column densities of para - hydrogen relative to ortho - hydrogen .    for comparison",
    ", it appears that the density in the clouds toward hd 73882 is larger than for the lines of sight toward @xmath3 oph and hd 110432 .",
    "an analysis of c@xmath5 gives @xmath48 = 350@xmath58 @xmath50 ( gredel , van dishoeck , & black 1993 ) .",
    "in addition , the column densities of @xmath6 = 4 and @xmath6 = 5 are the largest yet observed for any diffuse or translucent line of sight .",
    "this may suggest a very strong uv field , a distinct possibility considering that hd 73882 has a spectral type of o8.5 , even earlier than @xmath3 oph . as noted above",
    ", the current models are unable to reproduce the observed high-@xmath6 excitation , and thus an interpretation of the extreme excitation seen toward hd 73882 will require further work .",
    "the column densities of carbon - containing molecules along the line of sight toward hd 110432 , such as ch , ch@xmath57 , and c@xmath5 , more closely match those of diffuse clouds rather than translucent clouds .",
    "however , the co column density is rather poorly known and represents most of the carbon locked up in diatomic molecules .",
    "the millimeter wave observations of gredel et al .",
    "( 1994 ) reveal little if any co emission at the velocities of the absorption lines of ch , etc .",
    "codina et al .",
    "( 1984 ) observed several of the co absorption bands from the a ",
    "x series with _ iue _ and derived log n(co ) = 14.60 @xmath8 from a curve - of - growth analysis .",
    "this value was quite uncertain and depended on the then poorly - known velocity structure , and there have been subsequent revisions in the oscillator strengths for these bands .    in principle ,",
    "n(co ) can be determined from _ fuse _ data .",
    "easily visible co bands within the _ fuse _ wavelength range include b  x ( 0,0 ) at 1150  , c  x ( 0,0 ) at 1088  , and e  x ( 0,0 ) at 1076  .",
    "the c  x ( 1,0 ) band at 1063   , e  x ( 1,0 ) band at 1052  , and f  x ( 0,0 ) band at 1003   have @xmath59-values large enough to be visible , but are lost in or near the cores of strong h@xmath5 @xmath6 = 0 and @xmath6 = 1 lines .",
    "the c  x ( 0,0 ) band is contaminated by interstellar atomic lines ( @xmath601088.06 and others ) .",
    "several weak lines lie slightly blueward and redward of the b  x ( 0,0 ) band but reasonable fits can be obtained in hd 110432 . in the spectrum of hd 110432 ,",
    "the e  x ( 0,0 ) band lies in the blue wing of the @xmath6 = 0 line of the lyman ( 2,0 ) band of h@xmath5 , but is clean of narrow lines from other species .",
    "however , in lines of sight with much larger h@xmath5 column densities ( i.e. hd 73882 ) , this band is not visible .",
    "we performed profile fits of the b - x ( 0,0 ) and e - x ( 0,0 ) bands including all lines of @xmath61c@xmath55o and @xmath62c@xmath55o with @xmath63 using the ch component structure .",
    "we assumed a @xmath61c@xmath55o to @xmath62c@xmath55o ratio of 70 , a uniform rotational excitation temperature ( t@xmath64 ) for all levels , and used line parameters from zhong , et al .",
    "these fits yielded log n(co ) = 14.4 @xmath7 0.4 @xmath8 and t@xmath64 = 3.5 @xmath7 1.3 k. the velocity shift between the models and the spectra only differed from the shift derived from the h@xmath5 fits in this region by @xmath20.5 km s@xmath23 , implying that most or all of the co is co - spatial with those molecules .",
    "the ch component structure may not accurately represent the co component structure , similar to the situation for the hd molecule described earlier in this section .",
    "in fact , fits with a variable @xmath13-value did suggest a smaller velocity dispersion and somewhat larger column density .",
    "an extreme case would be if all the co lies within a single velocity component .",
    "thus , we performed fits assuming that the stronger ch component contains all the co. in this case , we derive log n(co ) = 15.0 @xmath7 0.5 @xmath8 .    the measurements of the a - x bands given by codina , et al .",
    "( 1984 ) were based on a single _ iue _ integration . as with our measurement",
    ", we have co - added the available _ iue _ spectrum to improve the s / n .",
    "this co - added spectrum allows us to much more precisely measure the equivalent widths of the a - x bands , and these measurements , along with 1-@xmath34 uncertaintines , are given in table 8 . with the 2-component ch model ,",
    "we derive log n(co ) = 14.35 @xmath7 0.15 @xmath8 . despite our use of smaller f - values",
    "( morton & noreau 1994 ) , in several cases our equivalent widths were considerable smaller than derived by codina , et al .",
    "( 1984 ) , and thus our column density is smaller than given by those authors . as with our profile",
    "fits , we also performed a curve - of - growth analysis assuming that only the stronger ch component contains co , and this analysis yields log n(co ) = 14.70 @xmath7 0.20 @xmath8 .    despite nearly identical values of n(h@xmath5 ) , n(co ) for hd 110432 is considerable smaller than for @xmath3 oph .",
    "the latter value was derived from high - resolution , high s / n spectra of the a ",
    "x bands with _ hst _ ( lambert et al . 1994 ) , and is a more precise measurement .",
    "however , even our less certain value for hd 110432 is clearly smaller than that for @xmath3 oph assuming the ch structure toward the former star .",
    "given the other similarities between the two lines of sight , this difference may indicate that indeed nearly all the co lies within a single velocity component , supporting the larger set of column densities we derived .",
    "the column density of the ch radical has been shown to correlate well with n(h@xmath5 ) in diffuse clouds ( danks , federman , & lambert 1984 ) and the data point for hd 110432 falls very near the best - fit relationship .",
    "interestingly , an extrapolation of this relationship into the realm of the translucent clouds provides an excellent match for hd 73882 as well .",
    "we have presented the first measurements of far - uv lines of molecular hydrogen for the line of sight toward hd 110432 ( @xmath1 = 1.32 ) .",
    "we derive a total h@xmath5 column density of log n(h@xmath5 ) = 20.68 @xmath7 0.05 @xmath8 .",
    "combined with log n ( ) = 20.85 @xmath7 0.15 @xmath8 , we derive a molecular fraction for hydrogen of @xmath11 = 0.58 @xmath7 0.12 .",
    "this value is similar to that found for the diffuse cloud line of sight toward @xmath3 oph and the translucent cloud line of sight toward hd 73882 .",
    "we find an h@xmath5 kinetic temperature of t@xmath9 = 63 @xmath7 6 k. this temperature is in agreement with those found for diffuse and translucent cloud lines of sight with log n(h@xmath5 ) @xmath4 20.5 @xmath8 .",
    "the excitation of the high-@xmath6 levels can not be well - represented by a single temperature model .",
    "a two - component model , with t@xmath38 = 110 @xmath7 5 k , and t@xmath39 = 240 @xmath7 40 k can account for the data , but does not necessarily have a physical significance .",
    "the even-@xmath6 ( para - hydrogen ) column densities appear slightly enhanced relative to the odd-@xmath6 ( ortho - hydrogen ) column densities .",
    "the column densities in each of the rotational states are statistically identical to those from @xmath3 oph .",
    "preliminary chemical modeling of the line of sight toward hd 110432 indicates that physical conditions are quite similar to that in the cloud(s ) toward @xmath3 oph .",
    "we derive an incident radiation field of about twice the interstellar average , and a density of @xmath2200 @xmath50 .",
    "the _ fuse _ spectra allow us to investigate the diatomic molecules hd and co. we obtain n(hd ) = 15.2@xmath12 @xmath8 from a curve - of - growth analysis of 8 @xmath6 = 0 lines , yielding an hd / h@xmath5 ratio of 3 @xmath40 10@xmath43 .",
    "this lies between that found for @xmath3 oph and hd 73882 , and is much smaller than the value implied by the d / h ratio , suggesting that most deuterium exists outside of hd molecules in the cloud(s ) toward hd 110432 .",
    "however , if hd and co follow component structures with smaller @xmath13-values than h@xmath5 , the column densities could be an order of magnitude larger .",
    "in particular , profile fits of the hd lines suggest smaller @xmath13-values as compared with h@xmath5 , and a column density log n(hd ) = 16.0@xmath14 @xmath8 . the stronger of the two hd components then gives an hd / h@xmath5 ratio very similar to 2@xmath40d / h .",
    "based on both a curve - of - growth analysis and profile fitting , we find log n(co ) @xmath15 14.3 @xmath8 if co follows the same component structure at ch , and log n(co ) @xmath15 14.8 @xmath8 if all the co is co - spatial with the stronger of the two ch components .",
    "overall , in terms of h@xmath5 , , carbon - containing molecules , and physical conditions , the line of sight toward hd 110432 appears very similar to that of @xmath3 oph , which has slightly less visual extinction . on the other hand",
