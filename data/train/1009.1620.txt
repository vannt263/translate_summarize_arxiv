    "techniques for estimating galaxies stellar masses are a crucial tool for understanding galaxies and their evolution .",
    "there are tight and well - defined correlations between stellar mass and many other important global properties like color , size , structure , metallicity , star formation activity , and environment ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "given a galaxy s stellar mass , @xmath0 , it is thus possible to predict a wide variety of global properties with considerable accuracy . in this sense ,",
    "stellar mass appears to be a key parameter in determining ( or at least describing ) a galaxy s current state of evolution .",
    "moreover , since the growth of stellar mass ( _ cf._absolute luminosity , color , etc . ) is relatively slow and approximately monotonic , stellar mass is a particularly useful parameter for quantifying galaxy evolution .",
    "stellar mass estimates , whether derived from spectroscopic or photometric spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , are plagued by a variety of random and systematic errors .",
    "these include a generic degeneracy between mean stellar age , metallicity , and dust obscuration .",
    "it is typical to make the simplifying assumptions that galaxies stellar populations can be described _ en masse _ ( _ ie .",
    "_ , neglecting age / metallicity gradients and complex dust geometries ) , and that galaxies complex star formation histories can be described parametrically .",
    "it is rare to attempt to account for active galactic nucleus ( agn ) emission . the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) ,",
    "including its universality or otherwise , remains a major ` known unknown ' . then there is the complication that different wavelengths probe different aspects of the stellar population",
    "; the inclusion of restframe uv or nir data can thus , in principle and in practice , have a large impact on the estimated stellar mass .",
    "these effects are compounded by uncertainties in the stellar evolution models themselves .",
    "a topical example is the importance of nir - luminous thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb ) stars : for the same data and stellar population parameters , the use of @xcite or @xcite models can change the derived value of @xmath0 by a factor of 3 for galaxies that host young ( @xmath15 gyr ) stars , but only if restframe nir data are included @xcite .",
    "@xcite have argued that the total random uncertainties in @xmath0 are on the order of @xmath16 dex for galaxies at @xmath17 .",
    "-1    for these reasons , it is essential to devise some way of assessing the quality of stellar mass estimates through comparison to some other fiducial mass estimate  this is the primary motivation for the present paper .",
    "specifically , using a number of the publicly available ` value added ' catalogs of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we will compare stellar mass estimates to total mass estimates derived from galaxy dynamics .    from the outset",
    ", we note that a difference between two quantities shows only that : a difference . with no definitive standard to use as a basis for comparison , the best that we can hope for is consistency between the two mass estimates .",
    "further , if and when there are differences , it is impossible to unambiguously identify where the ` fault ' lies  or even if there is indeed a fault .",
    "for example , it is likely that the ratio between stellar and total mass varies as a function of mass , and/or some other global property / ies .",
    "we will also explore this issue in some detail .",
    "-1    this kind of comparison has been done for sdss galaxies by @xcite , who considered both stellar mass estimates derived from the sdss spectra , as described by @xcite , and those derived using sed - fitting techniques that are commonly used at for higher - redshift studies .",
    "these authors find a relatively tight correlation between the two stellar mass estimates , with a mild systematic bias depending on h@xmath12 equivalent width ( ew ) .",
    "this bias suggests a potential problem with the stellar mass estimates as a function of specific star formation rate ( ssfr ) .",
    "further , both stellar mass estimates correlated well with the simple dynamical mass estimate , @xmath18 ( defined below ) , but showed a clear trend in @xmath6 with mass , such that less massive galaxies had higher values of @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite used the mass dependence of @xmath6 to argue for an increasing stellar - to - dark mass ratio for elliptical galaxies with higher masses , as did @xcite .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite have performed similar comparisons for @xmath19 galaxies , with similar conclusions .",
    "it is common practice to derive a simple dynamical mass estimate based on the velocity dispersion , @xmath3 , and the effective radius , @xmath4 , via the scalar virial theorem : @xmath20 ( this is the dynamical mass estimator used for each of the studies cited in the previous paragraph . )",
    "the constant @xmath21 is usually assumed to be in the range 35 , and is intended to account for the ` degree of virialization ' , including the effects of dark matter and the intrinsic shape of the velocity dispersion profile ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by assuming a constant @xmath21 for all galaxies",
    ", this expression implicitly assumes that all galaxies are dynamically homologous , or self - similar .",
    "but it is important to remember that the observed velocity dispersion is actually the luminosity - weighted mean of the true , radially - dependent velocity dispersion , projected onto the line of sight , and within the spectroscopic aperture .",
    "the shape of mass profile has a strong influence on the spatial and dynamical distribution of stellar orbits : in general , the relation between the observed velocity dispersion and the underlying mass profile thus depends on structure as well as size . as a dynamical mass estimator",
    ", @xmath18 can therefore only be considered as approximate .",
    "( the tilde in @xmath18 is intended to remind the reader of this fact . )",
    "@xcite provide an analytic expression that makes it possible to approximately account for this effect . using their formulation of the problem",
    ", the dynamical mass can be expressed as : @xmath22 here , the term @xmath23 encapsulates the effects of structure on stellar dynamics .",
    "( the subscript @xmath7 in @xmath9 is intended to make it clear that non - homology has been accounted for as a function of srsicindex , @xmath7 . ) for convenience , we will refer to @xmath9 as a ` structure corrected ' dynamical mass estimator , but we note that the inclusion of a structure - dependent term is not strictly a correction .",
    "@xcite also provide an analytical approximation for @xmath23 : -1 @xmath24 this expression for @xmath23 has been derived assuming a spherical mass distribution that is dynamically isotropic and non - rotating , and which , in projection , follows a @xcite surface density profile . for this ( admittedly simple ) scenario ,",
    "this approximate expression for @xmath23 is accurate at the percent level for @xmath25 . substituting trial values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 into equation",
    "[ eq : kvn ] suggests that the differential effect of non - homology on the inferred value of the dynamical mass is as much as a factor of 3 , or 0.5 dex .",
    "our first task in this paper , then , will be to explore the importance of structural differences between galaxies , using this prescription .    before we begin , note that there are alternative approaches to exploring the consistency between stellar and dynamical mass estimates .",
    "in particular , a number of authors have considered the relation between galaxies stellar and dynamical masses in the context of well known scaling relations between luminosity / mass and dynamics .",
    "for example , @xcite considered the relation between baryonic ( _ cf._stellar ) mass , @xmath28 , and circular rotation velocity , @xmath29 , for disk galaxies  the baryonic tully - fisher relation .",
    "these authors showed that stellar mass estimates based on different passbands ( _ ie._@xmath30 versus @xmath31 ) produced consistent @xmath28@xmath32 relations .",
    "furthermore , for a fixed imf , they argued that it was possible use a single color to estimate stellar mass - to - light ratios with an accuracy of 0.10.2 dex .",
    "there have also been a number of analogous studies for elliptical galaxies , based on the fundamental plane @xcite , which can be understood as a correlation between the dynamical mass - to - light ratio , @xmath33 , and surface brightness .",
    "these studies ( see , e.g. , cappellari et al .",
    "2006 ; and references therein ) have tended to focus on the ` tilt ' of the fundamental plane  that is , the deviation of the observed relation from the expectation assuming both a constant @xmath34 and structural and dynamical homology for all early type galaxies .",
    "the tilt of the fundamental plane thus offers a means of probing variations in @xmath33 ( including both variations in @xmath34 due to different stellar populations , and variations in @xmath35 due to , e.g. , different dark - to - luminous mass ratios ) and/or the degree of non / homology .",
    "while the relative importance of these different effects remains an open question , it seems clear that , at least for early type galaxies , both @xmath34 and @xmath35 vary systematically with mass ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this paper is structured as follows : in section [ ch : data ] , we describe the various sdss - derived catalogs that we will use , including the definition of our galaxy sample .",
    "we validate the velocity dispersion measurements used to derive dynamical masses in appendix [ ch : faber ] . in sections [ ch : results ] and",
    "[ ch : results2 ] , we present two parallel comparisons between stellar and dynamical mass estimates for galaxies in our sample .",

    "-1      there are two sets of redshift and velocity dispersion measurements given in the basic sdss catalog for dr6 and dr7 : the ` spectro1d ' values produced by the chicago group , and the ` specbs ' values produced by the princeton group . in terms of redshifts ,",
    "the two algorithms produce virtually identical results .",
    "the major difference between the two algorithms is that , whereas the chicago pipeline only gives velocity dispersion measurements to those galaxies that are spectrally classified as being ` early type ' , all galaxies are given a velocity dispersion measurement by the princeton pipeline . from dr6 , both the princeton and chicago velocity dispersion measurement algorithms have been updated , so as to eliminate the systematic bias at low dispersions identified by @xcite for the dr5 values . in appendix [ ch : faber ] , we compare both sets of velocity dispersions to those given by @xcite for bright , early type galaxies : in both cases , the values agree with the @xcite catalog values with an rms difference of @xmath38 km / s and no discernible systematic bias.-1    the default redshifts and velocity dispersions for in the sdss catalog ( specifically , using sdss parlance , the parameters ` z ` and ` veldisp ` given in the table ` specobjall ` ) are the chicago values . for the sole reason that princeton velocity dispersions are given for all galaxies ( rather than only the spectroscopically early - types )",
    "we have elected to use the princeton values instead ; these are also the measurements adopted for both the nyu and the mpa / jhu value added catalogs.-1    as we have mentioned in the introduction , the observed velocity dispersion is the luminosity weighted average within the ( projected ) spectroscopic aperture . in order to account for aperture effects",
    ", we have scaled the observed value , @xmath39 , for each galaxy to a central velocity dispersion , @xmath3 , which is defined to be that that would be observed within a circular aperture with a radius equal to 1/8 times the apparent effective radius , @xmath40 ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this correction has been made assuming @xmath41 ; _ ie .",
    "_ , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the radius of the sdss spectroscopic aperture .",
    "the scaling of @xmath44 has been derived by taking a luminosity - weighted integral of the spatially resolved velocity dispersions of galaxies from the sauron survey @xcite .",
    "the corrections themselves are small  the median correction is 0.02 dex , with an rms scatter of 0.02 dex  and does not have a major impact on our results . our qualitative conclusions do not change if we assume the slightly weaker radial dependence @xmath45 as found by @xcite , or if we neglect this correction altogether .",

    "this problem becomes progressively worse for larger @xmath7 , such that sizes are underestimated by @xmath48 % and fluxes by @xmath49 % for @xmath50 .",
    "have shown that this bias is produced by background over - estimation and over - subtraction in the vagc srsic  fits , owing to the use of a ` local ' , rather than a ` global ' background estimator .",
    "we note that there are rather large differences between the the srsicmagnitudes given by and the default ` model`magnitudes given in the sdss catalog .",
    "the ` model `  photometry is derived by making parametric fits to the 2d surface brightness distribution in each band , using the sector fitting technique described by @xcite .",
    "these fits assume either an exponential or a de vaucouleurs profile ; the profile shape is chosen based on the best - fit @xmath51 in the @xmath46-band .",
    "for galaxies that are best fit by a de vaucouleurs ` model ` we find @xmath52 , where @xmath7 is the srsic  index reported by g09 ; the scatter around this relation is at the level of 0.15 mag ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "that is , even where g09 find @xmath54 , their flux is approximately 0.26 mag brighter than the sdss ( de vaucouleurs ) ` model`flux ; this discrepancy is larger for larger values of @xmath7 . for this reason , we take the @xmath46-band srsic  magnitude from as a measure of total flux .",
    "-1    to derive a stellar mass , we then use @xmath34s taken from the mpa - jhu catalog ( dr7 ) , which is maintained by the garching group . note that , unlike previous mpa - jhu catalogs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the ` model `  seds are both aperture matched , and psf - corrected .",
    "] note , however , that the sed photometry has been corrected for emission lines , according to the line  to  continuum flux ratio in the spectroscopic fiber aperture ( we discuss the importance of this correction in section [ ch : starpops ] below ) .",
    "the sed fits are based on the synthetic stellar population library described by @xcite , which have been constructed using the @xcite stellar population models , assuming a @xcite stellar imf .",
    "these @xmath34s have been shown to be in good agreement ( rms in @xmath56 of @xmath57 dex ) with the spectrally - derived values described by @xcite for dr4 .",
    "our decision to rely on the srsic  structural parameters derived by restricts us to working with their sample .",
    "our rationale for this decision is that , in our estimation , the g09 srsic  fits are the most robust that are presently available . -1",
    "the g09 sample was constructed with the specific goal of exploring differences in the sizes and structures of ` central ' and ` satellite ' galaxies in groups and clusters . to this end",
    ", they selected 911 @xmath58 ` centrals ' as the first - ranked ( in terms of @xmath0 ) group / cluster members from the @xcite group catalog , which was in turn constructed from the dr4 nyu vagc .",
    "these galaxies were selected to have a flat logarithmic distribution in halo mass in the range @xmath59m@xmath60  @xmath61 ( 800 galaxies ) , plus 100 galaxies in the range @xmath62 m@xmath60  @xmath63 , and all 11 central galaxies in clusters with @xmath64m@xmath60  @xmath65 . in this way , the central galaxy sample was constructed to span a representative range of ( large ) halo masses .",
    "g09 also construct two @xmath58 ` satellite ' control samples , in which the satellite galaxies are selected to match the central galaxies .",
    "for the first of these , satellites are chosen to match centrals in @xmath0 to within 0.08 dex ; in the second , satellites are also required to match centrals to within 0.03 mag in @xmath66 color . because more massive galaxies are more likely to be ( counted as ) centrals , not every central has a satellite counterpart within these limits : the matching is more than 90 % successful for @xmath67 m@xmath60 , and less than 10 % successful for @xmath68 m@xmath60 .",
    "the two satellite samples , so constructed , consist of 769 and 746 galaxies , respectively .",
    "g09 exclude a number of these galaxies from their analysis because of confusion , leaving a sample of 879 central galaxies , and two samples of 704 and 696 satellites each .",
    "while duplicates are not allowed within the individual satellite samples , some galaxies do appear in both samples ; combining the two satellite samples we have 1167 unique galaxies .",
    "we exclude a further 71 galaxies whose spectra are not deemed ` science worthy ' by the sdss team ( _ ie . _",
    "the flag ` scienceprimary ` is set to zero ) . in order to avoid very large errors in the dynamical mass estimates ,",
    "we also exclude 160 galaxies that have relative errors in their velocity dispersion measurements that are greater than 10 % .",
    "this requirement excludes mostly low-@xmath7 and low-@xmath0 galaxies : the vast majority of these 160 galaxies have @xmath69 m@xmath60  and @xmath70 .",
    "our results do not depend on these selections .",
    "we are thus left with a sample of 1816 galaxies , of which 784 have been selected as central galaxies , and 1032 have been selected as being satellites of comparable mass . -1",
    "the major disadvantage to using the g09 sample is that the relative number of central / satellite galaxies is not at all representative of the general galaxy population .",
    "however it is worth noting that g09 have shown that , at least for structurally early type galaxies , and after matching both color and mass , there are no differences in the sizes and structures of central and satellite galaxies .",
    "they thus conclude that the distinction between central and satellite has no impact on galaxy structure .",
    "this already suggests that the g09 sample may be adequately statistically representative of the massive galaxy population .",
    "-1    even so , we will explicitly examine the possible role of sample selection effects in shaping our results in section [ ch : bias ] by comparing different subsamples from within the combined g09 sample .",
    "further , in appendix [ ch : others ] , we analyze a more general galaxy sample , using structural parameters from either the nyu vagc srsic  fits or the sdss de vaucouleurs / exponential ` model `  fits .",
    "in this section and the next , we present parallel comparisons between stellar mass and two different estimates of dynamical mass . as we have said in the introduction , it is common practice to obtain a simple dynamical mass estimate based on @xmath3 and @xmath4 alone , using the scalar virial theorem ; _ viz . _",
    "@xmath71 . in section [ ch : raw ] , we directly compare the values of @xmath0 and @xmath18 for the galaxies ; we will assume @xmath72 .",
    "we will then argue in section [ ch : structure ] that the agreement between stellar and dynamical mass estimates may be significantly improved if we allow for non - homology . to test this idea , in section [ ch : results2 ]",

    ", for galaxies in the sample .",
    "the black points show the data themselves ; the red points with error bars show the median and 16/84 percentile values of @xmath0 in narrow bins of @xmath18 ; the heavy dashed line shows a log - linear fit to the data , with the form and parameters as given . _",
    "while there is a relatively tight correspondence between @xmath0 and @xmath18 , the relation is clearly non - linear_. further , for @xmath73 m@xmath60 , @xmath0 appears to exceed @xmath18 for the majority of galaxies , which is logically inconsistent .",
    "we explore these results in greater detail in figures [ fig : rawsides ] and [ fig : rawcond ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : corrd ] , we show how these results change if we account for structural and dynamical non - homology in our estimates of dynamical mass .",
    "[ fig : raw],width=332 ]     in * figure [ fig : raw ] * , we compare the values of the simple dynamical mass estimator , @xmath18 , to the values of @xmath0 for galaxies in the g09 sample .",
    "the first thing to notice is that there is a relatively tight but clearly nonlinear relation between @xmath18 and @xmath0 , such that @xmath74 with @xmath75 .",
    "moreover , this simple analysis suggests that for many galaxies , including the majority of galaxies with @xmath73 m@xmath60 , @xmath0 actually _ exceeds _ @xmath18 .",
    "this is logically inconsistent , and necessarily implies a problem in the calculation of @xmath0 and/or @xmath18 .",
    "before discussing this result further , it is appropriate to make a few comments about the random errors in our estimates of @xmath0 and @xmath18 . in particular , it is important to realize that the errors in @xmath40 , @xmath47 , and @xmath7 are strongly covariant : for example , an error in the structural index will affect the values of both @xmath40 and @xmath47 . because @xmath0 depends on the measured value of @xmath47 , and @xmath18 on the measured value of @xmath40 , @xmath0 and @xmath18 are thus also covariant .",
    "this makes the seemingly trivial task of fitting a line to the observed @xmath0@xmath18 relation rather problematic . to do this properly",
    "would require full and consistent treatment of the covariant uncertainties in the srsic - fit parameters , but this information is not given by .",
    "-1    our solution to this problem is simply to minimize the mean absolute perpendicular distance between the data and the fit .",
    "when doing so , we also use a ` sigma - clipping ' algorithm to avoid the influence of the most egregious outliers ; specifically , we iteratively exclude points that lie off the best - fit line by more than 5 times the rms offset . while the gradient of the best - fit line does depend on the fitting scheme used ( we will explore this in more detail in section [ ch : corrd ] ) , the best fit parameters are not strongly dependent on how aggressively we sigma - clip . in order to avoid strong covariances between the slope and intercept of the best - fit line , we actually compute the fit in terms of @xmath76m@xmath60 ) ; that is , we fit a relation of the form @xmath77 .",
    "statistical uncertainties on the fit parameters have been derived from bootstrap resampling .",
    "the best fit to the @xmath0@xmath18 relation , so derived , is shown as line heavy dashed line in figure [ fig : raw ] .",
    "the best fit parameters are @xmath78 and @xmath79 .    in * figure",
    "[ fig : rawsides ] * , we explore the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath18 in greater detail .",
    "the different panels of this figure show the difference between @xmath0 and @xmath18 as a function of several interesting global properties : ( from left to right ) galaxy mass , structure , dynamics , and surface density .",
    "it clear that that @xmath6 is strongly correlated with all four of these parameters . for each of the parameters shown ,",
    "the size of the median trend in @xmath6 across the sample is on the order of 0.5 dex , although it is slightly lower for @xmath0 and slightly higher for effective surface density .",
    "-1    to quantify this statement , we have again made fits to the data , assuming the form @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is an arbitrary value chosen to be close to the median value of the quantity @xmath82 for our sample . for these fits , in contrast to the previous section , we have minimized the mean absolute _ vertical _ offset between the data and the fit .",
    "again , we use a non - aggressive sigma - clipping scheme to exclude extreme outliers .",
    "( in all that follows , when considering the stellar - to - dynamical mass ratio , we will always fit in this way ; we will only use the minimum perpendicular distance algorithm described above when fitting the relation between stellar and dynamical masses . ) the best fit lines to the data , so derived , are shown as the heavy dashed lines in each panel ; the best - fit parameters are given in each panel .",
    "in the case of srsic  index , the scatter around the best fit relation is @xmath83 dex ; for the other three parameters it is slightly higher : @xmath84 dex.-1     is that we have used @xmath85 , with @xmath23 defined as in equation [ eq : kvn ] ; otherwise all symbols and their meanings are as in figure [ fig : raw ] . the key point to be made from this figure , in comparison to figure [ fig : raw ] , is that _ allowing for non - homology makes a big difference to the inferred dynamical masses _ , and so to the correspondence between stellar and dynamical masses",
    "further , we note that the apparent inconsistency whereby @xmath86 for @xmath87 m@xmath60  galaxies seen in figure [ fig : raw ] is no longer apparent . after accounting for structure - dependent differences in galaxies dynamics ,",
    "the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath9 is much more nearly linear .",
    "however it remains true that the difference between stellar and dynamical mass appears to grow with increasing mass .",
    "[ fig : corrd ] -1,width=332 ]      there are of course strong correlations between mass , velocity dispersion , surface density , and structure .",
    "it is thus possible that the apparent trend with any given parameter in figure [ fig : rawsides ] is ` spurious ' , in the sense that it is driven by a trend in another more ` fundamental ' parameter .",
    "we note that galaxies star formation activity and histories have been shown to correlate closely with all of mass , velocity dispersion , and surface density ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , with the assumption that @xmath88 , these three quantities are all related by factors of @xmath4 , which is also closely correlated with @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "but the fact that @xmath6 depends on galaxy _ structure _  and particularly the agreement between the observed trend and expectations derived from a simple dynamical model  immediately suggests that structure - dependent differences in galaxy dynamics may play a role in the results shown in figure [ fig : raw ] . with this in mind , in * figure",
    "[ fig : rawcond ] * we attempt to separate out the @xmath0 and @xmath7dependences of @xmath6 .",
    "specifically , we want to test the hypothesis that departure from linearity in the @xmath0@xmath18 relation seen in figure [ fig : raw ] is at least in part a function of structure , and not mass .",
    "-1    figure [ fig : rawcond]a shows @xmath6 as a function of @xmath0 ; the colored lines show the median relation in bins of srsic  index .",
    "the median relation between @xmath6 and @xmath0 has a rather similar slope for each different @xmath7 bin : @xmath6 does depend on mass .",
    "if the dynamical mass - to - light ratio were to depend on mass only , however , we would expect the relations for different srsic  indices to overlap .",
    "instead , the relations for each bin are clearly offset from one another .",
    "that is , at fixed mass , the scatter in @xmath6 is closely correlated with galaxy structure .",
    "-1            in figure",
    "[ fig : rawcond]b , we do the opposite : in this panel , we plot @xmath6 as a function of srsic  index , and the different lines show the median relation in bins of stellar mass .",
    "again , it is clear that @xmath6 depends on both @xmath0 and @xmath7 : the median relations for each different mass bin are roughly parallel , but offset from one another.-1    further , the different mass bins in figure [ fig : rawcond]b cover different ranges in srsic  index : where the lowest mass bin is dominated by galaxies with @xmath89 , the highest mass bin is dominated by @xmath90 galaxies .",
    "similar behavior can be seen in figure [ fig : rawcond]a : the lowest @xmath7 bin contains very few galaxies with @xmath91 m@xmath60 , and virtually all @xmath92 m@xmath60  galaxies are in the @xmath93 bin .",
    "that is , there is a correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath7 within our sample .",
    "because the trend is towards lower values of @xmath6 with increasing @xmath7 , this correlation contributes to the apparent mass dependence of the dynamical - to - stellar mass ratio .    again , the dynamical mass estimates used thus far have been derived under the assumption of dynamical homology ( _ ie . _",
    "@xmath94 is equal to 4 for all galaxies ) .",
    "the solid line in figure [ fig : rawcond]b shows the expected shape of the relation between @xmath6 and @xmath7 , derived from equation [ eq : kvn ] .",
    "the agreement between the observed relation between @xmath6 and @xmath7 and the expectations from this ( admittedly simple ) dynamical model immediately suggests that non - homology has an important effect on dynamical mass estimates .",
    "we note that both @xcite and @xcite have made a similar argument for the importance of non - homology based on the fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies ( see also section [ ch : discussion ] below ) . -1",
    "in this section , we investigate the potential impact of non - homology on the agreement between stellar and dynamical mass estimates . to this end , we repeat the comparisons between stellar and dynamical mass estimates presented above , using the structure corrected dynamical mass estimator , @xmath9 , in place of the simple estimate @xmath18 .",
    "we quantify the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath9 for our sample in section [ ch : corrd ] , and show in section [ ch : mstarn ] that allowing for non - homology considerably improves the correspondence between stellar and dynamical mass estimates .",
    "-1      in * figure [ fig : corrd ] * , we show the relation between stellar and dynamical mass for the sample , using the structure corrected dynamical mass estimator , @xmath9 ; this figure should be compared to figure [ fig : raw ] .",
    "it is immediately obvious that the correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath9 is much closer to linear than that between @xmath0 and the simple dynamical mass , @xmath18 .",
    "further , we note that the results are now logically consistent , in that @xmath95 for almost all galaxies .",
    "this is our most basic result : _ structure - dependent differences in galaxy dynamics can have a big impact on the inferred dynamical mass _ , and so the stellar - to - dynamical mass ratio .",
    "the best - fit parameters for the @xmath0@xmath9 relation are @xmath96 and @xmath97 , where we have used bootstrap resampling to estimate the statistical uncertainty . while the statistical errors in the fit parameters are impressively small , systematic errors are sure to dominate . to see this , consider what would happen if we were to impose a stellar mass limit @xmath98 in figure [ fig : corrd ] : we would only include those galaxies with @xmath99 that have high values of @xmath11 ; similarly , we would exclude those galaxies with @xmath100 that have low values of @xmath11 .",
    "this would lead to a significantly shallower best - fit slope to the @xmath11 relation . as a specific example , if we were only to consider galaxies from the sample with @xmath101 m@xmath60 , we would find @xmath102 . in this context , it is worth noting both that the scatter in the @xmath0@xmath9 relation appears appears to increase with decreasing mass , and that the lowest mass points in figure [ fig : corrd ] lie systematically above the best fit line .",
    "note that , while we have phrased this in terms of a mass selection effect , at least part of this effect is related to how we have fit for the slope of the @xmath0@xmath9 relation ; _ viz . _ , by minimizing the mean perpendicular distance between the data and the best - fit line .",
    "if we were instead to fit by minimizing the mean offset in @xmath11 as a function of @xmath0 , we would reduce our vulnerability to this effect .",
    "there are thus two effects that have the potential to systematically bias the measured slope of the @xmath0@xmath9 relation .",
    "we can obtain a simple estimate for the systematic error on the parameters @xmath103 and @xmath104 by re - fitting the @xmath0@xmath9 relations in different ways .",
    "if we fit by minimizing the mean vertical offset , @xmath105 , from the best - fit @xmath11 relation , we find @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "if instead we fit by minimizing the mean horizontal offset , @xmath108 , we find @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "that is , the systematic uncertainties related to the technique used to fit the @xmath0@xmath9 relation ( for this sample ) are on the order @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "-1    what about the systematic biases due to the particular mass distribution of galaxies in the sample ? to explore the importance of these effects in our measurement of the slope of the @xmath0@xmath9 relation , we have tried re - fitting the @xmath0@xmath9 relation , weighting each point according to its stellar mass .",
    "the specific weights have been derived through a comparison between the mass distribution of galaxies within the sample , in bins of @xmath113 dex , and the @xmath17 mass function of @xcite .",
    "we have chosen the weight for each galaxies so that that the weighted stellar mass distribution of the sample matches the ` real ' stellar mass function .",
    "this weighting scheme is akin to @xmath114 weighting , inasmuch as if one were able to derive @xmath115 values for the sample , one would hope to obtain similar values .",
    "re - fitting the sample using these weights , we find @xmath116 .",
    "the larger random error on this value in comparison to our fiducial values stems from the fact that the lower mass galaxies are given much greater weights ( by several orders of magnitude ) ; the inclusion / exclusion of these points in the bootstrap resampling thus has a major impact on the best - fit slope .",
    "the fact that using these weightings gives an almost perfectly linear relation between @xmath0 and @xmath9 is striking , but it is important to remember that this fit is based almost entirely on the relatively small number of @xmath117 m@xmath60galaxies in the sample . in appendix [ ch : others ] , we perform the same analysis for a more general galaxy sample , drawn from the nyu vagc , which provides a much better sampling of the true galaxy mass function . using the weighting scheme described above , the relative weights of galaxies with @xmath118m@xmath60@xmath119 differ by a factor of only 10 . for this galaxy sample , we find @xmath120 without weighting , compared to @xmath121 with weighting .",
    "-1    while the data are consistent with a linear relation between @xmath0 and @xmath9 , they thus prefer a slightly shallower relation .",
    "for the sample , we find @xmath122 , and @xmath123 .",
    "this should be compared to the values of @xmath124 and @xmath125 for the simple dynamical mass estimate , @xmath18 .",
    "while the mass distribution of galaxies within the sample can in principle induce a large bias in the measured slope of the @xmath0@xmath9 relation , our best fit value is in fact consistent with that derived from a more general galaxy sample , in which these effects play a far smaller role .",
    "we will explore the potential role of other sample selection effects in section [ ch : selfx ] .    in * figure",

    "for each of these four parameters , the trends in @xmath11 are significantly weaker than what we have seen for @xmath6 .",
    "the net differential trend across the sample is now on the order of 0.2 dex or so , as compared to 0.5 dex for @xmath6 .",

    "modeling , however , we have no means of refining the model used to derive equation [ eq : kvn ] .",

    "in this section we discuss three general classes of biases that may affect the results we have presented in section [ ch : results2 ] : first , systematic biases in the srsic  fits that we use to derive @xmath0 and @xmath9 ( section [ ch : bias ] ; see also appendix [ ch : others ] ) ; then , the possibility of severe selection effects for the sample ( section [ ch : selfx ] ; see also appendix [ ch : others ] ) ; and finally , systematic effects associated with the estimation of stellar mass - to - light ratios ( section [ ch : starpops ] ) .",
    "we will show very good consistency between the values of @xmath0 and @xmath9 ; this is not the case for the simple estimate @xmath18 . as in the previous section",
    ", this consistency provides strong circumstantial evidence  but not proof beyond a reasonable doubt  that there are no significant biases in either measurement .",
    "we explore the possibility of serious observational biases in * figure [ fig : bias]*. in each panel of this figure , we plot @xmath11 as a function of a basic observable : namely ( left to right ) , apparent magnitude , apparent size , and redshift .",
    "the lines in each panel show the median relation for the same bins of stellar mass as are shown in figures [ fig : rawcond]b and [ fig : corrcond]b .",
    "-1        by a similar argument to the one given in section [ ch : mstarn ] , if the apparent mass dependence of the ratio @xmath11 were driven by observational effects that are strong functions of apparent brightness or size , then we would expect there to be clear trends in @xmath11 for each of the stellar mass bins in figure [ fig : bias ] .",
    "this is not obviously the case .",
    "fitting to the data in each stellar mass bin , the gradients of the best - fit relation between @xmath11 and all of apparent magnitude , apparent size , and redshift are consistent with zero ; this is true for each stellar mass bin individually ( typically within @xmath130 ) , as well as for the sample as a whole ( within 1.2@xmath131 ) .",
    "-1    we note that the same is not true using , for example , the srsicstructural parameters given in the nyu vagc to derive @xmath0 and @xmath9 ( as we do in appendix [ ch : others ] ) . in this case , we do see a weakly statistically significant gradient ( at the level of @xmath132 ) with observed size .",
    "that is , this kind of test is indeed able to ( weakly ) detect mild systematic errors in the srsic - fit parameters on the order of 1020 % .",
    "the results in figure [ fig : bias ] thus argue against the idea that there are any serious biases affecting the measurement of @xmath0 or @xmath9 ( or , more accurately , the ratio @xmath11 ) associated with the srsic - fit structural parameters used to derive these values.-1    as can be seen in figure [ fig : corrsides ] , there is a statistically significant correlation between @xmath11 and velocity dispersion , @xmath126 . using the same argument as above ,",
    "it is conceivable that this could be produced by a systematic bias in the measured values of @xmath126 .",
    "the observed trend of @xmath133 dex in @xmath11 over @xmath134 dex in @xmath126 could be entirely explained by a @xmath135 dex differential bias in the measured values of @xmath126 . in connection with this point , we stress that a comparison between the sdss measured values of @xmath126 and those of @xcite shows no systematic biases .",
    "this should give some confidence that the trend in @xmath11 with @xmath126 is real , and not a product of observational biases .          as we have described in section [ ch : sample ] , the sample has been constructed in such a way that massive galaxies in general , and in particular central galaxies in very massive halos , are drastically overrepresented in comparison to the general field population . if there are systematic differences in @xmath11 as a function of , for example , environment or star formation activity , there is thus a very real danger that sample selection effects may play an important role in shaping our results .",
    "we explore this issue in * figure [ fig : subsamples ] * , in which we have divided the sample in central / satellite and non-/emission subsamples , in order to look for differences between these populations . here , we have selected ` non - emission ' galaxies as h@xmath12 and h@xmath136 in absorption .",

    "-1    however , we do find very slightly different @xmath0@xmath9 relations for the emission and non - emission subsamples .",
    "formally , the two relations are slightly offset from one another , at the level of 0.05 dex ; the gradients of the two relations differ at the @xmath137 level .",
    "that said , for the @xmath138 range spanned by the sample , the difference between the best - fit relations for each subsample and that for the sample as a whole are @xmath139 dex .",
    "we also note that the apparent offset disappears ( at least within @xmath137 ) if we consider only the @xmath140 galaxies in both subsamples .",
    "moreover , we do not find any differences in @xmath11 at fixed @xmath0 and @xmath7 between these different subsamples  within statistical uncertainties , each subsample shows the same behavior as is seen in figure [ fig : corrcond ] .",
    "this suggests that the apparent offset between for the emission and non - emission galaxies is driven by the different distributions of srsic  indices within the emission and non - emission subsamples , rather than any difference in @xmath0/@xmath9 intrinsically related to galaxy activity .",

    "-1    that is , our results do not appear to be strongly influenced by the relative numbers of central / satellite galaxies or of non-/emission galaxies in our sample .",
    "the above analysis does suggest , however , that the measured relation between @xmath0 and @xmath9 is sensitive to the joint @xmath0@xmath7 distribution within the sample .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the fact that @xmath11 depends on both mass and srsic  index ( figure [ fig : corrcond ] ) .",
    "we have considered biases associated with the mass distribution in section [ ch : corrd ] . but note that if , at fixed mass , the distribution of @xmath7 within the sample differs significantly from the ` true ' distribution for a general field population , then we may therefore find a very different slope for the @xmath11 relation .",
    "-1    for this reason , in appendix [ ch : others ] , we repeat our @xmath0@xmath9 comparisons for a more general sample of @xmath141 field galaxies , using the structural parameters given in the nyu vagc .",

    "further , we find very similar @xmath0@xmath9 relations for the sample using either vagc or the values for the structural parameters .",
    "any large differences in the measured @xmath0-@xmath9 relation between the sample and the general field sample would therefore necessarily be a product of selection effects .",
    "] the best fit logarithmic slope of the @xmath0@xmath9 relation for @xmath141 field galaxies is @xmath142 , compared to @xmath143 for the sample .",

    "( here again , it is significant that have found that , at fixed mass , there are no structural differences between satellite and central galaxies . )    to summarize the results of this section , then , separate analysis of central/ satellite and non-/emission galaxies suggest that our results are not strongly affected by selection effects associated with these properties .",
    "furthermore , although the observed slope of the @xmath11 relation is in principle sensitive to the joint @xmath0@xmath7 distribution within the sample , we find very little difference between the sample and a more general field galaxy sample .",
    "finally , we stress that we do not find any evidence that selection effects have an important impact on the results shown in figure [ fig : corrcond ] ; _ ie .",
    "_ , the observation that the ratio @xmath11 depends on both @xmath7 ( at fixed @xmath0 ) and on @xmath0 ( at fixed @xmath7 ) .",
    "as we have stated in the introduction , our primary motivation for comparing stellar and dynamical mass estimates is to validate the stellar mass estimates .",

    "the upper panels plot @xmath11 as a function of a direct observable ; the lower panels plot @xmath11 as a function of a derived property .",
    "note that the stellar mass estimates we have used were derived from the @xmath55 photometry , rather than spectra .",
    "the measured values of @xmath11 are thus formally independent of the three spectral measurements shown in the top panels .",
    "further , note that the age estimate that we show is taken from @xcite ; these values are also derived from the spectra .",
    "the dust obscuration and specific star formation rates ( ssfrs ) shown come from the sed fits used to derive @xmath34 ; these values are thus self - consistently derived .",
    "we have color - coded the data in figure [ fig : starpops ] according to their spectral classification as given by @xcite ; _ viz . _ : star forming ( blue ) ; low s : n star forming ( cyan ) ; composite ( yellow ) , agn ( orange ) , and non - emission ( red ) . in general , we see little if any differences in the values of @xmath11 for different stellar populations .",
    "there are not obviously large differences between the mean values of @xmath11 for agn hosts , star forming galaxies , or non - emission galaxies .    within each panel",
    "we give the gradient of the best - fit line for the whole sample .",
    "these values are all statistically consistent with zero .",
    "the only possible exceptions to this rule are the gradients in @xmath11 as a function of h@xmath12 equivalent width ( ew ) and as a function of @xmath144 , both of which are non - zero at the @xmath145 level . just as there is little if any trend for the sample as a whole , there are no statistically significant trends for any of the individual mass bins .",
    "we can quantify the degree of correspondence between stellar and dynamical mass estimates by considering the differential bias between galaxies over the range of each of the properties shown in figure [ fig : starpops ] .",
    "looking at the median relations shown for each mass bin suggests that the magnitude of such differential biases are at most 0.2 dex .",
    "we can obtain similar estimates for the sample as a whole using the fit parameters given in each panel of figure [ fig : starpops ] . taking the @xmath146 statistical limits on the slopes of these relations , we find that the differential effects across the full range of the sample are @xmath57 dex for @xmath147 , h@xmath148 ew , and restframe color ; and @xmath149 dex for h@xmath12 ew , age , dust extinction , ssfr , and @xmath34 .",
    "the same is not true using the simple estimate of dynamical mass , @xmath18 , in place of @xmath9 . as might be expected from comparing figures [ fig : raw ] and [ fig : corrd ] , we find that the @xmath6 relations for different mass bins are largely parallel , but significantly offset from one another .",
    "then , because of correlations between mass and activity , we also find significant gradients in the @xmath6 relations for the sample as a whole ; typically at the 10@xmath150 level .",
    "the size of differential biases as a function of all of @xmath147 , h@xmath148 ew , h@xmath12 ew , age , and ssfr are on the order 0.20.4 dex .",
    "we note in particular that the relatively strong gradient in @xmath151 with h@xmath12 ew noticed by @xcite disappears when we use the structure corrected dynamical mass estimator , @xmath9 , in place of the simple estimate @xmath18 ; this apparent bias seems to be more closely linked to structure than to h@xmath12 emission _ per se_. _ we thus find a very good correspondence between @xmath0 and @xmath9 for galaxies in the sample , but only provided we account for structural and dynamical non - homology .",
    "_ -1      @xcite have shown that @xmath34 and color are strongly correlated in both the optical and the nir .",
    "this implies that a single color is enough to make a reasonable estimate of @xmath34 ( see also , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "further , we have repeated our analysis using the @xmath34s derived from the sdss spectra by @xcite , and find similarly good agreement between @xmath0 and @xmath9 : at least on average , it would appear that color - derived @xmath34s are just as good as those derived from optical spectroscopy ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fig : starpops ] , we find no statistically significant trend in @xmath11 with @xmath66 color .",

    "in retrospect , it is perhaps unsurprising that @xmath18 is not a good estimate of dynamical mass . by using a srsic - fit size and total magnitude measurements we have allowed for structural non - homology in our definition of @xmath18 , while at the same time , by using @xmath72 for all galaxies , we have assumed dynamical homology . in this sense ,",

    "for the case of anisotropy , the effects on the value of @xmath23 are on the order of @xmath168 dex , and become less important for larger @xmath7 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "further , @xcite argue that the galaxy dynamics ( or , more accurately , the value of @xmath94 ) close to the galaxy center are in principle rather sensitive to the precise shape of the total mass distribution .",

    "the main difference between this prescription and the one given in equation [ eq : kvn ] is that it is phrased in terms of the observed velocity dispersion within the effective radius , @xmath169 , rather than the central velocity dispersion @xmath3 .",
    "this prescription thus has a different dependence on dynamical isotropy and the dark matter profile , and so provides an indirect means of probing the importance of these effects . using the @xcite prescription , we find qualitatively and quantitatively similar results : we find that @xmath170 ; we still see that @xmath11 depends on @xmath0 at fixed @xmath7 , and on @xmath7 at fixed @xmath0 ( although this dependence is somewhat shallower ) ; we see no trends in @xmath11 with apparent magnitude or redshift , but a weak trend with observed size ; and , at fixed mass , we see no statistically significant trends in @xmath34 with stellar population parameters .",
    "-1    that is , while it is virtually certain that the model used to derive the prescription for @xmath23 given in equation [ eq : kvn ] is wrong in several important respects , it seems unlikely that accounting for those effects that are ignored in the model would have a drastic effect on our results and conclusions .",
    "as we have repeatedly stressed , detailed dynamical modeling is necessary better constrain the ` true ' values of @xmath94 for individual galaxies .        in comparison",
    "to other studies of the relation between stellar and dynamical mass estimates based on sdss data , we find considerably less variation in @xmath11 with mass . in the case of @xcite ,",
    "this difference is simply due to the fact that we account for non - homology in the derivation of @xmath9 ; using the simple mass estimate @xmath18 , we have verified that we are able to reproduce their results . in the case of @xcite , there is the additional complication that they use qualitatively different measures of total flux and size : specifically , the petrosian magnitudes and half - light radii given in the basic sdss catalog , which are derived directly from the observed curves of growth .",
    "again , we have verified that we can reproduce their results using the same measurements .",
    "-1    @xcite also split their galaxy sample into bins of srsic  index , and find similar slopes to the @xmath0@xmath18 relation for each subsample ; they find that the logarithmic slope of the relation varies from 0.847 to 0.801 between @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",
    "the size of this variation is entirely consistent with the results we have shown in figure [ fig : rawcond ] .",
    "they use this fact to argue that non - homology does not have a significant impact on the slope of the global @xmath0@xmath9 relation .",
    "however , as we have also shown in figure [ fig : rawcond ] , while the @xmath0@xmath18 relations for each bin in @xmath7 are parallel , they are significantly offset from one another .",
    "it is this through this offset , combined with a correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath7 , that non - homology affects the slope of the @xmath0@xmath9 relation ; @xcite make no mention of such an offset . while our conclusions differ with those of @xcite , our results are thus not obviously inconsistent .",
    "-1      @xcite have also argued against the idea that non - homology has an important impact on dynamical mass estimates .",
    "this argument was based on dynamical mass - to - light ratios derived from detailed 2d and 3d modeling 25 structurally early type galaxies from the sauron sample .",
    "@xcite compared the dynamical mass - to - light ratios , so derived , to the simple virial mass estimator @xmath173 , where @xmath174 and @xmath175 were derived from de vaucouleurs profile fits .",
    "they found no evidence for an @xmath7-dependent offset between these two quantities .",
    "the fact that @xcite use de vaucouleurs - fit sizes and magnitudes is significant : as we have argued above and in appendix [ ch : others ] , when using de vaucouleurs fits to derive size and magnitude measurements , it is appropriate to use a constant @xmath21 in the definition of @xmath18 .",
    "that is , by using de vaucouleurs - fit sizes and masses to define @xmath176 , @xcite effectively guaranteed , almost by construction , that they would find no structure - dependence when comparing the ` simple ' dynamical mass - to - light ratio to that derived from full dynamical modeling .",
    "as we have mentioned in the introduction , the fundamental plane can be thought of as measuring the variation in the dynamical mass - to - light ratios of early type galaxies as a function of velocity dispersion , luminosity , or mass ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "how do our derived values of @xmath9 compare to those derived from the fundamental plane ? to address this question , we selected the non - emission galaxies from within the sample with @xmath177 .",
    "for these galaxies , we find @xmath178 . for comparison ,",
    "@xcite find @xmath179 , where again , @xmath174 and @xmath175 have been derived via de vaucouleurs fits .",
    "again , the covariance between the fit values of @xmath165 , @xmath40 , and @xmath7 mean that @xmath180 .",
    "our structure - corrected dynamical mass estimates are thus in good agreement with those derived from the fundamental plane .",
    "( parenthetically , we also note that @xcite found that their dynamical mass - to - light ratios derived from detailed dynamical fits scaled as @xmath181 , which is also consistent with our results . )",
    "we have also considered how the dynamical - to - stellar mass ratio , @xmath182 varies with @xmath126 for this same sample of early type galaxies : we find @xmath183 .",
    "this would suggest that less than half of the tilt of the fundamental plane is due to variations in the mass - to - light ratios of early type galaxies as a function of @xmath126 ( _ cf .",
    "_ , e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we present this result only for completeness ; proper interpretation of this result requires much more detailed analysis , and is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "we also note that both @xcite and @xcite have made a very similar argument for the importance of non - homology in estimating dynamical masses as we have made in sections [ ch : results ] and [ ch : results2 ] , based on dynamical mass - to - light ratios derived from the fundamental plane .",
    "our analysis based on the correspondence between @xmath0 and @xmath9 is complementary to theirs in two ways .",
    "first , their analyses were specific to early type galaxies ; we have thus extended their result to the general galaxy population . secondly , both authors focussed on @xmath33 , rather than @xmath11 ; that is , neither of these authors considered the relation between galaxies stellar and dynamical masses .",
    "turning now to the interpretation of our results , the remarkable consistency between stellar and dynamical mass estimates shows two things .",
    "first , it strongly suggests that the measurements of @xmath0 and @xmath9 are both meaningful and relatively robust .",
    "in particular , our results indicate that it is possible to derive stellar mass estimates without strong differential biases as a function of age , dust , ssfr , or @xmath34 , based only on broadband optical photometry ( or indeed on a single optical color ) .",
    "secondly , it implies that intrinsic variations in the stellar - to - dynamical mass ratio ( due to , e.g. , variations in the dark  to  stellar mass ratio , variations in the imf , or dynamical differences beyond the simple non - homology considered here ) as a function of stellar mass , galaxy structure , and star formation rate / history are either small , or conspire to leave the inferred values of @xmath11 relatively unchanged . the rest of this section will be devoted to discussion of this result .",
    "since @xmath9 is an estimate of total mass , it can only be interpreted as an upper bound on the true stellar mass .",
    "because we have no _ a priori _ means of separating out the relative contributions of luminous and non - luminous mass to @xmath9 , the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath9 is complicated by degeneracies between the relative contributions of gas and dark matter , as well as uncertainties in the low mass shape of the imf .    the simplest way to interpret",
    "the non - linearity of the @xmath0@xmath9 relation is as indicating a greater central dark matter fraction for higher mass galaxies , in qualitative agreement with theoretical expectations . using simple arguments based on the observed dynamics of elliptical galaxies ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite have argued that accounting for a dark matter halo implies @xmath1840.18 dex .",
    "this would go a long way towards explaining the @xmath185 offset that we have observed .",
    "-1    we can estimate gas masses using the prescription given by @xcite .",
    "these authors have used a sample of relatively low mass sdss galaxies with literature hi masses to derive a prescription for @xmath186 as a function of @xmath187 color and stellar surface density . using this prescription to derive baryonic mass estimates , @xmath188 ,",
    "reduces the size of the offset between @xmath28 and @xmath9 by 0.05 dex to @xmath189 dex , and brings the logarithmic slope of the @xmath190 relation to 0.95 .",
    "the fact that the @xcite relation has been derived for very different galaxies to the ones we consider here means that this result should be interpreted with caution .",
    "even so , it is striking that , taken together , the estimated contributions of hi and dark matter almost perfectly explain the observed offset between @xmath0 and @xmath9 , and imply only a mild trend in @xmath190 with mass : @xmath191 .",
    "then there is the matter of the imf .",
    "the effect of adopting a @xcite imf rather than that of @xcite would be approximately to scale all our values of @xmath0 up by 0.22 dex . for a linear @xmath0@xmath9 relation ( which our data are only marginally consistent with ) , this would leave virtually no room for dark matter or gas in the centers of galaxies in our sample . for the slightly less - than - linear relation preferred by our data , this would imply that @xmath192 for galaxies with @xmath117 m@xmath60 , which is logically inconsistent .",
    "thus we can say that , at best , our results are only marginally consistent with a @xcite imf .",
    "accounting for dark matter , our results are also weakly inconsistent with a ` diet salpeter ' imf , and completely consistent with a @xcite or @xcite imf .",
    "( parenthetically , we also note that the results shown in figure [ fig : starpops ] can also provide a weak constraint on variations in the imf as a function of star formation rate / history . )",
    "-1    finally , we note that the observed scatter around the @xmath0@xmath9 relation is rather small : just 0.13 dex .",
    "we argue in appendix [ ch : others ] that the ratio @xmath193 is remarkably insensitive to errors in the srsic - fit parameters , provided that they are consistently derived , and that dynamical non - homology is taken into account .",
    "this implies that the uncertainties in @xmath11 are dominated by errors in the measurement of @xmath3 and @xmath34 .",
    "the mean formal uncertainty in @xmath126 for our galaxy sample is 0.034 dex .",
    "we estimate the mean random error in @xmath34 to be on the order of 0.1 dex ; this is the random scatter between the sed - fit @xmath34s used here and the spectrally derived @xmath34s given by @xcite .. including nir data ( where the stellar population models are the most uncertain ) , and properly accounting for propagation of uncertainties in stellar population models and the imf , @xcite argue that the uncertainties in @xmath34 are on the order of 0.3 dex . ] adding these errors in quadrature ( _ ie . _  neglecting correlations between @xmath126 and @xmath34 at fixed @xmath0 )",
    "produces an uncertainty in @xmath11 of 0.12 dex .",
    "this would imply that , at fixed @xmath0 , the intrinsic scatter in @xmath11 is potentially very small indeed : @xmath194 dex . -1",
    "the central focus of this work has been the degree of consistency between stellar and dynamical mass estimates , based on the latest generation of data products from the sdss .",
    "we have shown that structural differences in galaxy dynamics can have a large impact on the estimated values of dynamical mass , and so on the degree of correspondence between stellar and dynamical mass ( section [ ch : results ] ; figures [ fig : raw ] and [ fig : corrd ] ) . provided",
    "we account for structure - dependent differences in galaxy dynamics ( using the term @xmath23 , as defined in equations [ eq : mdyn ] and [ eq : kvn ] ) , we find very good agreement between the inferred stellar and dynamical masses of galaxies within the sample . -1    our analysis",
    "is based on the carefully - constructed satellite / central galaxy sample of , making selection effects a major potential concern . however , we find no signs of major differences in the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath9 for central / satellite or non-/emission galaxies within the sample , suggesting that our results are not seriously affected by selection effects ( section [ ch : selfx ] ; figure [ fig : subsamples ] ) .",
    "moreover , we find qualitatively and quantitatively similar results analyzing a more general sample of @xmath141 galaxies , using the best - fit srsic  parameters given in the nyu vagc , or using the de vaucouleurs / exponential ` model `  fit parameters given in the basic sdss catalog ( appendix [ ch : others ] ) .",
    "-1    we find that the ratio @xmath11 varies with both @xmath0 and @xmath7 ( sections [ ch : structure ] and [ ch : mstarn ] ; figures [ fig : rawcond ] and [ fig : corrcond ] ) . while the apparent @xmath7-dependence of @xmath11 is sensitive to the assumed form of @xmath23 , changing @xmath23 can not affect the result that @xmath11 varies with @xmath0 at fixed @xmath7 . without spatially resolved dynamical information for individual galaxies , however , we can not determine whether the apparent mass - dependence of @xmath11 is caused by some mass - dependent difference in galaxy dynamics , rather than a genuine physical difference in the stellar - to - dynamical mass ratios of galaxies with different masses .",
    "-1    similarly , while we have shown very good agreement between stellar and dynamical masses for sdss galaxies , we can not unambiguously prove that neither of these quantities suffers from systematic biases .",
    "on the other hand , using the srsic - fit parameters given by , we do not see any systematic variation in @xmath11 with observed properties like apparent magnitude , apparent size , or redshift ( section [ ch : bias ] ; figure [ fig : bias ] ) .",
    "this is not true if we use the srsic - fit parameters given in the nyu vagc , which has been shown to suffer from systematic errors arising due to background over - subtraction .",
    "that is , we have the ability to detect these sorts of errors , and do not see evidence for such errors for our sample .",
    "further , we do not see any signs of variation in @xmath11 for galaxies with different stellar populations , or for galaxies in different states of activity ( _ ie .",
    "_ , agn hosts , star forming galaxies , or non - emission galaxies ) .    these results , together with the good general agreement between @xmath0 and @xmath9 provide strong circumstantial evidence ( but not proof beyond a reasonable doubt ) that there are no serious systematic biases in the values of @xmath0 and @xmath9 that we use here .",
    "this implies that the assumption of non - homology gives the wrong dynamical mass .",
    "further , this suggests that there are not strong biases in the @xmath34s we have used here : at 99 % confidence , the consistency between @xmath0 and @xmath9 implies any differential biases in the estimate of @xmath34 across a wide range of stellar populations are at the level of @xmath13 dex ( @xmath14 % ) . -1",

    "for dr6 + , partially in response to the findings of @xcite , the sdss velocity dispersion pipelines were substantially revised .",
    "the new dispersions have been shown to agree well with the edr velocity dispersions used by @xcite , and thus , by implication , with the improved estimates for dr5 derived by @xcite .    in this appendix , in order to validate the dr7 velocity dispersions , we present a comparison between the velocity dispersions given in the basic sdss dr7 catalog to those given by @xcite for elliptical galaxies in their sample .",

    "it is clear from this figure that neither of the dr7 velocity dispersions suffers from serious systematic biases in comparison to the @xcite measurements .",
    "we note , however , that the rms scatter , which is on the order of 19 km / s , is considerably higher than the median formal measurement uncertainty given in the sdss catalog , which is on the order of 3.5 km / s for the galaxies shown in figure [ fig : faber ] .",
    "that is , it seems that the formal uncertainties on the sdss velocity dispersions significantly underestimates the true error , at least for the relatively bright galaxies shown here .",

    ", we also require that the relative error on the velocity dispersion is less than 10 % , and that @xmath197 km / s ; these selections effectively limit the sample to @xmath198 m@xmath60 .",
    "the additional incompleteness due to our velocity dispersion criteria is less than 10 % for all @xmath199 m@xmath60  and @xmath200 , but is significant for @xmath201 at all masses .",
    "there is one complicating factor in the comparison between this general field sample and the sample that we discuss in the main text . for the field sample ,",
    "we are forced to rely on either the de vaucouleurs / exponential ` model `  fits provided in the basic sdss catalog , or the srsic  fits given in the nyu vagc .",

    "both of these sets of measurements have their faults .",
    "the sdss ` model `  fits are overly simplistic in that they assume that @xmath7 is equal to either 1 or 4 ; this will clearly introduce systematic errors in the fit quantities as a function of ( intrinsic ) profile shape .",
    "the vagc srsic  fits are also known to suffer systematic errors @xcite , due to background over - subtraction .",

    "the results for this general sample agree really very well with what we have found for the sample in figure [ fig : corrd ] .",
    "moreover , the two panels in figure [ fig : others ] agree remarkably well with one another , even despite the significant and very different systematic errors that each set of measurements suffers from",
    ".    how can this be ?",
    "it turns out that the covariance between srsicparameters leaves ratio @xmath11 is remarkably robust to both random and systematic errors in the srsic  fits , provided @xmath9 is calculated as per equation [ eq : mdyn ] . to illustrate this ,",
    "let us compare the and vagc measurements .",
    "although there are large differences in all three parameters individually , there are tight correlations between @xmath202 , @xmath203 , and @xmath204 .",
    "( here and in what follows the ` @xmath205 ' implies the difference between the vagc and @xcite - derived value , in the sense of vagc - minus- . )",

    "@xmath9 , at least as defined in equation [ eq : mdyn ] , depends on both the effective radius and srsic  index .",
    "considering the change in @xmath9 due to changes in size alone , we find @xmath207 , with a scatter of 0.07 dex ; for the effect due to changes in the srsicindex alone , we find @xmath208 , with an rms scatter of 0.03 dex . taken together , the overall change in @xmath9 scales with @xmath202 as @xmath209 .",
    "thus we see that the changes in @xmath0 and @xmath9 thus have virtually the same dependence on @xmath202 , leaving the ratio @xmath11 virtually unchanged .",
    "further , the scatter in @xmath210 is just 0.04 dex . using the basic sdss ` model `  fits ,",
    "while we find slightly stronger dependences with @xmath202 , we still find that the ratio @xmath11 remains very robust .",
    "we stress that the above argument only holds if we account for the dynamical effects of structure in the calculation of @xmath9 : if we removed the @xmath7-dependence of @xmath9 that enters via @xmath23 , then we would find that the ratio @xmath211 , in agreement with the expectation from the analysis immediately above .",
    "-1    to explicitly demonstrate that the observed relation between @xmath0 and @xmath9 is not particularly sensitive to the measurements used to derive the values of @xmath0 and @xmath9 , in * figure [ fig : measures ] * we show the @xmath0@xmath9 relation for the sample analyzed using structural parameters from the nyu vagc ( left panel ) or from the sdss catalog ( right panel ) . in comparison to figure [ fig : corrd ] , the slope of the @xmath0@xmath9 relation for the sample is very similar using any of the three sets of structural parameters : 0.92 for the fits , compared to 0.89 for the nyu vagc fits , and 0.88 for the sdss ` model `  fits .",
    "the normalization of the @xmath0@xmath9 relation is slightly more sensitive : at @xmath212 m@xmath60 , we find that @xmath213 = @xmath214 , @xmath215 , and @xmath216 dex using the , vagc , and sdss fits , respectively .    in comparison to figure [ fig : others ] , the results in figure [ fig : measures ] also demonstrate that the @xmath0@xmath9 relation for the is very similar to that for a more general field galaxy sample .",
    "for example , using structural parameters from the vagc , the logarithmic slope and intercept of the @xmath0@xmath9 relation are @xmath217 and @xmath218 for the sample , compared to @xmath219 and @xmath220 for the general galaxy sample .            in * figure [ fig : othersubs ] * , we show that galaxies in different states of activity follow very similar @xmath0@xmath9 relations . in this figure , we have split the general galaxy sample into non - emission , star forming , and agn and composite spectra subsamples using the @xcite spectral classification scheme described in section [ ch : selfx ] ) .",
    "the logarithmic slopes of the @xmath0@xmath9 relation for each subsample agree with one another , as well as with that for the sample as a whole , to within a few percent .",
    "we do find that the @xmath0@xmath9 relation for the star forming subsample is offset from that for the non - emission and agn / composite subsamples , at the level of 0.07 dex .",
    "however , as for the sample ( see section [ ch : selfx ] ) , these small differences disappear if we consider only @xmath177 galaxies .",
    "we thus conclude that these differences are principally driven by the different distribution of @xmath7 values within the star forming sample , rather than intrinsic differences in the stellar - to - dynamical mass ratios of star forming galaxies .",
    "finally , in * figure [ fig : othercond ] * , we separate out the @xmath0- and @xmath7-dependences of @xmath11 for the general galaxy sample , analyzed using the nyu vagc srsic - fit parameters .",
    "again , we find that the ratio @xmath11 depends on both @xmath0 ( at fixed @xmath7 ) and on @xmath7 ( at fixed @xmath0 ) .",

    "as we have noted above , there are significant differences in the values of @xmath0 and @xmath7 given by and in the vagc .",
    "these differences in @xmath0 and @xmath7 mean that the results in this figure are not in quantitative agreement with those shown in figure [ fig : othercond ] , even though both datasets show good agreement in the global @xmath0@xmath9 relation .",
    "in particular , the slope of the @xmath11@xmath7 relation at fixed @xmath0 is significantly steeper than we find for the sample .",
    "this is at least partially due to the bias in the nyu values of @xmath7 ; the nyu values are systematically lower than the values , which has the effect of steepening the @xmath11@xmath7 relation .    with these caveats ,",
    "the main conclusion to be drawn from figure [ fig : othercond ] is that accounting for non - homology in the derivation of dynamical masses leads to considerably better consistency between @xmath0 and @xmath9 ( as a function of @xmath7 , and at fixed @xmath0 ) , in agreement with our findings in section [ ch : results2 ] .",
    "further , we note that we find similar and consistent behavior in @xmath11 at fixed @xmath0 and @xmath7 for each of the three subsamples shown in figure [ fig : othersubs ] , in agreement with our conclusions above .    in summary , then , in this appendix we have demonstrated two things .",
