    "the phase transitions of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , for example the phase transition of the chiral symmetry restoration and the deconfinement phase transition , have attracted lots of attentions in recent years .",
    "it is expected that these phase transitions occur and the deconfined quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) is formed in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions  @xcite ( for example the current experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) ) and in the interior of neutron stars  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , studying the qcd phase transitions is also an elementary problem in strong interaction physics .",
    "recently , the star collaboration at rhic report their measurements of azimuthal charged - particle correlations near center - of - mass rapidity in au + au and cu + cu collisions at @xmath0 . they find a significant signal consistent with the charge separation of quarks along the system s orbital angular momentum axis  @xcite .",
    "the observed charge separation indicates that parity - odd domains , where the parity ( @xmath1 ) symmetry is locally violated , might be created during the relativistic heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "qcd is an su(3 ) yang - mills gauge theory coupled with quarks .",
    "the gauge field can have nontrivial configurations which can be characterized by a topological invariant , the winding number @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the winding number is an integer and reads @xmath3 . here",
    "@xmath4 is the qcd coupling constant .",
    "the gluon field tensor and its dual are @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the nontrivial gauge field configurations with non - zero winding number @xmath2 can result in non - conservation of the axial currents due to the axial anomaly  @xcite , i.e. , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a quark field , @xmath9 is the current mass of the quark , and @xmath10 is the number of quark flavors .",
    "@xmath11 denotes the axial current density in the background of a gauge field configuration @xmath12 . integrating the two sides of eq .   over three dimension space and one dimension time and assuming the number of right - handed and left - handed fermions is equal initially at @xmath13",
    ", we obtain @xmath14 from eq .",
    "one can clearly find that through the interactions between quarks and nontrivial gluon configuration with non - zero @xmath2 , the right - handed quarks are converted into left - handed quarks , vice versa depending on the sign of the winding number .",
    "then there will be an asymmetry between the number of right- and left - handed quarks .",
    "when a magnetic field is added , an electric current is induced along the magnetic field and positive charges are separated from negative charge , which is called the `` chiral magnetic effect ''  @xcite .",
    "now that the chiral magnetic effect can be observed through the measurements of azimuthal charged - particle correlations in the relativistic heavy - ion collisions , a natural question arises , i.e. whether can we detect the properties of the qcd phase transitions , especially the chiral phase transition through the observations of the chiral magnetic effect ? to answer this question , we have to study how the chiral magnetic effect or the charge separation effect is influenced by the chiral phase transition .",

    "v we present our summary and conclusions .",
    "in this work , we will study the chiral magnetic effect and the qcd phase transitions in the 2 + 1 flavor polyakov  nambu  jona - lasinio model .",
    "the validity of the pnjl model has been confirmed in a series of works by confronting the pnjl results with the lattice qcd data  @xcite .",
    "the pnjl model not only has the chiral symmetry and the dynamical breaking mechanism of this symmetry , which are same as the conventional nambu  jona - lasinio model , but also include the effect of color confinement through the polyakov loop .",

    "the effect of the mass of the electric current carrier , i.e. , the fermion , is to decrease @xmath76 , since the velocity of the fermion becomes smaller when the mass of the fermion is increased with a fixed energy . on the contrary , the chiral electric current density increases with the temperature and the chemical potential .    , @xmath93 quarks and @xmath94 quarks , the polyakov - loop @xmath33 and its conjugate @xmath34 as functions of the temperature with @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) and @xmath91 ( @xmath97 ) in the pnjl model with parameters given in the sec.[sec2 ] . ]    next , we turn our attentions to the chiral electric current produced in the three - flavor quark system under an external magnetic field , whose expression is given in eq .  .",
    "from our above experience that the chiral electric current density would be affected by the particle mass and temperature , we first investigate the dependence of the constituent masses of three - flavor quarks on the temperature during the qcd phase transitions in the pnjl model . minimizing the thermodynamical potential in eq .",
    "with respect to three - flavor quark condensates , the polyakov - loop @xmath33 and its conjugate @xmath34 , we obtain a set of equations of motion .",
    "we neglect the influence of the magnetic field on these equations of motion in our numerical calculations , since the magnetic field ( @xmath98 in the non - central heavy - ion collisions  @xcite ) has little impact on these equations of motion .",

    "here we take the chiral chemical potential @xmath91 for example . in the figure we can find that the constituent masses of @xmath99 , @xmath93 quarks and @xmath94 quarks decrease with the increase of the temperature , and a first order chiral phase transition takes place at the critical temperature @xmath100 .",
    "the chiral symmetry is restored above this critical temperature and the constituent masses of @xmath99 , @xmath93 quarks decrease to their small current masses .",
    "since the @xmath94 quark has relatively larger current quark mass , its constituent mass is still relatively large when the temperature is larger than @xmath101 , but it is also decreased quickly with the increase of the temperature . in our calculations",
    "we also note that when the chiral chemical potential @xmath54 is decreased , the value of the critical temperature @xmath101 becomes larger and the first order chiral phase transition gradually evolves to a continuous crossover .",

    "[ f3 ] , i.e. the horizontal lines from bottom to top corresponding to @xmath103 150 , 200 , and 250 mevs , respectively .",
    "one can clearly find that when the temperature is high , the system is in the chiral symmetric and deconfined phase , and the chiral electric current density approaches its limit value , i.e. eq .  .",
    "when the temperature is lowered , especially when the temperature is below the critical temperature @xmath101 , the chiral symmetry is broken and quarks get large constituent masses , then the chiral electric current density along the direction of the external magnetic field is quite suppressed and quickly approaches zero with the decrease of the temperature . this behavior is independent of the value of the chiral chemical potential as fig .",
    "[ f3 ] clearly shows . in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] we just take magnetic field strength @xmath89 for example , and the chiral electric current density is linearly proportional to the magnetic field strength , since the magnetic field strength @xmath59 does not enter into the integrations in the expression of @xmath76 , i.e. , eq .  .",
    "therefore , when the magnetic field strength takes other values , we still have the fact that when the temperature is below the chiral critical temperature @xmath101 , large constituent masses of quarks suppress the chiral electric current drastically .",

    "therefore , the total positive ( negative ) electric charges of the charged particles produced in heavy ion collisions increase with those of the quarks and anti - quarks .",
    "so far , we can calculate the azimuthal charged particle correlations @xmath148 in heavy ion collisions . with the notation @xmath149",
    ", it can be shown that  @xcite @xmath150 and @xmath151 where the azimuthal angle distribution of the charged particles is assumed to be @xmath152 since we mainly focus on the influence of the qcd phase transitions , especially the chiral phase transition , on the chiral magnetic effect in this work , we will neglect the screening suppression effect due to the final state interactions  @xcite and make @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) , then we have @xmath153 .",
    "therefore , we only study @xmath154 in the following .     as function of the temperature calculated in the pnjl model with @xmath155 ( left panel ) and @xmath91 ( right panel ) .",
    "the magnetic field corresponds to @xmath156 , @xmath157 , and @xmath158 from top to bottom , respectively . ]    in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] we show @xmath154 defined in eq .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) as function of the temperature at several values of the chiral chemical potential @xmath54 ( @xmath97 ) and the magnetic field strength .",
    "we find that there is a pronounced cusp in @xmath154 at the critical temperature during the chiral phase transition ( the critical temperature @xmath159 for @xmath155 and @xmath160 for @xmath91 in the pnjl model ) . from the fig .",
    "[ f7 ] one can also find that although the value of @xmath154 is proportional to the square of the magnetic field strength , the shape of the curve for @xmath154 as function of temperature is almost independent of the magnetic field strength .",
    "furthermore , the cusp at the critical temperature in the curve becomes much sharper with the increase of the chiral chemical potential . with the decrease of the temperature , when the temperature is below @xmath161 , chiral symmetry is dynamically broken and quarks obtain large constituent masses .",
    "we should emphasize that it is the large quark mass that results in the drastic suppression of the chiral electric current density ( see sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] ) , the electric charge difference between on each side of the reaction plane ( see fig .  [ f6 ] ) , and the azimuthal charged particle correlations .",
    "furthermore , the chiral magnetic effect is close related with the axial anomaly  @xcite . without axial anomaly there would not be the chiral magnetic effect . since the axial anomaly can be suppressed by the mass effect , which has been discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is natural to expect that the chiral magnetic effect can also be suppressed by large constituent quark masses .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable that the azimuthal charged particle correlations described by @xmath154 ( @xmath162 and @xmath163 ) defined in eqs .",
    "( [ a1 ] )  ( [ a2 ] ) are quite decreased once the temperature is below the critical temperature .",
    "it can been seen from fig .",
    "[ f7 ] that , when the temperature is above @xmath161 , @xmath154 decreases with the increase of the temperature , which is because higher temperature makes it more difficult to polarize quarks with magnetic field and thus suppresses the charge separation effect .    what do our calculated results imply in future energy scanning experiments of heavy ion collisions ? with the decrease of the heavy ion collision energy , the temperature of the qgp produced in the fireball at early stage is also decreased .",
    "since the magnetic field produced in non - central collisions decays with time  @xcite , the observed charge separation mainly carries the information of the qgp at early stage .",
    "therefore , we expect that when the collision energy is decreased to a value that can not drive the chiral phase transition , the azimuthal charged particle correlations ( especially for the same charge correlations , because the opposite charge correlations are suppressed by final state interactions ) are quite suppressed .",
    "so this property can be employed to search for where the qcd phase transitions take place .    from the calculations of the azimuthal",
    "charged particle correlations @xmath148 above , we can find that there are some uncertainties on the total positive ( negative ) electric charges of the produced charged particles @xmath140 ( @xmath141 ) .",
    "this little defect motivate us to search for other better correlators which are not divided by the square of @xmath140 or @xmath141 .",
    "in fact , this kind of correlators has been proposed by d.e.kharzeev and his collaborators  @xcite . in the following we compare these two kinds of correlators briefly .",
    "first of all , we make @xmath164 and @xmath165 , and then the @xmath107 and @xmath108 are the azimuthal angles of produced particles with respective to the reaction plane as fig .",
    "[ f4 ] shows .",
    "for each collision event , we follow the definition of the correlators in ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. , @xmath166 in the same way , here @xmath167 denotes the electric charge . in order to remove the multiplicity",
    "fluctuations the correlators are averaged over @xmath168 similar events .",
    "then one obtain @xmath169 where the correlators @xmath170 are those calculated in fig .",
    "furthermore , correlators which are not divided by square of the total multiplicity of charged particles are also proposed by d.e.kharzeev and his collaborators and are thought to be very useful , which are @xmath171 with @xmath172 same as the @xmath170 , it can be found that @xmath173 and @xmath174 in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] we have calculated the @xmath139 as function of the temperature during the qcd phase transitions , and find that @xmath139 is rapidly suppressed and approaches zero when the temperature is below the chiral critical temperature . within similar collision events ( similar centrality and atomic number )",
    ", it can be expected that the dependence of the volume of the fireball at the early stage on the collision energy is mild .",
    "therefore , it can be predicted that with the decrease of the collision energy , the correlators @xmath175 , which are the azimuthal charged particle correlations not divided by the square of the total multiplicity of charged particles , get a sudden suppression at the critical temperature of the qcd phase transitions and approaches zero rapidly .",
    "in this work , we have studied the influence of the qcd phase transitions on the chiral magnetic effect .",
    "the chiral electric current density , the electric charge difference between on each side of the reaction plane , and the azimuthal charged particle correlations in heavy ion collisions are calculated in the pnjl model , and their dependence on the temperature are studied .",
    "we find that with the decrease of the temperature , the chiral electric current density and the electric charge difference between on each side of the reaction plane are suppressed abruptly at the critical temperature of the qcd phase transitions and approach zero rapidly , since below the critical temperature the chiral symmetry is broken and quarks obtain large constituent mass .",
    "it is the large quark mass that suppresses not only the axial anomaly but also the chiral magnetic effect . for",
    "the azimuthal charged particle correlations , we study not only the correlators @xmath170 , which are the correlators divided by the square of the total multiplicity of charged particles and are measured in current experiments , but also another kind of correlators @xmath175 which are not divided by the square of the total multiplicity .",
    "we find that both @xmath170 and @xmath175 get a sudden suppression at the critical temperature of the qcd phase transitions .",
    "furthermore , the correlators @xmath175 approaches zero rapidly once the temperature decreases to values that are below the critical temperature .",
    "therefore , it indicates that azimuthal charged particle correlations ( both @xmath170 and @xmath175 , in fact @xmath175 is better because the correlators @xmath175 remove the fluctuations of the total multiplicity of charged particles ) can be used as a signal to identify the chiral phase transition in the energy scan experiment in rhic .",
    "we should discuss the possibility that using the azimuthal charged particle correlations ( @xmath170 and @xmath175 ) to search for where the qcd phase transitions take place in future energy scanning experiments in rhic . in order to simplify the calculations",
    ", we make the magnetic field strength and the chiral chemical potential fixed across the qcd phase transitions in this work . in the realistic situations",
    "the magnetic field decays with time and the chiral chemical potential has some distribution .",
    "however , we think that our simplification is reasonable and would not change our conclusions .",
    "the reasons are listed below :    \\(1 ) in this work we are concentrated on the influence of the qcd phase transitions , especially the chiral phase transition , on the chiral magnetic effect embodied by the phenomenon of the charge separation . since the chiral phase transition takes place during a very narrow region of the temperature ( or the collision energy equivalently ) as fig .",
    "[ f2 ] shows , the dependence of the magnetic field and the chiral chemical potential on the temperature is limited in this narrow region .",
    "\\(2 ) indeed the magnetic field decays with time in a collision event , which has been confirmed in ref .",
    "however , what influences on our calculations is the dependence of the magnetic field in the fireball at early stage on the collision energy ( different events with different collision energy ) .",
    "why is the magnetic field at the early stage of the evolution of the fireball ?",
    "this is because the electric charge difference between on each side of the reaction plane @xmath176 ( describing the magnitude of the charge separation ) is proportional to the magnetic field strength as eqs .",
    "show ( we should emphasize that the total multiplicity of the charged particle @xmath177 is almost not affected by the magnetic field with value @xmath178 in the non - central heavy ion collisions ) .",
    "therefore , the electric charge difference coming from the early stage of the fireball evolution is much larger than that from the late stage , since the magnetic field at early stage is larger than that at late stage .",
    "so we are more concerned about the magnetic field at early stage .",
    "fortunately , for similar collision events ( similar centrality and atomic number ) , the dependence of the magnetic field on the collision energy is very mild ( comparing fig.a.1 .",
    "( center of mass energy per nucleon pair being @xmath179 ) with fig.a.2 ( @xmath180 ) in ref .",
    "this is because what determines the magnetic field is the velocity of the heavy ion for similar collision events .",
    "however , for @xmath180 the velocity of the heavy ion is @xmath181 where @xmath182 is the light speed ; for @xmath179 the velocity of the heavy ion is @xmath183 .",
    "therefore , although the difference of the two collision energy is quite large , the difference of their corresponding velocity of the heavy ion is quite small , which results in that the difference of the magnetic field is small .",
    "\\(3 ) as for the chiral chemical potential , we should comment that in the chiral symmetry broken phase , quarks get constituent mass .",
    "it is found that the mass always causes the asymmetry between the number of right - handed and left - handed fermions to decay  @xcite , i.e. , the chiral chemical potential decreases with time in the chiral symmetry broken phase .",
    "our calculations above indicate that when the temperature is decreased and crosses the critical temperature of the chiral phase transition , large quark constituent mass suddenly suppresses the electric charge difference between on each side of the reaction plane .",
    "these calculations are performed with the chiral chemical potential fixed . if we further consider that the chiral chemical potential is reduced when the temperature is below the critical temperature , the suppression is much more significant .",
    "\\(4 ) in this work we perform our calculations with multi - values for the magnetic field strength and the chiral chemical potential ( see fig .",
    "[ f3 ] , fig .",
    "[ f6 ] , and fig .",
    "for all these values we find the same conclusion that in the chiral symmetry broken phase , the chiral magnetic effect is quite suppressed and almost vanishes .",
    "therefore , the chiral magnetic effect can be used as an order parameter of the qcd phase transitions .",
    "\\(5 ) we should emphasize that the physical essence underlying our calculated results is very important .",
    "it is the large mass that suppresses the axial anomaly and the asymmetry between the number of right - handed and left - handed fermions , which is verified in general quantum field theory  @xcite . when the mass of the fermion approaches infinity , there would be of course no difference between right- and left - handed fermions",
    "therefore , our calculated results is consistent with this basic principle and verify the conjecture proposed by d.e.kharzeev and his collaborators that the chiral magnetic effect can be used as an order parameter for the qcd phase transition  @xcite .",
