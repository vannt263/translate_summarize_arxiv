    "a possible explanation for the ccs @xmath12 = 7@xmath13 emission toward star - forming peaks is that ccs also exists in evolved molecular gas as a secondary late - stage peak due to co depletion in the chemical evolution ( @xcite and references therein ; @xcite ) .    in the tukh003 and tukh021 regions ,",

    "we assume that the one - dimensional velocity dispersion ( 1@xmath41 ) of the protostar with respect to the core center is equal to that of the velocity dispersion of the linewidth of the emission toward the core ( fwhm/(2 @xmath42 ) ) .",
    "we take an fwhm linewidth of 0.5 km s@xmath17 as a representative number ( the fwhm linewidth of n@xmath0h@xmath1 @xmath8 = 1@xmath50 for all the cores except tukh021 is 0.63@xmath160.23 km s@xmath17 as seen from table 4 ; to be explained later ) .",

    "<S> we have mapped six molecular cloud cores in the orion a giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) , whose kinetic temperatures range from 10 to 30 k , in ccs and n@xmath0h@xmath1 with nobeyama 45 m radio telescope to study their chemical characteristics . </S>",
    "<S> we identified 31 intensity peaks in the ccs and n@xmath0h@xmath1 emission in these molecular cloud cores . </S>",
    "<S> it is found for cores with temperatures lower than @xmath2 25 k that the column density ratio of @xmath3(n@xmath0h@xmath1)/@xmath3(ccs ) is low toward starless core regions while it is high toward star - forming core regions , in case that we detected both of the ccs and n@xmath0h@xmath1 emission . </S>",
    "<S> this is very similar to the tendency found in dark clouds ( kinetic temperature @xmath2 10 k ) . </S>",
    "<S> the criterion found in the orion a gmc is @xmath3(n@xmath0h@xmath1)/@xmath3(ccs ) @xmath4 . in some cases , </S>",
    "<S> the ccs emission is detected toward protostars as well as the n@xmath0h@xmath1 emission . </S>",
    "<S> secondary late - stage ccs peak in the chemical evolution caused by co depletion may be a possible explanation for this . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the chemical variation of ccs and n@xmath0h@xmath1 can also be used as a tracer of evolution in warm ( 10@xmath525 k ) gmc cores . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , some protostars do not accompany n@xmath0h@xmath1 intensity peaks but are associated with dust continuum emitting regions , suggesting that the n@xmath0h@xmath1 abundance might be decreased due to co evaporation in warmer star - forming sites . </S>"
