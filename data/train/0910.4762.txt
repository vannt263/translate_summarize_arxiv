    "it has been theoretically understood since long ago  @xcite that a static electric field @xmath4 can spontaneously produce electron - positron pairs due to quantum tunneling .",

    "n = 1 ^ +  ( - n )  , [ ehs ] with @xmath5 and @xmath6 being respectively the charge and the mass of the electron .",
    "the generalizations of this formula to varying external field include the special cases of a spatially constant field with the time dependence @xmath7  @xcite and of the field pointing along the @xmath8 axis and arbitrarily depending on the light cone variable @xmath9  @xcite , a complete review of the topic can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "being thoroughly investigated theoretically , the schwinger process has no experimental evidence so far .",
    "the reason is that any practically available strength of the electric field is much smaller than the critical value @xmath10v / cm at which the probability described by eq.([ehs ] ) would not be exponentially suppressed .",
    "it has been suggested recently  @xcite that the pair creation can be significantly stimulated by superimposing a relatively weak photon beam with a ( quasi)static electric field .",
    "it was shown  @xcite that in the presence of an external photon the barrier for the tunneling is effectively lowered and the negative exponential power in the pair production rate is decreased in absolute value . in particular , for a photon with energy @xmath11 propagating perpendicularly to the field @xmath4 the negative exponential power in the pair production rate at the threshold @xmath12 is modified from @xmath13 to @xmath14 , leading to a large exponential enhancement of the rate .    in the present paper we consider the photon induced pair creation in an external electric field in the realistic limit @xmath15 and at lower photon energies @xmath1 for which higher beam intensity can be practical . under this condition",
    "the leading effects are described by the so - called keldysh parameter @xmath16 , with @xmath17 being the angle between the photon momentum and the electric field @xmath4 .",
    "we do not assume the keldysh parameter to be small and find the exact in this parameter expression for the attenuation rate @xmath18 for the photon beam intensity due to the pair production in the form _",
    "( k ) = 2 e ^ -  [ i _ 1  ( _ ) ] ^ 2  , [ kba ] with @xmath19 being the standard notation for the modified bessel function . our consideration here",
    "is restricted to the lowest order in the ratio @xmath20 , and in this order we find that only the photons whose polarization is parallel to @xmath21 stimulate the pair production ( hence the notation @xmath22 ) , while the effect for the orthogonal polarization , @xmath23 , arises only in a higher order in this ratio .",
    "the exponential behavior of the bessel function in eq.([kba ] ) at large argument matches the low @xmath11 limit of the exponential expression found in ref .",
    "@xcite , so that our result describes both the exponential and the pre - exponential factors in this limit .    the photon - induced pair creation can be calculated in a standard way in terms of the imaginary part of the electromagnetic vacuum polarization function @xmath24 in external field : = - 1   [ kapi ] starting from the known  @xcite general formulas for @xmath24 . in fact",
    "the expression ( [ kba ] ) is very recently found  @xcite in this way by considering a small @xmath11 expansion of the contour integral representation of the imaginary part of the polarization tensor for photons in a constant e field . in this paper",
    "we do not use this approach but rather find the result ( [ kba ] ) by considering the schwinger pair creation as a semiclassical tunneling process , and using the euclidean - space description of the tunneling trajectory  @xcite . in such semiclassical approach , instead of summing the loop graphs for the vacuum - to - vacuum transition amplitude , one uses the so - called bounce  @xcite trajectory in the euclidean space time similarly to the methods used in treatment of false vacuum decay  @xcite . in order to find the pair creation rate stimulated by photons we use",
    "the recently developed  @xcite extension of this approach using a thermal calculation of the tunneling rate .",
    "an appropriate interpretation of the result for the probability of the process at finite temperature in a thermal bath allows to extract the behavior of the rate induced by individual particles present in the bath .",
    "( in fact the technique allows to find the probability of pair production induced by arbitrary number of particles ) .    in what follows",
    "we provide the actual calculation leading to the expression ( [ kba ] ) . in the section 2 we briefly recapitulate the quasiclassical method of calculating the probability rate , and in the section 3",
    "derive the expression for the rate at nonzero temperature @xmath25 in terms of expansion in powers of @xmath26 . in the section 4",
    "we relate the thermal result to the contribution of the one - photon induced process and thus we find the probability described by eq.([kba ] ) .",
    "finally , the section 4 contains the discussion and concluding remarks .",
    "the euclidean space approach  @xcite to tunneling is based on constructing a localized solution to the classical equations of motion , which solution is called a bounce , and the exponential factor in the rate is determined by the euclidean action on the bounce @xmath27 as @xmath28 , while the pre - exponential factor is derived  @xcite from a calculation of the euclidean path integral around the bounce trajectory .",
    "it can be also mentioned that if in the problem there is a separation of scales such that some degrees of freedom can be considered as soft on the scale of the size of the bounce , both the exponential factor  @xcite and the pre - exponential one  @xcite can be treated within an effective theory of those soft variables .    in order for an electron - positron pair to be created",
    ", the electric field @xmath4 has to produce the work equal to @xmath29 .",
    "this requires the length @xmath30 , and at a field weaker than the critical , @xmath31 the length scale @xmath32 greatly exceeds the electron compton wave length , @xmath33 .",
    "in this situation the tunneling bounce configuration in the problem of pair creation can be treated within an effective low - energy theory with essentially classical action for the electrons in external electromagnetic field : s = m dl - e a _ d x ^ , [ effa ] with @xmath34 being the coordinate of the particle and @xmath35 is the element of the length of the particle trajectory . in a constant electric field in the @xmath36 direction ,",
    "@xmath37 , one can write the potential as @xmath38 and thus rewrite the action ( [ effa ] ) for a closed trajectory in terms of its length @xmath39 and the area @xmath40 that it encircles : s = m l - ee a. thus the trajectory extremizing the action , the bounce , is a circle in the @xmath41 plane with the radius r = [ radius ] as shown in fig .  1 . ( the diameter of the circle is such that the work produced by the constant electric field on that distance is equal to the total mass of the pair produced @xmath42 . )",
    "[ inst ]    the value of the action on this trajectory is @xmath43 , in a complete agreement with the leading exponent in the exact expression ( [ ehs ] ) under the condition @xmath15 , which ensures applicability of the semiclassical treatment .",
    "as mentioned , we eventually find the photon - induced pair production rate by extracting the corresponding one - particle contribution from an expression for the schwinger process at a finite temperature",
    ". therefore we start with calculating the probability rate per unit volume at nonzero temperature . for a sufficiently small temperature , namely @xmath44",
    ", one can still employ the same effective euclidean one particle action ( [ effa ] ) , except that now the system lives on a cylinder with a periodic euclidean time with the period equal to the inverse temperature @xmath45 .",
    "equivalently one can consider the system on the ( t , x ) plane with periodic in @xmath46 boundary conditions ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "[ poten ]    moreover for the purpose of the present calculation it is sufficient to consider arbitrarily low but non vanishing temperature , and we thus also impose the condition @xmath47 which even more justifies the applicability of the effective action and also ensures that the circular bounce fully fits within one period .",
    "the action for the bounce and thus the probability of pair creation does not change in this limit if the electromagnetic field is considered as an external object without dynamics of its own .",
    "we however are interested in the effects produced by the photons in the thermal bath and we should thus consider the dynamics of the electromagnetic field by adding to the low energy action the kinetic term for the field @xmath48 . in order to exclude the contribution of the energy of the external field to the action one can make the shift in the definition of the electromagnetic potential : @xmath49 and write the effective action as s[x , a ] = m dl - e e a - e a _ d x ^ - 1 4 d ^ 4 x f _ ^ 2  , [ effap ] where @xmath48 is the shifted potential with the corresponding field strength @xmath50 .",
    "generally , the rate is found  @xcite by calculating the partition function around the one bounce configuration = x _ a _ . with effective one particle euclidean action @xmath51 $ ] given by the expression ( [ effap ] ) , and @xmath52 being the space - time volume of the system .",
    "the zero temperature result corresponds to the limit @xmath53 , and , without any corrections from exchange of the photons , yields the well known expression for the rate =  ( - ) , [ gam1 ] which corresponds to the first term in the sum ( [ ehs ] ) .",
    "the self interaction of the particle ( one - loop correction : the correction of the type ( a ) in fig .",
    "2 ) was taken into account in paper @xcite .",
    "it amounts to a finite additive term in the exponent , @xmath54 .",
    "the thermal effect that eventually leads to the result in the present paper can in fact be viewed as a thermal distortion of this self - interaction term due to the modification of the photon propagator on the cylinder as compared to an infinite space - time . in the equivalent periodic picture of fig .",
    "2 this modification can be considered as an interaction between the periodic copies of the current loops with the photon propagator being that in an infinite space - time ( the corrections of type ( b ) ) .    before proceeding to a calculation of this latter effect",
    "we note that the corrections due to the thermal fluctuations of the shape of the bounce , i.e. deviations from the circle , are of a higher order in @xmath55 and are entirely neglected in the present treatment .",
    "the contribution to the action due to such interaction has the following form s _",

    "` flat ' space time with periodic copies this factor arises for the following reason .",
    "each term @xmath69 in the sum corresponds to the additional action within _ the pair _ of the @xmath70 and @xmath71 current loops .",
    "thus the additional action per one loop , i.e. per one period @xmath65 , is one half of that . in the picture of a current loop on the cylinder",
    "the equivalent explanation of this factor is that the self - interaction of the loop through @xmath60 windings of the photon propagator around the cylinder does not contain any notion of the sign of @xmath60 . therefore summing over the positive and negative values of @xmath60 would be double counting .    using the pre - exponential factor from eq.([gam1 ] ) and the expression ( [ dels ] ) for @xmath72 , one can write the rate of pair creation at finite temperature in the form =  ( - - s )  , [ temp_rate ] so that the thermal enhancement factor is @xmath73 .",
    "in a microscopic description of the thermal effects , the enhancement of pair creation in a bath at finite temperature arises through the stimulation of the process by the photons present in the bath .",
    "the dependence of the photon induced process on the photon energy @xmath11 then translates into the dependence on the temperature @xmath25 after averaging over the thermal distribution of the photons with the standard density function n ( ) = [ photdis ] with @xmath74 .",
    "the number of photons involved in each of these microscopic processes can be readily identified by the power of the factor @xmath75 . since the thermal correction ( [ dels ] ) in the action is proportional to @xmath75 , the one - photon contribution to the thermal rate",
