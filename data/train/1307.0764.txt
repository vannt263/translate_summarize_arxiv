    "the close - packed pu planes with abc and ab stacking interspersed with h atoms provides a framework to explore intermediate stoichiometries .",
    "the experimentally observed hysteresis , attributed to structural origins,@xcite can be explained based on the stoichiometric dependence of which type of stacking has a lower calculated energy ( using the gga+u approach ) . the calculated stoichiometry puh@xmath4 at which the preference switches from abc stacking to ab stacking , slightly above @xmath36 , agrees well with the lower limit of the region in which experiment observes the two types of crystal structures coexisting.@xcite    overall , the dft calculations on the pu - h system reveal very small energy differences ( relative to room temperature ) for multiple changes to the system : the afm solutions lie below the fm solutions by small energies , changing the arrangements of the h atoms on tetrahedral and octahedral sites leads to small changes in the energy , and even changing the stoichiometry itself affects the formation energy by small amounts .",
