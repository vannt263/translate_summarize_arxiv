    "it is well known that the subdifferential operator of a proper lower semicontinuous convex function is maximally monotone .",
    "subdifferential operators also belong to the class of @xmath9 monotone ( also known as rectangular ) operators which was introduced by brezis and and haraux @xcite ; see also @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the sum of two maximally monotone operators is monotone ; maximality , however , is guaranteed only in presence of a constraint qualification @xcite .",
    "the problem of finding the zeros of the sum of two maximally monotone operators is an active topic in optimization as it captures the key problem of minimizing a sum of two convex functions .",
    "more broadly , from an optimization perspective , constrained optimization problems , convex feasibility problem as well as many other optimization problems can be interpreted and recast as the problem of finding the zeros of the sum of two maximally monotone operators .",
    "most methods for solving the sum problem are splitting algorithms ; the most popular of which is the celebrated douglas  rachford method , which was adopted to the monotone operator framework by lions and mercier @xcite .",

    ", this inclusion is strict  sometimes even extremely so in the sense that @xmath21 may be a singleton while @xmath22 may be the entire space ; see example  [ ex:1 ] .",
    "this likely has discouraged efforts to obtain a better description of these ranges . however , and somewhat surprisingly , we are able to obtain  under fairly mild assumptions on @xmath4 and @xmath23  the simple and elegant formulae    equation ( -t_(a , b))(a - b)(a+b )    and    equation t_(a , b)(a - b)(a+b ) ,    where the  near equality \" of two sets @xmath24 and @xmath25 , denoted by @xmath26 , means that the two sets have the same relative interior ( the interior with respect to the closed affine hull ) and the same closure",
    ". when @xmath27 and @xmath28 are subdifferential operators , which is the key setting in convex optimization , the above formulae can be written as    equation ( -t_(f , g))(f - g)(f^*+g^ * )    and    equation t_(f , g)(f - g^*)(f^*+g ) .",
    "these results are interesting because the problem of finding a point in @xmath29 has a solution if and only if @xmath30 ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",

    "in addition to our main results , we show that the well - known conclusion of brezis - haraux theorem @xcite is optimal in the sense that actual equality may fail ( see example  [ br - h - opt1 ] and proposition  [ cn : ex5 ] ) .",
