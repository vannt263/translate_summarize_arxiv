    "the chiral two - dimensional electron ( c2deg )  gas in bilayer graphene ( blg ) in a quantizing magnetic field exhibits a rich variety of broken - symmetry states in mean - field theory .",
    "these states have been extensively studiedbarlasreview in the zeroth - energy landau level @xmath2 which is eightfold degenerate when valley @xmath3 and spin @xmath4 degrees of freedom are counted because of the presence of an extra orbital degree of freedom @xmath5@xcite@xmath6 these broken symmetry states are best described using the pseudospin language where a valley pseudospin up(down )  is associated with valley @xmath7 and an orbital pseudospin up(down )  is associated with the orbital @xmath8 in this language , the broken - symmetry states are spin , valley , or orbital quantum hall ferromagnets ( qhfs ) .",
    "they are gapped , have charged quasiparticle excitations , and support an integer quantum hall effect@xcite .",
    "the effect of the coulomb interaction on the higher landau levels @xmath9 has so far received less attention . in a recent paper@xcite",
    ", we have shown that the c2deg in these levels behaves as a valley ising qhf  when the filling factor of these levels ( which are fourfold degenerate ) is odd , i.e. when @xmath10 the c2deg at these fillings is spin polarized and the two valley states with valley pseudospin @xmath11 are degenerate at zero and at some finite values of the bias @xmath12 ( the electrical potential difference between the two layers ) . for @xmath13 transitions",
    "occur between states with total spin and total valley pseudospin @xmath14 changing the bias can induce first - order transitions between the different spin and valley - pseudospin ground states .",
    "the phase diagram for different landau levels shows a marked difference between the positive @xmath15 and negative @xmath16 landau levels .",
    "the ising behavior of the higher landau levels contrasts with that of landau level @xmath2 where valley , spin , or orbital qhf can all have a @xmath17 symmetry@xcite .",
    "ising qhfs have been studied previously both theoretically@xcite and experimentally@xcite in a variety of semiconductor quantum wells or bilayer systems . a complete classification of the qhf states , including isotropic , easy - axis , and easy - plane qhfs has been derived for a model of two nearby , infinitely narrow , two - dimensional layers@xcite .",
    "a well - known case of ising qhf occurs when two levels with different electrical subbands or landau level indices are brought to degeneracy by tuning the electrical bias or the zeeman coupling at even filling factor .",
    "the _ valley_-pseudospin ising transitions in the higher landau levels , however , occur at odd filling factors and are of a slightly different nature : they do not occur near landau level crossings . as in other ising qhfs , however , the exchange part of the coulomb interaction energy plays a major role as it competes with the noninteracting energy .",
    "what is special with blg is that an electronic state is described by a four - component spinor and so consists of a superposition of four states with different orbital wave functions .",
    "as the bias is varied , the coefficients of this superposition are modified and so is the coulomb exchange interaction which is orbital - dependent .",
    "in a way , the ising transitions in blg occur in part because of a change in the internal structure  of the electron .    the discontinuous transitions between spin - polarized states at @xmath18 that occur when the bias is varied cause abrupt changes in the transport gap that may explain some recent experimental results@xcite on the transport properties of the c2deg in bilayer graphene .",
    "in the present work , we study the behavior of the transport gap of the c2deg with bias at odd fillings of the higher landau levels .",
    "we first show that the ising behavior found previously@xcite should also occur in chirally - stacked multilayer graphene , at least at zero bias .",
    "we then compute the energy of different types of charged excitations of the ising ground states .",
    "we consider bulk quasiparticles ( quasi - electrons and quasi - holes ) and topological quasiparticles ( skyrmions and antiskyrmions ) . in each case",
    ", we evaluate the transport gap due to the excitation of a particle - antiparticle pair using a microscopic hartree - fock calculation .",
    "our approach allows us to compute the excitation gap at finite zeeman and/or bias and takes into account the possibility of intertwined spin and valley - pseudospin textures . when appropriate ( at zero bias or zeeman coupling ) , we also compute the transport gap using a long - wavelength approximation of the hartree - fock energy functional .",
    "when the zeeman coupling is taken into account , we find that valley skyrmions are the lowest - energy excitations in bilayer graphene , at least for @xmath19 .",
    "this contrasts with previously studied ising systems where skyrmions are not the lowest - energy excitations@xcite .",
    "the skyrmions that we find have either a spin or a valley - pseudospin texture , but not both@xcite and , as in monolayer graphene@xcite , they exist only in a small range of bias or zeeman coupling .",
    "magnetic ising ferromagnets show an hysteretic behavior of the magnetization as the magnetic field is swept upward or downward . in the absence of disorder and at @xmath20",
    "the external magnetic field must exceed a certain coercive field in order to produce the spin reversal .",
    "we find a similar behavior with bias for the valley pseudospins and so we compute the coercive bias for landau levels @xmath21 owing to the fact that more valley - flip transitions are possible in levels @xmath22 than in @xmath23 we find that the hysteretic behavior for @xmath22 is also more complex , with a very large coercive field .    at finite temperature or in a disordered system , domains with particular valley - pseudospin orientations",
    "are formed in the c2deg .",
    "regions of different valley pseudospins are separated by domain walls which can have complicated patterns .",
    "when domain walls are present , the electronic band structure and so the electron - hole excitation gap is modulated in space . in the coherent region of a domain wall ,",
    "the valley pseudospins rotate from one polarization to the other . for a linear domain wall",
    ", the coherent region forms a linear channel of a few magnetic lengths in width . at the center of these regions ,",
    "the band gap is minimal .",
    "it should be possible , then , to excite electron - holes pairs that are confined to a coherent region of a wall and that have smaller excitation energy than the bulk electron - hole or the skyrmion - antiskyrmion pairs .",
    "these mobile particles may be responsiblejungwirth for the increase in dissipation and breakdown of the quantum hall effect that is observed in some ising qhfs@xcite .",
    "we compute the energy of such excitations and find that , in some range of bias , they can be the lowest - energy excitations .",
    "this paper is organized in the following way .",
    "sections ii and iii introduce the tight - binding model and the electronic states in bilayer graphene as well as most of the hartree - fock formalism necessary to derive the energy gap for the particle - antiparticle pairs .",
    "section iv discusses the hysteretic behavior of the ising qhfs and extend this behavior to other , chirally - stacked , multilayer graphene structures .",

    "if the domain wall loops are dense enough to overlap , these confined quasiparticles can cross the sample by scattering from one loop to an adjacent one and then increase the dissipation in the sample , creating magnetoresistance spikes that are detected near integer fillings close to the transition between the ordered and the paramagnetic phases at finite temperature .",
    "as far as we know , there has been to date no experimental study of such effect in the higher landau levels of bilayer graphene .",
    "the domain wall solution discussed in this work comes from the coulomb interaction .",
    "it is different from the domain walls studied before in bilayer graphene@xcite which were artificially created in the middle of a double - gated bilayer graphene sample by placing it in an electric gate where the potential profile changes sign across the center@xcite .",
    "domain walls have also recently been studied in bilayer graphene but at zero magnetic field@xcite .",
    "another type of excitation should be considered in addition to those studied in this work .",
    "it consists of confined textured excitations in the coherent regions of the domain walls i.e. confined solitons and antisolitons of the valley pseudospin in the one - dimensional coherent region of a wall .",
    "it is possible to extract an effective pseudospin hamiltonian for such excitations by combining the long - wavelength energy functional presented in this paper with the microscopic hartree - fock calculation .",
    "this has been done previously in ising qhfs@xcite and in the coherent stripe phase in a semiconductor double quantum - well system@xcite .",
    "we leave this problem to future work .",
    "r. ct was supported by a grant from the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada ( nserc ) .",
    "computer time was provided by calcul qubec and compute canada .",
    "the total density in landau level @xmath92 is given by@xmath457 in the absence of valley coherence , the spin density field in real space is given by@xmath458and@xmath459similarly , in the absence of spin coherence , the valley - pseudospin field given in real space by@xmath460and@xmath461    these density and fields contain the character of the different landau level orbitals @xmath72 in @xmath341 that enter the definition of the spinors in eq .",
    "( [ spinor1],[spinor2 ] ) with the wave functions in the symmetric gauge .",
    "since these spinors contain a mixture of the orbitals @xmath462 and @xmath463 the resulting field pattern of a skyrmion in real space is complex . to get a simpler visualization of the spin and pseudospin fields , it is useful to use a projected representation that we define in the following way .",
