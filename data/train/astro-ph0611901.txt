    "the assembly of the most massive galaxies is a key test of cold dark matter ( cdm ) models of galaxy formation , as the ongoing growth of massive galaxies via mergers is a generic feature of hierarchical cdm models .",
    "observationally , the most massive galaxies have little ongoing star formation , and the bulk of their stellar mass was formed at @xmath3 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "if there is appreciable growth of these galaxies at @xmath4 , this must be due to galaxy mergers , as predicted by the hierarchical cdm models .",
    "evidence for the ongoing assembly of massive galaxies is inconclusive .",
    "while the stellar mass within the red galaxy population has doubled since @xmath5 @xcite , this appears to be due to the truncation of star formation in blue galaxies , and the role of mergers is poorly known . @xcite and @xcite , using close galaxy pairs ,",
    "conclude that @xmath6 red galaxies grow rapidly via mergers since @xmath5 , while @xcite , using similar techniques , find that the merger rate of @xmath7 red galaxies is only @xmath8 . using the galaxy space density ,",
    "@xcite find that the stellar masses of @xmath7 red galaxies grow by @xmath9 since @xmath10 , while others find no significant growth over similar redshift ranges ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    there is an additional route to constraining the evolution of galaxies , which is to use their clustering properties .",
    "building upon the theoretically understood evolution of the dark matter halo population , we can obtain complementary constraints which bypass the model dependence of stellar evolution or merger times as a function of projected distance .",
    "we illustrate this approach in this _ letter _ , presenting evidence from the evolution of their clustering that luminous red galaxies undergo merging or disruption between @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "we use galaxies in the @xmath13 botes field , which has been imaged in the optical and infrared by the noao deep wide - field ( ndwfs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and _ spitzer _ irac shallow surveys @xcite .",
    "we use a luminous ( @xmath14 ) subset of the botes red galaxy sample which was selected from the imaging using empirical photometric redshifts and an evolving restframe @xmath15 color criterion @xcite .",
    "this subset includes galaxy samples in three redshift slices : @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 with comoving volumes of @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively , and at each redshift , galaxies are selected to be above a luminosity threshold such that the sample has a constant comoving number density ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "our results are based on the observed evolution of the angular clustering of these samples , containing a few thousand galaxies each .",
    "we transform from models of the spatial clustering to angular clustering using a redshift distribution model which accounts for the small measured uncertainties of the photometric redshifts ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "we describe the clustering measurements and modeling in detail in @xcite .",
    "our galaxy samples have been selected to have constant @xmath24 .",
    "we find that their clustering evolves very little , with @xmath25 .",
    "we begin with an analytic argument to show that these galaxies can not be undergoing a common luminosity evolution history , such as pure passive evolution , without any mergers . in such a scenario",
    "each galaxy preserves its identity and no galaxy leaves or enters the sample . if we assume that galaxies and mass follow the same velocity field , and retain their identities , then the continuity equation in the linear regime requires that @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "if we define @xmath27 and the growth function @xmath28 then @xmath29 $ ] @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : b_vs_z ] , this prediction is in good agreement with our numerical simulations with passive evolution ( see   [ sec : passive ] ) . assuming scale - independent , deterministic biasing therefore predicts evolution in @xmath30 which is not in agreement with the observations .",
    "in fact , we find that passive evolution can not fit the trend of the central values of the clustering strength for any plausible cosmology .    to go further we need a way of connecting the galaxies we observe with the host dark matter halos whose evolution theory predicts .",
    "the halo model ( see e.g.  @xcite for a review ) has provided us with such a physically informative and flexible means of describing galaxy bias .",
    "the key insight is that an accurate prediction of galaxy clustering requires a knowledge of the occupation distribution of objects in halos ( the hod ) and their spatial distribution . in combination with ingredients from n - body simulations",
    "a specified hod makes strong predictions about a wide array of galaxy clustering statistics .",
    "the formalism thus allows us to use observations of galaxy clustering to constrain the connection between galaxies and their host dark matter halos at each @xmath31 , and in particular to show that the luminous galaxies in the ndwfs have undergone significant merging or disruption between @xmath1 and @xmath2 by comparing the hod inferred from the @xmath2 clustering data to one which is passively evolved from the inferred hod at @xmath1 .",
    "our modeling of galaxy clustering is based on mock catalogs constructed within the hod framework by populating halos in a cosmological n - body simulation .",
    "we use a high resolution simulation of a @xmath32cdm cosmology ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) .",
    "the linear theory power spectrum was computed by evolution of the coupled einstein , fluid and boltzmann equations using the code described in @xcite .",
    "this code agrees well with _",
    "@xcite , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the simulation employed @xmath38 particles of mass @xmath39 in a periodic cube of side @xmath40mpc using a _ treepm _",
    "code @xcite .",
    "the plummer equivalent softening was @xmath41kpc ( comoving ) .    for each output",
    "we generate a catalog of halos using the friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm @xcite with a linking length of @xmath42 the mean inter - particle spacing .",
    "this procedure partitions the particles into equivalence classes , by linking together all particle pairs separated by less than a distance @xmath43 .",
    "the halos correspond roughly to particles with @xmath44 times the background density .",
    "our mass definition uses the sum of the particle masses in the halo , however to obtain better correspondence between our definition of halo mass and that implicitly defined by the mass functions of @xcite and @xcite we rescaled the masses by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the fof mass in units of @xmath47 . with this redefinition",
    "the mass function in the simulation lies between those of @xcite and @xcite , differing from them by less than 10% in the mass range of interest .    to make mock catalogs we use a halo model which distinguishes between central and satellite galaxies .",
    "we choose a mean occupancy of halos : @xmath48 .",
    "each halo either hosts a central galaxy or does not , while the number of satellites is poisson distributed about a mean @xmath49 . with the luminosity - threshold samples ,",
    "we parameterize @xmath50 with 4 parameters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath51 \\label{eqn : ncen}\\ ] ] and @xmath52 for @xmath53 and zero otherwise .",
    "different functional forms have been proposed in the literature , but the current form is flexible enough for our purposes . including a different low mass roll - off in the satellite term , following @xcite and @xcite , does not alter our basic conclusions .    given an hod and the halo catalogs we can produce a mock catalog in one of two ways .",
    "central galaxies always live at the minimum of the halo potential . we either place satellite galaxies assuming an nfw profile @xcite with a concentration - mass relation fit to the halos in the simulation or anoint @xmath54 dark matter particles , chosen at random , as galaxies .",
    "the two methods produce very similar , though not identical , clustering , with the biggest differences on mpc scales .",
    "an analytic model ( described in * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) also produces very similar results .",
    "the differences between the methods are smaller than the observational errors , so we shall neglect them henceforth .      from the model galaxy positions we compute @xmath55 in real space by direct pair counting in the periodic box for separations @xmath56mpc .",
    "beyond @xmath57mpc we extrapolate assuming a constant bias .",
    "the redshift distribution is used to convert @xmath55 into @xmath58 using eq .",
    "( 50 ) of @xcite , giving the predicted clustering for any set of hod parameters .",
    "we fit to the data assuming gaussian errors with the covariance matrices of @xcite , and assume a 5% error on the number density of galaxies .",
    "figure  [ fig : wtheta ] compares the best fitting hod model predictions to the data at @xmath1 and 0.5 .    in order to propagate the observational errors into uncertainties in the hod ( eqs .",
    "[ eqn : ncen],[eqn : nsat ] ) we used a markov chain monte - carlo method ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as detailed in @xcite .",
    "we found that the data were unable to rule out models with @xmath59 and @xmath60 , which we regard as unlikely for large red galaxies , so we impose a prior which penalizes @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "tests indicate that surveys twice as large would not need this prior , though with this prior even our chains converged well .",
    "because the mock catalog generation using nfw profiles is very fast and requires little memory we use this to generate the chains .      for a subset of 250 of the models at @xmath1 we use the particle - based method to produce mock catalogs which we passively evolve to @xmath2 simply by tracking the particles based on their i d .",
    "the positions and halo memberships of these tagged particles are followed .",
    "we expect the hod to be more robust than the small - scale clustering for these particles , but we show the latter in figure  [ fig : wtheta ] for completeness . looking at the difference in the hods is also more informative , and gives us a clue as to what physics may be missing from pure passive evolution .",
    "a comparison of the hod of the passively evolved samples with the hods which best fit the @xmath63 data indicates that evolution produces too many galaxies in high mass halos , as shown in figure  [ fig : hod ] .",
    "a similar conclusion can be reached by comparing the clustering of the passively evolved models to the data in figure  [ fig : wtheta ]  the excess clustering on small scales from passive models clearly indicates that the models overpredict galaxy pairs within the same halo , i.e. , they predict too many satellite galaxies in high mass halos .",
    "another indication of the excess is that the satellite fraction in the passively evolved models is @xmath64 while that in the best fitting models is @xmath65 .",
    "there must be some physical process which reduces the number of galaxies in massive halos , and the most natural candidates are dynamical friction and tidal stripping which act to merge massive satellites with the central galaxy or disrupt them . based on figure  [ fig : hod ] , at high halo masses @xmath66 of the satellites in the passively evolved catalogs",
    "must have disappeared by @xmath2 .",
    "we caution that our calculation ignores sources and sinks .",
    "if galaxies can enter or leave the sample due to rapid evolution of their star formation rates , interpretting the evolution of galaxy clustering is non - trivial .",
    "however , @xmath4 blue galaxies with masses comparable to the most massive red galaxies are rare , and ( at least at @xmath67 ) red galaxies have little cold gas to fuel renewed bursts of star formation .",
    "there is a subtlety to bear in mind with these statistics .",
    "merging results in a small fraction of @xmath1 galaxies disappearing by @xmath2 .",
    "so we should really compare the passively evolved catalog ( with @xmath68 ) to a fitted one with a slightly lower number density  the `` true '' @xmath2 descendants of the @xmath1 galaxies .",
    "the cut - off mass scale for this catalog would be slightly larger than our fits and we should shift the mass definition in the hod accordingly .",
    "we estimate the size of this shift , by considering the evolution of the central galaxies , to be @xmath69 and in figure  [ fig : hod ] we increase the mass scale of the hod inferred from the @xmath2 data accordingly ( though this shift does not change our conclusions ) .    to estimate the impact of the disappeared satellites on the growth of the central galaxy or the boost of the intracluster light ( icl ) in the halo , we make the following simple model . by matching the number density of halos above mass @xmath70 with that of galaxies above luminosity @xmath71 ( we use the @xmath72-band lfs of @xcite ) , we can relate the central galaxy luminosity to halo mass ( the luminous end of the lf is dominated by central galaxies as shown in @xcite ) . for our sample , at @xmath2 a halo of @xmath73 on average hosts a central galaxy of @xmath74 , with @xmath75 for massive halos .",
    "if we also assume that the satellite lf has the same shape as the global lf , we can use the fitted hods to find the number of satellites and integrate to measure their total light .",
    "we find that in such halos satellites on average have a total lumnosity of @xmath76 , so if this is what is left after @xmath0 of the satellites disappeared , the satellites would have contributed @xmath77 of the current stellar mass to the central galaxy or a similar mass to the icl . for halos of @xmath78",
    "the contribution is @xmath79 .",
    "these numbers are _ upper bounds _ , since satellites may have lost just enough mass to leave our sample .",
    "note that the stellar material resides in the inner regions of the halo , where the potential well is the deepest , and is the last material to be disrupted .",
    "an `` average '' satellite would need to lose 40% of its stellar mass , or decrease its surface brightness , to drop out of the sample .",
    "analyzing samples with lower luminosities would help us constrain this .",
    "we are unable , without further modeling , to differentiate between satellites fueling the growth of the central galaxy or the icl , which at lower redshift comprises @xmath80 of the stellar mass in groups and clusters @xcite .",
    "we can , however , form an @xmath81 relation at @xmath1 as above . by matching progenitor halos to their descendants at @xmath2 and assuming @xmath82 @xmath72-band magnitudes of fading we find @xmath83 growth in the stellar mass of the central galaxy between @xmath1 and @xmath84 .",
    "this would suggest the satellites also build an icl component ( the total stellar mass in the disappeared satellites , if it all ended up as icl , constitute @xmath85 of the total halo luminosity above the threshold ) .",
    "however this result relies on our assumption of a uniform lf and on stellar population evolution predictions , and needs to be constrained by observations of the icl .",
    "if we argue that there is little extended light at high @xmath31 , either the satellites may have lost just enough mass to leave the sample or the `` extra '' mass would accrete onto the central galaxy .",
    "we regard this dichotomy as an open question requiring further investigation .",
    "our conclusions are necessarily tentative due to the limited volume of the ndwfs botes survey , which does not probe the mass function above @xmath78 well .",
    "there are several areas where more or different data would be beneficial .",
    "tests using models of larger surveys indicate that doubling the survey volume removes the islands of parameter space which we have excluded with priors and shrinks the errors on the hod parameters by @xmath86 .",
    "a measurement of the space density of groups richer than several members would shrink the errors on the high mass end of the hod dramatically , but would require more volume than we have at present to contain a representative sample of rich groups",
    ". we also investigated the dependence of our results upon cosmology using similar simulations with different parameters .",
    "our results remain robust within the currently allowed range of models .",
    "this preliminary investigation shows the power of clustering measures to inform questions of the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "we find evidence for evolution in the red galaxy hod very different than that predicted by pure passive evolution models .",
    "our result is largely independent of models of red galaxy stellar populations and estimates of dynamical friction scales . with more data from the ndwfs and future surveys we hope to be able to trace in detail the formation history of the most massive galaxies in the universe .",
