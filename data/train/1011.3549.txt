    "the massless bosonic part of heterotic string effective action in the string frame is @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 , ( @xmath0 is the space - time dimension and @xmath5 is a number of abelian gauge fields ) ; @xmath6 possesses the `` most positive '' lorentz signature .",

    "in what follows , we assume that in the space - time of @xmath0 dimensions with @xmath17 commuting killing vector fields , all `` none - dynamical '' field components vanish : @xmath18 a , b,\\ldots=3,4,\\ldots d \\end{array}\\ ] ] and all field components and potentials depend only on two coordinates @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( one of which can be time - like or both are space - like ) .",
    "the coordinates @xmath19 , @xmath20 can be chosen so that @xmath21 takes a conformally flat form @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "as such coordinates , we choose `` geometrically defined '' functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( generalized weyl coordinates ) and use their linear combinations @xmath26 and @xmath27 : @xmath28 \\eta=\\beta - j\\alpha,\\end{array}\\quad\\right\\vert\\quad \\begin{array}{lccl}\\alpha : & & & \\det\\vert g_{ab}\\vert= \\epsilon\\alpha^2,\\\\[1.5ex ] \\beta:&&&\\partial_\\mu\\beta=\\epsilon \\varepsilon_\\mu{}^\\nu\\partial_\\nu\\alpha , \\end{array}\\qquad \\eta_{\\mu\\nu}=\\left(\\begin{array}{ll}\\epsilon_1 & 0\\\\ 0&\\epsilon_2\\end{array}\\right),\\hskip1ex \\varepsilon^{\\mu\\nu}=\\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\\\-1&0\\end{pmatrix},\\ ] ] where @xmath29 and @xmath30 , @xmath31 are the sign symbols which allow to consider various types of fields .",
    "the matrix @xmath32 is inverse to @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the field equations imply that the function @xmath35 is `` harmonic '' : @xmath36 and @xmath37 is defined as its `` harmonically '' conjugated .",
    "the parameter @xmath38 for @xmath39 ( the hyperbolic case ) and @xmath40 for @xmath41 ( the elliptic case ) .",
    "therefore the coordinates @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively both are real or complex conjugated to each other .",
    "as it was shown in ref .  , the symmetry reduced dynamics of massless bosonic fields in heterotic string effective theory is integrable and the solution of the dynamical equations is equivalent to solution of the spectral problem found there .",
    "this spectral problem is formulated in terms of four @xmath42-matrices @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 which should satisfy the linear system for @xmath47 with the algebraic conditions which determine the canonical jordan forms of its coefficients : @xmath48 2(w-\\eta)\\partial_\\eta \\mathbf{\\psi}=\\mathbf{v}(\\xi,\\eta ) \\mathbf{\\psi } \\end{array}\\quad\\right\\vert \\qquad\\begin{array}{l } { \\bf u}\\cdot{\\bf u } = { \\bf u},\\hskip3ex \\text{tr}{\\bf u}=d , \\\\[2ex ] { \\bf v}\\cdot{\\bf v } = { \\bf v},\\hskip3ex\\text{tr}{\\bf v}=d , \\end{array}\\ ] ] and this system should admit a symmetric matrix integral @xmath49 such that @xmath50 { \\bf k}^t(w)={\\bf k}(w ) \\end{array } \\qquad\\right\\vert\\qquad \\dfrac{\\partial\\mathbf{w}}{\\partial w}=\\mathbf{\\omega},\\qquad\\hskip1ex \\mathbf{\\omega}=\\begin{pmatrix } 0&i_d&0\\\\i_d&0 & 0\\\\0&0&0 \\end{pmatrix}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is a spectral parameter , @xmath52 is @xmath53-matrix , @xmath54 is a @xmath55 unit matrix . denoting by @xmath56 the lower right @xmath57 block of @xmath58 , we require also @xmath59 in accordance with ref .  , any solution @xmath60 of the the eqs .",
    "( [ linsys])([reality ] ) determines uniquely some solution of the dynamical equations and vice versa .",
    "given some solution as background for solitons , we denote its @xmath53-matrices by `` @xmath61 '' , and for one soliton on this background we assume @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a real constant and @xmath53-matrices @xmath64 and @xmath65 are real and depend on @xmath26 , @xmath27 only .",
    "we also assume @xmath66 . then the consistency conditions @xmath67 imply @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "this means that @xmath64 is degenerate and for simplicity , we consider @xmath64 having the rank equal to @xmath70 : @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are @xmath74-vector row and column respectively .",
    "substitution of the above expressions into the eqs .",
    "( [ linsys])([reality ] ) leads to a set of relations at the pole @xmath75 and at @xmath76 which can be solved explicitly .",
    "thus we obtain : @xmath77 the vector functions @xmath72 and @xmath73 are determined by the expressions @xmath78 where the real @xmath74-vectors @xmath79 and @xmath80 are constant ; @xmath79 is determined unequally in terms of @xmath80 , and the choice of @xmath80 is arbitrary provided it satisfies an algebraic constraint : @xmath81 thus , choosing any background solution and any real constant @xmath74-vector column @xmath80 which satisfy only the last mentioned constraint , we can construct the matrix @xmath58 whose components ( in accordance with the expressions given in ref .  )",
    "allow us to calculate all field components and potentials of generated one soliton solution .",
    "it is necessary to mention , however , that for stationary case , generation of one soliton can lead ( similarly to vacuum solitons of belinski and zakharov ) to a change of signature of metric and therefore the number of solitons in this case should be even . on the other hand ,",
