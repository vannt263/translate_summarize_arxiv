    "the perfect conductivity of metal - like matter of magnetic white dwarfs ( composed of ions suspended in the fermi - gas of relativistic electrons pervaded by magnetic field of a fairly high intensity , @xmath0 gauss ) suggests that these solid stars are capable of sustaining alfvn oscillations .",
    "if this true , this property should manifest itself by quasi - periodic oscillations of optical and x - ray emission detected form pulsating magnetic white dwarf stars , as was first pointed out in ref . 1 .",
    "in recent work@xcite , this proposition has been investigated in the model of solid star with poloidal and toroidal static magnetic field with focus on frequency spectra of node - free regime of alfvn vibrations .",
    "the main purpose of this last work was to elucidate the difference between frequency spectra of @xmath1-modes in white dwarfs having one and the same mass @xmath2 and radius @xmath3 , but different shapes of constant - in - time poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields .",
    "and it was found that each specific form of spatial configuration of static magnetic field is uniquely reflected in dependence of frequency upon overtone @xmath4 of nodeless vibrations .",
    "continuing this line of investigation , in this paper we explore the impact of magnetic field decay in pulsating magnetic white dwarf on its radiative activity . in section 2 ,",
    "a brief outline of magneto - solid - mechanical energy method of computing frequency of node - free lorentz - force - driven vibrations of white dwarf matter in time - varying magnetic field is given . in section 3",
    ", the theory of vibration - energy powered magneto - dipole emission produced by magnetic white dwarf vibrating in alfvn mode is considered in some details .",
    "the obtained results are summarized in section 4 .",
    "in what follows we confine our consideration to the solid - star model of magnetic ( da and db ) white dwarf with poloidal ( uniform and/or non - uniform internal and dipolar external ) magnetic field which is regarded as a slowly decreasing function time .",
    "the magnetic field decay is , most likely , determined by peculiarities of @xmath5-mechanism of ionization@xcite ( of hydrogen in da and helium in db stars ) .",

    "this leads to the following modification , compared to the case of constant in time field@xcite , of governing equations of magneto - solid - mechanics @xmath9,\\quad \\nabla\\cdot { \\bf u}({\\bf   r},t)=0 , \\quad \\nabla\\cdot { \\bf b}({\\bf r})=0,\\\\    \\label{e2.3 }   & & \\delta { \\bf j}({\\bf r},t)=\\frac{c}{4\\pi}[\\nabla\\times \\delta { \\bf b}({\\bf r},t ) ] ,   \\quad \\delta { \\bf b}({\\bf r},t)=b(t)\\nabla\\times [ { \\bf u }   ( { \\bf r},t)\\times { \\bf b}({\\bf r } ) ] .",

    "the frequency of such vibrations can be computed by using the following separable representation of toroidal field of differentially rotational material displacements@xcite",
    "@xmath13,\\quad \\nabla^2\\chi({\\bf r})=0 .",

    "it is easy to see that the magnetic field decay results in decreasing ( slow - down ) of circular frequency of vibrations @xmath20 and , hence , in the lengthening of the basic period of alfvn vibrations at a rate which is determined by the rate of time - evolving suppression of magnetic field intensity @xmath7 @xmath21 the most conspicuous and important feature of the vibration process under consideration is that magnetic field decay is accompanied by the loss of energy of alfvn vibrations @xmath22 the rate of vibration energy loss @xmath23 owes its origin to the time - evolving decay of intensity of magnetic field in the star .",
    "we consider a case when the white dwarf converts the energy of magneto - mechanical alfvn vibrations into the energy of magneto - dipole emission .",
    "this means that rate of the vibration energy loss equals to the larmor luminosity of magneto - dipole emission produced by oscillating dipole magnetic moment @xmath24 of magnetic white dwarf @xmath25 the interrelation between variations in total magnetic moment @xmath24 and the amplitude @xmath26 of magneto - mechanical oscillations can be consistently interpreted provided that both above characteristics oscillate with one and the same frequency @xmath27 .",
    "such a possibility is realized when the node - free torsional magneto - mechanical oscillations are accompanied by fluctuations of total magnetic moment preserving its direction : @xmath28 .",
    "if so , @xmath29 and @xmath16 must obey equations of similar form , namely @xmath30 it follows @xmath31 on substituting ( [ e2.13 ] ) , ( [ e2.14 ] ) , ( [ e3.4 ] ) in ( [ e3.1 ] ) we arrive at @xmath32 as a result , we arrive at the following law of magnetic field decay @xmath33 the lifetime of magnetic field @xmath34 is regarded as a parameter whose value must be established from relations between the period @xmath35 and its time derivative @xmath36 which are taken from observations . from above",
    "it follows that the time evolution of these latter quantities is determined by the time evolution of alvn period @xmath37 . in view of this",
    "we confine our analysis to characteristic peculiarities of @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the immediate consequence of above line of argument is the magnetic - field - decay induced lengthening of vibration period @xmath39 the rate of the alfvn period elongation is given by @xmath40 combining these equations we obtain @xmath41 these relation are independent of specific form of the magnetic field decay law and , therefore , can be used as general argument motivating interpretation of quasi - periodic oscillations of optical and x - ray emission from pulsating white dwarf as being produced by its global alfvn torsional vibrations .",

    "the most important insight to be gained from above theory is that the magnetic field decay in magnetic white dwarf undergoing lorentz - force - driven pulsations is inevitably accompanied by the loss of energy of alfvn oscillations of the star that causes its vibration period to lengthen at a rate proportional to the rate of magnetic field decay .",
    "this theory rests on equations of magneto - solid mechanics lying at the base of asteroseismology of non - convective compact objects of final stage of evolutionary track . in view of this the considered solid - star model of vibration - energy",
    "powered emission is appropriate not only for white dwarfs but also for neutron stars@xcite and for strange quark stars whose material is expected to be in solid aggregate state@xcite .",
    "it must be noted that the star capability of converting the energy of alfvn vibrations into energy of magneto - dipole electromagnetic emission has been considered long ago by hoyle , narlikar and wheeler@xcite , before the discovery of pulsars , as one of plausible mechanisms of radiative activity of neutron stars .",
    "the extensive consideration of such possibility in the context of pulsating radiation from quaking magnetars is given in our recent work@xcite .",
    "the general conclusion of this last and the present papers is that such possibility can be realized provided that lorentz - force - driven alfvn vibrations of non - convective solid star are accompanied by decay of internal magnetic field .",
    "the characteristic frequencies and periods of such oscillations are ploted in fig.3 for the solid - star model with typical for white dwarf masses and radii .",
    "the predicted elongation of vibration period should manifest itself in lengthening of period of oscillating optical and x - ray emission from white dwarf pulsating in @xmath1-mode and , hence , can be tested by observational means .",
