    "although the concept of pseudospin symmetry ( pss ) in nuclear single - particle spectra has been introduced for more than 40 years , the origin of pss and its breaking mechanism in realistic nuclei have not been fully understood . basically , whether or not its nature is perturbative remains an open problem . in this report",
    ", we mainly focus on our recent progress on this topic by combining the similarity renormalization group ( srg ) technique , supersymmetric ( susy ) quantum mechanics , and perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the pss was introduced in 1969 to explain the near degeneracy between pairs of single - particle states with the quantum numbers ( @xmath0 ) and ( @xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "they are regarded as the pseudospin doublets with modified quantum numbers ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "since the suggestion of pss , there have been comprehensive efforts to understand its origin . in 1997 , the pss was shown to be a relativistic symmetry of the dirac hamiltonian , and the equality in magnitude but difference in sign of the scalar @xmath3 and vector @xmath4 potentials was suggested as the exact pss limit @xcite .",
    "a more general condition @xmath5 @xcite can be better satisfied in exotic nuclei with diffuse potentials @xcite . on the other hand , since there exist no bound nuclei within such pss limit , the non - perturbative or dynamical nature of pss in realistic nuclei was suggested @xcite",
    "a recent overview on the pss investigation can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the readers are referred to refs .",
    "@xcite for some recent progress .",
    "recently , the perturbation theory was used to investigate the symmetries of the dirac hamiltonian and their breaking in realistic nuclei  @xcite , which provides a clear and quantitative way for investigating the perturbative nature of pss .",
    "on the other hand , the susy quantum mechanics can provide a pss - breaking potential without singularity  @xcite , and naturally interpret the unique feature that all states with @xmath6 have their own pseudospin partners except for the intruder states  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the srg technique fills the gap between the perturbation calculations and the susy descriptions by transforming the dirac hamiltonian into a diagonal form which keeps every operator hermitian  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we deem it promising to understand the pss and its breaking mechanism in a quantitative way by combining the srg technique , susy quantum mechanics , and perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "within the relativistic scheme , our starting point is the dirac hamiltonian for nucleons , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the dirac matrices , @xmath10 is the nucleon mass , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the scalar and vector potentials , respectively .    using the srg technique @xcite , the dirac hamiltonian can be transformed into a series of @xmath13 having a diagonal form . by keeping the leading - order terms of the kinetic energy , the central and spin - orbit ( so ) potentials , respectively",

    "one finds that eq .",
    "( [ eq : schrodinger ] ) is nothing but the schrdinger equation including a so term .    in the susy framework @xcite , a couple of hermitian conjugate first - order differential operators",

    "( [ eq : schrodinger ] ) , one can introduce the reduced superpotentials @xmath25 .",
    "in such a way , the susy partner hamiltonians @xmath26 and @xmath27 can be expressed as    [ eq : bb ] @xmath28}+\\frac{\\kappa}{mr}u,\\notag \\\\ \\label{eq : bb1}\\\\      h_2(\\kappa ) & = b^-_\\kappa b^+_\\kappa = { \\frac{1}{2m}}{\\left[}-\\frac{d^2}{dr^2}+\\frac{\\kappa(\\kappa-1)}{r^2}+q_\\kappa^2 + 2q_\\kappa u+u^2+\\frac{2\\kappa}{r}q_\\kappa+q'_\\kappa+u'{\\right]}+\\frac{\\kappa}{mr}u.\\notag \\\\ \\label{eq : bb2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that the hamiltonian @xmath29 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : schrodinger ] ) and its susy partner hamiltonian @xmath30 differ from @xmath26 and @xmath27 by a common constant @xmath31 , the so - called energy shift @xcite . by combining eqs .",

    "now it is important to see that not only does the @xmath24 structure appear in @xmath33 ( @xmath26 ) but also the @xmath34 structure explicitly appears in the susy partner hamiltonian @xmath35 ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the so - called pseudo - centrifugal barrier ( pcb ) terms @xmath36 are identical for the pseudospin doublets @xmath37 and @xmath38 with @xmath39 .    for the perturbation analysis @xcite , the hamiltonian @xmath35 is further expressed as @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the pss - conserving and pss - breaking terms , respectively . by requiring that @xmath42 should be proportional to @xmath19  @xcite , which is similar to the case of the so term in the normal scheme",

    "in this report , we take the scalar and vector potentials of the woods - saxon form from ref .",
    "@xcite , and take the neutron potentials in the nucleus @xmath49sn as an example .",
    "first of all , the pss - breaking potentials @xmath44 for the @xmath46 block obtained without and with the so term are shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "these potentials show several special features  @xcite , which are crucial for understanding the pss in a quantitative way : ( 1 ) they are regular functions of @xmath18 ; ( 2 ) their amplitudes directly determine the sizes of reduced pso splittings @xmath50 according to the perturbation theory ; ( 3 ) their shape , being negative at small radius but positive at large radius with a node at the surface region , can explain a general tendency that the pso splittings become smaller with increasing single - particle energies , and even reverse as approaching the single - particle threshold .    in order to identify the so effects ,",
    "the @xmath44 obtained with the so term is decomposed into the contributions from the first and second terms on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : vpso ] ) , denoted as @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "these two terms can be regarded as the indirect and direct effects of the so term , respectively , because the former one represents the so effects on @xmath44 via the reduced superpotentials @xmath32 , while the latter is nothing but the so potential itself appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : schrodinger ] ) .",
    "comparing to the result obtained without so term , it is found that the indirect effect on @xmath44 is only around @xmath53  mev , and eventually results in less influence on @xmath54 due to the cancellation between @xmath55  fm and @xmath56  fm regions . on the other hand ,",
    "the so potential @xmath57 is always positive with a surface - peak shape .",
    "it substantially raises the @xmath44 , in particular for the surface region .",
    "this systematically reduces the pso splittings @xmath54 .",
    "all of these properties are confirmed in the right panel of fig .",

    "the results obtained with and without so term are shown with filled and open symbols , respectively .",
    "it is found that the sizes of @xmath54 match the amplitudes of @xmath44 .",
    "the decreasing of the pso splittings with increasing single - particle energies is due to the special shape of @xmath44 .",
    "last but not least , the so term reduces the @xmath54 systematically by @xmath59  mev , and this effect can be understood now in a fully quantitative way .",
    "work is now in progress for exploring the origin of pss and its breaking mechanism by combining the srg , susy quantum mechanics , and perturbation theory .",
    "it is shown that while the spin - symmetry - conserving term appears in the single - particle hamiltonian @xmath33 , the pss - conserving term appears naturally in its susy partner hamiltonian @xmath60 .",
    "the eigenstates of hamiltonians @xmath33 and @xmath60 are exactly one - to - one identical except for the so - called intruder states .",
    "in such a way , the origin of pss deeply hidden in @xmath33 can be traced in its susy partner hamiltonian @xmath60 .",
    "furthermore , the perturbative nature of pss is demonstrated by the perturbation calculations , and the pss - breaking term can be regarded as a small perturbation on the exact pss limits , so that the special patterns of the pso splittings can be interpreted in a quantitative way .",
