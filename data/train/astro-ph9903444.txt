    "inverse compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) by hot electrons in the atmospheres of clusters of galaxies , the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect ( sunyaev and zeldovich 1980 ) , has become a powerful tool in astrophysics .",
    "it is one of the most important secondary effects which cause fluctuations in the cmbr .",
    "we will refer to the effect arising from static gas as the static sz ( ssz ) effect , and that arising from gas with bulk motion as the kinematic sz ( ksz ) effect .",
    "fluctuations in the cmbr caused by the sz effects in an ensemble of clusters of galaxies should dominate on angular scales less than few arc minutes .",
    "the nature of these fluctuations depends on the evolution of clusters , and so it is a test of structure formation theories ( eg . @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "observations of the ssz effect , begun in the 1970s , have now become routine in the 90s with dedicated instruments using the latest receiver technology ( for reviews see @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "sz effect and x - ray measurements probe the physical conditions in the intracluster gas in clusters of galaxies , and allow us to deduce the distance to the cluster without additional assumptions .",
    "this provides a useful independent method for determining the hubble constant .",
    "observations of the ksz effect are much more difficult since it is typically an order of magnitude smaller than the ssz effect and has the same spectrum as the primordial fluctuations in the cmbr .",
    "the ksz effect provides a method of measuring radial peculiar velocities of clusters , and even without the tangential velocity component , which might be determined using the rees - sciama ( rs ) effect ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) it should provide important information on large scale velocity fields , which are closely related to the large scale density distributions and thus to the average total mass density in the universe .",
    "useful limits on the size of the ksz effect for two clusters have recently been reported by holzapfel et al .",
    "( 1997a ) .",
    "most discussions of the ssz effect have been based on non - relativistic calculations of its amplitude , made via a fokker - planck type expansion of the boltzmann equation ( @xcite ) .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that in interesting cases ( electron temperature , @xmath1 , much greater than the temperature of the incoming radiation ) it provides a convenient analytical solution for the spectrum of the emerging radiation .",
    "however , it has been recognized recently that relativistic effects become important for clusters with @xmath2 kev .",
    "rephaeli ( 1995a ) provided a relativistic solution for the ssz effect as a series expansion in the optical depth ( @xmath3 for clusters ) .",
    "there is no exact analytical solution .",
    "the numerical integrals involved are tractable in the single - scattering approximation , which is usually adequate in clusters .",
    "fargion , konoplich and salis ( 1996 ) developed exact expressions for relativistic inverse compton scattering of a laser beam with monochromatic isotropic radiation , finding good agreement with the approximations of jones ( 1968 ) .",
    "their expression for the frequency redistribution function ( frdf ) for scattering of mono - energetic electrons with monochromatic photons agrees with rephaeli s result .",
    "rephaeli s method has been used in a series of papers to evaluate the ssz effect for hot clusters .",
    "relativistic corrections to the ssz effect , and to the standard thermal bremsstrahlung formulae , were applied to determine the hubble constant in hot clusters by rephaeli and yankovich ( 1997 ) , however , their corrections of the thermal bremsstrahlung equation were further corrected by hughes and birkinshaw ( 1998 ) .",
    "holzapfel et al .",
    "( 1997b ) used the relativistic results in their determination of the hubble constant from observations of cluster abell 2163 .",
    "the most general treatment of compton scattering in static and moving media has been derived by psaltis and lamb ( 1997 ) as a series expansion . as challinor and lasenby ( 1998b ) noted , however , more terms in the expansion",
    "should be taken into account for accurate treatment of clusters of galaxies .",
    "recently the kompaneets equation has been extended to contain relativistic corrections to the ssz and ksz effects ( @xcite ; @xcite , b ; itoh , kohyama and nozawa 1998 ; nozawa , itoh and kohyama 1998 ; @xcite ) .",
    "starting from the boltzmann equation , an expansion in the small parameters of the dimensionless temperature , @xmath4 , fractional energy change in a scattering , @xmath5 , and dimensionless radial velocity for the ksz effect , @xmath6 , leads to a fokker - planck type equation ( the extended kompaneets equation ) .",
    "corrections up to the fifth order in @xmath7 have been derived ( @xcite ) .",
    "these calculations demonstrate the importance of the relativistic effects ( in accordance with the results of rephaeli 1995a ) .",
    "note however , that , as challinor and lasenby ( 1998a ) emphasized , the extended kompaneets equation is a result of an asymptotic series expansion , therefore it is important to estimate the validity of the expansion using other methods .",
    "nozawa et al . compared the convergence of their expansion to a direct numerical evaluation of the boltzmann collision integral , and concluded that in the rayleigh - jeans region the relativistic corrections give accurate results in the entire range of cluster temperatures .",
    "significant deviations are found at higher frequencies for high temperature clusters .",
    "the ssz and ksz effects must be separated in order to extract information on peculiar velocities .",
    "fortunately the two effects have different frequency dependence .",
    "the maximum of the ksz effect ( in thermodynamic temperature units ) occurs at about the `` cross - over '' frequency where the ssz effect changes sign from being a decrement to an increment . in a non - relativistic treatment",
    "the cross - over frequency is a constant , 218 ghz , independent of electron temperature , optical depth , and all other parameters .",
    "rephaeli ( 1995a ) showed that in the relativistic case the cross - over frequency depends on the temperature , and his results were used by holzapfel et al .",
    "( 1997a ) in determining peculiar velocities of two clusters .",
    "sazonov and sunyaev ( 1998b ) and nozawa et al . (",
    "1998 ) give approximations for the cross - over frequency as a function of dimensionless temperature and radial peculiar velocity .",
    "they also conclude that relativistic corrections to the cross - over frequency are important , and should be taken into account in future experiments .",
    "other methods have been used to investigate inverse compton scattering , such as numerical integration of the collision integral ( @xcite ) , multiple scattering methods ( @xcite ) , and monte carlo simulations",
    ". simulations of inverse compton scattering in relativistic and non - relativistic plasma have been carried out for embedded sources ( pozdnyakov , sobol , and sunyaev 1983 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "gull and garret ( 1998 ) used monte carlo methods to evaluate the boltzmann collisional integral .",
    "sazonov and sunyaev ( 1998a ) used monte carlo simulations to derive the sz thermal and kinematic effects .    in this paper",
    "we study the effect of optical depth and non - uniform bulk motion on the sz effect using a monte carlo method to calculate the frequency redistribution function . the inverse compton scattering of cmbr photons is treated in the thomson limit for static and infalling plasmas ( ssz and ksz effects ) with spherical symmetry , uniform density distribution , and low optical depth over a wide range of gas temperatures and observed frequency .",
    "we apply our results to clusters of galaxies assuming a static and radially infalling ( or collapsing ) gas component .",
    "the emerging intensity of a beam of radiation in the line of sight after passage through a scattering atmosphere can be expressed as a convolution of the frdf and the incoming intensity :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the dimensionless frequency , @xmath10 is the incoming intensity ( hereafter assumed to be planckian ) , and @xmath11 is the frdf , which specifies the probability of scattering from @xmath12 to @xmath13 as a function of the logarithm of the dimensionless frequency , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 , @xmath13 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the planck constant , the frequency , the boltzmann constant , and the temperature of the cmbr , @xmath19 k ( @xcite ) . the frdf can be expressed as    @xmath20    where the first term containing the dirac delta function , @xmath21 , describes the attenuated incoming radiation by a factor depending on the line of sight optical depth , @xmath22 , the `` out - scattered '' radiation , and the second term describes the contribution from scattering into the beam , which depends on the frdf of the scattered radiation , @xmath23 , and a weight , @xmath24 , which determines what fraction of the radiation scatters into the beam .",
    "this decomposition is possible because in our approximation the fractional frequency change is independent of the frequency ( see equation  [ e : nu_nu ] later ) .",
    "the change of the intensity in the line of sight may be expressed as    @xmath25    for isotropic and homogeneous scattering conditions , so that the scattering parameters do not depend on where the scattering happens , the weight    @xmath26    which means that the out - scattered radiation is balanced by the same amount of in - scattered radiation , and so there would be no net intensity change ( @xmath27 ) if there were no frequency change ( @xmath23 is the dirac delta function ) .",
    "our task is to calculate @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "however , the assumption in equation  ( [ e : wtau_hom ] ) breaks down where the radiation field is not isotropic within the cloud , as will be the case in our static and collapsing models , or where there is relativistic bulk motion , which introduces anisotropy in the scattering via the relativistic beaming effect . in the cases which we discuss in the present paper ,",
    "equation  ( [ e : wtau_hom ] ) is an excellent approximation as we have been able to verify using the results of our monte carlo simulations ( see section  [ ss : mc_method ] ) .",
    "significant departures from equation  ( [ e : wtau_hom ] ) will occur where the scattering optical depth becomes large , or where the gas velocities approach the speed of light : the appropriate treatment in these cases is discussed in a forthcoming paper .",
    "our approximations are adequate for clusters of galaxies , thus we are going to assume the validity of equation  ( [ e : wtau_hom ] ) in the rest of this paper .",
    "we derive @xmath23 using a monte carlo method . at low optical depth ( @xmath28 )",
    ", the problem is suitable for monte carlo simulation because we do not have to follow photons through many scatterings in the medium ( the average number of scatterings being approximately @xmath22 ) .",
    "although in this limit most of the photons do not scatter , and hence provide no information on @xmath23 , this is not a problem since we can use the method of forced first scattering ( see below ) .",
    "we give a short description of the method here , for a more detailed description see molnar ( 1998 ) .",
    "we assume an isotropic incoming low temperature radiation field ( the cmbr ) .",
    "we use forced first scatterings to study the inverse compton process .",
    "the photons compton scatter from an electron population with a relativistic maxwellian distribution of momenta in the rest frame of bulk motion .",
    "we compute scattering probabilities in the rest frame of the electron in the thomson limit ( @xcite ) .",
    "this involves coordinate transformations from the observer s frame to the rest frame of the bulk motion and to the rest frame of the electron .",
    "we assume time translation invariance and spherical symmetry .",
    "time translational invariance is not exact for our model with infall , so that we make a snap - shot approximation .",
    "the error arising from this approximation is less than the light crossing time over the infall time ( @xmath29 ) , which is only a few per cent of the infall term for our models .    in most cases we use the inverse method to generate the desired probability distribution .",
    "we use a rejection method when the inverse method leads to non - invertible functions or is too slow : for a general description of generating probability distributions cf .",

    "( 1983 ) ; press et al .",
    "the former reference describes an alternative monte carlo method to treat inverse compton scattering .    in the description that follows we use the word `` photon '' in the singular to refer to one monte carlo `` photon '' , one experiment in our simulation .",
    "we use a weight , @xmath30 , to express the number of photons this one experiment represents ( the weight does not have to be an integer ) .",
    "we carried out the simulation in five steps .",

    "since we are using forced first collisions , we have to account for the fraction of photons which are unscattered on their path through the cloud",
    ". the scattered weight may be obtained from equation  ( [ e : wtau_hom ] ) : @xmath37 , and stays the same during subsequent ( unforced ) scatterings .",

    "the angular distribution of the scattered electrons in the plane perpendicular to the momentum vector of the photon is isotropic ( at azimuthal angle uniformly distributed between 0 and @xmath49 ) . in the rest frame of the electron ,",
    "the cosine of the polar angle of the incoming photon is derived from a lorentz transformation as    @xmath50    where the negative sign in front of @xmath45 is appropriate for an _ incoming _ photon . in the electron s rest frame the scattering probability of a photon coming in with direction cosine @xmath51 and leaving with direction cosine @xmath52",

    "we do not use forced scattering , so the optical depth follows from the usual ( inverse ) method as    @xmath58 , \\ ] ]    where the lower index on @xmath22 refers to the @xmath59th scattering ( @xmath60 ) , and we used @xmath33 = 1 - [ rn]$ ] , which is correct for uniform probability distributions .",
    "if @xmath22 is less than the maximum optical depth in the direction of the photon momentum after the previous scattering , @xmath61 , the photon is taken to have scattered within the cloud , and we calculate the new scattering direction and frequency of the scattered photon as in step 3 . if @xmath62 , the photon escaped ( scattered @xmath63 times ) , and we register the impact parameter ( the distance between the line of sight and the center of the spherically symmetric scattering medium ) , the weight of the photon , the number of scatterings and @xmath56 , the dimensionless frequency of the escaped photon .    at the end of the simulation",
    "we sum the weights in every impact parameter bin to check our assumption of homogeneous scattering ( equation  [ e : wtau_hom ] ) and we determine how the average number of scatterings depend on the impact parameter .",
    "it turns out that , in our case of low optical depth and very mild infall velocities , the average number of scatterings has no noticeable dependence on the impact parameter , and that equation  ( [ e : wtau_hom ] ) is satisfied at each impact parameter within the accuracy of our monte carlo simulations , which is less than 0.1 % .",
    "the scattered frdf depends only on the number of scatterings , thus we can sum all the photons to determine an average scattered frdf , which can be used as an excellent approximation to the frdf corresponding to an arbitrary line of sight .",
    "therefore the discrete probability distribution of the scattered frdf can be derived by binning the frequencies of all the out - coming photons as    @xmath64    @xmath65 is the number of photons in the k@xmath66 bin , for which @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the center of the k@xmath69 bin , @xmath70 is the width of the bin , and @xmath71 is the normalization , @xmath72 .",

    "this @xmath74 is our sampled approximation to @xmath23 , and we then fit an exponential of polynomials to @xmath74 to get a convenient expression for the frdf .",
    "our fit gives an approximation accurate to better than half a percent , except in the ( small ) extended tails , where @xmath23 is under - represented .",
    "however , these regions lie 3 orders of magnitude below the peak , and the error arising from the fit is negligible for our applications .",
    "we tested our code by comparing our single scattering monte carlo results for the frdf ( @xmath75 ) to those derived from rephaeli ( 1995a ) .",
    "rephaeli s single - scattering approximation can be written as    @xmath76    where the lower limit @xmath77 is the minimum @xmath44 needed to get the frequency shift @xmath56 ,    @xmath78    the functions @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 are    @xmath82    where @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 are defined by    @xmath87    and we used equation  ( [ e : nu_nu ] ) to eliminate @xmath88 .",

    "deviations from the itoh et al.s result are already appearing at @xmath99 , and become more pronounced at higher temperatures and high frequencies , as we would expect .",
    "we conclude that our simulation method passes these two tests , and can now be used to calculate the effects of multiple scattering and bulk velocity on the sz effect .",

    "we estimate the amplitudes of these effects on the hot cluster , abell 2163 , which was discussed by holzapfel et al .",

    "the maximum optical depth of the cluster is @xmath146 , the temperature of the intracluster gas is close to @xmath99 . using our results for the static effect with the given temperature and maximum optical depth we get about 100 mhz shift to higher frequencies relative to the linear expression of challinor and lasenby ( 1998a ) .",
    "an infall velocity of @xmath147 causes about an additional 15 mhz shift to higher frequencies relative to our result for the static model .",
    "these shifts are small relative to the 20 ghz band width of the instrument of holzapfel et al .",
    "( 1997a ) and the error in @xmath148 and cluster radial peculiar velocity from ignoring their presence would be about 10 % ( if the sz effect is measured at @xmath149 ) and 15 @xmath142 .",
    "by comparison , the component of primordial anisotropy in this scale corresponds to adding a velocity noise about @xmath150 @xmath142 .",
    "we investigated the effect of finite optical depth and bulk motion on inverse compton scatterings in spherically symmetric uniform density mildly relativistic plasma .",
    "we assumed isotropic incoming radiation ( cmbr ) , a relativistic maxwellian distribution for the electron momenta , and scatterings in the thomson limit .",
    "we demonstrated the usefulness of our monte carlo method for solving the radiative transfer problem , and calculated the static and kinematic sz effects with different optical depth and gas infall velocities .",
    "the solution of the extended kompaneets equation ( with corrections up to the fifth order ) is equivalent to a single - scattering approximation , and significant deviations from it occur for hot clusters and at high frequencies",
    ". these deviations may be as large as 5 % of the intensity change and neglecting them could cause about a 10 % error in the hubble constant .",
    "a finite optical depth causes further small changes in the sz effect : these changes may exceed the relativistic correction terms . for typical cluster temperatures ,",
    "an accurate expression for the cross - over frequency as a function of temperature , optical depth , and bulk motion is ( [ e : x0_gl ] ) .",
    "as it can seen from figure  [ f : x0_glgx ] , the cross - over frequency is sensitive to the cluster radial velocity , and less sensitive to the finite optical depth .",
    "measurements of the cross - over frequency can , in principle , be used to determine the radial velocity of the cluster ( e.g. , as in @xcite ) , with small extra corrections for optical depth and possible gas motion inside the cluster .",
    "however , the relatively strong variation of @xmath151 with @xmath7 , compared to @xmath22 or @xmath114 , suggests that the largest uncertainty will arise from the assumption of cluster isothermality , even if effects of confusion from primordial ( and secondary ) cmbr fluctuations can be excluded .",
    "finally we note that our method can be extended to any geometry , density distribution and complicated bulk motion as desired , and may be used to study the sz effect in high temperature plasmas with or without bulk motion .",
