    "one of the simplest non - stringy example of ads / cft correspondence @xcite is the duality between vector type models and higher spin gravity in one higher dimension @xcite .",
    "these dualities are presently a topic of fruitful studies @xcite .",
    "higher spin theories have a long history @xcite .",
    "interacting theories of all spins containing gravity were successfully constructed through a gauge principle @xcite .",
    "a construction of higher spin / vector model duality based on collective fields was proposed in @xcite .",
    "a one - to - one map was explicitly given in @xcite in the light - cone gauge @xcite ( where hs gravity is the simplest ) .",
    "a similar identification of ads space in light - cone qcd was developed in @xcite .",
    "a renormalization group method for bi - local observables is being developed in @xcite .",
    "the collective method is easily formulated in any time - like frame , and it has been employed explicitly in @xcite . a covariant version is also possible with a more general first principle understanding of the duality @xcite .",
    "this concrete ads / cft duality provides insight and allows constructions and studies of issues which otherwise are fairly difficult in hs gravity and string theory .",
    "one such issue is the procedure for quantization of the theory . in higher spin gravity ,",
    "vasiliev s equations of motion are known explicitly but the canonical description of the equation has been only started in @xcite . in string theory , this has not been possible at all except in very low dimension .    on the other hand",
    "the collective construction naturally contains a canonical picture which , through duality , also gives the canonical picture of higher spin gravity .",
    "for that reason , in this paper we discuss in detail the canonical structure brought in by the collective / hs gravity identification .",
    "this concerns the form of bulk higher spin fields and observables , their exact commutation relations and ads locality .",
    "these will be established systematically in the remainder of this paper .",
    "finally we stress that the present work deals with the canonical construction in a time - like gauge of the theory .",
    "this gauge is appropriate for hamiltonian description and is central to the unitarity of the theory .",
    "it is of definite interest to have the bi - local map formulated in the covariant gauge framework also .",
    "some elements of to map to covariant ( fronsdal type ) gauges were recently given in a separate work @xcite .",
    "this construction uses the world line spinning particle framework and as such could be related to the bi - local higher spin holographic construction of @xcite given in terms spinor variables .",
    "this connection is currently being considered .",
    "the basis of the ads / cft lies in the different manifestation of the theory when expanded perturbatively vs when seen through the large @xmath2 expansion .",

    "here we assumed the scalar field interaction @xmath18 to be at most quartic in @xmath19 , otherwise there is an additional interaction term generated from @xmath18 . to summarize , the two main properties of the collective representation are :    a.   the representation features @xmath1 as a coupling constant , leading to a natural witten type expansion .",
    "b.   collective fields are exactly canonical , through the commutation relations ( [ col commutation rel ] ) .",
    "this property follows from the definition of the conjugate field @xmath20 . for the bi - local case we therefore have @xmath21=\\delta(x_1-x_1')\\delta(x_2-x_2')+\\delta(x_1-x_2')\\delta(x_2-x_1')\\ ] ] for all order in @xmath1 .",
    "the only nontrivial issue with respect to exact duality is the interpretation of the ` collective space ' @xmath6 .",
    "this represents a kinematical problem .",
    "when interpreted in physical terms , the collective space leads to extra emerging coordinates ( as in @xcite ) and emerging gravitational and string degrees of freedom ( @xcite ) . in some relatively simple cases , this ` de - coding ' of collective degrees can be completely done .",
    "such is the case of @xmath2-component vector theories with dual higher spin fields and ads@xmath22 . for these one",
    "has a one - to - one map between bi - local ( collective ) degrees of freedom and higher spin fields in ads space - time .",
    "the simplest form of the map is found in light - cone quantization where it is given explicitly for ads@xmath0/cft@xmath23 in @xcite .",
    "we give a short summary of the light - cone case since the construction in any other frame will be related . denoting a sequence of higher spin fields by @xmath24 , a fourier transformation with respect to spin",
    "@xmath25 leads to @xmath26 representing a field on ads@xmath27 .",
    "it was established by metsaev that a representation @xcite of @xmath28 with all spins can be built on this space - time . to construct a one - to - one map between bi - local and bulk fields , one first builds a transformation @xcite from bi - local momentum space to the momentum space ,",

    "consequently , this map between fields is one - to - one and invertible .",
    "the coordinate space map can be determined from this kernel through the the chain rule .",
    "in particular , @xmath34 establishes the following identification between the extra ads@xmath0 coordinate and the relative bi - local space : @xmath35 by construction , the transformations between coordinates / momenta corresponds to a canonical transformation .",
    "this fact has a number of consequences .",
    "one can show that the @xmath28 generators of ads@xmath0 higher spin fields @xcite correspond to those of the bi - local cft@xmath23 @xcite , namely : @xmath36 for any generator of @xmath28 .",
    "furthermore , the canonical commutators of collective fields are seen to imply canonical commutation relations in the constructed ads@xmath0 space .",
    "canonical quantization of scalar field in light - cone time introduces the notation @xmath37 which is fourier transformed with respect to @xmath38 . for @xmath39 , @xmath37 and its conjugate",
    "@xmath40 plays a role of creation operator and annihilation operator , respectively .",
    "we define bi - local field to be @xmath41 and , one can represent its conjugate as @xmath42 using chain rule , one can easily express @xmath43 in terms of @xmath44 and its conjugate @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath46 up to contact terms and where we used compact notation , @xmath47 .",
    "note that the contact terms in ( [ eq : psidag ] ) appear because one has to take independent collective fields @xmath48 into account when using chain rule .",

    "equations of motion and time evolution of the dual theory will be dictated by those of bi - local collective fields @xmath48 .",
    "they are given to all orders in @xmath1 by the hamiltonian in ( [ hamiltonian expansion ] ) .",
    "in leading expansion , the ( linearized ) equations for the bi - local field read : @xmath59 coming from the leading term in the @xmath1 expansion of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian expansion ] ) .",
    "this gives the time evolution : @xmath60 and after the momentum space map , the following leading time evolution for the higher spin field @xmath61 : @xmath62 and the associated linearized equation of motion : @xmath63 agree with the higher spin equations of metsaev @xcite .",
    "let us now come to another relevant property of this bulk construction , which is the behavior of the constructed ads fields near the @xmath64 boundary .",
    "for this , we can proceed to be on - shell and in linearized approximation , and consider the map for the spin @xmath25 field in particular : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is jacobian of the transformation in ( [ light - cone transformation1])@xmath67([light - cone transformation4 ] ) and @xmath68 is jacobi polynomial .",
    "we also note that when put on - shell through linearized approximation the map produces the low spin formulae of @xcite .    using the symmetry of the collective bi - local field @xmath69 which corresponds to a symmetry of the higher spin field @xmath70 by the kernel @xmath32 and performing a change of variables from @xmath71 to @xmath72 ( coming from the delta function ) , one obtains , after short calculation , the relation : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is recognized to represent fourier modes of spin-@xmath25 primary operators @xmath75 of the @xmath7 model @xcite which in terms of the bi - local collective read : @xmath76 now one registers the following boundary behavior of @xmath77 : @xmath78 the fact that the collective field map to ads fields leads , at @xmath64 , to the conserved primary operators of the cft is a clear verification of the above bulk construction .",
    "this represents a significant consistency check .",
    "we can follow the basics of the light - cone construction and give an analogous construction in any other frame . here",
    "we give the details of quantization performed in the time - like frame .",
    "some parts of this construction have appeared before , while some parallel the light - cone case . nevertheless , the full construction is sufficiently nontrivial so that we find it worthwhile to present it .",
    "regarding the change of ( phase space ) coordinates from bi - local to ads , first it is natural to identify the center of momentum of the bi - local space with the momentum of ads@xmath0 space . @xmath79",
    "second , based on light - cone case , we can make use of the same `` on - shell '' condition adopted for time - like kinematics .",
    "this gives the following identification of @xmath71 with bi - local momenta : @xmath80 where @xmath81 there is an ambiguity in choosing the sign of @xmath71 .",
    "we determined @xmath71 in a way that the sign of @xmath71 is changed when one exchanges @xmath82 and @xmath83 . also , note that @xmath84 .",
    "next , for further identification it is useful to use the second - order casimir which , for the unitary irreducible representations @xmath85 of @xmath28 , equals : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the lowest energy and @xmath25 is the spin .",

    "now , we will obtain the detailed form of the physical primary operators @xmath194 and @xmath194 .",
    "useful expressions for primary currents of the free @xmath7 vector model were given in @xcite .",

    "in fact , one can naturally derive the identification of @xmath93 from the primary operator in this way . in the similar way . ]",
    "in this paper , we have summarized ( and elaborated further on ) the canonical properties of the collective field construction of vector model / higher spin duality . in particular , in time - like quantization a map between bi - local collective fields and higher spin fields is established first . as we have explained here , one has the gauge reduced canonical higher spin fields which for all spins are summarized as a scalar field on ads@xmath254 , a space on which a massless representation of @xmath28 can be specified .",
    "it is then demonstrated that the map implies canonical commutation relations for the constructed ads fields .",
    "these relations are exact to all orders in @xmath1 and are seen to follow from the canonical property of the collective fields .",

    "one also encounters another issue which comes under the name of the ` finite @xmath2 exclusion ' @xcite . in the collective approach , this represents the fact that the collective field variables represent an overcomplete set at finite @xmath2 .",
