    "semiconductor superlattices ( ssl ) have attracted growing attention in view of their unique electronic properties , which can be used for generation , amplification and detection of a high - frequency electromagnetic radiation @xcite .",
    "nonlinear transport properties of ssl allows a generation of thz radiation in conditions of negative differential conductance ( ndc ) @xcite .",
    "however , the static ndc makes ssl unstable against formation of high - field electric domains @xcite .",
    "these electric domains are believed to be destructive for the thz gain in ssls .",
    "currently the main focus is on the possibilities to overcome this drawback within the scheme of dc - biased ssl @xcite .",
    "however , schemes of thz superlatice devices with ac pump fields are also under discussion @xcite .",
    "a strong microwave field @xmath0 pumps the ssl and a desirable signal field @xmath1 has a higher frequency @xmath2 .",
    "because for typical ssls the characteristic scattering time @xmath3 at room temperature is of the order of @xmath4 fs , an interaction of the microwave fields with the miniband electrons is quasistatic ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "importantly , we have showed recently that such quasistatic pump field can completely suppress domains in ssls @xcite .",
    "two distinct possibilities exist for the signal field : it can be also quasistatic ( @xmath6 ) or it can not be described within the quasistatic approach if @xmath7 . the later situation , i.e. @xmath5 but",
    "@xmath8 , can be called _",
    "semiquasistatic interaction_. thus , the semiquasistatic approach is introduced to describe an amplification of thz field in ssl under the action of microwave field .",
    "our main findings are following .",
    "we consider the response of miniband electrons to an action of the total electric field @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the dc bias and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) is the weak signal ( probe ) field . in the real devices",
    "@xmath14 is a mode of the resonator tuned to a desirable thz frequency .",
    "we define the dimensionless absorption of the weak ac probe field in ssl as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the miniband electron velocity defined in the units of the maximal miniband velocity , averaging @xmath17 is performed over time . starting from the exact formal solution of the boltzmann transport equation",
    ", we represent the absorption @xmath18 as a sum of three terms @xcite @xmath19 here @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 describe the absorption ( gain ) seeded by generation of harmonics , the parametric amplification of the probe field due to a coherent interaction of the pump and the probe fields , and the nonparametric absorption , correspondingly .",
    "the derivation of semiquasistatic formulas is based on the use of the asymptotic saddle - point method .    using this method we have get the following results .",
    "the term @xmath20 is just the expression for @xmath23th in - phase harmonic of the time - dependent current through ssl @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the dc voltage , @xmath26 is the length of ssl ( @xmath27 is the period of ssl and @xmath28 is the number spatial periods ) , @xmath29 is the amplitude of ac voltage created by the pump field across ssl , the current @xmath30 is normalized to the maximal current in ssl , @xmath31 , corresponding to the maximal miniband velocity .",
    "note that @xmath20 gives the main contribution to the absorption of a weak probe @xcite .",
    "the expression for @xmath20 is not specific for the semiquasistic limit because of its independence on @xmath32 .",
    "however , _ our main finding is that the absorption components @xmath21 and @xmath22 can be represented within semiquasistatic approach using the specific terms of quantum derivatives as _",
    "@xmath34 where @xmath35 is the amplitude of small - signal voltage and @xmath36 is the esaki - tsu voltage - current ( ui ) characteristic ( @xmath37 is the critical voltage and @xmath38 is normalized to the maximal current @xmath39 ) .",
    "importantly , following eq .",
    "( [ inc ] ) in order to find the incoherent absorption in ssl at arbitrary high frequency @xmath32 we need to know only @xmath40 that is , _ the time - averaged current induced by the quasistatic field ( voltage)_. for a given amplitude of ac voltage @xmath41 , the dc current @xmath42 is a function of only dc bias @xmath43 .",
    "it is easy to calculate or to measure the modifications of ui characteristic caused by the action of microwave ( quasistatic ) field @xcite .",
    "note that in the quasistatic case @xmath22 goes into a usual derivative of current .",
    "the difference between these derivatives is shown on the figure  [ fig:1 ] where the dashed line is a derivative of dc current and the dotted line is a quantum derivative depended on the number of harmonic @xmath23 .",
    "the importance of finding of @xmath22 is stipulated by the following fact : @xmath22 plays an essential role in the stabilization of space - charge instability in ssl .",
    "we need to know @xmath22 to determine the conditions of space - charge instabilities .",
    "it is surprise that we can determine it only measuring the dc current as a function a dc bias . using only a finite difference we can select the working point of a generator that is optimal for its stability .",
    "note that @xmath44 in the quasistatic case and the system is stable against small fluctuations of internal field .    on the other hand , following eq .",
    "( [ coh ] ) finding of the coherent component of absorption at the high frequency corresponding to @xmath23th harmonic of the pump frequency ( @xmath12 ) is reduced to _ the calculation of @xmath45th harmonic of the current within quasistatic approach_. that is , one needs to know @xmath46 ( note that in comparison with ( [ harm - gen ] ) we have in ( [ harm - vm ] ) : @xmath47 ) . in analogy with @xmath22 , the coherent absorption @xmath21 can be found if we know only the dependence on dc bias .",
    "@xmath21 is proportional to the quantum derivative of @xmath20 in the semiquasistatic case , and @xmath21 goes into a common derivative in the quasistatic case .",
    "these derivatives are shown in the figure  [ fig:2 ] ( @xmath48 ) ) for the case of 7 harmonic .    to the best of our knowledge",
    "this paper is the first work , where the quantum derivatives naturally appeared in a description of microstructure s response to a bichromatic field .",
    "it is the exciting problem to understand whether our semiquasistatic approach , developed for superlattices operating in the miniband transport regime , can be generalized to other tunnelling structure .",
