    "ever since the detection of the first millisecond pulsar ( backer et al .",
    "1982 ) it has been clear that a ms - pulsar is a neutron star ( ns ) which has been spun up by accretion in a close binary system ( for a review see bhattacharya & van den heuvel 1991 ) .",
    "because the amount of mass needed to spin up a ns to ms periods is rather small , i.e. @xmath5 ( burderi et al . 1999 ) and the mass available from the donor is typically many times larger , i.e. typically of order @xmath6 , it appeared as if there was no problem spinning up a ns to such short periods .",
    "yet in recent years , evidence has accumulated which shows that ns are inefficient accretors .",
    "thorsett & chakrabarty ( 1999 ) noted that in all cases where the mass of a ns could be measured _ with precision _ it turned out to be in the very narrow interval @xmath7 . even if one makes the extreme assumption that all nss are born with exactly the same mass , this would imply that none of these nss could have accreted more than @xmath8 , despite the fact that some of these nss have been spun up by accretion and the mass available from the donor star was probably much larger than @xmath8 . in another context , king & ritter ( 1999 )",
    "have presented further evidence that nss can be very inefficient accretors .",
    "the main reason for this low accretion efficiency is the frequent disparity between the mass transfer rate provided by the donor star and the maximum rate at which the ns can accrete .",
    "the latter is approximately the eddington rate @xmath9 , whereas , depending on circumstances , the former can be larger by many orders of magnitude .",
    "one of the obvious places in which nss can be spun up to ms ",
    "pulsars are wide binaries in which a ns accretes from a giant .",
    "tauris & savonije ( 1999 ) have recently devoted a detailed study to this formation channel .",
    "one of their predictions is that , in principle , ms ",
    "pulsars should form in binaries with final orbital periods of up to @xmath10 , even when taking into account that the mass transfer rate in long  period systems ( @xmath11 ) exceeds the eddington accretion rate .",
    "in addition , their calculations predict a correlation between the final orbital period and the mass of the ms  pulsar .",
    "unfortunately , this can not be tested at present .",
    "but their first prediction can . and here",
    "observations show , contrary to their prediction , that there are no ms  pulsars in wide binaries with a circular orbit and a period @xmath12 ( see e.g. table 1 in taam , king & ritter 2000 ) . in this context ,",
    "li & wang ( 1998 ) have already noted that the accretion efficiency of the ns in such a binary is far lower than has been assumed by tauris & savonije ( 1999 ) if one takes into account the fact that in all these wide binaries the accretion disc around the ns is thermally unstable and accretion is transient ( king et al .",
    "this is because a ) during an outburst the mass flow rate through the disc is much larger than the mass transfer rate from the donor , which , in turn , is already super ",
    "eddington if @xmath11 , and b ) because a ns can not accrete in excess of the eddington rate .",
    "in fact , li & wang ( 1998 ) found that if the duty cycle of the disc instability limit cycle is @xmath13 then in systems with a final orbital period @xmath14 the total mass accreted by the ns is @xmath15 few @xmath16 , too little to spin up a ns to ms periods .",
    "in this paper we elaborate on the idea of li & wang ( 1998 ) and derive explicit expressions for the duty cycle and the accretion efficiency of the ns in terms of the parameters of the binary system and the outburst cycle .",
    "our calculations show that if the duration of the quiescent phase between two subsequent outbursts exceeds a few decades , the accretion efficiency becomes so small that in binaries with a final orbital period @xmath17 , the ns can not accrete enough mass to become a ms pulsar .",
    "the binary systems for which we wish to decribe the accretion processes are wide , long  period binaries with orbital periods of typically @xmath11 and in which a neutron star primary of mass @xmath18 accretes from a giant secondary , of mass @xmath19 .",
    "the basic model ingredients we use can be summarized as follows :      we assume that mass transfer from the secondary is thermally ( and adiabatically ) stable . in this case",
    ", the mass transfer rate can be computed from a simple analytical approximation ( e.g. ritter 1999 ) . following king et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and using the same model parameters we can write for the mass transfer rate    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the orbital period in days , @xmath22 the thermal equilibrium mass  radius exponent of the donor star , and @xmath23 the mass  radius exponent of the donor s critical roche radius . for ( thermal ) stability",
    "we require @xmath24 ( e.g. ritter 1988 ) .",
    "accretion on to a compact star can result in significant external irradiation of the accretion disc by the central accretion source ( e.g. van paradijs 1996 ) . here",
    "we follow king & ritter ( 1998 ) and assume that the effective temperature of the disc is kept above the hydrogen ionization temperature @xmath25 by irradiation from the central accretion source out to a radius    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the central accretion rate , and , for a neutron star accretor , @xmath28 cgs ( king & ritter 1998 ) .",
    "furthermore , we shall assume that the neutron star can not accrete in excess of the eddington accretion rate @xmath29 , i.e. that @xmath30 .",
    "this means that the maximum radius out to which the disc can be kept hot by irradiation , i.e. at @xmath31 , is    @xmath32    here @xmath33 and @xmath34 cgs . at the same time",
    "our assumption that @xmath35 means that whenever the mass flow rate through the disc is @xmath36 , the excess matter must be ejected from the disc .      for describing the properties of the accretion disc around the neutron star we use the shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) @xmath1disc model .",
    "accordingly , if the vertical temperature stratification of the disc is dominated by viscous heating , the disc viscosity is ( e.g. frank , king & raine 1992 )    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the mass flow rate through the disc , @xmath39 the disc radius , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath1 is the viscosity parameter , here assumed to be constant with radius .",
    "\\(4 ) holds only to the extent that the vertical temperature stratification in the disc is dominated by viscous heating , hence its dependence on @xmath42 .",
    "if , on the other hand , the disc is strongly heated by external irradiation , the vertical temperature profile becomes nearly isothermal at the irradiation temperature @xmath43 .",
    "taking this into account in the @xmath1viscosity ansatz we find ( see also king 1998 )    @xmath44    here @xmath45 is the gas constant and @xmath46 the mean molecular weight .",
    "the maximum suface density which a disc can reach in the cool state , i.e. before it becomes thermally unstable and must turn into the hot state , is conventionally denoted by @xmath47 .",
    "taking @xmath47 from computations of ludwig , meyer ",
    "hofmeister & ritter ( 1995 ) , the mass accumulated before an outburst sets in can be written as    @xmath48    here @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the outer radius of those parts of the disc which are involved in the outburst , @xmath51 the @xmath1parameter in the cool state , and @xmath52 is the filling factor defined by this equation .",
    "@xmath53 takes into acount that a the onset of an outburst @xmath54 at only one point in the disc and that @xmath55 elsewhere .",
    "we shall assume that the disc instability limit cycle in these wide , long  period binary systems with a neutron star accretor can be described as follows :    a ) : :    during an outburst the disc is kept in the hot state by irradiation    out to the radius @xmath56 given by ( 2 ) .    because    @xmath57 .    if the physical outer radius of the disc    @xmath58 , only the inner part    with radius @xmath59 is hot ,    whereas the outer part with    @xmath60 remains in the    cold state ( e.g. king & ritter 1998 ) .",
    "hereafter we shall call    @xmath61 the radius of the `` active '' disc .",
    "if , on the    other hand ,    @xmath62 . if the mass flow rate through the outer parts of the active    disc is @xmath63 ,    then as long as    @xmath64 and    @xmath65 =    const .",
    "b ) : :    during an outburst the active part of the disc ( out to    @xmath50 ) is essentially emptied , i.e. the mass    remaining in the active part of the disc immediately after an outburst    is insignificant compared to the mass @xmath66 given by    ( 6 ) immediately before the onset of an outburst .",
    "c ) : :    during quiescence the mass of the active part of disc which was    accreted/ ejected during the previous outburst is replenished at the    mass transfer rate @xmath67 .",
    "this is tantamount to    assuming that if an inactive outer part of the disc exists , i.e if    @xmath68 , this outer part is    stationary , i.e. that @xmath69    for all @xmath70 .",
    "d ) : :    we assume that the hot part of the disc ( during an outburst ) is    characterized by a viscosity parameter @xmath71 ,    whereas in the cool state ( i.e. in the active part during quiescence    and in the inactive part ) the viscosity parameter is    @xmath72 .",
    "here we are mainly interested in systems which end their nuclear time scale  driven mass transfer at very long orbital periods , i.e. @xmath73 . with the analytical solution ( ritter 1999 )",
    "one can show that the corresponding initial periods at which stable mass transfer must have started are typically @xmath74 , ( the precise value depending on whether mass transfer is conservative or not , cf .",
    "taam et al .",
    "it has been shown by king et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and li & wang ( 1999 ) that at such long periods the mass transfer rate provided by nuclear evolution of the donor is always too small for stable disc accretion , i.e. the systems in question are transient , going through a disc instability limit cycle .",
    "in addition , the orbital period at which @xmath75 ( with @xmath76 for longer periods ) is    @xmath77    where @xmath78 is the critical roche radius of the primary .",
    "thus , for practically all systems in question we also have @xmath58 .",
    "as we shall argue below , during most of an outburst the mass flow rate through the outer parts of the active disc is highly super  eddington in the sense that @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , at least initially , in these systems @xmath80 = const .",
    "now , if the viscosity at @xmath81 does not depend on @xmath42 , and @xmath50 itself is constant , both the mass and the mass flow rate through the outer parts of the active disc decay exponentially on the viscous time scale    @xmath82    at the outer radius of the active disc .",
    "if initially @xmath83 , we have @xmath84 as long as @xmath85 and the disc is essentially emptied during the super  eddington phase which lasts for a time    @xmath86.\\ ] ]    this is the behaviour to be expected if the active part of the disc is dominated by irradiation , i.e. if @xmath87 is given by ( 5 ) .",
    "if , on the other hand , viscous heating still dominates the vertical temperature structure , @xmath87 is given by ( 4 ) .",
    "using ( 4 ) in ( 8) we see that @xmath88 , i.e. that the mass flow rate and the mass in the active part of the disc do not decay exponentially but rather as    @xmath89^{-3/7},\\ ] ]    where    @xmath90    is the time scale on which the disc mass decays initially .",
    "if , initially , @xmath91 , the disc is essentially emptied during the super  eddington phase which lasts in this case for the time    @xmath92    where    @xmath93^{3/10}\\ ] ]    is the time scale on which the disc mass decreases once @xmath94 reaches @xmath95 .",
    "the duration of the quiescent phase is given by the time it takes to replenish the matter which has been lost ( accreted / ejected ) from the active part of the disc during the previous outburst .",
    "because we have assumed that the active disc is fed at the rate @xmath96 , irrespective of whether @xmath97 is larger or smaller than @xmath98 , the duration of quiescence is    @xmath99    the total length of an outburst cycle is then    @xmath100    and the duty cycle of the outbursts    @xmath101    to decide the question of how much the neutron star can accrete , the quantity we need is the accretion efficiency @xmath3 . because the mass accreted over one cycle is @xmath102 , whereas the mass transferred over the same time is @xmath103 , we have    @xmath104    writing    @xmath105    we obtain    @xmath106    if the mass flow rate decays exponentially , i.e. if ( 5 ) is used , and    @xmath107    if ( 4 ) , i.e. ( 10 ) holds . in both cases ,",
    "it is immediately seen that @xmath3 is small if @xmath108 , i.e. if during the initial phases of an outburst the mass flow rate is highly super  eddington .",
    "in order to get @xmath3 , we need to know @xmath109 , i.e. @xmath110 . assuming again that @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and using ( 2 ) , ( 5 ) , ( 6 ) and ( 8) we find    @xmath113    we note that @xmath114 as given in ( 21 ) , and therefore also @xmath3 , still depends on the orbital period .",
    "the dependence on @xmath115 enters in a subtle way via the filling factor @xmath116 which itself must be a function of @xmath117 and hence via ( 1 ) of @xmath115 .",
    "unfortunately , this dependence is not explicitly known and can only be determined from full time ",
    "dependent calculations of the disc evolution .    replacing @xmath118 in ( 21 ) by means of ( 6 ) , noting that    @xmath119    we get rid of the poorly known quantities @xmath51 and @xmath116 at the price of introducing @xmath120 .",
    "this yields    @xmath121    inserting typical values in ( 23 ) , i.e @xmath122 we find @xmath123 at @xmath124 and @xmath125 at @xmath126 .",
    "this shows that if the quiescent time of these discs is long , i.e. @xmath127 a few decades , the accretion efficiency becomes very small .",
    "unfortunately , we do not have any direct observational information about @xmath120",
    ". however the analogy with the properties of the outbursts in black hole soft x  ray transients ( bhsxts ) ( see e.g. king & ritter 1998 ) suggests that the quiescent times are likely to be very long , i.e. longer than several decades . in the discussion below we show that the absence of any observed outbursts from the progenitors of pulsars in wide circular binaries supports this conclusion .",
    "we note in passing that @xmath128 must not be too large if this picture is to be self ",
    "consistent : the assumption that @xmath129 is dominated by external irradiation , i.e. that we may use ( 5 ) , requires that    @xmath130    if instead of ( 5 ) we use ( 4 ) , i.e. a viscosity where the disc temperature is self  consistently determined by viscous dissipation , we obtain :    @xmath131    inserting the same typical values as above in ( 25 ) we obtain @xmath132 at @xmath124 and @xmath133 at @xmath126 . from this",
    "it is seen that if only @xmath134few yr , disc accretion becomes even more inefficient if the viscosity is due to viscous dissipation rather than external irradiation .",
    "we also note that even if ( 24 ) is violated initially , the disc s evolution will eventually be dominated by external heating because @xmath135 decreases with time .",
    "finally , in the case of irradiation  dominated viscosity ( 5 ) the duty cycle becomes    @xmath136    although at a first glance @xmath2 does not seem to depend on @xmath115 it nevertheless does : besides a weak dependence on @xmath115 via @xmath137 there is a significant one from the factor @xmath138 .",
    "on the one hand @xmath117 depends explicitly on @xmath115 ( cf ( 1 ) ) , on the other hand a more subtle dependence which we have mentioned already earlier enters via the filling factor @xmath116 in ( 6 ) .",
    "nevertheless , if typical parameters are used in ( 26 ) , i.e. @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 , we have @xmath142 . therefore , if @xmath143 many decades , @xmath144 .",
    "li & wang ( 1998 ) have shown that the accretion efficiency of neutron stars which accrete from a giant is very small and , in fact , becomes too small for spinning up the neutron star to millisecond spin periods in systems with a final orbital period @xmath14 if the duty cycle @xmath13 . here",
    "we have worked out explicit expressions for @xmath2 and the accretion efficiency @xmath3 in terms of the binary parameters and the quiescent time @xmath120 of the outburst cycle in the framework of an irradiated @xmath1disc model .",
    "our calculations show that both , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are small if @xmath145 and the mass flow rate at the onset of an outburst is highly super  eddington .",
    "whether or not @xmath2 and @xmath3 are really small enough to prevent neutron stars in systems with @xmath146 being spun up to ms ",
    "periods depends crucially on the duration of quiescence @xmath120 .",
    "if @xmath147 many decades , as some observations of bhsxts suggest , then both @xmath3 and @xmath2 are very small indeed . unfortunately",
    ", determining @xmath120 in the framework of our simple model is not possible . for this fully time ",
    "dependent calculations of the disc instability limit cycle would be needed",
    ".    however there is another way that we can get a lower limit on @xmath2 .",
    "we know that pulsars in wide circular binaries must have descended from sxts .",
    "yet we do not know of a single transient with a period longer than 11.8@xmath148 ( gro j174428 ) , even though x  ray satellites would probably have detected an outburst from such a system anywhere in the galaxy within the last @xmath149  yr .",
    "this must mean that outbursts are rather infrequent , i.e. @xmath120 is long .",
    "we can make this more precise by defining the following quantities :    let @xmath150 be the frequency of x  ray outbursts from all systems in the galaxy , @xmath151 the currently known number of the pulsar binaries in question , @xmath152 the current number of the pulsar binaries in question in the galaxy , @xmath153 the lifetime of a progenitor system in the phase of nuclear time scale mass transfer , and @xmath154 the lifetime of the pulsar in the pulsar binaries in question .",
    "here @xmath153 and @xmath154 are suitable averages over the relevant population .",
    "now , the inventory of the binary pulsars in question is incomplete because of flux limitation , dispersion and beaming , whereas an x  ray outburst in one of the progenitor systems would probably be seen wherever in the galaxy the outburst occurs .",
    "we correct for this incompletness by introducing a ` filling factor ' @xmath155 . in a stationary situation",
    "we then must have    @xmath156    @xmath154 must be of the order of the spin - down time scale @xmath157 , @xmath153 , on the other hand , is of the order of the nuclear time scale @xmath158 defined in ritter ( 1999 , eq .",
    "14 ) which , for the systems in question , i.e. those which end their evolution with a long orbital period @xmath159 , is of the order @xmath160 . with @xmath161 ( i.e. psr b0820 + 02 and psr j1803 - 2712 ) , @xmath162 and from the fact that we have not seen a single outburst in the past 30  yr this yields the lower limit @xmath163 .",
    "we would also like to emphasize that we have adopted a very conservative value for @xmath164 .",
    "the real value is likely to be smaller still and thus the estimate for @xmath120 even larger because already the canonical beaming factor for pulsars is of order @xmath165 .",
    "thus it is very likely that the lack of ms  pulsars in binaries with white dwarf companions and @xmath159 is entirely a consequence of dwarf nova  like disc instabilities in long  period binaries .",
    "finally , we note that spinning up a ns in a long  period binary faces yet another obstacle : during the long quiescent phases the ns acts as a propeller ( illarionov & sunyaev 1975 ) and thereby is spun _ down _ , making the spin - up to ms spin periods even more difficult .",
