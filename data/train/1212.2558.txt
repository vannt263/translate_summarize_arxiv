    "the scheme is based upon the resonant interaction of three rydberg atoms initially prepared in a coherent superposition state traversing through a single - mode microwave cavity . as compared to the flying qubits , here we have considered stationary qubits defined through two lowest level of four level squids .",
    "our scheme is based on the generation and absorption of single photon in high q cavity using squids .",
    "the generation of single microwave photon in superconducting qubit have been reported , experimentally in some recent studies _",
    "et al_. @xcite .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have proposed a scheme for the realization of three - qubit grover s algorithm based on three - qubit phase gate using four - level squids coupled to a single - mode superconducting resonator . in this proposal ,",
    "adjustment of level spacing during the operation , slowly changing rabi frequencies ( to satisfy adiabatic passage ) , and the use of second - order detuning ( to achieve off - resonance raman coupling between two relevant levels ) are not required .",
    "thus , implementation time is significantly faster and has operation time of the order of nanoseconds .",
    "the coupling constants of each squid with the resonator are different .",
    "thus , an unavoidable non - uniformity in device parameters can be accommodated .",
    "we consider the effect of imperfections in the system which include the decay of the cavity field and the relevant level .",
    "we also incorporate the influence of unwanted off - resonant interaction during the gate implementation .",
    "our results show that the marked state can be searched with high fidelity even in the presence of imperfections in the system which is quite interesting .",
