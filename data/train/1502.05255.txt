    "natural systems are often characterized by complex interactions , mainly originating in the overlap of dynamical processes acting at very diverse temporal and spatial scales .",
    "examples of this multiscale dynamics can be found in several branches of geophysics .",
    "these include climate and the hydrological cycle , whose different components interact and synchronize over a wide range of scales and patterns @xcite , and ecological systems , where resilience and evolution are mainly determined by cooperation and connectivity @xcite . in a similar framework",
    "it is logical to expect that also the couplings among the different components of the system  and between the system and the surrounding  take place at multiple scales and across them .",
    "multiscale interactions have recently received extensive attention in the literature , and have been proposed as a mechanism for the triggering of extreme events @xcite , abrupt regime transitions @xcite and patterns formation @xcite",
    ".    examples of this increasing interest for multiscale and cross - scale interactions can be found in ecology @xcite and climate dynamics @xcite , but also in fields other than geosciences such as network morphology @xcite and econometrics @xcite .",
    "most of these studies are based on minimalist models of interaction across scales  @xcite , or  when some kind of data - driven approach is attempted  on classical scaling statistics , more able to resolve the scale - dependent structure of the considered processes , rather than coupling strength and directionality across scales .",
    "following this approach , the scaling properties of a wide number of dynamical processes including turbulent flows @xcite , atmospheric tracers such as precipitation @xcite , ecosystems patterns and organization @xcite , social networks @xcite , urban growth and development @xcite , and economic systems @xcite have been intensively investigated in the last decades through a variety of scaling metrics .",
    "in contrast , considerably less attention has been devoted to the analysis of couplings and feedbacks taking place at different scales and across them @xcite , to the development of ad - hoc statistics to analyze the temporal evolution of such couplings @xcite , and to the investigation of the spectral features of systems displaying strong connectivity across inter - annual , seasonal and sub - seasonal scales  @xcite .    in this study",
    "we explore the potential of a simple _ local - coupling _ metric , the wavelet cross - correlation , for identifying and assessing linear and intermittent interactions across different temporal scales in geophysical systems .",
    "time - domain correlations are routinely applied to multivariate geophysical time - series to identify phase consistency among the variables , but they fails when the variability is dominated by periodicity or when the phase consistency is intermittent .",
    "harmonics - based statistics equivalent to the time - domain correlation , like spectral coherence and cross - spectra can partially fill this gap , being able to separate the phase consistency over different persistent frequencies .",
    "however , also these spectral statistics are limited in capturing interactions that may be transient in time or may display different directionality across scales .",
    "conversely , wavelet cross - correlation can be inferred through the wavelet decomposition of observed signals , and widens the classical concept of multiscale information flow within random multiplicative processes @xcite .",
    "what is particularly appealing in this measure is its ability to decompose linear correlations in scale and time , preserving simultaneously the total correlation of the system @xcite .",
    "based on the whitening properties of wavelet filters @xcite , the wavelet coefficients describing the bi - variate process @xmath0 at each temporal scale @xmath1 can be treated as realizations of the jointly gaussian random process @xmath2 and the sample pairs @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be considered mutually independent for @xmath5 . however , if the joint - gaussianity assumption can in practice be relaxed when we test null cross - correlations , the _ null auto - correlation _ hypothesis suffers from a number of limitations  mostly depending on the degree of wavelet overlapping at the analyzed scale  which need to be considered .",
    "the essential theoretical background on wavelet cross - correlation and its significance testing are discussed in section [ sec : methods ] , together with some caveats about the inference of directional couplings from spectral statistics .",
    "section  [ autoregressive ] is devoted to test the performance of the wavelet cross - correlation in assessing scale - by - scale interaction in synthetic auto - regressive systems of known directional coupling and increasing complexity .",
    "following the test on synthetic data , section  [ la ] deals with the multiscale nature of land - atmosphere interactions through the example of the air temperature - soil moisture coupling and feedback @xcite .",
    "finally , a further discussion of wavelet cross - correlation strength and criticality is provided in section  [ dis ] , together with concluding remarks and future developments .",
    "wavelet cross - correlations are obtained through the combined use of wavelet filtering @xcite and classic linear coupling measures . + in the time domain , under stationary and ergodic assumptions , the simplest and most adopted measure of linear coupling between the trajectories of a bi - variate real - valued stochastic process",
    "@xmath0 is the cross - correlation function @xmath6 defined as : @xmath7 with @xmath8 representing the time lag ( i.e. temporal asymmetry ) between the process trajectories , @xmath9 $ ] their non - centered covariance , and @xmath10 , @xmath11 the variances of @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively . assuming that causes precede effects in time , it is common practice to associate the presence of significant correlations at non - zero lags with causal asymmetric coupling .",
    "however , when the analyzed signals display multi - scaling , non - stationarity and periodicity  or simply some form of oscillatory behavior at different frequencies ",
    "causality can hardly be inferred from classic lagged cross - correlations  ( see * ? ? ? * for a detailed discussion of the relationship between causality , co - integration and correlation ) .",
    "in fact , it is important to note that even if the analyzed signals are expected to display different coupling strengths and synchronization patterns over a wide range of temporal scales  like often the case in climate and other geophysical systems  what we finally `` see '' through the estimation of @xmath14 is only the aggregated effect of these multiscale interactions , that does not necessary reproduce the actual directionality of the coupling at a specific scale @xmath1 .    as an example",
    ", interactions between land and atmosphere such as the soil moisture - air temperature coupling discussed in section [ la ] , are characterized by strong seasonal synchronization effects that can partially mask the directionality of fine - scale interactions . however",
    ", high - frequency components  through vertical fluxes of energy and water acting at extremely localized spatio - temporal scales  still play an important role in triggering and sustaining those interactions . decomposing the correlation into its scale - by - scale components",
    "can hence shade some light on the different dynamical processes characterizing the observed coupling .",
    "this can be achieved by simply considering the analogue of lagged correlation in the wavelet domain @xcite , i.e. _ wavelet cross - correlation_. unlike integral statistics such as wavelet co - spectra and coherence @xcite , the wavelet cross - correlation is based on the `` a priori '' decomposition of the bi - variate signals through wavelet band - pass filtering and on a direct inference of scale - by - scale linear correlations from the resulting time series of sample coefficients @xmath15 .",
    "wavelet cross - correlations were first adopted in a number of experimental studies on multiscale interactions in turbulent flows and mixing @xcite , mainly based on the continuous wavelet transform ( cwt ) . following this bulk of work , whitcher and coauthors",
    "@xcite proposed an expression for wavelet cross - correlations and their confidence interval based on the maximum overlap discrete wavelet transform ( modwt ) , a variant without sub - sampling of the orthonormal discrete wavelet transform ( dwt ) @xcite .",
    "the use of modwt instead of dwt was dictated by the lack of translation invariance in the latter , strongly impacting the final lag - resolution of wavelet cross - correlations . through the modwt ,",
    "it is also possible to reduce the effects of redundancy , partially preserving invariance in the translation @xcite .",
    "however , the trade - off between lag - resolution and redundancy should be carefully evaluated depending on the specific application . in this study , based on the wide range of temporal scales over which geophysical processes evolve , and on the necessity of retaining as much information as possible about asymmetry in coupling , we opted for using the cwt together with complex analyzing wavelets , known to preserve these properties @xcite . also redundancy of cwt",
    "can not be really considered a disadvantage here , until we are not concerned with compression and the effects of auto - correlation at large scales .",
    "rather it can often become an advantage since the redundancy of cwt allows for a better visualization of correlation patterns across scales @xcite .",
    "let @xmath16 denote a sample trajectory of the _ finite energy _ random process @xmath17 . then via the cwt",
    ", we can decompose @xmath16 into a set of finite basis functions , representing its _ variability _ at different scales and instants in time  @xcite .",
    "the coefficients @xmath18 of the cwt are obtained by decomposing @xmath16 over dilated and translated wavelet functions @xmath19 of zero average and @xmath20 : @xmath21    where @xmath1 is the wavelet scale ( inverse of the pseudo - frequency ) ,",
    "@xmath22 is the translation along the time axis , @xmath23 indicates the complex conjugate of the wavelet basis function and @xmath24 is the inner product .",
    "since each trajectory of @xmath17 is a sample function from a collection of random variables @xmath25 the wavelet filtering process is asymptotically equivalent to decomposing @xmath17 in a finite number of stochastic processes @xmath26 whose realizations are the @xmath18 . in addition",
    ", it is easy to prove that the wavelet transform is equivalent to a convolution with dilated band - pass filters @xcite .",
    "thus , we can rewrite equation  ( [ eq : cwt ] ) as @xmath27 , with @xmath28 and its fourier transform given by @xmath29 .",
    "it follows that since @xmath30 is zero - average , @xmath31 is also zero and @xmath32 becomes the transfer function of a band - pass filter .",
    "the cwt extends the benefits of fourier analysis to observations involving transients and non - stationarities , allowing the estimation of _ local _ spectral density metrics such as the wavelet scalogram : @xmath33 and cross - scalogram : @xmath34 routinely used as a measure of coupling across scales",
    ". however , these and other similar metrics such as the wavelet co - spectrum and the wavelet coherence , are not able to provide any information about the temporal asymmetry of couplings at different scales , unlike wavelet cross - correlation metrics .",
    "we can now define the wavelet covariance of the random process @xmath35 at lag @xmath36 and scale @xmath1 , as : @xmath37\\ ] ] this can be alternatively expressed as  @xcite : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the co - spectrum of the two signals and @xmath40 is the _ local wavelet co - spectrum function_. therefore @xmath41 is the inverse fourier transform of the local co - spectrum , that integrated across scales gives the classical covariance among the signals @xmath42 .",
    "although , if the analyzing wavelet @xmath30 is complex also @xmath43 is a complex function and can be decomposed into a real part @xmath44 and an imaginary part @xmath45 , bearing information about the strength and the phase of the correlations .",
    "it is important to note that in this last case the conservation of @xmath42 across scales holds only for the real part of the coefficients @xcite , so that the corresponding _ wavelet cross - correlation _",
    "@xmath46 is most commonly estimated as  @xcite : @xmath47    where the @xmath48 represent the variance of the @xmath49-th variable coefficients at scale @xmath1 .",
    "this form of wavelet cross - correlation ranges between @xmath50 and @xmath51 like its time domain counterpart , and represents a simple local decomposition of the cross - correlation function in time . since the co - variance of a bi - variate complex - valued random process @xmath2 is given by : @xmath52 it is easy to show through symmetry considerations that @xmath53.\\ ] ]    therefore , if an analytic wavelet is used in the decomposition , the asymmetry in the coupling at different scales mainly derives from _ temporal _ shifts among the real parts of the coefficients , rather than from a direct wavelet phase estimation . figure  [ fig : figure_1 ] provides a conceptual representation of wavelet correlation patterns corresponding to @xmath54 driving @xmath55 ( d ) , instantaneous coupling ( e ) and @xmath55 driving @xmath54 ( f ) and the associated geometry of sample coefficients at generic scale @xmath56 ( a - c ) . here",
    "the forcing direction is assumed to be homogeneous across scales like in a red - noise dominated process lacking of characteristic forcing scales .",
    "there are a number of alternative formulations for @xmath57 , such as the one recently proposed by  @xcite , and based on the amplitudes instead of the real part of the coefficients .",
    "this neglects the information about temporal asymmetries to focus only on the amplitude of correlations across diverse scales . @xcite",
    "also proposed to estimate scale - by - scale couplings in the form of a local wavelet coherence : @xmath58    this metric however , varies between @xmath59 and @xmath51 due to the absolute operator at the nominator , thus it can not provide information about the sign of the coupling .    in the following ,",
    "@xmath60 is estimated based on the expression in equation  ( [ eq : wr ] ) , which is also the one most directly connected with linear couplings in the time domain .",
    "the corresponding estimator of @xmath61 is then given by : @xmath62}^2 } } } \\right)\\re \\left ( { \\sum { { { \\left [ { w{'_y}\\left ( { i , s } \\right ) } \\right]}^2 } } } \\right ) } } } , \\ ] ] with @xmath63 and @xmath64 being the long - term average of coefficients at scale @xmath1 .      different analyzing wavelets can lead to diverse localization effects in frequency and/or in time , that can become crucial for the identification of scale - dependent directional interactions . for this reason , in the following we estimate sample correlations @xmath65 by using two analytic wavelets with different localization in time and scale , i.e. the morlet and the paul wavelets . the morlet wavelet is defined as : @xmath66 while the paul wavelet is given by : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the non - dimensional time parameter , @xmath69 the central frequency of the morlet wavelet and @xmath70 the order parameter of the paul wavelet .",
    "the morlet wavelets are more localized ( displaying higher resolution ) in frequency than in time , while the paul wavelets display a higher temporal localization  @xcite .",
    "this comparison allows us to address the effects of time / scale resolution on the estimation of the wavelet cross correlations . following the classic work of",
    "@xcite we use @xmath71 and @xmath72 to obtain an effective trade - off in the time and frequency resolution of the decomposition .",
    "when working with the morlet wavelet , the choice of a central frequency @xmath71 is further justified by the fact that morlet is not a proper wavelet , as its integral is not zero . however , for @xmath69 larger than 5 , the integral becomes small enough to ensure the numerical applicability of the morlet kernel @xcite . as complex functions ,",
    "both the morlet and paul wavelets are suitable to study oscillatory time series , and have been extensively used in geosciences @xcite .",
    "in addition , both the morlet and paul wavelets are symmetric , allowing for a non - distorted estimation of temporal shifts . this is an important property for robust and reliable analysis of directional couplings . at the same time",
    ", we have to keep in mind that being non - orthogonal , their cwt can be affected by an overlapping of sub - frequency bands and consequent redundancies in the decomposition of the analyzed signal .",
    "similar to their time - domain counterparts , multiscale correlations can be tested for significance based on a scale - dependent approach . in the following ,",
    "we introduce a simple significance test for wavelet cross - correlations based on the assumption that the coefficients @xmath3 are sample pairs drawn from the jointly gaussian random process @xmath2 , and that @xmath65 ( @xmath73 hereafter for simplicity ) is the corresponding sample statistic for the correlation strength and direction at scale @xmath1 .",
    "such an assumption originates from the whitening properties of the wavelet transform  @xcite , and provides us with the necessary machinery to test @xmath73 against the null correlation hypothesis and construct approximate statistical confidence intervals .",
    "we show that in case of _ null correlation _ the joint - normality condition can be relaxed owing to the asymptotic properties of the sample correlation distribution in @xmath74  @xcite .    in general ,",
    "the probability distribution of the sample correlation @xmath75 is cumbersome to derive in a closed - form .",
    "one of the simplest expressions is due to fisher  @xcite and is given by : @xmath76    where @xmath77 is the gamma function and @xmath78 the sample size .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : fr ] ) , although written in terms of elementary functions , is still too complex to be explicitly used in testing .",
    "however , for @xmath74 it reduces to the null pdf proposed in 1908 by student  @xcite : @xmath79    where @xmath80 is the beta function .",
    "contrary to sample distributions for @xmath81  known to be markedly asymmetric  the probability density function in equation  ( [ eq : reduced ] ) is symmetric around @xmath59 and its derived distribution for @xmath82 reduces to a t - student with @xmath83 degrees of freedom : @xmath84    therefore , once defined a significance level @xmath85 , equations  ( [ eq : t1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : t ] ) can be used to test wavelet cross - correlations @xmath86 against the hypothesis @xmath87 , whose two - tailed rejection region lies outside @xmath88 $ ] .",
    "an alternative approach , often adopted in the literature to test the hypothesis @xmath89 for @xmath90 , relies on a variance - equalizing transformation known as fisher @xmath91-transformation : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is approximately normally distributed with mean @xmath94 $ ] and variance @xmath95 .",
    "however in this study we limit the approach to test the absence of correlation across scales .",
    "this choice is motivated by the superior robustness of the @xmath96 estimator in @xmath97 , and to the possibility of widening the usage of null distribution in equation  ( [ eq : reduced ] ) to non jointly - gaussian samples @xcite .",
    "in fact , while the expression in equation  ( [ eq : reduced ] ) can be seen as an exact representation of @xmath98 in @xmath97 , fisher s transformation only represents an approximation of @xmath98 away from @xmath59 . consequently",
    ", assuming that linearity and homoscedasticity conditions hold , the @xmath98 in @xmath97 always coincides with the null distribution of a jointly - normal process , while the non null distribution of @xmath99 is robust only under additional kurtosis constrains ( see * ? ? ?",
    "it is also worth noting that the transformation in equation  ( [ eq : t ] ) is generally assumed to be less sensitive to violations of the normality assumption @xcite , i.e. deviations of @xmath2 from a jointly gaussian distribution should not impact the test for null correlation across scales .    in geosciences",
    "it is also a common practice to test spectral statistics  such as wavelet co - spectra and coherence  against alternative null hypotheses based on the background noise of the underlying process  @xcite .",
    "the statistical significance at the desired significance level @xmath85 is therefore obtained numerically via monte carlo simulations .",
    "for example , in the case of a red background noise , the null hypothesis is obtained by monte carlo replicates  @xcite through the following steps : ( a ) a first order autoregressive model of the background noise is fitted to the observed data ; ( b ) a set of surrogates is generated from the fitted model and ( c ) a suitable confidence interval is computed producing the desired quantile bounds .",
    "however , this numerical approach has been shown to lead to spurious significant correlations in case of reduced samples  @xcite .",
    "also , it implies strong assumptions on the background noise of the observed processes .",
    "in this section we test the ability of the wavelet cross - correlation @xmath96 to capture multiscale interactions in synthetic processes of known directional coupling .",
    "large ensembles of numerically generated time series are used to understand whether @xmath96 can be used as an efficient estimator of scale - by - scale coupling strength and directionality for systems of increasing complexity .",
    "the first case study we consider is a simple first order vector auto - regressive model ( var(1 ) ) in the form : @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are coupling parameters defining the strength and directionality of the interaction between @xmath103 and @xmath104 , and @xmath105 and @xmath106 are uncorrelated noise terms with zero mean and unitary variance .",
    "figure  [ fig : figure_2]a shows a realization of the var(1 ) model in equation  ( [ eq : var1 ] ) , where the @xmath103 and @xmath104 sub - spaces were linked in a unidirectional way by imposing a coupling coefficient @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) , and a null feedback from @xmath103 to @xmath104 ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "panel b of the same figure reports the corresponding theoretical power spectra for the @xmath103 ( blue dashed line ) and @xmath104 ( green solid line ) autoregressive sub - spaces , whose lorentzian decay is typified by the absence of characteristic scales of autocorrelation .",
    "var(1 ) models , even though simple in construct , still represent a valuable benchmark for @xmath96 . red noise , or more in general @xmath110 noise spectral decay",
    "is in fact a characteristic feature of many geophysical systems  @xcite . in these models",
    "the strength and directionality of the coupling can be easily  and intuitively  tuned . also , the absence of a characteristic scale for the coupling is reflected in `` cascade - like '' @xmath96 patterns similar to the ones sketched in figure  [ fig : figure_1 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : figure_3]a - d shows the @xmath96 computed from both single and ensemble - realizations of the var(1 ) model in equation  ( [ eq : var1 ] ) for different values of the coupling parameters @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "each ensemble includes @xmath111 realizations of sample size @xmath112 , independently generated starting from random initial conditions .",
    "the wavelet cross - correlation @xmath96 is estimated as an ensemble average over all the @xmath111 realizations based on a paul mother wavelet of order @xmath72 , and thus represented as a function of temporal asymmetry @xmath36 on the abscissas and scale @xmath1 on the ordinates . figure  [ fig : figure_3]a depicts the scale - by - scale correlation patterns resulting from imposing a strong negative coupling from @xmath103 to @xmath104 ( @xmath113 ) and null feedback from @xmath104 to @xmath103 ( @xmath114 ) , while figure  [ fig : figure_3]b shows a case with opposite and weaker coupling , i.e. @xmath107 and @xmath109 .",
    "the considered var(1 ) systems are therefore both negatively coupled but with different strengths , and feedback effects are not considered at this stage .",
    "correlations below the @xmath115 significance level are masked in white .",
    "it is interesting to note how in a vector system such as the one in equation  ( [ eq : var1 ] ) , characterized by red - noise - like spectral features and `` short - memory '' , the coupling propagates along all the scales in a homogeneous way .",
    "to better highlight possible asymmetries in the coupling at different temporal scales @xmath1 and the variability in asymmetry across the diverse simulations of the ensemble , we also extracted the minimum correlation @xmath116 for each single realization and derived the ensemble minimum mean @xmath117 $ ] and standard deviation @xmath118 .",
    "the focus is here on the minimum of @xmath96 since the two synthetic systems are negatively coupled .",
    "however similar considerations on the scale - by - scale maximum of @xmath96 could be done in the case of a positively correlated process .",
    "as discussed next , @xmath119 and @xmath118 provide a rough estimate of the asymmetry and variability of peak correlations in the analyzed system .    in figure  [",
    "fig : figure_3]a - b , d , @xmath119 ( black empty circles ) and its confidence interval at the @xmath120 significance level ( bounded by the blue and red solid lines ) were overlapped to the @xmath96 diagram to show how the peak correlation moves from one side to the other of the @xmath59 bisecting line when the coupling direction is inverted .",
    "top panels in figure  [ fig : figure_3 ] also show the fast  quasi exponential  oscillatory decay of @xmath96 at different scales @xmath1 , typical of the lagged - cross correlation of an absolutely integrable signal . depending on the scale",
    ", this oscillation decays below the @xmath115 significance level more ( fine - scales ) or less ( coarse scales ) rapidly , consistently with the fact that the memory of the process is in general weaker at finer scales .",
    "we also test the ability of @xmath96 for identifying null - coupling across - scales by posing @xmath121 in equation  ( [ eq : var1 ] ) .",
    "the wavelet cross - correlation patterns obtained from a single - realization of the uncoupled system are shown in figure  [ fig : figure_3]c , while panel d depicts the corresponding ensemble statistic . as evident the ensemble @xmath96 in figure  [ fig :",
    "figure_3]d never passes the test for the non - null correlation and can robustly detect the lack of coupling across scales .",
    "also , @xmath119 oscillates around @xmath122 with strong variability at all scales",
    ".    figure  [ fig : figure_3]e finally shows the distribution of the minimum value of the @xmath96 at two selected scales , i.e.  @xmath123 and @xmath124 samples , in the case when both coupling and direction are set to vary . also here , the confidence intervals of @xmath119 are computed from an ensemble of @xmath111 realizations of the var(1 ) at the level of @xmath120 .",
    "panel e shows that for a sufficient strong value of the coupling , @xmath119 can effectively capture the switch in directionality of the coupling at both sample scales . at larger scale ( @xmath124 samples ) however , while the value of @xmath119 is higher than for the smaller scale ( @xmath123 samples ) , the variability is also higher . for any value of the coupling parameter falling in the interval",
    "@xmath125 $ ] the estimated range of variability of @xmath119 ends up crossing the zero lag axis and thus does not provide a valid estimate of the directionality of the process .",
    "therefore , the weaker the coupling , the larger the uncertainty on the actual directionality .",
    "in addition , uncertainty increases with scale due to the higher redundancy of wavelet coefficients .      in this section",
    "we test the capability of @xmath96 in detecting couplings that are well - localized in frequency ",
    "i.e. occurring at a specific time - scale .",
    "the ability to resolve such localized correlations is important to the study of environmental systems , which often display strong sub - seasonal , seasonal and inter - annual oscillations .",
    "to do so , we consider the following second order vector autoregressive model ( var(2 ) ) where a _ pseudo - periodic coupling _ from @xmath104 to @xmath103 is imposed by choosing roots close to the unit circle : @xmath126 a similar system is used in  @xcite in the context of spectral granger causality metrics . given the localization in frequency of the simulated coupling , the system in equation  ( [ eq : ar2 ] ) is additionally used to demonstrate the role of wavelet localization in the efficient estimation of @xmath96 .",
    "top panels in figure  [ fig : figure_4 ] show @xmath96 as estimated from an ensemble of @xmath111 realizations of equation  ( [ eq : ar2 ] ) , and by respectively using the morlet ( a ) and paul ( b ) wavelets . both plots",
    "only display values above the @xmath115 significance level , and they both show the confidence interval ( always @xmath120 ) for @xmath119 averaged over the @xmath111 realizations .",
    "panel c reports the theoretical power spectra of each of the @xmath103 and @xmath104 autoregressive sub - spaces displaying a clear periodicity at @xmath127 of the cycle .",
    "figure  [ fig : figure_4]a - b clearly show that the @xmath96 obtained through the morlet wavelet better identifies the frequency peak of the coupling in agreement with the characteristics of the kernel , that is by construction , more localized in frequency . in contrast ,",
    "the frequency peak in the paul @xmath96 results more spread out , especially in the range of lower scales , but better resolved in time .",
    "nonetheless , both the paul and the morlet @xmath96 are able to correctly detect the directionality ( @xmath128 ) , as evident in the left - asymmetry of @xmath119 .",
    "it is also worth noting that the variability of @xmath119 is lower where the coupling is stronger ( around the frequency peak ) , gradually increasing with the scale .",
    "this is mainly due to the size and relative higher overlapping of the wavelets at larger temporal scales . in summary , both the morlet and the paul wavelet cross - correlations are able to extract the essential features of the coupling .",
    "the choice between the two different wavelets should be made based on the application and the characteristics of the signals under investigation .      in section  [ introduction ]",
    "we argue that the evolution of geophysical systems often results from the interaction of diverse dynamical scales .",
    "a simple example can be provided by a coupling - feedback system in which the forcing is acting at shorter temporal scales than the response ",
    "i.e. a fast / slow dynamical system .",
    "in such a case , classic correlation analysis in the time domain fails unless the strength of the coupling in one of the two directions is dominant .",
    "the wavelet cross - correlation , in contrast , can still resolve the two components of the coupling , their asymmetry and characteristic scales .",
    "let us consider a modification of the var(2 ) system in equation  ( [ eq : ar2 ] ) in which @xmath103 is driving @xmath104 ( negative correlation ) at a frequency of @xmath129 of cycle ( @xmath130 ) and @xmath104 is forcing @xmath103 ( positive correlation ) around the @xmath131 of cycle ( @xmath132 ) : @xmath133    the corresponding @xmath96 estimated by using both the morlet and the paul wavelets is shown in figure  [ fig : figure_5 ] , together with the normalized spectra of the two variables .",
    "it is evident that also in this case , the @xmath96 is able to resolve the scales at which the coupling actually take place , as well as the opposite asymmetry of the correlation at these scales . in this case",
    "the @xmath119 is only representative of the coupling from @xmath103 to @xmath104 due to the negative linear correlation among the two variable at @xmath130 .",
    "however , mainly as a consequence of the strong periodicity of the coefficients at both the forcing and feedback scales , the localization of @xmath119 is also at some extent representative of the asymmetry in the coupling from @xmath104 to @xmath103 .",
    "this is overall an interesting result considering that interactions characterized by different degrees of `` memory '' and fluctuation - response relaxation ( frr ) effects are ubiquitous in geosciences  @xcite .",
    "land - atmosphere interactions , their strength and directionality , are one of the main sources of uncertainty in current climate models with strong implications for the accurate assessment of future climate change impacts at regional scales  ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "besides the scarcity of direct observations of the states and fluxes across the land - atmosphere continuum , major uncertainties originate from the inherent complexity in the way these variables interact , the multiscale character of these interactions , and the existence of critical tipping points in water and energy availability that may trigger regime transitions . in this last section ,",
    "we apply the wavelet cross - correlation analysis to a classic form of interaction between land and atmosphere : the coupling between soil moisture ( @xmath134 ) and near - surface air temperature ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "the objective is to isolate the different components of the coupling across a wide range of temporal scales ( from fine weather scales to seasonal to inter - annual ) and considering different lag - times between the variables .",
    "these two variables ( @xmath134 , @xmath135 ) are mainly related through the process of latent heat flux .",
    "they are a priori negatively correlated ; however , their coupling can occur in both directions : ( a ) @xmath135 may regulate @xmath134 via the drying of the soil due to evaporation , or ( b ) @xmath134 may regulate @xmath135 due to evaporative cooling @xcite .",
    "the latter feedback of @xmath134 on @xmath135 occurs in regions that are water - limited and it has been referred as a reason why droughts and heatwaves coexist , or follow one another @xcite .    nonetheless , the mechanisms through which different dynamical scales contribute to the onset and persistence of the @xmath134-@xmath135 coupling and feedback remain unclear to a large extent @xcite . in this study",
    "we use estimates of daily maximum air temperature obtained from the sub daily screen level ( 2 m ) temperatures of era - interim ( http://apps.ecmwf.int/datasets/data/interim full daily/ )  the most recent climate reanalysis product of the european center for medium range weather forecasts ( ecmwf ) @xcite .",
    "we consider temperature fields for the period 1980 - 2011 over a global grid with a spatial resolution of 0.75 degrees , corresponding to the native reduced gaussian grid of era @xcite .",
    "temporal resolution of the assimilated and predicted fields ( i.e. the analysis fields ) we use here is 6 hours .",
    "we extract and analyze maximum daily temperatures as they are most strongly impacted by soil moisture deficits and evaporative cooling effects @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that era - interim temperature is constrained by observations through a complex 4-d assimilation process  @xcite . as",
    "a consequence the quality of the analyzed fields is strongly dependent on the density of the station network in the region under consideration ( see * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the main advantage of reanalysis over direct observations and classical interpolation schemes is their ability to combine observations with a physical model of the atmosphere able to produce physically coherent high - resolution fields and propagate information to areas with poor observational coverage .",
    "for @xmath134 we use an independent data source , the global daily root - zone soil moisture estimates from gleam ( global land - surface evaporation : the amsterdam methodology  http://foofoo.ugent.be/satex/gleam/ as described in @xcite , also for the period 1980 - 2011 .",
    "gleam is a set of algorithms designed to retrieve information on evaporation from current satellite observations of hydro - climatic variables  @xcite . in gleam ,",
    "@xmath134 is derived at daily timescales through the assimilation of satellite soil moisture observations into a multi - layer running water balance that reproduces the infiltration of rainfall through the vertical soil profile @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : figure_6 ] shows the results of the wavelet cross - correlation analysis for different geographical locations , spanning a wide range of diverse climatic regimes . from top",
    "to bottom the panels are ordered by decreasing level of aridity .",
    "the panels in the right column show the exact geographical location of the grid points used in the analysis .",
    "wavelet cross - correlations @xmath96 in figure  [ fig : figure_6 ] represent the coupling between @xmath135 and @xmath134 at a later time , so that @xmath135 drives @xmath134 if @xmath96 is significant at negative lags and vice versa , @xmath134 drives @xmath135 for positive lags .",
    "the @xmath96 is estimated based on a paul kernel with m = 4 , as an ensemble metric across the available range of years ( 1980 - 2011 ) .",
    "the resulting correlation patterns can therefore be interpreted as _",
    "ensemble averages _ of the @xmath134-@xmath135 coupling across scales .",
    "we use here the paul wavelet based on its superior performance in resolving temporal variability .",
    "however , substantially similar results were obtained by using the morlet kernel . at each location in space , @xmath96 is computed for the entire annual cycle ( left panels ) , only boreal summer ( mjja , central panels ) and only boreal winter ( ndjf , right panels ) . before inferring @xmath96 , time - series of both @xmath135 and @xmath134 are normalized to have zero mean and unit variance .",
    "therefore , harmonic and persistent oscillations are preserved , i.e. we are not specifically analyzing seasonally de - trended anomalies , as one of the main goals is in fact to isolate the relative role of different harmonic components .",
    "as the expected correlation between @xmath135 and @xmath134 is mostly negative , the minimum correlation ( @xmath136 ) and its confidence interval can represent a proxy of temporal asymmetry in the multiscale coupling also in this case .",
    "the confidence interval of the ensemble seasonal @xmath96 ( winter or summer ) are computed by considering each summer ( or winter ) as single time series , resulting in @xmath137 annual realizations . for the full time series in contrast",
    ", the confidence interval is calculated by using a sliding window approach . at each step , @xmath96 is estimated over a time - window of @xmath138 years , sliding forward with a @xmath51 year time step .",
    "the maximum scale at which @xmath96 can be inferred in the annual and seasonal cases is limited by the size of each sample .",
    "therefore we do not consider any periodicity larger than three months for seasonal samples since this modes are only partially sampled in the data .",
    "panels a - c show @xmath96 for a location in central sahara for the full time series ( a ) , mjja ( b ) , and ndjf ( c ) . here",
    ", the extreme dryness of the soil is expected to inhibit coupling ; consequently , a significant correlation can only be found for @xmath135 driving @xmath134 at the annual scale ( circa @xmath139 days ) ( see figure  [ fig : figure_6]a ) .",
    "this coupling , however , is mostly related to the seasonal cycle of temperature since in a hot desert climate , soil moisture retrievals mostly resemble a white noise signal and sensible heat dominates the exchange of energy between land and atmosphere .",
    "the extremely erratic behavior of the soil water content is captured by the symmetry of the minimum @xmath136 ( absence of directionality in the coupling ) and by the large variability in its confidence interval ( figure  [ fig : figure_6]a ) .",
    "therefore , hot and dry desert climates can be seen here as a test for null directional coupling across scales , similarly to the synthetic case study reported in figure  [ fig : figure_3]c - d .",
    "correlation patterns radically change when we move to a location within the sahelian sub - region of mali ( figure  [ fig : figure_6]d - f ) . in this case",
    "most of the precipitation ( 200 - 400 mm ) falls during the summer months ( mjja ) , but it is sufficient to trigger the coupling between soil moisture and temperature across a wide range of temporal scales spanning a few days to months ( figure  [ fig : figure_6]d , e ) . in contrast , the coupling disappears during the winter months ( figure  [ fig : figure_6]f ) due to soil desiccation .",
    "the seasonally dry character of this climate is captured by the second harmonic at half a year ( around 180 days ) . during the entire year ( [ fig : figure_6]d ) , @xmath135 leads @xmath134 at time scales of one to 6 months , and @xmath134 leads @xmath135 at longer time scales .",
    "an analogous pattern can also be identified in northwestern australia ( figure  [ fig : figure_6]g - i ) , another seasonally dry location with a similar separation between humid and water - limited regimes . during austral summer ( ndjf ) , significant correlations are still confined to the negative lags half - quadrant - i.e. in average , @xmath135 drives @xmath134 through evaporation  although the small scales ( few days to 1 month ) are clearly the most variable in terms of asymmetry of the coupling .",
    "this fact could be connected with a higher occurrence of @xmath134 feedbacks on @xmath135 at these scales throughout the twenty - one years of the ensemble ( figure  [ fig : figure_6]e ) . compared to mali ( figure  [ fig : figure_6]d ) , the variability of @xmath136 , and consequently the uncertainty on directionality , is here less pronounced , i.e. the members in the ensemble ( g and i ) follow very similar correlation patterns at both small and large scales . during the rainy season ( austral winter , figure  [ fig : figure_6]h ) @xmath134 is not limiting evaporation , while during the summer the coupling extends throughout a wide range of scales ( figure  [ fig : figure_6]i ) , with significant correlations also at positive lags ( @xmath134 leading @xmath135 ) and at the finest scales @xcite .",
    "the separation between water - limited and _ wet _ regime is also present in the wavelet cross - correlation patterns of a temperate mid - latitude location in central france ( figure",
    "6j - l ) . during all year",
    "( [ fig : figure_6]j ) , the coupling is present at larger scales ( @xmath140 days ) , and stronger for @xmath135 leading @xmath134 than @xmath134 leading @xmath135 . during the summer months ( [ fig : figure_6]k )",
    ", negative correlations are found for negative lags , similar to the results for mali ( [ fig : figure_6]i and [ fig : figure_6]e ) and indicating an influence of @xmath135 on @xmath134 at all timescales . on the other hand , during the winter ( [ fig : figure_6]l )",
    ", @xmath134 leads @xmath135 at large scales . the confidence interval or @xmath136 , however ,",
    "mostly falls into null correlation regions and thus points to some uncertainties in these results . in general ,",
    "the seasonal separation is weaker than in mali ( 6e and f ) and northwestern australia ( [ fig : figure_6]h and l ) .",
    "finally , a site located not far from the coast of gabon is displayed in figure  [ fig : figure_6]m - o .",
    "the site is characterized by a tropical climate and strong moisture advection from the ocean , hence @xmath134 does not represent a limiting factor in this case , and the only ( positive ) observed correlation is the one derived from the synchronization between the seasonal cycle of temperature and precipitation in the region ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "overall the wavelet cross - correlation @xmath96 is able to capture the scale - by - scale strength and directionality of the @xmath134-@xmath135 coupling across different climatic regimes in a consistent way .",
    "moreover , it allows the separation of the local scale contribution from the seasonal signal - often dominant in time domain statistics .",
    "correlation results are stronger in transitional regimes , consistent with previous studies @xcite , and interestingly , the @xmath134-@xmath135 coupling propagates across all the analyzed scales during the warm season , when land - atmospheric interactions may be critical for high temperature extremes @xcite .",
    "we introduced a novel methodology to infer multiscale interactions from observations of dynamical systems that evolve over diverse temporal scales .",
    "the here adopted metric ",
    "the wavelet cross - correlation @xmath96  is based on the direct estimation of scale - by - scale correlations in the wavelet domain .",
    "the ability of @xmath96 to infer interactions across scales  and their directionality  was tested on different synthetic coupled systems and on a real - world case study of land - atmosphere interaction the coupling / feedback between soil moisture and near - surface air temperature . when applied to bi - variate",
    "auto - regressive vector models of increasing complexity the @xmath96 shows to be able to correctly reproduce the underlying directionality of the coupling at different temporal scales , and to distinguish fast / slow dynamic components within the simulated systems . in this context",
    "the term directionality is mainly used to indicate some sort of temporally lagged coupling at the considered scale , without any assumption on the causal structure of the observed process .",
    "however , it is clear that the ability of decomposing a coupling in its scale - by - scale components is an attractive feature of wavelet cross - correlation and can be used in disentangle the role of different dynamical processes in coupled geophysical systems . besides directionality is here mainly a synonymous for temporal asymmetry , and connections between causality and predictability  like in the case of more proper causality metrics like granger causality @xcite ",
    "were not yet explored .",
    "the application of wavelet cross - correlations to soil moisture and near surface air temperature shows interesting insights into the interaction of these two variables at different climate regimes .",
    "an interesting feature of this interaction , when observed through the lens of a multiscale correlation metrics like @xmath96 , is that the coupling between soil moisture and temperature , in the passage to a water limited regime , is active through an extremely wide range of scales , and that this feature represents a common signature of the coupling ( and possible feedback ) across very diverse climatic regimes .",
    "an interesting question arising from this evidence could be whether this activation of the coupling across scales is a feature reproducible in climate models .",
    "a word of caution is finally in order when we consider couplings taking place at large temporal scales ( @xmath141 1 year ) , since they could be partially affected by the redundancy  and consequent auto - correlation effects  of the continuous wavelet transform .",
    "overall results of this study demonstrate the potential of wavelet cross - correlations to unravel the relationships between two environmental and climatic variables from a purely statistical perspective .",
    "the method here described can , in principle , be applied to observations from any region of the world , and to study soil moisture - temperature coupling or any other multivariate interaction across multiple scales .",
