    "the magnitude of each momentum can be @xmath3 , whereas the total momentum remains zero .",

    "cooper triples also appear if one scattering length is positive .",
    "since the energy of the triples is continuous in @xmath144 ( @xmath9 ) , the region of three negative scattering lengths merges into the region of one positive and two negative scattering lengths at the point @xmath145 ( the other two scattering lengths are considered constant ) .",

    "if cooper pairs are built in a three component fermi gas , the pairs are typically formed between two components while the residual component remains unpaired .",
    "therefore , we compare the energy gain of a cooper triple , @xmath142 minus pole energy , with the energy gain of a cooper pair , @xmath85 minus the pole energy .",

    ", we have also plotted the energy gain of the larger constant scattering length .",
    "we find that the energy gain of the three - particle poles is much larger ( note the logarithmic axis ) . only near the threshold for the triple",
    ", the three - particle @xmath83 rapidly falls off and drops below the energy gain of both cooper pairs .",
    "this suggests that cooper triples could play an important role in three - component fermi gases in the continuum .    in principle",
    ", it should always be possible to find these positive energy poles for three negative scattering lengths .",
    "in contrast to the two - body case , the poles do not newly emerge in the medium .",
    "primarily , the poles were bound states in the vacuum which became modified by the medium , see fig .  [ fig : coopertripel ]  ( a ) .",
    "thus , the fermi momentum must be large enough to obtain positive energy poles .",
    "this is most easily achieved for cooper triples emerging from rather shallow three - body bound states in vacuum .",
    "in this paper , we have examined the influence of pauli blocking on universal two- and three - body states .",
    "first the poles of the two - body scattering amplitude in the medium were regarded .",
    "we were able to recover the physics of cooper pairs and bec - bcs crossover from the pole structure of the amplitude .",
    "in particular , we found that the binding energy of bound states decreases with rising fermi momentum due to medium effects . in the negative scattering length region ,",
    "positive energy poles emerge which can be identified with cooper pairs . in the crossover region ,",
    "the poles show a different behaviour and their nature changes with the total momentum . they can not be uniquely identified as bound states or cooper pairs .",
    "we have used the same strategy to investigate the pole structure of the three - body scattering amplitude .",
    "we found that the medium effects reduce the binding of three - body states compared to the vacuum .",
    "this is in agreement with the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the modification of the efimov spectrum for three equal - mass fermions with one of the fermions embedded in a fermi sea was calculated .",
    "moreover , we found three - body poles with positive energy .",
    "as in the two - body sector , we observed a continuous crossover from negative energy poles to positive energy poles as the fermi momentum is varied .",
    "the maximum energy of the poles was found to be @xmath147 . in analogy to the connection between positive energy poles in the two - body sector and cooper pairs , we have interpreted this as evidence for the formation of cooper triples composed out of three particles .",
    "these cooper triples are fermions and thus can not bose condense .",
    "the energy gain of such a triple was found to be larger than the energy gain of the corresponding cooper pair over a large region of scattering lengths .",
    "consequently , it appears to be energetically favorable to form a triple instead of a pair and an unpaired third atom in this region .",
    "in the case of equal pair scattering lengths , the cooper triples are su(3 ) singlets . for different scattering lengths ,",
    "however , the su(3 ) symmetry is broken ( cf .",
    "[ fig : coopertripel ] ) .",
    "if the three scattering lengths are large , the su(3 ) breaking is small since the leading corrections to the su(3 ) limit are proportional to the inverse scattering lengths @xcite .    how these three - body correlations affect a many - body system is an open question",
    ". it would be interesting to extend previous studies of the phase structure of three - component fermi gases @xcite to include the triples and investigate their influence . a qualitative picture of the many - body structure in the su(3 )",
    "symmetric limit was given by floerchinger and collaborators @xcite .",
    "they argue that at small density , if the scattering length is varied from large negative to large positive values , the bcs and bec phases are separated by a trion phase of three - body bound states . at small densities",
    ", our cooper triples must reduce to the trions of ref .",
    "@xcite . a related study for three - component fermions in an optical lattice",
    "was carried out in ref .  @xcite . within a hubbard model with su(3 ) symmetry ,",
    "a trion phase of three - fermion bound states has been predicted at strong coupling and a parallel to the baryonic phase of qcd was drawn .",
    "there may also be a connection to ref .",
    "@xcite , where boson - fermion ( bf ) interactions were regarded in a similiar analysis .",
    "bf pairs at positive energies were found and the ground state was assumed to be a fermi gas of bf - cooper pairs , since the pairs are still fermions .",
    "the interaction of three distinguishable fermions in our case could also be regarded as the interaction of a cooper pair ( boson ) and a fermion of the remaining type , if the scattering lengths are negative ( bcs region ) and at least two scattering lengths are different . in this case , we can conjecture that the ground state of the system is a fermi gas of cooper triples , which are composites of a cooper pair and a unpaired fermion .",
    "since we have only included the pauli blocking effects from the medium , further theoretical study is required . this could for example be achieved by performing monte carlo simulations of such systems similar to the two - flavour case @xcite .",
    "such a calculation would allow for more quantitative predictions of the effect .",
    "in analogy to ref .",
    "@xcite , the triples might also lead to a new type of superfluidity in three - component fermi systems which could be observed in ultracold atomic gases . for this purpose",
    ", it would be useful to calculate the interactions of the triples .",
    "if their interactions are attractive , they could again form cooper pairs and bose condense .",
    "much insight would be gained if one could calculate the energy of such a condensate and compare it with a bcs condensate .",
    "this would allow to determine under which conditions such a new type of superfluidity might occur .",
