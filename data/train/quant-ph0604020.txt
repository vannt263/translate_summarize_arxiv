    "entanglement is a remarkable feature of quantum mechanics and plays a fundamental role in quantum computation and quantum information processing . due to its fundamental importance for quantum information processing ,",
    "it has attracted much attention in recent years @xcite .",
    "the entanglement can be produced either by direct interactions between qubits @xcite , or by indirect interactions between the qubits through a third party bose .",
    "however , both of the above processes are constrained to the closed system where the influence of the environment is neglected . in real situations , a quantum system can never be isolated and will inevitably interact with its environment . a severe effect of this unwanted interaction is decoherence which generally leads to the degradation of quantum coherence and entanglement .",
    "up to now , decoherence remains to be the main obstacle to the practical implement of quantum information processing .",
    "recently , the influences of the environment on the entanglement have been investigated extensively @xcite .",
    "it was found that in certain cases the environment can act as a third party and be constructive to the production of the entanglement , in contrast to its destructive role in the ordinary situations .",
    "that is to say , depending on different coupling mechanisms between the environment and quantum system in different models , the environment has dual nature influenced on the entanglement between the qubits .    in the present work",
    ", we will show that this dual influences can be present simultaneously even in one model under certain given coupling mechanism between the environment and system .",
    "for this purpose , we model a quantum register by two or three two - level atoms with dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "we study its entanglement dynamics ( i.e. the time evolution of entanglement quantity @xcite ) under the influence of a common environment . the direct interactions between the qubits have not been considered in the previous works @xcite .",
    "the environment used here is treated as a reservoir of quantum harmonic oscillators with infinite degrees of freedom @xcite , in contrast to the single - mode model used by kim et al .",
    "@xcite . by introducing a collective mode consisting of all the qubit modes and eliminating the enormous irrelevant degrees of freedom of the environment , a quantum master equation of the atomic system",
    "can be obtained under the born - markovian approximation .",
    "we use the quantum jump approach @xcite to study the time evolution behaviors of bi- and tri - partite entanglement defined by the concurrence @xcite and the negativity @xcite , respectively .",
    "originally , the quantum jump approach @xcite was proposed to study the transition dynamics of a single atom system ( for a review , see , e.g. @xcite ) and has been used to obtain the operator solution of the master equation @xcite .",
    "the merit of using quantum jump approach is that it supplies a simple way to obtain the solution of master equation in the multipartite system with a very large hilbert space .",
    "the dynamical behavior of the bi- and tri - partite entanglement shows clearly that the environment has dual nature influenced on the entanglement in the system studied . on the one hand ,",
    "it destroys entanglement induced by the dipole - dipole interactions , which shows the decoherence nature of the environment . on the other hand ,",
    "it induces stable entanglement in an incoherent way , which shows the third party role of the environment .",
    "different from the previous works @xcite , the dual nature of the environment is shown simultaneously in the same system in our situation .",
    "the stable entanglement induced by the environment is very different from the simple oscillation behavior of entanglement with time obtained by kim _",
    "@xcite , where the memory effect of the single - mode environment was considered . here",
    "we point out that the environment in our model as a reservoir has no memory effect under the markovian approximation .",
    "the environment induces entanglement in an incoherent way since with infinite degrees of freedom it introduces an irreversibility to the dynamics of the qubit system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the model and the quantum jump approach . in section",
    "iii we study the entanglement dynamics of a two - qubit system .",
    "the entanglement dynamics of a three - qubit system is discussed in section iv . finally , section v is devoted to a brief summary .",
    "we consider a quantum register composed of @xmath0 ( = 2 and 3 in the following discussions ) identical two - level atoms coupled by dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "these atoms are assumed to be located very near , so that they feel a common environment and interact collectively with the environment .",
    "the environment is modeled by an electromagnetic field with infinite degrees of freedom which is assumed at vacuum state .",
    "if the collective interaction between atoms and the common environment is very weak and the characteristic time of correlation function of the environment is very short compared with the time scale of system evolution , then born and markovian approximations are valid . by the standard method of quantum optics @xcite , the master equation of the reduced density matrix of the system",
    "can be derived @xmath1+\\frac{% \\gamma } { 2}(2j_{-}\\rho \\left ( t\\right ) j_{+}-j_{+}j_{-}\\rho \\left ( t\\right ) -\\rho \\left ( t\\right ) j_{+}j_{- } ) ,   \\label{master}\\]]where @xmath2 is the decay constant of the collective mode represented by @xmath3and @xmath4describes the dipole - dipole interactions of the qubits . the first term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) generates a coherent unitary evolution of the density matrix , while the second term represents the decoherence effect of the environment on the system and generates an incoherent dynamics of system .",
    "it should be noted that in general case the strengths of dipole - dipole interactions are dependent on the positions of the atoms .",
    "but in our model , the separation of the atoms are very small compared to the wavelengths of the most relevant field modes , so that the fields induce a global dipole - dipole interactions(in the long wavelength limit ) , i.e. @xmath5 . thus the interaction hamiltonian becomes @xmath6by using individual mode representation eq .",

    "( [ masterin ] ) denote the individual dissipation of each atom due to the environment , while the @xmath8 terms describe the couplings between the atoms indirectly induced by the common environment .",
    "the master equation ( [ master ] ) has been used for many years to study the superradiance effect involving the interaction of collective atomic systems with the radiation field @xcite . the collective interaction between the atoms and",
    "the radiative field can induce two typical atomic states with an enhanced ( the superradiant state ) and a reduced ( the subradiant state ) spontaneous decay rate .",
    "when the atoms are confined in a very small region , the subradiant state is completely decoupled from the environment , and therefore can be regarded as a decoherence - free state . a related experiment on the superradiant spontaneous emission of two trapped ions",
    "has been reported @xcite .",
    "the common feature of the quantum master equations is the existence of the sandwich terms , where the reduced density matrix of the system is in between some quantum excitation and de - excitation operators .",
    "in general , the master equation is converted into c - number equation @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we use the quantum jump approach to obtain the exact operator solution of the master equation ( [ master ] ) .",
    "as mentioned above , the quantum - jump approach was proposed to describe single experimental realizations of simple quantum systems ( i.e. two- and three - level atoms ) @xcite and has been extensively used in quantum optics plenio98 . by using the quantum jump approach , it is straightforward to obtain the exact operator solution of the master equation .",
    "the advantage of using this method is that one does not need to deal with each element of the reduced density matrix individually , the time - dependent solution of the reduced density matrix can be obtained directly from the formal solution under the actions of operators .    by the quantum jump approach",
    "the reduced density matrix @xmath9 can be written as a sum of the conditional density matrices @xmath10 as follows @xmath11where @xmath12 is the total density matrix of the system and the quantized environment , @xmath13 is the partial trace over the modes of the environment , and @xmath14 is the projection operator on the state of the quantized environment field that contains @xmath15 photons .",
    "the @xmath16 denotes the reduced density matrix of the system with @xmath15 photons detected in the environment .",
    "the time evolution equation of @xmath17 can be derived readily , @xmath18where @xmath19 .",
    "( 3 ) reflects that the time evolution of the reduced density matrix consists of smooth evolutions which are interrupted by instantaneous quantum jumps .",
    "it is clear to see that the hierarchy of the conditional density matrices @xmath20 is terminated by instantaneous quantum jumps automatically . due to the dissipative effect of the environment ,",
    "the effective hamiltonian @xmath21 governed the smooth evolution is a non - hermitian operator .",
    "it is straightforward to write down the formal operator solution of eq .",
    "( conequ ) @xmath22where @xmath23 is the initial state .",
    "thus , the total reduced density matrix of the system can be obtained by the summation over all the conditional density operators @xmath17 . in the following",
    "we explicitly consider the two - qubit and three - qubit systems .",
    "to simplify the following calculations , we use the collective state representation @xcite .",
    "the representation space is spanned by the common eigenstates of the complete set of commuting operators @xmath24 for two - qubit system .",
    "this collective state representation can also be obtained by the angular momentum additive rules and the clebsch - gordan coefficients from the product state representation of the individual ones @xcite .",
    "the two - qubit basis denoted by @xmath25 includes the spin singlet and triplet @xmath26where @xmath27 are the eigenstates of @xmath28 with elgenvalus @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath30 act on the collective basis by @xmath31    when a total system is composed of two subsystems described by a two - dimensional hilbert state , the general measure of entanglement between these two subsystems is the entanglement of formation @xcite .",
    "this quantity can be analytically calculated as a function of the concurrence @xmath32 @xcite , which can also be taken as a measure of the entanglement .",

    "@xmath36 is the complex conjugation of @xmath37 .",
    "the concurrence varies from @xmath38 for a disentangled state to @xmath39 for a maximally entangled state .",
    "we shall use the concurrence to quantify the degree of entanglement in the two - qubit system .    in the following numerical investigations ,",
    "our guide line is to explore the following topics of entanglement dynamics :    \\(1 ) two kinds of entanglement generation mechanisms and their different roles played : direct coherent generation due to the atomic dipole - dipole interaction and indirect incoherent generation due to the common environment coupling to the qubits . from eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) we can see that the atomic dipole - dipole interactions in @xmath40 produce a dynamical coherence which oscillates in time , and the common environment induces an effective interaction which produces the entanglement in steady states .",
    "besides , the common environment also produces a dissipative term which makes all the eigen states of the operator of the master equation decay and finally die out except the steady states with zero eigen values @xcite .",
    "thus in the dissipative dynamics , the dynamical coherence as a transit phenomenon will be destroyed finally by the dissipation , only the environment induced coherence and entanglement in the decoherence - free steady states survive . in the following numerical study ,",
    "the two kinds of entanglement generation show clearly in the figures .",
    "\\(2 ) how does the environment produce an entangled steady state from a separable initial state ?",
    "this issue is closely related to the generation of an entanglement source and is thus very significant .",
    "\\(3 ) how does the entanglement measure evolve and change in time from an initial entangled state under the influence of the common environment ?",
    "this issue is related to the decoherence of a multi - qubit system and is thus practically helpful in the understanding of the decoherence dynamics .",
    "\\(4 ) as the decoherence - free subspace has more than one dimensions , the steady state will be a probabilistic mixture of the decoherence - free states .",
    "how does one choose a proper initial state to get a desired steady state ?    in order to show explicitly the entanglement dynamics of the two - qubit system , we take the initial state @xmath41 as our first example . expanding this state in the collective basis of eqs .",
    "( twobas ) and substituting it into eqs .",
    "( [ solu ] ) , we can obtain analytically the solution of the master equation ( [ master ] ) after some calculations @xmath42the time evolution behavior of the entanglement measure , i.e. the concurrence , can be determined by @xmath43    from eqs .",
    "( [ solut ] ) and ( [ tconcu ] ) we can see that the steady solution of the atomic system under the long time limit is @xmath44 which is an equal probabilistic mixture of the extremal states @xmath45 and an entangled mixed state with @xmath46 .",
    "the extremal states @xmath47 is the so - called subradiant state @xcite and maximal entangled pure state .",
    "this means that due to the symmetry of the interaction between the system and the environment , the system induces a collective entangled state which is immune to the decoherence .",
    "this entangled decoherence - free state contributes to the stable entanglement produced by the environment . from the purification scheme proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite many pairs of this states can be used to distill out a maximal entangled state @xmath48 with probability 1/16 .",
    "the time evolution behavior of the concurrence is showed in fig .",
    "we consider three cases of the dipole - dipole interaction : absence ( @xmath50 , dotted line ) , weak ( @xmath51 , dashed line ) , and strong ( @xmath52 , solid line ) . in the case of @xmath50 ,",
    "the entanglement increases monotonously and approaches to a stable value .",
    "since there are no dipole - dipole interaction between the qubits , it is quite clear that this entanglement is induced purely by the environment .",
    "this is a typical example that the environment plays a constructive role in the entanglement formation between qubits .",
    "when the dipole - dipole interaction is switched on , the entanglement induced by the environment is not affected but an oscillating dynamical contribution added to the total entanglement is observed .",
    "the stronger the dipole - dipole interaction is , the faster the entanglement oscillates , as seen easily from eq . ( [ tconcu ] ) . to see the contribution of the dipole - dipole interaction to the entanglement , in fig .",
    "[ purec2 ] we plot the quantity of @xmath53 as a function of time .",
    "it is shown that the entanglement induced by the dipole - dipole interaction decays rapidly as shown by solid line , which indicates that the environment plays a destructive role to the entanglement induced by the coherent interaction . to confirm this",
    ", we switch off the environment , i.e. , @xmath54 . in this situation , the entanglement induced by the coherent interaction oscillates without dissipation , as the dashed line shown in fig .",
    "[ purec2 ] . to summarize ,",
    "the environment can act as a third party to induce the entanglement between the qubits incoherently .",
    "it also plays an usual role of dissipation to destroy the entanglement induced coherently by the dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "the dual nature of both construction and destruction roles played by the environment on the entanglement generation can be seen clearly by the above numerical analysis .    to explore the dependence of the steady state entanglement on initial states , in the following we take the werner states as the initial states .",
