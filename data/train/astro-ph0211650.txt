    "it has long been suspected that the most luminous agn are powered by accretion of matter onto massive black holes ( hereafter @xmath8 ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this belief , combined with the observed evolution of the space - density of agn @xcite and the high incidence of low luminosity nuclear activity in nearby galaxies @xcite , implies that a significant fraction of luminous galaxies must host black holes of mass @xmath14 .",
    "it is now clear that a large fraction of hot spheroids ( e - s0 ) contains a @xmath8@xcite with mass proportional to the mass ( or luminosity ) of the host spheroid ( @xmath15 e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "recently @xcite and @xcite have shown that a tighter correlation holds between the bh mass and the velocity dispersion of the bulge .",
    "clearly , any correlation of black hole and spheroid properties would have important implications for theories of galaxy formation in general , and bulge formation in particular .",
    "however , to date , there are very few secure bh measurements or upper limits in spiral galaxies even though we know that agns are common in such systems @xcite . in total , there are 37 _ secure _ @xmath8  detections according to @xcite or just 22 according to @xcite , depending on the definition of `` secure '' .",
    "only @xmath16 of these @xmath8  detections ( 7/37 or 4/22 , respectively ) are in galaxy types later than s0 , and only 3 in sbc s and later ( the milky way , @xcite ; ngc 4258 , @xcite ; ngc 4945 , @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore important to directly establish how common are bhs in spiral galaxies and if they follow the same @xmath11-@xmath17 , @xmath11-@xmath13  correlations as elliptical galaxies .",
    "this can be achieved only with a comprehensive survey for @xmath8s that covers quiescent and active spiral galaxies of all hubble types .",
    "such a survey would pin down the mass function and space density of @xmath8s , and their connection with host galaxy properties ( e.g. , bulge mass , disk mass etc ) .    to detect @xmath8s",
    "one requires spectral information at the highest possible angular resolution : the `` sphere of influence '' @xcite of @xmath8s are typically @xmath18  even in the most nearby galaxies .",
    "nuclear absorption - line spectra can be used to demonstrate the presence of a @xmath8  @xcite , but the interpretation of the data is complex because it involves stellar - dynamical models that have many degrees of freedom  that can be pinned down only when data of very high s / n are available @xcite .",
    "radio - frequency measurements of masers in disks around @xmath8s provide some of the most spectacular evidence for @xmath8s , but have the disadvantage that only a small fraction of the disks will be inclined such that their maser emission is directed toward us @xcite .",
    "studies of ordinary optical emission lines from gas disks provide an alternative and relatively simple method to detect @xmath8s .",
    "hst studies have discovered many cases of such gas disks in early - type galaxies ( m87 , @xcite ; ngc 4261 , @xcite ; ngc 5322 , @xcite ; cen a , @xcite ) and have demonstrated that both their rotation curves and line profiles are consistent with thin disks in keplerian motion @xcite .    in",
    "early - type galaxies there are still worrying issues about the dynamical configuration of nuclear gas ( e.g. , misalignment with the major axis , irregular structure etc ) .",
    "by contrast nuclear gas in relatively quiescent spirals is believed to be organized into well defined rotating disks seen in optical line images ( e.g. , m81 , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite recently found that the majority of spiral galaxies in their survey has irregular velocity fields in the nuclear gas , not well suited for kinematical analysis .",
    "still , @xmath19 of the galaxies where @xmath20  emission was detected all the way to the center have velocity curves consistent with circular rotation and the galaxies with more complicated velocity curves can also be useful for @xmath8  mass measurement after detailed analysis of the spectra . indeed , even in the most powerful seyfert nuclei such as ngc 4151 , where the gas is known to",
    "be interacting with radio ejecta , it may be possible to get the mass of the @xmath8from spatially resolved hst spectroscopy by careful analysis of the velocity field to separate the underlying quiescently rotating disk gas from that disturbed by the jets @xcite .    prompted by these considerations",
    ", we have undertaken a spectroscopic survey of 54 spirals using stis on the hubble space telescope .",
    "our sample was extracted from a comprehensive ground - based study by axon et al .  who obtained @xmath20  and @xmath21}$ ]  rotation curves at a seeing - limited resolution of 1 , of 128 sb , sbb , sc , and sbc spiral galaxies from rc3 .",
    "by restricting ourselves to galaxies with recession velocities @xmath22km / s , we obtained a volume - limited sample of 54 spirals that are known to have nuclear gas disks and span wide ranges in bulge mass and concentration .",
    "the systemic velocity cut - off was chosen so that we can probe close to the nuclei of these galaxies , and detect even lower - mass black holes .",
    "the frequency of agn in our sample is typical of that found in other surveys of nearby spirals , with comparable numbers of weak nuclear radio sources and liners .",
    "the sample is described in detail by axon et al .",
    "( paper in preparation ) .",
    "this paper presents the observations of ngc 4041 , the first object observed , and a detailed description of the analysis and modeling techniques which will be applied to the other galaxies in the sample . from the lyon / meudon extragalactic database ( leda ) , ngc 4041 is classified as a sbc spiral galaxy with no detected agn activity .",

    "ngc 4041 was observed with stis on the hst in 1999 july 7 .",
    "an @xmath32 acquisition image was obtained with the f28x50lp filter and the galaxy nucleus , present within the field of view , was subsequently centered and re - imaged following the acq procedure .",
    "the exposure time of the acquisition images was 120@xmath27 .",
    "the observational strategy consisted in obtaining spectra at three parallel positions with the central slit centered on the nucleus and the flanking ones at a distance of 02 .",
    "the slit positions are overlaid on the acquisition image in figure  [ fig : acq ] and their position angle is 43 . at each slit position we obtained two spectra with the g750 m grating centered at @xmath20 , with the second spectrum shifted along the slit by an integer number of detector pixels in order to remove cosmic - ray hits and hot pixels .",
    "the nuclear spectrum ( nuc ) was obtained with the 01 slit and no binning of the detector pixels , yielding a spatial scale of 00507/pix along the slit , a dispersion per pixel of @xmath33    and a spectral resolution of @xmath34 .",
    "the off - nuclear spectra ( pos1 and pos2 ) were obtained with the 02 slit and @xmath35 on - chip binning of the detector pixels , yielding 0101/pix along the slit , 1.108  / pix along the dispersion direction and @xmath36 .",
    "total exposure times were 950@xmath27  for the nuc position and 420@xmath27  and 500@xmath27  for pos1 and pos2 , respectively .",
    "the acquisition images were flat - fielded , realigned and co - added in order to improve the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the pixel scale is @xmath37 .",
    "the flux calibration was first obtained using the photflam header in the image .",
    "we subsequently applied a color correction to convert to johnson r magnitudes . in order to do this , we used the average spectra of sb and sc spiral galaxies from @xcite as spectral templates .",
    "the raw spectra were reprocessed through the _ calstis _ pipeline using the darks obtained daily for stis .",
    "standard pipeline tasks were used to obtain flat - field corrected images .",
    "the two exposures taken at a given slit position were then realigned with a shift along the slit direction ( by an integer number of pixels ) and the pipeline task _ ocrreject _ was used to reject cosmic rays and hot pixels .",
    "subsequent calibration procedures followed the standard pipeline reduction described in the stis instrument handbook @xcite , i.e.   the spectra were wavelength calibrated and corrected for 2d distortions .",
    "the expected accuracy of the wavelength calibration is @xmath38 pix within a single exposure and @xmath39 pix among different exposures @xcite which converts into @xmath40 ( relative ) and @xmath41 ( absolute ) .",
    "the relative error on the wavelength calibration is negligible for the data presented here because our analysis is restricted to the small detector region including @xmath20  and @xmath21}$ ]  ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "the nominal slit positions obtained as a result of the stis acq procedure were checked by matching the light profiles measured along the slit with the synthetic ones derived from the acquisition   with respect to the position of the target determined by the stis acq procedure ( 0,0 position in figure  [ fig : acq ] ) .",
    "we selected the spectral regions containing the lines of interest and subtracted the continuum by fitting a linear polynomial row by row along the dispersion direction .",
    "the continuum subtracted lines were then fitted row by row with gaussian functions using the task longslit in the twodspec figaro package @xcite and the task _ specfit _ in the iraf _ stsdas _ package . when the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) was insufficient ( faint line ) the fitting was improved by co - adding two or more pixels along the slit direction .",
    "wfpc2 images in the f450w ( @xmath43b ) , f606w ( @xmath43r ) and f814w ( @xmath43i ) filters were retrieved from the archive .",
    "these images encompass the entire galaxy with the nucleus located in the wf3 chip .",
    "the data were automatically reprocessed with the best calibration files available before retrieval .",
    "two exposures were performed in each of the three filters , in order to remove cosmic rays .",
    "warm pixels and cosmic rays were removed ( stsdas tasks _ warmpix _ and _ crrej _ ) and mosaicked images with spatial sampling of 01/pix were obtained using the _ wmosaic _ task , which also corrects for the optical distortions in the four wfpc2 chips .",
    "the background was estimated from areas external to the galaxy where no emission is detected .",
    "flux calibration to vega magnitudes was performed using the zero points by @xcite . to convert to standard filters in the johnson - cousins system we estimated the color correction using various spectral templates , a0v and k0v stars and the sb and sc spiral spectra from @xcite .",
    "the color corrections are the following : @xmath44 ( sb , k0v ) and @xmath45 ( a0v ) ; @xmath46 ( sb , k0v ) and @xmath47 ( sc , a0v ) ; @xmath48 ( sb , k0v ) and 0.0 ( sc , a0v ) . with these corrections ,",
    "the differences between colors from johnson - cousins and hst instrumental magnitudes are @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 according to the templates used .",
    "unless stated otherwise , we have applied the color corrections derived from the k0v star and sb spiral templates , which are most suitable to the present data .",
    "ngc 4041 was also observed with nics @xcite at the telescopio nazionale galileo ( tng ) in 2001 february 12 using the @xmath52 filter and the small field camera which yields a 013 pixel size .",
    "the night was not photometric and seeing during the observations was @xmath53 .",
    "observations consisted of several exposures , each with the object at a different position on the array .",
    "data reduction consisted in flat - fielding and sky subtraction .",
    "the frames were then combined into a mosaic . in order to flux calibrate the nics image",
    "we have used the 2mass image available on the web .",
    "the 2mass k band image is flux calibrated to an accuracy of @xmath54mag and has a spatial resolution of @xmath55 with a pixel size of 1 .",
    "we have therefore degraded the spatial resolution of the nics image to the 2mass image and rebinned to 1  pixels .",
    "we have performed ellipse fitting to both images and rescaled the nics image to the flux calibrated 2mass data by comparing the light profiles .",
    "the nics image and wfpc2 images were then realigned by cross correlating common features in the nuclear region , because no point sources are present in the near infrared image . the main feature which drives",
    "the correlation is the strong nuclear peak , however we have checked that , even excluding the central peak , the shift between the images can be determined with an accuracy of @xmath56 ( i.e.  @xmath57 pixels of wfpc2 ) in both directions . with this accuracy the nuclear continuum peaks present in both optical and infrared images are consistent with being at the same position .",
    "line - of - sight velocities , full width at half maxima ( hereafter fwhm ) and surface brightnesses along each slit were obtained by fitting single gaussians to @xmath20  and @xmath21}$ ]  emission lines in each row of the continuum - subtracted 2d spectra . in the left panels of figure  [ fig : rotlarge ]",
    "we plot the measured velocities . beyond @xmath58 of the nucleus velocities",
    "show considerable small scale variations likely due to local gas motions which do not reflect the mass distribution .",
    "therefore we averaged velocities by binning the spectra in steps of 1  ( 10 rows in nuc and 5 in pos1,2 ) , while , within @xmath58 of the nucleus velocities are measured along each row to take advantage of all the spatial information .",
    "similarly , the central and right panels in figure  [ fig : rotlarge ] display fwhms and @xmath20  surface brightnesses as measured along the slit .    in figure",
    "[ fig : rotlarge ] , the dotted line superimposed on the nuc rotation curve represents the @xmath20  surface brightness shown in the right central panel .",
    "this helps to distinguish the presence of two components : an extended one , characterized by a low surface brightness ( @xmath59 ) , roughly constant along the slit , and nuclear one , compact ( within @xmath60 and 04 ) , bright and cospatial with the position of the nuclear continuum peak .",
    "this might be interpreted as a nuclear disk of the same extent as the nuclear stellar cluster described in  [ sec : morpho ] . as shown in more detail in the right hand panel of figure  [ fig : rotnuc ] ,",
    "the emission line surface brightness of the nuclear disk is double peaked while the nuclear continuum source , roughly coincident with the center of rotation , is located in  between the two peaks .",
    "fitting single unconstrained gaussians is acceptable for the extended component but it does not produce good results for the points in the nuclear region .",
    "in particular a single gaussian fit produces velocities of @xmath20  and @xmath21}$ ]  which differ by as much as @xmath61 ( see figure  [ fig : rotnuc ] ) .",
    "this is not a worrisome issue if the amplitude of the rotation curve is a few 100 @xmath26@xmath27@xmath28  but makes interpretation of the data uncertain in the present case where the amplitude of the nuclear rotation curve is only @xmath1 .",
    "a careful analysis of the line profiles in the nuclear region shows that they are persistently asymmetric with the presence of a blue wing ( see figure  [ fig : fits ] ) .",
    "a fit row by row with two gaussian components , the main component and the blue one , with the constraint that they have the same velocities and widths for @xmath20and @xmath21}$ ] , shows that , within the large uncertainties , the `` blue wing '' has always the same velocity and width .",
    "we have then deblended the `` blue '' component in the spectrum obtained by co - adding the central 5 rows .",
    "the velocity and width of the blue component were then used in the row by row fit .",
    "the constrained fit is good and @xmath20  and @xmath21}$ ]  now have the same velocity in the main component .",
    "the measured velocities , fwhms and @xmath20surface brightnesses in the nuclear region are shown in figure  [ fig : rotnuc ] where we also plot , as a comparison , the values obtained from unconstrained single gaussian fits of @xmath20  and @xmath21}$ ] . given the signal - to - noise of the present data , the nature of the blue wing is , as yet , unclear .",
    "the velocity field of the extended component shows a quasi - linear gradient of @xmath62 which agrees with the velocity gradient ( figure  [ fig : ground ] ) measured from ground - based observations at the same pa as our stis spectra ( axon et al . , paper in preparation ) .",
    "the velocity gradient measured from the ground based rotation curve is shown as a straight line in the figures .",
    "the large scale trend observed from hst matches very well the expected gradient from the solid body part of the ground based rotation curve although it presents structures at small scales .    within 05 of the nucleus",
    ", the velocity field shows a smooth s - shaped curve with a peak to peak amplitude of only 40@xmath26@xmath27@xmath28   ( left panel of figure  [ fig : rotnuc ] ) .",
    "overall there is no hint of a steep keplerian rise around a point - like mass .",
    "the central velocities of the nuclear curves are systematically offset from the large scale velocity field by @xmath63 ( compare with the dashed line which is the solid body part of the rotation curve - left panel of figure  [ fig : rotnuc ] ) .",
    "the off - nuclear slits show essentially the same velocity field as the on - nucleus slit .",
    "thus this blueshift must be real and not an instrumental artifact generated by light entering the slit off center ( for a detailed discussion on the effects of light entering the slit off - center see @xcite ) .",
    "for example , consider the case in which the peak of line emission is on the blue side ( left on figure  [ fig : acq ] ) of the nuc slit .",
    "then the measured velocity will be blueshifted with respect to the true value .",
    "the same would happen for pos1 .",
    "however in pos2 the peak of the line emission will be on the red side of the slit and the measured velocities will be shifted to the red with respect to the true value .",
    "this is not the case for our data .",
    "the possible origin and implications of this blueshift are discussed in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the acquisition image , shown in figure  [ fig : acq ] , has a field - of - view of @xmath64 . in figure",
    "[ fig : images ] we show the inner @xmath65 and @xmath64 of the wfpc2 and nics images . finally in figure",
    "[ fig : colours ] we plot the color maps .",
    "the acquisition image ( figure  [ fig : acq ] ) shows a compact but resolved ( fwhm@xmath66 ) bright central feature superimposed to the central region of the bulge . a second bright feature is present @xmath67 sw of the nucleus .",
    "figure  [ fig : acqprof ] represents the radial light profile from the stis acquisition image . as already clear from the acquisition image ,",
    "the light profile indicates the presence of a bright central feature .",
    "this feature is spatially extended as can be seen from a comparison with the light profile of an unresolved source ( ngc 4051 ) obtained with the same instrumental setup .",
    "this nuclear feature is likely to be a star cluster ; a photometrically distinct star cluster is often present in the dynamical center of spiral galaxies of all hubble types ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the same central source is visible in all the wfpc2 images and an analysis of its colors ( figure  [ fig : colours ] ) indicates that it is bluer than the surrounding regions but still redder than the galaxy disk and bulge .",
    "its vega magnitudes in the three wfpc2 filters are 19.10 ( f450w ) , 18.05 ( f606w ) and 17.16 ( f814w ) with formal uncertainties of @xmath68mag .",
    "these values , converted to johnson magnitudes , become b=19.2 , r=17.7 , i=17.1 for the k0v and sb spiral spectra and b=19.1 , r=18.0 , i=17.15 for the a0v and sc spiral spectra .",
    "the star cluster emission is very weak in the k band and not readily visible but its location is coincident with the location of the k band peak within the alignment uncertainties ( @xmath69 , see figure  [ fig : images ] ) .",
    "the color images show that the inner few arcseconds are redder than the galaxy disk and bulge and this could either be due to the presence of obscuration by dust or to a change in stellar population .    from several galaxy catalogues it can be inferred that the inclination of the large scale disk is @xmath70 .",
    "this is supported by the nearly circular isophotes observed in the nics and wfpc2 images at large scales @xmath71 . however , in the inner regions , a bar - like structure is visible in the k band image oriented @xmath43 e - w .",
    "it is extended for @xmath72 i.e.  @xmath73 with isophotes symmetrically twisted on both ends .",
    "the twisting is most likely due to spiral arms just outside ( and apparently connecting to ) the bar .",
    "these give the bar the appearance of being larger than it is .",
    "it is well known ( see , e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that strong concentrations of young stars can dominate the k - band .",
    "this likely happens in the region where spiral arms emanate from the bar in ngc  4041 :",
    "blue - star complexes are seen in color images there , particularly at the west end ( figure  [ fig : images ] ) .",
    "the bar itself is rather short with semi - major axis length at most @xmath74 , and a position angle of about 60 .",
    "it is a weak bar , given the fatness of the observed structure and that it is lacking the pair of dust lanes characteristic for strong bars @xcite .",
    "instead , a mini - spiral structure is seen in the stis acq image ( figure  [ fig : acq ] ) , extending at least out to @xmath75 from the nucleus , i.e.  throughout the entire ir bar .",
    "such a morphology indicates that we should nt expect strong departures from the circular motion in the gas flow .",
    "in fact , the co velocity field observed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their figure  1f ) shows no such deviations down to the @xmath76 beam size of the observations .",
    "the pa of the kinematical line of nodes is  @xmath77 , close to the pa of the bar .",
    "the canonical way to derive light profiles from images is to fit ellipses to the isophotes and to measure encircled fluxes .",
    "however , inspection of figures  [ fig : acq ] and [ fig : images ] indicates the presence of small scale structures invalidating the ellipse fits of the wfpc2 and stis images .",
    "the nics image is much smoother but the ellipticity of its inner isophotes is caused by the presence of a bar and spiral arms and not by geometrical projection effects . since the inclination of the large scale disk is only @xmath78 , one expects almost circular isophotes , and it is reasonable to obtain the light profiles from azimuthal averages instead of canonical ellipse fitting .    in figure  [",
    "fig : profiles ] we plot the azimuthally averaged light profiles extracted from the wfpc2 and nics images .",
    "the light profiles have all been rescaled to match the external one of the f814w image .",
    "the profiles all match well beyond @xmath79 and the colors of that region can be estimated as @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "these colors are consistent with other spiral galaxies : for instance @xcite has shown that the spirals of this hubble type on average have integrated colors @xmath83 ( observed 1.7 ) and @xmath84 ( 3.8 ) .    the red feature observed in the color maps around the nucleus results in a flattening of the light profiles which increases at decreasing wavelength . from the figure",
    "one can immediately estimate the color excess or reddening for each pair of bands with respect to the external points .",
    "roughly @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 . assuming the galactic extinction law by @xcite one finds that with @xmath88 mag one can approximately match the observed color excesses ( @xmath88 implies @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 ) .",
    "thus the red feature observed in the color maps is likely to be due to extinction by dust with average value of @xmath88 mag .",

    "this inversion is not unique if the gravitational potential does not have a spherical symmetry . here",
    ", we assume that the gravitational potential is an oblate spheroid ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we further assume that the principal plane of the potential has the same inclination as the large scale disk ( @xmath92 , leda and @xcite ) .",
    "the knowledge of @xmath93 , combined with the observed axial ratio of the isophotes , should directly provide the axial ratio of an axisymmetric light distribution , but the presence of a bar - like structure invalidates this approach since the flattening of the isophotes can not be ascribed to simple projection effects .",
    "therefore we consider two extreme cases : a spherical and a disk light distribution . the model light profiles are computed taking into account the finite spatial resolution and pixel size of the detector",
    "a detailed description of the relevant formulas for the inversion and fitting procedure is presented in appendix  [ app : stardens ] .",
    "the light profiles derived from hst images have better spatial resolution than the one derived from ground - based nics image .",
    "however , as shown above , the optical hst images suffer from @xmath94 mag extinction in the nuclear region .",
    "it is also well known that k band light is a better tracer of mass .",
    "therefore it is useful to use both the hst and ground based light profiles in order to infer the mass profiles .",
    "the star cluster is probably washed out by the lower spatial resolution in the nics image , thus , in order to account for its presence one can determine its geometrical parameters from the fit of the hst light profiles and use them in the fitting the nics image .    in principle",
    ", the wfpc2 images could be reddening corrected by using the color maps in figure [ fig : colours ] to derive the @xmath95 map . in order to do this",
    ", one might assume that the colors in the nuclear region are constant and equal to those beyond 10  ( see figure [ fig : profiles ] ) .",
    "for a more detailed description of this procedure see for instance @xcite .",
    "however the cluster would be forced to have the same intrinsic color as the galactic disk , which is probably not realistic .",
    "moreover its shape would be affected by psf differences among the images .",
    "finally it is not clear if the color differences are due entirely to reddening .",
    "we therefore decided not to apply any reddening correction and the consequences of this will be discussed in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we first consider the light profile derived from wfpc2/f814w because it is the least sensitive to reddening among the hst images .",
    "we then fit a model light distribution composed of the central star cluster and the more extended component .",
    "we assume that the star cluster luminosity density is spherically symmetric with a density law : @xmath96 the extended component has a functional form of the type @xmath97 where @xmath98 corresponds to the radius in the spherical case and @xmath99 is the axial ratio of the mass distribution .",
    "this functional form of the extended component is a reasonable description of the central part of the galaxy where the bulge dominates .",
    "it is sufficient for our purposes because we are interested in modeling only the inner @xmath100 .    in equation  [ eq : dens ] , @xmath101 for a spherical light distribution , and @xmath102 for a disk - like one",

    "the right panels in figure  [ fig : fitprofs ] show the fit in the spherical case which , as before , is visually indistinguishable from the disk - like case .",
    "the values of the reduced @xmath105  reported in table  [ tab : fitprofs ] are much larger than the expected value of 1 and the main reason can be found in the systematic deviation of the residual around 3(figure  [ fig : fitprofs ] ) where the data are systematically lower than the model .",
    "this systematic deviation , whose maximum value is @xmath106 dex , i.e.  7% , is present in both the optical and near - ir light profile and is caused by the presence of the bar - like feature .",
    "the fits to the light profiles allow an estimate of the i and k magnitudes of the star cluster . with the assumed distance ,",
    "the cluster luminosity is @xmath107 where @xmath108 refers to the f814w band ( in this band the sun has @xmath109 ) . in the k band",
    ", the cluster has @xmath110 for the spherical and @xmath111 for the disk cases ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "these results suggest that the cluster could be blue , with estimated color @xmath113 ( or 0.5 in the disk case ) .",
    "the estimate of the k mag of the cluster is however uncertain due to the fact that the cluster is unresolved in the ground based observations . in order to set a limit to the amount of the cluster contribution to the k band light profile , in figure  [ fig : fitprofs ] we also plot the results of the fit when the cluster normalization has been fixed to a value 0.6 dex larger ( i.e.  the cluster is 1.5 magnitudes brighter ) than the best fit value ( dashed line ) .",
    "the fit is worse , as clearly indicated by the residuals , and we consider this a firm upper limit for the cluster contribution to the k band light profile .",
    "this implies that the observed color of the cluster is @xmath114 .",
    "if we assume that the cluster is subjected to @xmath115 mag of extinction (  [ sec : profiles ] ) , the upper limit changes to @xmath116 .    figure  [ fig : vels ] shows the circular velocities in the principal plane of the potential expected from the density distributions determined from the fit of the nics and hst data . in order to match the different rotation curves the circular velocities are plotted for @xmath117 or @xmath118 , the values derived in  [ sec : modelkin ] from fitting the rotation curves .",
    "it is clear that the rotation curves are very similar beyond @xmath119 .",
    "however they differ at smaller radii because of the different contribution of the star cluster to the total mass budget .",
    "this difference is due to the fact that the mass - to - light ratio has been assumed constant in each band .      in order to model the gas kinematical data ( velocities and widths measured along the slit ) we select the simplest possible approach and we assume that the ionized gas is circularly rotating in a thin disk located in the principal plane of the galaxy potential .",
    "the latter assumption is not needed if the galaxy potential has a spherical symmetry .",
    "we assume that the disk is not pressure supported and we neglect all hydrodynamical effects .",
    "thus the disk motion is completely determined by the gravitational potential which is made of two components : one is stellar and is completely determined by the mass distribution , derived in the previous section , and by its mass - to - light ratio @xmath120 .",
    "the other one comes from a dark mass concentration ( the black hole ) , spatially unresolved at hst+stis resolution and defined by its total mass @xmath11 .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in principle , in order to constrain the @xmath8  mass , one should compare the emission line profile predicted by the model with the observed one . even in the simple potential described above",
    ", the line profiles can be very complicated , with multiple peaks @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , as shown in figure  [ fig : fits ] , the line profiles are well represented by single gaussians ( after subtracting the `` blue '' component ) and therefore we compare the moments of the line profiles : the average velocity @xmath121 and velocity dispersion @xmath122 defined as @xmath123 . in order to be compared with the observations , the model @xmath121 and @xmath122 are computed taking into account the spatial resolution of hst / stis and the size of the apertures over which the observed quantities are measured .",
    "the formulae used to compute velocities , widths and line fluxes and the details of their derivation , numerical computation and model fitting are described in appendix  [ app : gaskin ] . to derive the observed @xmath121 and @xmath122",
    ", our approach is to parameterize the observed spectra by fitting them with as many gaussian components as required by the data .",
    "then , components which are not obviously coming from circularly rotating gas can be discarded ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the average velocities and line widths can be computed from the remaining ones ( this is trivial if , as in the present case , only a single gaussian component is left ) . with this approach , the observed and model parameters , are compared .",
    "the advantages of our approach are twofold .",
    "firstly , much computational time is saved in computing just @xmath121 and @xmath122 instead of the whole line profile .",
    "secondly , modeling the observed emission line profiles in detail requires very high s",
    "/ n data and it is seldom possible to obtain such high quality data with hst except for a few galaxies ( e.g.  m87 , * ? ? ?",
    "even with the high s / n available from 8 m class telescopes the matching of the line profiles remains a significant problem ( e.g.  cen a , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the model @xmath121 and @xmath122 depend on @xmath124 , the intrinsic surface brightness distribution of the emission lines , and on the following parameters :    * @xmath125 , the position of the kinematical center along the slit with respect to the position of the continuum peak ; * @xmath126 , the distance between the reference slit center of the nuc slit and the kinematical center ; * @xmath93 , the inclination of the rotating disk ; * @xmath127 , the angle between the disk line of nodes and the slits ; * @xmath128 , the systemic velocity of the disk ; * @xmath120 , the mass - to - light ratio of the stellar population ; * @xmath11 , the @xmath8  mass .    not all of these parameters can be independently determined by fitting the observations .",
    "the right panel is a zoom on the nuclear disk region .",
    "the plotted model uses the mass density distribution derived from the k band light profile with the assumption of spherical symmetry .",
    "it can be inferred from the equations in appendix  [ app : gaskin ] that @xmath11 , @xmath120  and @xmath93  are directly coupled .",
    "this fact has already been discussed in detail by @xcite but here we briefly indicate how this coupling can be used to pose a lower limit on the disk inclination @xmath93 . considering the case where no @xmath8  is present",
    ", the amplitude of the rotation curves depends linearly on @xmath129 and its value can be determined by fitting the observations .",
    "therefore @xmath120  will increase with decreasing @xmath93 .",
    "an upper limit on @xmath120  can be certainly set by the largest reasonable value for a very old stellar population ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and this will immediately fix the lower limit for @xmath93 . if a @xmath8  is present , @xmath129 can still be determined from the kinematical data obtained beyond the @xmath8  sphere of influence .",
    "of course , the underlying assumption is that both @xmath120  and @xmath93  are constant .",
    "the intrinsic surface brightness distribution of emission lines @xmath124 is an important ingredient in the model computations because it is the weight in the averaging of the observed quantities .",
    "the ideal situation would be to have an emission line image with spatial resolution higher than the spectra .",
    "not having that , @xcite have used a deconvolved hst image to model their hst data .",
    "this helped them to match the microstructure of the velocity field at large radii , but it is important to remember that the information about the bh mass comes predominantly from within the central unresolved source of unknown luminosity distribution .",
    "our approach is to attempt to match the emission line fluxes as observed in the spectra ( or in emission line images ) together with a variety of synthetic realizations of this unknown central emissivity distribution .",
    "we use this to estimate its impact on the derived value of @xmath11 .",
    "thus , we assume simple analytical forms of the line flux distribution which well match the observed one along the slit , after folding with the telescope and instrument responses as described above .",
    "it is clear from the right panel in figure  [ fig : rotnuc ] that the flux distribution observed at the three slit positions is very complex and can not be described by a single radially symmetric component in the disk plane .",
    "therefore we choose the approach of modeling directly the flux distribution on the plane of the sky by exploring various simple analytical forms of the line flux distribution .",
    "we take the intrinsic light distribution at point @xmath130 in the plane of the sky in the nuc slit reference frame ( @xmath131 is the position across the nuc slit while @xmath132 is the position along it ) to be defined as @xmath133 where @xmath134 is a circularly symmetric function of characteristic radius @xmath135 and weighting factor @xmath136 .",
    "each component function @xmath134 is centered at @xmath137 , and @xmath138 is the radial distance from this location @xmath139^{0.5}$ ] .",
    "this is an approach similar to that of @xcite except that we use a synthetic realization of the line flux map .",
    "although each bright patch is assumed to be circularly symmetric , its material is in circular rotation about the galactic nucleus .",
    "hence patches are constantly shearing rather than moving as coherent units .",
    "the free parameters characterizing the flux distribution are therefore @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath136 and @xmath135 and are chosen in order to match the observed flux distribution along the slit after folding the model with telescope and instrument .",

    "as shown in the previous section , the four cases examined there cover the most extreme cases : spherical or disk - like distribution of the extended component ( @xmath101 and @xmath102 respectively ) , stellar cluster which gives a small contribution to the total stellar density distribution ( k band ) or which dominates over the nuclear disk size i.e.   @xmath194 ( i band ) .",
    "from tables  [ tab : fitstandard ] and [ tab : fitaltern ] we can conclude that the value of the @xmath8  mass or its upper limit do not depend on the assumed stellar density profile . from the same table",
    "it can be seen that the position of the nucleus along and across the slit is also independent of the assumed mass distribution . in  [ sec : stardens ] we decided not to apply a reddening correction to the light profiles because of the uncertainties involved .",
    "this reddening correction would have affected the values of the mass - to - light ratios derived from the rotation curves ( see  [ sec : modelkin ] ) whose accurate measurement is not the aim of this paper . roughly , assuming an average @xmath115 mag (  [ sec : profiles ] ) ,",
    "the i light would increase by @xmath195 and @xmath182 would decrease by the same amount ( -0.2 in log ) .",
    "the k light would similarly increase only by @xmath196 with a similar decrease in @xmath181 ( -0.04 in log ) .",
    "these corrections would have a marginal effect for the conclusions on the cluster age derived in figure [ fig : bc96 ] .",
    "finally the reddening correction effects on the shape of the stellar light / mass density profiles , would be negligible for the estimate of the @xmath8  mass upper limit .",
    "indeed , the same value is obtained regardless of the use of mass density profiles derived from the i or k band light which are very differently affected by reddening .",
    "another important issue is the influence of the intrinsic line flux distribution on @xmath11 .",
    "we have tried several other different realizations of the observed flux distribution by varying both the number of components and the functional form of single components ( exponential , gaussian , power law ) .",
    "we have found that accurately describing the observed flux distribution is important .",
    "models that did not do this produced fits significantly worse than those described in the previous section .",
    "when the fits of fluxes and velocities are acceptable , @xmath11  or its upper limit do not depend on the assumed flux distribution .",
    "the assumption of circular motions is probably one of the most critical ones .",
    "circular motions in gaseous disks are expected due to the dissipative nature of the gas , however anisotropies in the stellar potential rapidly lead to non - circular streaming ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the effect of non - circular motions would be that of `` distorting '' the rotation curves and increasing the intrinsic line width of the gas .",
    "therefore , obtaining very good fits ( @xmath197 ) of the rotation curves in the alternative model strengthens our confidence on the assumption of circular motions .",
    "this assumption is also supported by the small intrinsic line width ( @xmath198 ) required by the observations .",
    "indeed @xmath199 can be used to quantify the effects of turbulence or non - circular motions on the @xmath8  mass determination ( e.g.  @xcite ) . for the best fitting models",
    "@xmath199 is always less than 0.4 ( provided that there is s @xmath8  with a mass close to the upper limit in the case of the alternative models ) .",
    "this is similar to what @xcite found in the case of their best fit model of ngc 3245 .",
    "there the effect of the asymmetric drift correction , a possible way to include non - circular motions in the analysis ( e.g.  @xcite ) , is that to increase the estimate of the @xmath8  mass by just @xmath200 .",
    "apart from these qualitative arguments , the presence of significant non - circular motions can not be excluded and it is not possible at the moment to quantify their effects on the method we have adopted and described here .",
    "non - circular motions are certainly present in the nuclear region of ngc 4041 as indicated by the presence of the blue wing , but these have been singled out in the deblending procedure as in @xcite .",
    "a proposed explanation for the blueshift observed in the nuclear disk is that the star cluster is oscillating across the galactic plane . in this picture , the cluster is bound to the galaxy , is old and has a large @xmath120  ensuring that it is massive enough and not subjected to tidal disruption .",
    "any velocity component perpendicular to the disk will give a large contribution to the observed velocity because the galaxy is almost face - on .",
    "if the cluster is oscillating across the galactic plane , the observed blueshift may be translated into a velocity modulus of similar magnitude .",
    "thus , the cluster velocity ( @xmath201 ) is smaller than the rotational velocity ( see figure  [ fig : vels ] ) and the cluster is bound to the galaxy .",
    "if the cluster is very massive , as in the alternative model , then the gravitational potential over the star cluster size is dominated by the star cluster itself and it is not subjected to tidal disruption . also in this picture the gaseous disk is completely dominated by the gravitational potential of the star cluster .",
    "the total cluster mass within @xmath202 as derived from the i - band mass density profile ( the one in which the cluster dominates ) is @xmath203 and this gives an average density of @xmath204 , not an unusually high value , since it can be found in galactic globular clusters @xcite .    in the picture",
    "in which the cluster is young ( from the fit of the k band we have @xmath205 , i.e.  @xmath193 from figure  [ fig : bc96 ] ) , the stability against tidal disruption could pose a problem , since the mass in the nuclear region is completely dominated by the bulge stars .",
    "however , this problem could be solved if the lifetime of the cluster against tidal disruption is less than or equal to the cluster age .",
    "it is now clear that a large fraction of hot spheroids contain a @xmath8  and , moreover , it seems that the hole mass is proportional to the mass ( or luminosity ) of the host spheroid .",
    "quantitatively , @xmath15 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this relation is still controversial , however , both because the sensitivity of published searches is correlated with bulge luminosity , and because there is substantial scatter in @xmath11  at fixed @xmath17 .",
    "recently @xcite and @xcite have shown that a tighter correlation holds between the bh mass and the velocity dispersion of the bulge .",
    "the two groups however find two different slopes of the correlation , @xmath206 and @xmath207 respectively @xcite .",
    "clearly , any correlation of black hole and spheroid properties would have important implications for theories of galaxy formation in general , and bulge formation in particular .",
    "indeed , several authors have shown that the slope of the @xmath11-@xmath13  correlation yields information on the formation process . if the formation process is self - regulated , i.e.  if the bh growth is limited by radiation pressure , @xmath206 @xcite .",
    "conversely if the growth is regulated by ambient conditions @xmath207 @xcite",
    ". the uncertainties on the slope of the @xmath11-@xmath13  correlation do not allow one to distinguish between the two cases . to solve this problem more @xmath8  mass measurements are needed in the low mass range ( @xmath208-@xmath177@xmath172 ) where spiral galaxies are expected to fit .",
    "these correlations are also very important to estimate @xmath8  masses quickly and easily instead from very complex dynamical and kinematic measurements .",
    "therefore the quantities involved in the correlations must be measured as carefully as possible in order to reduce the scatter to its intrinsic value .",
    "for instance it has been shown that with careful estimates of the bulge luminosity the @xmath11-@xmath12correlation has the same scatter as the @xmath11-@xmath13  correlation , in contrast with previous claims @xcite .",
    "given the low value of the @xmath8  mass in ngc 4041 , @xmath209 , it is worthwhile to verify the relation of this galaxy with the proposed correlations . the b magnitude from the rc3 catalogue is 11.9 becoming 11.8 after extinction correction ( see ned ) .",
    "the morphological type is sbc / sc and @xmath210 . from @xcite",
    "the bulge to total luminosity ratio is @xmath211 resulting in @xmath212 .",
    "thus the bulge magnitude is 13.8 .",
    "the adopted distance , 19.5@xmath29 , corresponds to a distance modulus of 31.5 thus the absolute bulge magnitude is @xmath9 corresponding to 1.8@xmath213@xmath214 .",
    "the best fit of the @xmath215 correlation gives @xmath216 @xcite .",
    "thus the expected @xmath8  mass in ngc 4041 would be 1.2@xmath217@xmath172 , in agreement with the @xmath8  mass estimate or upper limit .",
    "the best fit of the @xmath218 correlation gives @xmath219 @xcite or @xmath220 @xcite .",
    "using integral / wyffos at the wht , we have recently measured the stellar velocity dispersion in the central 2  of ngc 4041 ( batcheldor et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "with @xmath221 , the expected @xmath8  masses are then 7@xmath222@xmath172  and 4@xmath222@xmath172 , both consistent with the result from this paper .",
    "since the main goal of our project is to determine whether or not spirals do in fact follow the @xmath11-@xmath12  and @xmath11-@xmath13  relations , it is important to observe also objects which , a - priori , are expected to have marginally or non detectable @xmath8s . indeed , even if the present measurement is only an upper limit , this is still useful in ruling out the presence of unusually massive central @xmath8s in late type spiral galaxies .",
    "we presented hst / stis spectra of the sbc spiral galaxy ngc 4041 which were used to map the velocity field of the gas in its nuclear region .",
    "we detected the presence of a compact ( @xmath0 ) , high surface brightness , circularly rotating nuclear disk cospatial with a nuclear star cluster .",
    "this disk is characterized by a rotation curve with a peak to peak amplitude of @xmath1 and is systematically blueshifted by @xmath223 with respect to the galaxy systemic velocity .",
    "we have analyzed the kinematical data assuming that the stellar mass - to - light ratio is constant with radius and that the gaseous disk is not warped , having the same inclination as the large scale galactic disk .",
    "we have found that , in order to reproduce the observed rotation curve , a dark point mass of @xmath3 is needed , very likely a supermassive @xmath8 .",
    "however the observed blueshift suggests the possibility that the nuclear disk could be dynamically independent . following this line of reasoning",
    "we have relaxed the standard assumptions varying the stellar mass - to - light and the disk inclination .",
    "we have found that the kinematical data can be accounted for by the stellar mass provided that either the mass - to - light ratio is increased by a factor of @xmath4 or the inclination is allowed to vary .",
    "this model resulted in a @xmath5 upper limit of @xmath224 on the mass of any nuclear black hole .    combining the results from the standard and alternative models ,",
    "the present data only allow us to set an upper limit of @xmath7 to the mass of the nuclear @xmath8 .",
    "if this upper limit is taken in conjunction with an estimated bulge b magnitude of @xmath9 and with a central stellar velocity dispersion of @xmath225 , the putative black hole in ngc 4041 is not inconsistent with both the @xmath11-@xmath12  and the @xmath11-@xmath13  correlations .",

    "then a given disk point @xmath239 with coordinates @xmath272 in the slit reference frame has coordinates @xmath273 in the disk reference frame given by @xmath274 if the disk has an inclination angle @xmath93   ( @xmath275 in the face - on case ) , then @xmath239 is at the disk radius @xmath276 given by @xmath277 the circular velocity of @xmath239 , in the case of a spherical mass distribution , is then given by @xmath278 where @xmath279 is the enclosed mass at radius @xmath276 , a constant value @xmath11 in case of a point mass . in the case of an oblate spheroidal mass distribution , @xmath280",

    "the light distribution can be written as @xmath282 where @xmath283 is the total intensity at the point @xmath284 , and @xmath285 is the intrinsic line profile centered at the velocity along the line of sight @xmath286 . after passing through the telescope ,",
    "the light gets convolved with the instrumental psf @xmath287 , and at point @xmath288 in the focal plane the light distribution is described by @xmath289 as already defined , the slit in the focal plane is aligned along the @xmath267 axis and let its center cross the @xmath290 axis at @xmath291 .",
    "let the slit width be @xmath292 . past the slit ,",
    "the light falls into the detector plane , where the spatial coordinate @xmath293 and the velocity @xmath294 are combined into one single detector coordinate @xmath295 , which we identify with the _ observed _ velocity ( we denote it @xmath296 here in contrast to the intrinsic velocity denoted by @xmath297 ) . here , the coefficient @xmath298 is given by @xmath299 where @xmath300 , the anamorphic magnification , accounts for the different scales on the dispersion and slit directions . in the case of stis , the scale along the slit is 005071 and along dispersion is 005477 , thus @xmath301 @xcite .",
    "the light distribution in the detector plane , @xmath302 , is calculated by ousting @xmath294 , and integrating the light contribution across the slit @xmath303 \\ ,                 i({\\ensuremath{x'}},{\\ensuremath{y'}})\\ ,                 p({\\ensuremath{x}}-{\\ensuremath{x'}},{\\ensuremath{y}}-{\\ensuremath{y ' } } ) .",

    "properties of thus defined two - dimensional light distribution with the spurious velocity shift were investigated in detail by @xcite .",
    "the detector integrates over finite pixel sizes therefore we calculate the expected line fluxes , average velocities and widths for the line profile that is obtained by integrating the light distribution on the detector plane @xmath302 over the width @xmath305 of the @xmath306 pixel along the slit , and convolving it with the shape of the pixel in the dispersion direction : a top - hat of width @xmath307 .",
    "thus the expected line profile in the detector is @xmath308 where the @xmath306 pixel has the coordinate @xmath309 along the slit .",
    "note that the observed intensities are measured at discrete values of @xmath296 corresponding to the pixel centers . in order to calculate the expected line fluxes , average velocities and widths",
    ", one has to evaluate moments of @xmath310 : @xmath311 where we used abbreviations @xmath312 and @xmath313 .",
    "the last two integrals can be simplified by inverting the order of integration : @xmath314 @xmath315 where @xmath316 is 1 for @xmath317 and 0 otherwise .",
    "this leads to the following formulae for the moments of @xmath310 : @xmath318 @xmath319 @xmath320 to obtain them , we assumed that the intrinsic velocity profile @xmath321 is bound and symmetric , i.e.   @xmath322 where @xmath323 is the intrinsic velocity dispersion .",
    "equations  [ eq : intens ] , [ eq : veloc ] and [ eq : veloc2 ] can be used to compute the expected line fluxes , average velocities and widths .",
    "for example , in the most simple case of a constant line intensity @xmath324 , and velocity field @xmath325 , one can write : @xmath326",
    "then the expected velocity dispersion , given by @xmath327 , is , understandably , larger than the intrinsic velocity dispersion @xmath122 .",
    "this is due to the convolution with the pixel size and slit width , which add quadratically .",
    "however , note that while @xmath328 and @xmath122 enter the integral ( [ eq : veloc2 ] ) as constants , @xmath329 is a linear combination of the spurious velocity shift , and the intrinsic velocity .",
    "these two contributions can cancel , resulting in the expected line profile being broadened by the pixel size only , and not by the width of the slit .",
    "this implies that the wide slit can probe the disk on the scale of the pixel size rather than the slit width .",

    "here , @xmath331 is the spatial r.m.s . of the point spread function ( psf ) and @xmath332",
    "is the subsampling factor .",
    "we have verified that the optimal subsampling factor used is @xmath333 since larger values do not produce any appreciable differences in the final results .",

    "algorithm @xcite . following @xcite we have also introduced the ccd scattering function @xcite but , as already noticed by them , it does not have any appreciable effect in the final results .",
    "we compare models to the observed spectrum , which is essentially an array of intensities @xmath334 , after the observed line profile is derived in the following way : to the sequence of intensities @xmath334 for a given row @xmath335 along the slit , we fit a baseline , and a continuous analytical function @xmath336 , which we interpret as the observed equivalent of the expected line profile @xmath337 ( eq.[eq : lprofile ] ) .",
    "the best fitting model is determined by minimizing the reduced @xmath251 defined as : @xmath338\\ ] ] where the index @xmath339 indicates the slit position , and @xmath340 counts pixels along the slit . here , the characteristics of the model are as follows .",
    "the velocity in the @xmath306 row along the slit @xmath341 , and the fwhm of the velocity profile @xmath342 , are calculated directly from equations ( [ eq : vel ] ) , now clearly for variable intensity and velocity field .",
    "they both are functions of @xmath227 free parameters @xmath258 , which are determined by @xmath343 minimization .",
    "the fwhm is calculated from the expected velocity dispersion @xmath344 after assuming a gaussian line profile .",
