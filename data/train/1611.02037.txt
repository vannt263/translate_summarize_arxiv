    "this allows to change the number of electrons @xmath62 in the quantum dots and transfer between different charge configurations @xmath63 with the total number of electrons @xmath64 .",
    "the dynamics of the system is described by the time dependent schrdinger equation @xmath65 with the hubbard hamiltonian ( [ modelhubbardept ] ) and the doublet base given by ( [ psi ] ) .",
    "the equation ( [ schrodinger ] ) neglects decoherence and relaxation processes which can be caused by e.g. a charge noise or spin - flip precesses .",
    "the charge noises are related with fluctuations of a local electrical potential in the quantum dot confinement and tunnel barriers .",
    "the corresponding decoherence time can be of the order of microseconds @xcite . in the system connected to external electrodes one can observe charge fluctuations as well as spin  flip processes ( with the relaxation time around 100 ns @xcite ) .",
    "we show later that the equation ( [ schrodinger ] ) very well describes dynamics of the system if the speed rate is taken reasonable large and the time of the qubit generation is much shorter than the relaxation and decoherence times .",
    "we are interested in the l  z transition between the charge configurations ( 2,1,0 ) to ( 1,1,1 ) when the qubit states @xmath31 and @xmath32 are generated .",

    "we showed that in this case the state @xmath32 is preferred , the generated qubit is restricted to the south part of the bloch sphere only . for si - based quantum dots",
    "@xcite the estimated sweep time @xmath95 for the generation of the qubit is of the order of a few nanoseconds which is much shorter than both the decoherence and relaxation time .",

    "the symmetry was changed by a rotation of the effective electric field ( controlled by the local gate potentials applied to the quantum dots ) .",

    "the interested case is the triangular tqd with one of the dots smaller for which an additional anticrossing point between the qubit states occurs .",
    "we showed that the l  z passage through this point generates the rabi oscillations .",

    "one can perform the pauli x and z gate which give full unitary control of the qubit rotation on the bloch sphere @xcite .",
    "our calculations showed that the dynamics of the qubit should be observable in an experiment on si - based quantum dots even in the presence of the decoherence processes for reasonable transition speeds .",
    "the triangular tqd system can be used for construction of a multi - qubit quantum register with fast quantum logical operations . changing the symmetry of each qubit one can easily encode a desire initial state in the register . for the linear tqd",
    "the encoding operation is more complex , because one should perform an additional single - qubit gate in order to rotate the qubit states , which significantly increases the operation time .",
