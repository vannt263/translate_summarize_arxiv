    "biological membranes are fluid bilayers made primarily of lipid molecules @xcite . from a hydrodynamic point of view",
    "such a bilayer is a quasi - two - dimensional ( quasi-2d ) viscous liquid , whose molecules are constrained to flow along the 2d membrane surface while exchanging momentum not only among themselves but also with the surrounding three - dimensional ( 3d ) solvent .",
    "biomembranes contain also a high concentration of embedded inclusions  integral proteins and possibly also nanometer - scale domains  which perform key biological functions and are typically much larger than the lipids @xcite .",
    "thus , from the same coarse - grained perspective , a biomembrane can be viewed as a quasi-2d suspension @xcite .",
    "we have recently used this perspective to investigate the correlated motion of proteins in a membrane freely floating in an unbounded liquid , and how the inclusions affect the response of such a membrane to stresses @xcite . in many practical circumstances , however , the membrane is not free but attached to a solid substrate , such as the elastic scaffold of the cytoskeleton or an external surface to which a cell adheres .",
    "additionally , in various experiments membranes are more easily studied when supported by a solid substrate .",
    "the aim of the current work , therefore , is to explore how the results of ref.@xcite are modified by the presence of such a nearby immobile surface .",
    "two major approaches to the hydrodynamics of free membranes have been presented .",
    "the first , by saffman and delbrck ( sd ) @xcite , models the membrane as a viscous liquid slab of width @xmath2 and viscosity @xmath3 , having no - slip contacts at its bounding surfaces with two semi - infinite fluids of viscosity @xmath4 . the second , by levine et al .",
    "@xcite , considers the membrane as a vanishingly thin viscoelastic film embedded in an infinite viscous fluid .",
    "the dynamics of membranes embedded in a 3d fluid have been studied also using computer simulations @xcite .",
    "the common key feature of these theories is the fact that the membrane does not conserve momentum in 2d , while the total momentum is conserved in 3d .",
    "consequently , a length scale @xmath5 emerges , characterizing the crossover from a 2d - like membrane response , where stresses dominantly propagate through the membrane , to a 3d - like response , where the outer fluid governs the dynamics .",
    "this length is determined by the ratio between the 2d viscosity of the membrane and the 3d viscosity of the surrounding fluid @xcite . for lipid bilayers @xmath5",
    "is typically two to three orders of magnitude larger than the membrane thickness @xmath2 , i.e. , of micron scale .",
    "the work of ref .",
    "@xcite is an extension of the sd theory to cases with more than one inclusion , where there are three lengths to consider : the lateral size ( radius ) @xmath6 of the inclusion , the sd length @xmath5 , and the distance @xmath1 between the inclusions .",
    "the analysis was restricted to the limit @xmath7 , where complications related to specific details of the inclusions @xcite are immaterial .",
    "we employ the same assumption in most of the current work as well .",
    "the introduction of an immobile surface breaks the translational symmetry in the directions parallel to the membrane and , hence , qualitatively changes the hydrodynamics of the system as its total momentum is no longer conserved @xcite .",
    "models appropriate for such a scenario can be divided into two groups .",
    "the first @xcite adopts a phenomenological approach , describing the membrane as a 2d brinkman fluid @xcite , i.e. , introducing a term in the 2d hydrodynamic equation for the membrane , which leaks momentum at a certain fixed rate @xmath8 ( @xmath9 being the 2d kinematic viscosity of the membrane and @xmath10 its 2d mass density ) .",
    "this sets a phenomenological screening length , @xmath11 , beyond which momentum is lost to the substrate . in the second approach @xcite the additional length scale",
    "is explicitly determined by the thickness @xmath12 of a fluid layer separating the membrane from the solid substrate .",
    "when fluid exists only between the membrane and the substrate ( as in the case of a supported lipid monolayer ) @xcite , or when the membrane lies at the midplane between two substrates @xcite , the large - distance effects converge to those of the phenomenological , brinkman - like approach in the limit @xmath13 ( i.e. , for @xmath12 much smaller than a micron ) .",
    "the momentum screening length thus obtained is the geometrical mean of the other two lengths , @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the current work extends the analysis of refs.@xcite to the realistic scenario of a supported membrane with fluid on both sides , containing more than one inclusion . in sec .",
    "[ sec_model ] we define the model and present the results for the hydrodynamics of a supported membrane , which will be useful for our analysis . because of the three length scales in the model",

    "these results are used in sec.[sec_diffusion ] to calculate the coupling diffusion coefficients of pairs of inclusions , which should be directly measurable in particle - tracking experiments .",
    "we proceed in secs.[sec_effective ] and [ sec_corrected ] to examine the effect of a finite concentration of inclusions on the response of the supported membrane to stresses ( i.e. , the effective viscosity of the membrane ) and the resulting corrections to the coupling diffusion coefficients . in the practically useful limit of @xmath13",

    "the sd length is defined as @xmath16 in the slab are rigid inclusions of radius @xmath6 .",
    "although they are depicted as cylinders , their exact shape does not affect most of our analysis ; in points where it does , this will be explicitly mentioned .",

    "our goal is to characterize the response of the inclusion - decorated membrane to stresses and relate it to the coupled motions of two inclusions . a common way to characterize the membrane response as",
    "a fluid medium is through the velocity green s function , @xmath17 .",

    "we identify the tensor multiplying @xmath20 in eq.([diskdipole ] ) with the coupling mobility of two different particles  one of radius @xmath160 at the origin and another of vanishing radius , @xmath164 , at @xmath19 . due to the symmetry of the coupling mobility",

    "yet , the latter is the velocity acquired by a particle of radius @xmath160 as it is embedded in a flow caused by a mass dipole of strength @xmath159 .",
    "all we need to do now to get the velocity of a disk of radius @xmath160 due to a force @xmath20 exerted on a sufficiently distant disk of radius @xmath165 is to increase the mass - dipole strength at the origin from @xmath159 up to @xmath166 , the effective mass dipole created by @xmath20 when it is applied to a particle of radius @xmath165 .",

    "( [ dlt_hs ] ) ] is recovered . in the opposite limit of large inclusions , @xmath174 , and",

    "interestingly , the results for very large inclusions are again independent of particle size and shape .",
    "we return to this surprising finding in the next section .",
    "the aim of this work has been to characterize supported membranes as effective heterogeneous fluids .",
    "the existence of several length scales in the problem leads to various regimes that are governed by different physical mechanisms and exhibit different effective dimensionality ( either 2d or 3d ) ; see table [ tab_regime ] .",
    "we have provided predictions for the coupling diffusion coefficients of inclusion pairs in those various regimes , as well as their leading dependence on the concentration of inclusions in the membrane .",
    "these predictions can be directly checked in two - point microrheology experiments using eq .",
    "( [ fluct ] ) .",
    "since the sd length , @xmath5 , is typically of micron scale , common supported membranes should belong in the adsorbed regime , @xmath177 , which is treated in secs .",
    "[ sec_diffusion_a ] and [ sec_corrected_a ] . moreover , the limit of small inclusion size , assumed in those sections , should be generally valid , since the requirement is that @xmath6 be much smaller than @xmath14 rather than the stricter condition @xmath178 .",
    "hence , we expect this limit to hold for common membrane inclusions even in cases where the distance to the substrate is of the order of the inclusion size ( say , a few nm only ) . in this common scenario of @xmath179",
    "the substrate is predicted to strongly suppress the large - distance correlations as compared to a free membrane . comparing the results of sec .",

    "nonetheless , the correlations always remain long - ranged , their fastest possible decay being as @xmath0 .    for nm - scale separation between membrane and substrate , which is comparable to the membrane thickness",
    ", the substrate may affect the membrane properties .",
    "as long as the membrane remains fluid , such interactions are expected to merely modify the effective membrane viscosity , and the theory presented here should remain valid .",
    "a more serious concern is the possible breakdown of the bilayer description as a uniform slab , which is inherent in the saffman - delbrck model and the current work . at sufficient proximity to the surface",
    "the dynamics of the two membrane leaflets might decouple .",
    "this will occur when the friction between the lower leaflet and the solid surface exceeds the one between the two leaflets .",

    "thus , for all relevant separations @xmath12 , relative motion of the leaflets should not play a significant role , and the bilayer can be considered as a single fluid medium",
    ".    there may be cases where the inclusion size is comparable to or larger than @xmath11  for example , when the inclusion is a colloid particle or a membrane domain .",
    "we have presented expressions for the large - distance coupling coefficients in this case as well ( sec .   [ sec_large ] ) .",
    "these results have been derived for the specific case of disklike inclusions , yet in both limits of small and large @xmath187 they become independent of the size and shape of the inclusions .",
    "the origin of this surprising universality is that , in the adsorbed regime , the membrane responds to any size and shape of perturbation sufficiently far away , as if the perturbation were a mass dipole .",
    "the ` effective inclusion '  i.e. , the region around the perturbation whose dynamics determines the strength of that mass dipole  is limited in both cases of very small and very large @xmath6 by the momentum decay length @xmath11 .    concerning the effective response of the supported membrane as a function of the area fraction of inclusions",
    ", we have found that the membrane viscosity is modified according to the law for 2d suspensions @xcite , @xmath188 , yet this modification should be included also in the parameters @xmath69 and @xmath189 [ eq .   ( [ transformation ] ) ] .",
    "the combined effect is that there is _ no _ renormalization of the large - distance membrane response with increasing @xmath101 .",
    "the underlying physics is that transverse momentum is not transferred through the membrane over large distances and , hence , the response is insensitive to changes in the membrane viscosity .",
    "this insensitivity holds already for distances much smaller than the largest length scale in the problem at hand . for the common , adsorbed regime ,",
