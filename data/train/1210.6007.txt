    "we remark that it continues to be asymptotic to the evolving cylinder , which collapses in finite time .",

    "is based on the observation that powers of the height function can be used to localize derivative estimates in space .",
    "then the result follows by applying these estimates to approximate solutions and employing an arzel - ascoli - type theorem to pass to a limit .",
