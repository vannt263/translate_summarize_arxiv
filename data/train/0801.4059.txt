    "the saddle point passage problem is of great interest in various fields of physics , such as collision of molecular systems , atomic clusters , biomolecules , and so on .",
    "the previous studies on this issue were mostly concentrated on a simple diffusive dynamics with single degree of freedom , where the langevin equation with constant coefficients can be easily solved in the case of a quadratic potential @xcite .",
    "however , since many processes obviously involve more than one degree of freedom , which the one - dimensional ( 1d ) model does not distinctly hold , high dimension at least two dimension ( 2d ) is necessary .",
    "a case in point would be the fusion reaction of massive nuclei , where the fusion is induced by diffusion @xcite and the asymmetrical or the neck degree of freedom of compound nuclei needs to be considered @xcite .",
    "for these systems with the contact point of two colliding nuclei being very close to the conditional saddle point , the potential energy surface ( pes ) around the saddle point can be approximated to be a quadratic type . under this approximation ,",
    "abe _ et al . _",
    "@xcite obtained an analytical expression for the multi - dimensional saddle - point passing probability .",
    "some authors discussed quantum effect of the fusion probability by using the real time path integral @xcite or the quantum transport equation @xcite , respectively .",
    "@xcite studied the influence of initial distribution upon the passing probability .",
    "anomalous diffusion passing over the saddle point of 1d quadratic potential was also discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . nevertheless , it is not completely clear for the dynamical role of non - transport degrees of freedom",
    ". this might be very important for the quasi - fission mechanism in the fusion reaction , because the average path of the fusing system in a multi - dimensional pes should be controlled by the off - diagonal components of inertia and friction tensors before the system arrives firstly at the conditional saddle point .",
    "recently , theoretical calculations for the fusion barrier distribution , accounting for the surface curvature correction to the nuclear potential , have been presented by hinde _",
    "et al_. @xcite .",
    "the geometrical effect significantly changes the near - barrier fusion cross section and the shape of the barrier distribution through an angle - dependent potential , where the target nucleus bears quadrupole and bexadecapole deformations while the projectile one is in a spherical shape . in these calculations ,",
    "the surface curvature correction to the sphere - to - sphere nuclear potential exerts influences upon the fusion probability through the height of fusion barrier .",
    "however , the dynamical coupling effect of various deformative degrees of freedom needs to be added from the viewpoint of fusion by diffusion @xcite .",
    "the primary purpose of this paper is to study the influence of coupling between two degrees of freedom upon the passing probability . in sec .",
    "ii , we report the analytical expression of the saddle - point passing probability by solving the 2d coupled langevin equation with constant coefficients . in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss the effects of off - diagonal components of inertia , friction and potential - curvature tensors and then determine the optimal diffusive path .",
    "iv gives an application of this study to the actual fusion process of massive nuclei .",

    "we consider the directional diffusion of a particle in a 2d quadratic pes : @xmath0 with @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the motion of the particle is described by the langevin equation @xmath3 with @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 . here and below the einstein summation convention",

    "the critical velocity is defined by the passing probability being equal to @xmath44 .",
    "this leads to the condition : @xmath45 . if all the off - diagonal components of the three coefficient tensors are not considered , as well as @xmath46 and @xmath47 are taken to be zero , the critical velocity is determined from eq .",

    "quantities plotted in the figures 1 - 7 are dimensionless and @xmath56 except for the units having been included in the figure caption . in fig . 1 , we plot the critical velocity and the stationary passing probability as functions of the off - diagonal components of three coefficient tensors , where one of off - diagonal components varies and the other two are fixed to be zero . the stationary passing probability is calculated by @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "it is shown that the critical velocity increases with increasing the absolute value of @xmath58 or @xmath33 ; while decreases with the increase of @xmath59 .",
    "the larger critical velocity of a system needs , the more difficult for the particle is to arrive at the potential top .",
    "this also implies that the passing probability is small when the dissipation along the diffusive path is large if the potential differences between the saddle point and the initial positions are equivalent .",

    "it is seen that the maximum of the passing probability does not appear in the vertical case ( @xmath61 ) . in the 2d pes ,",
    "the particle is usually supposed to travel along the potential valley and then the steepest decedent direction . because this is the direction which faces a smaller potential barrier .",
    "however , it may not be a path with a weaker damping . under the effect of the off - diagonal component of the friction tensor",
    ", the particle is forced to select a better path with both low potential barrier and weak friction to surmount the saddle point of the potential .      , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 , as well as",
    "the other parameters are used as those in the figure 1 . ]",
    "where is the optimal incident direction which enables the particle with given initial kinetic energy to have a larger passing probability ? in order to determine this direction , we need to choose a special angle @xmath64 which enables the critical velocity to reach its minimum , i.e. , from eq .",
    "( 7 ) , @xmath65 in fact , the largest analytically root of @xmath50 dominantly determines the passing probability . the optimal incident angle @xmath64",
    "can then be expressed by the langevin coefficients as @xmath66 using the same parameters as those written in figs . 1 and 3 ,",

    "it is illustrated that the direction of the optimal path departs from the @xmath13-direction .",
    "the effect of off - diagonal component of the inertia tensor makes the average path of the diffusive system turn toward the positive @xmath78-axis , while the off - diagonal component of friction leads the mean path of the particle toward the negative @xmath78-axis . finally , the competition of these two effects results in the optimal diffusive path shown in fig . 4 ( b ) .",
    "this phenomenon is similar to the quasi - stationary flow passing over the barrier in the fission case @xcite , where the magnitude of the current is strongly influenced by the off - diagonal components of inertia and friction tensors .     for various @xmath46 . here",

    "figure 5 shows the dependence of the stationary passing probability on the incident angle of the particle starting from various initial positions but with fixed initial kinetic energy .",
    "it is seen that the passing probability of the particle starting from a large positive @xmath46 position is larger than that of starting from both small and negative @xmath46 positions.this is because the energy difference between the potential top and the initial position of the particle is small for the former .",

    "( 7 ) : @xmath90 when @xmath87 ; @xmath91 when @xmath86 , for @xmath79 and @xmath40 .",
    "hence the stationary passing probability of the particle starting from @xmath87 is larger than that of the particle starting from @xmath86 . in particular , under the present circumstance , the diffusive process of the particle with different incident angles shows an interesting behavior .",
    "because the initial velocity of the particle along the @xmath13-direction for @xmath40 is larger than that of @xmath85 rad , the former can move to a position being closer to the saddle point than the latter .",
    "thus the passing probability for @xmath40 is larger than that of @xmath85 rad at the beginning .",
    "however , the width of the gaussian distribution is independent of the incident angle and increases with the increase of time .",
    "although the center position of the particle s distribution with @xmath85 rad is behind that of @xmath40 , as the time goes on , it will have a lager share of distribution passed the saddle point .",
    "therefore , the passing probability for a particle with incident angle @xmath85 rad is larger than that of @xmath40 in the long time .",
    "time - dependent passing probabilities shown in figs .",

    "it is found a highlighted interesting result from fig . 8",
    "that there exists the optimal collision shape for projectile and target nuclei , which induces the maximum fusion probability under the same center - of - mass energy .",
    "it can be easily understood from a combining role of the off - diagonal components of three dynamical coefficient tensors .",
    "this concludes that the fusion probability of massive nuclei can be enhanced if the two collision heavy ions are polarized to be ellipsoid and the collision direction between the long and short axis of ellipsoid is appropriately selected . for the fusion of deformed massive nuclei",
    ", there exists the optimal angle for the incident nucleus to collide with the target one , which favors the fusion of heavy ions to be accomplished .",
    "figure 9 shows the fusion probability of @xmath92 as a function of the center - of - mass energy when the off - diagonal components are considered partly . here the initial position of the fusing system is chosen into the optimal one , i.e. , @xmath117 and @xmath118 as well as all the parameters used are the same as the figure 8 .",
    "this fusion reaction system is regarded as an example to compare the results with and without off - diagonal components in the potential surface , friction and mass parameters , which is reflected in the result presented in the above section .",
    "in fact , the case of without all off - diagonal components is equivalent to the one dimension or without the neck situation @xcite .",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "9 that the increase of the 1d fusion probability curve versus the energy is faster than that of 2d case .",
    "it has been known that the pervious 1d diffusion model without the neck variable proposed the fusion probability larger than the experimental data , so the present completely coupled 2d diffusion model might be appropriate . moreover ,",
    "the results for the presence of only one of three off - diagonal components can also be understood from the critical velocity ( kinetic energy ) , to see fig .",
    "namely , the larger the critical kinetic energy of the system is , the less the fusion probability is for the same center - of - mass energy .",
    "the nonvanishing @xmath32 allows the smallest critical kinetic energy and the presence of @xmath58 leads to the largest critical kinetic energy .",

    "the expression of the passing probability is obtained analytically , where the inertia and friction tensors are not diagonal .",
    "the optimal incident angle of the particle s initial velocity is determined .",
    "our results have shown that the optimal diffusive path , which departs from the potential valley in the two - dimensional potential energy surface , induces the maximum saddle - point passing probability .",

    "we have investigated the fusion probability of massive nuclei and compared the results with and without off - diagonal terms , for instance , the reaction of @xmath92 . due to the influences of off - diagonal components of inertia and friction upon the diffusive path , which are calculated by the @xmath120 parametrization , the fusion probability can be enhanced for an appropriate choice of the collision direction of the deformable target and projectile nuclei .",
