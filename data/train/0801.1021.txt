    "in five dimensions , the most general theory of gravity leading to second order field equations for the metric is the so called einstein - gauss - bonnet ( egb ) theory , which contains quadratic powers of the curvature .",

    "the study of black holes with higher derivative curvature in anti - de sitter ( ads ) spaces has been considered by many authors in the recent years .",
    "static ads black hole solutions in egb gravity are known in closed form , presenting a number of interesting features ( see @xmath0 @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the references therein ) .",

    "the authors of @xcite discussed some properties of a particular set of asymptotically ads@xmath1 @xmath2 rotating solutions in egb theory with one nonvanishing angular momentum ( where the rotation parameter appears as a small quantity ) , the effects of an u(1 ) field being also included .    the main purpose of this work is to present numerical evidence for the existence of a different class of rotating solutions in @xmath3 egb theory with negative cosmological constant , approaching asymptotically an ads spacetime background .",
    "these solutions are found within a nonperturbative approach , by directly solving the egb equations with suitable boundary conditions .",
    "they posses a regular horizon of spherical topology and have two equal magnitude angular momenta .",
    "this leads to a system of coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations ( odes ) , which are solved numerically .",
    "the same approach has been employed recently to construct einstein - maxwell rotating black hole solutions in higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "we consider the egb action with a negative cosmological constant @xmath4 @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the ricci scalar and @xmath7 is the gauss - bonnet term .",
    "the variation of the action ( [ action ] ) with respect to the metric tensor results in the equations of the model @xmath8 where @xmath9 for a well - defined variational principle , one has to supplement the action ( [ action ] ) with the gibbons - hawking surface term @xmath10 and its counterpart for the gauss - bonnet gravity @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the induced metric on the boundary , @xmath13 is the trace of the extrinsic curvature of the boundary , @xmath14 is the einstein tensor of the metric @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the trace of the tensor @xmath17    to compute the conserved charges of the asymptotically ads solutions in egb gravity , we use the approach proposed by balasubramanian and kraus in @xcite .",
    "this technique was inspired by ads / cft correspondence and consists in adding suitable counterterms @xmath18 to the action of the theory in order to ensure the finiteness of the boundary stress tensor @xmath19 derived by the quasilocal energy definition @xcite",
    ".    therefore we supplement the general action ( which contains the surface terms for einstein and gauss - bonnet gravity ) with the following boundary counterterm @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the curvature scalar associated with the induced metric @xmath22 ( see also @xcite for previous work on boundary conterterm technique in egb gravity , applied to non - rotating solutions ) .",

    "the formalism proposed in section 2 to compute the mass , angular momentum and entropy of ads solutions should apply in the general case , too .",
    "rotating topological black holes in egb theory with an horizon of negative curvature are also likely to exist for @xmath157 .",
    "the study of the solutions discussed in this paper in an ads / cft context is an interesting open question .",
    "according to the ads / cft correspondence , the higher derivatives curvature terms can be viewed as the corrections of large @xmath158 expansion of the boundary cft in the strong coupling limit . for the ansatz considered here , the boundary metric is not rotating and corresponds to a static einstein universe in four dimensions .",
    "here it is interesting to note that , similar to the @xmath48 case , the stress - energy tensor for the dual theory defined in that background , as computed according to the standard prescription @xcite , is traceless .    a detailed study of the @xmath3 rotating black hole solutions in egb theory together with a discussion of their asymptotically flat limit will be presented elsewhere . +   + * acknowledgements * + y. b. thanks the belgian fnrs for financial support .",
    "+   + _ note added : _ when this work has been at final stages , the authors of @xcite appear to have succeeded in constructing a kerr black hole in egb theory in @xmath3 dimensions .",
    "however , this result needs an independant confirmation .",
