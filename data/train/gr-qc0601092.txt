    "generalized uncertainty principle is a common feature of all promising candidates of quantum gravity .",
    "string theory , loop quantum gravity and noncommutative geometry(with deeper insight to the nature of spacetime at planck scale ) , all indicate the modification of standard heisenberg principle [ 1 - 10 ] . recently it has been indicated that within quantum gravity scenarios , a modification of dispersion relation(relation between energy and momentum of a given particle ) is unavoidable[11 - 13 ] . there are some conceptual relations between gup and mdrs .",
    "these possible relations have been studied recently[14,15 ] .",
    "these quantum gravity effects , in spite of being small , are important since they can modify experimental results .",
    "there are several efforts to provide experimental evidence of these small effects .",
    "for example , amelino - camelia _ et al _ , by investigation of potential sensitivity of gamma - ray burster observations to wave dispersion in vacuo , have outlined aspects of an observational programme that could address possible detection of these quantum gravity effects[16 ] .",
    "amelino - camelia and piran have argued that planck - scale deformation of lorentz symmetry can be a solution to the ultra high energy cosmic rays(uhecr ) with energies above the gzk threshold and the tev-@xmath0 paradoxes[17 ] .",
    "gambini and pullin have studied light propagation in the picture of semi - classical spacetime that emerges in canonical quantum gravity in the loop representation[18 ] .",
    "they have argued that in such a picture , where space - time exhibits a polymer - like structure at microscales , it is natural to expect departures from the perfect non - dispersiveness of ordinary vacuum .",
    "they have evaluated these departures by computing the modifications to maxwell s equations due to quantum gravity , and showing that under certain circumstances , non - vanishing corrections appear that depend on the helicity of propagating waves .",
    "these effects could lead to observable cosmological predictions of the discrete nature of quantum spacetime .",
    "then , they have addressed to observations of non - dispersiveness in the spectra of gamma - ray bursts at various energies to constrain the type of semi - classical state that describes the universe .",
    "et al _ have shown that threshold effects and planck scale lorentz violation are combined constraints from high energy astrophysics[19 ] .",
    "these literatures provide possible experimental schemes for detection of small quantum gravity effects . however , there are two extreme domains : black hole structure and early stages of the universe evolution where these quantum gravity effects are dominant .",
    "corrections to black hole thermodynamics due to quantum gravitational effects of minimal length and gup have been studied extensively(see [ 20 ] and references therein ) . on the other hand , part of the thermodynamical implications of gup and mdr",
    "have been studied by amelino - camelia _ et al_[21 ] and nozari _",
    "et al_[22 ] .",
    "thermodynamics of early universe within standard heisenberg principle has been studied by rahvar _",
    "et al_[23 ] .",
    "since quantum gravitational effects are very important in early stages of the universe evolution , it is natural to investigate early universe thermodynamics within gup and mdrs frameworks .",
    "here we are going to formulate thermodynamics of ultra - relativistic particles in early universe within gup and mdrs frameworks . in the first step , using gup as our primary input , we calculate thermodynamical properties of ultra - relativistic particles in early universe . in formulation of the early universe thermodynamics within gup framework , due to limitations imposed on the measurement processes , two main points should be considered : first due to casual structure of spacetime , maximum distance for causal relation is particle horizon radius and secondly , there is a minimum momentum imposed by gup which restricts the minimum value of energy . in the next step , for a general gaseous system composed of ultra - relativistic particles ,",
    "we find density of states using mdrs with bose - einstein or fermi - dirac statistics and then thermodynamics of the system will be followed . in each step",
    "we discuss ordinary limits of our equations and we compare consequences of two approaches .",
    "emergence of the generalized uncertainty principle can be motivated and finds support in the direct analysis of any quantum gravity scenario .",
    "this means that gup itself is a model independent concept .",
    "generally , gup can be written as[24 ] @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath0 are positive and independent of @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( but may in general depend on the expectation values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) .",
    "this gup leads to a nonzero minimal uncertainty in both position and momentum for positive @xmath2 and @xmath3[24 ] .",
    "if we set @xmath8 we find @xmath9 since we are going to deal with absolutely smallest uncertainties , we set @xmath10 from now on .",
    "so we find @xmath11 this relation leads to a nonzero minimal observable length of the order of planck length , @xmath12 .",
    "any position measurement in quantum gravity has at least @xmath13 as its lower limit of position uncertainty .",
    "this relation has an immediate consequence for the rest of statistical mechanics : it modifies the _ fundamental volume @xmath14 _ of accessible phase space for representative points . in ordinary statistical mechanics , it is impossible to define the position of a representative point in the phase space of the given system more accurately than the situation which is given by @xmath15 . in another words , around any point @xmath16 of the ( two dimensional ) phase space , there exists an area of the order @xmath17 which the position of the representative point can not be pin - pointed . in ordinary statistical mechanics we have the following definition of fundamental volume @xmath18 since in quantum gravity era @xmath19 , we can interpret equation ( 3 ) as a generalization of @xmath17 , @xmath20 therefore , we find the following generalization of the fundamental volume @xmath21^{3n}\\equiv ( \\hbar_{eff})^{3n}.\\ ] ] since the total number of microstates is given by @xmath22 ( here @xmath23 is the volume of the accessible phase space ) , we see that gup leads to a reduction of accessible microstates and therefore a reduction of entropy . in other words , when we approaches planck scale regime with high energy and momentum particles , the volume of the fundamental cell increases in such away that eventually the number of microstates tends to unity and therefore entropy vanishes .",
    "this is a novel prediction of quantum gravity .",
    "recently we have calculated microcanonical entropy of an ideal gaseous system and we have observed an unusual thermodynamics of systems in very short distances or equivalently very high energy regime[22 ] .",
    "+ another consequence of gup in the form of relation ( 3 ) , has been formulated by kempf _",
    "et al_[24 ] .",
    "they have shown that within the momentum representation , the generalization of the scalar products reads @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are momentum space state functions .",
    "for ultra - relativistic particles with @xmath27 , we should consider the following generalization @xmath28 where we have set @xmath29 .",
    "+ on the other hand , if we set @xmath30 in ( 1 ) , we find @xmath31 where for positive @xmath2 leads to nonzero minimal uncertainty in momentum .",
    "this statement leads to a space - dependent generalization of @xmath17 .",
    "this type of generalization has nothing to do with dynamics and there is no explicit physical interpretation of it at least up to now .",
    "+ from another perspective , in scenarios which consider spacetime foam intuition in the study of quantum gravity phenomena , emergence of modified dispersion relations takes place naturally[25 ] . as a consequence ,",
    "wave dispersion in the spacetime foam might resemble wave dispersion in other media .",
    "since planck length fundamentally set the minimum allowed value for wavelengths , a modified dispersion relation can also be favored .",
    "recently it has been shown that a modified energy - momentum dispersion relation can also be introduced as an observer - independent law[26 ] . in this case",
    ", the planckian minimum - wavelength hypothesis can be introduced as a physical law valid in every frame .",
    "therefore , the analysis of some quantum - gravity scenarios has shown some explicit mechanisms for the emergence of modified dispersion relations .",
    "for example , in the framework of noncommutative geometry and loop quantum gravity approaches this modified dispersion relations have been motivated(see for example[21 ] and references therein ) . in most cases one is led to consider a dispersion relation of the type(note that from now on we set @xmath32 ) @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the function that gives the exact dispersion relation , and on the right - hand side we have assumed the applicability of a taylor - series expansion for @xmath35 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath36 can take different values in different quantum - gravity proposals . note that @xmath37 is the rest energy of the particle and the mass parameter @xmath38 on the right - hand side is directly related to the rest energy , but @xmath39 if the @xmath36 do not all vanish . since we are working in planck regime where the rest mass is much smaller than the particle kinetic energy , there is no risk of confusing between @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "while in the parametrization of ( 3 ) we have included a possible correction term suppressed only by one power of the planck length , in gup such a linear - in-@xmath40 term is assumed not to be present .",
    "for the mdr a large number of alternative formulations , including some with the linear - in-@xmath40 term , are being considered , as they find support in different approaches to the quantum - gravity problem , whereas all the discussions of a gup assume that the leading - order correction should be proportional to the square of @xmath40 ( as has been indicated by amelino - camelia _ et al_[21 ] , linear - in-@xmath40 term in mdr has no support in string theory analysis of black holes entropy - area relation and therefore it seems that this term should not be present in mdr .",
    "recently we have shown that coefficients of all odd power of @xmath41 in mdr should be zero[15 ] ) .",
    "+ within quantum field theory , the relation between particle localization and its energy is given by @xmath42 , where @xmath4 is particle position uncertainty .",
    "it is obvious that due to both gup and mdr this relation should be modified . in a simple analysis based on the familiar derivation of the relation @xmath42[27 ] ,",
    "one can obtain the corresponding generalized relation .",
    "since we need this generalization in forthcoming arguments , we give a brief outline of its derivation here .",
    "we focus on the case of a particle of mass @xmath43 at rest , whose position is being measured by a procedure involving a collision with a photon of energy @xmath44 and momentum @xmath45 . according to heisenberg s uncertainty principle , in order to measure the particle position with precision @xmath4",
    ", one should use a photon with momentum uncertainty @xmath46 . following the standard argument[28 ]",
    ", one takes this @xmath47 relation and converts it into the relation @xmath48 using the special relativistic dispersion relation .",
    "finally @xmath49 is converted into the relation @xmath50 because the measurement procedure requires @xmath51 , in order to ensure that the relevant energy uncertainties are not large enough to allow the production of additional copies of the particle whose position is being measured . if indeed our quantum - gravity scenario hosts a planck - scale modification of the dispersion relation of the form ( 9 ) then clearly the relation between @xmath52 and @xmath53 should be re - written as follows @xmath54\\delta e_\\gamma.\\ ] ] this relation will modify density of states for statistical systems . note that one can use gup to find such relation between @xmath55 and @xmath53[15 ] .",
    "now we are going to calculate thermodynamical properties of ultra - relativistic particles in early universe , using the generalized uncertainty principle .",
    "we consider the following gup as our primary input , @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a dimensionless constant .",
    "consider the early stages of the universe evolution .",
    "analogue to a particle inside a box , in the case of the early universe one can consider a causal box ( i.e. particle horizon ) which any observer in the universe has to do measurements within this scale[29 ] . in the language of wave mechanics ,",
    "if @xmath58 denotes the wave function of a given particle , the probability of finding this particle by an observer outside its horizon is zero , i. e. @xmath59 . from the theory of relativity , measurement of a stick length",
    "can be done by sending simultaneous signals to the observer from the two endpoints , where for the scales larger than the causal size , those signals need more than the age of the universe to be received . looking back to the history of the universe , the particle horizon after the planck era grows as @xmath60 , but inflates to a huge size by the beginning of inflationary epoch . here",
    "@xmath61 is hubble parameter . in the pre - inflationary epoch ,",
    "the maximum uncertainty in the location of a particle , @xmath62 results in an uncertainty in the momentum of the particle which is given by @xmath63 this leads to a minimum uncertainty in momentum as @xmath64 therefore , we can conclude that(assuming that @xmath65 ) @xmath66 which leads to @xmath67 for ultra - relativistic particles in three space dimensions . now , suppose that @xmath68 where @xmath69 is given by @xmath70 to obtain complete thermodynamics of the system , we calculate partition function of the system and then we use standard thermodynamical relations . in classical statistical mechanics , partition function for a system composed of ultra - relativistic noninteracting monatomic particles ( fermions or bosons )",
    "is given by @xmath71 in our case , due to limitation imposed by gup and particle horizon , we should consider the following generalization @xmath72 where we have used relations ( 7 ) , ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) respectively . by definition , the entropy of the system is given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the free energy of the system defined as @xmath75 so the entropy of the system can be written as @xmath76.\\ ] ] for ultra - relativistic fermions this relation leads to the following expression @xmath77 @xmath78,\\ ] ] where for simplicity we have defined @xmath79 while for bosons we find @xmath80 @xmath81,\\ ] ] where @xmath82 in these equations @xmath83 is defined as @xmath84 with @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "note that both of the equations ( 23 ) and ( 24 ) are well behavior in high and low temperature limits . in the standard situation , we have @xmath87 , @xmath30 and @xmath88 .",
    "so we find the well - known and standard results for entropy of the corresponding ultra - relativistic fermionic or bosonic systems . from ( 22 )",

    ", the entropy of the system tends to zero in @xmath109 .",
    "this situation is shown in figure 1 , ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "within gup framework , entropy tends to zero in a nonzero temperature , that is , for @xmath110 .",

    "note that these figures are plotted in arbitrary units and they show only general behaviors of the functions .",
    "figure 3 shows the behavior of specific heat of the system in various conditions .",
    "in gup framework , the general behavior of @xmath111 has considerable departure from its standard counterpart in high temperature regime .",
    "now we are going to formulate early universe thermodynamics within mdr framework .",

    "+ as has been indicated , there are severe constraints on the functional form of mdr which these constraint are motivated when one compares black hole entropy - area relation in different points of view[15,21 ] . in this case",

    "+ the possible relation between gup and mdrs itself is under investigation[14,15 ] .",
    "generally these two features of quantum gravity scenarios are not equivalent , but as hossenfelder has shown , they can be related to each other[14](see also [ 15 ] ) . as a result",
    ", it is natural to expect that under special circumstances , our results for early universe thermodynamics within gup and mdrs should transform to each other .",
    "this is a transformation between coefficients of our equations and overall behaviors of thermodynamical quantities , specially their temperature dependence are similar .",

    "we have studied thermodynamics of early universe within both gup and mdrs .",
    "we have considered early universe as a statistical system composed of ultra - relativistic particles .",
    "since both particle horizon distance and gup impose severe constraint on measurement processes , the statistical mechanics of the system should be modified to contain these constraint .",
    "since gup and mdrs are quantum gravitation effects , the modified thermodynamics within gup and mdrs tends to standard thermodynamics in classical limits .",
    "there are severe constraints on the functional form of mdrs from string theory considerations .",
    "when we consider these constraints , the results of mdrs and gup for thermodynamics of early universe tends to each other in their general temperature dependence and they differs only in their numerical factors .",
    "this fact may be interpreted so that gup and mdrs essentially are not different concepts of quantum gravity proposal . although the exact relation between gup and mdrs is not known yet",
    ", our formalism of early universe shows the very close relation between these two aspects of quantum gravity .",
    "+ in standard statistical mechanics of bosonic and fermionic gases , the entropy of the system tends to zero in @xmath109 . as our equations and corresponding numerical result show , within gup framework entropy of the system tends to zero in a temperature larger than zero ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "this is a consequence of the relation ( 5 ) .",
    "the volume of the fundamental cell of phase space increases due to gup .",
    "note that mdrs give entropy - temperature relation which has no difference with gup result in its general behavior .",
    "figure 2 shows the pressure of the system versus temperature .",
    "pressure tends to zero in a temperature larger than @xmath109 .",
    "the same behavior is repeated by specific heat of the system .",
    "so , our analysis shows an unusual thermodynamics for statistical systems in quantum gravity eras .",
