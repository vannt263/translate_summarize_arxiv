    "we are concerned with the following :    * vector chromatic number @xmath0 * strict vector chromatic number @xmath2 * quantum chromatic number @xmath3    as the notation suggests , the strict vector chromatic number is equal to the lovsz @xmath1-function of the complement , i.e.  @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the complement of graph @xmath5 .",
    "we , however , do not define it in this way , rather we approach both @xmath4 and @xmath16 in terms of homomorphisms . from this viewpoint",
    "they can both be seen as relaxations of chromatic number defined in terms of assigning unit vectors to vertices such that vectors assigned to adjacent vertices have some specified inner product .",
    "quantum chromatic number can also be viewed in terms of homomorphisms , however for this parameter we assign to vertices tuples of orthogonal projectors which must satisfy certain constraints .    in this paper",
    "we are concerned with how these parameters behave on certain graph products .",
    "we are in particular focused on the cartesian and categorical products , denoted by @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively . a well known theorem of sabidussi  @xcite states that the chromatic number of the cartesian product of two graphs is equal to the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its factors .",
    "an equally , if not more , well known conjecture of hedetniemi proposes that the chromatic number of the categorical product of two graphs is equal to the minimum of the chromatic numbers of the factors .",
    "our aim is to prove or make steps towards proving analogs of these two statements for the three parameters above .",
    "the rest of the paper is outlined as follows .    in section  [ sec : basics ]",
    "we define the basic concepts and notation used throughout the paper .",
    "we give the background needed for our results on vector and strict vector colorings in section  [ subsec : vectcolor ] .",
    "this is followed by section  [ sec : bartheta ] , in which we show that analogs of sabidussi s theorem hold for @xmath4 and @xmath16 , and that the @xmath4 version of hedetniemi s conjecture is true . in section  [ sec:1homogeneous ] , we investigate a class of graphs called 1-homogeneous graphs , which include edge transitive graphs .",
    "we give an explicit formula for @xmath4 and @xmath16 for these graphs in terms of their largest and smallest eigenvalues . as a consequence",

    "then in section  [ sec : quantum ] , we prove the quantum analog of sabidussi s theorem , and show that quantum hedetniemi s conjecture holds for a family of graphs which initiated the study of quantum chromatic number .",
    "here we give the background on the basic tools such as homomorphisms and graph products that we use throughout the paper . for a more detailed introduction",

    "let @xmath5 and @xmath6 be graphs ( by which we mean undirected simple finite graphs ) .",

    "it is easy to see that homomorphisms compose , so @xmath20 implies @xmath21 .",
    "in fact , graphs with homomorphisms form a category . more relevant for graph theory",
    "is that many graph theoretic notions can be simply expressed in terms of homomorphisms .",
    "in particular , a graph @xmath5 is @xmath12-colorable if and only if @xmath22 .",
    "a graph parameter @xmath23 is called _ homomorphism - monotone _ if we have @xmath24 whenever @xmath19 .",
    "examples of homomorphism - monotone parameters include @xmath25 , etc .",
    "we will see that the three parameters , @xmath16 , @xmath4 , and @xmath26 are homomorphism - monotone as well , and they are even _ quantum homomorphism - monotone_. ( quantum homomorphisms will be defined in section  [ subsec : quantum ] ) .",
    "given graphs @xmath5 and @xmath6 , we define four graphs with vertex set @xmath27 . in the _ categorical product _",
    "@xmath18 ( also called direct , or tensor product ) , tuples @xmath28 and @xmath29 are adjacent if and only if @xmath30 in the _ cartesian product _ @xmath17 , tuples @xmath28 and @xmath29 are adjacent if and only if @xmath31    the _ strong product _",
    "@xmath32 is defined as the edge union of @xmath18 and @xmath17 . in the _ disjunctive product _",
    "@xmath33 ( also referred to as the conormal product ) the tuples @xmath28 and @xmath29 are adjacent if @xmath34 or @xmath35 .",
    "it is trivial to see that @xmath32 is a subgraph of @xmath33 , and a little thought reveals that @xmath36 , where @xmath15 denotes the complement of @xmath5 .",

    ", we see that @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "( this is indeed true in any category and @xmath18 is called the categorical product because it is , in fact , a product in the sense of category theory . )",
    "consequently , we have the following lemma :    [ lem : homomono ] if @xmath23 is a homomorphism - monotone graph parameter and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are graphs , then @xmath41    _ proof . _ this follows immediately from the fact that @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "this lemma allows us to easily establish that @xmath16 , @xmath4 , and @xmath26 must all satisfy the above inequalities .",

    "much attention has specifically been given to the value of the chromatic number on the cartesian and categorical products , and this is of course part of the motivation for our work . applying the above lemma to the chromatic number , which is homomorphism - monotone , we obtain the following : @xmath44 and @xmath45 as mentioned above , a well known theorem of sabidussi  @xcite states that  ( [ cartprod ] ) holds with equality , and we provide a proof here for the reader s convenience and comparison with theorems  [ thm : sabibartheta ] and  [ thm : qsabi ] .

    "determining whether ( [ catprod ] ) holds with equality turns out to be much more difficult , and the following conjecture remains open to this day :    [ hedconj ] for all graphs @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath53    it is worth noting that many different versions of this statement have been either conjectured or proven since its inception .",
    "perhaps most significantly , zhu has recently proved in  @xcite that @xmath54 where @xmath55 denotes fractional chromatic number .",
    "zhu s proof makes use of the fact that fractional chromatic number can be written as a linear program and thus suffers from strong duality . as we will see below , the strong duality property of the semidefinite programs for @xmath4 and @xmath16 are crucial for our proofs as well",
    "this suggests that the lack of strong duality for chromatic number is one reason for the difficulty in attempting to prove hedetniemi s conjecture .",
    "vector and strict vector colorings were first introduced in  @xcite , in which karger , motwani , and sudan also defined the vector chromatic number . however , a parameter equal to @xmath16 of the complement was actually introduced a few decades earlier in  @xcite and  @xcite , but this seems to have gone unnoticed by many .",
    "we will first define strict vector colorings :    [ def : strictvectcolor ] let @xmath56 denote the unit sphere in @xmath57 . for a graph @xmath5 , a map @xmath58",

    "we refer the reader to  @xcite and  @xcite .    if we relax the definition above to only require that adjacent vertices are assigned unit vectors which have inner product _ at most _",

    "the basic motivation behind these definitions is that mapping the vertices of the complete graph @xmath13 to the vertices of the @xmath68-dimensional simplex gives a ( strict ) vector @xmath12-coloring , and therefore any @xmath12-colorable graph is also ( strict ) vector @xmath12-colorable .",
    "this of course implies that @xmath69 for all graphs @xmath5 .",
    "though we will not , it can be proved ( for instance by using the dual sdps given below ) that the above ( strict ) vector coloring of @xmath13 is optimal , and thus @xmath70 .",
    "since any strict vector @xmath59-coloring is clearly a vector @xmath59-coloring as well , we have that @xmath71 for any graph @xmath5 .",

    "furthermore , note that condition  ( [ eq : meas ] ) implies that for distinct vertices @xmath189 , we have that @xmath190 .",
    "the reasoning behind the name of the measurement graph is that its vertices are what are known as  projective quantum measurements \" . in general ,",
    "a quantum measurement can consist of any positive semidefinite operators which sum to identity , but if each of the operators is a projection , then it is referred to as a projective measurement .",
    "we say that @xmath5 has a quantum homomorphism to @xmath6 , and write @xmath191 , if @xmath192 for some @xmath193 .",
    "we will also refer to a homomorphism from @xmath5 to @xmath194 as a quantum homomorphism from @xmath5 to @xmath6 .",

    ". therefore @xmath197 .",
    "now that we have defined quantum homomorphisms , we can define quantum colorings and quantum chromatic number in the obvious way : a _",
    "quantum @xmath12-coloring _ of a graph @xmath5 is simply a quantum homomorphism from @xmath5 to @xmath13 , and the _ quantum chromatic number _ of @xmath5 , denoted @xmath198 , is the minimum @xmath12 such that @xmath199 .",
    "note that since @xmath197 , for all @xmath5 and @xmath6 , we have that @xmath200 for all graphs @xmath5 .",
    "the definition of quantum homomorphism may seem a bit arbitrary , but it arises from the following physical considerations .    for graphs @xmath5 and @xmath6 , the @xmath201-homomorphism game consists of two players , alice and bob , trying to convince a referee that they have a homomorphism from @xmath5 to @xmath6 .",

    "it is not too difficult to see that classical players ( who can use probabilistic strategies and have access to shared randomness ) can win the @xmath201-homomorphism game with certainty if and only if there exists a homomorphism from @xmath5 to  @xmath6 .",

    "@xcite it was proven that for @xmath206 , the @xmath201-homomorphism game can be won by quantum players if and only if @xmath192 for some @xmath193 ( though it was not phrased in this way ) . in",
    "@xcite they note that the same proof works for any graph @xmath6 and they introduce the measurement graph .",
    "the general idea behind the correspondence between winning quantum strategies for the @xmath201-homomorphism game and homomorphisms from @xmath5 to @xmath194 is as follows : let @xmath195 be a homomorphism from @xmath5 to @xmath194 .",
    "if alice and bob receive @xmath202 respectively , then alice and bob can perform measurements @xmath207 and @xmath208 on what is known as a  maximally entangled state \" to win the game . here , @xmath208 corresponds to taking the transpose of each coordinate of @xmath209 .",

    "it is not surprising that we were more succesful with the analogs of sabidussi s theorem , as this seems to be the easier of the two problems in general .",
    "however , we conjecture that the @xmath16 and @xmath26 versions of hedetniemi s conjecture hold in general .    with the similarity between @xmath16 and @xmath4 , it is worthwhile considering why the proof of theorem  [ thm : hedbartheta ] can not be used to prove a version of hedetniemi s conjecture for @xmath16 .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thm : hedbartheta ] relies on the following three properties of @xmath4 :      combining the last two gives that @xmath288 which along with the first proves the theorem .",

    "of course this does not mean that a version of hedetniemi s conjecture for @xmath16 can not be proved , but a different approach is needed .",
    "we can consider the same analysis for @xmath26 .",
    "theorem  [ thm : qsabi ] shows that ( 1 ) holds for @xmath26 .",
    "item ( 4 ) of lemma  [ lem : qhomocart ] concerning the disjunctive product shows that @xmath290 , and then the same trick used to prove corollary  [ cor : barthetaunion ] shows that ( 3 ) holds for @xmath26 .",

    "this is because one can use strong duality when working with @xmath16 , whereas @xmath26 is not known to have this property . on the other hand ,",
    "finding a counterexample to the conjecture ( if one exists ) is also likely easier for @xmath16 since it can be computed efficiently , and @xmath26 is not even known to be computable ."
