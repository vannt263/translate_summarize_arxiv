    "<S> we measure the optical conductivity @xmath0 of ( srmno@xmath1)@xmath2/(lamno@xmath1)@xmath3 superlattices ( sl ) for @xmath4 , and 8 and @xmath5 k. data show a @xmath6-dependent insulator to metal transition ( imt ) for @xmath7 , driven by the softening of a polaronic mid - infrared band . at @xmath8 </S>",
    "<S> = 5 that softening is incomplete , while at the largest - period @xmath9 compound the mir band is independent of @xmath6 and the sl remains insulating . </S>",
    "<S> one can thus first observe the imt in a manganite system in the absence of the disorder due to chemical doping . </S>",
    "<S> unsuccessful reconstruction of the sl optical properties from those of the original bulk materials suggests that ( srmno@xmath1)@xmath2/(lamno@xmath1)@xmath3 heterostructures give rise to a novel electronic state .    </S>",
    "<S> since decades , manganites attract the greatest attention of the condensed matter community @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is due either to the colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) which makes them appealing for the applications , and to the rich doping - temperature phase diagram which is of great interest for basic research . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> several studies have been devoted to the insulator - to - metal transition ( imt ) coupled to ferromagnetic ordering at hole - doping levels @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the imt is understood through the double - exchange ( de ) mechanism @xcite , once the localization tendency due to polaron formation has been taken into account @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> today it is widely recognized that quenched disorder weakens long range order and causes ferromagnetism to break up into clusters , whose sudden alignment in the presence of a magnetic field is an essential ingredient of cmr @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> recent progress in the growth of atomic - scale multilayers opens exciting opportunities in the design of materials with novel properties . </S>",
    "<S> the so - called `` electronic reconstruction '' effect produces a new 2-d metallic state at the interface between a band insulator as srtio@xmath1 and a mott insulator like latio@xmath1 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> manganite superlattices with alternating layers of insulating anti - ferromagnets srmno@xmath1 ( smo ) and lamno@xmath1 ( lmo ) have been recently studied as well @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thanks to electronic reconstruction , both metallicity and ferromagnetism can be induced in these nano - structured superlattices ( sls ) @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the ( srmno@xmath1)@xmath2/(lamno@xmath1)@xmath3 sl system corresponds to an effective hole doping 1/3 . when @xmath11 , the spacing between interfaces is so small , that the 3-d charge distribution throughout the film is believed to be uniform @xcite . for @xmath12 an imt below a temperature @xmath13 comparable to that of the corresponding la@xmath14sr@xmath15mno@xmath1 takes place in the absence of random disorder @xcite . for sufficiently low temperatures , dc measurements show that the film made up of two insulators becomes metallic for small @xmath8 @xcite . nevertheless , the way the imt is approached for decreasing @xmath8 , the excitations involved , and the sl low - energy electrodynamics are still to be investigated . </S>",
    "<S> one may also ask whether the dc resistivity reflects the carrier dynamics at the interfaces or that in between , and whether the optical properties resemble or not those of the bulk materials . </S>",
    "<S> we address these problems by means of infrared spectroscopy , a tool which has been successfully used to probe the low - energy electrodynamics @xcite and the mechanism of the imt @xcite in a number of oxides . </S>",
    "<S> the results on ( srmno@xmath1)@xmath2/(lamno@xmath1)@xmath3 superlattices with @xmath16 are presented here , in a wide range of frequency and temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> the four films of ( srmno@xmath1)@xmath2/(lamno@xmath1)@xmath3 , all 20 nm thick , have been grown by molecular - beam epitaxy on srtio@xmath1 ( sto ) substrates , following a procedure described elsewhere @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have measured their reflectivity ( @xmath17 ) from 50 to 45000 @xmath18 at nearly normal incidence , between 10 and 400 k , employing either au or al reference mirrors . </S>",
    "<S> the results at 10 k are reported and compared with each other in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ reflectivity]-a , together with the @xmath17 of a bare sto substrate , etched and annealed under the same conditions used for the preparation of the sls . </S>",
    "<S> its contribution obviously dominates the shape of @xmath17 in all films , and particularly for a large - period superlattice such as @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> however , with decreasing @xmath8 the reflectivity decreases appreciably below 800 @xmath18 and , at @xmath12 , the shape of @xmath17 has substantially changed indicating that such sl does effectively screen the substrate . indeed , a similar @xmath17 is reported in ref . for a la@xmath14sr@xmath15mno@xmath1 film grown on sto , at low temperature . </S>",
    "<S> panels from b ) to e ) in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ reflectivity ] show the @xmath6-dependence of @xmath17 in the individual sls . </S>",
    "<S> the effect observed below 150 @xmath18 in all samples is not related to the sl physics , being due to the sto substrate approaching the ferroelectric phase @xcite . at higher energies , for large @xmath8 ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ reflectivity]-b and -c ) the @xmath6-dependence is poor , and similar to that of the sto substrate . </S>",
    "<S> a more pronounced evolution is observed for @xmath8 = 3 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ reflectivity]-d and especially for @xmath12 , for which @xmath17 drastically changes over the whole range ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ reflectivity]-e ) . finally , all curves converge at about 8000 @xmath18 as shown in the inset .    to extract the optical conductivity from our data we have performed drude - lorentz ( dl ) fits to @xmath17 , by taking into account the contributions from both the film and the substrate , as well as the ( incoherent ) internal reflections between them , by using standard formulae for thin films @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the model treats the film as an effective medium , neglecting the internal reflections from the lmo / smo interfaces , whose depths and spacings are much smaller than any wavelength here employed . </S>",
    "<S> best dl fits need just four components : one drude term , one mid - infrared ( mir ) band , and two higher energy oscillators ( the lowest being centered at 2 ev ) which model the electronic interband transitions . </S>",
    "<S> this choice yields the same results as a kramers - kronig constrained analysis @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting real part of the optical conductivity @xmath19 is displayed in fig . </S>",

    "<S> [ sigma ] displays @xmath19 at 10 k , for all the sls under consideration . </S>",

    "<S> i.e. _ , decreasing sl period ) , a sizable drude term appears , while the absorption edge softens appreciably . at @xmath12 </S>",
    "<S> we are left with a sharp drude peak superimposed to a low - frequency harmonic oscillator centered below 1000 @xmath18 , thus highlighting that a simple drude term does not properly describe the charge dynamics in the metallic state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of a broad mir band is frequently observed in manganites and other oxides , and is a signature for charge - carriers mass renormalization . in manganites , </S>",
    "<S> the source of mass enhancement is usually identified with polaron formation @xcite . for @xmath12 , the shape of the optical conductivity is strikingly similar to that measured on la@xmath20sr@xmath21mno@xmath1 cleaved single crystals @xcite and la@xmath14sr@xmath15mno@xmath1 films @xcite , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ sigma]-e . </S>",
    "<S> therein , as @xmath6 increases , the drude term weakens , while the mid - infrared band starts to harden above @xmath22 k ( see fig . [ parameters ] ) , until a minimum in @xmath19 forms at about 1500 @xmath18 between the two terms . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath8 the optical values are systematically lower than the dc measurements </S>",
    "<S> . this discrepancy may be due to disorder - induced localization effects at sub - thz frequencies , which can not be probed by the optical measurement @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however one should also take into account that while optics probes in - plane excitations only , the dc measurement may include paths perpendicular to the layers with higher resistivity , in series to those parallel to them @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , at @xmath33 the charge distribution is not believed to be uniform , since the thomas - fermi length - scale for charge leakage is estimated to fall between 1 and 3 unit cells @xcite . for long sl periods , as @xmath6 lowers , @xmath34 first displays a de - driven imt at the @xmath13 indicated by the arrows , and then an insulating - like variable - range - hopping @xcite ( panels d , e , f ) . </S>",
    "<S> this low-@xmath6 upturn is not observed in the @xmath35 extracted from the reflectivity at normal incidence , which probes the in - plane conductivity only , averaged between the various ( @xmath36 ) layers ( @xmath37 ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , optical measurements are less affected by the more insulating out - of - plane behavior . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , both for @xmath38 and 5 , the @xmath13 values obtained by the two techniques in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ parameters ] are consistent . </S>",

    "<S> one may notice that neither lmo @xcite nor smo @xcite alone ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ sigma]-a ) display electronic bands below 2 ev ( 16.000 @xmath18 ) . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , manganites at low - doping levels as la@xmath40sr@xmath41mno@xmath1 exhibit a substantial absorption below 2 ev , while remaining insulating @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the mir band in the @xmath9 superlattice should result from an effective charge doping introduced by the interface , and leaked throughout the overall system , as suggested in fig . </S>",

    "<S> a similar behavior has also been observed in the @xmath8 = 16 sl , reported in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ sigma]-a at 300 k only . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ sigma]-b , for @xmath8 = 8 a tiny drude term is observed above 200 k only , accounting for a carrier density on the order of 10@xmath42 @xmath43 . for decreasing @xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> the material becomes more insulating , in agreement with the semiconducting - like behavior of the resistivity in panel d ) . as for large @xmath8 </S>",
    "<S> the number of interfaces is rather diluted within the sample thickness , one can not exclude the presence of a low-@xmath6 metallic state in the @xmath9 sl . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , we can safely set an upper bound to the sheet carrier density @xmath44 of this thin layer at 5x10@xmath45 @xmath46 .    in the opposite limit of short period ( @xmath12 ) , </S>",

    "<S> [ parameters ] clearly shows the mechanism of its transition to the metallic state . in panel </S>",
    "<S> a ) , around room temperature @xmath24 starts a spectacular decrease from 5000 to about 1000 @xmath18 ( at 100 k ) . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile its intensity increases ( panel c ) , a strong drude term is built up ( b ) and the resistivity exhibits a metallic behavior ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ parameters]-g ) . </S>",
    "<S> the increase of drude and mir spectral weight must be at the expenses of higher energy bands , but we can not verify this assumption for the difficulty in taking reliable data vs. temperature at high energy on such thin films . </S>",
    "<S> one can just say that the sum rule on the optical conductivity may not be fulfilled in these sls unless the cutoff frequency is much larger than 10000 @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> basing on the above considerations and on the close resemblance between the @xmath19 of the sl and of the corresponding alloy in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ sigma]-b , one can assume a uniform charge density distribution perpendicularly to the layers . </S>",
    "<S> this carrier density can be calculated by adding to the drude spectral weight that of the polaronic charges in the mir band . at @xmath8 = 1 and low @xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> one obtains @xmath47x@xmath48 @xmath43 , which roughly corresponds to 1/3 of the mn ion density of the film , after using the proper band - mass values @xmath49 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we can also estimate the mass renormalization factor as @xmath50 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this yields @xmath51 , in fair agreement with previous reports @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if instead of a drude+mir model one assumes an extended drude framework , one finds @xmath52 , thus demonstrating the generality of the present results .    for intermediate @xmath8 ( @xmath38 , 5 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ parameters ] ) , a weak drude term comes out at low @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this is likely due to the presence of metallic - like layers ( of mixed valence ) close to the interfaces , sandwiched between the insulators ( layers made up of integer or almost integer mn@xmath53 and mn@xmath54 ions ) . </S>",
    "<S> a proper decomposition of the optical conductivity implies a detailed knowledge of the layer - dependent charge density distribution . </S>",
    "<S> since this quantity is not available we can make the simplifying assumption that the metallic layers behave as those of the @xmath12 compound . under this hypothesis </S>",
    "<S> we can provide a rough estimate of the metallic fraction , as the ratio of the drude carrier density over that of the homogeneous @xmath12 compound , thus yielding 40% and 10% for @xmath38 and 5 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> note however , that a crude reconstruction of the optical spectra of @xmath38 and 5 , as linear combinations of the optical conductivities of @xmath12 , bulk lmo , and bulk smo does not fit the data of fig [ sigma ] . </S>",
    "<S> this makes the ( smo)n/(lmo)2n superlattice to appear as a novel member , with its own properties , of the manganite family .    </S>",
    "<S> in conclusion , we have presented here the first optical measurements on ( smo)n/(lmo)2n superlattices , aimed at observing the mechanism of an imt driven by carrier density modulation and temperature in the absence of disorder . at the largest lattice period ( @xmath9 ) </S>",
    "<S> the spectra indicate an insulating or poorly metallic behavior at low temperatures , with the presence of a mir band around 10000 @xmath18 , which is not observed in bulk smo or lmo and may be attributed to strongly localized charges ( small polarons ) . the same band is found at lower energies both at @xmath8 = 5 and @xmath8 = 3 , where its slight softening at low @xmath6 is accompanied by the building of a small drude term . at @xmath8 = 1 , where eventually the charge reaches a uniform distribution throughout the film , a dramatic softening of the mir band triggers a de - driven imt around room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath6 lowers , the mir band continues to increase in intensity and to displace toward zero frequency , assuming a large polaron character , thus providing low - energy states to the drude term . </S>",
    "<S> the polaronic character of the charges is confirmed by an effective mass , which at @xmath8=1 is @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> the optical data , once extrapolated to @xmath56 , provide an alternative determination of the superlattice resistivity , which is not affected by paths perpendicular to the interfaces . probably for this reason , they do not show the low-@xmath6 upturn exhibited by dc measurements . as a whole , this optical study of the ( smo)n/(lmo)2n system shows that such heterostructure has its own properties , characterizing a novel electronic state which is profoundly different from those of doped bulk manganites except for the smallest interlayer spacing at @xmath12 , where however the metallization at @xmath13 takes place in the unusual absence of disorder . </S>"
