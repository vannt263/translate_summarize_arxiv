    "the evolution of the universe in the standard cold dark matter model is characterized by hierarchical structure formation where small haloes form first , and subsequently merge to form larger haloes .",
    "high resolution n - body simulations have indicated that massive haloes retain a substantial amount of substructure @xcite , consisting of bound dark matter clumps orbiting within the potential of their host halo . evidently , such subhaloes were themselves independent , self - contained haloes in the past , before merging with a more massive halo . if sufficiently massive , these subhaloes were sites of baryon dissipation and star formation in the past .",
    "there are many indications , from studies of the statistical properties of how galaxies and sub - structures populate haloes , that galaxies in groups and clusters are in fact the observational counterparts of subhaloes .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite show that the auto correlation functions of substructures in high resoution n - body simulations are in good agreement with the observed auto correlation functions of galaxies . on the theory side ,",
    "@xcite find that the distribution of subhaloes in high resolution n - body simulations is similar to that of smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) galaxies in @xcite and @xcite , and @xcite find good agreement between the properties of galaxies in their sph simulation , and the properties of halos in their matched n - body simulation .",
    "using n - body simulations to study galaxy formation requires a framework for populating dark matter halos with galaxies .",
    "one approach is to employ semi - analytic models which use analytic techniques and phenomenological recipes to follow the evolution of baryons within dark matter halos .",
    "an alternative is to eschew assumptions about baryonic physics and use an empirical approach to relate observed galaxy properties to dark matter halo properties .",
    "one popular approach in this class of models is abundance matching which assumes a monotonic relationship between galaxy luminosity and halo mass .",
    "a key aspect of studying galaxy formation within the cold dark matter paradigm is to understand the fate of galaxies following halo mergers - how and when galaxy mergers happen , how and when galaxies are tidally disrupted and what ultimately happens to galaxies that fall in to more massive haloes . in this paper , we model the dynamical evolution of subhaloes and their galaxies using a combination of numerical and analytical methods .",
    "the formation of dark matter haloes through the growth of dark matter perturbations can be studied numerically using dissipationless cosmological simulations . but haloes do not evolve in isolation from each other . when a halo enters the virial radius of a more massive halo , its evolution becomes more complex than that of independent haloes .",
    "after falling in to a more massive halo , ( sub)haloes experience tidal forces which cause mass loss , and even complete disruption under extreme circumstances . furthermore , satellite subhaloes orbiting within a host halo lose energy and angular momentum through dynamical friction which causes their orbits to sink towards the halo centre .",
    "galaxy formation models use two principal approaches to model the dynamical evolution of subhaloes and satellite galaxies .",
    "the first is to use analytically calculated or physically motivated empirical formulae for various aspects of the dynamical evolution of subhaloes such as the timescale for merging through dynamical friction , tidal stripping , tidal destruction , etc .",

    "an alternative approach , that avoids simplifying assumptions , is to use an n - body simulation to follow the dynamic evolution of subhaloes .",
    "n - body simulations capture the complexity of the physics of tidal disruption and dynamical friction , and do not require simplifying assumptions , either about the physical processes or the distribution of orbital parameters . however , subhalo merging and disruption are affected by finite force and mass resolution .",
    "insufficiently resolved subhaloes disrupt artificially and on shorter timescales than well resolved haloes @xcite . using a fixed subhalo mass resolution limit ,",
    "regardless of infall mass , leads to lower mass subhaloes being artificially disrupted more quickly .    in subhalo abundance",
    "matching ( sham ) models , which assume a monotonic relationship between subhalo mass at infall and galaxy luminosity , it is assumed that each galaxy survives as long as its subhalo can be identified in an n - body simulation above a fixed resolution threshold .",
    "some models allow galaxies to survive for a period of time after the disruption of their host subhaloes @xcite , while in contrast , @xcite allows satellite galaxies to be disrupted even while their subhaloes still exist .",
    "in contrast , the galform semi - analytic model uses an analytical formula to calculate the merger timescale for a satellite galaxy @xcite .",
    "following a halo merger , it is assumed that the galaxy hosted by the less massive halo enters the host halo on an orbit with orbital parameters randomly drawn from a distribution .",
    "the merger timescale is then computed using the analytical formulae of @xcite in the galform model of @xcite and the analytical formulae of @xcite in the galform model of @xcite .",
    "once this time has elapsed , the galaxy hosted by this subhalo is considered to have merged with the central galaxy of the more massive host halo .    in this paper",
    ", we employ a hybrid approach to follow the dynamical evolution of subhaloes .",
    "we follow subhaloes in an n - body simulation until the point when they can no longer be resolved .",
    "we then calculate a merger timescale using its orbital parameters and mass at the epoch that it was last resolved in the n - body simulation . our formula to calculate the merger timescale",
    "is based on @xcite , with parameters suitably modified to match our n - body simulation results .",
    "our scheme is faithful to the underlying n - body simulation , minimising the reliance on analytically determined orbits . instead of making assumptions about the orbital parameters of satellites",
    ", we track the positions of their associated subhaloes .",
    "our goal is to provide a simple model for the dynamical evolution of subhaloes that uses the information in an n - body simulation , but can produce results that are not affected by artificial disruption of subhaloes due to limited resolution . while our model is primarily intended for application in semi - analytic models , it can also be used in other models of galaxy formation that use n - body simulations like sham models .",
    "we assume that once a subhalo reaches the centre of its host halo , the galaxy associated with the subhalo merges with the central galaxy of the host halo .",
    "we also assume that once a subhalo is tidally disrupted , the galaxy it hosts is also tidally disrupted .",

    "the subfind algorithm @xcite is then applied to each fof group to split it into a set of self - bound subhaloes .",
    "the central subhalo is defined as the most massive subunit of a fof group .",
    "we construct subhalo merger trees which link each subhalo at each epoch to a unique descendent in the following epoch .",

    "subhalo abundance matching ( sham ) is a technique for assigning galaxies to simulated dark matter haloes and subhaloes .",
    "the essential assumptions are that all galaxies reside in identifiable dark matter substructures and that luminosity or stellar mass of a galaxy is monotonically related to the potential well depth of its host halo or subhalo .",
    "some implementations use the maximum of the circular velocity profile as the indicator of potential well depth , while others use halo or subhalo mass .",
    "the first clear formulations of sham as a systematic method appear in @xcite and @xcite , but these build on a number of previous studies that either test the underpinnings of sham or implicitly assume sham - like galaxy assignment ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "n - body simulations produce subhaloes that are located within the virial radius of haloes .",
    "the present mass of subhaloes is a product of mass build up during the period when the halo evolves in isolation and tidal mass loss after it enters the virial radius of a more massive halo ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the stellar component , however , is at the bottom of the potential well and more tightly bound making it less likely to be affected by tidal forces .",

    "@xcite apply a global statistical correction to subhalo masses relative to halo masses ( as do @xcite ) , while @xcite explicitly identify subhaloes at the epoch of accretion and use the maximum circular velocity at that epoch .",
    "our formulation here is similar to that of @xcite , though we use mass rather than circular velocity .",
    "specifically , we assume a monotonic relationship between galaxy luminosity and halo mass ( at infall ) and determine the form of this relation by solving the implicit equation @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the number densities of galaxies and haloes , respectively , @xmath19 is the galaxy @xmath20-band magnitude threshold , and @xmath21 is the halo mass threshold chosen so that the number density of haloes above it is equal to the number density of galaxies in the sample . the quantity @xmath22 is defined as follows : @xmath23 where z@xmath24 is the epoch when a halo first enters the virial radius of a more massive halo .",
