    "[ introduction ]    _ combinatorial physics _ is a growing field , defining itself as the interdisciplinary domain overlapping between combinatorics and physics .",
    "one can clearly identify nowadays several aspects of this larger and larger overlapping .",
    "thus , the interference between combinatorics and quantum mechanics has been investigated in @xcite , @xcite ( and references within ) .",
    "an important interplay area can be noticed between combinatorics ( bijective , enumerative and so on ) on one hand and statistical physics and integrable combinatorics on another hand ( see , for example , @xcite for a recent review on this topic ) .",
    "our paper deals with yet another aspect of this interdisciplinary field of research , namely the interference between combinatorics and quantum field theory ( commutative or non - commutative ) .",
    "this type of interference has already appeared in the pioneering work of alain connes and dirk kreimer , who have defined a hopf algebra encoding in an elegant way the combinatorics of the process of perturbative renormalization in commutative quantum field theory .",
    "this structure has then been generalized for noncommutative quantum field theory @xcite , @xcite and for spin - foam quantum gravity models @xcite , @xcite . for general reviews of various interferences between algebraic and analytic ( and not only ) combinatorics and quantum field theory in general",
    ", we invite the interested reader to consult @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider appropriate characters of the the hopf algebra of isomorphic classes of matroids , algebra defined ( as a particularization of a more general construction of incidence hopf algebra ) in @xcite ( and then extensively studied in @xcite ) .",
    "we also show that these characters are related to the tutte polynomial for matroids and we then use a quantum field theory renormalization group - like differential equation to prove the universality of the tutte polynomial for matroids .",
    "more precisely , we show that a solution of such an equation is given by the characters that we have defined . as a by - product of our hopf algebraic approach , we give a new proof of a convolution formula for the tutte polynomial for matroids , formula exhibited in @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in the following section we introduce the renormalization group equation in quantum field theory and we then recall some useful notions related to matroids and to the tutte polynomial for matroids .",
    "finally , we give the definition of the hopf algebra of isomorphic classes of matroids . in the third section",
    "we define the hopf algebra characters that will be used in the sequel . in the following section",
    ", we use this construction to give our new proof of the convolution formula for the tutte polynomial for matroids mentioned above .",
    "the fifth section is dedicated to our main result , the proof of the universality of the tutte polynomial for matroids .",
    "the last section presents some concluding remarks and perspectives for future work .",
    "in this section we first briefly recall some quantum field theory notions , namely the renormalization group differential equation .",
    "we then give the definition of matroids , of the associated tutte polynomial as well as some further properties which will be useful to prove the results of this paper .",
    "finally , the hopf algebra of isomorphic classes of matroids is given .      a qft model ( for a general introduction to qft see for example the books @xcite or @xcite ) is defined by means of a functional integral of the exponential of an _ action _ @xmath0",
    "which , from a mathematical point of view , is a functional of the _ fields _ of the model . for the @xmath1 scalar model - the simplest qft model -",
    "there is only one type of field , which we denote by @xmath2 . from a mathematical point of view , for an euclidean qft scalar model , one has @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is usually taken equal to @xmath5 ( the dimension of the space ) and @xmath6 ( real , respectively complex fields ) .",
    "the quantities computed in qft are generally divergent .",
    "one thus has to consider a real , positive , _ cut - off _ @xmath7 - the flowing parameter .",
    "this leads to a family of cut - off dependent actions , family denoted by @xmath8 .",
    "the derivation @xmath9 gives the _ renormalization group equation_.    the quadratic part of the action - the _ propagator _ of the model - can be written in the following way [ propa ] c_,_0(p , q)=(p - q)_^ de^-p^2 , with @xmath10 and @xmath11 living in the fourier transformed space @xmath12 and @xmath13 a second real , positive cut - off .",
    "in perturbative qft , one has to consider _ feynman graphs _ , and to associate to each such a graph a _",
    "feynman integral _",
    "( further related to quantities actually measured in physical experiments ) .",
    "the contribution of an edge of such a feynman graph to its associated feynman integral is given by an integral such as .",
    "one can then get ( see @xcite ) the polchinski flow equation [ eq : pol ] = _ ^2d 12 d^d p d^d q ( - ) , where @xmath14 represents the fourier transform of the function @xmath15 .",
    "the first term in the right hand side ( rhs ) of the equation above corresponds to the derivation of a propagator associated to a bridge in the respective feynman graph .",
    "the second term corresponds to an edge which is not a bridge and is part of some circuit in the graph .",
    "one can see this diagrammatically in fig .",
    "[ fig : pol ] .",
    "this equation can then be used to prove perturbative renormalizability in qft .",
    "let us also stress here , that an equation of this type is also used to prove a result of e. m. wright which expresses the generating function of connected graphs under certain conditions ( fixed excess ) . to get this generating functional ( see , for example , proposition @xmath16 the book @xcite ) , one needs to consider contributions of two types of edges ( first contribution when the edge is a bridge and a second one when not - see again fig .",

    ", one has the following definitions :    a * matroid * m is a pair @xmath17 consisting of a finite set e and a collection of subsets of e satisfying the following set of axioms : @xmath18 is non - empty , every subset of every member of @xmath18 is also in @xmath18 and , finally , if @xmath19 and @xmath20 are in @xmath18 and @xmath21 , then there is an element @xmath22 in @xmath23 such that @xmath24 is in @xmath18 .",
    "the set @xmath25 is the ground set of the matroid and the members of @xmath18 are the independent sets of the matroid",
