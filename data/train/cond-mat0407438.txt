    "diamond is a very attractive material with industrial applications because of its maximum hardness , high surface stability ( chemical inertness ) , large energy gap ( @xmath05.5 ev ) , high thermal conductivity , and so on .",
    "boron - doped diamond expands its possibility into an application of electric devices.@xcite lightly boron - doped diamond shows @xmath3-type character with an activation energy of about 0.37 ev,@xcite and heavily doped diamond shows metallic conductivity.@xcite furthermore the recent discovery of the superconductivity of more - heavily boron doped diamond brought a new attention to the problem in the superconductivity of impurity - induced metallization in semiconductor,@xcite however the crystalinity of these heavily doped compounds is not clear in contrast to the low ( @xmath6 0.5 % ) doped diamonds .",
    "it seems that boron atoms occupy the interstitial sites when heavily doped case ( @xmath04%)@xcite and substitute for carbon at low doped case ( @xmath6 0.5 % ) .@xcite it should be important to clarify the memorable electronic structure of more - heavily doped diamonds , but at present the priority study should be that of the low doped diamond due to their crystalinities .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we study the electronic structures of low doped diamond with the metallic ( @xmath01at% ) and semiconducting ( @xmath00.1at% ) characters .",
    "the partial density of states ( pdos s ) of boron- and carbon-2@xmath3 using x - ray absorption ( xas ) and x - ray emission ( xes ) spectroscopy near the b - k and c - k edges of these doped diamonds are reported .",
    "xas and xes near b - k and c - k edges are powerful techniques for direct measurement of pdos s of dopant - boron and host - carbon , especially for the semiconducting or insulating materials , in comparison with the electron spectroscopy .",
    "highly boron - doped diamond thin films were deposited on si ( 100 ) wafers in a microwave plasma - assisted chemical vapor deposition ( mpcvd ) system ( astex corp . ) .",
    "details of the preparation were described elsewhere.@xcite a mixture of acetone and methanol in the volume ratio of 9/1 was used as the carbon source .",
    "b@xmath7o@xmath8 , the boron source , was dissolved in the acetone - methanol solution at a b / c atomic ratio of 1:100 .",
    "this 1 at% boron - doped diamond , b - diamond , shows metallic conductivity at the room temperature .",
    "the lightly doped diamond film is synthesized using mpcvd method with a @xmath9-bn target ( bn - diamond).@xcite the boron and nitrogen concentrations are estimated to be 0.1at% for both boron and nitrogen by sims measurements . and the electric property is semiconducting with the activation energy @xmath10 of about 0.37 ev.@xcite however the value of @xmath10 depends on the impurity concentration , this value is consistent with the previous reports of lightly boron - doped diamond film.@xcite several values of the nitrogen - impurity levels ( deep @xmath11-type ) are reported.@xcite    soft x - ray absorption ( xas ) and xes measurements were performed at bl-8.0.1@xcite of the advanced light source ( als ) in lawrence berkeley national laboratory ( lbnl ) .",

    "for the calibrations of the monochromator and spectrometer , @xmath9-bn , b@xmath7o@xmath8 , hopg and natural diamond were used as the standard samples.@xcite although all the samples are polycrystals , there is a possibility of orientation . in order to check the orientation and the surface @xmath12-resonant state reported in some borides , polarization ( angle ) dependencies of xas and xes",

    "the activation energy , @xmath2 , of 0.37 ev was measured from the temperature dependence of the conductivity.@xcite then , the shift of 0.3@xmath00.4 ev between metallic and semiconducting samples is consistently explained by the small gap with @xmath2 of 0.37 ev . in other words , 0.1-at%b makes a shallow level near the valence band with @xmath2 of 0.37 ev .",

    "the elastic peak was assumed to be gaussian with fwhm of 0.6 ev.@xcite the result of the subtraction of the elastic peak is essentially same as before the subtraction because the width of elastic peak is narrow . because the unoccupied state , a peak at 284 ev is observed only in b - doped - diamond ,",
    "the xes spectrum with @xmath15 of 284 ev is a represent of the pdos of the carbon atom hybridized with dopant b , i.e. , nearest neighboring ( n.n . ) carbon from boron . because it is difficult to study the electronic structures of dopant ( dilute ) boron and the neighboring carbon atoms using band calculation , calculations were performed by , dvx@xmath4 method.@xcite , a cluster calculation method .",
