    "channel state information at the transmitter ( csit ) is important for optimizing wireless system performance . in the multiple - input - single - output ( miso ) broadcast channel",
    ", csit allows the transmitter to simultaneously send multiple data symbols to different receivers without creating mutual interference by using interference suppression techniques @xcite-@xcite .",
    "prior work on the miso broadcast channel focused on the csit uncertainty caused by limited rate feedback @xcite-@xcite and showed there are no degrees of freedom ( dof ) lost compared to the perfect csit case , if the csi feedback rate per user linearly increases with signal to noise ratio ( snr ) in db scale .",
    "meanwhile , it has been conjectured that csit uncertainty due to feedback delay significantly degrades the dof gain .",
    "recently , assuming only outdated csi at the transmitter , it was shown that @xcite dof gains greater than that of tdma can be achieved in the context of miso broadcast channel . the key idea from @xcite",
    "is to exploit the perfect outdated csit as side - information , which allows the transmitter to align inter - user interference between the past and the currently received signals . motivated the work in @xcite",
    ", extensions have been developed for other networks such as a single antenna 3-user interference channel @xcite and multiple antenna interference channel @xcite .",
    "the common assumption of previous work @xcite-@xcite is that the transmitter only has delayed csi .",
    "depending on the relative difference between csi feedback delay and channel coherence time , however , it may be possible for the transmitter to use current csi during a fraction of the channel coherence time as well as outdated csi when feedback delay is less than channel coherence time .",
    "if csi feedback is not too delayed , is it possible to increase the dof gain by using both outdated csi as well as current csi ? in this paper , we show that there is no dof loss compared to the case of csi feedback without delay , even if csi feedback delay exists , if the delay is less than a derived fraction of the channel coherence time .",
    "for instance , we show that the @xmath0 of dof gain ( cut - set outer bound ) are achievable for the miso broadcast channel where a transmitter having @xmath1 antennas supports @xmath2 users having a single antenna if feedback delay is less than one - third of channel coherence time .",
    "prior work conjectured that there was always a dof loss for any feedback delay . in our work , we show that there exists a csi feedback delay threshold such that it does not degrade the system performance from a dof perspective .",
    "this achievability result is shown through the construction of a new transmission method called space - time interference alignment ( stia ) .",
    "the basic idea of stia is to align inter - user interference signals between the past observed and the currently observed while providing linearly independent linear combinations of the desired symbols to the corresponding users using both outdated and current csi .",
    "further , by using the derived result and leveraging results in @xcite , we characterize a csi feedback delay - dof gain trade - off for the vector broadcast channel . through this trade - off analysis",
    ", we provide an insight into the interplay between csi feedback delay and system performance from a dof gain point of view .",
    "let us consider a @xmath3-user miso broadcast channel where a transmitter with @xmath4 multiple antennas sends independent messages to a receiver with a single antenna .",

    "we assume that the transmit power at the transmitter satisfies an average constraint @xmath12{{\\bf x}}^{*}[n]\\right)\\right ] \\leq p$ ] .",
    "further , we assume that each mobile user has perfect csi at the receiver .      in this paper , we assume that a block fading model where the fading channel values are constant for the channel coherence time @xmath13 and change independently between blocks . under the block fading model , as illustrated in fig . 1 .",
    ", each user feeds back csi to the transmitter every @xmath13 time slots where @xmath13 denotes channel coherence time .",
    "if we consider feedback delay time @xmath14 is less than channel coherence time , i.e. , @xmath15 , the transmitter acquires knowledge of csi at @xmath16 time slot after the time slot sent back csi by the users .",
    "specifically , if a user feeds back csi at time slot @xmath5 , the transmitter has csi at time slot @xmath17 in our model .",
    "let us define a parameter for the ratio between the csi feedback delay and the channel coherence time as @xmath18 we refer to the case where @xmath19 as the completely outdated csi regime as shown in @xcite",
    ". in this case , only completely outdated csi is available at the transmitter .",
    "we refer to the case where @xmath20 as the current csi point .",
    "since there is no csi feedback delay , the transmitter can employ current csi over all time slots . as depicted in fig . 1 .",
    ", if @xmath21 , the bs is able to exploit an instantaneous csi over two third of channel coherence time and outdated csi for the past channels .",
    "since the achievable data rate of users depend on the csi feedback delay and snr , it can be expressed as a function of @xmath22 and @xmath23 . using this notion , for codewords spanning @xmath5 channel uses",

    "the total sum dof characterizing the high snr behavior of the achievable rate region is defined as @xmath30",
    "the purpose of this section is to present a motivating example for the special case of @xmath2 and @xmath1 to explain the idea of the proposed algorithm , which simultaneously exploit both outdated csi and current csi so that each user sees the same interference pattern in space and time domains . through this example , we prove the following theorem .",

    "* remark 5 ( implementation issue ) * since in the dof analysis it is assumed that the transmitter sends the signal with large enough power , the beamforming solutions containing matrix inversion do not violate the transmit power constraint . in practice , however , when the transmitter has a finite power constraint , we need to modify the proposed algorithm so that the power constraint is satisfied .",
    "this modified algorithm may occur the performance loss but does not affect to the dof gain .",
    "in this section , we characterize a csi feedback delay and dof gain trade - off for the 3-user @xmath82 miso broadcast channel by using the proposed algorithm in the previous section .",
    "we first prove the following theorem .",
    "[ theorem 2 ] _ there is no dof loss for the 3-user @xmath82 miso broadcast channel when @xmath83 , i.e. , @xmath84 _    recall that zero - forcing ( zf ) achieves the optimal dof when csi feedback delay does not exist , i.e. , @xmath85 .",

    "due to one time slot feedback delay , the transmitter can acquire csi at @xmath90 and @xmath91 time slots if the user sends back csi at time slot @xmath5 . under this channel knowledge assumption , we show that @xmath92 of dof are achievable .",
    "the key idea is to divide total time slots into different subsets of slots .",
    "according to different subsets of time slots , we apply different transmission strategies : the proposed stia , zf and tdma .",
    "* time resources for stia : * for the stia algorithm , the transmitter can send two independent data symbols per user by spending three time slots where one is outdated csi and two are current csi at the transmitter .",
    "therefore , we count a set of time slots where one is outdated csi and two are current csi at the transmitter for applying the stia .",
    "suppose that the total number of time slots is @xmath93 where @xmath5 is a large positive integer .",
    "let us define an index set @xmath94 where @xmath95 .",
    "for example , as shown in fig . 1 . , if @xmath96 , there exists total @xmath97 time resources and three index sets can be defined as @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 , respectively . according to the definition of the index set",
    ", the first element , @xmath101 , corresponds to the case when outdated csi is available at the transmitter , while the second two elements , @xmath102 and @xmath103 , corresponds to the case when current csi and outdated csi is available at the transmitter .",
    "thus , we apply the proposed stia by using the time index sets .",
    "notice that since we assume that the total available time resource is @xmath93 , @xmath104 time slots , i.e. @xmath105 exist for applying stia . as a result , it is possible for the transmitter to deliver @xmath106 independent symbols to three users by spending @xmath104 time slots among the total @xmath93 time slots .",
    "* time resources for zf and tdma : * since the @xmath104 time slots have been used for stia among the total time resource @xmath93 , the remaining time resources become @xmath107 time slots .",
    "let us express the remaining time slots in terms of index as @xmath108 recall that for the time index of @xmath109 where @xmath9 is a positive integer , the transmitter sends data by using tdma because csit is not available due to feedback delay .",
    "alternatively , the transmitter delivers multiple data streams by using zf because the transmitter is able to use csi during the other time slots excepting the @xmath109-th time slot . using this observation",
    ", we decompose the remaining index set @xmath110 into two index sets for zf and tdma transmission as @xmath111 where @xmath112 and @xmath113 . for the time slots in @xmath114 , the transmitter sends two independent data symbols by using zf beamforming .",

    "similarly , if we consider time sharing method between zf and mat , it is possible to show that the @xmath128 of dof are achieved when @xmath21 .",
    "since the proposed algorithm achieves the 2 of dof when @xmath21 , we obtain the @xmath129 of dof gain over zf - tdma and @xmath130 of dof gain over zf - mat , respectively . therefore , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : trade - off_3user ] , the proposed transmission algorithm achieves the higher csi feedback delay - dof trade - off region than that obtained by the other transmission techniques .",
    "* remark 7 * : the proposed csi feedback delay - dof gain trade - off shows that if users feedback csi to the transmitter within 33@xmath131 of channel coherence time , the system performance is not degraded from a dof perspective .",
    "* example * : if we consider a lte system using @xmath132 ghz carrier frequency , which serves users with mobility of @xmath133 km / h ( walking speed ) . in this case",
    "the channel coherence time can be roughly calculated as @xmath134 msec ( two radio frames ) where @xmath135 denotes the speed of light .",
