    "+ different statistical methods have been considered for the study of the relation between wind direction and pollutants concentration , both for exploratory and for inferential analysis , taking into account that wind direction is a circular variable requiring a proper statistical treatment .",
    "wind potential assessment using descriptive methods and spectral analysis has been carried out by @xcite .",
    "in addition , wind direction has been proved to play a significant role in detection of emission sources ( see @xcite ) and air quality studies ( see @xcite ) , although the wind direction is not treated as a circular variable , but discretized as a factor .",

    "the introduction of nonnegative trigonometric sums for modelling the circular distributions involved in @xcite formulation allows for more flexible models , that may present skewness or multimodality , features that can not be reflected through the von mises distribution ( the classical model for circular variables ) .",

    "+ in this work , a procedure for modelling the relation between a circular and a linear variable is proposed .",
    "the relation is specified by a circular  linear density which , represented in terms of copulas , can be estimated nonparametrically .",
    "the estimation algorithm can be also adapted to a semiparametric framework , when an underlying model for the marginal distributions can be imposed , and it also comprises the classical johnson and wehrly model .",

    "note also that there are two dominant wind incidence directions , specifically , blowing from sw and from ne .",
    "in addition , note that the average so@xmath0 values for winds blowing from sw are remarkably high for 2004 , which is explained by the position of the monitoring station with respect to the power plant .",

    "+ obviously , the first three proposals ( jwp , jwsp , jwnp ) make sense for distributions belonging to johnson and wehrly family . however , since the marginals considered in examples 3 and 4 also belong to the von mises ( circular ) and the normal ( linear ) classes , as in examples 1 and 2 , jwsp , jwnp , csp and cnp variants of the algorithm will be applied in the last two cases .",
