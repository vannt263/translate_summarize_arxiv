    "clusters of galaxies play a major role in most of the attempts at reconstructing the cosmological history of the universe . numerical simulations ( since evrard 1990 , and then thomas & couchman 1992 , katz & white 1993 , cen & ostriker 1994 , navarro 1995 , evrard 1996 , eke 1998 , thomas 2002 , tornatore 2003 , borgani 2004 ) are a powerful tool for making predictions on their formation and evolution , provided that the underlying physical mechanisms are fully taken into account",
    ".    in particular cosmological simulations have helped to reproduce many of the x - ray properties of the intra ",
    "cluster medium ( icm ) , which is a hot ( 1 - 10 kev ) tenuous ( @xmath8 @xmath9 ) , optically thin gas containing completely ionized h and he and partially ionized heavier elements (  metals \" ) .",
    "metal lines revealed to populate spectra of both groups and clusters , corresponding to metallicities of about 0.2 to 0.4 in solar units , which indicates a non purely primordial origin of the icm , a fraction of which must have previously been processed in galaxies as inter  stellar medium ( ism ) and then transported whence into the space between galaxies .",
    "the icm is emitting radiation at x - ray wavelenghts by losing energy according to a cooling timescale @xmath10 .",
    "in the very central region of many clusters the gas density becomes high enough to make the cooling time shorter than a hubble time , forming thus a cooler core ( typically @xmath11100 kpc or more ) which affects the gas central density , temperature and entropy distributions ( see sections 3 , 4 , 5 ) .",
    "the icm has likely been heated up to x - ray emitting temperatures mainly by means of gravitational energy converted to thermal when falling onto the cluster s potential well . indeed the basic scenario describing the thermal behaviour of the icm calls for a gravity - only driven ongoing heating of the gas by adiabatic compression , followed by hydrodynamical shocks arisen during the settling of infalling material .",
    "the hot gas will emit mainly by thermal ( free - free ) bremsstrahlung , resulting in the simple , theoretical clusters x - ray scaling relations : luminosity  temperature @xmath12 , entropy  temperature @xmath13 , virial mass  temperature @xmath14 .",
    "it is by now well known how this simple model basically fails in reproducing the actual scaling properties observed : in fact , the @xmath3 relation at @xmath2 is steeper than predicted , breaking possibly into two different slopes ( see section 6 ) . as for the s - t relation , an entropy excess with respect to the self - similar expectation",
    "has been reported in the inner region of poorer and cooler systems , reaching a constant value (  entropy floor \" ) , likely resulting from softer gas density profiles in the core ( section 5 ) .",
    "finally the m - t relation has been found to have a lower normalization than predicted by ",
    "adiabatic \" models and simulations of up to @xmath15 .",
    "physical mechanisms able to explain the break of self  similarity in the properties of the icm have been extensively proposed during last ten years , and mainly fall in two broad classes : a ) non  gravitational heating and b ) radiative cooling .",
    "introducing gas cooling and star formation induces gas condensation at core scales , leading to star concentration associated with the central galaxy ( cd ) which will be dominating the baryonic cluster mass in the core at @xmath2 .",
    "this affects also the dark - matter ( dm ) density profile in the core , which steepens from @xmath16 to @xmath17 .",
    "moreover , inflows of high  entropy gas from extra  core regions are stimulated by virtue of baryon cooling , while lower - entropy , shorter - cooling time gas gets selectively removed from the centre , thus giving rise to an increased level of entropy inside the core itself ( voit & bryan 2001 ) . on the other hand x - ray luminosity",
    "is suppressed since the amount of gas populating the hot diffuse phase gets reduced ( pearce , 2000 ) .",
    "however all cluster simulations with cooling and star formation reveal a significant drawback : cooling alone makes a large fraction ( 30 up to 55% ) of gas get converted into a cold phase ( either cold gas or stars ) within the virial radius at @xmath2 ( suginohara & ostriker 1998 , balogh 2001 , dav 2001 ) , in contradiction with a value of 10 - 20% of the baryon fraction locked into stars indicated by observations .",
    "thus , additional sources of non - gravitational heating are required to counterbalance over  cooling in the cluster s core , to enhance the entropy of the gas and to suppress its x - ray emissivity ( evrard & henry 1991 , bower 1997 , lewis 2000 , bialek 2001 ) .",
    "one solution would be to appeal to pre  heating , namely episodic mechanisms such as an impulsive injection of energy to all gas particles at redshift high enough to occur either before ( external pre  heating : requires less energy to reach a given entropic level because occurring in a less dense pristine environment : e.g. kaiser 1991 , cavaliere 1997 , balogh 1999 , mo & mao 2002 ) , or during the gravitational collapse onto the cluster s potential , or shock heating during late accretion within dm haloes ( internal pre  heating : e.g. tozzi & norman 2001 , babul 2002 , voit 2003 ) : its effect would be clearly stronger for colder systems ( groups and small clusters ) , where both excess of inner entropy and a steeper l - t relation can be achieved ( cavaliere 1998 , brighenti & mathews 2001 , borgani 2001 ) .",
    "feedback processes subsequent to star formation , namely supernov  induced galactic winds , are natural mechanisms working at both pre  heating and especially metal enriching the icm ( loewenstein & mushotzky 1996 , renzini 1997 , finoguenov & ponman 1999 , wu 2000 , lloyd - davies 2000 , kravtsov & yepes 2000 , menci & cavaliere 2000 , bower 2001 , pipino 2002 , kapferer 2006 ) ; yet doubts have been raised as to the actual efficiency in thermalizing the amount of additional supernova energy , which would be maximized e.g. in starbursts .",
    "domainko  etal ( 2004 ) took into account the effect of heating and metal enrichment from intra - cluster sne , the energy from which may inhibit or delay the formation of cooling flows , provided that the inter - galactic star fraction is as considerably high as shown in other simulations ( @xmath1820 - 25% , see sommer - larsen , romeo and portinari , 2005 , hereinafter paper iii ) . up to now the most promising candidates to supply energy for heating are agns associated with quasars , which can have at their disposal huge energetic reservoirs to be converted into gas thermal energy ( bower 1997 , valageas & silk 1999ab , wu 2000 , mcnamara 2000 , yamada & fujita 2001 ; cavaliere , lapi & menci 2002 , croton 2006 ) . in conclusion ,",
    "stellar feedback and/or additional pre  heating must play together with gas cooling to regulate the latter such as to suppress over  cooling ( see pearce 2000 , kay 2003 ) : this will set up the fraction of baryons cooled out (  cold fraction \" ) to form stars and cold clouds , which in turn drives the distribution of gas density , temperature and entropy .",
    "so far few hydrodynamical simulations have been performed which were able to pursue at the same time and in a self  consistent way the target of realistically modelling the icm dynamics by including both non - gravitational heating / cooling ( complete with feedback / star formation ) _ and _ the metal enrichment associated with star formation and stellar evolution : borgani ( 2001 and 2002 ) , tornatore ( 2003 ) , mccarthy ( 2004 ) ( all though without following metal production from star formation ) , and especially valdarnini ( 2003 ) , tornatore ( 2004 ) and , very recently , scannapieco ( 2005 ) and schindler ( 2005 ) .",
    "the physical processes implemented in our simulations and the numerical details are described in section 2 . in section 3 to 6 we discuss distribution and scaling of density , temperature , entropy and luminosity of the x  ray emitting gas . in section 7 and 8",
    "we discuss the relation of the hot gas with the cold stellar component and the consequent chemical enrichment .",
    "finally , in section 9 we draw some summary and conclusions .",
    "the cosmological n - body simulation has been performed using the fly code ( antonuccio , 2003 ) for a @xmath0cdm model ( @xmath19=0.3 , @xmath20=0.7 , @xmath21=0.04 , @xmath22 , @xmath23=0.9 ) with @xmath24 collisionless dm - only particles filling an initial box of 150@xmath25 mpc at an initial redshift @xmath26 .",
    "the gravitationally bound dm haloes at @xmath1=0 were identified by a fof group - finder , with a fixed linking length ( at @xmath1=0 ) equal to 0.2 times the average initial interparticle distance ( see e.g. eisenstein & hut 1998 ) .",
    "two small groups , two large groups and two clusters were sorted out from the cosmological simulation , resampled to higher resolution and resimulated by means of an improved version of the tree - sph code described in sommer - larsen , gtz & portinari ( 2003 ; hereinafter slgp ) .",
    "we named the two clusters after `` virgo '' and `` coma '' , because of their virial size : @xmath27 and @xmath28 kev in terms of x - ray temperature ( see table 1 ) , respectively ( actually `` coma '' rather resembles a `` mini - coma''-like system , being the real coma at about 8 kev ) . for each object , all dm particles within the virial radius at @xmath2 have been traced back to the initial condition at @xmath29 , where the resolution in this `` virial volume '' has been increased ( see below ) and one sph particle has been added per each dm one , with a mass of @xmath30 , resulting in a reduced dark - matter mass @xmath31 : here and throughout this series of papers we have used a baryon mass fraction @xmath32 , generally consistent with @xmath33 from nucleosynthesis and cluster observational constraints . the mass resolution reached inside the resampled lagrangian subvolumes from the cosmological set was such that @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( the mass of star particles equals that of sph gas particles throughout the simulation , see section  2.3 ) . in one high - resolution run of the `` virgo '' cluster , it was @xmath36 and @xmath37 . in the surrounding region of these subvolumes the dm particles",
    "were increasingly resampled at coarser resolution with increasing radial distance ( see gelato & sommer - larsen , 1999 ) , leaving a buffer layer in between at intermediate resolution . as a final configuration , we have therefore an inner region corresponding to the initial virial volume and containing the highest - resolution ( 64 times the basic value ; 512 times for the high resolution run ) dm and sph particles , a buffer region of dm only particles at 8 times resolution , and finally an outer envelope of dm only particles at base resolution .",
    "softening lenghts controlling gravitational interactions among particles are @xmath38kpc and @xmath39 kpc ( for the high - resolution run : 2.7 and 1.4 @xmath25kpc , respectively ) ; they were kept constant in physical space ( meaning increasing with z in comoving coordinates ) since @xmath40 and conversely fixed in comoving coordinates at earlier times .",
    "these values of the softening lengths for the dm particles correspond to a virial mass of @xmath41 , about two orders of magnitude less than the minimum mass of our particles , which ensures that the gravitational potential is well reproduced even within gravitationally bound groups .",
    "the selected objects characteristics are listed in tables 1 and 2 ; they have all been chosen such as not to be undergoing any major merger events since @xmath42 .",
    "+ the adopted treesph code schematically includes the following features ( see table 3 ) :    * solution of entropy equation ( rather than of thermal energy ) * metal - dependent atomic radiative cooling * star formation * feedback by starburst ( and optionally agn ) driven galactic winds * chemical evolution with non - instantaneous recycling of gas and heavy elements ( h , he , c , n , o , mg , si , s , ca , fe ) * thermal conduction * meta - galactic , redshift - dependent uv field .    in the following subsections we describe in more details how star formation and feedback mechanisms work , and how we implement chemical evolution with cooling .",
    "although only a minor fraction of the baryons in groups and clusters is in the form of stars and cold gas , the icm is significantly enriched in heavy elements , with an iron abundance about 1/3 solar in iron ( e.g.  arnaud 2001 ; de grandi & molendi 2001 ; de grandi 2004 ; tamura 2004 , to quote a few recent _ bepposax _ and _ xmm _ studies ) .",
    "in fact one can show from quite general arguments that at least half and probably more of the iron in galaxy clusters resides in the hot icm with most of the remaining iron locked up in stars ( renzini 1993 ; renzini 1997 , 2004 ; portinari 2004 ) .",
    "moreover , observations of galaxy clusters up to @xmath1@xmath431 indicate that the icm metals were already widely in place at this redshift ( tozzi 2003 ) .    since the metals must have mainly or exclusively been manufactered in galaxies ( whether still existing or by now disrupted into an intra ",
    "cluster stellar population ) , efficient gas and metals outflows from these must have been substantially at work in the past ( @xmath1@xmath441 ) : we shall in the following denote these  galactic super - winds \" , and sw simulations those run with such strong wind feedback .",
    "the galactic super - winds may be driven by supernov  or hypernovae ( e.g. larson 1974 , dekel & silk 1986 , mori 1997 , mac low & ferrara 1999 , slgp ) , agns ( e.g. , silk & rees 1998 ; ciotti & ostriker 1997 , 2001 ; romano _ et al .",

    "2005 ) , or a combination of the two",
    ".    recent work on galaxy formation indicates that in order to get a significant population of disc galaxies with realistic properties in addition to steady , quasi self - regulated star formation , one has to invoke early non - equilibrium outflow processes ( e.g. , abadi 2003 , slgp , governato 2004 , robertson 2004 ) .",
    "such early star - burst driven outflows were incorporated in the simulations of slgp , and in the present simulations we build on this approach , except that in general we allow such outflows to occur at all times ( all  sw \" runs : see below ) .",
    "specifically our approach is the following : cold gas particles ( @xmath45@xmath46@xmath47k ) are triggered for star formation on a timescale @xmath48 ( where the star formation efficiency @xmath49 ) if the gas density exceeds a certain critical value , chosen to be @xmath50 @xmath9 ; we have experimented with other values and found that the outcome of the simulations is very robust with respect to changes in this parameter . to model the sub - resolution physics of star - bursts and",
    "self propagating star formation in a simplistic way we assume that , if a sph particle satisfies the above criterion and has been triggered for star formation , then with a probability @xmath51 its neighbouring cold and dense sph particles with densities above @xmath52 are also triggered for star formation on their respective dynamical time scales .",
    "the fraction @xmath53 of all stars formed which partake in bursts is controlled through the parameters @xmath54 and @xmath51 .",
    "simulations with combinations of the latter two parameters yielding similar values of @xmath53 give similar results , so effectively the wind  strength \" is controlled by one parameter . for most simulations presented in this paper",
    "we have used @xmath55 @xmath9 and @xmath51=0.1 , resulting in @xmath53@xmath560.8 .",
    "when a star particle is born , it is assumed to represent a population of stars formed at the same time in accordance with a salpeter or an arimoto - yoshii ( arimoto & yoshii , 1987 ) imf .",
    "it feeds energy back to the local ism by type ii supernov  ( snii ) explosions during the period 3 - 34 myr after formation : in fact , the lightest stars which contribute feedback from snii explosion have a mass of about 9 @xmath57 and lifetimes of about 34 myr ; and the upper limit of the imf is assumed to be 100 @xmath57 corresponding to a lifetime of about 3 myr ( see lia , portinari & carraro 2002 ) . stars with masses greater than 9 @xmath57 are assumed to deposit @xmath43 10@xmath58 ergs per star to the ism as they explode as snii . throughout , the energy output from stellar winds is neglected , because even for metal - rich stars it is an order of magnitude less than the output from snii . also produce sn  ii , mostly via the electron  capture mechanism ( portinari , chiosi & bressan 1998 ) ; however , due to the longer lifetime of the progenitors ( 3475 myr ) , these explosions are much more diluted in time and less correlated in space , giving no burst and super ",
    "shell effects .",
    "we thus neglect energy feedback from this mass range , also because the endpoint of the evolution is still debated : super  asymptotic giant branch evolution might develop in the non  violent formation of a massive white dwarf , or in a weak explosion at most ( ritossa , garcia - berro & iben 1996 , 1999 ; eldridge & tout 2004 ) . ]    snii events are associated with multiple explosions of coeval stars in young stellar ( super-)clusters , hence resulting in very efficient contribution to energy feedback . in the simulations ,",
    "the energy from sn  ii is deposited into the ism as thermal energy at a constant rate during the aforementioned period ( the energy is fed back to the , at any time , 50 nearest sph particles using the smoothing kernel of monaghan & lattanzio 1985 ) .",
    "part of this thermal energy is subsequently converted by the code into kinetic energy as the resulting shock - front expands .",
    "while a star particle is feeding energy back to its neighbouring sph particles , radiative cooling of these is switched off : this is an effective way of modelling with sph a two - phase ism consisting of a hot component ( @xmath59 k ) and a much cooler component ( @xmath60 k )  see mori @xcite , gerritsen @xcite and thacker & couchman ( 2000 and 2001 ) . at the same time interrupting cooling in the surrounding region of star particles undergoing snii explosion , helps mimicking the adiabatic phase of expansion , thus creating super - shells .",
    "such an adiabatic phase of supernov  explosion would be missed in the simulations if the whole thermal energy released were to get dissipated by efficient cooling mechanisms .",
    "the feedback related to the ( non star - burst ) conversion of individual , isolated sph particles to star particles typically results in `` fountain - like '' features , and does not lead to complete `` blow - away '' .",
    "in fact , a typical star - burst event as described above gives origin to 40 - 50 star particles which are at formation localized in space and time .",
    "the energy feedback from these star particles drives strong shocks/``super - shells '' outwards through the surrounding gas , sweeping up gas and metals and transporting these to ( and mixing into ) the icm  such outflows being the `` galactic super - winds '' we introduced .",
    "these super - winds are quite well resolved numerically  a further improvement in the present work has been the adoption of the `` conservative '' entropy equation solving scheme of springel & hernquist ( 2002 ) , which improves shock resolution over classic sph codes .",
    "the amount of energy injected into the inter stellar medium ( ism ) by type  ii supernovae per unit mass of stars initially formed can be expressed as @xmath61 , where @xmath62 normally is unity ( but see below ) , @xmath63 accounts for possible radiative losses , @xmath64 is the number of type  ii supernovae produced per unit mass of stars formed and @xmath65 is the amount of energy released per supernova . for this work",
    "we assume @xmath66=10@xmath58  ergs .",
    "the parameter @xmath64 depends on the imf : for the salpeter imf @xmath67 , for the arimoto - yoshii imf @xmath68 , corresponding to 6 and 15 snii respectively ( from progenitors with @xmath69 ) , per 1000  m@xmath70 of stars formed . to mimic the effect of possible additional feedback from central , super - massive black holes in a very crude way we set in some simulations @xmath62=2 or 4 ( swx2 and swx4 runs respectively ) , on the basis of the hypothesis that agn activity mirror star formation ( boyle & terlevich 1998 )",
    ".    as a test of reference ,",
    "one set of simulations (  wfb \" ) were run with early super - winds only , as slgp assumed for modelling individual galaxies .",
    "this resulted in a very small ( average ) value of @xmath53=0.07 , and a consequent very low level of enrichment of the icm . as a result",
    ", this wfb set has been run using an approximately primordial cooling function in the icm , and hence is similar to most of the previously attempted simulations performed without metal production from star formation and subsequent chemical evolution of the icm ( _ e .",
    "tornatore , 2003 ) .",
    "the above `` super - wind '' scheme is not resolution independent by construction , yet simulations at 8 times higher mass and twice better force resolution give similar results ( see _ e.g. _ section 6 and also paper ii ) , indicating that the scheme is effectively resolution independent .",
    "although the above scheme is just a simplistic way of modeling galactic outflows , it has the advantage that such outflows are numerically resolved , and that the gas dynamics of the outflow process is self - consistently handled by the code .    finally , type ia supernov  ( snia ) are also implemented in the simulations as sources of chemical enrichment . however , since snia explosions are considerably less numerous than snii ( per unit mass of stars initially formed ) , and also are typically uncorrelated in space and time , we neglect their energy feedback in the current simulations . as a matter of fact ,",
    "snia explosions , occurring in low - density environments , may be in principle more efficient in contributing to feedback ( recchi , matteucci & dercole 2001 ; pipino et  al .",
    "2002 ) ; nonetheless they represent isolated events not giving rise to cumulative , large scale effects such as the supershells resulting from correlated snii explosions .",
    ".structural properties of selected clusters and groups at @xmath1=0 [ t:1 ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]      the simulations show active star formation , induced by strong cooling flows , at the very centre of the cd galaxies down to @xmath2 , which has no counterpart in observed clusters ; such spurious late activity is responsible for a non negligible fraction of the cluster stellar mass and these young stellar populations would significantly contribute to the total luminosity . therefore a correction must be applied , if aiming at reproducing observed quantities such as cold fraction , star formation rate as well as the metal production and distribution in the icm ( see sections 7 and 8 ; also paper iii and donghia _ et al .",
    "_ 2005 ) .",
    "specifically , our correction consists in selecting and subtracting out the star particles formed within the innermost 10  kpc since some @xmath71 : as the main epoch of general galaxy formation in the clusters is over by @xmath72 ( see paper ii ) , we assume @xmath71=2 as the redshift below which spurious central star formation induced by cooling flows can be neglected ; we also verified that the correction is quite stable for @xmath71 up to 2.5 .",
    "there is a deep interconnection between chemical and hydrodynamical evolution when addressing metal production and mixing into the icm .",
    "stars return to the surrounding ism part of their mass , including chemically processed gas , and of their energy ( stellar feedback ) : the whole star formation process acts onto the cluster gas evolution both through energy feedback from supernov  ( see previous section ) , counteracting the cool - out of the hot gas , and through metal enrichment of the icm , which instead boosts its cooling rate .",
    "the rates of release of both energy ( sn rate ) and metals are set by the imf , which also regulates the returned fraction from the stellar to the gaseous phase : in a salpeter distribution , 30% of the stellar mass formed is returned to the gaseous phase within a hubble time , whilst in an arimoto - yoshii ( ay ) distribution the returned fraction is about 50% .    in our simulations , star formation and chemical evolution",
    "are modelled following the `` stochastic '' algorithm of lia _",
    "et  al._(2002 ; hereinafter lpc ) .",
    "when a cold gas particle is selected for star formation , it is entirely transformed to a star particle with a probability given by the star formation efficiency .",
    "the new - born collisionless star particle hosts a single stellar population ( ssp ) , namely a distribution of stellar masses ( according to the chosen imf ) all coeval and with homogeneous chemical composition , which is the composition of the gas particle that switched to a star particle . during its lifetime ,",
    "such a ssp will release gas and metals ( both newly synthesized and original ones ) .",
    "the return of gas and metals to the interstellar medium is also modelled stochastically , and a star particle will entirely `` decay '' , or `` return '' back to be a sph collisional particle , with a probability given by the returned fraction of the corresponding imf .",
    "which is to say , in simulations with the salpeter imf 30% of the star particles will return to be gas in a hubble time , while with the ay imf 50% of the star particles decay back to gas particles , overall .",
    "notice that the decay is not instantaneous : only 10% ( for salpeter , 30% for ay ) of the ssp mass is returned to the ism in the initial burst phase ( the initial 34 myr , section 2.1 ) , the rest of the decay of the star particles occurs spread over a hubble time . according to its age , a decaying star particle carries along to the gaseous phase the metals produced by the ssp in that time window ( namely , the products of the dying stars and exploding supernov  with the corresponding lifetime ) .",
    "thus the algorithm follows non  instantanoues gas recycling , as well as the corresponding delayed metal production .",
    "in particular , mass loss and metal production from intermediate and low mass stars , and the delayed chemical enrichment from snia , are accounted for .",
    "the algorithm follows the evolution of h , he , c , n , o , mg , si , s , ca and fe . full details of the algorithm can be found in lpc . among the advantages of this algorithm , the number of baryonic particles and their mass is conserved throughout the simulation : since they switch from gas to stars , and back from stars to gas , in their entirety with no splitting , @xmath73 always .",
    "some modifications have been applied to the original lpc algorithm , to adapt it to our `` starburst and supershell '' feedback scheme described in the previous section . in the first 34  myrs ,",
    "i.e.  during the starburst phase , the energy and metals released from massive stars are not implemented statistically ; rather , with the rates predicted by the corresponding imf , there is a steady release of energy and metals over the neighbouring gas particles , hence the expanding super - shell is also enriched in metals . when reaching 34  myr , a fraction of the star particles responsible for the burst are turned to sph particles , with the suitable probability to describe the actual returned gas fraction at that age ( about 10% or 30% for the salpeter or ay imf , see above ) . only from 34 myrs",
    "onwards , metal production is treated with the stochastic approach of lpc .",
    "being limited to the very early , short stages of the ssp lifetime , this modification does not hamper the correct modelling of delayed gas recycling and metal production achieved with the lpc algorithm ; but it allows a better connection between energy and metal feedback from snii in our starburst models , and a more efficient transport of the snii metals outward by the expansion of the corresponding supershell .",
    "further mixing of the metals , both the snii metals and those released by later decay of star particles , could be due to metal diffusion . in lpc ,",
    "metal diffusion was taken into account with a diffusion coefficient @xmath74 based on the expansion of individual supernova remnants ; this is relevant for modelling galactic scales , but can be neglected on cluster scales . besides , in our simulations the diffusion related to the expansion of ( multiple ) sn shells is implicit in the treatment of the winds .",
    "hence in our present simulations we neglect ( additional ) metal diffusion ( @xmath74=0 ) .",
    "a source of radiative heating is provided by a homogeneous and isotropic uv background radiation field switched on at @xmath40 and modelled after haardt & madau ( 1996 ) , to integrate the effect of sources such as agns and/or young blue galaxies .",
    "the presence of a uv field affects galaxy formation only at low temperatures , which is the case at the beginning of the process , when also heating by photo ",
    "ionization is important .",
    "moreover , at the typical densities of strongly cooling , galaxy forming gas ( @xmath75 @xmath9 ) , the primordial abundance cooling function is only significantly modified by a uv field of this kind at temperatures log@xmath76 , even at epochs when the uv intensity is largest ( @xmath77 )",
    ".    the radiative cooling rate of atomic gas closely depends on its chemical composition , whose evolution is followed in detail in the simulations ( section 2.3 ) ; in general , this dependence acts in such a way that , at a given density , the cooling efficiency increases for higher metallicity , leading to accelerated star formation . including effects owing to metal line cooling is thus decisive for modelling in a realistic way the transformation of baryons into stars , and hence the whole history of galaxy formation ( see scannapieco _",
    "et al . _ , 2005 ) .",
    "we take metal ",
    "dependent cooling consistently into account in the simulations , by means of the cooling functions of sutherland & dopita ( 1993 : sd ) : in such a way the cooling process of the gas takes place accordingly to its metal content , as resulted from the enrichment described in the previous subsection .",
    "with respect to a primordial composition of only h and he , metals in the gas affect its cooling rate mainly at temperatures @xmath78 : since the effects of the adopted uv field and of metal cooling are relevant in different temperature ranges ( below and above @xmath79 , respectively ) , to a first approximation they can be treated as independent corrections to the primordial abundance cooling function .",
    "radiative cooling is a function of the local metal abundance , calculated by the standard smoothing kernel of our code : though the metals are not spread around by diffusion , the cooling function is computed basing on the average metallicity of all neighbouring gas particles , also in order to avoid overestimating cooling from particles with high @xmath80 .    the adopted metal ",
    "dependent cooling functions of sd are given for chemical compositions mimicking those in the solar vicinity ( from solar  scaled to @xmath81enhanced at low metallicities ) .",
    "in general , the mixture of metals in the simulations ( as well as in real astrophysical objects ) does not necessarily follow the same trends as the local one .",
    "ideally , one would need cooling functions for different compositions ( different relative proportions of different elements ) since the cooling contribution from different elements , different ionization stages and different lines , depends on temperature and a global scaling with metallicity is never a perfect description . however , this is not yet possible so we link the available cooling functions to the actual composition of our gas particles , basing on the global abundance of metals _ by number _ ; in fact , what matters for the cooling efficiency is the number of coolants ( metal atoms and ions ) , rather than the abundance of metals by mass ( the `` metallicity '' @xmath80 ) : see e.g.  section 5.2 of sd",

    "cooling losses at clusters centre could then get offset by the heat flow from hotter regions , providing thence a possible explanation of the apparent absence of strong gas cool - out in observed clusters at present , which clearly calls for the presence of some additional heating .",
    "indeed , simple hydrostatic models assuming cooling and conductive heating in local equilibrium ( narayan & medvedev 2001 , voigt & fabian 2004 ) , have succeeded in reproducing the central temperature profiles , nearly isothermal with a smooth core decline ( see next section ) . on the other hand , the presence of magnetic fields would be likely to alter the effective conductivity in clusters , depending on the field configuration itself , which is a still widely debated topic ( carilli & taylor , 2002 ) .",
    "observations of sharp temperature gradients along cold fronts ( markevitch  2000 , ettori & fabian 2000 ) gives an indication that ordered magnetic fields are in fact present , strongly suppressing thermal conduction .",
    "thermal conduction was implemented in the code following cleary & monaghan ( 1990 ) , with the addition that effects of saturation in low - density gas ( cowie & mckee 1977 ) were taken into account . in all the runs including thermal conduction , we assumed a conductivity of 1/3 of the spitzer value ( e.g. , jubelgas , springel & dolag 2004 ) , given the expression for the electronic heat conductivity in an ionised plasma : @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the electron density and mean free path , depending on the electron temperature @xmath85 and on the coulomb logarithm @xmath0 .",
    "the observed gas density in clusters presents a cored profile ( usually parameterized with the  beta model \" of cavaliere & fusco femiano , 1976 ) which simulations of non  merging clusters are not able to explain , due to the underlying cuspy dm distribution ( metzler & evrard 1994 ) .",
    "the gas density profiles of clusters at different temperatures represent one first clue at their lack or breaking of self ",
    "similar scaling , colder systems having shallower internal profiles .",
    "previous simulations ( borgani 2002 ) have confirmed that the scaled density profiles appear identical as long as only gravitational heating is acting , whereas introducing sn feedback causes the core density to fall in those colder systems where the amount of energy injected per particle is comparable to the gravitational heat budget previously available ; such effect is even more pronounced when pre  heating the gas by imposing an early entropy floor .",
    "directly related to the gas profile is the cumulative gas fraction within a given radius , namely @xmath86 and more indirectly the baryon fraction @xmath87 and the stellar and cold fractions which will be further discussed in section 7 . in fig .",
    "[ fr ] the cumulative mass fractions of the gas and stellar components , along with the total baryonic one , are shown for the  virgo \" cluster .",
    "it is commonly accepted ( eke 1998 , frenk 1999 ) that simulated clusters without radiative cooling present gas ( and baryonic ) fraction profiles converging to a value close to the cosmic value at virial distances , @xmath88 , which is eventually reached at around twice the virial radius after a gradual rise . as can be seen in the fourth panel , relatively to the adiabatic run ( where @xmath89 , being @xmath90 ) , the combined effect of cooling and feedback makes @xmath91 to be shifted down by almost 20% from the core radius outwards ( _ cfr . _ with the 25% value found by kay 2004 ) , while the total baryonic profile is unaffected except at the centre , where cooling and star formation are responsible for the central rise with respect to the adiabatic profile .",
    "this is in agreement with other simulations ( kay 2004 ) pointing out that clusters simulated with stellar feedback exhibit lower gas density than non - radiative ones at overall level , the effect being prominent at the centre .",
    "in fact , while cooling removes low - entropy gas from the icm , feedback itself re - heats the gas up : both processes occurr at a rate proportional to density , therefore reaching maximum efficiency near the centre .    the dependence of the radial baryon and gas fraction on the different feedback and/or pre  heating and imf recipes can be more specifically examined .",
    "the choice of imf in practice does not affect neither the baryon nor the gas fractions , whereas the feedback strength can alter the profile : passing from weak feedback to  standard \" sw and to swx2 , the baryonic radial distribution remains almost unaffected , while less gas is turned into stars and the proportion of the hot vs.  cold component changes , as can be seen by inspection of the respective @xmath91 and @xmath92 ( fig .",
    "[ fr ] : two top panels ) .",
    "this means that ( as expected ) the stronger the super - winds , the more gas is left , which increases the cumulative ( relative ) gas fraction from 0.8 to 0.9 at virial radius : in fact , more gas is spread out at larger distances , its profile being more extended because of higher entropy  while the star fraction gets conversely reduced overall . when moving to the extreme swx4 model , the stellar content",
    "is so suppressed at the centre and the gas distribution so spread out , that the baryonic profile is also significantly affected and @xmath93 drops considerably below 0.8 within half the virial radius , getting to its full ( almost cosmic ) value well beyond the virial radius .    when adding extra pre  heating to the standard super ",
    "wind models ( third panel ) , it can be noticed that its main effect is the creation of a core in the gas distribution , which is the more extended , the larger the early energy / entropy amount injected per particle . on the whole , @xmath87 appears to be the most influenced by additional pre  heating , whereas feedback mainly affects the gas distribution ( unless very extreme feedback efficiencies are adopted ) .",
    "both the gas and total baryon fractions increase from the centre outwards , confirming that the gas distribution is flatter than that of dark matter ( david 1995 ) .    moreover , when considering the gas and baryonic profiles in simulated clusters of different mass and temperature ( but with otherwise the same physical input for feedback etc . ; fig .",

    "but it is interesting to mark as well the relative influence of the cooling and heating models when applied to different mass systems : while halo 202 still retaines much of the  virgo \" features , the profile of the smaller 215 indicates that stronger feedback has a relatively large effect on the icm distribution at outer distances ( see next subsection ) , suggesting a @xmath94 kev scale at which not only gas depletion at the centre but even expulsion from the outskirts may become relevant if stellar + agn feedback had a strength as in swx4 case .",

    "evidence for trends in the mean gas fraction with cluster temperature is ambiguous : a decrease in low  t systems would represent a significant contribution to the steepening of the @xmath3 relation ( see section 6 ) , which could be explained by both lower gas concentration and lower gas fraction ( arnaud & evrard 1999 ) , especially in models with galactic winds .",
    "several studies have found that the stellar component is predominant in lower - temperature systems , whose lower relative gas content and inflated gas distribution might be consequence of a stronger response to feedback in shallower potential wells ( metzler & evrard 1994 ) , although probably not at virial sceles : indeed this sequence appears very weak even at @xmath95 , being more evident only at inner @xmath96 , as found by roussel ( 2000 ) .",
    "sanderson ( 2003 ) have however found a  clear trend \" for cooler ( @xmath43 1 kev ) virialized systems to have a smaller mass fraction of emitting gas already at @xmath97 , which gets slightly levelled off when estimated at @xmath95 and which is anyway subject to somewhat considerable scatter . in fig .",
    "[ ft2 ] we actually find a trend in the gas fraction measured at @xmath98 with temperature , for the same feedback parameter : in fact the adiabatic curve lies well above the others ( because of no star formation ) and does not exhibit any systematic trend , whereas an increase is evident in all the ay - sw runs , as well as swx2 and swx4 ones . with this regard ,",
    "the trend we predict is in excellent agreement with the data , although the large scatter of the latter does not allow us to single out a best model among the different physical prescriptions for imf and feedback .",
    "a constant baryon fraction with size would be consistent with the similarity of @xmath93 profiles and an equally constant gas - to - stellar mass ratio ( linked to the cold fraction : see section 7 ) , as found by roussel ( 2000 ) , indicating that non - gravitational processes are not dominant in determining the properties of the icm on large scale ( see also white 1993 ) .",

    "in addition , for most clusters hosting cooling flows a fair temperature descent was reported towards the centre , after a peak at around @xmath107 , which reveals the presence of a cooling or cold innermost centre surrounded by a somewhat extended isothermal core : this feature seems to be reproduced by adiabatic simulations in the literature ( borgani 2001 , valdarnini 2003 ) , but it vanishes as soon as cooling is introduced , giving rise to an increasing temperature profile almost to the centre .",
    "it has been proposed ( voigt 2002 ) that thermal conduction , besides conventional heating , could help regulating central gas cooling : heat would be transferred from the outer layers to the centre , allowing diffuse gas to be kept at fairly low temperature ( @xmath43 1 kev ) without cooling out .",

    "their gas has a long cooling time , preventing the onset of cooling flows . the reasons for this peculiar central behaviour root in the structural preparation of these simulations : the wfb simulation , in which gas gets rapidly cooler out of @xmath112 , adopts an almost primordial cooling function due to the very low metallicity in the icm , so that cooling is far less efficient than for the other runs even in systems larger than groups ; on the other hand the weak propagation of stellar feedback from the inner sites of star formation causes the gas to get settled at the centre .",

    "all in all , it is a positive result that our simulations with supernova feedback ( with a top - heavy imf , but without other energy sources such as agns ) fairly reproduce the observed low cold fractions .",

    "et  al._(2004 ) : their simulated cluster is comparable in virial mass to our `` virgo '' , and they also present salpeter and ay imf simulations with different feedback efficiencies ; but their `` sub - grid '' treatment of star formation and feedback differs from ours .",
    "they share our same problem of too steep iron gradients , in all cases ; but their abundance ratio profiles behave quite differently from those in fig .",
    "[ sifehvc ] .",
    "their [ @xmath81/fe ] is roughly constant , solar or undersolar , over most of the cluster ; probably they find lower [ @xmath81/fe ] than we do because their feedback prescription treats snii and snia alike , while ours favours the diffusion of snii products .",
    "moreover , in the central regions ( @xmath179 ) they find a peak in [ @xmath81/fe ] due to recent star formation and snii explosions ; indeed their salpeter models a and b with `` standard '' wind parameters display profiles very similar to our sal - wfb simulation . in all our sw simulations , instead , we find at most a mild central enhancement in [ @xmath81/fe ] : our sw feedback prescription seems more efficient at contrasting late star formation at the centre of the cooling flow .",
    "_ are able to eliminate such central [ @xmath81/fe ] spikes when invoking additional agn energy input ( model c ) , but at the expense of retarding significantly the star formation history  which is not the case in our sw simulations ( paper  ii ) .",
    "one is then tempted to conclude that their `` standard '' feedback implementation is as little efficient as our wfb case , and they need to resort to `` agn powering '' to eliminate the central spike while we can do it with the sole snii energy in the sw simulation . but things are not so straightforward : in their model d ( ay imf with `` standard '' wind paramenters ) the high icm metallicity and [ @xmath81/fe]@xmath43 + 0.3 suggest a very efficienct dispersal of metals in the icm , more than in our ay - sw simulations ; their feedback implementation now looks more efficient than our sw one , hence it seems that their scheme is much more sensitive to the underlying imf . though more detailed discussion on different implementations is out of the scopes of this paper , we stress the importance of having different algorithms and codes to assess the subtle but important effects of sub - grid physics .",

    "[ sifez ] ( top panels ) shows that the overall iron abundance , and its profile , in the icm of simulated clusters is essentially unchanged from @xmath2 to @xmath6 , in very good agreement with observations .",
    "any evolution in the icm metallicity at @xmath181 is limited to the very central regions , @xmath182 , and is due to the late cooling flows and star formation at the centre of the cd ; excluding this effect , since the bulk of the stars in the cluster are formed at @xmath1832 ( papers  ii and  iii ) , at @xmath1=2 we predict somewhat lower iron metallicities , but such redshift range is not probed by observations yet .",
    "the lower panels in the figure show the evolution in [ si / fe ] , which as expected decreases in time due to the delayed iron contribution of snia with respect to the bulk of the silicon production ( from snii ) .",
    "the change in abundance ratios from @xmath2 to @xmath6 is minor , about 0.1  dex .",
    "there are indications that some evolution in the metallicity of the icm could be expected due to ram - pressure stripping of the metal richer cold gas from galaxies ( domainko 2006 )",
    ". however , further study of the redshift evolution of metallic abundances and gradients in the icm ( and in the intra - cluster light as well : see paper iii ) out of our simulated data is presently on progress .     evaluated at z=0.,width=302 ]",
    "all the results reported are based on cosmological simulations of galaxy clusters including self - consistently cooling , star formation , supernova driven galactic super - winds , chemical evolution , uv field and thermal conduction , as described in section 2 . in relation to modelling the properties of cluster gas and galaxies , especially from the chemical point of view",
    ", this represents an important step forward with respect to previous theoretical works on the subject ( see also paper ii and iii ) .    in section 3",
    "the gas distribution has been analysed , in terms of cumulative fractions of baryonic , gas and stellar components . when compared with the  adiabatic \" model ( no cooling / star formation ) , the combined effect of cooling and feedback in our simulations",
    "makes the gas fraction shift significantly down at all distances . enhancing feedback ,",
    "the fraction of gas turned into stars decreases , thus augmenting the cumulative gas fraction up to the virial radius ; and at the same time more gas is spread out at larger distances , resulting into a more extended profile ( fig .",
    "1 )  this effect becoming even more evident when looking at smaller systems ( fig .",
    "3 ) . from comparing gas distributions reached at @xmath98 in systems of different size , we find that feedback and cooling combined together again introduce a trend , with respect to the  adiabatic \" run , which is increasing with temperature and which is more prominent in the stronger feedback and in the pre - heating models ( fig .",
    "4 ) ; this in turn drives the baryon fraction temperature correlation , as the stellar fraction seems to follow a fairly constant behaviour which might be compatible with a similarity of the star formation process in systems over a significant mass range .    in modelling the temperature profiles ( section 4 ) ,",
    "fair agreement has been found with observed distribution from @xmath184 outwards , while an extended isothermal core and the positive gradient in the innermost regions ( @xmath182 ) are still lacking in most models ; feedback and pre  heating help to smooth out the steep negative temperature gradient typical of simulations with cooling , yet the temperature profile remains more sharply peaked than the observed one ( fig .",
    "thermal conduction is found to affect the higher temperature , more massive systems in such a way that outer radial temperature gradients are reduced and  cold fronts \" are smoothed out .    as for the entropy profiles , we needed to appeal to the most extreme swx4 scheme in order to lower the central density to values consistent with the presence of an entropy - floor at @xmath185kev@xmath115@xmath116 , and even higher in the smaller - scales simulated systems .",
    "the observed level and slope of the @xmath3 relation are also best reproduced by strenghtening the feedback up to the swx4 case , at least in the probed range 1 - 6 kev ; otherwise , the low - entropy gas at the cluster s centre induces over - emissivity , as seen in other simulations .",
    "although general results from temperature and entropy distributions still call for the need of balancing cooling by enhancing feedback , it is however a firm result that our ay - sw models can actually fit cold - core systems , reproducing observed values of central entropy at 10 - 20 kev@xmath115@xmath116 .    the findings on the mass - to - light ratio of the icm and the cold fraction place both in a fair agreement with observations , when adopting the standard sw scheme for stellar feedback with a top - heavy imf , while a salpeter imf yields too large stellar fractions and masses , giving rise to an excess optical luminosity as it is evident from the radial profiles ( fig .",
    "the cold fraction scales with cluster size , decreasing as system mass or temperature increases , as observed ; in the simulations this trend is due to the more extended gas distribution , and the smaller gas and baryonic fraction within @xmath98 , characterizing systems of lower mass and temperature , rather than to an increase in the efficiency of galaxy formation and in the stellar fraction .    in section 8",
    "the metal enrichment of the icm has been analysed .",
    "it has been found that the iron abundance profiles show a steep inner gradient , and an iron abundance overall level which is somewhat low relative to observations , at least at @xmath186 .",
    "the steep inner gradient , along with the high iron level within this inner part , is mostly due to the excessive star formation , with subsequent chemical evolution , resulted from the spurious , late - time central cooling flows .",
    "this problem would be cured , if e.g. some non - supernova related feedback mechanisms could be invoked for halting the cooling flows ( see below ) .",
    "regarding the overall level of iron abundance , it is clear from our results that adopting a top - heavier imf such as arimoto - yoshii rather than a salpeter one , helps to improve the distribution considerably . enhancing the feedback then helps to balance the partition between metals in stars and in the icm , favouring a higher iron mlr of the icm , but this comes at the expense of hampering star formation and metal production itself , resulting in a too low metallicity for the icm . rather than a stronger stellar feedback ,",
    "an improved understanding of the cooling and heating processes in the very central regions and of the formation of the cd seems to be the key to better balancing the total iron content of the stars and icm . in fact , when excluding from the stellar iron mass the iron produced by stars formed at the base of the cooling flow , the metal partition between stars and icm gets skewed in favour of the latter , thus much closer to empirical estimates .",
    "then realistic values of metal enrichment through the icm are attained , as seen from the cumulative iron masses in `` coma '' and `` virgo '' modelled and well reproduced by ay - sw scheme ( fig .",
    "and at the same time , such cooling flow correction helps the cold fraction as well to get reduced to values lower than 20% , excellently matching those observed ( figs .",
    "12 - 13 ) .",
    "besides iron , the distribution of silicon as tracer of @xmath81-elements from snii in the icm shows a non - constant , increasing radial trend with respect to iron abundance , where the ay - sw model is fairly efficient in preventing the central peak due to recent star formation , as is clear from comparison with the wfb case ( fig .",
    "although the evolution of the thermal and chemical properties of the icm over significant redshift ranges will be in perspective treated in another forthcoming paper , here we just stress the attention upon the behaviour of gas metal abundances since @xmath1=2 : iron levels appear to remain essentially unchanged at least from @xmath1=1 to the present ; silicon abundance with respect to iron instead decreases due to the delayed contribution of snia ( fig . 20 ) .    in summary ,",
    "although we can reproduce many observed features of groups and clusters , our results point out the need of a general heating mechanisms which could be able to suppress the overproduction of stars at late times in the central cluster regions , without affecting the overall cluster star formation .",
    "hot unstable buoyant bubbles as observed in x  ray ( e.g. ensslin & heinz , 2002 for a model ) , released in association with agn jets , can transport energy by convection , thus providing a means of keeping the central gas from cooling .",
    "another possibility is that the icm might contain random magnetic fields of sufficient strength to significantly reduce the gas inflow by the combined effect of magnetic pressure and reconnection .",
    "yet another option could be dissipation of sound waves resulting from agn induced , turbulent motions , as recently proposed by fujita & suzuki ( 2005 ) .",

    "<S> we have performed a series of n - body / hydrodynamical ( treesph ) simulations of clusters and groups of galaxies , selected from a cosmological volume within a @xmath0cdm framework : these objects have been re - simulated at higher resolution to @xmath1=0 , in order to follow also the dynamical , thermal and chemical input on to the icm from stellar populations within galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations include metallicity dependent radiative cooling , star formation according to different imfs , energy feedback as strong starburst - driven galactic super - winds , chemical evolution with non - instantaneous recycling of gas and heavy elements , effects of a meta - galactic uv field and thermal conduction in the icm . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> i of a series of three , we derive results , mainly at @xmath2 , on the temperature and entropy profiles of the icm , its x - ray luminosity , the cluster cold components ( cold fraction as well as mass  to  light ratio ) and the metal distribution between icm and stars . in general , models with efficient super - winds ( produced by the action of supernov  and , in some simulations , of agns ) , along with a top - heavy stellar imf , are able to reproduce fairly well the observed @xmath3 relation , the entropy profiles and the cold fraction : both features are found to be needed in order to remove high - density and low - entropy cold gas at core scales , although additional alternative feedback mechanisms would still be required to prevent late time central cooling flows , and subsequent overproduction of stars and heavy elements at the centre </S>",
    "<S> . observed radial icm temperature profiles can be matched , except for the gradual decline in temperature inside of @xmath4  0.1@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> metal enrichment of the icm gives rise to somewhat steep inner iron gradients ; yet , the global level of enrichment compares well to observational estimates when a top  heavy imf is adopted , and after correcting for the stars formed at late times at the base of the cooling flows , the metal partition between stars and icm gets into good agreement with observations . </S>",
    "<S> the overall abundance and profile of iron in the icm is found essentially unchanged from @xmath6 to present time . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the @xmath7 of the gas is found to increase steadily with radius , decreasing over time .    </S>",
