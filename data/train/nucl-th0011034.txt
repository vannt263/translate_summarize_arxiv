    "with results from the sample experiment available @xcite , there is now great interest in parity - violating electron - deuteron scattering . the sample collaboration measures at bates the longitudinal asymmetry in polarized quasi - elastic electron scattering on the proton @xcite and deuteron @xcite .",
    "the asymmetries are sensitive to the nucleon s strange magnetic and axial form factors .",
    "if other effects are under control , the two measurements can be used to determine the values of the form factors at @xmath6 gev@xmath2 . neglecting two - nucleon current effects , preliminary results are in disagreement with theoretical estimates , in particular for the axial contribution @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the work presented here is to compute a theoretical value for the deuteron asymmetry including two - nucleon currents .",
    "neutral charge and current one - nucleon operators are well known ( see , for example , ref .",
    "the contribution of such operators to the asymmetry was computed at various momentum transfers in ref .",
    "several theoretical issues were studied in detail . for the kinematical region relevant to sample",
    ", final - state interactions were found to be important .",
    "it was also found that ( except for very low momentum transfers ) the asymmetry in the vicinity of the quasi - elastic peak is fairly independent of the choice of two - nucleon ( @xmath7@xmath7 ) potential .",
    "two - nucleon charge and current operators have also been studied to some extent .",
    "heavy - meson exchange contributions were considered in ref .",
    "they were shown to be unimportant in a calculation of the asymmetry that neglected final - state interactions . in ref .",
    "@xcite , an impulse approximation modified to incorporate gauge invariance was employed .",
    "the effects of parity - violating @xmath7@xmath7 interactions on the deuteron wave function were found to be small .",
    "pion - exchange currents were included in the computation of the asymmetry , but only in electromagnetic sector .    in the present work",
    "we extend these earlier calculations .",
    "the leading currents are calculated in chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) @xcite supplemented by a successful phenomenological model @xcite .",
    "the one - nucleon currents considered here include phenomenological form factors and have the same form as those in ref .",
    "we also consider pion - exchange currents in both electromagnetic and weak contributions , as well as effects from heavier mesons , evaluated using the riska prescription @xcite .",
    "the asymmetry is calculated with deuteron and final - state wave functions obtained from a realistic potential , the argonne @xmath4 model @xcite .",
    "we present results for the kinematical region of interest to sample .",
    "( our calculation can be repeated at other momentum transfers , such as those of the planned sample - lite experiment @xcite and jlab s g0 experiment @xcite . )",
    "we verify that when two - nucleon effects are turned off , our results are in agreement with those of ref .",
    "we study the effects of two - body currents on the asymmetry , both near the quasi - elastic peak where one - body processes should dominate , and away from the quasi - elastic peak where these two - body currents could be important .",
    "we are able to confirm that most of the two - nucleon contributions to the asymmetry are due to currents of pion range .",
    "our results show that near the quasi - elastic peak two - body currents give a small contribution to the asymmetry . away from the peak ,",
    "they become more important , and can increase the magnitude of the asymmetry by as much as 3% .",
    "we find that the contribution to the asymmetry associated with the electromagnetic - axial current interference response function is about 20% .",
    "the overall effect of two - nucleon currents on the data of the sample experiment is indeed small but not negligible , and is being incorporated in the data analysis @xcite .",

    "the two terms proportional to @xmath72 in @xmath73 are the well known darwin - foldy and spin - orbit relativistic corrections  @xcite , respectively .",
    "the dipole parametrization is used for the isoscalar ( @xmath74 ) and isovector ( @xmath75 ) combinations of the electric and magnetic nucleon form factors ( including the galster form for the electric neutron form factor  @xcite ) .",
    "the most important features of the two - body parts of the electromagnetic current operator are summarized below .",
    "the reader is referred to refs .",
    "@xcite for a derivation and listing of their explicit expressions .",
    "the two - body current operator has `` model - independent '' and `` model - dependent '' components , in the classification scheme of riska  @xcite .",
    "the model - independent terms are obtained from the two - nucleon interaction ( in the present study the argonne @xmath4 interaction  @xcite is employed ) , and by construction satisfy current conservation with it .",
    "the leading operator is the isovector `` @xmath76-like '' current obtained from the isospin - dependent spin - spin and tensor interactions .",
    "the latter also generate an isovector `` @xmath77-like '' current , while additional model - independent isoscalar and isovector currents arise from the isospin - independent and isospin - dependent central and momentum - dependent interactions .",
    "these currents are short - ranged and numerically far less important than the @xmath76-like current .",
    "the model - dependent currents are purely transverse and therefore can not be directly linked to the underlying two - nucleon interaction .",
    "the present calculation includes the isoscalar @xmath78 and isovector @xmath79 transition currents as well as the isovector current associated with excitation of intermediate @xmath80-isobar resonances ( for the values of the various coupling constants and cutoff masses in the monopole form factors at the meson - baryon vertices , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . among the model - dependent currents , those associated with the @xmath80-isobar are the most important ones . in the present calculation , these currents are treated within the static @xmath80 approximation . while this is sufficiently accurate for our purposes here , it is important to realize that such an approach can lead to a gross overestimate of @xmath80 contributions in electro - weak transitions ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of this issue within the context of neutron and proton radiative captures on deuteron and @xmath81he , and the proton weak capture on @xmath81he ) .",
    "finally , it is worth pointing out that the contributions associated with the @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80-excitation mechanisms are , in the regime of low to moderate momentum - transfer values of interest here ( @xmath82 @xmath83 ) , typically much smaller than those due to the leading model - independent @xmath76-like current  @xcite .",
    "while the main parts of the two - body currents are linked to the form of the two - nucleon interaction through the continuity equation , the most important two - body charge operators are model - dependent , and should be considered as relativistic corrections .",
    "indeed , a consistent calculation of two - body charge effects in nuclei would require the inclusion of relativistic effects in both the interaction models and nuclear wave functions .",
    "there are nevertheless rather clear indications for the relevance of two - body charge operators from the failure of the impulse approximation in predicting the deuteron tensor polarization observable  @xcite , and charge form factors of the three- and four - nucleon systems  @xcite .",
    "the model commonly used  @xcite includes the @xmath76- , @xmath77- , and @xmath42-meson exchange charge operators with both isoscalar and isovector components , as well as the ( isoscalar ) @xmath78 and ( isovector ) @xmath79 charge transition couplings , in addition to the single - nucleon darwin - foldy and spin - orbit relativistic corrections .",
    "the @xmath76- and @xmath77-meson exchange charge operators are constructed from the isospin - dependent spin - spin and tensor interactions ( those of the argonne @xmath4 here ) , using the same prescription adopted for the corresponding current operators .    it should be emphasized , however , that for @xmath84 @xmath83 the contributions due to these two - body charge operators are very small when compared to those from the one - body operator .      in the standard model the vector part of the neutral weak current",
    "is related to the isoscalar ( @xmath74 ) and isovector ( @xmath75 ) components of the electromagnetic current , denoted respectively as @xmath85 and @xmath86 , via    @xmath87    and therefore the associated one- and two - body weak charge and current operators are easily obtained from those given in the preceding section .    the axial charge and current operators too have one- and two - body terms .",
    "only the axial current    @xmath88    enters in the calculation of the asymmetry .",
    "the axial charge operator is not needed in the present work .",
    "the one - body axial current is given , to lowest order in @xmath89 , by    @xmath90    where the nucleon axial form factor is parametrized as    @xmath91    here @xmath92 is the nucleon axial coupling constant , @xmath93 , and the cutoff mass @xmath94 is taken to be 1 gev / c@xmath2 , as obtained from an analysis of pion electroproduction data  @xcite and measurements of the reaction @xmath95  @xcite .",
    "there are relativistic corrections to @xmath96 as well as two - body contributions arising from @xmath76- , @xmath77- , @xmath97-exchange mechanisms and @xmath80 excitation  @xcite .",
    "all these effects , however , are neglected in the present study .",
    "the reasons for doing so are twofold : firstly , axial current contributions to the asymmetry are small , since they are proportional to the electron neutral weak coupling @xmath98 ( see eq .  ( [ eq : asy ] ) ) ; secondly , axial contributions from two - body operators are expected to be at the @xmath99 % level of those due to the one - body operator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : axc1 ] ) .",
    "for example , in the proton weak capture on proton at kev energies  @xcite",
    " this process is induced by the charge - changing axial weak current  the @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath97 , and",
    "@xmath80 two - body operators increase the predicted one - body cross section by 1.5% .",
    "such an estimate is expected to hold up also in the quasi - elastic regime being considered here .",
    "the purpose of this section is to relate the operators presented in sections [ sec : emop ] and [ sec : weop ] to chpt .",
    "we consider only up and down quarks , in which case the qcd lagrangian has an approximate @xmath100 chiral symmetry .",
    "this symmetry is spontaneously broken by the vacuum to the diagonal @xmath101 subgroup , and three pseudoscalar goldstone bosons , the pions @xmath102 , appear in the spectrum .",
    "chiral symmetry provides important constraints on the description of low - momentum processes involving pions .",
    "in particular , it allows one to estimate the relative size of various contributions .    to accomplish this ,",
    "the most general effective lagrangian with broken @xmath100 is constructed .",
    "this effective lagrangian includes terms with arbitrary number of derivatives and powers of the quark masses , however higher - dimension operators are suppressed by inverse powers of the characteristic mass scale of qcd , @xmath103 gev .",
    "thus pion interactions are determined as a power series in @xmath104 , where @xmath41 is the typical external three - momentum . at low energies",
    "this is a small number and hence only the lowest - order terms are considered in this paper .",
    "we start with the @xmath105 and @xmath106 lagrangians .",
    "details can be found , for example , in refs .",
    "we lump the pions in a field @xmath107 , where @xmath108 mev is the pion decay constant .",
    "we denote the nucleon field of velocity @xmath109 and spin @xmath110 by @xmath7 . in order to obtain the currents required for the computation of the asymmetry we must use the proper covariant derivatives .",
    "the covariant derivatives on the pion and nucleon field are constructed in terms of external vector and axial - vector fields @xmath111 and @xmath112 in the usual manner .",
    "they are given by @xmath113 @xmath114n - \\frac{\\rm i}{2}\\bigg [ u^{\\dagger}({\\cal v}_{\\mu}^{(3)}+{\\cal a}_{\\mu}^{(3)})u     + u ( { \\cal v}_{\\mu}^{(3)}-{\\cal a}_{\\mu}^{(3)})u^{\\dagger}\\bigg ] n      -3{\\rm i}\\,{\\cal v}_{\\mu}^{(0)}n,\\ ] ] where the superscripts @xmath115 and @xmath116 denote isoscalar and isovector components .",

    "one can also write down interactions containing four or more nucleon fields @xcite , which are important for a fully consistent description of systems involving two or more nucleons .",
    "one and two - body currents can be obtained from these interactions .",
    "the symmetries allow an infinite number of interactions , so an ordering scheme is necessary for predictive power .",
    "we want to estimate the size of matrix elements of one- or two - body currents between @xmath7@xmath7 wave functions .",
    "these matrix elements involve : the final @xmath7@xmath7 wave function , a two - nucleon propagator , the current operator , another two - nucleon propagator , and the initial @xmath7@xmath7 wave function .",
    "each two - nucleon propagator brings a factor @xmath129 , and each loop a @xmath130 .",
    "apart from loops in the operators themselves , matrix elements of one- and two - body operators involve , respectively , one and two loops .",
    "let us first consider only strong interactions between nucleons @xcite .",

    "electromagnetic interactions between nucleons are clearly higher - order effects , also included in the @xmath4 potential .",

    "let us denote these contributions by @xmath138 .",
    "how does @xmath138 compare to @xmath29 ?",
    "direct @xmath139 exchange between nucleons is an @xmath140 effect , so suppressed by @xmath141 compared to the strong interaction . on the other hand ,",
    "the electron - deuteron interaction is @xmath142 larger in @xmath138 than in @xmath29 . as a consequence , the contribution from @xmath0 exchange between nucleons to @xmath138",

    "since we are interested in @xmath144 , this is @xmath145 , a small effect .",

    "as we have seen , two - body currents in @xmath29 are suppressed by @xmath136 compared to the leading one - body effect .",

    "there exist also potentially larger contributions to @xmath138 .",
    "the size of the parity - violating pion - nucleon coupling might be as large as @xmath148 compared to the parity - conserving coupling @xcite .",
    "in this case pion exchange in the one - body current ( anapole form factor ) , in the potential and in the two - body current could all produce an effect @xmath149 compared to two - nucleon effects in direct @xmath0 exchange .",
    "our calculation involves all contributions suppressed by @xmath136 ( and also some even more suppressed ) compared to leading , except for @xmath138 .",

    "are negligible , less than 1% , while away from the quasi - elastic peak they become relatively more important , increasing the asymmetry by at the most 3% .",
    "note , however , that the two - body current contributions are large in the inclusive cross section , indeed dominant in the left - hand side of the quasielastic peak . in this region",
    "the contribution associated with the currents of pion range is more than 50% of the total two - body contribution .",
    "it is interesting to examine more closely the reasons for the relative unimportance of two - body current contributions in the asymmetry . at backward angles ,",
    "the expression for the asymmetry can be approximated as    @xmath213    where terms proportional to the longitudinal response functions are suppressed by the factor @xmath214 , a small number at the angles under consideration here ( note that the @xmath215 and @xmath216 response functions are of the same order of magnitude ) .",
    "it is useful to identify the contributions from @xmath208 and @xmath217 @xmath3 final states , and to use eqs .",
    "( [ eq : iso1 ] ) and ( [ eq : iso2 ] ) , relating the @xmath218 to @xmath219 .",
    "one then finds :    @xmath220    note that the @xmath221 response function only receives contributions from @xmath217 @xmath3 final states , since the current @xmath96 is isovector .",
    "the ratio @xmath222 is much smaller than one , since the transverse response is predominantly isovector .",
    "for example , at @xmath223 mev and @xmath224 , @xmath225 mev@xmath226 and @xmath227 mev@xmath226 , and hence @xmath228 with one - body ( full ) currents .",
    "in contrast , the ratio @xmath229 is of order one ; again at @xmath223 mev and @xmath224 , @xmath230 mev@xmath226 , and hence @xmath231 with one - body ( full ) currents .",
    "however , it is multiplied by the small factor @xmath232 , and so the asymmetry turns out to be largely independent of nuclear structure details .    finally , if @xmath233 denotes the asymmetry obtained by ignoring the contribution of the axial current , one finds    @xmath234    the computed value for this ratio is shown in fig . [ f14 ] for one of the kinematics of the sample experiment .",
    "the contribution of the axial current to the asymmetry is of the order of 13% to 24% throughout the kinematical range considered",
    ". note that in fig .",
    "[ f14 ] we have included the small contribution from the longitudinal response .    as a last remark , we should emphasize that the calculated transverse ( @xmath235 ) and longitudinal ( @xmath194 ) response functions including one- and two - body operators reproduce @xcite existing bates data @xcite .",
    ".25 cm    since we have performed the computations at the sample kinematics , the above results may be used to account for two - body current corrections in the analysis of the experimental data .",
    "the sample experiment measures a convolution of the asymmetry @xmath236 and the cross section @xmath237 over a certain range of electron final energies : @xmath238 the goal of the experiment is to extract the one - body part of @xmath239 . to accomplish this , a model that includes only one - body contributions",
    "is used to generate the cross section .",
    "one can now use our results for the ratios of total to one - body contributions in the asymmetry and cross section to adjust for two - body effects in the experiment .    in conclusion",
    ", we have presented a fairly complete calculation of the asymmetry in quasi - elastic electron - deuteron scattering arising from @xmath0 exchange .",
    "since we find that , when the cross section is large at the quasi - elastic peak , the change in the asymmetry due to two - body currents is negligible , we expect that these two - body corrections will produce a modification in the analysis of the sample experiment at the % level , too small to affect significantly the extraction of the strange and axial form factors of the nucleon .",
    "it remains to be examined whether the same holds for effects from @xmath0 exchange that manifest themselves within the two - nucleon system through the parity - violating pion - nucleon coupling .",
