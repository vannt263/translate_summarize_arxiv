    "the bloch vector  @xcite provides a representation of the quantum states of a two - level system in terms of real observables , and allows the identification of quantum states with points in a closed ball in 3d euclidean space , the bloch ball , which has proven to be extremely useful . in quantum information theory , for instance",
    ", the states of a single qubit can be identified with points on the surface of the bloch ball ( if the state is pure ) or points inside the ball ( if the state is mixed ) .",
    "unitary operations can be interpreted as rotations of this ball , and dissipative processes as linear or affine contractions of the bloch ball  @xcite .",
    "naturally , many efforts have been made to generalize the bloch ball to higher dimensions by defining a generalized coherence vector similar to the bloch vector for two - level systems . however , while it is easy to define a bloch  @xcite or general coherence vector  @xcite for @xmath3-level systems , it has become clear that the geometry of quantum states in higher dimensions is far more complex than in the two - level case .",
    "some efforts have been made at determining the set of bloch vectors corresponding to physical states for higher dimensional systems using the higher trace invariants or casimir invariants , for instance by kimura  @xcite , who also demonstrated the complicated and asymmetric structure of the set of bloch vectors in higher dimensions .",
    "byrd and khaneja @xcite independently provided a similar characterization of the positivity of the density matrix in terms of the coherence vector representation .    in this paper",
    "we pursue a different approach to study the structure of quantum states for higher dimensional systems , and the origin of the difference between the two - level case and higher dimensions . in section",
    "ii we define a natural stratification of the set of density matrices in terms of unitary orbits .",
    "we show that the unitary orbits can be identified with flag manifolds and determine their dimensions . for two - level systems",
    "this stratified set can be identified with a smooth real manifold with boundary , the 3d bloch ball , with strata given by concentric spheres .    in section iii",
    "we briefly review the definition of the bloch vector and define a general coherence vector , which can be naturally embedded into a closed ball in @xmath1 .",
    "this embedding is surjective for two - level systems , hence allowing the identification of physical states with points in this closed ball .",
    "we show that for higher dimensional systems , however , the embedding is never surjective due to positivity constraints , and the dimensions of the orbit manifolds vary depending on the _ multiplicities _ of the eigenvalues of the states in each stratum .",
    "furthermore , for two - level systems there exists a total ordering of the strata given by the length of the bloch vector , or the distance of the unitary orbit from the center of the bloch ball ",
    "the bloch vector of pure states has length one , and the shorter the bloch vector , the more mixed the state is . for higher dimensional systems",
    "we show that the length of the coherence or generalized bloch vector is no longer a sufficient measure for the disorder of the system .",
    "a detailed analysis of the three - level case concludes section iii .",
    "finally , in section iv we briefly consider a refined stratification of the set of density matrices defined by the action of the symplectic group .",
    "the symplectic group is of interest because it occurs naturally for quantum systems with certain dynamical symmetries ( such as atomic systems with degenerate energy levels ) and it is the only proper subgroup of the unitary group that acts transitively on certain unitary orbits @xcite .",
    "we show that the symplectic orbits of pseudo - pure states agree with the unitary orbits and provide bounds on the dimensions of other symplectic orbits , showing that the symplectic orbits generally have much lower dimension . from a control point of view",
    "this means that a @xmath4-dimensional hamiltonian control system with dynamical lie group @xmath5 is pure - state controllable but we can not control generic ensembles .",
    "throughout this paper we restrict our attention to quantum systems whose hilbert space is a finite - dimensional complex vector space @xmath6 , where @xmath0 is an integer greater than one , and for simplicity we will often use @xmath7 to denote @xmath8 with the standard hermitian inner product @xmath9 .",
    "any physical state of this system can be represented by a density operator , i.e. , a positive semi - definite ( self - adjoint ) linear operator with trace one .",
    "the subset of rank - one density operators corresponds to pure states of the system , all other density operators to mixed states .    in the following",
    "we denote the set of all positive semi - definite operators on @xmath7 by @xmath10 , the subset of all density matrices by @xmath11 , and the subset of pure states by @xmath12 .",
    "we also define the class of pseudo - pure states or pure - state - like ensembles as the set of density operators @xmath13 whose spectrum consists of exactly two distinct eigenvalues with multiplicities one and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "it is well known that @xmath11 forms a convex subset of the set of hermitian matrices since given two density matrices @xmath15 , the straight line path defined by @xmath16 for @xmath17 $ ] is contained in @xmath11 . to see this , note that @xmath18 is hermitian , @xmath19 and @xmath20 for all @xmath21 and @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "we define the orbit of a quantum state @xmath22 under the action of the dynamical lie group @xmath23 to be the set @xmath24 .",
    "the orbits endow the set of quantum states with the structure of a stratified set . in principle",
    ", any lie group @xmath23 acting on the set of density operators defines a stratification of @xmath11 .",
    "however , the orbits under the action of @xmath25 are of particular interest since they determine the most general evolution of the quantum states in a closed system . from a control point of view",
    ", the unitary orbit of a state represents the maximal set of states that are reachable from the given state via ( open - loop ) coherent control , or in the language of quantum computing , by applying a unitary gate to the state .",
    "before we attempt to classify the orbits , we recall the following standard result from linear algebra :    [ prop : a ] let @xmath26 and @xmath27 be two density matrices .",
    "the following are equivalent :    1 .",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath27 are unitarily equivalent , i.e. , @xmath28 for some unitary matrix @xmath29 .",
    "2 .   @xmath26 and @xmath27 have the same spectrum , i.e. , the same eigenvalues including multiplicity .",
    "@xmath30 for all @xmath31 .",
    "this result shows immediately that the orbit of a density matrix under @xmath32 is uniquely determined by its spectrum , i.e. , two density matrices belong to the same unitary orbit if and only if they have the same eigenvalues @xmath33 with the same multiplicities @xmath34 .",
    "each orbit @xmath35 can therefore be represented by a canonical diagonal density matrix of the form @xmath36 where the eigenvalues shall be ordered such that @xmath37 for @xmath38 to ensure a unique representation .",
    "since the @xmath33 can be arbitrary real numbers in @xmath39 $ ] provided they satisfy @xmath40 , we see immediately that there are infinitely many distinct orbits corresponding to the ( uncountably ) infinitely many possible choices for the @xmath33 .",
    "thus , we can say that the unitary group @xmath32 partitions the set of density matrices @xmath11 into an uncountably infinite family of ( distinct ) orbits or strata .    we can define a ( partial ) ordering on this stratification via majorization .",
    "let @xmath26 , @xmath27 be two density operators with eigenvalues @xmath41 , @xmath42 , counted with multiplicity and ordered in a nonincreasing sequence .",
    "@xmath43 if @xmath44 for instance , @xmath45 since @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "majorization has been shown to be a useful way to compare the degree of disorder of physical systems  @xcite and naturally defines a partial ordering on the unitary orbits ( strata ) via @xmath49 if @xmath50 $ ] and @xmath51 . however , note that only some orbits can be compared that way .",
    "consider @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "we have @xmath54 but @xmath55 .",
    "hence , neither orbit majorizes the other .    to determine the nature of the strata given by the orbits , we define the _ isotropy subgroup _ or stabilizer at @xmath22 as the subgroup @xmath56 of elements in @xmath23 that leave @xmath22 invariant ,",

    "we shall show that the orbit of an element @xmath58 under the unitary group @xmath32 can be identified with a certain type of manifold called a flag manifold .",
    "for the purpose of proving this result we observe that @xmath32 is a compact lie group and hence a compact topological group endowed with a group structure that allows us to `` multiply '' elements of the space and compute inverses such that both operations are continuous with respect to the topology .",
    "the unitary group , for instance , is a multiplicative group since multiplication of two unitary matrices gives a unitary matrix , every unitary matrix has an inverse given by the hermitian conjugate , and the identity provides a neutral element .",
    "furthermore , as a subset of the complex matrices the unitary group is naturally endowed with a topology that allows us to separate two unitary matrices by open sets , and matrix multiplication and hermitian conjugation are continuous with respect to this topology . ] and the space of density matrices is a hausdorff space , and we have the following result ( see @xcite , for instance ) :    [ prop : b ] if @xmath23 is a compact topological group acting on a hausdorff space @xmath59 and @xmath60 is the isotropy group at @xmath61 then the map @xmath62 is a homeomorphism .",

    "i.e. , the orbit manifolds for higher dimensional systems can _ never _ be _ identified _ with spheres in a higher dimensional euclidean space .",
    "that is , although we can always _ embed _ the quantum states of the system in a compact subset ( closed ball ) of a real vector space of sufficiently high dimension , there is no one - to - one correspondence between spheres in this ball and orbits of quantum states , _ except for @xmath2 _ , which explains the difficulties one encounters when trying to generalize intuitive reasoning valid for the bloch ball for @xmath2 to bloch vectors in higher dimensions .",
    "for a two - level system any density operator can be expanded as @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the 2d identity matrix , and @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 are the usual ( unnormalized ) 2d pauli matrices .",
    "the coordinates @xmath61 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 are real since the pauli matrices are hermitian and @xmath119 for @xmath120 .",

    "the resulting real vector @xmath131 is the bloch vector of the @xmath0-dimensional system .",
    "although the bloch vector defined above is useful , it is generally more elegant , and often more convenient , to work with an _ orthonormal _ basis . to this end , we define the normalized pauli matrices @xmath132 , which satisfy the _ orthonormality _ condition @xmath133 furthermore , @xmath134 together with @xmath135 forms an orthonormal basis for all hermitian @xmath126 matrices , and we can expand any density matrix in terms of this on basis @xmath136 where @xmath137 for @xmath138 . since @xmath139 , we have @xmath140 for all density matrices . hence , @xmath22 is completely determined by the real @xmath141 vector @xmath142 . this vector is often called the general coherence vector .",
    "equations ( [ eq : bloch ] ) and ( [ eq : coherence ] ) are equivalent , and we easily see that @xmath143 , i.e. , the standard bloch vector differs from the coherence vector only by a factor of @xmath144 .",
    "it is easy to verify that the mapping that takes @xmath22 to the real coherence vector @xmath145 , or equivalently the bloch vector @xmath146 , defines an embedding of the density matrices into a closed ball in @xmath1 for all @xmath147 .",
    "however , the two - level case is special in that the embedding defined is surjective .",
    "we shall now discuss the nature of the resulting differences between the @xmath2 and @xmath111 case , and provide a detailed analysis of the three - level case .      for two - level systems",
    "the embedding defined above is not only one - to - one but also surjective , and hence provides a homeomorphism between orbits of density matrices under @xmath32 and the closed ball of radius one ( bloch vector as defined above ) or radius @xmath148 ( coherence vector as defined above ) in @xmath149 .",
    "unitary transformations of a density matrix can be interpreted as real rotations of the this ball .",
    "example [ ex : one ] shows that the action of the unitary group on the set of quantum states partitions it into an uncountably infinite number of distinct orbit manifolds , homeomorphic to concentric , two - dimensional spheres in the bloch ball , with the exception of the trivial orbit of the completely random ensemble , which is mapped to the single point at the center of the ball .",
    "it is also easy to see that the distance of an orbit from the center of the ball is determined by @xmath150 via @xmath151 ( bloch vector ) or @xmath152 ( coherence vector ) .",
    "pure states ( @xmath153 ) have maximal distance from the center of the ball and hence form its boundary .",
    "furthermore , the disorder of an orbit is completely determined by its distance @xmath154 from the center , i.e. , @xmath155 if @xmath156 .    from the point of view of controllability of quantum systems ,",
    "it is also worth noting that all orbits ( with the exception of the completely random ensemble ) have the same dimension and geometry .",
    "hence , any group that acts transitively on the class of pure states , for instance , will also act transitively on all classes of mixed states and vice versa .",
    "of course , the only such groups are @xmath87 or @xmath157 . hence , pure - state and mixed - state controllability are equivalent notions for two - level systems .      for @xmath111",
    "the situation is quite different due to the fact that the embedding into a closed ball in @xmath158 defined by @xmath159 is not surjective .",
    "it is easy to see that the distance of each unitary orbit from the center in @xmath1 remains completely determined by @xmath150 : @xmath160 however , a glance at the dimensions of the orbits in table [ table : one ] shows immediately that each orbit is only a submanifold of a sphere of a fixed distance from the origin .",
    "for instance , as we have shown in the previous section , the orbit of pure states for @xmath77 corresponds to a four - dimensional submanifold of the seven - dimensional boundary sphere with radius @xmath161 in @xmath162 .",
    "since there is only a single orbit of pure states , the remainder of the points on the boundary sphere do not correspond to physical states .    for mixed states",
    "the situation is more complicated since each sphere of fixed radius @xmath163 from the origin now generally contains an uncountably infinite number of distinct orbits , all satisfying @xmath164 and @xmath165 but differing in higher trace invariants , e.g. , @xmath166 for some @xmath167 .",
    "the dimensions of the orbits contained within each sphere vary depending on the type of ensemble but each sphere ( except for the boundary ) generally contains a set of positive measure of orbits corresponding to physical states , and often a positive - measure set of points that do not belong to physical orbits .",
    "moreover , the degree of disorder of an orbit can no longer be properly characterized by its distance from the center of the ball .",
    "orbits contained in the same sphere can often not be compared with respect to our partial ordering and may have different von - neumann entropy .",
    "furthermore , orbits at different distances from the origin may have the same von - neumann entropy .      to illustrate the general statements above ,",
    "let us consider the @xmath77 case and the set of orbits determined by the family of states @xmath104 with @xmath168 given by @xmath169 note that we have @xmath170 and @xmath171 for all @xmath172 .",

    "in the previous sections we have shown that the action of the unitary group on the set of quantum states endows it with the structure of a stratified set and studied the properties of the strata defined by the unitary orbit manifolds .",
    "this stratification of the set of density matrices was justified on physical grounds since the dynamics of a ( closed ) quantum system is usually determined by the action of the unitary group .    some physical systems , however , exhibit symmetries that restrict the dynamics to a proper subgroup of the unitary group .",
    "for instance , the dynamics of an atomic system comprising two @xmath0-fold degenerate energy levels subject to coherent control fields of various polarizations is governed by the symplectic group @xmath5 due to dynamical symmetries @xcite .",
    "physical systems that exhibit symplectic symmetry are also of special interest in quantum control since they are pure - state controllable but lack mixed - state controllability @xcite .",
    "this means , for instance , that we can steer the system from any pure initial state to any other pure state ; however , if the system is initially in a mixed state , then it may not be possible to steer it to another mixed state even if this state is unitarily equivalent to the initial state , since the set of unitary operations at our disposal is limited and there may not be a sympletic unitary transformation that achieves the desired aim @xcite .",
    "the action of the symplectic group also induces a stratification of the set of density matrices .",
    "since the sympletic group @xmath5 is a subgroup of the unitary group @xmath228 , it naturally follows that the sympletic orbits are smaller than the unitary orbits .",
    "hence , there will be more sympletic orbits .",

    "the stratification induced by the symplectic group is therefore a refinement of the stratification induced by @xmath228 .",
    "the remainder of this section is devoted to exploring the relation between the symplectic and unitary orbits / stratification .",

    "since @xmath56 is a closed subgroup of the lie group @xmath5 , proposition [ prop : b ] implies that the orbit is a homogeneous manifold of real dimension no more than @xmath254 .    for certain special cases we can improve this bound on the orbit dimensions .",

    "see example 1 in @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the action of a lie group on the set of quantum states endows it with the structure of a stratified set with strata given by the orbit manifolds .",
    "in particular , we studied the stratification of the set of states induced by the action of the unitary group , which is especially useful since the unitary orbits are of interest in quantum control and computing , where they determine the maximal set of quantum states that are reachable from a given set via a coherent control or by applying a unitary gate . furthermore , there are many properties of quantum states such as von - neumann or renyi entropy that depend only on the unitary orbit the state belongs to .",
    "it therefore makes sense to define these functions on the unitary stratification .",
    "we have shown that the unitary orbits can be identified with flag manifolds whose type and dimension depend only on the _ multiplicity _ of the eigenvalues of the states belonging to the orbit .",
    "we have also determined the dimensions of the orbit manifolds and shown that we can define a partial ordering related to the degree of disorder in the system on this stratification via majorization .    to better understand the geometry and structure of the set of quantum states , we studied the embedding of the quantum states and their associated orbit manifolds of an @xmath0-level system into real euclidean space provided by the coherence vector .",
    "we showed that the coherence vector we defined always maps the quantum states into a closed ball in @xmath1 in such a manner that the orbit manifolds are mapped to submanifolds of spheres of fixed radius from the center . for @xmath2",
    "this embedding is surjective , hence justifying the identification of the set of quantum states with the closed ball in @xmath149 , and the identification of the orbits with concentric spheres inside this ball . by comparing the dimensions of the orbits we also showed that this embedding is _ no _ longer surjective for @xmath111 and the orbit manifolds in this case are proper submanifolds of spheres in @xmath1 of lower dimension .",
    "the manifold of pure states is always a submanifold of the boundary sphere , which contains no other orbits , while all other spheres of fixed distance from the center generally contain infinitely many disjoint orbits of varying dimensions , and depending on the distance of the sphere from the center , a positive measure set of points which do not correspond to quantum states at all .",
    "a detailed analysis for the three - level case was provided .    finally , we studied systems whose natural evolution is restricted to a subgroup of the unitary group such as the symplectic group due to dynamical symmetries .",
    "we showed that we can define a refined stratification based on the smaller orbits of this subgroup . in case of the symplectic group",
    "we have shown that the orbits of all pseudo - pure states agree with the unitary orbits , while the symplectic orbits of all other ( mixed ) states have lower dimension than the unitary orbits . from the point of view of control",
    "this means that we can control pure and pseudo pure states for such systems but not generic ensembles .",
