    "ever since their discovery @xcite , gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) have been a puzzling mystery , mostly because of their short durations and the apparent lack of counterparts at other wavelengths . a breakthrough in this field came thanks to the italian - dutch satellite _",
    "beppo_sax , which had the capability to localise the bursts prompt emission with a precision of a few arcminutes within a few hours .",
    "this led to the discovery of the afterglow emission at lower energies , initially in x - rays @xcite and subsequently at optical @xcite and radio @xcite wavelengths , which allowed the redshift of these objects to be measured , and firmly established the cosmological nature of grbs .",
    "due to the limited duration and the fading character of the afterglow emission , the prompt distribution of grbs coordinates to the scientific community is a high priority . after the end of the _ beppo_sax mission",
    "this task has been accomplished mainly by _ hete - ii _",
    "@xcite , and _ integral _ through to the integral burst alert system ( ibas ; @xcite ) .",
    "since 2005 , thanks to the _ swift _ satellite @xcite , and to its capability to pinpoint the postions of grbs to a few arcseconds in few minutes , the grb field is progressing quickly .",
    "in particular the association between long grbs and the death of massive ( @xmath220 m@xmath3 ) stars is becoming stronger , and the study of the early x - ray afterglows has shown new flaring phases , which were unknown before _",
    "swift_. in addition , thanks to its good sensitivity , _ swift _ is localising a growing number of grbs at high redshift , the most distant one being 050904 at a redshift of 6.29 @xcite .",
    "although considerable progress in the understanding of grbs has been made in the last years , some crucial points still need some further investigation : the nature of the prompt emission , its relationship to the afterglow , the nature of the central engine , the nature of the progenitor star , in particular in connection to cosmological studies . in order to answer to these questions ,",
    "it is fundmental to collect as much information as possible on every single grb .",
    "the eclairs project is being developed for this scope .",
    "the goal of the eclairs project is conceived to detect during its lifetime at least 200 grbs , of all types , short and long , and in particular the ones with a soft spectrum , potentially the most distant ones @xcite .",
    "the grbs should be observed also before and after the main event , in particular to study the spectrum of a possible precursor .",
    "these grbs should be observed on a broad energy range in order to study the prompt x - ray component , and to constrain as much as possible the bursts  peak energy \" , @xmath4 , namely the energy at which a grb emits the bulk of its energy .",
    "the determination of @xmath4 is very important since in the last years some correlations have been found between this quantity and the isotropic equivalent energy , @xmath5 @xcite , and between @xmath4 and @xmath6 , the collimation corrected energy @xcite .",
    "the scatter around the latter correlation is tight , and suggests to use the grbs as cosmological tools .",
    "indeed ghirlanda & ghisellini [ 2004 ] estimate that a sample of 12 well studied grbs with redshifts between 0.9 and 1.1 are enough to calibrate their correlation , and its application to 150 bursts gives good constraints on the cosmological parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "these constraints are complementary in the ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) plane to the ones obtained from the cosmic microwave background and from the supernovae of type i.    another fundamental aspect of the project is to ensure the possibility of a follow - up from large ground based optical telescopes for at least 75% of the detected bursts .",
    "the observation plan will in fact be adjusted in order to have at least one 8-m - class telecope that covers a large fraction of eclairs field of view .",
    "this is crucial in order to be able to determine the redshift of grbs , and hence their luminosity , in particular , in view of the second generation spectrometers that will be available in 2011 , like x - shooter . in order to allow for the follow up",
    ", eclairs will have to provide a coarse ( 10 arcmin ) localisation within 10 s from the burst onset .",
    "this information can be exploited from ground based robotic telescopes . for half of the grbs",
    "a position with an accuracy of 30 arcsec should be provided within the same time interval . within 1 minute",
    "the best available information should reach all the major telescopes on earth .",
    "the eclairs telescope will be composed by the x and gamma - ray camera ( cxg , the trigger device ) and a soft x - ray camera ( esxc ) , see fig . [",
    "fig : ecl ] .",
    "besides the space borne instruments the mission includes also two dedicated ground follow - up robotic telescopes ( gft ) to study the prompt and early afterglow emission of grbs .",
    "the cxg and esxc will have a wide field of view of @xmath02 sr .",
    "they are both coded mask telescopes and will be operating in th 4300 kev and 110 kev energy range respectively . the cxg will be made of 80@xmath980 pixels of cdte yielding an effective area of 1024 @xmath1 , and will be able to localise all the bursts in its field of view within 10 arcmin ( for a 5@xmath10 source ) .",
    "the esxc camera , triggered by the cxg with its coarse position , will be able to localise the prompt grbs emission , for about half of the burst , within 30 arcsec ( 5 @xmath10 ) .",
    "this instrument will be based on the experience of the soft x - ray camera on board _ hete - ii_. the characteristics of the eclairs instruments are summarised in table [ tab : hien ] .",
    ".characteristics of eclairs instruments [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : hien ]    in the framework of the eclairs project the addition of more instruments is being studied in order to extend the energy band over which the grbs can be studied : as stated earlier , the measurement of @xmath4 is of primary importance .",
    "hence a gamma - ray detector , extending the energy range up to a few mev , is currently being studied .",
    "besides the gft a wide field optical camera could be placed on board in order to study the prompt optical emission .      with the current mission design one",
    "expects that eclairs will localise about 80 grbs per year .",
    "this calculation is based on the instrument geometry , and on a background evaluation made under the hypothesis that between 4 and 50 kev ( the cxg triggering band ) the background is dominated , in absence of strong sources , by the cosmic diffuse x - ray background .",
    "an analytic expression of it can be found in @xcite , and is @xmath11 by numerically integrating eq .",
    "[ extra ] between 4 and 50 kev , multiplying for the detector geometrical area ( a@xmath12=0.4@xmath90.4@xmath980@xmath980 @xmath1 = 1024 @xmath1 ) , and taking the aperture and the average efficiency into account ( the cdte efficiency is practically 100% in this energy range ) , one obtains a background value of 2050 counts s@xmath13 sr@xmath13 . to evaluate the number of grbs in the sky we numerically integrated the peak flux density distribution derived over 1 s with batse @xcite , n(p ) , where n is the number of bursts detected per year and above a given peak flux p. we then took into account the cxg livetime which is mainly limited by the passages above the southern atlantic anomaly and by the time the earth enters the field of view ( see below ) . in the hypothesis of a pure antisolar pointing and an equatorial orbit with an inclination of 30@xmath14 one obtains , on average , that for 64% of the orbit we have a field of view not occulted by the earth .",
    "we will call this factor , @xmath15=0.59 . the triggering energy band of the cxg is different from the batse one ( 50 - 300 kev ) .",
    "so , first of all one has to convert the batse fluxes into cxg fluxes and this has been done by assuming a grb spectrum , described by a band function @xcite , with average parameters ( @xmath4=200 kev , @xmath16=2.25 , @xmath17=1 ) @xcite .",
    "this introduces a multiplicative factor of @xmath18=2.45 on the log n - log p. in addition recent missions like _ beppo_sax , _ hete - ii _ , _ integral _ and",
    "_ swift _ , have shown that there is an entire class of grbs , the so called , x - ray flashes ( xrfs ) , that were too soft to be detected by batse .",
    "so we have to add another multiplicative factor that takes this into account , and its value is @xmath191.55 ( = ( n@xmath20+n@xmath21+n@xmath22)/(n@xmath20+n@xmath21 ) ) , as derived by _ hete - ii _",
    "data @xcite .",
    "the cxg sensitivity limit in the 4 - 50 kev band for a 5 @xmath10 detection in the totally coded field of view is @xmath230.7 ph @xmath24 s@xmath13 , based on the background value derived above and taking into account that a square cm of detector sees a different sky fraction depending on its position on the detector ( a variation between @xmath00.9 and @xmath0 1 sr ) .    by taking the above factors , the variation of the effective area as a function of the off - axis angles of the instrument a@xmath12(@xmath25,@xmath26 ) , the relative sensitivity variation , s@xmath27(@xmath25,@xmath26 , and the variation of the solid angle seen by the detector in each direction of the field of view , @xmath28(@xmath25,@xmath26 ) , into account , one derives the number of grbs per year observable with the cxg in the following way :    @xmath29    with @xmath25 and @xmath26 being the off - axis angles that describe the field of view .",
    "the result is 76 bursts / year .",
    "the positions of the transients detected by the eclairs telescope will be derived on board .",
    "a dedicated real - time processing unit , uts , will be present .",
    "the uts will look for significant excesses in the cxg light curve simultaneously on different time scales , energy bands and detector portions . in case of a positive excess",
    "the imaging process will be invoked and , if a previously uncatalogued source is found , an alert will be generated .",
    "this alert will be transmitted promptly to the ground , so that robotic telescopes can quickly react . at the same time",
    "the infomation will be passed to the esxc in order to refine the position , if possible . at the same time images on different energy bands and timescales",
    "are produced continuously and compared to previously recorded background images in order to spot new transients that could have been missed by the previous algorithms .",
    "the latter , introduced for the first time in the ibas system , is particularly effective in detecting long and  slowly rising \" bursts , like 050904 .",
    "the positions derived on board with eclairs will be distributed to the ground via a vhf network , which will be an extension of the one used today by _ hete - ii_.      the pointing strategy and the orbit of eclairs will be adapted in order to have a large chance of follow - up by the largest ground based telescopes .",
    "the launcher should place eclairs into a circular orbit at 600 km altitude with an inclination of 30@xmath14 . during most of the orbit",
    "the satellite will perform an anti - solar pointing .",
    "in addition the avoidance of regions of bright x - ray sources , in particular sco x-1 , can be accommodated by varying the angle between the orbital plane and the pointing direction .",
    "the eclairs system could be incorporated in a next mission dedicated to grbs . besides grbs",
    ", this mission will include the study of all the transient phenomena in the high - energy sky , such as x - ray bursts , soft gamma - ray repeaters , agns , supernovae , novae , etc .      * the study of the prompt x - ray emission associated to grbs * the detection of a large sample of soft grbs , potentially the most distant ones , thanks to the 450 kev triggering band * the broad band spectra ( from 1 kev to a few mev ) * the prompt ( and/or precursive ) optical emission        7 amati , l. , et al . 2002 , a&a , 390 , 81 band d. , et al .",
