    "although room - temperature spin - related functionality was shown in magnetic tunnel junctions ( mtjs ) with cfs electrodes,@xcite the spin polarization ( @xmath13 ) estimated was not so large ( @xmath14 0.5 ) .",
    "it has so far been argued that the intentional co - fe substitutions between the ( a , c ) and b sites can affect the decrease in @xmath13 of cfs electrodes.@xcite theoretically , electronic band structures were calculated and the effect of the co - fe substitutions on @xmath13 was examined for co - fe based heusler - compound films.@xcite however , there was no experimental work on the influence of the co - fe substitutions on @xmath13 in the cfs films .",
    "recently , in spin light - emitting diodes ( led ) with cfs spin injectors,@xcite highly efficient spin injection into iii - v semiconductors was demonstrated .",
    "the cfs films were grown on ( al , ga)as by using low - temperature molecular beam epitaxy ( lt - mbe ) .",
    "we also demonstrated relatively high performance for cfs electrodes in lateral spin valves ( lsvs),@xcite where the cfs films were grown by lt - mbe and highly @xmath112@xmath12-ordered structures were also evaluated by conversion electron mssbauer spectroscopy ( cems ) measurements.@xcite contrary to the previous works with mtjs,@xcite relatively large @xmath15 0.8 was already obtained at room temperature.@xcite we infer that these results originate from the high - quality epitaxial growth with the precise control of the atomic composition using lt - mbe,@xcite and these growth techniques have already been established for other heusler compounds.@xcite hence , if we tune the substitution of fe for co using our lt - mbe techniques , the control of @xmath13 can be demonstrated experimentally and one can clarify the influence of the co - fe substitutions on @xmath13 in cfs .    in this study",

    "this experimental study gives an important knowledge to obtain high - performance co@xmath0fe@xmath1si heusler - compound electrodes .",
    "prior to the fabrication and characterizations of thin - film samples , we briefly explain the crystal structure of general bulk samples by using fig .",
    "1(a ) . in the ideal @xmath112@xmath16-type cfs",

    ". with increasing fe concentration ( @xmath3 ) from @xmath3 = 1.0 to 3.0 in co@xmath0fe@xmath1si , fe atoms can occupy the a and c sites , leading to the replacement of co atoms .",

    "the @xmath3 value in the films was confirmed by measuring the energy dispersive x - ray spectra .",
    "@xmath22-@xmath23 reflection high energy electron diffraction ( rheed ) patterns of co@xmath0fe@xmath1si layers clearly exhibited symmetrical streaks , showing good two - dimensional epitaxial growth .",

    "for the estimation of the spin polarization at room temperature , the co@xmath0fe@xmath1si films were patterned into the submicron - sized electrodes by using a conventional electron - beam lithography and an ar ion milling technique . in order to form the lsvs , 100-nm - thick cu strips bridging the two co@xmath0fe@xmath1si electrodes",

    ". one of the crystal structures of an ordered fcs is illustrated in the inset of fig .",
    "there are two types of magnetically distinct fe sites , i.e. , fe(i ) , occupying a or c site coordinated with four fe atoms and four si atoms , and fe(ii ) , occupying the b site surrounded by eight fe or co atoms . in a previous work of bulk co@xmath0fe@xmath1si samples reported by jung _",
    "et al_.,@xcite the two sites with two different hyperfine magnetic fields were completely distinguished by the @xmath24fe mssbauer spectroscopy .",
    "thus , we can probe the local structures of the fcs film by detecting the two different surroundings of fe atoms .",
    "the @xmath24fe mssbauer spectroscopy for the fcs epilayer grown is presented in fig .",
    "an evident sextet pattern , typical for magnetically ordered systems , is obtained ( black solid circles ) .",
    "the spectrum can be successfully fitted with five magnetic environments defined as site number @xmath27 from 1 to 5 , where the five fitting curves are also presented in fig .",
    "note that the quadrupole shift was fixed to zero due to the cubic symmetry of the local fe environment and the intensity ratio of the magnetically split sextet was also fixed to 3@xmath284@xmath281@xmath281@xmath284@xmath283 , since the magnetic moment was along the film plane , reflecting the magnetic shape anisotropy .",
    "the large two contributions , denoted by the site 1 and 2 with hyperfine magnetic fields of 19.4 and 32.8 t , respectively , are the same as the two sites , fe(i ) and fe(ii ) , in the bulk samples in ref.@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the other three subspectra with smaller intensity can be recognized as disordered sites .",

    "if we obtain the perfectly substituted structure in fcs ( @xmath3 = 2.0 ) , there are fe(i ) and fe(ii ) sites evenly , i.e. , site 1 @xmath28 site 2 @xmath32 50 ( % ) @xmath28 50 ( % ) . in actual our fcs epilayer , site 1 @xmath28 site 2 @xmath32 37.3 ( % ) @xmath28 36.6 ( % ) , indicating that the local degree of the structural ordering exceeds 70 % even for the low - temperature grown fcs film .",
    "we note that the ratio of site 1 to site 2 is nearly one to one .",
    "since the hyperfine magnetic fields for the site 3 and site 4 were 30.5 t and 25.1 t , respectively , the site 3 and 4 might be very similar to fe(ii ) and fe(i ) , respectively .",
    "such deviations of the hyperfine magnetic fields from the ideal values can be caused by the site occupation of surplus fe and si atoms with ( a , c ) sites.@xcite in other words , although the presence of about 15 % sites ( sites 3 and 4 ) was also arising from the fe(i)- and fe(ii)-like structures , local off - stoichiometry led to such disordered structures .",
    "finally , the site 5 with less than 15 % was regarded as the almost nonmagnetic site with a small hyperfine magnetic field of less than 5 t , which may originate from the fcs / ge interface.@xcite    in our previous works for fs ( @xmath26 3),@xcite we have obtained relatively high local degree of the structural ordering ( @xmath20 70 % ) for fs ( @xmath26 3 ) .",
    "also , we have confirmed that the local degree of the structural ordering exceeds 70 % is achieved and the ratio of site 1 to site 2 is nearly one to one in fig .",
    "even if we conduct the change in @xmath3 in lt - mbe conditions , we can achieve the atomic substitutions without decreasing the structural ordering in the heusler - compound structure .",
    "considering the fact that there was no site occupation of fe atoms with d sites for cfs ( @xmath26 1),@xcite we can eventually judge that the fe atoms are substituted for the co ones occupying with a and c sites , following the site preference selectivity described for a bulk co@xmath0fe@xmath1si system.@xcite    taking these structural characterizations into account , we further examined magnetic properties with increasing @xmath3 in co@xmath0fe@xmath1si films grown on si(111 ) and/or ge(111 ) .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "3 shows representative field - dependent magnetization ( @xmath33 ) curve at 300 k for the fcs film , where the applied field direction is parallel to the magnetic easy axis in the film plane .",
    "a clear ferromagnetic hysteretic curve is observed and the coercive force is very small with a value of @xmath209 oe , which is consistent with typical characteristics of heusler compounds.@xcite the estimated saturation magnetization ( @xmath30@xmath29 ) reaches more than @xmath2080 % of bulk @xmath30@xmath29.@xcite these features were seen for all the co@xmath0fe@xmath1si films ( 1.0 @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath2 3.0 ) , implying that the crystal quality of the co@xmath0fe@xmath1si films are very good .",
    "then , we summarize @xmath30@xmath29 versus @xmath3 for the co@xmath0fe@xmath1si films in the main panel of fig .",
    "3 , where @xmath30@xmath29 values of the co@xmath0fe@xmath1si films grown on si and ge are plotted . we can find that @xmath30@xmath29 is monotonically tuned with varying @xmath3 .",
    "this tendency is in good agreement with that of bulk samples in a previous work,@xcite in which this behavior in @xmath30@xmath29 versus @xmath3 can be explained by the change in the local magnetic moment of fe atoms due to the substitution of fe for co occupying a and c sites.@xcite therefore , we conclude that the obtained monotonic change in @xmath30@xmath29 versus @xmath3 results from the experimentally verified atomic substitution in co@xmath0fe@xmath1si films ( 1.0 @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath2 3.0 ) .",
    "also , the electronic structures are determined predominantly by the chemical surroundings of magnetic atoms such as the number and type of the nearest neighbors at given site.@xcite since the magnetic properties in co@xmath0fe@xmath1si films on si or ge were controlled by the co - fe atomic substitution , the control of @xmath13 can also be expected because of the systematic change in the dos at the fermi level.@xcite to confirm this effect , we finally evaluated the room - temperature @xmath13 for co@xmath0fe@xmath1si films by using nlsv measurements and the analysis based on the one - dimensional spin diffusion model.@xcite since we have so far evaluated cfs ( @xmath26 1.0 ) and fs ( @xmath26 3.0),@xcite we hereafter focus on fe@xmath34co@xmath34si ( @xmath26 1.5 ) and fcs ( @xmath26 2.0 ) . a scanning electron micrograph ( sem ) of a representative fcs / cu lsv",

    "shows a nonlocal magnetresistance curve of a fcs / cu lsv , measured at room temperature .",
    "we observe clear nlsv signal depending on the magnetization configuration between the spin injector and detector .",
    "it should be noted that a relatively large spin signal ( @xmath36 ) of @xmath201.3 m@xmath37 is seen , which is roughly five times larger than that for py / cu lsvs of the same size and low - resistance ohmic interfaces.@xcite    cosi / cu lsv .",

    "the @xmath41@xmath40 values used are 5 @xmath42 1 nm ( @xmath26 3.0 ) , 4 @xmath42 1 nm ( @xmath26 2.0 and 1.5 ) , and 3 @xmath42 1 nm ( @xmath26 1.0).,width=321 ]    in our previous works,@xcite we simplified the spin signals on the basis of a one - dimensional spin diffusion model:@xcite @xmath43 where @xmath38 , @xmath44 , @xmath39@xmath40 , and @xmath41@xmath40 are the bulk spin polarization , interface spin polarization , resistivity , and spin diffusion length of the ferromagnetic electrode , respectively . @xmath39@xmath45 and @xmath41@xmath45 are those for the nonmagnetic wire , and @xmath35 is the separation distance between the injector and detector ( @xmath46 400 nm ) .",
    "we determined @xmath39@xmath40 by the four - terminal resistance measurements . also , we know that @xmath39@xmath45 and @xmath41@xmath45 are 2.5 @xmath47@xmath37 cm and 500 nm , respectively.@xcite @xmath48@xmath49 is the resistance of the interface between the ferromagnet and nonmagnet , but this term can be ignored since we have already confirmed that @xmath50 @xmath51 0.1 f@xmath37m@xmath52 .",
    "note that the area parameter @xmath53 is defined as ( @xmath54@xmath55/@xmath56 ) , where @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 are the areas of the junctions in the spin injector and spin detector , and the cross section of the nonmagnetic strip , respectively as described in our previous works.@xcite the @xmath53 values for the co@xmath0fe@xmath1si / cu junctions were directly measured by sem observations .",

    "there is an almost monotonic change in the magnitude of @xmath13@xmath40 with varying @xmath39@xmath40 , which implies that the structural ordering crucially affects the @xmath38 values for co@xmath0fe@xmath1si films , consistent with general interpretations in heusler compounds.@xcite    we note that the magnitude of @xmath13@xmath40 values for the co@xmath0fe@xmath1si / cu lsvs are also changed monotonically with varying @xmath3 .",
    "since the resistivity shown in horizontal axis depended on the microscopic structural ordering in the heusler wires , the scattering of the horizontal axis could not be avoided.@xcite also , the sign of @xmath13@xmath40 depending on the structural ordering should be considered.@xcite however , fig .",
    "4(c ) apparently reveals that the room - temperature @xmath13@xmath40 can be tuned by systematically introducing co - fe substitution in co@xmath0fe@xmath1si films even on group - iv semiconductor platforms .",

    "<S> using low - temperature molecular beam epitaxy , we study substitutions of fe atoms for co ones in co@xmath0fe@xmath1si ( 1.0 @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath2 3.0 ) heusler - compound films grown on si and ge . even for the low - temperature grown heusler - compound films , the co - fe atomic substitution at a and c sites can be confirmed by the conversion electron mssbauer spectroscopy measurements . as a result , the magnetic moment and room - temperature spin polarization estimated by nonlocal spin - valve measurements are systematically changed with the co - fe substitutions . </S>",
    "<S> this study experimentally verified that the co - fe substitution in co@xmath0fe@xmath1si heusler compounds can directly affect the room - temperature spin polarization . </S>"
