    "the investigation of relativistic quantum information not only supplies the gap of interdiscipline refer to quantum information and relativity theory , but also has a positive promotion on the development of them . as a result of that , this domain has been paid much attention in the last decade @xcite . among them , most papers have focused on quantum resource , e. g. , quantum entanglement@xcite and discord @xcite , because quantum resource plays an very important role in the quantum information tasks such as teleportation @xcite and computation @xcite , and studying it in a relativistic setting is very closely related to the implementation of quantum tasks with observers in arbitrary relative motion .",
    "in addition , extending this work to the black hole background is very helpful for us to understand the entropy and paradox @xcite of the black hole .",
    "despite much effort has been paid to extend quantum information theory to the relativistic setting , another important foundation of quantum mechanics ",
    "nonlocality is barely considered .",
    "recently , nicolai friis @xmath4 firstly studied the nonlocality in the noninertial frame , and they pointed out that residual entanglement of accelerated fermions is not nonlocal @xcite . following them",
    "alexander smith @xmath4 studied the tripartite nonlocality in the noninertial frames @xcite , and daekil park considered tripartite entanglement - dependence of tripartite nonlocality @xcite .",
    "generally , most researchers analyzed the quantum nonlocality by means of bell s inequalities @xcite for bipartite system and svetlichny inequality for tripartite system @xcite , respectively . because , these inequalities are satisfied by any local hidden variable theory , but they may be violated by quantum mechanics . however , shunlong luo and shuangshuang fu have introduced a new way to quantify nonlocality by measurement , which is called the min @xcite , and following their paper , a number of papers emerged to perfect its definition @xcite and discussed its properties @xcite . in addition , some authors have analyzed its dynamical behavior and compared it with other quantum correlation measurements such as the geometric discord @xcite .",
    "however , all of these studies do nt involve the effect on the min resulting from relativistic effect .",
    "in fact , the study that how the unruh effect @xcite affects the min not only is very significant to theory study , but also plays a key role in practice , which can help us to implement the quantum task preferably and more efficiently .",
    "inspired by that , we analyze how the unruh effect and prepared states affect the min in this paper and we will show some new properties .",
    "our paper is constructed as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the different vacuums for relativistic observers and the definition of the min . in section iii",
    "how the unruh effect and prepared states affect the min are studied . and in the last section we summarize and discuss our conclusions .",
    "it is well known that an uniformly accelerated observer will detect a thermal particle distribution in the minkowski vacuum .",
    "the minkowski vacuum can be factorized as a product of the vacua of all different unruh modes @xmath5 , from the noninertial observers perspective , can be expressed as @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 @xmath8 denote rindler mode in region @xmath1 ( region @xmath2 ) , and @xmath9 is the unruh temperature in which @xmath10 denotes the proper acceleration of the noninertial observer .",
    "likewise , the particle state of unruh mode @xmath11 in the rindler basis is found to be latexmath:[\\ ] ] which is the same as @xmath114 .",
    "in addition , as @xmath115 the min vanishes , which means that the correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath2 is local when the observers are inertial .     as a function of unruh temperature @xmath61 .",
    "we take parameters @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 for red dashed line ; @xmath65,@xmath116 and @xmath67 for blue solid line .",
    "the insert shows the detail of sudden change.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    when @xmath117 , by taking fixed @xmath70 , we plot @xmath68 as a function of @xmath53 in fig .",
    "we learn from the figure that , unlike the fig.[tsc ] , @xmath68 increases monotonously with the increase of @xmath53 .",
    "that is to say , the bigger @xmath53 is , the sudden change behavior occurs latter . and when @xmath118 , it is also important to note that as @xmath78 increases @xmath68 increases monotonously too .     as a function of @xmath53 , here",
    "we take @xmath69 and @xmath72.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    how the prepared states affect the min for case ( i ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ minc1 ] , which tells us that @xmath112 increases monotonously as @xmath73 ( @xmath119 ) increases .",
    "and for the case that @xmath52 , the min is independent of @xmath75 but dependent of @xmath77 , @xmath78 before @xmath68 , while after @xmath68 it depends on @xmath75 and @xmath76",
    ". however , no matter which case , the min increases with the increase of @xmath73 .     as function of @xmath53 and @xmath54 with @xmath50 .",
    "here we take fixed @xmath120 from top to bottom , respectively.,scaledwidth=55.0% ]    from the above discussions , we know that the unruh effect can induce the degradation for @xmath56 , but the increase for @xmath112 .",
    "however , @xmath121 has different dynamics for different classes of states : ( i ) when @xmath50 , @xmath121 is independent of the unruh temperature .",
    "that is to say , @xmath121 is a constant versus the unruh temperature for this class of states ; ( ii ) when @xmath74 , with the increase of the unruh temperature @xmath121 decreases monotonously until @xmath122 and from then on it remains constant ; and ( iii ) when @xmath123 , @xmath121 decays quickly until @xmath124 and after that it decays relatively slowly .",
    "we plot these dynamical behaviors in fig .",
    "[ sumn ] .     and @xmath112 as a function of the unruh temperature .",
    "we take @xmath125 and @xmath64 for the red dashed line ; @xmath126 and @xmath66 for the blue solid line , and @xmath126 and @xmath127 for the yellow solid line.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "the effect of the prepared states and unruh temperature on the min of dirac fields was investigated and the following new properties were found : ( i ) the min @xmath56 for the x - type states decreases as the unruh temperature increases , but @xmath112 increases with the increase of the unruh temperature .",
    "( ii ) for fixed unruh temperature , it is found that the min always increases as @xmath73 @xmath128 increases , and it takes the maximal value for the bell basis states .",
    "( iii ) both @xmath56 and @xmath112 have a peculiar dynamics with a sudden change at @xmath68 provided @xmath3 appropriately chosen , the @xmath68 for @xmath56 decreases as @xmath3 increases , while it is contrary for @xmath112 .",
    "( iv ) the min is more general than the quantum nonlocality related to violation of bell s inequalities .",
    "besides , it increases as the geometric discord increases , and it is always equal or larger than the geometric discord . and ( v ) @xmath121 has three kinds of dynamics : ( a ) when @xmath50 , it is independent of the unruh temperature ; ( b ) when @xmath74 , with the increase of the unruh temperature it decreases monotonously until @xmath129 , and from then on it remains constant ; and ( c ) when @xmath123 , with the increase of the unruh temperature , it decays quickly until @xmath130 , and after that it decays relatively slowly .",
    "here we just simply discuss the relation between the min and the maximal expectation values of chsh inequality and geometric discord .",
    "more detailed study of this relation can help us to ont only understand the min more clearly , but also distinguish difference of quantum resource based on different correlation measurements .",
    "such topics are left for future research .",
