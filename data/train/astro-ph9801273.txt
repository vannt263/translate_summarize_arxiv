    "the binary nature of these stars accounts for the observed chemical peculiarities through mass transfer across the binary system ( mcclure et al .",
    "1980 ; mcclure 1983 ) .",
    "the exact mass - transfer mode is still a matter of debate but is turning towards a solution involving roche - lobe overflow or wind accretion , depending on the orbital period ( han et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "contrarily to tc - rich s  stars which are able to synthesize heavy elements on their own , tc - poor s stars are believed to be the cool descendants of barium stars and thus also owe their chemical peculiarities to binarity ( jorissen & mayor 1992 ; ake 1997 ; van  eck et al .",

    "[ fig5]a ) , out of which a meaningful radial velocity is very difficult to extract . in other cases like aa  cyg and r  hya , the cc - dips are featureless , broad and very stable , and these stars have the smallest jitter in our sample of mira s stars ( table 3d of jorissen et al .",
    "1998 ) . for stars like r  and (=  1967 ) and rz  peg (=  209890 ) , two clearly distinct dips are present . in rz peg for example ( figs .",
    "[ fig5]c - d ) , the two dips correspond to velocities of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , whereas the center of mass of the star ( as probed by submm observations of the circumstellar co rotational lines ) moves with a velocity of @xmath9  ( sahai & liechti 1995 ) , close to the average of the two  dips .",
    "the two minima observed in the cc - dip are therefore likely associated with upwards- and downwards - moving layers forming a shock in the mira atmosphere ( e.g. fox et al .",
    "1984 , querci 1986 , bowen 1988 , bessell et al . 1996 ) .",

    "pseudo-_orbital solution of period 337.3@xmath12d , whereas the gcvs lists @xmath13d for the associated mira variations .",
    "it is interesting to note that the radial - velocity variations of r  cmi are strongly non - sinusoidal in spite of the almost symmetric light curve ( the rise time from minimum to maximum light represents 48% of the total cycle , according to the gcvs , compared to 44% for rz peg ) . for ss",
    "vir , the radial - velocity and photometric periods are 361.2@xmath14d and @xmath15d , respectively",

    ", is quite obvious .",
    "the radial velocities corresponding to each of the peaks have been extracted by fitting a double - gaussian function to the profile .",
    "the resulting velocity curve as a function of the phase is displayed in fig .",
    "two conclusions may be drawn from this figure : ( i ) each peak has a rather constant velocity , with the center - of - mass velocity corresponding almost to the average of the two peaks , and ( ii ) the double dip occurs around velocity phases @xmath16  0.9 , and this behaviour repeats from one cycle to the other . the velocity difference between the two peaks is of the order of 20  30  .    the light curve of rz  peg has been kindly provided to us by the aavso ( mattei 1997 ) , and makes it possible to convert velocity phases into photometric phases .",
    "the photometric period appears reasonably stable over the time span covered by the radial - velocity observations , with an average period of 437.8d , very close to the 437.3d period of the velocity variations . adopting a period of 437.3d ,",
    "the relation @xmath17 is derived from the aavso maximum ( hjd 2448301 ) closest to the zero point of the radial - velocity phase ( hjd 2448413 ) . from this relation",
    ", it may be concluded that _ the double cc - dip occurs just after maximum light _ ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "a similar phenomenon of line doubling near maximum light has been reported in several other mira stars . in the mira s star @xmath6  cyg , hinkle et al .",
    "( 1982 ) reported such a line doubling for the rotation - vibration second overtone ( @xmath19 ) infrared co lines and high - excitation first overtone ( @xmath20 ) co lines .",
    "maehara ( 1971 ) also reported the doubling of cn and atomic lines near 800.0 nm around maximum light in @xmath6  cyg , and gillet et al .",
    "( 1985 ) in s car .",
    "this line - doubling phenomenon is the signature of a shock front propagating through the line - forming region ( e.g. gillet et al .",
    "1985 , bessell et al . 1996 )",
    ". incidentally , in @xmath6  cyg ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) , a line - doubling as clear as in rz  peg is _ not _ observed for the blue - violet iron lines sampled by ( baranne et al . 1979 ) .",
    "the  radial velocities of @xmath6  cyg ( averaging to + 3.2  ; table  3d of jorissen et al .",
    "1998 ) , derived from the clean cc - dips ( fig .",
    "5b ) , agree with the value obtained by pierce et al .",
    "hinkle et al . ( 1982 ; their fig .",
    "15 ) argue that these blue - violet photospheric absorption lines with a constant radial velocity form in the infalling material for the whole pulsation cycle .",
    "nevertheless , the  profile of @xmath6  cyg exhibits some characteristic features that may be related to the shock front propagating through the photosphere . near visual phases",
    "0.00.2 , the  profile of @xmath6  cyg has a typical inverse _",
    "p - cygni _ shape ( fig .",
    "5a ) with the blue - shifted ` emission ' component peaking at @xmath21  .",
    "this velocity corresponds to that of the outflowing material , as derived from the second overtone co rotation - vibration lines by hinkle et al .",
    "a similar inverse p - cygni profile has been reported by ferlet & gillet ( 1984 ) for the tii lines near 1 @xmath22 m in mira near maximum light .",
    "it is very likely that the same physical phenomenon  namely a shock front propagating through the line - forming region  is responsible for the time - dependent features observed in the  cc - dips of rz  peg and @xmath6  cyg .",
    "this conclusion is suggested by the fact that in both stars , the line - doubling occurs near maximum light , and the offset between the two distinct components of the cc - dip is of the same order ( 20 to 30  , corresponding to the shock discontinuity ) .",
    "these observed features are well reproduced by the synthetic fei and co line profiles computed by bessell et al .",
    "( 1996 ) in a dynamical mira atmosphere with a propagating shock .",
    "for some reason however , the atmospheric structures of rz  peg and @xmath6  cyg must be different , so that only in rz  peg are the blue - violet iron lines sampled by  forming in absorption on both sides of the shock , resulting in a clean double - minima cc - dip .      because they are difficult to observe at minimum light , mira s and c stars",
    "were generally insufficiently sampled to attempt a period search on their radial - velocity curve .",
    "well - sampled curves are , however , available for the mira s stars aa  cyg , @xmath6  cyg , r  hya , for the c ( no tc ) stars ss  vir and s  uma , and for all the sc stars .",
    "some of these stars have already been discussed in sects .",
    "[ sect : intrinsic ] and [ sect : rzpeg ] .",
    "no satisfactory periods emerge for aa cyg and r  hya .",
    "the radial velocity of the absorption lines in @xmath6  cyg is constant , as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sect : rzpeg ] .",
    "the mira s star s  uma (=  110813 ) is perhaps a binary , since the radial - velocity period @xmath23d ( table  [ tab8 ] ) is well distinct from the 225.9d period of the mira variations .",
    "more measurements are needed , however , before that orbital solution may definitely be accepted .",
    "a possible orbital solution , with @xmath24d and @xmath25 , has been found for the sc star  @xmath26 ( table  [ tab8 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "a light curve for this star is provided by jorissen et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , who find photometric variations on a time scale of about 59d .",
    "the absence of coincidence between the radial - velocity and photometric ( quasi-)periods may lend some credit to the orbital nature of the radial - velocity variations observed for  @xmath26 .",
    "we do not accept this interpretation , however , without the following word of caution : another sc star , gp  ori ( = 286340 ) , exhibits radial - velocity variations of a nature very similar to those of  @xmath26 ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ; note especially the drift observed in the early phase of the monitoring , reminiscent of that observed for  @xmath26 ) , but no orbital solution could be obtained for gp  ori . at this point",
    ", we can not exclude the possibility that the ` orbital ' solution found for  @xmath26 is simply a consequence of a favourable time sampling of irregular , intrinsic variations .",
    "one should note in that respect that the @xmath27 ratio observed for  @xmath26 fits well the predictions of a simple linear model of adiabatic acoustic oscillations ( jorissen et al .",
    "finally , the orbital parameters of  @xmath26 would locate that star in a unusual region of the @xmath28 diagram ( fig .  4 of jorissen et al .",
    "1998 ) , which is another argument against that orbital solution .",
    "in fact , relatively large - amplitude radial - velocity variations ( @xmath29 of a few ; table 3e of jorissen et al . 1998 ) are a common feature among sc stars .",
    "for the two mira sc stars in our sample ( r  cmi and rz  peg ) , periodic radial - velocity variations were found with the same period as the light curve ( sect .",
    "[ sect : intrinsic ] ) . for the remaining sc stars , which are of semiregular ( sr ) or irregular ( l ) variability types , very irregular radial - velocity variations",
    "are indeed observed , with the possible exception of  @xmath26 discussed above .",
    "when the number of measurements is relatively small ( @xmath30 ) and covers a limited time span , these variations may mimick orbital variations ."
