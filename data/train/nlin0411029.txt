    "with the substantial progress realized in the field of pattern formation over the last @xmath6 years has come an increased need to make stricter comparisons between experiments and their theoretical descriptions @xcite .",
    "it has become increasingly important for first principles theories and numerical models to closely mirror experimental systems in order to make unambiguous comparisons .",
    "a broad range of phenomena is exhibited by laboratory pattern - forming systems , for example , stationary and traveling patterns , spiral defect chaos , localized structures , and so on . an experimental system is typically specified by several dimensionless control parameters which span regions where different patterns are observed .",
    "these regions are bounded by lines or planes in parameter space .",
    "codimension - two ( cod2 ) points occur at special values of the control parameters , and are the nonequilibrium analogs of multicritical points . near such points ,",
    "especially interesting and complex pattern interactions may be expected @xcite .",
    "one of the most successful approaches used to study patterns is the landau amplitude equation for pattern amplitudes near a bifurcation .",
    "since the equation can be deduced from symmetry , it has found broad applicability in several experimental systems including rayleigh - bnard convection ( rbc ) , taylor vortex flow ( tvf ) , and electrohydrodynamic convection in nematic liquid crystals ( ehc ) @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we apply the landau amplitude formalism to thin film electroconvection in an annular geometry , a system that has previously been studied both experimentally@xcite and theoretically at the linear stability level@xcite .",
    "this system has a rich bifurcation behavior , with numerous cod2 points@xcite .",
    "the landau amplitude equation can be rigorously derived from the complete set of underlying dynamical equations by perturbative expansions about the bifurcation point .",
    "very different physical systems with a common symmetry - breaking bifurcation have , up to parameter - dependent coefficients , identical amplitude equations .",
    "whereas this universal description has been tremendously successful in describing the pattern near the bifurcation , its quantitative verification relies heavily on comparing absolutely the parameter - dependencies of the measured and calculated coefficients .",
    "this strategy has seldom been executed and to our knowledge only in rbc , tvf , and ehc has it been generally successful @xcite . whereas these systems are three - dimensional ( 3d ) , electroconvection in an annular fluid film , the system discussed here , is two - dimensional ( 2d ) .",
    "rbc , tvf , and to a lesser extent ehc , in large part owe their spatio - temporal richness to the extra spatial dimension . the comparatively simpler spatio - temporal structure of 2d thin film electroconvection is accentuated by its special geometry .",
    "the annular film results in a naturally periodic experimental system .",
    "this azimuthal periodicity , and thus the absence of lateral boundaries , simplifies the theoretical treatment and invites interesting experimental scenarios such as interposing convection with shear in a closed channel @xcite .",

    "the action of the gravitational field on the mass density exerts a force on the fluid . in both cases",
    "when the forcing overcomes dissipation , the fluid becomes linearly unstable to perturbations , resulting in convection .",
    "the relationship between the electric potential and the surface charge density at any spatial position on the film is nonlocal in electroconvection , unlike thermal convection where the temperature and mass density are locally related .",
