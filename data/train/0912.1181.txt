    "a promising way of building feasible quantum computer is the control of quantum superpositions in coupled quantum dots ( qds ) called quantum dot molecules ( qdms ) @xcite . in particular , the two electron ground states are used as the logical qubit states and can be manipulated by electrical @xcite as well as by optical means @xcite .",
    "however , the coherent control of the qubit states is limited not only by the electron - electron interaction @xcite but also by the coupling to the semiconductor host materials resulting in emission and absorption of phonons @xcite .",
    "since the energy difference between the two electron ground states is of order of a few mev , this can lead to new phonon - mediated relaxation processes @xcite .",
    "the electron transfer between the qds is of great importance for the currently performed optical and transport experiments @xcite , but only little theoretical work exists on the influence of the phonon coupling .",
    "it was mostly limited to perturbative and markovian theory or by including only diagonal electron - phonon interaction @xcite . a comprehensive theory including non - markovian processes and non - diagonal coupling to the phonon reservoir is required to adequately describe this important solid state qubit system .    in this paper",
    ", we present a fully quantum kinetic description of the phonon - mediated relaxation in doped quantum dot molecules including non - markovian effects . we show that the phonon - electron interaction in coupled quantum dots leads to a fast electron relaxation on a picosecond timescale and strongly affects the coherent electron evolution . a non - perturbative theory based on correlation expansion technique @xcite including up to three particle correlations",
    "is used , which describes up to two - phonon assisted processes .",
    "we include both diagonal and off - diagonal electron - phonon couplings and show that the usually neglected off - diagonal contribution can play a dominant role in relaxation processes leading to fast phonon - assisted electron tunneling .",
    "we derive a compact expression for the electron occupation and coherence evolution in the markovian approximation and compare the results with the full quantum kinetic description .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , a quantum kinetic model describing an electron confined in a quantum dot molecule coupled to the phonon environment is introduced .",
    "next , sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] contains the results on phonon - assisted electron evolution and the comparison between non - markovian and markovian regime . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , we conclude the paper with final remarks . in addition , some technical details on the correlation expansion technique are presented in the appendix .",
    "the system under study consists of a singly doped quantum dot molecule build from two quantum dots .",
    "we consider the relaxation between the two energetically lowest states of the electron @xmath0 in the left and @xmath1 in the right quantum dot .",
    "the free electron hamiltonian reads @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the tunneling coupling between the qds and @xmath4 is the energy difference between the ground states in both quantum dots .",
    "the free phonon hamiltonian reads @xmath5 with phonon creation and annihilation operators @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively , phonon frequencies @xmath8 and phonon wave vector @xmath9 , where @xmath10 labels different phonon branches ( longitudinal @xmath11 and two transversal @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) .",

    "note , that we take into account the usually neglected off - diagonal electron - phonon coupling , describing the direct phonon - mediated electron transfer between the quantum dots with simultaneous emission or absorption of a phonon , which , as we will show , leads to a fast relaxation channel .",
    "we consider the relevant acoustic phonons coupled via both piezoelectric coupling and deformation potential with corresponding coupling elements : @xmath16 @xmath17 with gaussian electron wave functions @xmath18 in the numerical simulations , the parameters corresponding to self - assembled gaas quantum dots have been used : @xmath19  nm , @xmath20  nm , and @xmath21  nm , where @xmath22 is the electron wave function size of the @xmath23-th qd , and the distance between the dots is  @xmath24 . here ,",

    "the function @xmath35 in the piezoelectric coupling element depends only on the orientation of the phonon wave vector and for a zinc - blende structure reads : @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 \\sin(2\\varphi)$ ] .    in order to study the dynamics of the electron confined in a quantum dot molecule in the presence of electron - phonon interaction , a second order correlation expansion method",
    "is used @xcite .",
    "this is a non - perturbative technique which can be employed for the microscopic quantum kinetic description of the dynamics covering the non - markovian memory effects ( see appendix for details ) .",
    "the equations of motion for the electron occupations @xmath39 , @xmath40 , coherences @xmath41 , and the phonon - assisted elements e.g. @xmath42 are derived and solved by standard numerical methods .",
    "we included up to three particle correlations , e.g. @xmath43 , which leads to a description of up to two - phonon assisted processes .",
    "an alternative approach to study the phonon - assisted dynamics is the real time renormalization - group method @xcite .",
    "the electron is initially in a quantum dot with higher energy , @xmath44 .",
    "we assume that the injection time is much shorter than the phonon reservoir response , so that all the correlation terms can be initially set to zero . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1-temp ] , the occupation of the qd with higher energy with and without coupling to the phonon reservoir at four different temperatures is shown as a function of time . as expected ,",
    "the ideal electron evolution without interaction with phonons ( solid black line ) is a coherent oscillation of the electron between the two quantum dots with period determined by the tunneling coupling and the energy difference between the two electron states @xmath45 and is proportional to @xmath46 .",
    "for the presented set of parameters with @xmath47  mev and @xmath48  mev , the electron oscillates slightly but mostly stays in the qd with higher energy .",
    "the tunneling coupling is to small to let the electron fully tunnel between the dots .    if the coupling to the phonon environment is included , the dynamics of the confined electron changes completely : the electron tunnels to the neighboring dot already on the picosecond time scale . at low temperature , the electron tunnels from the quantum dot with the higher energy to the one with the lower energy . at @xmath49  k ,",
    "only the emission processes are available , thus , the electron tunnels completely to the lower qd . as the temperature grows , the probability of the phonon absorption increases . in consequence , the final state of the electron moves from the quantum dot with the lower energy towards an equal superposition of electron confined in the left @xmath0 and right @xmath1 quantum dot .",
    "this is due to the fact , that at high temperatures , the probability of phonon absorption equals to the probability of its emission .",
    "in addition , the amplitude of the oscillations decreases with growing temperature , since the damping gets stronger .",
    "similarly , the initial decay is also faster at higher temperature .",
    "we compared the results including up to two - phonon assisted processes to those with up to one phonon and found out that the former leads only to a small correction .",
    "thus , the quantum kinetic description with the first order correlation expansion technique results in the proper description of the electron dynamics .    in order to show that the fast relaxation processes result from the direct phonon - assisted electron tunneling described by the off - diagonal electron coupling to phonons , the occupation of a qd modeled using only the diagonal interaction hamiltonian is shown in the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : m - temp ] .",
    "one can see , that in this case the relaxation is considerably slower up to two orders of magnitude .",
    "thus , in order to properly describe the dynamics of an electron in a quantum dot molecule , one can not neglect the off - diagonal electron - phonon coupling .",
    "a similar conclusion has been met by zibik et al .",
    "@xcite , who studied the coherence of the @xmath10-@xmath50 transition in single quantum dots .",
    "it has been shown that both direct absorption of acoustical phonons between the two @xmath50 states as well as the scattering via virtual transitions have to be included in order to explain the decoherence mechanisms of the considered transition .",
    "next , for comparison with our full quantum kinetic description , we have derived a markovian approximation for the electron dynamics governed by real electron transitions , where the memory effects are neglected . including phonon - assisted correlations up to the first order , it is possible to derive compact expressions for the electron density and coherence [ see eqs .",
    "( [ f ] ) and  ( [ p ] ) , respectively ] .    the first term in the equation of motion for the density @xmath51 describes the ideal coherent evolution of the electron , whereas the second term corresponds to the correction due to the electron - phonon coupling . here",
    ", one can easily recognize the two terms corresponding to the phonon emission @xmath52 and absorption @xmath53 processes , where @xmath54 is the bose distribution function .",
    "the occupation is directly affected only by the off - diagonal coupling to phonon reservoir .",
    "in contrast to this , the polarization contains also the diagonal elements which lead to pure dephasing processes @xcite .",
    "they are particularly visible in the case of quantum dots with large size difference .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the considered phonon - induced decay is a few orders of magnitude faster than the radiative decay of an exciton confined in a single quantum dot , which for self - assembled gaas qds is in the order of 1  ns @xcite .",
    "the results of the numerical simulations for the markovian approximation are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : m - temp ] . here , the coherent oscillations of the electron vanish due to strong diagonal and off - diagonal damping elements .",
    "thus , the difference between the quantum kinetic description and markovian approximation are particularly visible in the case of lower temperatures , where the amplitude of the oscillations is large in the full description .",
    "as mentioned previously , the tunneling coupling and energy difference determine the period and amplitude of the coherent oscillations between the two electron states in both quantum dots . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1-eps ] , the time evolution of the qd occupation including the coupling to phonons is shown for different values of the energy difference @xmath45 . the energy difference strongly influences the phonon - mediated relaxation , since the probability of the phonon - assisted processes is high for @xmath55 a few of mev @xcite .",
    "thus the electron tunneling is very fast for @xmath45 from @xmath56 to @xmath57  mev .",
    "if the energy difference is larger than the energy cutoff of the phonon density , which is determined by the size of the quantum dot @xmath58 , the probability of phonon - assisted processes vanishes . thus , for the @xmath59  mev the relaxation becomes slower again .",

    "this case corresponds to the regime which is common in the recently performed transport and optical experiments .",
    "thus , in order to properly describe the electron dynamics , the full non - markovian description including the off - diagonal coupling to the lattice degrees of freedom has to be used . in the case of energy differences",
    "much larger compared to the tunneling coupling , the markovian approximation delivers the same results as the quantum kinetic description .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a full description of the electron dynamics in the presence of the electron - phonon coupling in a quantum dot molecule doped with a single electron .",
