    "one of the open classical problems in discrete geometry is the moser s worm problem , which originally asked for `` the smallest cover for any unit - length curve '' . in the other words , the question asks for a minimal universal cover for any curve of unit length  also called unit worm .",
    "although it is not clearly stated in the original problem , in this report , we will only concern ourselves with convex covers .    in 1979 ,",
    "laidacker and poole @xcite proved that such minimal cover exists .",
    "however , finding this minimal cover turns out to be much more difficult . instead , there have been attempts trying to estimate the area of this minimal cover . in 1974 , gerriets and poole @xcite constructed a rhombus - shaped cover with an area of 0.28870 , thus establishing the first upper bound for the problem .",
    "later , norwood and poole @xcite improved the upper bound to 0.2738 , while wetzel @xcite conjectured the upper bound of 0.2345 .",
    "on the other hand , the lower bound for the problem has not been as extensively studied . in 1973 , wetzel @xcite showed that any cover has an area at least 0.2194 , exploiting the fact that such cover must contain both a unit segment and the _ broadworm _ @xcite .",
    "this lower bound has only recently improved to 0.227498 @xcite , using the following facts :    * any convex universal cover must contain a unit segment , an equilateral triangle of side length @xmath0 and a square of side length @xmath1 .",
    "* the minimum area of the convex hull of these three objects provide a lower bound for moser s worm problem .    in this paper ,",
    "we generalize these ideas by considering an arbitrary rectangle instead of the square . in section 2",
    ", we provide a lower bound for the convex hull area of a set of points and a rectangle , and then apply the technique to a universal cover problem . as a result ,",
    "in section 3 , we improve the lower bound for the moser s problem to 0.232239 . in section 4 , we consider a variation of the moser s problem : we try to estimate an area of a universal cover for any unit closed curve .",
    "only partial results were established by wetzel in 1973 when he showed that a translational cover for any unit closed curve must have area between 0.155 and 0.159 @xcite .",
    "we are able to show that a convex universal cover must have area at least 0.0879873 .",
    "let @xmath2 be a polygon with vertices @xmath3 , we denote by @xmath4 the area of the convex hull of @xmath2 . we also denote by @xmath5 the area of the convex hull of @xmath6 , where @xmath7 are sets in a plane .",
    "next , we define    given segments @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the _ height _ of @xmath8 with respect to @xmath9 is the length of the perpendicular segment from either @xmath10 or @xmath11 to the parallel of @xmath9 passing another point .",
    "we denote this height by @xmath12 ( figure [ example ] ) .",
    "first , we provide a lower bound for the convex hull area of any four points on a plane .",
    "let @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 be points in @xmath17",
    ". then @xmath18 .",
    "[ r ]    without loss of generality , we can rotate the figure so that @xmath19 is horizontal and @xmath15 is above @xmath19 .",
    "we can also relabel points to ensure that @xmath15 is above @xmath16 , as well as , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath20 be the distance from the point @xmath15 to @xmath19 , and @xmath21 the distance from @xmath16 to @xmath19 .",
    "note that the convex hull of @xmath22 always contain triangle @xmath23 and so @xmath24 . if @xmath16 also lies above @xmath19 , then it is clear that @xmath25 ( figure [ lemmacase2 ] ) and we have @xmath26 .    otherwise ,",
    "if @xmath16 lies below @xmath19 , we notice that @xmath22 contains both triangles @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and the two triangles do not intersect except on @xmath19 .",
    "hence , @xmath29 , and the equality holds when @xmath22 is convex ( figure [ lemmacase1 ] ) .",
    "@xmath30    the next proposition provides a lower bound for the convex hull area of a rectangle and four arbitrary points on the same plane .",
    "let @xmath31 be a rectangle and @xmath32 be points on the same plane .",
    "assume that @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "then @xmath35    without loss of generality , we can assume that the slope of @xmath8 is finite and non - negative .",
    "let @xmath36 be the strip between extension of @xmath37 and @xmath38 and @xmath39 be the strip between extension of @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( figure [ strips ] ) .    to eliminate redundant cases on the position of four points @xmath32 relative to the strips @xmath36 and @xmath39",
    ", we note that by reflecting across the perpendicular bisector of @xmath37 and re - labeling @xmath15 and @xmath16 as necessary , we can ensure that @xmath16 lies under both @xmath39 and @xmath15 . specifically , if @xmath16 initially lies above @xmath39 , so is @xmath15 and the reflection will bring both points below @xmath39 .",
    "otherwise , if @xmath16 initially lies inside @xmath39 , from the assumption that @xmath34 , @xmath15 must lie above @xmath39 and the reflection and re - labeling of @xmath15 and @xmath16 will bring @xmath16 below both @xmath39 and @xmath15 as desired .",
    "similarly , we can ensure that @xmath13 lies to the left of @xmath36 by using reflection across the perpendicular bisector of @xmath8 and re - labeling of points @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , because the reflection around the perpendicular bisector of @xmath8 does not affect the relative positions of @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath39 , and vice versa , we can obtain both conditions simultaneously .",
    "next , we consider four cases for whether @xmath15 lies above @xmath39 and whether @xmath14 lies to the right of @xmath36 .",
    "* case 1 : * @xmath15 lies above @xmath39 and @xmath14 lies on the right of @xmath36 .",
    "if no pair of triangles @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 intersects ( figure [ case11 ] ) , then we directly obtain the following lower bound for the convex hull area : @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , are the respective heights of triangles @xmath40 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath41 .",
    "this can also be written as @xmath49 and the equality holds when @xmath50 is convex .    when some triangles intersect , because of the conditions on the positions of @xmath51 , and @xmath16 , triangle @xmath40 can not intersect @xmath42 , triangle @xmath43 can not intersect @xmath41 , and no three triangles can have nonempty intersection .",
    "we pick the case where @xmath52 as a representative example and subsequently show that , in general , we can always find a set of disjoint triangles lying inside the convex hull of @xmath50 whose total area is greater than or equal to the sum of areas of triangles @xmath40 , @xmath43 , @xmath42 , and @xmath41 .    for the two triangles @xmath42 and @xmath41 to intersect",
    ", both @xmath14 and @xmath16 must lie below @xmath39 and to the right of @xmath36 ( figure [ caseinter ] ) .",
    "we then draw a line @xmath53 passing through @xmath14 parallel to @xmath38 and a line @xmath54 passing through @xmath14 parallel to @xmath55 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath16 must lie either above @xmath54 or to the right of @xmath53 .",
    "hence , we see that either @xmath56 or @xmath57 , and obtain the bound @xmath58 .",
    "note that none of these triangles can intersect @xmath40 , @xmath59 , @xmath43 , or @xmath60 because @xmath15 lies above @xmath39 and @xmath13 lies to the left of @xmath36 .",
    "if triangles @xmath40 and @xmath43 also intersect , we can indenpendently apply the same consideration as above and derive a similar bound .    for the sake of simplicity , consider the case where @xmath40 and @xmath43 are disjoint and compute the following lower bound for the convex hull area @xmath61 and thus inequality [ main ] holds when @xmath15 lies above @xmath39 and @xmath14 lies on the right of @xmath36 .",
    "* case 2 : * @xmath14 lies on the right of @xmath36 but @xmath15 does not lie above @xmath39 .",
    "we now ignore triangle @xmath43 and consider only @xmath40 , @xmath42 , and @xmath41 . if @xmath41 intersect @xmath40 or @xmath42 , we can use the same argument from case 1 to show that we can always find a set of disjoint triangles lying inside the convex hull of @xmath50 whose total area is greater than or equal to the sum of areas of triangles @xmath40 , @xmath42 , and @xmath41 .",
    "moreover , since @xmath15 does not lie above @xmath39 , the height of @xmath41 with base @xmath55 is greater than or equal to @xmath62 , and so we have @xmath63    * case 3 : * @xmath15 lies above @xmath39 but @xmath14 does not lie on the right of @xmath36 .",
    "this case is analogous to case 2 .",
    "* case 4 : * @xmath15 does not above @xmath39 and @xmath14 does not lie on the right of @xmath36 .",
