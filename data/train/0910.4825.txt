    "the recent accelerated expansion of the universe is one of the most important discovery in the cosmology . whether this observed acceleration is due to some new hypothetical energy component with large negative pressure ( dark energy ) within the framework of general theory of relativity , or due to modification in the gr at the cosmological distances ( modified gravity ) , is not known .",
    "therefore many models have been proposed in literature to understand the origin and nature of this present acceleration  @xcite .",
    "basically the cosmic acceleration affects the expansion history of the universe . therefore to understand the true nature of this driving force , mapping of the cosmic expansion of",
    "the universe is very crucial  @xcite .",
    "hence , we require various observational probes in different redshift ranges to understand the expansion history of the universe .",
    "the observational tools for probing the cosmic acceleration broadly fall into two categories : geometrical and dynamical probes .",
    "a _ geometrical probe _",
    "deals with large scale distances and volume which include luminosity distance measurements of sne ia , angular diameter distance from first cmb acoustic peak , baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) etc .. a _ dynamical probe _ investigates the growth of matter density perturbations that give rise to the large scale structure such as galaxies , clusters of galaxies etc . in the universe .",
    "using supernovae as standard candles is a popular method of constraining the properties of dark energy .",
    "though this method is very simple and useful in constraining the various dark energy models , at present the luminosity distance measurements suffers from many systematical uncertainties like extinction by dust , gravitational lensing etc .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "measuring the expansion history from growth of matter perturbations also has its limitations .",
    "it requires prior information of exact value of matter density , initial conditions , cosmological model etc .",
    "so the question arises , `` is there any probe which is simple , depends on fewer priors and assumptions ? ''",
    "the possible probe is `` cosmological redshift drift '' ( crd ) test which maps the expansion history of the universe directly .",
    "the crd test is based on very simple and straightforward physics . however , observationally it is a very challenging task and requires technological breakthroughs  @xcite .",
    "the most remarkable feature of this probe is that it measures the dynamics of the universe directly - the hubble expansion factor .",
    "this property makes it very special and unique .",
    "further , it assumes that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic at the cosmological scales [ for more details see ref .",
    "the time drift of the cosmological redshift probes the universe in the redshift @xmath1 , whereas the other cosmological tests based on sne ia , bao , weak lensing , number counts of clusters etc . have not penetrated beyond @xmath2 .",
    "the other advantage of this tool is that it has controlled systematical uncertainties and evolutionary effects of the sources .",
    "the aim of this letter is to employ crd test to constrain various accelerating models both within the framework of gr and beyond gr .",
    "we have used _ simulated data points _ for redshift drift experiment generated by monte carlo simulations with the assumption of standard cosmological model ( @xmath3 cdm ) as reference  @xcite .",
    "we put constraints on the quintessence models ( based on scalar field potentials ) like pngb , inverse power law and exponential potentials .",
    "the dark energy parametrization which has a variable equation of state is also investigated .",
    "we also put a bound on the @xmath0 gravity models i.e. , starobinsky model using the cosmological redshift drift test .",
    "the letter is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we review the theoretical basis of cosmological redshift drift test .",
    "we also present here methodology and data used for this work .",
    "various models which can explain late time accelerated expansion of the universe are described in section 3 .",
    "last section contains a summary and discussion of results .",
    "a test which can trace the dynamical expansion history of the universe was proposed by sandage  @xcite .",
    "the expansion of the universe is expressed in terms of a scale factor , @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , the time evolution of the scale factor , or change in redshift , @xmath5 , directly measures the expansion rate of the universe .",
    "the redshift , @xmath6 , of an object as determined today will be different from its measured value after a time interval of several years .",
    "sandage also stressed on the fact that the redshift drift signal , @xmath5 , is very small .",
    "the significance of this tool has been discussed by several authors  @xcite .",
    "loeb was the first to suggest the possibility of measuring the redshift drift by observing ly@xmath7 absorption lines in the spectra of quasars ( qsos )  @xcite .",
    "this reinforced the importance of this probe .",
    "the observed redshift of a distant source is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the time at which the source emitted the radiation and @xmath10 is the time at which the observation is made . in writing the above expression",
    ", we ignore any peculiar motion of the object .",
    "the redshift of the source after the time interval of @xmath11 becomes @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the emission time interval for the source . in the first order approximation",
    "we can write @xmath14 or @xmath15\\ ] ] the above equation is also known as mcvittie equation  @xcite .",
    "this clearly shows that @xmath5 traces @xmath16 , which is the hubble factor at redshift @xmath6 .",
    "as stated earlier @xmath5 measures the rate of expansion of the universe : @xmath17 and @xmath18 indicates the accelerated and decelerated expansion of the universe , respectively . for a coasting universe @xmath19 .",
    "the redshift variation is related to the apparent velocity shift of the source : @xmath20 thus we can write @xmath21\\ ] ] where @xmath22 and @xmath23 . in a standard cosmological model ( @xmath3cdm ) , with a time interval of @xmath24 yr , the change in redshift is @xmath25 , for a source at redshift @xmath26 .",
    "the corresponding shift in the velocity is of the order of @xmath27 cm / s . to measure this weak signal ,",
    "loeb pointed out that observation of the ly@xmath7 forest in the qso spectrum for a decade might allow the detection of signal of such a tiny magnitude .      in the near future",
    ", a new generation extremely large telescope ( elt , 25 - 42 m diameter ) equipped with a high resolution , extremely stable and ultra high precision spectrograph ( codex ) should be able to measure such a small cosmic signal .",
    "the codex ( cosmic dynamics experiment ) operates in the spectral range of 400 - 680 nm with resolving power r = 150000 .",
    "several groups have performed monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of quasars absorption spectra  @xcite and obtained the @xmath28 measurements . in this work",
    "we have used three sets of data ( 8 points ) for redshift drift experiments generated by mc simulations  @xcite .",
    "these three datasets are generated by three different approaches @xcite .",
    "the data set with error bars are generated by assuming the total duration of 20 years for observations and standard input cosmological model with @xmath29 km / s / mpc , @xmath30 and @xmath31 . in every approach",
    "it is assumed that normalized observational set - up parameter , @xmath32 , equal to 2 .",
    "this parameter controls the telescope size , efficiency and integration time . in",
    "the _ first _ approach , the data points are selected by smallest value of @xmath33 . in this approach set of 20 qsos are distributed in the four equally sized redshift bin .",
    "second _ set of data points are generated by selecting the targets by larger value of @xmath34 . in this case , @xmath35 are distributed in two redshift bins .",
    "finally the _ last _ two data points are generated by increasing the sensitivity of data towards @xmath36 .    in principle , redshift experiment involve the measurement of velocity shift between pair of spectra of same object separated by large time interval of many years . as mentioned earlier , there are many candidates available for this measurement but the most promising one is the absorption features of the ly@xmath7 forest in the high redshift qsos .",
    "the main reason is that the peculiar motion associated with intervening gas is negligible as compare to cosmic signal and numerous lines are present in the single spectrum . using mc simulations , the desired statistical error on velocity shift",
    "can be written as @xmath37 with @xmath38 for @xmath39 and @xmath40 for @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the signal - to - noise ratio is of the order of 13500 per 0.0125 @xmath43 pixel , @xmath44 is the total number of quasar spectra observed and @xmath45 is their redshift .",
    "qsos are the brightest sources which exist even at the redshift close to 6 and since we are observing it from ground , the existence of atmosphere put the lower limit of redshift @xmath46 . using full mc simulation to achieve a radial velocity accuracy of 3 cm / s , can be obtained with 3200 hours of observation with 42 m elt . for more details see ref .",

    "we perform the @xmath47 analysis to find the best fit values of the cosmological parameters and to find the bounds on them , @xmath48 where @xmath49 are the model parameters . here",
