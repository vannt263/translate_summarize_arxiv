    "could be produced by the ( @xmath8 @xmath9 ) and ( @xmath8 @xmath10 ) reactions .",
    "however , the renaissance in this field started after the prediction of deeply bound @xmath11 states by calculations performed by akaishi and yamazaki in ref .",
    "@xcite and followed by several subsequent publications @xcite .",
    "the experimental search was initiated at the kek 12 gev proton synchrotron in japan by the finding of peaks in the nucleon spectra of @xmath12-absorption in @xmath13he @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 interaction has been found to be strongly attractive in the isospin @xmath14 channel and , as a consequence of that , nucleons are attracted by the @xmath15 meson to form dense nuclear states . in 1963 , in ref .",
    "@xcite nogami first examined three possible isospin configurations of the @xmath16 system and discussed the possible existence of the bound state using a rather crude calculation .",
    "the primary focus was on the lightest kaonic system @xmath17 because it has two @xmath18 pairs with isospin @xmath14 that can be considered as a building block of a three - body kaonic cluster .",
    "regardless of the fact that two protons are not bound , there is an expectation that @xmath6 interactions can be strong enough to bound the @xmath17 system .",
    "interestingly enough , even two protons can be bound by a single @xmath19 meson and it is assumed that this would be the strongest binding cluster among the three - body systems !    on the experimental side , several experiments have been performed to search for the kaonic @xmath0 cluster using various reactions .",
    "the first measurement reported by the finuda collaboration was the measurement of the invariant mass distribution of the @xmath9 produced by @xmath20absorption by @xmath21li , @xmath22li , and @xmath23c at the e@xmath24e@xmath25 rings of the da@xmath26ne machine in frascati @xcite .",

    "however , the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite claimed that the finuda data can be explained without postulating the existence of the @xmath0 bound state and suggested that the peaks of the proton spectra come from the @xmath12 absorption on a pair of nucleons , leaving the rest of the nucleons as spectators .",
    "interestingly enough , even though such a mechanism can not be completely excluded , there exists the further counter - arguments @xcite against the interpretations of stopped-@xmath12 experimental data of the finuda group by @xcite .",

    "the enormously large bump structure observed in the @xmath40 missing mass and the @xmath41 invariant - mass spectra at 2.85 gev indicate a possible candidate for the formation of a compact @xmath0 cluster with large binding energy . the binding energy and width were determined to be 103@xmath293(stat)@xmath295(syst )",

    "the predicted values for the binding energy and the width are in considerable disagreement : 995 mev and 20110 mev , respectively .",
    "the serious theoretical discrepancies concerning @xmath17 binding and width essentially come from different starting ansatzes : phenomenological _ _  _ _ @xmath15-nucleon potential constructed using @xmath6 scattering data and the data of kaonic hydrogen atomic shift together with the ansatz that @xmath59(1405 ) resonance is a bound state of @xmath6 system , a chiral ansatz for @xmath60 interaction that leads to a substantially shallow @xmath6 potential , and the calculation methods .",

    "later , two of the authors of @xcite repeated their calculation in @xcite using two models with the energy - independent and energy - dependent potentials for the @xmath76wave @xmath260 interaction , and their calculations yield smaller values for the binding energy 44 - 58 mev and width 34 - 40 mev @xcite . recently in ref .",

    "the width is about 50 - 65 mev .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the faddeev calculations for the energy - independent models for the @xmath6 interaction @xcite predict a deeper binding energy than that of the energy - dependent description of the @xmath6 interaction @xcite .",
    "our calculations obtained with both methods confirm that the effective @xmath6 interaction derived from chiral su(3 ) dynamics yields a shallowly bound @xmath0 cluster , while the phenomenological energy independent ay potential predicts much deeper binding energy for all considered @xmath1 interactions .",

    "although the fca to the faddeev equation makes a static picture of the two nucleon and does not consider the recoil of the spectator nucleon , this approach provides reasonable values for the binding energy and width , as seen from table tab5 , and qualitatively corroborates findings done with other methods which are technically much more involved .",
    "the study of @xmath0 with @xmath169 was performed using the method of hyperspherical functions in configuration space @xcite and in the momentum representation @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the binding energies and widths of the three - body @xmath17 cluster are calculated using the realistic av4 @xcite @xmath1 potential and a subthreshold energy - dependent chiral @xmath6 interaction derived with a chiral model @xcite .",

    "calculations of the binding energy and the width with the method of hh in the momentum representation @xcite reproduced the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , and we assume the slight difference arised from the difference between using av4 and av18 potentials and perhaps is related to the conversion of the hyperspherical expansion .",
    "however , most importantly , our results and those of the previous hh calculations @xcite are in good agreement and support the conclusion that the key role in binding the @xmath0 system is played by the @xmath255 interaction and the @xmath6 potential obtained based on chiral su(3 ) dynamics leads to binding energies of relatively low values . also , these calculations show that the binding energies are small and the widths are more than twice that of the binding energies .",
    "therefore , all model calculations with the @xmath6 interaction derived based on the chiral unitary approach predict a shallow binding state with very large width for the @xmath0 cluster .",
    "this is a precautionary indication that it may be difficult to experimentally observe the @xmath0 cluster .",

    "a discrepancy obtained is related to a problem of the equivalent representation of the potentials in momentum and configuration spaces .",

    "moreover , the @xmath0 cluster is the most strongly quasi - bound three - body system .",
    "the results of our calculations within the dfe and hh methods show that the binding energy of the @xmath0 system depends entirely on the ansatz for the @xmath6 interaction and substantially changes when we use a phenomenologically constructed @xmath55 potential @xcite and a @xmath6 potential obtained within the framework of the chiral unitary approach @xcite .",
    "perhaps the ambiguity of the @xmath6 interaction stems from an accuracy of description of experimental data for the energy shift in the kaonic hydrogen atom and @xmath75 scattering by the @xmath6 potentials .",
    "related to the sensitivity of the binding energy to the details of the @xmath1 potentials ref .",
    "@xcite  mentioned that as long as the @xmath0 system is only weakly bound , the dependence on different types of @xmath1 interactions is weak .",
    "in fact , our study confirms this conclusion and , moreover , shows that the dependence on different types of @xmath1 interactions is also weak if the @xmath0 system is strongly bound . using the formalism of the faddeev equations , we may separate channel configurations of the total wave function of the system .",
    "we have shown that the configuration ( @xmath75 ) + @xmath9 with the singlet isospin state of the pair @xmath75 dominates in the system due to strong @xmath75 interaction .",
    "we have seen that , on the background of the @xmath6 potential , different @xmath1 interactions weakly effluent to the bound state energy .",
    "it has to be noted that the @xmath88-wave models , with the simplifications taken , provide reasonable description of the system .",
    "the analysis of data presented in table [ tab5 ] shows that the width is always larger than the binding  energy .",
    "particularly for some calculations , the width is more than twice as much as the binding energy .",
    "thus , we are facing a situation in which the states have a much larger width than binding energy , which makes the experimental observation challenging @xcite and it may be hard to identify the resonance .",
