    "weak absorbers ( those with  @xmath20   rest frame equivalent width @xmath21   ) represent a population or populations distinct from the stronger absorbers which are directly associated with luminous galaxies ( l @xmath22l@xmath23 ) .",
    "this conclusion is based partly upon a rapid rise in the equivalent width distribution of @xmath24 at values below @xmath25   @xcite .",
    "it is also partly based upon the excess of single - cloud weak absorbers , over that expected from the poisson distribution of number of clouds per system found for strong absorbers @xcite .",
    "the single - cloud weak absorbers comprise @xmath26 of the weak absorber population at @xmath16 , with the remainder having multiple clouds in absorption .",
    "the single - cloud weak absorbers tend to have metallicities @xmath27 times the solar value , and in some cases greater than the solar value @xcite .",
    "though data are limited , it is clear that most single - cloud weak absorbers are not produced by lines of sight very close to luminous galaxies , though most are found at impact parameters of @xmath28-@xmath29  kpc @xcite .",
    "thus their high metallicities are surprising .",
    "furthermore , the large ratio of to column density in some weak absorbers indicates that `` in situ '' star formation is responsible for their enrichment @xcite .",
    "photoionization modeling of the single - cloud weak absorbers has established the existence of two phases , a high density region that is @xmath30  pc thick and produces narrow ( @xmath31few ) low ionization lines , and a kiloparsec scale , lower density region that produces somewhat broader , high ionization lines .",
    "there are often additional , similar low density regions within tens of of the one that is aligned with the absorption .",
    "@xcite argue that filamentary and sheetlike geometries are required for the single - cloud , weak absorbers , based on a census of the absorber populations at @xmath32 , and discussed possible origins in satellite dwarf galaxies , in failed dwarf galaxies , or in the analogs to milky way high velocity clouds . the earlier work of @xcite considered population iii star clusters , star clusters in dwarf galaxies , and fragments in type ia supernovae shells as possible sites for production of weak absorbers .",
    "most recently , @xcite have argued that the close alignment in velocity of the and absorption is also suggestive of a layered structure such as expected for supernova remnants or for high velocity clouds sweeping through a hot corona .",
    "single - cloud weak absorbers have possible implications for star formation in dwarf galaxies and in the intergalactic medium , and for tracking the populations of dwarf galaxies and/or high velocity clouds to high redshifts .",
    "for example , @xcite noted that the peak at @xmath33 of the star formation rate in dwarf galaxies may be related to the evolution of the weak absorbers . to understand the relative importance of the processes that produce weak absorption , it is crucial to have accurate measures of the evolution of their number densities .",
    "multiple - cloud weak absorbers may also be important as a tool to trace evolution of dwarf galaxies and other metal - rich gas too faint to see at high redshifts .",
    "because of their abundance , the dwarf galaxy population should present a significant cross section for absorption , yet so far their absorption signatures have been hard to recognize .",
    "although some of the multiple - cloud weak absorbers are surely an extension of the strong absorber population , others are kinematically compact , and are possibly related to dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "it is of interest to have a survey of weak absorbers large enough to separately consider the evolution of multiple - cloud weak absorbers .",
    "there have been three comprehensive surveys for weak absorbers , each focused on a different redshift regime .",
    "* hereafter crcv99 ) report on a survey for weak systems in the interval @xmath16 , @xcite covered the range @xmath34 , and more recently ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter lct06 ) discovered weak systems in the redshift interval @xmath19 .",
    "these studies followed the earlier , smaller surveys by @xcite and @xcite , who first established that the equivalent width distribution of absorbers continues to rise below @xmath35   . the number density ( @xmath6 ) constraints from the surveys collectively demonstrate an evolution in the absorber population over the redshift interval @xmath36 , comprising the last @xmath37  gyr history of the universe .    for their survey of weak systems",
    ", crcv99 searched a redshift pathlength of @xmath38 in the hires / keck spectra of 26 qsos .",
    "thirty weak systems were identified in the interval @xmath39 in that survey , which was @xmath40% complete down to an rest frame equivalent width sensitivity limit of @xmath41   . from the weak systems",
    "identified , they estimated a redshift path density @xmath42 for @xmath43 , and for @xmath44   . later , using stis / hst uv echelle spectra of 20 quasars , @xcite found that analogs to weak absorbers at @xmath45 also exist in the present universe . from the six systems detected in a redshift pathlength of @xmath46 within the redshift window @xmath47 , a @xmath6 of @xmath48 was estimated for @xmath49 .",
    "lct06 presents the most recent survey for weak absorbers . from a data set of 18 qsos , observed using the uves / vlt",
    ", a total of 9 weak systems were found over a redshift path of @xmath50 in the interval @xmath19 , yielding a @xmath51 for @xmath52 .",
    "that survey was @xmath53 complete down to a rest frame equivalent width of @xmath3   .    in order to interpret the apparent evolution in the @xmath6 of weak absorbers",
    "it is necessary to consider the effect of the changing extragalactic background radiation ( ebr ) .",
    "the ebr is known to diminish in intensity by @xmath54  dex from @xmath55 to @xmath56 , and by @xmath57  dex from @xmath45 to @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "this changing ebr will have an effect on , what might otherwise be a static population of absorbers , due to a change in the balance between high and low ionization gas .",
    "however , what we would predict from the ebr evolution would be an increase in @xmath6 from @xmath59 to @xmath58 .",
    "this makes the smaller observed @xmath6 at @xmath60 quite significant , in that it implies a real decrease in the population from @xmath12 to @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "similarly , lct06 found that the increase in @xmath6 from @xmath8 to @xmath12 was significantly larger than that predicted from the effect of the changing ebr ( and the expected cosmological evolution ) .",
    "thus , in light of the results from the three surveys , it can be argued that there has been a slow build up of weak systems from high redshift , with their number density reaching a peak at @xmath45 , and subsequently evolving away until the present time .    the goal of the present study is to determine more precisely how @xmath6 evolves at @xmath61 .",
    "the lct06 survey identified an overall trend in number density evolution , but was limited by small sample size .",
    "our sample covers @xmath62 times more lines of sight than lct06 .",
    "this will allow us to constrain @xmath6 for smaller redshift bins in order to measure a peak redshift for the incidence of weak absorption .",
    "a larger sample will also allow us to look separately at the evolution of the single - cloud and multiple - cloud weak absorption , which is important because they are likely to originate in different types of structures .",
    "finally , we will examine the equivalent width distribution for weak absorbers , and consider its evolution .    in   [ sec:2 ]",
    "we describe the vlt / uves dataset and outline our procedures for reducing the spectra and for searching for weak doublets . ",
    "[ sec:3 ] presents the formal results of our survey , including the redshift path density for @xmath63   absorbers at @xmath1 , separates this into single - cloud and multiple - cloud weak absorbers , and presents the equivalent width distributions at @xmath12 and @xmath8 .",
    "a summary and discussion is given in the final section of the paper .",
    "our sample of 81 quasar spectra used for the survey was retrieved from the eso archive . since there is no comprehensive method to find all quasar spectra in the archive , we searched for programs with titles and abstracts that seemed relevant .",
    "we then retrieved all @xmath64 spectra made available before june 2006 .",
    "the spectra were obtained to facilitate various studies of stronger metal - line absorbers and of the forest , but in no case should there be a particular bias toward or against weak systems .",
    "we eliminated several spectra which had @xmath65 pixel@xmath66 over their full wavelength coverage because those would compromise our survey completeness at small equivalent widths .",
    "the reduction and wavelength calibration of the echelle data were carried out using the eso provided midas pipeline . to enhance the @xmath67 ratio of the spectra , all available observations of a particular target",
    "were included in the reduction .",
    "the reduced one dimensional spectra were vacuum ",
    "heliocentric velocity corrected and rebinned to @xmath68   , corresponding to the pixel width in the blue part of the spectrum . the different exposures for a particular target were each scaled by the median ratio of counts from the exposure with the best @xmath67 to the counts from that exposure itself .",
    "this puts all the exposures on the same relative flux scale .",
    "the scaled spectra were then co - added , weighting by the @xmath67 corresponding to each pixel .",
    "continuum fitting was done on the reduced spectra using the iraf sfit procedure .",
    "the spectra were then normalized by the continuum fit .",
    "table  [ tab:1 ] provides a detailed list of the quasars that were used for this survey .",
    "the uves offers a large wavelength coverage , from @xmath69   to @xmath70  @xmath71 m , thus spectra often include many different chemical transitions for an absorption system .",
    "however , the wavelength coverage available for individual quasar spectra varied , based on the choice of cross - disperser settings . combining exposures from various settings",
    "therefore sometimes resulted in gaps in wavelength coverage .",
    "in addition to wavelength gaps , we systematically excluded the following path lengths from our formal search : ( 1 ) wavelength regions blueward of the emission line , as they are strongly affected by forest lines ; ( 2 ) wavelength regions that are within 5000 of emission corresponding to the redshift of the quasar , as any absorption line within this regime has a higher probability of being intrinsic ; and ( 3 ) regions of the spectrum that are polluted by various atmospheric absorption features , including the a and b absorption bands from atmospheric oxygen .",
    "the elimination of wavelength regions that are affected by the telluric lines was complicated , since some spectra were affected more than others .",
    "this prohibited us from eliminating equal redshift paths from all quasars , since by doing so we would have discarded wavelength regions that are suitable for searching weak lines .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] illustrates the redshift path length that was available in each quasar spectrum for an search .",
    "the wavelength regions that were thickly contaminated with telluric lines ( typically at @xmath72   ) were eliminated if the observed equivalent width of a significant number of those lines were equal to or greater than the @xmath3   ( the lower equivalent limit of our survey ) .",
    "the possibility of chance alignment between atmospheric lines , in most cases , was resolved by confirmation with associated absorption features that were covered and detected .",
    "this confirmation procedure was most feasible for at high redshifts , where additional metal lines for the system ( such as  @xmath73  @xmath74 , ,  @xmath73  @xmath75 , etc . )",
    "are covered in the blue portion of the wavelength coverage .      in searching for systems in the included redshift path of each quasar spectrum , we first assumed every absorption line detected at an equivalent width limit of @xmath76 as the  @xmath73  @xmath77 line of a possible doublet .",
    "a candidate system was considered if there was at least a @xmath78 detection of the corresponding @xmath73  @xmath79 line for the same redshift .",
    "the lines of the doublet were also visually inspected for comparable profile shapes and for a doublet ratio between 1:1 and 2:1 .",
    "the detected system was considered to be a weak absorber if the measured rest - frame equivalent width , @xmath24 , was less than @xmath25   . to further confirm the detection",
    ", we also looked for associated metal lines ( e.g. , , , , etc . ) and that were covered and likely to be detected for weak systems .",
    "weak doublets that were found within @xmath80   of each other were taken as part of the same absorbing system , and are therefore classified as one multiple cloud system . in one case ,",
    "the system at @xmath81 towards q  @xmath82 , grouping together two weak components , separated by @xmath83  , in this way led to a classification as a strong absorber , and thus exclusion from our survey .",
    "finally , as in crcv99 , in order to be considered as a separate system , a weak absorber must be at least @xmath84   from any strong absorption .    using the @xmath0 qso lines of sight , we detected @xmath85 weak system in total .",
    "out of this , @xmath86 systems are within the redshift interval @xmath1 .",
    "our redshift coverage drops significantly at @xmath87 , and therefore we limit our survey to within @xmath1 .",
    "this further helps to directly compare our results to the preceding surveys of crcv99 and lct06 , which were also confined to the same redshift interval .",
    "table  [ tab:2 ] provides the complete sample of weak absorbers that we identified , and figures  [ fig:2a]  [ fig:2e ] illustrate the absorption profiles of a few example cases from the systems that we identified .",
    "( _ the absorption profile of all systems identified in our survey will be published in the online version of the journal _ ) .    in our doublet search , a certain number of candidate  @xmath73  @xmath77 features , with detections at the position of the corresponding @xmath79 turned out to be chance alignments . to illustrate that these cases are well - understood and do not lead to significant uncertainty in our sample , we describe those instances :    1 .   in the spectrum of q  @xmath88 ,",
    "a candidate weak doublet was detected at redshift @xmath89 .",
    "visual inspection showed that the profile shapes of the doublet lines were inconsistent with each other .",
    "the  @xmath73  @xmath77 feature was later identified as the  @xmath73  @xmath90 line of a from an absorption system at @xmath91 , further confirmed by the presence of at @xmath92   .",
    "2 .   in the spectrum of q  @xmath93 , a candidate weak doublet was detected at @xmath94 for which the was covered , but not detected .",
    "subsequently , the  @xmath73  @xmath79 feature was identified as the  @xmath73  @xmath95 line of the doublet at @xmath96 for which associated , , ,  @xmath73  @xmath75 ,  @xmath73  @xmath97 ,  @xmath73  @xmath98 , etc . , were also detected .",
    "a possible weak detection was found at @xmath99 along the line of sight to q  @xmath82 and was ruled out as chance alignment because of significant mismatch between profile shapes .",
    "metal lines , such as , , or and , for this prospective system were not covered in the spectrum .",
    "4 .   the candidate absorption feature at @xmath100 in the spectrum of q  @xmath101 did not have any high ionization or detected .",
    "what was identified as the  @xmath73  @xmath77 feature was subsequently identified as the  @xmath73  @xmath74 absorption line for the weak system at @xmath102 .",
    "the possible detection at @xmath103 in q  @xmath104 was dismissed from consideration as a weak system since the  @xmath73  @xmath77 and @xmath79 profile shapes were not consistent with expectations for a doublet .",
    "the detection of and for that redshift could not be confirmed , since those features would have been located in the region of the spectra that was densely populated by forest lines .",
    "other low ionization transitions , such as  @xmath73  @xmath97 or  @xmath73  @xmath75 , did not fall within the wavelength coverage of the spectrum .",
    "the candidate @xmath105 system in q  @xmath106 was ruled out . it was considered a very unlikely candidate because of profile shapes between the members of the doublet not being consistent with each other , and also because of the equivalent width ratio , @xmath107 , being significantly less than 1 . and would have been in the region of the spectrum that was densly contaminated by the forest , and therefore could not be identified .    to facilitate comparison with previous surveys by crcv99 and lct06",
    ", we confine the equivalent width range of our survey to @xmath108   . of the @xmath85 weak systems detected in our survey ,",
    "three were measured to have @xmath109   ( refer table  [ tab:2 ] ) and they are excluded from our @xmath6 calculations . however , these weaker systems are extremely important to understand whether there is a turnover in the equivalent width distribution below some limiting value .",
    "similarly , our redshift coverage drops off dramatically below @xmath110 , with only four systems found , thus we limit our survey to the range @xmath1 .",
    "the survey completeness is dependent on the detection sensitivity at different equivalent widths over the redshift path length of the survey .",
    "the detection sensitivity , defined by the likelihood of detecting a weak doublet along a given path length to a quasar , is dependent on the quality of the spectrum and also on the strength of the absorption feature .",
    "the survey completeness was calculated using the formalism given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig:3 ] shows the completeness of our survey at different  @xmath732796 equivalent width limits .",
    "we find that our survey is 86  @xmath111 complete at the limiting equivalent width of @xmath3   , for the redshift path length @xmath1 . in comparison ,",
    "the crcv99 survey was 80  @xmath111 complete for @xmath16 , and lct06 was 100  @xmath111 complete for @xmath19 and for the same equivalent width limit .",
    "the higher completeness of lct06 is due to their sample of @xmath112  qsos having better @xmath67 .",

    "of this redshift pathlength , @xmath120 is in the lower redshift regime ( @xmath16 ) , as compared to @xmath121 for crcv99 .",
    "our coverage in the higher redshift regime ( @xmath19 ) is @xmath122 as compared to @xmath123 for lct06 .    for systems within the equivalent width range",
    "@xmath44   , the number densities for the various redshifts intervals ( chosen for comparison with previous surveys ) are listed in table  [ tab:3 ] .",
    "our larger survey size enabled the error bars in these estimations to be constrained to values smaller than those for the previous surveys .",
    "figure  [ fig:4 ] shows the @xmath6 values for the various redshift ranges .",
    "our @xmath6 estimate is , in general , consistent with the results from previous surveys . for the redshift bin @xmath124 ,",
    "the constraints from crcv99 and lct06 differed by more than @xmath125  @xmath126 .",
    "our result for this redshift bin is closer to the measurement from crcv99 , suggesting that the lct06 point was off because of statistical fluctuations due to the small sample .",
    "it is important to note that our @xmath127 datapoint is in agreement with the earlier survey of lct06 .",
    "this is an important verification that we are correcting our numbers appropriately to account for the fact that the spectra in our larger sample were , on average , of slightly lower quality than those surveyed by lct06 .    in figure",
    "[ fig:5 ] , we focus on just the present vlt / uves sample , and examine evolution of weak absorbers within the redshift interval @xmath19 more sequentially , with smaller redshift bins ( @xmath4z @xmath128 ) .",
    "we can now see that not only is there a drop in the number density of weak absorbers at @xmath129 , but it appears to be a steady drop . there is a distinct peak in @xmath6 in the bin centered at @xmath15 .    classifying the absorption systems in our sample as single cloud ( a single kinematic component ) and/or multiple cloud ( with more than one kinematic components ) , we also calculated the redshift number densities of both classes separately for the various redshift bins .",
    "these are shown in also shown in figure  [ fig:5 ] .",
    "for consideration of this issue , even our larger sample is suffering from small number statistics .",
    "however , we see that both single - cloud and multiple - cloud weak absorbers do appear to exhibit a rise and then a fall in their number densities between @xmath130 and @xmath110 .      the equivalent width distribution of systems is typically parameterized by fitting the data using either an exponential relationship of the form    @xmath131    where n@xmath23 and @xmath132 are best - fit parameters , or a power - law relationship of the form @xmath133 where c , a constant , and @xmath134 , the power law index , are best - fit parameters .",
    "using a single power law , with @xmath135 and @xmath136 , crcv99 were able to produce an acceptable fit to the equivalent width distribution of both strong and weak systems , with the exception of the bin centered on the strongest absorbers at @xmath137   .",
    "the distribution indicated that , at @xmath12 , there is a drastic increase in the number of systems toward the weak end of the distribution , with no indication of turn over in the power law distribution down to @xmath138   ( see fig .",
    "6 of crcv99 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig:6 ] shows the distribution function from results based on our survey for the redshift interval @xmath16 and for @xmath139   .",
    "the redshift interval and equivalent width lower limit were selected to be coincident with the values used by crcv99 .",
    "since the equivalent width distribution is rapidly rising toward small values , it is critical to make comparisons in the same bins .",
    "for the three equivalent width bins at @xmath140   , the distribution for the bins centered at @xmath141   and @xmath142   are consistent with the results from crcv99 survey , to within @xmath143 .",
    "however , our measurement of @xmath144 for the lowest bin , at @xmath145   , is roughly a factor of two less than the crcv99 result , a difference of @xmath146 .",
    "our measurement shows that there _ is _ a turn - over from the power law equivalent width distribution suggested in crcv99 , for @xmath147   .",
    "we considered the possibility that we are missing some of the weakest systems in our survey , but we think this is quite unlikely . our survey is @xmath148  % complete at the lower equivalent width limit of @xmath149   , whereas the crcv99 survey , in comparison , is @xmath150  % complete at that same limit .",
    "we also note that if we use a limiting equivalent width of @xmath151   the discrepancy between the two survey results is at a negligible @xmath152 level .",
    "thus we confirm that our results at @xmath16 are in agreement with crcv99 in the sense that weak systems exceed strong systems in number by a factor of @xmath153 .",
    "more recently @xcite presented results from a larger survey of strong absorption systems , identified in the spectra of @xmath154 sdss quasars .",
    "the equivalent width distribution of their sample ( @xmath155   ) was fit using the exponential form described in equation ( 3 ) , however the fit parameter , @xmath132 and the resultant normalization @xmath156 , were @xmath143 lower than the parameters derived from the much smaller survey of @xcite .",
    "figure 6 shows the fits from the various parameterizations for the equivalent width distributions of strong absorbers , with the more accurate results of @xcite shown as the dashed curve .",
    "it is evident that an extrapolation of the exponential fit to the strong absorbers significantly underestimates the incidence of weak systems at @xmath12 .      in figure  [ fig:7 ] , we present the equivalent width distribution for weak absorbers in the range @xmath19 , and compare to that of the @xmath16 from our vlt / uves sample . all low redshift datapoints are higher than the corresponding high redshift datapoints , due to the larger overall @xmath6 at @xmath12 than at @xmath8 . the plot is log / linear in order to facilitate comparison to the equivalent width distribution of strong absorbers .",
    "@xcite computed this distribution at redshift @xmath157 , fitting it with the parameters @xmath158 and @xmath159 . in fig",
    ". 7 , this function is given as a solid line .",
    "in fact , our datapoints for the @xmath160@xmath161   and @xmath161@xmath25   bins are consistent with an extrapolation of the equivalent width distribution for strong absorbers .",
    "even the @xmath162@xmath160   bin is only a factor of two above the extrapolation .",
    "in contrast , fig . 7 also shows that at @xmath39 , there are significantly more weak absorbers ( in all three equivalent width bins ) than expected from an extrapolation of the strong absorber distribution function .",
    "the discrepancy is more than a factor of ten in the @xmath162@xmath160   bin .",
    "we have surveyed the vlt / uves spectra of 81 quasars to search for weak absorbers over a redshift path @xmath163 , in the range @xmath1 .",
    "our survey is 86% complete at a rest - frame equivalent width limit @xmath3   .",
    "we confirm the result of lct06 of a declining number density , @xmath6 of weak absorbers at @xmath129 , finding a peak at @xmath164 ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "this general behavior is exhibited separately for the single and multiple - cloud weak absorbers .",
    "there may be differences in the evolution of these two classes , but they can not be distinguished with a sample of the present size .",
    "at @xmath12 , the equivalent width distribution function for weak absorbers , shown in figure  [ fig:7 ] , rises substantially above an extrapolation of the exponential distribution that applies for strong absorbers @xcite .",
    "however , at @xmath8 , not only do we see a smaller number of weak absorbers relative to the expectations from evolution , in figure  [ fig:7 ] we see only a slight excess over the extrapolation of the strong absorber distribution",
    ".    there may not be a very large separate weak absorbers population at @xmath8 , and at higher redshifts .",
    "for example , if we were to extend a linear fit to the four highest redshift datapoints in figure  [ fig:5 ] , we would predict there would be no weak absorbers at @xmath165 .",
    "clearly , such an extrapolation is not realistic , since weak absorption is likely to have multiple causes at any redshift , however it highlights the fact that there really is a drastic evolution occurring .",
    "lct06 pointed out a rough coincidence between the peak period of incidence in weak absorbers ( at @xmath45 ) and the global star formation rate in the population of dwarf galaxies .",
    "more generally , it seems plausible that the evolution in @xmath6 of weak absorbers would relate to the rates of processes that give rise to this absorption .",
    "this remains feasible in view of the findings of our present survey .",
    "however , a variation of this type of scenario comes to mind based upon a recent study of the kinematics of strong absorbers by @xcite . in this new scenario",
    "it is not that the weak absorbers are not being generated at @xmath166 . instead",
    ", these structures would be evident , at high redshift , as parts of different types of absorbers , mostly as components of strong absorbers .",
    "the basis of this suggestion is this hypothesis that there is a three way connection between weak absorbers , satellite clouds of strong absorbers , and the extragalactic analogs of the milky way high velocity clouds @xcite . at @xmath33",
    "many galaxies exist that are morphologically and kinematically similar to those in the present epoch @xcite .",
    "typically , they have a dominant absorbing component as expected for a galaxy disk , with one or two weaker outlying components ( i.e. satellite clouds ) separated by @xmath167@xmath168   from the main one .",
    "these satellite clouds look very similar to milky way high velocity clouds in their multiphase absorption properties @xcite .",
    "they also seem similar to single - cloud weak absorbers , which seem to have sheetlike or filamentary structures @xcite , perhaps like those of milky way high velocity clouds .",
    "furthermore , if weak absorbers are predominantly found @xmath28@xmath169  kpc from luminous galaxies , since they have a substantial cross  section relative to the galaxies themselves , it seems plausible that they are related to high velocity clouds .",
    "@xcite find an evolution in the kinematics of strong absorbers over the same redshift range that we are claiming evolution of the weak absorbers .",
    "the nature of the evolution is that the strong systems have a larger number of components at @xmath170 than at @xmath33 , though their velocity spreads do not change .",
    "these extra components are very weak , but they act to fill in most of the velocity space spanning the full range of absorption .",
    "there are no longer separate and distinct `` satellites '' , nor is there evidence for single , well - formed galaxies .",
    "in fact , this seems quite analogous to the changes that take place in the visible morphologies of galaxies from @xmath170 to @xmath33 . at the higher redshift galaxies",
    "typically have a clump - cluster @xcite or tadpole - like morphology , with many separate star - forming regions .",
    "the kinematics of these systems are surely complex and it is likely that gas is spread through the region .    finally , returning to the evolution of the weak absorbers that we have surveyed .",
    "we propose that the absence of them at @xmath170 may be related to a lower probability of passing through just a single weak absorber .",
    "if the gas that produces absorption is really so irregularly distributed at @xmath170 as suggested by the strong absorber kinematics , this seems plausible .",
    "it is a particularly appealing explanation if weak absorbers are the extragalactic high velocity clouds clustered among the protogalactic structures in a typical group .",
    "the structures that would produce single ",
    "cloud components and those that would produce multiple  cloud absorbers may be similar in this respect , in that both might tend to be kinematically connected at @xmath170",
    ". it would be rare to observe an isolated single  cloud weak absorber because it would be kinematically connected to other absorbers .",
    "the same could apply for multiple  cloud weak absorbers if they are also produced by structures that tend to be concentrated around galaxies . at @xmath33",
    "these same types of structures form , not necessarily at an increased rate , but those that do form tend to be more separated from other absorbing structures for a longer period of time .",
    "this could produce the peak in the @xmath6 distribution of weak absorbers that we observe at @xmath33 .",
    "subsequently , the processes that produce the structures that produce weak absorption ( and perhaps high velocity clouds as well ) may decline in order to give rise to the declining @xmath6 to the present .",
    "near  ir surveys of weak absorbers at @xmath171 will be needed to determine if the decline found up to this redshift continues up to higher values .",
    "furthermore , detailed comparisons of the physical properties of weak absorbers and the satellite clouds surrounding strong absorbers .",
    "finally , comparisons of the evolution of the ensemble of absorbers to the ensemble of gas distributions in high redshift groups , both from an observational and theoretical point of view , is ultimately needed .",
