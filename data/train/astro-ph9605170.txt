    "ultraviolet ( uv ) imaging is a powerful tool for the study of galaxies .",
    "recent star formation and low - level nuclear activity can be traced and measured in uv images , unhindered by the bright background of the older stellar populations which dominate in visual bands .",
    "the source of uv emission in some quiescent early - type galaxies can also be studied with uv imaging .",
    "prior to the launch of the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) , few galaxies were imaged in the uv . these few were mostly local group spiral galaxies observed at low angular resolution using rocket - borne telescopes on brief flights ( see bohlin et al . 1990 , and references therein ) .",
    "this situation has improved in recent years with the flight of uv imaging telescopes on the space shuttle ( e.g. , landsman et al .",
    "1992 ; hill et al .",
    "1992 ) , although the angular resolution is still low and the number of galaxies observed is small , due to the limited mission duration . in this respect , _ hst _ , with its high sensitivity and angular resolution , has opened up a new frontier .",
    "summaries of recent _ hst _ uv - imaging studies of galaxies appear in benvenuti , macchetto , & schreier ( 1996 ) .",
    "we have carried out a uv imaging survey with the pre - costar _",
    "hst _ faint object camera ( foc ) of the central regions of 110 large nearby galaxies , selected randomly from a complete sample of 240 galaxies",
    ". the main purposes of the survey are ( a ) to detect low - luminosity active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , exploiting the high contrast of a nuclear uv continuum source above the low uv background from stars , and ( b ) to study star formation in the central regions of the galaxies ; by observing at @xmath13  , the survey images detect primarily the youngest existing stellar populations and thus provide a clean probe of the most recent sites of active star formation , uncontaminated by light from more evolved stars .",
    "the power of this technique , especially when augmented by the high _ hst _ angular resolution , has been recently demonstrated in uv studies of starbursts by conti & vacca ( 1994 ) , meurer et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , and maoz et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "maoz et al .",
    "( 1995 ) presented data from the survey for nine galaxies displaying bright compact nuclear uv sources , five of which are potential low - luminosity agns .",
    "maoz et al .",
    "( 1996 ) analyzed the images of five additional galaxies having circumnuclear star - forming rings , and showed that much of the star formation in the rings is confined to massive compact clusters that are probably bound . in a forthcoming work ( ho et al .",
    "1996b ) we will use the uv images to analyze the star - formation properties of all the galaxies in the sample . in this paper , we present images and basic data for the 110 galaxies observed .",
    "the images provide a reference for the uv brightness and morphology of the galaxies in the sample , which can be used as a general guide to the uv properties of the centers of galaxies , and as an aid in extracting the actual data from the _ hst _ archive .",
    "we also provide a classification of the uv morphology , additional notes on some of the galaxies and what is seen in their images , and a measurement of the @xmath0   flux integrated over the image .",
    "we tabulate these together with the larger - scale properties of the galaxies and ( for the northern galaxies ) the spectroscopic nuclear classification from ho , filippenko , & sargent ( 1995 , 1996a ) . in  2 , below , we describe the sample selection and the observations . in ",
    "3 we present tables listing the galaxy parameters , a pictorial atlas of the data , and notes on some of the individual galaxies . in  4 we intercompare the uv and optical properties of the galaxies and provide a brief summary .",
    "the sample from which the observed galaxies were chosen consists of all galaxies in the ugc and eso catalogs ( lauberts & valentijn 1989 ) with heliocentric velocities available in the literature and less than @xmath14 km s@xmath4 , and photographic diameters ( as defined in the catalogs ) greater than @xmath15 .",
    "a total of 22 galaxies were removed from this initial sample of 262 galaxies during subsequent stages of the sample definition . in 21 of these , no nuclear position could be defined because they were too diffuse , too low in surface brightness , or edge - on with strong dust lanes .",
    "one galaxy ( eso 1331@xmath164517 ) had a bright foreground star near the nucleus , which would have endangered the _ hst _ instruments .",
    "this left a well - defined sample of 240 galaxies with observable nuclei .",
    "twenty - seven galaxies from this sample were not included in our target list because they were proposed targets of other _ hst _ uv - imaging programs",
    ". however , we have subsequently obtained from the _ hst _ archive the data for seven of these galaxies which were actually observed with an instrumental configuration similar to the one we used ( foc + uv filter at @xmath0  ) .",
    "digitized photographs from the gasp archive at space telescope science institute ( stsci ) of all potential target galaxies were examined and the coordinates of the nucleus determined to @xmath17 precision by computing the centroid of the light distribution . in a few cases , as evidenced by the eventual _ hst _ images , the galaxy nucleus position was off by up to @xmath18 , due to isophote distortion by dust features in the gasp images .",
    "the observations were done in snapshot mode  i.e. , targets were chosen from the target list by the stsci staff based on the convenience of their location on the sky .",
    "the brief exposure was used to fill the gaps left in the observing schedule after other science programs had been scheduled .",
    "the observed galaxies are therefore an unbiased selection from the complete sample .    among the galaxies described in this paper , 103",
    "were successfully observed with _",
    "hst _ while the program was active , in 1993 , march through july .",
    "we supplement these observations with data for the seven out of the 27 `` embargoed '' galaxies that were observed with _ hst _ between 1991 and 1995 .",
    "we therefore have data for a total of 110 galaxies out of the complete sample of 240 galaxies .",
    "observations were unsuccessful for four galaxies due to wrong coordinates ( ngc 660 ) or telescope malfunction ( ngc 3714 , eso 0514@xmath163709 , and ngc 3137 ) ; we do not count these among the successful 110 observations , even though data files for them exist in the _ hst _ archive .",
    "all of our images were obtained with the _ hst _ @xmath19 foc ( paresce 1990 ) in its `` zoomed '' @xmath20-pixel mode with @xmath21 pixels , giving a field of view of @xmath1 . the f220w filter was used .",
    "this is a broad - band filter with an effective wavelength of @xmath0   and effective bandpass of @xmath22  .",
    "the exposure time was 10 minutes per galaxy .",
    "we will refer to this configuration and exposure time as the `` standard setup . ''",
    "the images were processed by stsci s `` pipeline '' reduction ( baxter et al .",
    "1994 ) , after which the pixel scale is @xmath23 pixel@xmath4 .",
    "the data were obtained before the _ hst _ repair mission at the end of 1993 , and therefore are affected by spherically aberrated optics . as a result ,",
    "the point - spread function ( psf ) consists of a sharp core of full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) @xmath5 that contains about 15% of the light , with the rest of the light spread in a complex low - level `` halo '' with a radius of several arcseconds ( burrows et al .",
    "1991 ) . in the observing mode",
    "we have used , the foc is limited in its dynamic range to 255 counts ( 8 bits ) per zoomed pixel ; additional signal causes the counts to `` fold over '' and start again from 0 .",
    "another problem is that the detected count rate becomes nonlinear , gradually saturating for bright sources ( see baxter et al .",
    "the central pixels of most of the compact bright sources detected in the images may be in the nonlinear regime , and the brightest of them are clearly saturated . in several galaxies where we report the brightness and/or angular size of individual compact sources , our analysis relies mainly on the wings of the psf , which have low count rates ( @xmath24 s@xmath4 pixel@xmath4 ) , using the algorithms described by maoz et al .",
    "( 1995 , 1996 ) .",
    "we model the psf using a well - exposed f220w image of a star observed with the foc @xmath25 @xmath26 pixel mode , which has a large dynamic and linear range ( but small field of view ) .",
    "such empirical psfs are required for work in the uv ( baxter et al .",
    "1994 ) .    as in maoz",
    "( 1995 , 1996 ) , we translate the foc counts to a flux density @xmath27 at 2270    assuming 1 count s@xmath28 erg s@xmath4 @xmath29 @xmath4 , based on the on - line calibration data available from stsci for the foc and f220w filter , with a 25% increase in sensitivity of the @xmath30 zoomed - pixel mode relative to the @xmath31 pixel mode ( baxter et al .",
    "this calibration assumes a spectrum that is constant in @xmath27 .",
    "as detailed in maoz et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , the f220w count - rate vs. @xmath27 at 2270   is weakly dependent on the spectral slope , with a change of only a few percent for a large range in slopes .",
    "the uncertainty in the absolute flux is @xmath32% when measuring individual compact sources ( baxter et al .",
    "1994 ) , but can be as small as @xmath33% when measuring the uv flux integrated over large areas ( e.g.  @xmath34 arcsec@xmath7 ; meurer 1995 ) , if the background can be reliably determined .",
    "an additional concern in uv imaging photometry is the presence of `` red leaks '' through the f220w filter , which we define as light of wavelength @xmath35   that may pass the low , but non - zero , transmission of the filter at these wavelengths .",
    "this can be a problem when observing very red sources , e.g. , the centers of the early - type galaxies in our sample . tests by the foc team indicate that the f220w transmission curve is not significantly changed from that measured before launch ( baxter et al . 1994 ) , i.e. , it peaks at @xmath36   and falls monotonically to the red , decreasing by a factor of @xmath37 between 2200   and 4400  . using this transmission curve together with the foc+_hst _ efficiency as a function of wavelength , and the spectral energy distribution templates of early - type galaxies measured by kinney et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , we calculate that a @xmath38-band surface brightness of 13.7 mag arcsec@xmath39 produces one red - leak count per dezoomed pixel in a 600 s foc+f220w exposure . in other words , an ( unrealistic ) galaxy with _ no _ flux below 3200   needs to have a @xmath38 surface brightness brighter than 13.7 mag arcsec@xmath39 in order to be detected through the red leak in our standard setup .",
    "lauer et al . (",
    "1995 ) have measured with the pre - costar _",
    "hst _ the @xmath38-band surface - brightness profiles of 45 nearby early - type galaxies",
    ". none of their galaxies have an observed ( i.e. before deconvolution of the aberrated psf ) surface brightness brighter than 13.7 mag arcsec@xmath39 within a radius of @xmath40 , so none would have a detected red - leak signal in our foc exposures , even within this small ( 4.4 foc pixels ) radius . at a radius of @xmath41 , where we can still detect a clear uv signal with the foc from many of the early - type galaxies in our sample , lauer et al .",
    "( 1995 ) measure a surface brightness of 15 mag arcsec@xmath39 for the brightest galaxies in their sample , and typically 1718 mag arcsec@xmath39 .",
    "we conclude that , even without any assumptions about the shape of the spectrum at wavelengths @xmath42   , the red leak contributes negligibly to the signal we detect from the reddest galaxies over most of the field of view .",
    "we note that ngc 2997 , a spiral galaxy with a a circumnuclear ring , has an _ hst",
    "_ wfpc2 6000   image which maoz et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have analyzed in conjunction with its foc 2300   image .",
    "we have convolved the 6000   image , which is free of spherical aberration , with the pre - costar psf , and measured the surface - brightness profile .",
    "the nuclear region , which at a radius of @xmath40 has a @xmath38 surface brightness of 14.6 mag arcsec@xmath39 , is expected to produce only 0.4 foc counts pixel @xmath4 through the f220w red leak .",
    "the nuclear region is , indeed , undetected in the uv image , as expected if the f220w transmission curve has its pre - launch values longward of 3200  .",
    "this comparison also sets an upper limit , of a factor of 2 , by which the f220w transmission curve could be off from its pre - launch value . as a further test , we note that two of the galaxies for which lauer et al .",
    "( 1995 ) present @xmath38-band profiles , ngc 1023 and ngc 4636 , are in our sample as well , and for both we detect with the foc faint centrally - peaked diffuse light distributions .",
    "in ngc 1023 , we measure with the foc 2.3 counts pixel@xmath4 at the @xmath40 radius , while lauer et al.s ( 1995 ) observed @xmath38-band surface brightness at this radius , of 14.8 mag arcsec@xmath39 ( t. lauer , private communication ) , is similar to that of ngc 2997 , which produces no detected f220w counts .",
    "ngc 4636 has 1/2 as many foc counts as ngc 1023 at @xmath40 , even though its observed @xmath38 surface brightness is 8 times lower at this radius ( t. lauer , private communication ) .",
    "the foc counts for both ngc 1023 and ngc 4636 must therefore be dominated by true uv flux .",
    "this is also confirmed for ngc 1023 by the flux at 2300   measured with the _ international ultraviolet explorer _ ( _ iue _ ; kinney et al .",
    "1993 ) , which is consistent with the flux deduced from the foc observation , assuming no red leak ( see  3.3 ) .",
    "the seven archival images which we also include in this atlas were obtained with different foc formats , uv filters , and exposure times , providing modified fields of view , bandpasses , and sensitivities .",
    "one of these , of ngc 4151 , was obtained in 1995 , after the first _",
    "hst _ servicing mission , and so is free of spherical aberration .",

    "see  3.3 for details .",
    "the background was determined as follows .",
    "the mean counts per pixel were measured in seventeen @xmath59-pixel squares in the frame , excluding occulting fingers and distortions in the foc field ( see baxter et al . 1994 ) , and the median counts per pixel were measured over the entire exposed part of the frame .",
    "the mean of the two lowest among these 18 measurements was used as the background value , and the standard deviation of the five lowest among the 18 measurements was used as the uncertainty in the background .",
    "the uncertainty in the background was propagated to an uncertainty on the total net counts in the image .",
    "the count rate above the background was converted to a uv flux density as described in  2 .",
    "the flux uncertainty due to the background uncertainty was combined in quadrature with a 5% absolute calibration uncertainty ( meurer 1995 ) to produce the quoted flux uncertainty . except for bright and concentrated sources ,",
    "the flux uncertainty is dominated by the uncertainty in the background determination .",
    "the cause of artificial background variations across the image is imperfect flat - fielding .",
    "furthermore , a systematic error in background determination is unavoidable due to the small field of view , which covers only a fraction of the optical extent of these galaxies .",
    "some of this systematic error is accounted for by the above procedure for estimating the background uncertainty . nevertheless",

    "( kinney et al . 1993 ; see also meurer 1995 ) , which has a comparable entrance aperture .",
    "this suggests that the regions of the images with the lowest counts are , in fact , devoid of significant uv emission .",
    "the uv fluxes given here should be used with care , and in conjunction with the uv - morphology classification ( column 17 ) and the visual appearance of the image .",

    "we have rechecked the coordinates and pointing of the blank ( `` b '' morphology ) images , and verified that they are not cases of telescope mispointing . as a check on the pointing accuracy , there are about 40 images which display a feature that can be securely associated with the nucleus of the galaxy . in almost all cases it is within @xmath60 of the center of the image , as expected from the combined uncertainty in the gasp coordinates of the nucleus and the _ hst _ pointing accuracy . in the few cases where the nucleus is further from the image center , this has been traced to inaccurate input",

    "the blank images are also not the result of foreground milky - way extinction , except for two galaxies , ngc 1560 and ngc 6946 , which lie near the galactic plane .",
    "dust in the disks of the galaxies themselves is probably a factor , since 10 out of 13 galaxies with b morphologies have minor - to - major axis ratios less than 0.5 ( i.e. , an inclination @xmath61 ) . the fact that the centers of many galaxies are weak uv emitters is confirmed by the detection of very weak ( `` w - type '' ) but significant and centrally concentrated emission in many of the galaxies , which establishes that the galactic nucleus is , indeed , in the field of view .",

    "<S> we present an atlas of uv ( @xmath0  ) images , obtained with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) faint object camera , of the central @xmath1 of 110 galaxies . the observed galaxies are an unbiased selection constituting about one half of a complete sample of all large ( @xmath2 ) and nearby ( @xmath3 km s@xmath4 ) galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first extensive uv imaging survey of normal galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the data are useful for studying star formation , low - level nuclear activity , and uv emission by evolved stellar populations in galaxies . at the _ hst _ resolution ( @xmath5 ) </S>",
    "<S> , the images display an assortment of morphologies and uv brightnesses . </S>",
    "<S> these include bright nuclear point sources , compact young star clusters scattered in the field or arranged in circumnuclear rings , centrally - peaked diffuse light distributions , and galaxies with weak or undetected uv emission . </S>",
    "<S> we measure the integrated @xmath0   flux in each image , classify the uv morphology , and examine trends between these parameters and the optical properties of the galaxies .    </S>",
