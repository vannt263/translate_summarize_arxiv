    "in many fields of science , stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) in infinite dimensions often in form of stochastic partial differential equations ( spdes ) are used to model problems with uncertainties . since many of the considered equations",
    "can only be solved numerically , the numerical analysis of such sdes has gained a lot of attention in the literature over the last two decades .",
    "most of the numerical methods used for approximating the infinite - dimensional solution process @xmath0 are based on a discretization in space by means of a family @xmath1))$ ] of finite - dimensional subspaces of the original solution space ( with refinement parameter @xmath2 ) and on a time discretization with step size @xmath3 . for many of these numerical methods ,",
    "strong and partly also weak convergence results are available in the literature , ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite for an overview ) , where the authors investigate the asymptotic behaviour with respect to @xmath4 .",
    "however , for numerical simulations we are restricted to a fixed refinement parameter @xmath2 in space and a time step size @xmath5 .",
    "for this reason , we investigate in this article the asymptotic qualitative behaviour of approximations of @xmath0 as time @xmath6 for fixed refinement parameters @xmath7 and @xmath5 .",
    "we focus on the asymptotic mean - square stability analysis of approximations of linear sdes attaining values in a real separable hilbert space  @xmath8 , i.e. , we consider the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath9 $ ] as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 denotes an approximation of @xmath12 .",
    "a lot of effort has been dedicated to the asymptotic mean - square stability analysis of solutions of sdes in finite dimensions , see e.g. ,  @xcite , as well as in infinite dimensions , see e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "the mean - square stability analysis of numerical approximations of sdes started by considering the approximations of the one - dimensional geometric brownian motion , see e.g. ,  @xcite . as it has been pointed out in  @xcite ,",
    "the mean - square stability analysis of linear sde systems in higher dimensions and their approximations is also necessary , since the asymptotic behaviour of the corresponding mean - square processes of systems with commuting and non - commuting matrices are in general not equal .",
    "the tools to perform mean - square stability analysis of sde approximations presented in  @xcite can also be used for approximations of infinite - dimensional sdes by a method of lines approach : after a spatial discretization ( by , e.g. , a galerkin finite element method ) the mean - square stability properties of the resulting finite - dimensional system of stochastic differential equations and the corresponding approximations can be determined by considering the eigenvalues of @xmath13-dimensional matrices , where @xmath14 denotes the dimension of @xmath15 . however , due to the computational complexity , neither the symbolic nor the numerical computation of these eigenvalues can be done for arbitrarily large systems .",

    ", mean - square stability analysis of approximations of @xmath8-valued sdes is very important , since there exist frequently used numerical techniques for approximating paths or moments of infinite - dimensional solution trajectories that require specific mean - square stability properties of the numerical solution . here , we mention the multilevel monte carlo ( mlmc ) estimator which is known to be a computationally efficient method to estimate quantities of interest @xmath17 $ ] , see , e.g. , @xcite for details",
    ". this estimator uses realizations of the solution process on a hierarchical collection of spatial and temporal refinement levels .",
    "consequently , it is necessary to use a sufficiently ( mean - square ) stable numerical approximation scheme on all levels ( especially on the coarsest levels ) to get a reasonable approximation of @xmath17 $ ] , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "we provide conditions under which the infinite - dimensional solution @xmath0 and its approximations based on backward euler schemes share the same mean - square stability properties without any restriction on the refinement parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the outline of this article is as follows : in section  [ sec : spde ] we set up the framework in which mean - square stability is considered . for this",
    ", we recall basic results on linear @xmath8-valued sdes driven by square - integrable , cdlg martingales and their approximations .",
    "section  [ sec : theory ] contains the theory of mean - square stability analysis for approximations of infinite - dimensional sdes in an abstract way . in the main result ,",
