    "recently a number of authors have proposed using renormalization ideas in the spirit of wilson in holographic descriptions of strongly coupled gauge theories  @xcite .",
    "( for earlier discussions , see  @xcite ) the radial direction in ads like spaces is dual to energy scale in the field theory  @xcite and one can imagine introducing a cut - off at some finite radius , splitting the supergravity solution in two . by integrating out the high energy regime",
    "an effective wilsonian description should emerge .",
    "the precise matching of the radial direction to a gauge invariant measure of energy scale remains an open problem so a precise match to wilsonian renormalization in the field theory will also remain imprecise but the spirit is clear .    in this paper",
    "we wish to bring these ideas to bare on some explicit examples of theories with phase transitions .",
    "we wish to study how those transitions emerge in the wilsonian language and will find examples of new transitions with changing wilsonian cut - off scale .",
    "we are also interested in deriving low energy effective actions near the transition points using this language .    in particular we will use the simple but highly instructive d3/d7 and d3/d5 systems  @xcite .",
    "the d3/d7 theory is the @xmath0 super yang - mills theory in 3 + 1 dimension with @xmath1 quark hypermultiplets . in the d3/d5 case",
    "the hypermultiplets are restricted to a 2 + 1 dimension sub - surface of the gauge theory . in the quenched limit ,",
    "when the number of quark flavours is small but the number of colours large , we can use the gauge / gravity dual consisting of probe d7(d5 ) branes in ads@xmath2s@xmath3 .",
    "this system has been widely explored ( for example in the d3/d7 case see @xcite and references therein and @xcite for the d3/d5 case ) and we will make use of a number of known phenomena . in these systems",
    "the radial coordinate on the probe brane plays the role of the renormalization group ( rg ) scale in the field theory .",
    "we will first introduce our methodology in the supersymmetric @xmath1 theory . that theory does not induce a chiral quark condensate ( which would break supersymmetry were it present ) but we can nevertheless attempt to find an effective potential for the quark condensate which should be minimized at zero . we will study its dependence on changing wilsonian scale .",
    "this introduces the first subtlety which is the need to define holographic flows for non - vacuum , `` off - shell '' , states in the field theory . in the uv , solutions of the euler lagrange equation for the d7 embedding exist for all values of the condensate .",
    "in fact we show analytically in this case that the d7 embeddings with non - zero condensate become complex at some finite ads radius . at any fixed radius",
    "the solutions that are still real do not share the same boundary condition so formally one should not cut them off and compare their actions . to remedy this",
    "we consider a cut - off with explicit width i.e. effectively two close cut - offs .",
    "we use the naive uv solutions down to the the higher cut - off but then match them to classical embeddings between the two cut - offs that share the same ir boundary conditions . after making this construction one can then take the limit where the cut - offs come together .",
    "in this case that limit leaves us just evaluating the uv flow s action down to the cut - off as one naively expects , however it prepares the ground work for later more complicated cases .",
    "if the cut off is taken too low then an embedding will become complex and computing the action is impossible .",
    "we interpret this as high energy states being integrated from the low energy effective theory - these states have energy above the cut off and are simply no longer present in the wilsonian effective ir theory .",
    "the precise meaning in the field theory of any cut - off we introduce of course is ambiguous but we presume there is some sensible mapping .",
    "indeed there are also many distinct ways in which a cut - off can be introduced in the field theory from a sharp cut on uv modes to some smooth function suppressing the uv contributions . using our prescription for the cut - off",
    ", we then evaluate the action of the d7 brane , which is just the free energy in the field theory . if we evaluate the uv component of that action above our cut - off we are simply determining the effective classical potential for the quark condensate that encapsulates the physics above that scale .",
    "this is the wilsonian effective potential .",
    "the deep ir of this potential only contains the vacuum state with the condensate equal to zero since all other states are associated with complex embeddings - we can though freeze the energy of those states at the point they are integrated out ( become complex ) to generate an ir effective potential .    in the presence of a magnetic field ,",
    "@xmath4,in the d3/d7 system a quark condensate is induced that breaks a @xmath5 chiral symmetry  @xcite . in this system",
    "we again study the effective potential for the quark condensate with changing wilsonian scale using the ideas so far developed . in the pure @xmath4 case the resulting rg flow shows a novel second order transition to the symmetry breaking configuration as the wilsonian scale is changed .",
    "this is an example of a strongly coupled coleman weinberg @xcite style symmetry breaking .",
    "we also holographically compute the effective potential close to the transition and show it is mean field in nature .",
    "we plot the rg flow of the couplings of the wilsonian effective potential . in the deep ir the effective potential for the condensate",
    "again develops gaps as embeddings become complex and are integrated from the low energy theory .",
    "the picture that emerges is satisfyingly wilsonian .",
    "the bare uv theory has no symmetry breaking ; at intermediate rg scales integrated out , uv , quantum effects enter the bare potential and display the symmetry breaking ; in the deep ir all states but the true vacuum are integrated from the low energy theory .",
    "the wilsonian approach gives a sensible intuition .",
    "the pure @xmath4 theory can also be related immediately to the case of a @xmath4 field and a perpendicular electric field , @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "these two theories essentially share the same action .",
    "the @xmath6 field  @xcite tends to dissociate quark bound states and so disfavours chiral symmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "we show that our previous results can be mapped to display the @xmath6 dependence of the wilsonian description .",
    "we next turn our techniques to analyze the d3/d7 system with a magnetic field and chemical potential  @xcite .",
    "the chemical potential tends to induce a non - zero quark density which also disrupts the chiral condensate . here",
    "the naive embedding flows for the d7 brane , describing different condensate values , all progress to the deep ir where they mostly end in a singular fashion .",
    "previously those flows that end at the position of the d3 branes ( the origin ) have been picked out to describe the physical vacuum  @xcite .",
    "the picture is that fundamental strings , representing the quark density , link the d3 and d7 brane .",
    "they manifest as a spike in the d7 brane embedding to the origin .",
    "the fundamental strings are needed to source the d7 brane world volume gauge field that is dual to chemical potential . to compare the actions of these vacuum flows and the off shell configurations ,",
    "the off shell configurations must be forced to have the same ir boundary conditions .",
    "we use our cut - off procedure to argue that in the deep ir the off - shell configuration should be completed with a spike of d7 brane to the origin .",
    "the natural extension of this procedure at non - zero cut - off values is that all configurations should be completed with a spike along the cut - off .",
    "having argued for this implementation of the cut - off we then analyze the wilsonian effective potential of this theory at fixed b but varying density .",
    "again we find a sensible wilsonian description with the uv theory showing no symmetry breaking .",
    "then , provided the density is sufficiently small , there is a transition with lowering cut - off scale to the chiral symmetry broken vacuum .",
    "this transition is in parts of parameter space first order and elsewhere second order and mean field .",
    "we can explicitly derive the effective potential through the transition . as the cut - off is taken into the ir the second order behaviour dominates and we perform a fit to the mean field potential .",
    "in this case we do not see the degeneracy of the potential in the deep ir we described in the supersymmetric and pure b case - none of the embeddings become complex .",
    "this might reflect that our cut - off prescription is overly naive .",
    "we simply report on what we find in this case .",
    "finally we study the d3/d5 system  @xcite with a magnetic field and density , @xmath7 , using our wilsonian methodology .",
    "this system is of further interest because it is known to exhibit a holographic bkt transition  @xcite at which the condensate grows as @xmath8 .",
    "here we again display the density versus cut - off phase diagram , in which there are first order transition regimes , second order regimes and finally for the cut - off in the deep ir a bkt transition .",
    "here we successfully derive an effective potential for the bkt transitions when the wilsonian scale goes to zero .",
    "we will begin by exploring a wilsonian analysis of the simplest model @xmath1 gauge theory which does not display chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the @xmath0 gauge theory at zero temperature is described by the dual geometry ( ads@xmath9 ) @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12",
    ".    quenched ( @xmath13 ) @xmath14=2 quark superfields can be included through probe d7 branes in the geometry .",
    "the d3-d7 strings are the quarks .",
    "d7-d7 strings holographically describe mesonic operators and their sources .",
    "the d7 probe can be described by its dbi action @xmath15_{ab } + 2 \\pi \\alpha ' f_{ab } ) } \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath16 and @xmath17_{ab}$ ] is the pullback of the metric and @xmath18 is the gauge field living on the d7 world volume .",
    "the wess - zumino term is irrelevant to our discussion .",
    "the gauge field holographically describes the operator @xmath19 and its source , a background @xmath5 gauge field for baryon number .",
    "we will use @xmath18 below to introduce a constant magnetic field ( eg @xmath20 )  @xcite but for the moment keep it zero .",
    "we embed the d7 brane in the @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 directions of the metric but to allow all possible embeddings must include a profile @xmath25 at constant @xmath26 .",
    "the full dbi action we will consider becomes one dimensional : @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29    the euler - lagrange equation for the embedding is then @xmath30    at large @xmath23 the classical solution from behaves as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is proportional to the quark mass and @xmath33 to the quark condensate .    numerically we can shoot into the ir from a uv solution with particular values of @xmath33 and @xmath32 . for the particular case @xmath34 we show such flows in fig . [",
    "new1](a ) .",
    "all except the @xmath35 solution appear to stop at some finite @xmath23 . in this case",
    "we can find the analytic solution to investigate this in more detail .",
    "the real solution valid in @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is @xmath38\\ ] ] with @xmath39    from ( [ lp ] ) we can see that the gradient of the embedding becomes complex at @xmath37 . these results match very well to the numerical results in fig [ new1](a ) and provide an explicit form for the behaviour at @xmath40 .",
    "the only solution that survives to @xmath41 is the flow with @xmath35 .",
    "one would naively like to plot the effective potential @xmath42 generated by the holographic flows to show the @xmath35 solution is the minimum .",
    "however , since all but one flow ( c=0 ) become ill - defined this is confusing .",
    "understanding why there is no ir effective potential provided by holography is one of our goals .",
    "we will adopt the recently suggested idea that we should approach the holographic description in a wilsonian manner .",
    "in particular we will introduce a cut - off in @xmath23 , the holographic direction for quark physics ( i.e. the radial direction on the d7 brane ) , which we will call @xmath43 and study the theory as a function of changing that cut - off .",
    "thus specifically to convert the `` off - shell '' flows , with non - vacuum values of the quark condensate , into kosher flows we will interrupt them with a cut - off at an intermediate value of @xmath23 . in the uv we find the euler lagrange equation solutions with large @xmath23 asymptotics @xmath44 and",
    "solve down to the cut - off .",
    "a technical issue arises at this point though .",
    "the flows ending on the cut - off do not share the same ir boundary conditions since they meet the cut - off at arbitrary angles .",
    "formally one should not compare their actions in a euler - lagrange analysis .    to cure this",
    "let us imagine a more general structure for our cut - off in which it has finite width .",
    "we introduce two cut - offs in @xmath23 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 . in the uv from infinite @xmath23 down to @xmath46 we use the flows in fig [ new1](a )",
    ". then we match these flows to flows beginning at @xmath45 with @xmath47 and ending at @xmath46 at the same point as the uv flows .",
    "we pick this boundary condition at @xmath45 because it naturally matches on to the boundary condition of the regular flows as @xmath48 ie @xmath49 .",
    "we show example flows in fig [ new1](b ) . now",
    "all of our flows have the same ir and uv boundary conditions .    having introduced this cut - off structure it is actually most natural to remove it by taking @xmath50 . in this example",
    "the flows between @xmath45 and @xmath46 simply become short straight lines whose action vanishes as the two cut - offs coincide .",
    "this digression therefore is just to justify that one can effectively consider the uv flows down to the common @xmath43 to share ir boundary conditions and directly compare their action sensibly . in other words",
    "we assume a small change to the flows at the cut - off that bends them to satisfy @xmath51 but assume this does nt make a large change to the action . here",
    "this seems rather trivial but we shall see much more structure emerge in the later example with density .",
    "we now proceed in this case with the single cut - off @xmath43 . for each choice of @xmath43 we can plot a potential ( density ) given by @xmath52 which is nothing but a euclidean on - shell action normalized by @xmath53 and a field theory volume ( so it is a density . ) .",
    "these actions diverge in the uv but the difference between them determines which is preferred ( or they can be regulated by adding a holographic counter term @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is a uv cut - off to be set to @xmath56 at the end ) .",
    "a minus sign comes from euclideanization . to regulate these flows",
    "we will always compute the difference in action from the flat embedding @xmath57 with the equivalent cut - off @xmath43 .",
    "the @xmath57 embedding will therefore always lie at @xmath58 in our plots .",
    "the potential should be viewed as the potential energy incurred for a particular value of the condensate from scales above the cut - off @xmath43 .",
    "in other words this potential is the equivalent of the potential in the `` bare '' lagrangian written down for the theory at the given cutoff which should be used in conjunction with quantum ( or holographic ) behaviour below the cut - off .",
    "this is exactly the wilsonian paradigm .      using the methodology described above we can now plot the wilsonian effective potential for the quark condensate as a function of cut off scale @xmath43 .",
    "we show this in fig [ new2 ] .",
    "reassuringly @xmath35 is the minimum of the potential at all values of the cut off as we would expect in the supersymmetric theory .",
    "the finite extent of the plots in @xmath33 is a result of solutions with larger @xmath33 having gone complex before reaching the cut off at @xmath43 .",
    "we interpret the removal of states with large values of the condensate from the effective potential as a sign that these states can not be reached with the energy available in the ir theory .",
    "this seems to match well with a wilsonian approach and explains the degeneracy if @xmath59 . in the examples below we will simply omit states that are not in the low energy theory in this sense .",
    "one could though simply freeze the potential value at the point where the embedding becomes complex and retain that value for lower choices of the cut off .",
    "we plot that version of the ir effective potential for the @xmath1 system as the dotted curve in fig [ new2 ] - again it is minimized at @xmath35 .",
    "we will now move on to study more interesting examples of gauge theories that induce chiral symmetry breaking in the ir .",
    "we next look at the @xmath1 theory with an applied magnetic field which induces a chiral condensate  @xcite .",
    "we introduce the b field through the d7 brane world volume gauge field in ( [ dbi1 ] ) .",
    "we now have @xmath60 at large @xmath23 the asymptotic solution is again given by ( [ asym ] ) and we can again interpret @xmath61 as the quark mass and condensate . in the absence of @xmath4",
    "the theory is conformal so it is natural to write all dimensionful parameters in units of @xmath62 , the intrinsic conformal symmetry breaking scale , which we do for our numerical work ( i.e. put @xmath63 ) .",
    "the solutions of the euler - lagrange equations for the embedding @xmath25 are well known  @xcite and we show two(b ) . however , we omit them since they are always meta - stable not a ground state . ] regular solutions with @xmath34 and with @xmath49 in fig [ profiles](a ) - numerically one shoots out from @xmath41 to find these .",
    "more generally one can seek such solutions for any mass @xmath32 and read off the condensate @xmath33 from the large @xmath23 asymptotics . in fig [ profiles](b )",
    "we show a plot of @xmath33 vs @xmath32 for the regular embeddings .",
    "it has the spiral structure discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the fig [ profiles](a ) solutions are the @xmath35 flat embedding and the largest @xmath33 solution with @xmath34 .",
    "the vacuum energy of these configurations can be found by integrating minus the holographic action over the @xmath23 coordinate .",
    "these actions diverge in the uv but the difference between them determines which is preferred ( or they can be regulated by adding a holographic counter term @xmath64 , where @xmath55 is a uv cut - off to be set @xmath56 at the end ) .",
    "the curving configuration shown , with the quark condensate , is the preferred state and the flat embedding is a local maximum of the effective potential .",
    "as in the previous example we would like to plot the effective potential @xmath42 generated by the holographic flows to show the solutions we have found are the turning points . to describe off - shell states we find numerical solutions of the embedding equation for massless quarks that look like @xmath65 at large @xmath23 and shooting into the interior .",
    "we plot these flows in fig [ offshell](a ) , where it can be seen that most fail to reach the @xmath66 axis or a deep ir cut - off .",
    "we expect that these are associated to the embedding becoming complex by continuity to the @xmath67 curves , although here we do not have analytic solutions .",
    "to proceed we again introduce a cut off . in fig",
    "[ offshell](b ) we show such a cut off with the two scale structure , @xmath68 that allows us to make the flows all share the same @xmath47 boundary condition . as with the pure supersymmetric case we can take @xmath69 limit trivially here , having a single cut off @xmath43 at which we end the flows .",
    "we now proceed in this case with the single cut - off @xmath43 evaluating the action integrated from @xmath43 to infinity .    in fig [ vvse ]",
    "we plot the potential as a function of @xmath43 for the d3/d7 system with magnetic field . when @xmath43 is large we are describing the uv lagrangian which has no preference for a quark condensate .",
    "as @xmath43 decreases we are `` adding in '' more of the strongly coupled quantum effects of the theory from lower scales to the bare potential .",
    "the first clear feature shown in fig [ vvse](a)-(c ) is that there is a phase transition at the critical value @xmath70 to the chiral symmetry broken phase .",
    "this transition is our first main result .",
    "one can think of this transition as being in the spirit of a coleman - weinberg transition - at high energies the theory has no condensate but then strongly coupled loop effects enter in the ir and break the symmetry .",
    "we will return to the deep ir later but let us first explore this phase transition in detail .",
    "in fig [ cve ] we plot the quark condensate against @xmath43 showing that the transition is second order .",
    "we also plot @xmath71 vs @xmath72 near the transition point from which we can extract the critical exponent as @xmath73 - the transition is a mean field one .",
    "in fact close to the transition we can perform a numerical fit to the potential we have derived of the form @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are functions of @xmath43 and @xmath4 . through the range @xmath77",
    "the fit gives @xmath78 and @xmath79 to better than a percent .",
    "the existence of such a potential ( which is not present in the far uv theory at all ) corresponds to the emergence of multi - trace operators in the spirit of the discussion in @xcite .",
    "we next plot the coefficients @xmath80 against @xmath43 in fig [ ab ] .",
    "@xmath75 and @xmath76 are approximated as linear functions close to the transition .",
    "@xmath75 is proportional to @xmath81 and @xmath76 is always positive .",
    "this is all standard mean field expectations . in fig",
    "[ fit](a ) we plot the potential for different @xmath43 on a single plot . in fig",
    "[ fit](b ) we plot the potential for values of @xmath43 close to the transition , where the points are the numerical data whilst the solid curves are our fit potentials .",
    "@xmath82    it is clear that the transition is well described by the expected mean field potential .",
    "we stress though that here we have derived this form holographically .",
    "another key feature is visible in fig [ vvse](d)-(e ) .",
    "when we impose a cut - off at @xmath83 we are excluding some range of condensates .",
    "in fact even for large @xmath43 , flows with very large @xmath33 become complex in the uv before they reach the cut - off as we saw in the @xmath1 supersymmetric theory .",
    "qualitatively it makes sense that if we write a wilsonian effective model at low energies then large condensate values should be excluded from the theory since such states would be completely integrated out - they have an energy above the cut - off .",
    "as we move to much lower @xmath43 , the deep ir , in addition some intermediate ranges of condensate also disappear from the effective description in the same fashion .",
    "this is why there are breaks in the potential plot for low @xmath43 .",
    "again qualitatively these states have such high energy relative to the low cut - off scale of the effective theory that they are integrated out .",
    "if @xmath43 is strictly taken to zero only the regular flows corresponding to the turning points of the potential have finite action .",
    "this is clear from fig [ offshell](a ) .",
    "the effective potential we are computing therefore degenerates in the deep ir . in this wilsonian language",
    "though this degeneration seems entirely appropriate - when we have integrated out anything above the vacuum energy it is no surprise we are left with only the vacuum state in our effective theory .",
    "in addition to the vacuum state we have considered so far , in principle , at @xmath84 there are an infinite number of meta - stable vacua near the flat embedding .",
    "this is shown in the self - similarity ( spiral ) structure in the @xmath33 vs @xmath32 plot in fig [ profiles](b ) .",
    "this self - similarity is realized in our wilsonian context as follows .",
    "when @xmath43 is large @xmath35 is the global minimum . as @xmath85 decreases it becomes a local maximum and a new ground state forms .",
    "this is shown in fig [ vvse](c ) .",
    "as @xmath85 decreases more , @xmath35 becomes a local minimum fig [ vvse](e ) , which is preparing to produce a new meta - stable vacuum .",
    "as @xmath85 decreases yet further then @xmath35 becomes a local maximum again fig [ vvse](f ) leaving a meta stable vacuum . this process ( from fig [ vvse](c ) to fig [ vvse](f ) )",
    "will continue as @xmath86 leaving more and more meta stable points .",
    "the first of these metastable vacua is visible in fig [ vvse](f ) where we have focused near the origin at yet lower @xmath43 .",
    "finally here we should comment that the precise meaning of these phase transitions and absent regions will depend on the precise choice of cut - off .",
    "the cut - off in @xmath23 seems natural in the d7 context but without a precise link between the holographic direction and the field theory rg scale there is some ambiguity .",
    "for example one could have chosen to make the cut - off at constant @xmath87 surface rather than constant @xmath23 .",
    "actually we find that particular choice unnatural because the true ir vacuum state would be missing from the @xmath88 theory since the chiral symmetry breaking flow does not hit @xmath89 .",
    "further at the point where the true vacuum disappears from the ir theory its vacuum energy remains above that of the flat embedding because the flat embedding has a missing contribution to its energy from where it extends below the cut off - we do nt see the true vacuum emerge at any scale .",
    "this discussion shows though that the choice of cut - off could be dependent on the explicit flow .",
    "although this identification remains an outstanding problem we believe the wilsonian style description we have presented is very plausible and qualitatively helpful in understanding the holographic description .",
    "it is clear from our wilsonian analysis above that the deep ir effective potential is highly degenerate .",
    "it is interesting though to track the form of the effective potential below the wilsonian second order transition we described above .",
    "we can again fit the potential at varying @xmath43 to a potential of the form in ( [ guess ] ) .",
    "in fig [ fig : ab ] we show the best fit values of the powers @xmath80 with @xmath43 .",
    "although @xmath75 stays close to 2 , @xmath76 rises fast at values of @xmath43 below the second order transition .",
    "of course this does not mean that the @xmath90 term is switching off but that the coefficients of @xmath91 type terms are becoming large - one could in principle use a more complex potential fitting form to see this behaviour . at lower values of @xmath43 than those shown in fig",
    "[ fig : ab ] the potential starts to become degenerate .    in the deep ir ( @xmath88 )",
    "only the vacuum configuration with @xmath92 and @xmath93 is described holographically .",
    "if one wishes one can imagine ( using dimensional analysis ) an effective potential of the form @xmath94 and fit for @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "we find @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "it is important to stress though that the form of this potential is not fixed by the holographic flows - we could have included more terms with higher powers of @xmath33 for example that would reproduce the computed values of @xmath33 and @xmath99 .",
    "also there is no sense in which this potential is derived away from the minimum - it is an off - shell effective potential extrapolated from on - shell values .",
    "that is is assumed to be true for off - shell @xmath33 values so that the condition @xmath100 makes sense .",
    "however , @xmath101 and @xmath102 are fixed only by on - shell data . in our off - shell method at finite @xmath43 above , @xmath101 and @xmath102",
    "are determined by the off - shell data .",
    "the on - shell action also describes a second order phase transition as @xmath103 . for @xmath104",
    "the quark condensate grows as @xmath105 as it must on dimensional grounds .",
    "it is important to stress the difference between this transition and the holographic transition we found above with changing @xmath43 at fixed b.      the pure b field theory is also very closely related to the theory with both a magnetic and perpendicular electric field present @xcite .",
    "the d7 action is    @xmath106    clearly this is little different from the previous case since we have an effective @xmath107 .",
    "indeed one can think of this system as a boosted version of the static case with just a @xmath4 field .",
    "however , we find it a useful case to consider in this form because we can compare the magnitude of the condensate in units of the magnetic field with varying electric field value .",
    "it is interesting to have more than one scale in the problem .",
    "one expects , since @xmath108 is the only scale in the dbi action that at small @xmath6 values @xmath109 in other words there should be a second order transition at @xmath110 with a non - mean field exponent .    above the transition the theory exhibits a singular surface where the dbi action naively turns complex",
    "this can be resolved by introducing currents induced by the electric field .",
    "the theory becomes a conductor as well as chirally symmetric .",
    "we will not be exploring this high @xmath6 phase here .",
    "we can study the theory in our wilsonian approach with a cut - off @xmath43 .",
    "the theory is equivalent to the analysis of our previous section but with @xmath4 replaced by @xmath108 .",
    "we can write the effective potential , valid close to the wilsonian transition @xmath111 where @xmath112    we can now hold @xmath43 fixed and vary @xmath6 .",
    "this potential tells us the full @xmath6 dependence of the theory near the transition point .",
    "in particular we can determine the transition point from where the mass term changes sign .",
    "@xmath113 further by writing @xmath114 and expanding we find the effective mass squared depends on @xmath6 as @xmath115 in other words the transition is mean field as one moves in @xmath6 as well as @xmath43 .",
    "in fig [ fig.ce ] we plot the condensate against @xmath6 for various choices of @xmath43 and the phase diagram in the @xmath116 plane .",
    "it is important to realize that the transition for which we have found the effective potential is that at finite positive @xmath117 and finite @xmath43 close to the transition in @xmath43 . in other words",
    "our effective theory describes the @xmath118 plot only near the @xmath35 axis .",
    "we can see that the range of validity of our effective theory is only away from the point @xmath119 ( i.e. away from @xmath110 ) @xmath120 which clearly has no extent at @xmath121 the point @xmath88 on the e axis of the @xmath118 plot is distinct with a critical exponent of @xmath122 relative to the mean - field exponent along the rest of the axis .",
    "we can not compute the form of the effective potential for the transition at @xmath88 other than in the on - shell fashion described in the previous section .",
    "the next models we will explore are the d3/d7 and the d3/d5 systems with magnetic field , to trigger chiral symmetry breaking , and density , @xmath7 , which opposes chiral symmetry breaking . the phase stucture of these theories has been explored in  @xcite for the d3/d7 system that has a second order mean field transtion with increasing density , and in  @xcite for the d3/d5 system that displays a holographic bkt transition in which the condensate grows like an exponential of @xmath123 .",
    "our goal is again to use wilsonian techniques to learn about these transitions and find the form of the effective potential responsible for the bkt transitions .",
    "this system is more complicated than the pure @xmath4 system as we shall see but we will again enforce that all flows we compare have the same ir boundary conditions at the wilsonian cut - off to give a concrete prescription . the outcome is a consistent wilsonian picture of the theories and our ability to derive the effective potential for the condensate including a potential that generates the bkt behaviour .",
    "we will concentrate first on the d3/d7 system .",
    "density is introduced into the theory through a background value for the temporal gauge field of the @xmath5 baryon number @xcite .",
    "the uv asymptotic form of the field is @xmath124 and describes the chemical potential @xmath125 and the quark density @xmath7 .",
    "the probe d7 dbi action with @xmath126 is given by @xmath127 since the action only depends on the derivative of @xmath126 there is a conserved charge density , @xmath7 , defined as @xmath128 we may legendre transform the lagrangian to write the action in terms of density @xmath129 for fixed @xmath4 and @xmath7 we can find solutions to the embedding equation of the d7 brane with uv behaviour @xmath130 .",
    "we plot example flows in fig [ fig.uv](a ) . at first sight",
    "this system seems rather different from the @xmath131 theory - solutions for a large range of @xmath33 extended all the way to @xmath41 .",
    "one can naively evaluate the action of these curves and plot it as an effective potential against @xmath33 - see fig [ fig.uv](b ) .",
    "this interpretation is though incorrect for several reasons .",
    "firstly , these flows all meet the @xmath66 axis at different angles .",
    "this means that they have different ir boundary conditions and we should not compare their action in a standard euler - lagrange context . further , since @xmath132 these branes are actually kinked at @xmath41 , when @xmath133 rotated to provide the full d7 embedding .",
    "secondly , these flows have a non - zero gauge field on their surface that should be sourced . in @xcite",
    "the authors argued that the correct source should be fundamental strings stretched between the d3 ( or the origin ) and the d7 branes .",
    "these would be explicitly the quarks corresponding to the density .",
    "such a continuous distribution of fundamental strings can be absorbed into the d7 world volume and show up as the d7 brane spiking to the origin of the space .",
    "the authors of @xcite argued in this way that only the embedding that ends at the origin was a `` good '' flow and it should represent the vacuum .",
    "this is now the standard interpretation and has provided a coherent picture across a wide range of problems including density .",
    "note that , with a naive choice of boundary condition shown in fig [ fig.uv](a ) , the vacuum flow for massless quarks is not the minimum of the potential ( fig [ fig.uv](b ) ) .",
    "this is no surprise since the other flows are not physical .    using the `` good '' flow condition one can compute the quark condensate against density at fixed @xmath4 ( fig [ fig.condensate ] ) .",
    "there is a phase transition at @xmath134 .",
    "it is second order and mean field in nature ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "our traditional analysis of the d3/d7 system with @xmath136 has again left us with no consistent supergravity flows that describe off - shell quark condensate configurations .",
    "let us try to use a wilsonian cut - off to provide a hint as to how to proceed . to make progress we will again introduce a cut - off with structure consisting of two boundaries in @xmath23 at @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "first consider the case when @xmath137 but @xmath46 is finite . for massless",
    "quarks , we shoot in from the uv , using a boundary condition of the form @xmath44 , to the cut - off @xmath46 .",
    "these configurations must be unified to a single ir boundary condition at @xmath45 .",
    "they also have a non - zero @xmath138 on their world volumes for which we must provide a source .",
    "two of the flows , the true vacuum and the flat @xmath57 embedding , have smooth extensions to @xmath137 which end at the origin .",
    "these flows describe good vacuum states of the field theory and must be included .",
    "they , therefore , dictate what our choice must be for the @xmath45 boundary condition : we must have the flows satisfying @xmath139 , so that we can correctly compare their actions .",
    "it is natural then to complete the off shell solutions with flows from @xmath139 to @xmath46 that meet the uv flows .",
    "we show such flows in fig [ fig.d7e001 ] .",
    "we can explore the phase transition with changing density at fixed magnetic field using this cut - off prescription for the deep ir . in fig [ fig.d7uvir ]",
    "we show the effective potential for a range of @xmath7 . here",
    "we take @xmath137 and @xmath140 so the cut - off is very thin .",
    "there is a second order transition as @xmath7 is raised matching the previously derived critical value of @xmath7 .",
    "close to the transition point with changing @xmath7 we can perform a fit to the form of the potential and we find @xmath141 this is a mean field potential . in fig [ fig.d7uvir ]",
    "the points are holographically derived data whilst the curves are this fit potential .",
    "the coefficients of this mean field potential is a function of @xmath142 in general , but a qualitative mean - field potential form is valid for all @xmath142 near the phase transition .",
    "now we would again like to shrink @xmath46 to @xmath45 to return to a single cut - off , which will fix our potential uniquely as a function of @xmath143 .",
    "if we do that with @xmath137 then the uv flows become those we had declared unphysical in fig [ fig.uv](a ) but with an added length of d7 extending up the @xmath66 axis from the origin .",
    "this suggests that that spike is the completion of the flows to make them physical .",
    "one can think of that spike as the fundamental strings that should source the @xmath138 gauge field on the d7 world volume .    what then is the correct way to include the spike contribution at non - zero @xmath45 ?",
    "the natural answer seems to be to maintain the condition @xmath139 at finite @xmath45 for varying @xmath46 and identifying @xmath144 .",
    "if one does so then the vacuum flow is the minimum of the potential at all @xmath43 .",
    "this picture then does not match our previous analysis of the pure @xmath4 theory - in the uv we expect to find a potential that is minimized at @xmath35 representing the uv bare theory s unbroken symmetry .",
    "we have included too much ir information with such a prescription . ] .",
    "we must enforce the same boundary condition on all the flows at @xmath45 and that condition must smoothly map to the case @xmath137 .",
    "when we remove the structured cut - off by taking @xmath145 we will again be left with a spike from the flow of fig [ fig.uv](a ) to the @xmath23 axis , but now at the scale @xmath43 as shown in fig [ fig.string ] .    in a wilsonian sense we would argue this is reasonable since the uv degrees of freedom should see all the ir physics compressed at the ir cut - off scale @xmath43 . in some sense the uv theory can not distinguish the origin from the point ( @xmath146 ) .",
    "flows of the form shown in fig [ fig.string ] will then be our cut - off prescription away from @xmath88 .",
    "the benefits of this configuration are that with a large cut - off the spike simply increases the action of non - zero @xmath33 configurations and will leave @xmath35 as the vacuum , whilst in the @xmath59 limit it will reproduce the known physical solution as the potential minimum . to compute the action of the spike",
    "we simply take a very thin limit of our two @xmath43 prescription - in particular below we will use @xmath147 .    taking this prescription we will now show that we get a sensible wilsonian story including a derivation of an appropriate effective potential for both the d3/d7 and d3/d5 systems .",
    "we first present results for the d3/d7 system . in fig",
    "[ fig : d7ed](a)-(c ) we show the effective potential as a function of @xmath33 for three choices of @xmath43 and various @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath63 is fixed . at large @xmath43 for all @xmath7",
    "we see that @xmath35 is the prefered vacuum . as @xmath43",
    "is decreased , provided @xmath148 , there is then a transition to a chiral symmetry broken phase .",
    "we show examples of values of the cut - off where this transition is first order and second order in fig [ fig : d7ed](b ) and ( c ) respectively .",
    "we can summarize the full picture by drawing the @xmath149 phase diagram which we show in fig [ fig : d7ed](d ) .",
    "note that the @xmath131 transition point matches that we found above .",
    "the @xmath88 transition point reproduces our potential fit in ( [ d7potfit ] ) .",
    "the red line is a mean - field second order transition , while the blue lie is a first order transition .",
    "the insertion of the quark spike with @xmath43 has therefore provided a believable wilsonian picture .",
    "in fact though as presented so far the ir diverges from the story we told at @xmath131 .",
    "in particular we argued that the potential should degenerate as @xmath59 as all states other than the vacuum are integrated from the low energy wilsonian theory .",
    "we simply do nt observe the embeddings that shoot in from the uv becoming complex in this system with density for embeddings with condensate values of order @xmath7 ( very large choices of @xmath33 do still go complex ) .",
    "we ve not been able to find a simple resolution .",
    "most likely the effective potential we are deriving here is equivalent to that we produced in the pure @xmath1 theory freezing and retaining the potential value at the point where the embeddings go complex - see fig [ new2](b ) .",
    "we leave this issue for future thought .      the d3/d5 system with magnetic field and density displays a ( holographic ) bkt transition  @xcite .",
    "the reason it is distinct from the d3/d7 case is that both @xmath4 and @xmath7 are dimension 2 in 2 + 1 dimension and they can be tuned against each other in the deep ir to force the embedding scalar mode of the theory to violate the breitenlohner freedman bound of the effective ir ads@xmath150 .",
    "the result is that a bkt transition occurs with an exponential growth of the order parameter ( quark condensate ) for @xmath7 below @xmath151 ( @xmath152 ) .",
    "this is discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "our goal here is to derive an effective potential for a bkt transition .",
    "the probe d5 brane is embedded in the @xmath21 and two @xmath153 directions of the d3 brane coordinates so that the quarks live on a 2 + 1 dimensional defect in the @xmath0 gauge theory @xcite .",
    "the d5 brane also extends in three directions perpendicular to the d3 brane .",
    "the probe d5 brane dbi action with @xmath126 and @xmath4 present is given by @xmath154 we may legendre transform to write the action in terms of density @xmath155 for fixed @xmath4 and @xmath7 we can find solutions to the embedding equation of the d7 brane with uv behaviour @xmath156 .    following the last section we will introduce a cut - off at the scale @xmath43 and complete the uv flows with a spike down the cut - off to the @xmath23 axis ( we again fix @xmath157 to generate the spike s action ) -",
    "see fig [ fig.string ] . we can determine the phase diagram of the theory in the @xmath149 space at fixed @xmath4 which is shown in fig [ fig : d5ed ] .",
    "the transition is first order at large @xmath43 ( the blue line ) then becomes a mean field second order transition at small @xmath43 before finally ending on a bkt transition at @xmath88 .",

    "we plot the @xmath59 potential for varying choices of @xmath7 in fig [ fig.d5uvir ] .",
    "this potential can not be well fitted by a mean field potential .",
    "instead if we fit to @xmath158 we find a good fit - see fig [ fig.d5uvir ] .",
    "the fitting potential in fig [ fig.d5uvir ] is @xmath159    this potential form implies that the condensate near the phase transition is @xmath160 note that to numerically extract this data one needs to work at extremely high accuracy near the transition where the condensate is exponentially small .",
    "the data shown are the best we have managed .",
    "in fact the form of the condensate is known analytically to be given by  @xcite @xmath161 although we have not reproduced this perfectly our numerics support this form .",
    "we consider it a considerable success to have derived the potential for the bkt transition in the holographic setting .",
    "we have analyzed the phase structure of a number of theories that break chiral symmetry and have a holographic dual using a wilsonian cut - off .",
    "including a cut - off allows us to consider off - shell states , i.e. configurations with a value of the quark condensate different from that in the true vacuum .",
    "we believe that the results give an improved intuitive understanding of the holographic description and we have been able to derive low energy effective actions for the phase transitions in these models including a potential for a bkt transition .",
    "the precise identification of our cut - offs in the holographic description and the equivalent cut - off structure in the gauge theory remains inexact but the spirit seems correct .",
    "we first studied the d3/d7 system ( the @xmath0 gauge theory with quark hypermultiplets in 3 + 1d ) .",
    "this theory has @xmath1 supersymmetry and does not generate a quark condensate .",
    "we nevertheless can in principle plot an effective potential for the condensate that should be minimized at zero . the d7 embedding encodes the quark condensate and in fig [ new1](a ) we display the euler lagrange solutions for the theory with different condensate values . in fig",
    "[ new1](b ) we insert a cut - off at a finite value of @xmath23 - here we give the cut - off some finite width and use that width to match all of the solutions to solutions of the euler lagrange equations with the same ir boundary condition at the lower cut - off . in this case as one shrinks the width of the cut - off , the uv action returns to that of just the uv flow . in fig [ new2 ]",
    "we plot the wilsonian potential , evaluated from the action of the d7 brane above the cut - off , in the theory as a function of cut - off value .",
    "the wilsonian potential is indeed minimized at zero condensate at all energy scales .",
    "there is a finite extent of the potential in the quark condensate because the embeddings become complex ( which we showed analytically in ( [ n2sol ] ) .",
    "we interpret the removal of large condensate configurations from the low energy effective actions as representing those configurations having too high energy to appear in the low energy theory .",
    "the same system with an applied magnetic field has chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "we display the euler lagrange solutions for the d7 branes with different condensate values in fig [ offshell](a ) .",
    "we introduced a cut off at finite @xmath23 as in the pure @xmath1 theory . in fig [ vvse ]",
    "we plot the resulting wilsonian potential as a function of cut - off value .",
    "the uv of the theory preserves chiral symmetry .",
    "the system then shows a second order mean field transition to the broken phase at intermediate cut - offs in the spirit of a coleman weinberg transition .",
    "the form of the potential near the transition can be extracted numerically and is displayed in ( [ v2 ] ) .",
    "finally in the deep ir non - vacuum configurations begin to be integrated out of the ir effective theory because they can not be accessed with the ir theory s energy and the effective potential again degenerates .",
    "we translated these results to the theory with a magnetic field and perpendicular electric field .",
    "this theory shares the same dbi action as the pure b theory but our results enlarge to describe the phase diagram in the electric field versus cut - off plane , which we show in fig [ fig.ce ] .",
    "we then added a constant quark density into the d3/d7 theory with magnetic field .",
    "the density opposes chiral symmetry breaking . in fig [ fig.uv ]",
    "we show the d7 embeddings for different values of the quark condensate which are again ill determined because they end at the ir axis in a kinked configuration .",
    "the true vacuum is the embedding that ends at the origin .",
    "introducing a cut - off with width as in fig [ fig.d7e001 ] allows us to define non - vacuum configurations that all end at the origin .",
    "if we take that cut - off to zero then the embeddings are completed by a spike to the origin . for a generic value of the wilsonian",
    "cut - off we have suggested that such a spike should be introduced along the cut - off as shown in fig [ fig.string ] . using this prescription we have determined",
    "the phase structure in the density , cut - off plane at fixed magnetic field , see fig [ fig : d7ed ] . here",
    "we see first order transitions with changing wilsonian scale as well as mean field cases .",
    "the ir transitions are mean field and the effective potential is of the form given in ( [ d7potfit ] ) ( in units of @xmath4 ) .",
    "finally we looked at the d3/d5 system describing the @xmath0 , 3 + 1 dimensional theory with quarks introduced on a 2 + 1 dimensional defect .",
    "here with a magnetic field and density the zero temperature theory exhibits a holographic bkt transition .",
    "we have again determined the phase diagram in the density cut - off plane at fixed magnetic field in fig [ fig : d5ed ] . as the cut - off is lowered the transition changes from first to second order before becoming a bkt transition in the deep ir .",
    "we have been able to derive an effective potential for the bkt transition in the ir given by ( [ d5fit ] ) .",
    "the wilsonian style analysis therefore allows one to see strongly coupled versions of coleman weinberg like symmetry breaking transitions .",
    "it also allows us to derive the low energy effective action in these theories by defining off - shell configurations .",
    "the effective potential for the bkt transition is a new result derived here .",
    "a number of problems remain to be analyzed in these settings including introducing finite temperature and looking at the non - mean field transitions that lie between mean field and bkt transitions @xcite .",
    "we hope to study these in the future .",
    "these methods will hopefully also be of use away from the probe limit where even simple deformations of ads are typically singular and hard to interpret @xcite .",
