    "deep understanding and smart control of quantum phase transition ( qpt ) of photons in light - matter interacting systems , one of classical phenomena in quantum world , is of fundamental importance  @xcite .",
    "qpt reveals quantum critical fluctuations at the ground state by tuning system parameters independent of temperature , which was originally introduced in condensed matter physics to investigate strongly correlated effect of electrons  @xcite .",
    "recently , qpt has attracted intensive studies in realizable photon lattices , where photons are coherently excited and transferred  @xcite .",
    "light and matter equally contribute to unravel this novel effect .",
    "hence , this greatly broadens potential applications of photons to identify quantum criticality and coherence in many - body systems .",
    "the simplest paradigm to describe photon lattices with light - matter interaction is known as jaynes - cummings - hubbard ( jch ) model , which is composed by an array of single - mode photonic cavities , with each individually coupled to two - level system , e.g. , qubit  @xcite . the competition between the intra - site qubit - cavity coupling based on rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) and inter - site photon hopping has been extensively investigated , which results in the nontrivial qpt .",
    "specifically , the mean - field theory has initially been introduced to discover the mott - insulating - to - superfluid - like phase transition of light , quantified by the excitation number of polaritons  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding phase diagram shows analogy with that in the seminal bose - hubbard model  @xcite , where mott lobes are clearly exhibited .",
    "consequently , numerical exact approaches have been employed to confirm phase boundaries  @xcite and provide critical behaviors  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the rapid progress of circuit - quantum electrodynamics and trapped ions have directly observed and consolidated this qpt  @xcite .",
    "as qubit - cavity coupling strength increases beyond weak coupling regime , the traditional jaynes - cummings description of qubit - cavity interaction becomes invalid , where the neglected counter - rotating terms ( crts ) dominates the physics  @xcite .",
    "then , the rabi - hubbard model including crts , is introduced to correctly describe the qubit - cavity coupling  @xcite .",
    "based on the analytical and numerical exact methods , the phase diagram at ground state is significantly different from the counterpart in the jch model  @xcite .",
    "it is mainly due to the fact that continuous @xmath0 symmetry in the jch model is changed to discrete @xmath1 symmetry in the rabi - hubbard model .",
    "hence , crts is considered crucial to reveal novel critical properties of the rabi - hubbard model  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the collective effect has been analyzed based on the extended jch model , termed as the rwa - dicke - hubbard model  @xcite , which describes interaction of multi - qubits with a single photonic mode at each site .",
    "it was found that increasing qubits number in each cavity has intrigued novel many - body phenomena .",
    "as is known , the dicke model was originally applied to study collective spontaneous emission atom ensembles in quantum optics  @xcite , resulting in the superradiant qpt  @xcite .",
    "hence , the question naturally arises that for the dicke - hubbard lattice , what is the influence of the interplay between the crts and collective effect on the behaviors of qpt and the corresponding phase diagram ?    this paper aims to give a comprehensive picture of dicke - hubbard model including crts",
    ". based on the mean - field theory , we generalize the extended coherent state approach self - consistently to obtain the ground state behavior of delocalized order parameter and quantify the phase transition boundary .",
    "the influence of crts on the phase diagram will be systematically analyzed , by comparing with the corresponding rwa case .",
    "moreover , the quantum fidelity is applied to detect the critical behavior of the dicke - hubbard model  @xcite .",
    "as known , quantum fidelity and the corresponding susceptibility have already been successfully to characterize qpt  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we describe the dicke - hubbard model including the crts . in sec .",
    "iii , we develop a self - consistently extended coherent state approach within the mean - field framework .",
    "the ground state energy and delocalized order parameter are obtained accordingly . in sec .",
    "iv , we discuss the localization - delocalization qpt , the corresponding phase boundaries , and the delocalization induced concurrence enhancement . finally in sec .",
    "v , we give a brief summary .",
    "in this section , we firstly describe the hamiltonian of the dicke - hubbard lattice .",
    "then , we generalize the extended coherent state approach within mean - field theory , to self - consistently solve the mean - field dicke - hubbard model .",
    "the dicke - hubbard model , describing the interplay between intra - site qubit - cavity interaction and inter - site photon hopping , is given by  @xcite @xmath2 the hamiltonian @xmath3 shows collective interaction of @xmath4 identical two - level qubits with a single mode photonic field in the @xmath5th cavity , expressed by the standard dicke model  @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the collective angular momentum operators with @xmath8 the pauli operator of two - level qubit , and @xmath9 is the energy splitting .",
    "@xmath10 creates ( annihilates ) one photon in the @xmath5th cavity , with the energy @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 is the qubit - photon coupling strength , and @xmath4 is the qubits number within each cavity .",
    "@xmath13 is the inter - site photon hopping strength between nearest - neighbor sites @xmath5 and @xmath14 , labeled by @xmath15 . in this paper",
    ", we set @xmath16 as unit for convenience .",
    "for the finite @xmath4 dicke system @xmath3 in the @xmath5th cavity , the parity operator @xmath17 can be introduced , in terms of the total excitation number @xmath18 .",
    "then , the hilbert space of @xmath3 is separated into two noninteracting subspace , due to the parity conservation as @xmath19=0 $ ] . while for the dicke - hubbard model due to the photon hopping , parity @xmath20 at local site @xmath5 appears broken .",
    "accordingly , the total system excitation number is given by @xmath21 , which results in the new parity operator @xmath22 .",
    "thus , the orthogonal subspaces are properly re - arranged .",
    "moreover , the local dicke model @xmath3 exhibits superradiant qpt in thermodynamic limit ( @xmath23 ) , at the critical qubit - cavity coupling strength @xmath24 , where the symmetry ( @xmath20 ) is broken  @xcite . below this critical strength ( @xmath25 ) , @xmath3 stays in the normal phase with microscopic excitation . on the contrary",
    ", the local dicke model shows superradiant phase as @xmath26 , where the system particle number is macroscopically excited .    in the limiting case of @xmath27 , where single qubit is embedded in each cavity ,",
    "the dicke - hubbard model is reduced to the rabi - hubbard model  @xcite , with the intra - site hamiltonian modified to @xmath28 . then , under rwa as traditionally considered , it is further changed to the jch model  @xcite , where the qubit - cavity interaction then becomes @xmath29 .",
    "it is widely known that mott - insulating - to - superfluid phase transition and mott - lobes are clearly observed in the jch model , due to the conservation of polariton number  @xcite . and",
    "the jch model is tightly related with the bose - hubbard model  @xcite . while the rabi - hubbard model exhibits quite different ground state features from the jch model , which is mainly due to crts of the qubit - cavity coupling @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to exploit the interplay of crts and collective interaction in the dicke - hubbard lattice .",
    "it should be noted that this fundamental light - matter interaction ( crts ) is reported to be able to play the role as effective chemical potential , which can stabilize the finite density of correlated photons out of vacuum in equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "we firstly introduce the mean - field theory to simplify the dicke - hubbard lattice to an effective single - site case  @xcite .",
    "the order parameter is introduced as @xmath31 with @xmath32 the ground state , to denote the qpt of photons in the dicke - hubbard model .",
    "the dicke - hubbard system is in delocalized phase of photons for non - zero @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) , and in localization phase for vanishing @xmath33 with a fixed number of particle excitations at each site .",
    "thus , the inter - site photon hopping term is decoupled as @xmath35 . and",
    "the @xmath5th site hamiltonian becomes @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the number of nearest - neighbor sites , e.g. , @xmath38 for one - dimensional array . in the present paper , we set @xmath39 for two - dimensional photonic lattice  @xcite , which actually does not affect our main results .",
    "moreover , the real order parameter is considered real @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , the reduced model becomes site independent , resulting in the effective mean - field hamiltonian @xmath41    the mean - field theory is known to be exact for infinite dimensional lattices , i.e. , @xmath42 .",
    "it has been extensively applied to study the jch model and rwa - dicke - hubbard model , which shows consistent results with the numerical exact methods  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the mean - field theory is also considered in the rabi - hubbard model , in which the results agree with those within the functional and monte carlo approaches  @xcite , even in strong @xmath13 regime .",
    "hence , we believe the mean - field theory introduced in the present paper , is applicable to correctly exploit the qpt features of the dicke - hubbard model .    for the finite - size dicke model , it is known that only small qubits size can be numerically handled within conventional fock state basis , e.g. , @xmath43  @xcite .",
    "while considering the extended coherent state approach , the ground state can be obtained accurately for large qubits size of the dicke model  @xcite .",
    "thus , we generalize the extended coherent state approach in this paper , by including the order parameter @xmath33 in a self - consistent way .",

    "generally , it is difficult to analytically obtain the eigenspectrum of the mean - field dicke - hubbard model even under rwa , due to the existence of order parameter @xmath33 .",
