    "inclusive deep inelastic lepton scattering on nucleons is a well established tool for the investigation of the quark - parton model . in the bjorken",
    "limit the cross section is proportional to a structure function which depends on only one scaling variable @xmath0 , that can be interpreted as the light - cone momentum fraction of the hit quark .",
    "deep inelastic scattering on nuclear targets showed @xcite that the @xmath0 distribution of quarks in nucleons bound in a nucleus differs from the one for a free nucleon ( emc effect ) .",
    "while part of this effect can be explained in terms of nuclear binding and fermi motion @xcite there is evidence that additional possibly non - nucleonic effects are required to obtain agreement with the data .",
    "however , since in inclusive experiments one averages over all , strongly and weakly bound nucleons , it is not possible to draw definite conclusions about the nature of these effects .",
    "more detailed information on the deep inelastic scattering process can be obtained from more exclusive experiments . here",
    "we concentrate on semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) on the deuteron in which at least one slow ( i.e. low energy ) proton is detected in coincidence with the scattered lepton .",
    "there are several reasons why this process is of interest both on a free nucleon and on nuclear targets .    on a free nucleon",
    "slow protons originate from hadronization of the spectator quarks in the struck nucleon ( so - called target fragmentation ) . in a previous study @xcite sidis on a free proton",
    "was considered , assuming factorization of the cross section into a structure function @xmath1 and a spectator quark ( debris ) fragmentation function @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the light - cone momentum fraction carried by the observed proton .",
    "it was found that the ratio @xmath4 of the sidis cross section @xmath5 and the inclusive cross section @xmath6 has a strong bias for small @xmath0 values ( in agreement with experiment ) . qualitatively this behavior can be explained by kinematics : a proton at rest in the target rest system can only be produced at @xmath7 ; on the other hand the dependence on @xmath3 and some details of @xmath0 dependence are sensitive to the shape of the fragmentation function .    on nuclear targets",
    "there are several mechanisms that can give rise to slow protons .",
    "first there is the above mentioned debris fragmentation of the quarks in the struck bound nucleon , giving rise to creation of new particles and possible change of momenta of spectator nucleons . from a comparison with the free nucleon one obtains information on the effects of the nuclear medium on the hadronization process .",
    "another category of slow protons in deep inelastic scattering on nuclei are spectator nucleons which are emitted from nucleon - nucleon correlations present in target ground state . in the special case of pure two - body correlations the l.c .",
    "momentum fraction @xmath3 of an observed spectator proton directly determines the l.c .",
    "momentum of the nucleon being struck by the lepton , @xmath8 . in this case",
    "one deals with the tagged emc effect ( originally proposed by frankfurt and strikman @xcite .",
    "this is of interest since it might help to determine whether the convolution approach to the emc effect is appropriate @xcite , or non - nucleonic degrees of freedom are required @xcite .",
    "whereas in scattering on a free nucleon the direct hadronization process is the only one possible , in nuclei both the direct and spectator processes occur and it is of interest to investigate their characteristic behavior . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the simplest possible nucleus , the deuteron .",
    "we compute the double differential cross section @xmath5 for the production of slow protons with l.c",
    ". momentum fraction @xmath3 . for the experimental data we use the result of a recent new analysis of the wa25 collaboration . in the latter",
    "a ( partial ) decomposition of the ( anti-)neutrino sidis cross section is achieved in terms of spectator , direct and rescattering events .",
    "in particular the spectator contribution can be uniquely identified by sampling the slow protons in the backward hemisphere .",
    "thus it allows one to compare the various processes separately with experimental results .",
    "another interesting feature of the deuteron target is that it provides information on the fragmentation of the neutron into a slow proton in ( anti-)neutrino induced reactions . in a pure valence quark",
    "approach the cross section for @xmath9 would vanish .",
    "in practice one must also take into account sea - quark contributions ( important at small @xmath0 ) .",
    "the latter can be treated in two ways , namely as a 4-quark fragmentation or as a bag of valence quarks surrounded by a pion cloud , which is struck by the lepton .",
    "while these models give similar results for inclusive processes there are interesting differences for exclusive reactions .",
    "for example , in the pion model one can produce slow protons in @xmath10 in two ways : via @xmath11 , and via @xmath12 with subsequent decay of the isobar into @xmath13 , whereas in the naive leading order 4-quark fragmentation only the latter process contributes to the production of slow protons    finally , in the present study we discuss possible effects of final state interactions .",
    "after hadronization of the quarks in the hit nucleon ( determined by the formation time ) the hadrons which are produced in forward direction can in general interact with the spectator nucleons and thus lead to a possible modification of their momentum distribution and charge and the creation of new particles .",
    "the possibility to study the dependence of rescattering on the formation ( hadronization ) time is of interest since it plays an essential role in the interpretation of heavy ion reactions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we summarize the sidis cross section on a free proton .",
    "the hadronization is described in terms of fragmentation functions for di - quarks and four - quarks . in section 3",
    "we discuss the direct and spectator contribution for the deuteron assuming plane wave impulse approximation and compare with experiment .",
    "the effect of rescattering on the spectator momentum distribution is estimated in the eikonal approximation and the role of the formation time is discussed .",
    "section 4 contains concluding remarks .",
    "in the bjorken limit inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) on a nucleon is characterized ( in leading order ) by one scaling variable @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the square of the four - momentum transfer and @xmath16 the nucleon momentum . in the parton model a dis event at a specific @xmath0 corresponds to the knock - out of a quark carrying a fraction @xmath17 of the nucleon light - cone momentum ( where @xmath18 and the momentum transfer @xmath19 is in the direction of @xmath3 ) . in case of neutrinos",
    "the cross section can be expressed in terms of three structure functions @xmath20 which only depend upon the quark momentum distributions .    the physical picture immediately after the ( leptonic ) scattering process is that of one quark moving with a high momentum with respect to the debris of the target ( the quark cluster ) , cf .",
    "[ fig : clusterfragmentation ] .",
    "ultimately , the quark and the cluster will interact via the strong color field , in which quark - antiquark pairs are produced , yielding color neutral objects in the final state .    in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis )",
    "one observes one or more particles in coincidence with the scattered lepton . for our purposes",
    "it is convenient to distinguish between two limiting processes , namely the production of mainly fast particles originating from the fragmentation of the struck leading quark , and the production of mainly slow hadrons coming from fragmentation of the debris . as to the leading quark fragmentation",
    "one can show @xcite that in leading order ( in @xmath21 ) the cross section can be factorized into a structure function @xmath1 which describes the dis on a quark and a probability for hadronization .",
    "the latter can be parametrized by a fragmentation function @xmath22 with the property that @xmath23 is the probability that a ` jet ' with quark - content @xmath24 yields a fragment @xmath25 carrying a fraction @xmath26 of the initial quark light - cone momentum and transverse momentum @xmath27 .",
    "the fragmentation process of the quarks left behind ( debris or target fragmentation ) is more complicated . in this case",

    "the presence of an experimental tail both in the @xmath91 and @xmath92 data which extends beyond the kinematical limit , @xmath93 , is puzzling and can not be explained .",
    "the larger tail in the proton data may be due to the absence of an unsmearing of @xmath0 in the analysis .",
    "@xcite this taken into account by an ( ad hoc ) smearing of the @xmath0 distribution . )",
    "\\(iii ) the ratio of @xmath86 for the low and high bin , which depends on the form of the fragmentation function near @xmath94 , is somewhat underestimated ; the sea contribution dominates at small @xmath0 values and is more important for the low bin than in the high bin .",
    "\\(iv ) experimentally , @xmath86 for @xmath95 and @xmath96 scattering on a neutron are quite different , and almost equal for a proton target . for the @xmath97 process",
    "the valence contribution almost vanishes , and the cross section is strongly affected by sea - quark effects ; the sea contribution is larger when using the pionic model than naive fragmentation .",
    "\\(v ) comparing the different choices for the 4q fragmentation function one sees that in @xmath98 the naive 4q fragmentation yields a larger cross section than the pion model while in @xmath99 one has the opposite situation .",
    "this is a consequence of the presence of an important charged meson exchange contribution in the pion cloud approach .",
    "\\(vi ) the unfavoured fragmentation process @xmath100 which does not have a direct contribution proceeds only via an intermediate @xmath101 after scattering on the sea - quarks in the pion cloud approach .",
    "the experimental cross section does not show such a dramatic effect .",
    "in a nuclear medium there are several processes that can give rise to slow protons .",
    "first in analogy with the dis on a free nucleon target slow protons can originate from fragmentation of the spectator quarks ( debris fragmentation ) in the struck nucleon with the other nucleons acting as spectators .",
    "this process will be referred to as the _ direct _ process .",
    "a new effect , which only occurs for @xmath102 , is the deep inelastic scattering off a bound nucleon and the observation of a spectator proton ( called the _ spectator _ process ) . since in a mean field description",
    "the @xmath103 nucleus is bound , this process provides evidence for the presence of correlations in the ground state ( for @xmath104 ) .",
    "the important point is that in the independent pair approximation neglecting the centre - of - mass motion of the pair and final state interactions one has a direct relation between the l.c .",
    "momentum fractions of the detected ( @xmath3 ) and struck ( @xmath105 ) nucleons @xmath106 .    in the following we will compute the sidis cross section on the deuteron with a slow proton present assuming that the above processes contribute incoherently .",
    "an additional process that will be considered separately is the possible reinteraction ( _ rescattering _ ) of the hadrons produced in the fragmentation with the spectator nucleon .",
    "the latter process is of interest since it depends on the hadronization in the nuclear medium , which may lead to a modification of the momentum and possibly the charge of the observed spectator nucleon .",
    "the data to be used as a comparison were obtained from an analysis of deep inelastic ( anti-)neutrino scattering experiment on the deuteron in a bubble chamber in which all ( charged ) particles were detected @xcite .",
    "the experimental data allow for a separation into ` even ' and ` odd ' events , corresponding to an even or odd number of charged hadrons in the final state , respectively . from charge conservation",
    "it follows that odd events correspond to the direct process on the neutron , where the spectator proton has insufficient momentum to become visible in the chamber . on the other hand ,",
    "the category of even events has different constituents .",
    "first , there is the direct process on the proton , leaving the neutron as an invisible spectator .",
    "second , there is the direct process on the neutron where the proton spectator is visible . and third , there are primary reactions on either a proton or a neutron with a subsequent rescattering against the other nucleon .",
    "spectator events may be individually identified when the slow proton is emitted into the backward hemisphere .",
    "the direct process on a target at rest only yields secondary protons in the forward hemisphere .",
    "( for the small contamination of direct protons , emitted backward by fermi motion , a correction is made . ) from the events with a backward spectator , events with a forward spectator may be constructed .",
    "in addition , a selection may be made of rescattering events by means of kinematical arguments .",
    "the quantity @xmath107 is evaluated , where the sum runs over all visible particles of the event . if all particles are visible and correctly identified , @xmath108 , otherwise @xmath109 . on the other hand , for rescattering events where the target is the deuteron rather than a single nucleon with mass @xmath110 , @xmath111 may become larger than 0 .",
    "a more detailed description of the experimental analysis of rescattering is found in refs .",
    "@xcite .      to compute the cross section for the direct process we use a convolution model @xcite , in which the fermi motion and binding are taken into account by folding the semi - inclusive structure functions for a free nucleon with the momentum distribution of the nucleon in the nucleus . in this",
    "approach off - shell effects and possible final state interactions between the quarks in the struck nucleon and the spectator nucleons are neglected .    when using the fragmentation approach for the scattering off valence and sea quarks the cross section can be expressed as an integral over the light - cone momentum fraction carried by the nucleon ( cf .",

    "( [ eq : fsidis2 ] ) and ( [ eq : fsidis3 ] ) and the generalized convolution function is given by @xcite @xmath113 after integration over the transverse momentum one recovers the usual convolution function for the light - cone momentum @xcite @xmath114 where @xmath115 .",
    "the factor @xmath105 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : convfuncpt ] ) which comes from the convolution of the hadronic tensor , is usually referred to as the flux factor .",
    "alternatively one can convolute the semi - inclusive cross section ; in this case the factor @xmath105 arises from the presence of the invariant mass of the neutrino plus nucleon system in the convolution integral ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in the present work the momentum density @xmath116",
    "is taken from ref .",
    "@xcite ( bonn potential ) . for the deuteron",
    "the convolution function @xmath117 is sharply peaked at @xmath118 , corresponding to a nucleon at rest , and falls of rapidly for @xmath119 and as a result the cross section for the direct process differs very little from the one for the free nucleon case .",
    "the main difference is that , due to the fermi - motion , the calculated cross section extends to larger values of @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , the number of protons produced in the backward direction with a momentum above the experimental cutoff of @xmath120 is negligible .    as noted above it",
    "is possible to compare the results for the direct cross section on the neutron with the data set for odd events , to which the even events with a backward and a constructed forward spectator are added .",
    "the calculated @xmath86 as a function of @xmath0 for the free neutron ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : neutronvsexp ] ) and those for the bound neutron ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : oddvsmodel ] ) differ slightly both in the value of the cut - off in @xmath0 ( due to the fermi motion in the deuteron ) and in normalization ( due to the different inclusive cross sections for @xmath121 and @xmath65 ) . again",
    "the smaller sidis cross section for the @xmath96 case can be explained by the presence of the unfavoured fragmentation function .      in the absence of final state interactions the cross section for the spectator process",
    "is given by ( cf .",
    "[ fig : semdisprocess]b ) @xmath122    hence the dependence of cross section on @xmath3 ( when integrated over @xmath27 ) is determined by the light - cone momentum fraction of the neutron in the deuteron ( approximately symmetric around @xmath94 ) and the corresponding shift in the arguments of the structure functions ( which is asymmetric around @xmath94 ) .",

    "the difference in @xmath0 dependence between neutrinos and anti - neutrinos can be attributed to the difference of the @xmath0 distributions between the @xmath126 and @xmath127 quarks in the proton and the neutron : spectator protons correspond to events where the @xmath128 scatters off a @xmath129 quark in the neutron whereas the inclusive deuteron cross section involves an average over proton and neutron events .    also of interest is the ratio @xmath130 obtained by integrating the semi - inclusive cross section over the transverse momentum and @xmath0 , and dividing by the inclusive cross section @xmath131 fig .",

    "first as shown in @xcite the inclusive rescattering probability ( which experimentally can be identified with the help of the variable @xmath111 ) is sensitive to the time ( length ) scale in the hadronization process .",
    "a second topic of interest is the modification of the spectator l.c .",
    "momentum distribution .",
    "the deuteron is the simplest nuclear system where the hadronization process in a medium can be studied , and the nuclear structure can be treated without approximation .",
    "below we discuss the consequences of final state interactions ( rescattering ) for both the spectator spectrum and the rescattering probability .      the simplest approach to rescattering",
    "is to assume that the hit nucleon hadronizes instantaneously into a number of color singlets which can rescatter incoherently on the spectator .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that in this independent rescattering model the observed rescattering fraction @xmath133 ( the number of rescatter events over the total number of events ) is grossly overestimated .",
    "in the eikonal approximation the incoherent rescattering probability is@xcite : @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the fragment - spectator cross section and @xmath136 is the multiplicity .",

    "this agrees with the average experimental value .",

    "this strongly indicates that the present approach is too simple : we have neglected all interactions of the string ( excited nucleon ) before hadronization and assumed that only one fragment will rescatter .",
    "any interaction of the string will however , increase the rescattering probability and smoothen the @xmath0-dependence .",

    "there are several ways to study whether this simple picture is affected by fsi .",
    "a simple criterium is the ratio of @xmath0 values for events with and without a slow backward proton , @xmath151 , which in the case of spectator events is proportional to @xmath152 . in case of @xmath153ne this relation",
    "has been confirmed qualitatively for events containing only one slow proton@xcite .    the most obvious contribution to the rescattering process , that gives rise to slow protons ,",

    "using this distribution we can write the modified backward proton spectrum as as a sum of rescattered and undistorted spectators @xmath155 where @xmath156 is the cross section for spectators , that are unaffected by rescattering , and @xmath157 the spectrum of protons that arises from the rescattering process .    as a first estimate of the effect of rescattering we calculated the distorted spectator distribution ( including only elastic rescattering ) . for the cross section we used the parametrization from ref .",
    "@xcite for all types of fragments ( including resonances and mesons ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rescatteredspectators ] we plot the spectrum of backward protons @xmath158 as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "it is seen that , as one expects , the spectrum is shifted towards the forward hemisphere ( @xmath159 ) . however , because of the rather small effect , and the number of approximations in the calculation it is not possible to make a quantitative comparison with the ( anti-)neutrino data .",
    "motivated by a reanalysis of experimental data we have investigated the absolute cross section for semi - inclusive deep inelastic charged current ( anti ) neutrino scattering on hydrogen and deuterium with the observation of a slow proton in the final state , as a function of the bjorken @xmath0 and the light - cone momentum fraction @xmath3 .    on a free nucleon",
    ", we assume that the cross section can be factorized into a quark momentum distribution and a fragmentation function for the spectator quarks . at small values of @xmath0",
    "the cross section is dominated by sea - quark effects ; the latter can be simulated by a pion cloud model , and by a four - quark fragmentation function .",
    "the strong bias of the ratio @xmath4 of the coincidence cross section and the inclusive cross section for small @xmath0 values has basically a kinematic origin .",
    "the deuteron target offers several new interesting effects .",
    "first , the data analysis makes it possible to isolate deep inelastic scattering on the neutron with subsequent fragmentation into a proton .",
    "second , there is an additional source of slow protons in the final state , namely the emitted spectator nucleon . in the backward hemisphere where this process dominates",
    ", the cross section is directly proportional to the light - cone momentum distribution of the nucleons . in most cases",
    "qualitative agreement with the data is obtained ; a more quantitative comparison can only be made using higher accuracy data .",
    "finally , an analysis of rescattering events indicates that the naive incoherent rescattering of produced hadrons is not consistent with experiment .",
    "there are several reasons why it is interesting to extend the present study to heavier nuclei . in the plane wave impulse approximation",
    "the spectator momentum distribution depends sensitively on details of the nuclear spectral function @xmath160 .",
    "in addition one expects to obtain more information about final state interactions between spectator nucleons and produced hadrons , in which the formation time plays a crucial role .",
