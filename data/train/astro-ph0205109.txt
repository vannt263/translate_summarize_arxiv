    "the goal of observing neutrinos of astrophysical origin determines the design and the size of neutrino telescopes .",

    "the amanda detector uses the 2.8 km thick ice sheet at the south pole as a neutrino target , cherenkov medium and cosmic ray flux attenuator .",
    "the detector consists of vertical strings of optical modules ( oms )  photomultiplier tubes sealed in glass pressure vessels  frozen into the ice at depths of 15002000 m below the surface .",
    "figure  [ fig : eiffel ] shows the current configuration of the amanda detector .",
    "the shallow array , amanda - a , was deployed at depths of 800 to 1000 m in 199394 in an exploratory phase of the project .",
    "studies of the optical properties of the ice carried out with amanda - a showed a high concentration of air bubbles at these depths , leading to strong scattering of light and making accurate track reconstruction impossible .",
    "therefore , a deeper array of ten strings with 302 oms was deployed in the austral summers of 199596 and 199697 at depths of 15002000 m .",
    "this detector is referred to as amanda - b10 , and is shown in the center of fig .",
    "[ fig : eiffel ] .",
    "the detector was augmented by three additional strings in 199798 and six in 19992000 , forming the amanda - ii array .",

    ", width=321 ]    the optical properties of the polar ice in which amanda is embedded have been studied in detail , using both light emitters located on the strings and the downgoing muon flux itself .",
    "these studies  @xcite have shown that the ice is not perfectly homogeneous , but rather that it can be divided into several horizontal layers which were laid down by varying climatological conditions in the past  @xcite .",
    "different concentrations of dust in these layers lead to a modulation of the scattering and absorption lengths of light in the ice , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : layers ] .",
    "the average absorption length is about 110 m at a wavelength of 400 nm at the depth of the amanda - b10 array , and the average effective scattering length is approximately 20 m .",
    "the data analyzed in this paper were recorded during the austral winter of 1997 , from april to november .",
    "subtracting downtime for detector maintenance , removing runs in which the detector behaved abnormally and correcting for deadtime in the data acquisition system , the effective livetime was 130.1 days .",
    "triggering was done via a majority logic system , which demanded that 16 or more oms report signals within a sliding window of 2@xmath4s . when this condition was met , a trigger veto was imposed and the entire array read out .",
    "the raw trigger rate of the array was on average 75hz , producing a total data set of @xmath5 events .",
    "random noise was observed at a rate of 300hz for oms on the inner four strings and 1.5 khz for tubes on the outer six , the difference being due to different levels of concentration of radioactive potassium in the pressure vessels ( details on noise rates can be found in ref  @xcite ) .",
    "a typical event has a duration of 4.5 @xmath4s , including the muon transit time and the light diffusion times , so random noise contributed on average one pmt signal per event .",
    "almost all of the events recorded were produced by downgoing muons originating in cosmic ray showers .",
    "triggers from atmospheric neutrinos contribute only a few tens of events per day , a rate small compared to the event rate from cosmic ray muons , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : trig_zenith ] .",
    "the main task of amanda data analysis is to seperate these neutrino events from the background of cosmic - ray muons .",
    "monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of the detector response to muons produced by neutrinos or by cosmic rays were undertaken to develop techniques of background rejection .",
    "downgoing muons were generated by atmospheric shower simulations of isotropic protons with basiev  @xcite or protons and heavier nuclei with corsika using the qgsjet generator  @xcite , and tracked to the detector with the muon propagation code mudedx @xcite .",
    "two other muon propagation codes were used to check for systematic differences : propmu  @xcite with a 30% lower rate and mmc  @xcite with a slightly higher rate .",
    "a total of @xmath6 events were simulated .",
    "most characteristics of the events generated with basiev were found to be similar to the more accurate corsika - based simulation .",
    "for the latter , the primary cosmic ray flux as described by wiebel - sooth and biermann  @xcite was used .",
    "the curvature of the earth has been implemented in corsika to correctly describe the muon flux at large zenith angles .",
    "the event rate based on this monte carlo was 75hz and compares reasonably well with the observed rate of 100hz ( after deadtime correction ) .",
    "the detector response to muons was modeled by calculating the photon fields produced by continuous and stochastic muonic energy losses  @xcite , and simulating the response of the hardware to these photons  @xcite .",
    "upgoing muons were generated by a propagation of atmospheric neutrinos , which were tracked through the earth and allowed to interact in the ice in or around the detector or in the bedrock below  @xcite .",
    "muons that were generated in the bedrock were propagated using propmu  @xcite until they reached the rock - ice boundary at the depth of 2800 m .",
    "the muons were then propagated through the ice in the same way as those from cosmic ray showers .",
    "the atmospheric neutrino flux was taken from lipari  @xcite .",
    "the cherenkov photon propagation through the ice was modeled to create multidimensional tables of density and arrival time probability distributions of the photon flux .",
    "these photon fields were calculated for pure muon tracks and for cascades of charged particles .",
    "a real muon track was modeled as a superposition of the photon fields of a pure muon track and the stochastic energy losses based on cascades .",
    "the photon fields were calculated out to 400 m from the emission point , taking into account the orientation of the om with respect to the muon or cascade . in the detector simulation ,",
    "the ice was modeled as 16 discrete layers , as indicated by the shaded areas in fig .",
    "[ fig : layers ] .",
    "the spectral properties of the photomultiplier sensitivity , the glass , the gel , and , most importantly , the ice itself were included in the simulation of the photon propagation .",
    "the probability of photon detection depends on the fresnel reflectance at all interfaces , transmittances of various parts , and quantum and collection efficiencies of the pmt .",
    "the relevant physical parameters have been measured in the laboratory , so that the spectral sensitivity of the om could be evaluated .",
    "two types of oms , differing in the type of pressure vessel , were used in the construction of amanda - b10 . the inner four strings ( amanda - b4 ) use billings housings while the outer six strings use benthos housings .",
    "( benthos inc . and billings industries are the manufacturers of the glass pressure vessels .",
    "benthos and billings are registered trademarks of the respective companies . ) the two types of housing have different optical properties .",
    "the benthos oms have an effective quantum efficiency of 21% at a wavelength of 395 nm for plane - wave photons incident normal to the pmt photocathode . ninety percent of the detected photons are in the spectral range of 345560 nm .",
    "an additional sensitivity effect arises from the ice surrounding the oms .",
    "the deployment of oms requires melting and refreezing of columns of ice , called `` hole ice '' hereafter .",
    "this cycle results in the formation of bubbles in the vicinity of the modules , which increase scattering and affects the sensitivity of the optical modules in ways that are not understood in detail . since the total volume of hole ice is small compared to bulk ice in the detector ( columns of 60 cm diameter , compared to 30 m spacing between strings ) , its effect on optical properties can be treated as a correction to the om angular sensitivity .",
    "the increased scattering of photons in the hole ice has been simulated and compared to data taken with laser measurements _ in situ _ to assess the magnitude of this effect .",
    "this comparison provides an om sensitivity correction that reduces the relative efficiency in the forward direction , but enhances it in the sideways and backward directions .",
    "the sensitivity in the backward hemisphere ( @xmath7 ) relative to the sensitivity integrated over all angles ( @xmath8 ) of the optical sensor increases from 20% to 27% , due to this correction , while the average relative sensitivity in the forward direction ( @xmath9 ) drops from 80% to 73% .",
    "in other words , an om becomes a somewhat more isotropic sensor .",
    "the effective angular sensitivity of the oms was also assessed using the flux of downgoing atmospheric muons as a test beam illuminating both the 295 downward facing oms and the 7 upward facing oms . we assumed that the response of the upward facing oms to light from downward muons is equivalent to the response of the downward facing oms to light from upward moving muons . based on this assumption",
    "we derived a modified angular response function ( later referred to as angsens ) , which resulted in a effective reduction of the absolute om sensitivity in forward direction . in this model",
    "the effective relative sensitivity is 67% in the forward hemisphere , and 33% in the backward hemisphere .",
    "this correction will be used to estimate the effect of systematic uncertainties in the angular response on the final neutrino analysis .",
    "the simulation of the hardware response included the modeling of gains and thresholds and random noise at the levels measured for each om .",
    "the transit times of the cables and the shapes of the photomultiplier pulses , ranging from 170 to 360ns fwhm , were included in the trigger simulation .",
    "multi - photon pulses were simulated as superimposed single photoelectron waveforms . in all , some @xmath10 seconds of cosmic rays were simulated , corresponding to 7% of the events contained in the 1997 data set .",
    "the reconstruction of muon events in amanda is done offline , in several stages .",
    "first , the data are `` cleaned '' by removing unstable pmts and spurious pmt signals ( or `` hits '' ) due to electronic or pmt noise .",
    "the cleaned events are then passed through a fast filtering algorithm , which reduces the background of downgoing muons by one order of magnitude .",
    "this reduction allows the application of more sophisticated reconstruction algorithms to the remaining data set .    because of the complexity of the task , and in order to increase the robustness of the results , two separate analyses of the 1997 data set were undertaken .",
    "both proceeded along the general lines described above , but differ in the details of implementation .",
    "the preliminary stages , which are very similar in both analyses , are described here .",
    "the particulars of each analysis will be described in sections [ sec : desy ] and [ sec : uw ] .",
    "a more detailed description of the reconstruction procedure will be published elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the first step in reconstructing events is to clean and calibrate the data recorded by the detector .",
    "unstable channels ( oms ) are identified and removed on a run - to - run basis . on average ,",
    "260 of the 302 oms deployed are used in the analyses .",
    "the recorded times of the hits are corrected for delays in the cables leading from the oms to the surface electronics and for the amplitude - dependent time required for a pulse to cross the discriminator threshold .",
    "hits are removed from the event if they are identified as being due to instrumental noise , either by their low amplitudes or short pulse lengths , or because they are isolated in space by more than 80 m and time by more than 500ns from the other hits recorded in the event .",
    "pulses with short duration , measured as the time over threshold ( tot ) , are often related to electronic cross - talk in the signal cables or the surface electronics . in analysis",
    "ii , tot cuts are applied to individual channels beyond the standard cleaning common to both analyses ( see section [ sec : uw ] ) .    following the cleaning and the calibration ,",
    "a `` line fit '' is calculated for each event .",
    "this fit is a simple @xmath11 minimization of the apparent photon flux direction , for which an analytic solution can be calculated quickly  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "it contains no details of cherenkov radiation or propagation of light in the ice .",
    "hits arriving at time @xmath12 at pmt @xmath13 located at @xmath14 are projected onto a line .",
    "the minimization of @xmath15 gives a solution for @xmath16 and a velocity @xmath17 .",
    "the results of this fit  at the first stage the direction @xmath18 , at later stages the absolute value of the velocity  are used to filter the data set .",
    "approximately 8090% of the data , for which the line fit solution is steeply downgoing , are rejected at this stage .",
    "after the data have been passed through the fast filter , tracks are reconstructed using a maximum likelihood method .",
    "the observed photon arrival times do not follow a simple gaussian distribution attributable to electronic jitter ; instead , a tail of delayed photons is observed .",
    "the photons can be delayed predominantly by scattering in the ice that causes them to travel on paths longer than the length of the straight line inclined at the cherenkov angle to the track . also , photons emitted by scattered secondary electrons generated along the track will have emission angles other than the muon cherenkov angle .",
    "these effects generate a distribution of arrival times with a long tail of delayed photons .",
    "we construct a probability distribution function describing the expected distribution of arrival times , and calculate the likelihood @xmath19 of a given reconstruction hypothesis as the product of the probabilities of the observed arrival times in each hit om : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the time residual ( the delay of the observed hit time relative to that expected for unscattered propagation of cherenkov photons emitted by the muon ) , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the distance of the om from the track and the orientation of the module with respect to the track .",
    "the probability distribution function @xmath24 includes the effects of scattering and absorption in the bulk ice and in the refrozen ice around the modules .",
    "the functional form of @xmath24 is based on a solution to a transport equation of the photon flux from a monochromatic point source in a scattering medium  @xcite .",
    "the free parameters of this function are then fit to the expected time profiles that are obtained by a simulation of the photon propagation from muons in the ice  @xcite . varying the track parameters of the reconstruction hypothesis",
    ", we find the maximum of the likelihood function , corresponding to the best track fit for the event .",
    "the result of the fit is described by five parameters : three ( @xmath25 ) to determine a reference point , and two ( @xmath26 ) for the zenith and azimuth of the track direction .",
    "figure [ fig : event_display ] shows an event display of two upgoing muon events together with the reconstructed tracks .",
    "the set of apparently upgoing tracks provided by the reconstruction procedure exceeds the expected number of upgoing tracks from atmospheric neutrino interactions by one to three orders of magnitude , depending on the details of the reconstruction algorithm ( see sections [ sec : desy ] and [ sec : uw ] ) . in order to reject the large number of `` fake events ''  events generated by a downgoing muon or cascade , but seemingly having an upgoing structure",
    " we impose additional requirements on the reconstructed events to obtain a relatively pure neutrino sample .",
    "these requirements consist of cuts on observables derived from the reconstruction and on topological event parameters .",
    "below , we describe the most relevant of the parameters used .      in analogy to a reduced @xmath11 , we define a reduced likelihood @xmath28 where @xmath29 , the number of recorded hits in the event less the five track fit parameters , is the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "a smaller @xmath27 corresponds to a higher quality of the fit .",
    "the number of direct hits is defined as the number of hits with time delays @xmath31 smaller than a certain value .",
    "we use time intervals of and , and denote the corresponding parameters as @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "the negative extent of the window allows for jitter in pmt rise times and for small errors in geometry and calibration , while the positive side includes these effects as well as delays due to scattering of the photons .",
    "events with many direct hits ( i.e. , only slightly delayed photons ) are likely to be well reconstructed .",
    "the track length is defined by projecting each of the direct hits onto the reconstructed track , and measuring the distance between the first and the last hit .",
    "a cut on this parameter rejects events with a small lever arm for the reconstruction .",
    "direct hits with time residuals of are used for the measurement of the track length .",
    "cuts on the absolute length , as well as zenith angle dependent cuts ( which take into account the cylindrical shape of the detector ) have been used .",
    "the requirement of a minimum track length corresponds to imposing a muon energy threshold .",
    "for example , a track length of 100 m translates into a muon energy threshold of about 25 gev .",
    "the `` smoothness '' parameter is a check on the self - consistency of the fitted track .",
    "it measures the constancy of light output along the track .",
    "highly variable apparent emission of light usually indicates that the track either has been completely misreconstructed or that an underlaying muonic cherenkov light was obscured by a very bright stochastic light emission , which usually leads to poor reconstruction .",
    "the smoothness parameter was inspired by the kolmogorov - smirnov test of the consistency of two distributions ; in our case the consistency of the observed hit pattern with the hypothesis of constant light emission by a muon .",
    "figure [ fig : event_display2 ] shows two events to illustrate the characteristics of the smoothness parameter .",
    "one event is a long uniform track , which was well reconstructed .",
    "the other event is a background event which displays a very poor smoothness .",

    "for a long , cylindrical distribution of hit modules , two moments will be much larger than the third .",
    "we can reject spherical events , such as those produced by muon bremsstrahlung , by requiring that the normalized magnitude of the smallest moment , @xmath45 , be small .",
    "the two analyses of the data diverge after the filtering stage , following different approaches to event reconstruction and background rejection .",
    "analysis i uses an improved likelihood function based on a more detailed description of the photon response  @xcite , followed by a set of stepwise tightened cuts .",
    "analysis ii uses a bayesian reconstruction  @xcite in which the likelihood is multiplied by a zenith angle dependent prior function , resulting in a strong rejection of downgoing background .",
    "rare backgrounds due to unsimulated instrumental effects , such as cross - talk between signal channels and unstable voltage supply , were identified in the course of the analyses .",
    "these effects either produced spurious triggers , or , more often , spurious hits that caused the event to be misreconstructed .",
    "different but comparably efficient techniques were developed to treat these backgrounds . in analysis",
    "i the event topology is inspected ; if the spatial pattern of hit oms is inconsistent with the reconstructed muon trajectory , the event is rejected .",
    "analysis ii attempts to remove the anomalous hits or triggers through identification of characteristic correlations in signal amplitudes and times , which considerably reduces the rate of these misreconstructions .    at this stage",
    "the data set in each analysis is reduced to several thousand events out of the original @xmath46 , but the data are still background dominated .",

    "are tightened until the remaining background disappears .",

    "the twisted pair cables were found to be more susceptible to cross - talk signals .",
    "note that variations in the optical parameters of the ice due to past climatological episodes also produce some vertical structure .",
    "we developed additional cog cuts on the topology of the events in order to remove these backgrounds .",

    "the shape of the distribution of data is statistically consistent with the prediction from atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "figure  [ fig : cogzfinal ] ( bottom ) shows the distribution of the @xmath52 parameter for the 204 events .",
    "the level 7 quality cuts have removed the remainder of the instrumental events left after the bayesian reconstruction with the improved cross - talk cleaning algorithm , bringing the data events in line with the atmospheric neutrino expectations .",
    "the efficiencies corresponding to the three steps of the data analysis : 1 ) events reconstructed upward , 2 ) events reconstructed upward with cross - talk cleaning , and 3 ) with additional level 7 quality cuts are summarized in table [ table1 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : nminus1plots ] ( top ) shows the smoothness distribution for events that have passed the quality level 7 cuts for the five observables except smoothness .",
    "the vertical dashed line at smoothness @xmath68 shows the value of the level 7 smoothness cut .",
    "this cut removes the tail of fake events leaving a good agreement between remaining data and monte carlo .",
    "figure  [ fig : nminus1plots ] ( bottom ) shows the same plot for the direct length variable .",
    "again , a clear tail of fake events is removed by requiring a direct length of greater than 70 meters .",
    "as a novel instrument , amanda poses a unique challenge of calibration .",
    "there are no known natural sources of high energy neutrinos , apart from atmospheric neutrinos , whose observation could be used to measure the detector s response . understanding the behavior of the detector is thus a difficult task , dependent partly on laboratory measurements of the individual components , partly on observations of artificial light sources embedded in the ice , and partly on observations of downgoing muons . even with these measurements , uncertainties in various properties that systematically affect the response of",
    "the detector persist , which prevent us at this time from making a precise measurement of the atmospheric neutrino flux .",
    "the primary sources of systematic uncertainties , and their approximate effects on the number of upgoing atmospheric neutrinos in the final data sample , as determined by variation of the simulations , are listed below .",
    "as discusssed in sections 2 and 3 , amanda is embedded in a natural medium , which is the result of millennia of climatological history , that has left its mark in the form of layers of particulate matter affecting the optical properties of the ice .",
    "furthermore , the deployment of optical modules requires the melting and refreezing of columns of the ice .",
    "this cycle results in the formation of bubbles in the vicinity of the modules , which increase scattering and affect the sensitivity of the optical modules in ways that are not yet fully understood .",
    "the effects of this local hole ice are difficult to separate from the intrinsic sensitivity of the oms .",
    "the uncertainties in the neutrino rate are approximately 15% from the bulk ice layer modeling in the monte carlo , and as much as 50% from the combined effects of the properties of the refrozen hole ice close to the oms , and the intrinsic om sensitivity , and angular response .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    figure  [ fig : linefit ] shows two variables that are sensitive to the absolute om sensitivity : the number of oms hit and the velocity of the line fit .",
    "the systematic effects of varying om sensitivity on the hit multiplicity for analysis  i are shown on the top .",
    "the peak of the multiplicity distribution for the standard monte carlo ( nominal efficiency 100%  dashed line ) lies at a higher value than for the data . reducing the simulated om sensitivity by 50% results in a peak at lower values than the data .",
    "the other variable strongly affected by the om sensitivity  the velocity of the line fit , introduced in section [ sec : clean_filter ] )  is the apparent velocity of the observed light front traveling through the ice , see fig .",
    "[ fig : linefit ] ( bottom ) .    as a next step ,",
    "we investigated the effect of the angsens om model ( first introduced in section 3 ) on the atmospheric neutrino monte carlo simulation .",
    "the results of this simulation gave a more consistent description of the experiment for several variables  e.g. , the hit multiplicity ( the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : linefit ] )  and they produced the absolute neutrino event prediction closer to what was found in analysis  i ( 236.9 events predicted , 223 observed ) .",
    "similar effects are seen when this monte carlo is used with analysis  ii , however the number of predicted events is 25% smaller than observed .",
    "thus the angsens model , while encouraging , does not completely predict the properties of observed events in both analyses .",
    "another uncertainty lies in the monte carlo routines used to propagate muons through the ice and rock surrounding the detector .",
    "a comparison of codes based on @xcite and  @xcite indicates that different propagators may change the event rates by some 25% .    -0.5",
    "cm     other factors include the simulation of the data acquisition electronics and possible errors in the time calibrations of individual modules .",
    "these effects have been studied by systematically varying relevant parameters in the monte carlo simulations . for realistic levels of variation ,",
    "these effects are well below the 10% level .",
    "figure  [ fig : sys_zenith ] demonstrates how the zenith angle distribution depends on different atmospheric neutrino event generators ( our standard generator nusim  @xcite and another generator nu2mu",
    "@xcite ) , and also on the chosen angular sensitivity of the optical module .",
    "neutrino flavor oscillations lead to a further reduction of the angsens prediction by 5.4% ( in particular , close to the vertical direction ) , assuming @xmath70 and @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "the prediction is reduced by 11% if the largest allowed @xmath72 is used .",
    "the combined effect of all these systematic uncertainties is sufficiently large that simulations of a given atmospheric neutrino flux can produce predictions for the event rate varying by a factor of two .",
    "by contrast , the estimated theoretical uncertainty in the atmospheric neutrino flux , at the energies probed by these analyses , is 30%  @xcite .",
    "the effect of neutrino oscillations with the super - k preferred parameters would be less than 10% at these energies .",
    "both analyses  i and  ii are able to separate more than 200 neutrino event candidates from the 130.1 days of amanda - b10 detector livetime in 1997 . based on atmospheric neutrino simulations we find that about 4% of the total number of events triggered by upward moving neutrinos passed the final selection .",
    "a total deficit in the event rate of about 35% with respect to the standard neutrino monte carlo prediction is found for both analyses .",
    "an event overlap of 102 experimental events is observed , consistent with a predicted overlap of @xmath73 from the atmospheric neutrino monte carlo .",
    "thus , the combined sample of data provides about 300 neutrino candidates .",
    "both analyses estimate their residual background to be about 10% of the number of neutrino event candidates .",
    "figure  [ fig : eneff ] shows the energy distribution of the simulated neutrinos and the corresponding muon events .",
    "ninety percent of all monte carlo signal events have muon ( neutrino ) energies between 48 ( 66 ) gev and 1.8  ( 3.4 )  tev .",
    "the dominant part of the signal events in this analysis comes from neutrino energies below 1  tev .",
    "figure  [ fig : effarea ] shows the effective area as a function of the zenith angle for two ranges of the muon energy at the point of closest ( poc ) approach to the detector .",
    "the effective area for muons with energies at poc between 100 and 1000gev is @xmath74m@xmath75 at trigger level and @xmath76m@xmath75 after application of the neutrino selection cuts .",
    "it should be noted that much higher effective areas are possible when searching for neutrinos from astrophysical point sources @xcite or from gamma ray bursts @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : angres ] shows the point spread function of the reconstructed muon trajectory with respect to the true muon direction . based on monte carlo simulations ,",
    "we find a median angular resolution of muons from atmospheric neutrinos of @xmath77 for the final sample .",
    "a more detailed study of the angular resolution can be found in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : sky ] shows the skyplot ( equatorial coordinates ) of all the candidate neutrino events found across both analyses .",
    "the distribution of the events on the skyplot is consistent with a random distribution .    .",
    "the amanda - b10 data from 130.1 days of livetime during the austral winter of 1997 have been analyzed in an effort to detect high energy atmospheric neutrino events , and to compare their properties to expectations .",
    "two working groups in the collaboration , using differing reconstruction , cut optimization and instrumental event rejection techniques , produced sets of 223 and 204 neutrino candidates , respectively .",
    "several methods of background estimation put the residual event contamination from downgoing atmospheric muons and instrumental artifacts at about 10% .",
    "taking into account systematic uncertainties , the observed event numbers are consistent with systematically varied atmospheric neutrino monte carlo predictions , which are from 150400 events .",
    "the range of these predictions is dominated by uncertainties in the neutrino flux , in the understanding of photon propagation through the bulk ice and the refrozen hole ice , and in muon propagation and energy loss .",
    "the monte carlo suggests that 90% of the selected events are produced by neutrinos in the energy range of @xmath78gev to @xmath3tev .",
    "the observation of atmospheric neutrinos in line with expectations establishes amanda - b10 as a working neutrino telescope .",
    "we finally note that many of the procedures for signal separation simplify considerably in larger detectors .",
    "in particular , first results from amanda - ii @xcite demonstrate that the neutrino signal is separated with much higher efficiency and with fewer cuts than for amanda - b10 .",
