    "the hemodynamic response is generally charachterized through an extension of the so - called balloon - windkessel model , @xcite , a siso dynamic system with the neural activity @xmath15 , i.e. the component of @xmath16 in position @xmath17 , as input and the corresponding observed bold signal @xmath18 as output .",

    "typically , a stability - inducing prior is formulated for the matrix @xmath53 , while empirical priors are assigned to the hemodynamic parameters @xmath57 .",

    "a variational bayes scheme is used , under the mean - field and the laplace assumptions : namely , the approximated marginal posterior distributions are considered independent and gaussian ( see @xcite for details ) . +",
    "a second family of approaches still parametrizes the distribution of the process and observation noises in , but operates in the time - domain , thus estimating not only the model parameters @xmath38 but also the hidden neuronal states @xmath58 .",
    "the most common methods are dynamic expectation maximization ( dem ) @xcite and generalized filtering ( gf ) @xcite : even if both adopt the variational bayes procedure , dem uses the mean - field and the laplace approximations , while gf only exploits the latter .",

    "<S> contemporary neuroscience has embraced network science to study the complex and self - organized structure of the human brain ; one of the main outstanding issues is that of inferring from measure data , chiefly functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fmri ) , the so - called effective connectivity in brain networks , that is the existing interactions among neuronal populations . </S>",
    "<S> this inverse problem is complicated by the fact that the bold ( blood oxygenation level dependent ) signal measured by fmri represent a dynamic and nonlinear transformation ( the hemodynamic response ) of neuronal activity . in this paper , we consider resting state ( rs ) fmri data ; building upon a linear population model of the bold signal and a stochastic linear dcm model , the model parameters are estimated through an em - type iterative procedure , which alternately estimates the neuronal activity by means of the rauch - tung - striebel ( rts ) smoother , updates the connections among neuronal states and refines the parameters of the hemodynamic model ; sparsity in the interconnection structure is favoured using an iteratively reweighting scheme .    </S>",
    "<S> experimental results using rs - fmri data are shown demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach and comparison with state of the art routines ( spm12 toolbox ) is provided . </S>"
