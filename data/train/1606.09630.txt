    "we now discuss a subtle , but important issue related to the existence of a reachable stable point in the multi - dimensional glv dynamics . indeed , depending on the parametrization of the adjacency matrix @xmath8 , eq .",

    "@xcite , we can achieve this goal .",
    "if the off - diagonal elements of @xmath8 are given by a distribution with mean @xmath57 , standard deviation @xmath58 and correlation coefficient @xmath59 and the diagonal elements are all fixed to a constant ( @xmath61 ) , we could set @xmath62 so that the analytic solution of the multi - dimensional glv dynamics is stable and feasible ( see appendix [ app : stabilitycriteria ] ) . for @xmath63 ,",

    "stable glv dynamics are assured if @xmath67 , that is @xmath62 of order @xmath36 ( rows 8 - 10 in table [ tab : results ] ) .",
    "note that for the case of a constant diagonal close to the critical value , shown in figure [ fig : error_glv_panel ] ( d ) , the theoretical value is not expected to give a good approximation to the empirical average , since in this case , the expected value of the denominator @xmath68 becomes zero . in this case , the approximation of taking numerator and denominator separately is not justified .",
    "furthermore , sampling becomes difficult , as outliers may govern the empirical mean and standard deviation .",
    "the analytic derivation is complicated and tedious .",
    "even in the simplest version of random matrix @xmath69 , the entries @xmath7 are all i.i.d . , we need to separate out pairs @xmath70 as they will lead to contributions other than @xmath71 where @xmath72 ( and similarly for higher order tuples ) . in order to do so",
    ", we devised an algorithm to solve it .",
    "the analytical expressions of expected value and variance of the error for different cases of interaction matrices @xmath69 at the highest order in the network size @xmath36 are listed in table [ tab : results ] .",
    ".resulting analytical expressions , approximated to highest order in s [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the results in table [ tab : results ] can be summarized as follow : :    * in all cases , the error ( or its fluctuations ) grows without bound if the ratio @xmath73 goes to zero for a given network size @xmath36 . *",
    "the order of the fluctuations ( namely @xmath74 ) remains the same for all cases , while the order of the expected value changes .",
    "in particular , for interaction matrices @xmath69 without correlation ( @xmath75 ) , the term dominating the error for large @xmath36 are the fluctuations while the mean value is either zero ( for i.i.d . entries @xmath7 ) or of order @xmath76 ( in case of a constant diagonal ) . on the other hand , for networks with non - zero correlation , the mean becomes the dominating term of order @xmath77 . * if the diagonal is of the same scale as @xmath36 , the error may explode .",
    "this happens if @xmath78 , where @xmath79 corresponds to the value of @xmath62 where the interaction matrix becomes stable and non - reactive for positive @xmath57 .",
    "we note that , differently from what is predicted by gao et al . , the approximation does not work for any positive interaction matrix @xmath8 .",
    "in fact , on the one hand , our condition extends the validity of gao et al .",
    "framework for matrix @xmath8 with an asymmetric mixture of positive and negative interactions , as far as @xmath57 is not close to zero .",
    "indeed , we can now understand that the stringent hypothesis on the positivity of the interactions assumed in gao et al seminal work is not necessary . at the same time our results highlight that if matrix @xmath8 has a very large variance with respect to @xmath57 and @xmath36 is not large enough , then the collapse will fail .",
    "for example , if interactions strengths are very heterogenous ( e.g. power law distributed ) , although mutualistic ( positive ) , the system resilience can not be described by the one - dimensional analytical resilience function .    in order to test these analytical results , we sampled the interaction matrix with the corresponding statistics numerically and compared the empirical mean and standard deviation with the theoretical predictions .",
    "the results can be observed in figure [ fig : error_glv_panel ] . in all cases ,",
    "the theoretical predictions are met very well .",

    "the theoretical mean @xmath82 is plotted as a orange line , the shaded area indicates the predicted standard deviation @xmath83 . for all figures ,",
    "the entries of @xmath8 are drawn from a normal distribution with @xmath84 .",
    "the upper plots show the effect network size on the error in the case of ( a ) all elements drawn i.i.d . or ( b ) with positive correlation @xmath85 .",
    "the lower plots show the error for networks of size @xmath86 for ( c ) varying correlation @xmath59 or ( d ) enforcing a constant diagonal @xmath87 relative to the critical value @xmath88 . ]    in our discussion , we set the connectivity ( the fraction of non - zero elements ) to one , i.e. @xmath89 . generalizing our results to not fully connected networks",
    "is straightforward .",
    "we model sparsely connected networks by drawing a mask @xmath90 with entries drawn from a bernoulli distribution , @xmath91 , independently drawing another matrix @xmath92 with specific statistics as before , and finally setting @xmath93 , where @xmath94 denotes the hadamard or entry - wise product .",
    "since @xmath7 and @xmath95 are independent , it suffices to insert the moments @xmath96 , into the calculation of @xmath97 and its variance , c.f .",
    "[ eq : errexp ] and [ eq : errvar ] . for the case of correlated pairs discussed above",
    ", the expression of the expected value remains the same , @xmath98 , while the variance is increased , @xmath99 this is to be expected , as for non - zero mean the sparse mask @xmath90 contributes to the variance .",
    "finally , our results are robust for other definitions of error . in the appendix [ app : anotherdef ]",
    ", we also provide the analytical expressions of another error definition , i.e. the distance from the mean point @xmath100 ) .      in the most general setting , the stationary solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gendyneff ] ) is @xmath101 .",
    "if we use the error definition @xmath102 ( see appendix [ app : anotherdef ] for more details ) , we can have some qualitative insights on the conditions under which the multi - dimensional collapse is expected to work also for more general dynamics than the glv discussed above .",
    "in fact , for the general dynamics given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : gendyn ] ) , then the following equation holds : @xmath103    for glv dynamics , the key quantity in determining the feasibility of the multi - dimensional reduction is a simple function of the product between @xmath59 and @xmath104 compared to the system size @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "we thus ansatz the possibility that this quantity is crucial in determining the quality of the collapse also for different type of dynamics .    if the random matrix @xmath8 is generated by i.i.d .",

    "we show that the collapse may work also for both positive - negative interactions @xmath7 if @xmath36 is large enough shown in figure [ fig : error_gen_normal ] . on the other hand , figure [ fig : error_gen_lognormal ] confirms that condition @xmath0 and @xmath1 and the positivity of the interactions of @xmath8 are not sufficient to guarantee the validity of the one - dimensional approximation also for dynamics beyond glv : if the matrix @xmath8 has a very large variance , the collapse fails also for the specific dynamics used by gao et al ..",
    "in this paper we have shown under which condition a large dynamical system can be effectively approximated with one - dimensional equation .",
    "the order parameter that appears as a variable in the effective equation can be obtained from a simple expression of the local variables . under this approximation",
    ", it becomes clear which properties of the interactions determine the state of the system and it turns out to be possible to quantify their effects .",
    "we explored which properties of the interactions determine the accuracy of the approximation .",
    "in general , the form of the multi - dimensional equations and how their non - linearities are introduced will influence the opportunity to approximate the original set of equations with the corresponding one - dimensional equation . in order to focus on the effect of the interactions , we therefore first have considered a simple idealized scenario  the generalized lotka - volterra equations  where the interactions are linear . in this context , the accuracy of the approximation is only determined by the interaction matrix .",
    "the criterion we obtained relates the variability of the interactions between the agents / nodes and the number of the agents . in particular , for the approximation to work , the size of the system has to be larger than a critical value proportional to the coefficient of variation of the interaction strengths . also the reciprocity of interactions plays an important role : the approximation is expected to work for any interaction strengths if there is not any correlation in the activity between each pair of nodes in the network .",
    "as the correlation between reciprocal interactions is increased , the larger the size of the system must be so to guarantee the accuracy of the approximation .",
    "finally we have shown that the approximation works also for interaction matrices with a mixture of positive and negative signs and that it can be extended to more complicated and non - linear dynamics .",
    "these results open up possible applications of the framework to food - webs , neuronal networks and social / economic interactions .",
