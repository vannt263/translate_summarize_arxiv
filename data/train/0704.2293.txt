    "a solid knowledge of the x - ray source counts is fundamental to fully understand the agns population of the x - ray background ( xrb ) . at present the two deepest x  ray surveys , the _ chandra _ deep field north ( cdfn ; * ? ? ? * ) and _ chandra _ deep field south ( cdfs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , have extended the sensitivity by about two orders of magnitude in all bands with respect to previous surveys @xcite , detecting a large number of faint x  ray sources . however , deep pencil beam surveys are limited by the area which can be covered to very faint fluxes ( typically of the order of 0.1 deg@xmath9 ) and suffer from significant field to field variance . to ovecome this problem ,",
    "shallower surveys over larger areas have been undertaken in the last few years with both _",
    "( e.g. the 9 deg@xmath1 bootes survey @xcite , the extended groth strip egs @xcite , the extended _ chandra _ deep field south e - cdfs , @xcite and th e champ @xcite ) and xmm_newton _  ( e.g. the hellas2xmm survey @xcite , the xmm_newton _   bss @xcite and the elais s1 survey @xcite ) . in this context the xmm_newton _   wide field survey in the cosmos field @xcite , hereinafter xmm  cosmos @xcite , has been conceived and designed to maximize the sensitivity and survey area product , and is expected to provide a major step forward toward a complete characterization of the physical properties of x  ray emitting super massive black holes ( smbhs ) . in this work",
    "we concentrate on the first year of xmm-_newton _ observations ( ao3 ) of the cosmos field @xcite . for more details see cappelluti et  al .",
    "the source detection was performed using a maximum likelihood algorithm provided with the xmm_newton _   standard analysis system ( sas ) in the 0.52 kev , 210 kev and 510 kev bands .",
    "a total of a total of 1281 , 724 and 186 point - like sources were detected in the three bands down to limiting fluxes of 7.2@xmath410@xmath5 erg @xmath6 s@xmath7 , 4.7@xmath410@xmath8 erg @xmath6 s@xmath7 and 9.7@xmath410@xmath8 erg @xmath6 s@xmath7 , respectively . using monte carlo simulation to determine the sky coverage , source number counts can be easily computed using the following equation : @xmath10 , where _ @xmath11 _ is the total number of detected sources in the field with fluxes greater than @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the sky coverage associated with the flux of the i@xmath14 source .",
    "the cumulative number counts , normalized to the euclidean slope ( multiplied by s@xmath15 ) , are shown in figure 1 , for the 0.52 kev , 210 kev and 510 kev energy ranges , respectively .",
    "we performed a broken power - law maximum likelihood fit to the unbinned differential counts in the 0.52 kev and 210 kev energy bands . in the 0.52 kev energy band",
    "the best fit parameters are @xmath16=2.60@xmath17 , @xmath18=1.65@xmath19 , @xmath20=1.55@xmath21 @xmath410@xmath22 erg @xmath6 s@xmath7   and @xmath23=123 . translating this value of the normalization to that for the cumulative distribution at 2@xmath410@xmath8",
    "erg @xmath6 s@xmath7  , which is usually used in the literature for _ chandra _ surveys , we obtain @xmath24450 which is fully consistent with most of previous works where a fit result is presented . in the 210 kev band",
    "the best fit parameters are @xmath16=2.43@xmath25 , @xmath18=1.59@xmath26 , @xmath20=1.02@xmath27 @xmath410@xmath22 erg @xmath6 s@xmath7   and @xmath23=266 .",
    "the latest value translates into @xmath241250 .",
    "also in this band , our results are in agreement with previous surveys within 1@xmath28 . in the 510 kev energy bands",
    ", where the differential counts do not show any evidence for a break in the sampled flux range , we assumed a single power - law model for which the best fit parameters are found to be @xmath23=102 and @xmath16=2.36@xmath29 . in the 0.52 kev band",
    "we measure a contribution of the sources to the xrb which corresponds to a normalization at 1 kev of 7.2@xmath30 kev @xmath6 s@xmath7 kev@xmath7 .",
    "the corresponding values in the 210 kev and 510 kev bands are 4.7@xmath30 kev @xmath6 s@xmath7 kev@xmath7 and 2.6 @xmath31 kev @xmath6 s@xmath7 kev@xmath7",
    ". therefore xmm - cosmos resolves by itself @xmath065@xmath32 , @xmath040@xmath32 and @xmath022@xmath32 of the xrb into discrete sources in the 0.52 kev , 210 kev and 510 kev energy bands , respectively . in figure 1",
    "we compared our logn - logs to those predicted by the recent xrb model of @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of source counts distributions varies significantly among different surveys ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "this `` sample variance '' , can be explained and predicted as a combination of poissonian variations and effects due to the clustering of sources @xcite . in order to determine whether the differences observed in the source counts of different surveys could arise from the clustering of x - ray sources , we estimated the amplitude of the fluctuations from our data , by producing subsamples of our survey with areas comparable to those of .",
    "e.g. , _ chandra _ surveys .",
    "+ the xmm - cosmos field and the monte carlo sample fields of section 4 were divided in 4,9,16 and 25 square boxes .",
    "making use of the 0.52 kev energy band data , we computed for each subfield , the ratio of the number of real sources to the number of random source .",
    "both the random and the real sample were cut to a flux limit of 5@xmath410@xmath8 erg @xmath6 s@xmath7 . in the lower right panel of figure 1 we plot the ratio of the data to the random sample as a function of the size of the cells under investigation .",
    "the predicted fractional standard deviations are 0.13 , 0.19 , 0.23 and 0.28 on scales of 0.44 deg@xmath1 , 0.19 deg@xmath1 , 0.11 deg@xmath1 and 0.07 deg@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the measure fractional standard deviations are 0.09 , 0.20 , 0.21 and 0.24 on the same scales , respectively .",
    "the ratio of the clusting to the poissonian variance is expected to scale as @xmath33 .",
    "we therefore conclude that at this scales and at fluxes sampled here the major contribution to source counts fluctuations is due to poissonian noise .",
    "this analysis is at least qualitatively consistent with figure 2 , which shows a significantly larger dispersion in the data from different surveys in the hard band than in the soft band .",
    "moreover , the results here discussed are also consistent with the observed fluctuations in the deep chandra fields ( see , for example , bauer et al .",
    "large area , moderately deep surveys like xmm - cosmos are needed to overcome the problem of low counting statistics , typical of deep pencil beam surveys , and , at the same time , to provide a robust estimate of the effect of large scale structure on observed source counts . this work is based on observations obtained with xmm_newton _  , an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and nasa ; also based on data collected at the canada - france - hawaii telescope operated by the national research council of canada , the centre national de la recherche scientifique de france and the university of hawaii .",
