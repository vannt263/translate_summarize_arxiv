    "fermi acceleration was first proposed as a mechanism for cosmic ray acceleration @xcite . in the original model , compressive perturbations in the galactic magnetic field , associated with molecular clouds ,",
    "reflect charged particles . if these clouds converge , the particles gain energy over time .",
    "if they diverge , the particles lose energy .",
    "later , it was realized @xcite , that shock fronts are another site of fermi acceleration . in the shock acceleration model , charged particles stream into magnetic perturbations in the post - shock region , reflect , and are scattered back across the shock by pre - shock alfvn waves . repeated reflections steadily accelerate particles to a power law distribution .",
    "this has been studied extensively ( e.g. jones & ellison 1991 ) .",
    "if the shock thickness is determined by the ion gyroradius then ions are picked up out of the thermal population but electrons must be injected at energies at or above the thermal energy by a factor of the ratio of proton to electron mass , @xmath3 , to incur power law acceleration .",
    "the injection process is a critical outstanding problem for many applications of shock acceleration .",
    "shock fermi acceleration is commonly referred to as first order fermi acceleration because the sign of the energy gain after each cycle is positive and @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the electron energy and speed , and @xmath7 the velocity of the magnetic compression .",
    "fermi acceleration can also take place in a fully turbulent plasma .",
    "there , the mirroring sites are turbulent perturbations , typically fast mode magnetohydrodynamic waves , randomly distributed throughout the plasma ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "electrons encounter these perturbations such that there is a stochastic distribution of energy gaining and energy losing reflections . as is demonstrated below ,",
    "there is a net dissipation of turbulent energy into high energy electrons . because the energy gaining and energy losing reflections are equal to first order , stfa",
    "is often referred to as second order fermi acceleration and proceeds more slowly than the first order process . for stfa , @xmath8 .",
    "stfa has been considered extensively as the acceleration mechanism in impulsive solar flares , ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "observations of these flares show hard x - ray emission with a downward breaking power law spectrum extending from @xmath1kev to at least @xmath9mev with the break energy narrowly distributed around @xmath10kev and a thermal distribution at energies below @xmath1kev @xcite .",
    "the time structure of the emission shows distinct spikes of duration @xmath11s and typical energy @xmath12erg @xcite .",
    "non - thermal emission occurs principally at the footpoints of the soft x - ray loop , and to a lesser extent at a loop - top hard x - ray source @xcite .",
    "@xcite has shown that the emission at a dense target is consistent with bremsstrahlung radiation by electrons accelerated to a power law energy distribution at some height above the target ; in impulsive flares the acceleration site can be associated with the loop - top region , while the thick target is associated with the footpoints .",
    "we demonstrate that stfa is possibly responsible for the acceleration of electrons below @xmath1kev , while first order fermi processes at the loop - top fast shock may produce the highest energy electrons . in this picture stfa",
    "also provides power law distributed electrons in the range @xmath1kev@xmath13kev , thus satisfying the shock injection criterion and producing the observed spectral break at @xmath2kev .",
    "it is shown that in order to produce this spectrum the pitch angle scattering must obey the restriction that the scattering distance , @xmath14 , is inversely proportional to the energy of the scattered electron in the @xmath0kev range .",
    "matching the knee is difficult , requiring either a cutoff in the secondary pitch scattering at @xmath2kev , or the sudden onset of yet another pitch scattering agent with a much shorter wavelength . while both are possible",
    ", these requirements provide a serious challenge to stfa models of electron acceleration .",
    "it is important to note that the downward break is not observed in all impulsive solar flares .",
    "indeed , @xcite observed a spread in break energies and spectral indexes .",
    "some of their flares exhibited no discernible break , or even some upward breaks ( ankles ) . in this paper",
    "we address the fundamental process of stfa , and show how it can accommodate the downward breaking spectra observed in a subset of impulsive flares .",
    "the general form of the electron spectra we model is illustrated in figure [ spectrumsample ] .",
    "we assume a thick target bremmstrahlung emission model where the electron spectral index @xmath15 and the photon spectral index @xmath16 are related by @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the data shown are mean values taken from the flares studied by @xcite : @xmath10kev , @xmath18 below @xmath19 , and @xmath20 above @xmath21 .",
    "furthermore , not all flares are observed to be dominated by electron acceleration .",
    "a recent flare observed by @xcite clearly shows regions of emission which are dominated by x - ray emission from electrons as well as regions which are dominated by gyrosynchrotron emission from mev / nucleon ions .",
    "proton and ion emission appears to be associated primarily associated with larger flare loops .",
    "@xcite propose that this can be explained by a two stage process for ion acceleration .",
    "first , ions are accelerated via gyroresonance to speeds of roughly @xmath22 by alfvn waves , and subsequently are accelerated preferentially over electrons by magnetosonic waves .",
    "they argue convincingly for the gyroresonant acceleration by alfvn waves on the basis of relative ion abundances .",
    "however , it is unclear that the second stage acceleration by magnetosonic modes must be resonant .",
    "it appears that the second stage is consistent with stfa . in any event , proton acceleration in long flare loops",
    "presents an interesting problem for acceleration models , in that suepr - alfvnic protons must be preferentially accelerated over electrons , but electron acceleration still must be dominant in shorter loops . in this work ,",
    "we presume that the loops are sufficiently short that protons remain sub - alfvnic . longer loops , and the effects of proton acceleration on the shaping of the observed bremsstrahlung x - ray spectra from high energy electrons , require further study .    stfa is found to depend on two competing effects which we refer to as the steady and diffusive acceleration rates .",
    "the steady rate represents the net acceleration of electrons due to the slight advantage of head - on or energy gaining reflections over catch - up or energy losing reflections .",
    "the diffusive term represents the spreading of the electron distribution function as a result of the stochastic nature of the reflections .",
    "@xcite treats the two effects together using the fokker - planck equation .",
    "likewise , @xcite discuss general solutions of a simplified fokker - planck equation for stfa . in a follow - up work ,",
    "@xcite apply their solution to solar flares .",
    "while they produce spectra consistent with observations , they do not discuss the physics of electron escape .",
    "furthermore , they focus mainly on the regime above @xmath2kev",
    ". some past treatments of stfa in impulsive flares focused exclusively on the diffusive term .",
    "@xcite derives the diffusive acceleration rate using simple physical arguments .",
    "@xcite derives the diffusive term using both phenomenological arguments and quasi - linear theory .",
    "the latter also includes coloumb losses as a small correction ; this is of note since the coloumb loss term is mathematically similar to a negative steady acceleration term .",
    "herein we derive the steady term and compare it to the diffusive term , finding the steady acceleration to be dominant in the non - relativistic regime for impulsive flares .",
    "as will be seen , our steady term differs slightly from that of some previous calculations such as that in @xcite in its dependence on the turbulent magnetic fluctuation strength .",
    "this arises because we average only over the pitch angle phase space for which stfa operates in magnetic mirroring , whereas @xcite averaged over all pitch angles in considering a more generic form of fermi acceleration .",
    "a similar averaging over all pitch angles is performed in @xcite .",
    "we first review the basic fermi process using a test particle approach .",
    "we then derive an expression for the mean acceleration of electrons in a turbulent plasma via stfa , and compare this to the diffusive stfa derived by @xcite .",
    "finally , we discuss the trapping of electrons in the turbulent accelerating region and show that at non - relativistic energies , the electron spectrum depends strongly on the energy dependence of pitch angle scattering . for scattering by whistler wave turbulence ,",
    "the emerging spectrum is quasi - thermal . in order to produce the @xmath0kev power law in solar flares ,",
    "we show that there must be an additional source of pitch angle scattering which has a length scale inversely dependent on electron energy ; this mechanism is tightly constrained .",
    "the existence of such a pitch angle scattering mechanism is yet to be determined .",
    "this brings to the fore the most pressing difficulty with stfa models of electron acceleration ; the pitch angle scattering requirements are stringent and might not be possible to meet .",
    "consider a particle of charge @xmath23 traveling with gyroradius @xmath24 in a magnetic field of strength @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the charge follows a helical path , orbiting the field line while also moving parallel ( or anti - parallel ) to the field line . taking the condition for circular motion and the lorentz force    @xmath26    where @xmath23 is the electron charge , and applying conservation laws for angular momentum and kinetic energy ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 constant ) yields    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the angular momentum of the charge , @xmath5 the kinetic energy , and @xmath31 relates the total velocity to the component perpendicular to the field line .",
    "the pitch angle , @xmath32 , is the angle between the field line and the velocity vector .",
    "as the charge enters a region of increasing @xmath25 , such as a magnetic compression , the pitch angle evolves according to    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the increase in field strength and @xmath35 is the pitch angle at field strength @xmath36 .",
    "when @xmath37 , the charge can not penetrate further into the compression , and reflects .",
    "this process , known as magnetic mirroring , is commonly used to confine laboratory plasmas @xcite .",
    "it follows immediately that mirroring will not occur at a given compression unless the initial pitch angle satisfies    @xmath38    fermi ( 1949 , 1954 ) showed that moving magnetic mirrors , in particular molecular clouds , can accelerate charges . in the cloud s frame of reference ( primed ) , mirroring results in only a change in the sign of @xmath39 , the component of the initial velocity of the charge parallel to the field line in the compression s rest frame .",
    "let us work for the moment in the limit where the compression speed and the particle speed are both @xmath40 .",
    "transforming to the lab frame , @xmath41 , where @xmath7 is the drift velocity of the cloud .",
    "the positive ( negative ) sign is for head - on ( catch - up ) reflections between the charge and cloud .",
    "catch - up reflections are defined as those where the components of the compression and charge velocities parallel to the field line have the same sign .",
    "head on reflections are those where the parallel components have opposite signs .",
    "the net change in energy from a reflection is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the speeds after and before reflection , @xmath45 is the mass of the charge , and @xmath46 . head - on reflections result in a positive energy change , while catch - up reflections can result in a negative energy change when @xmath47 . in both types of reflection",
    ", there is the positive term proportional to @xmath48 .",
    "one can repeat this derivation using lorentz transformations in place of the galilean transformations to generalize this result to particles of any energy scattered by compressions which are still restricted to non - relativistic velocities . for",
    "a derivation see @xcite ; we simply cite the result :    @xmath49 , \\label{estep}\\ ] ]    where @xmath50 is the speed of light in vacuum . over time , charges trapped between converging magnetic compressions are subject to only head - on reflections , and are accelerated to higher energies .",
    "notice that the change in momentum of a fermi accelerated electron is solely in the component parallel to the mean field .",
    "this corresponds to an increase in the electron s pitch angle . as an extreme example , consider an electron of initial energy @xmath51 with pitch angle in the mean field @xmath25 approaching @xmath52 . upon doubling the electron s energy via fermi acceleration , the pitch angle in the mean field",
    "is reduced to @xmath53 . clearly ,",
    "acceleration to high energy must be accompanied by some additional scattering agent which isotropizes electron pitch angles on a short time scale , otherwise fermi acceleration shuts off after small accelerations as pitch angles evolve out of the range given by ( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "the well known problem of pitch angle scattering remains largely unsolved ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "fermi acceleration is distinct from the transit time damping ( ttd ) treated , for example , in @xcite .",
    "ttd is the magnetic analog of landau damping . in ttd , electrons ( or ions ) which are near gyroresonance with waves of wavenumbwer @xmath54 are pushed towards the resonance by field gradients in the wave which alter the parallel component of the velocity .",
    "gradients in the electron velocity spectrum result in a net damping or enhancement of the waves . in the presence of a spectrum of waves ,",
    "an electron can drift from resonance at @xmath54 to @xmath55 and so forth , eventually reaching high energies .",
    "fermi acceleration , however , is a non - resonant interaction .",
    "electrons will mirror at a compression regardless of energy provided that the pitch angle is sufficiently large .",
    "ttd is often referred to as resonant fermi acceleration because the two processes rely on similar physics .",

    "we now consider the behavior of charges in a turbulent magnetic plasma where magnetosonic modes provide the sites of magnetic mirroring .",
    "this scenario differs from first order fermi acceleration by shocks in two ways .",
    "1 ) consecutive mirroring events are not coherent , but rather stochastically distributed between head - on and catch - up .",
    "2 ) the turbulent cascade governs the acceleration efficiency ; the system picks out a scale where acceleration competes with the cascade . in the solar corona plasma , @xmath7 ,",
    "the velocity of the magnetic compressions , is the phase speed of the magnetosonic modes , which is roughly the alfvn speed for the fast mode and the sound speed ( @xmath56 ) for the slow mode .",
    "typically , thermal electrons in the corona are super - alfvnic and non - relativistic , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 ; we will solve the stfa problem in this regime .",
    "recall that the energy gain from a typical reflection is given in eq.([epm ] ) to be @xmath59 .",
    "we define three parameters : @xmath60 , the total rate of reflections ; @xmath61 , the rate of head - on reflections ; and @xmath62 , the rate of catch - up reflections .",
    "the relation @xmath63 is automatically satisfied by this definition as all reflections must be of either the head - on or catch - up type .",
    "this allows us to write the approximate acceleration rate as the sum of a coherent term and an incoherent term :    @xmath64 , \\label{sdefine}\\ ] ]    where the subscript @xmath65 is used to distinguish our derived acceleration rate from that of @xcite .",
    "the first term , proportional to @xmath66 represents the mean acceleration due to the offset in the rates of the two types of reflection .",
    "the second term , proportional to @xmath67 , the total reflection rate , represents the coherent term .",
    "this expression gives a full description of the mean acceleration of charges by the non - relativistic stfa process . to evaluate it in a particular plasma requires the determination of the head - on and catch - up reflection rates @xmath61 and @xmath62 .    in order to obtain @xmath61 and @xmath62 , consider the path a charge takes to encounter a mirror .",
    "note that there is a distinction between an encounter and a mirroring because of the pitch angle condition for reflection .",
    "we take the fraction of encounters which reflect to be @xmath68 and assume that this fraction is the same for both head - on and catch - up encounters : @xmath69 .",
    "this assumption is often taken in the regime where @xmath70 @xcite . while this assumption is not strictly true , the effects of relaxing it are negligible . in appendix b we repeat this calculation without assuming @xmath71 .",
    "there is a well defined mean distance between encounters , @xmath72 as well as a relative velocity between the particle and the compression @xmath73 .",
    "the small difference in the head - on and catch - up speeds is responsible for the offset in rates . for each type of encounter , the mean separation is @xmath74 and the rate of reflections of any sort is specified by the general relation @xmath75 , with @xmath76 the relative velocity between the particle and compression , yielding    @xmath77    the offset in rates is thus    @xmath78    and we can rewrite the average acceleration rate as    @xmath79    with the associated acceleration time scale @xmath80 .",
    "we thus see that the acceleration due to the offset in head - on and catch - up reflection rates and the acceleration from the coherent term in @xmath7 are equal .    to simplify the derivation of the electron spectrum , we recast ( [ ratecalcfirst ] ) as @xmath81 where we used ( [ erates ] ) and define @xmath82 as the total number of reflections experienced by an electron , @xmath83 , and @xmath84    the quantity @xmath85 , the mean acceleration of an electron per reflection , will be of particular use when examining electron escape in section [ sec : spec ] .",
    "a different approach was taken by @xcite .",
    "they set @xmath86 in the @xmath70 regime and studied the diffusion of particles through energy space via random walk .",
    "the starting point in their calculation of the electron acceleration was the timescale for the e - folding of a charged particle s energy in the turbulent plasma @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the number of mirrorings required to double the particle s energy and @xmath89 is the time between encounters .",
    "they set @xmath90 , and also dropped the last term in @xmath48 in eq [ estep ] . from ( [ sdefine ] ) and ( [ ratecalcfirst ] ) it is clear that if one of their two assumptions is valid the other must also apply , and @xmath91 in that limit . under these assumptions @xmath92 and @xmath93",
    "are equal in magnitude , and from the standard solution of an evenly weighted random walk @xmath94 .",
    "the acceleration rate is then    @xmath95    where @xmath44 is the total initial speed and the subscript @xmath96 is used to denote larosa et al s diffusive acceleration rate .    to complete the calculation of the acceleration rates ,",
    "we must obtain @xmath68 and average over pitch angles .",
    "the minimum accessible pitch angle for reflection is related to @xmath68 by    @xmath97    where we have applied the reflection condition from ( [ 3 ] ) . in the regime",
    "where the compression ratio @xmath98 , which will apply to the plasma of interest , and taking the assumption that pitch angles are isotropic gives @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "we now write the averaged acceleration rates as    @xmath101    @xmath102    what do these two acceleration rates represent ?",
    "@xmath103 is the steady growth of the mean kinetic energy due to the drain of turbulence by the combined effects the slightly non - zero @xmath66 and the coherent @xmath104 term : a shift of the mean electron energy to higher energy . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath105 represents the diffusion of energies away from the mean via random walk : a spreading of the distribution .",
    "the relative importance of the two is fixed by their ratio    @xmath106    the combined result of the action of both processes on an initially narrow gaussian energy distribution is shown in fig.[evolved ] where we have chosen @xmath107 . and assume that electrons do not escape .",
    "thus we can examine the evolution of electron energy spectra solely due to the influence of the two acceleration rates .",
    "as @xmath108 is increased , the steady ( mean growth ) term becomes increasingly dominant over the diffusive ( distribution widening ) term . to understand stfa in a particular plasma , both acceleration rates must be calculated . in the event that the diffusive rate is very small",
    "compared to the steady growth rate , it can be ignored .",
    "the steady growth rate is always faster than the diffusive growth rate for @xmath109 .",
    "as will be shown later , @xmath110 in flare plasmas , and the diffusive term is negligible .",
    "it is very important to note that our result differs from the standard for fermi acceleration , in which both the diffusive and steady terms depend on the same power of @xmath111 .",
    "this difference arises as a result of the averaging over pitch angles . to correctly obtain @xmath112 ,",
    "one must only average over those encounters which result in a reflection . for traditional stfa , the range of pitch angles which reflect is ultimately determined by the turbulent magnetic field strength .",
    "one factor of @xmath113 in the expression to be averaged results in one factor of @xmath114 in the acceleration rate .",
    "in other treatments , such as that of @xcite , the acceleration mechanism is assumed to act at all pitch angles . in this case , the averaging over @xmath115 while maintaining the asumption of pitch angle isotropy , yeilds a numerical value with no @xmath34 dependence . in this regime ,",
    "the diffusive and steady acceleration terms have the same relative strength at all levels of turbulence .",
    "this leaves @xmath116 as the remaining parameter to be determined .",
    "it is related to the turbulent length scale @xmath72 through the cascade law .",
    "magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence proceeds by the shredding of like sized eddies and subsequent formation of smaller eddies ; energy input into eddies on a large ( outer ) length scale , @xmath117 , cascades rapidly to smaller length scales on the eddy turnover time , @xmath118 , and finally dissipates at @xmath119 , the dissipation scale .",
    "if the cascade obeys komolgorov s steady state assumption then the energy flow through all length scales is constant , and independent of the scale .",
    "this results in an inertial range between the scales @xmath117 and @xmath119 where the turbulent energy density has a power law dependence on eddy size .",
    "the draining of turbulence at eddy size @xmath119 is usually determined by a micro - physical process , such as resistivity .",
    "when stfa is active , the turbulence can instead be drained by pumping energy into electrons .",
    "this sets another condition for stfa to proceed in a plasma : there must be some @xmath120 which is greater than the resistive length scale at which the stfa timescale is shorter than the cascade time , otherwise the turbulence will drain at the resistive scale before stfa can produce an appreciable electron acceleration .",
    "there are three major mhd wavemodes : alfvn waves , and the fast and slow magnetosonic waves .",
    "alfvn waves are purely transverse , and thus do not compress the magnetic field ; they can not participate in stfa .",
    "both the fast and slow modes are compressive , and are in principle capable of fermi acceleration .",
    "it has been argued that in low @xmath121 plasmas such as the solar corona , the slow mode is rapidly dissipated via landau damping @xcite .",
    "however , more recent studies of mhd turbulence indicate that the cascade time for gs turbulence is significantly shorter than the electron damping time , and slow mode damping by electrons can be ignored in turbulent flare plasmas @xcite .",
    "a key difference in the two analyses is that @xcite treats mhd turbulence as inherently anisotropic , whereas @xcite assumes isotropy .",
    "furthermore , maron ( private communication ) has shown in simulations which neglect damping that the slow mode may be driven with much higher total energy content than the fast mode at low @xmath121 .",
    "a definitive resolution of the issue is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , we should point out that up to this point , the calculation is independent of the choice of wave mode .",
    "there is one significant difference between the two , however : slow modes propagate at roughly the sound speed ( @xmath122 ) while fast modes propagate at roughly the alfvn speed ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "it will be shown that due to the influence of pitch angle scattering , stfa is likely dominated by the fast mode .",
    "mhd turbulence is in general anisotropic ; the direction of any large scale mean magnetic field defines a preferred axis .",
    "also , even if the turbulence is isotropic on large scales , smaller scales may see the larger scale turbulent structures as an effective mean field .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter , gs ) modified the the komolgorov assumption for the cascade of slow and alvfn modes of mhd turbulence under the condition that the turbulence is anisotropic with scale @xmath124 along the field line and @xmath125 perpendicular to the field line .",
    "the two directions are found to obey different cascade laws , with @xmath124 cascading more weakly than @xmath125 .",
    "the parallel direction is of more importance to stfa , as it represents the distance along the field line between reflection sites .",
    "the gs power law for the parallel scale is @xcite    @xmath126    where @xmath25 is the mean magnetic field strength , and @xmath34 is the turbulent field strength at parallel length scale @xmath72 .",
    "the exact power law of mhd turbulence remains the subject of some debate , so for now we assume a general power law of form @xmath127 where @xmath128 is an arbitrary index . using the turbulent power spectrum and substituting for @xmath68 from ( [ feq ] )",
    "we can rewrite the acceleration rates as    @xmath129    for a typical turbulent cascade , where @xmath130 and @xmath131 , @xmath132 .",
    "there remains the final step of determining the particular dissipation scale @xmath120 at which the energy drain takes place .",
    "in order for stfa to overcome the cascade of mhd turbulence , it must drain energy at a rate equal to the input rate at the outer scale .",
    "if turbulent compressions are shredded and cascade faster than electrons can draw out energy via reflections , then the cascade continues to smaller length scales . at smaller scales , stfa is more rapid .",
    "stfa becomes competitive with the cascade at a scale determined by @xmath133 .",
    "@xmath103 is acceleration rate of electrons and @xmath134 is the cascade rate of turbulent energy , @xmath135 .",
    "the stfa scale @xmath120 is different for acceleration by the two compressive mhd modes .    for slow mode turbulence , @xmath136 , and",
    "the balance is    @xmath137    solving for @xmath138 and associating this particular @xmath72 with @xmath120 gives    @xmath139^{\\frac{a}{1-a}}.\\ ] ]    in solar flares and a gs turbulent cascade ( @xmath140 ) , @xmath141cm / s , @xmath142cm / s and @xmath143cm / s @xcite , this gives @xmath144 .",
    "we have taken the initial electron velocity to be the mean velocity of the thermal background plasma .",
    "the cascade will proceed down the inertial range to this length scale where stfa then acts as the micro - physical damping agent , rapidly draining the energy from turbulence into particles .    in the case of the fast mode , where @xmath145 , the rate balance is    @xmath146    and the stfa length scale",
    "is then given by    @xmath147^{\\frac{a}{1-a}}.\\ ] ]    for solar flare conditions , and a gs cascade ( @xmath140 ) , @xmath148 .",
    "we have tacitly assumed that the length scale for pitch angle isotropization is roughly equal to @xmath72 .",
    "if it is not , the acceelration rate is retarded significantly , and stfa can be shut off . to understand this",
    "we must further explore the role of pitch angle scattering .    as discussed above , pitch angle scattering",
    "is necessary during acceleration to maintain a population of electrons which satisfy the pitch angle condition for reflection .",
    "the strength of the pitch angle scattering strongly regulates the rate of acceleration .",
    "we consider three cases : @xmath149 , @xmath150 , and @xmath151 where eddy @xmath152 is the typical distance over which pitch angles are isotropized . in the first case , @xmath149 , electrons reflect a few times and quickly leave the pitch angle range in which they can reflect .",
    "they then must stream a distance of order @xmath152 before they can scatter again .",
    "thus the rate of reflections and the acceleration rate are both decreased by a factor of @xmath153 .",
    "since the acceleration rate and cascade rate are not in balance , the cascade continues down to smaller scales @xmath154 . the nominal acceleration rate ( eq [ ratesarray ] ) is proportional to @xmath155 , while the retardation factor is proportional to @xmath72 .",
    "the combined effect is a net acceleration rate which is proportional to @xmath156 ; smaller scale turbulence is actually less efficient as an accelerator . as a result ,",
    "stfa never turns on in this regime . in the second case , @xmath150 ,",
    "the pitch angle scattering is far more rapid than acceleration .",
    "since pitch scattering can take an electron through @xmath157 , very strongly pitch scattered electrons traverse the plasma by random walking in steps of length @xmath152 , again reducing the rate of reflection , this time by a factor of @xmath158 . unlike the previous case , this is not a problem for stfa",
    "; the retarding factor tends towards unity as the cascade continues to scales @xmath154 .",
    "the net acceleration rate is proportional to @xmath159 , and stfa turns on as the cascade proceeds to a sufficiently small scale . in case three , where @xmath160 , pitch angle scattering and reflections proceed at the same rate .",
    "thus , electrons are capable of streaming freely from compression to compression , while they maintain a nearly isotropic pitch angle distribution .",
    "this is the simplest pitch angle scattering regime for stfa .",
    "the identity of the accelerating wavemode is now easy to determine . in section [ sec : pesc ]",
    "we show that whistler wave turbulence is a plausible source of pitch angle scattering , at least for the lower energy quasi - thermal component of the spectrum . at @xmath161kev",
    ", @xmath162 is roughly @xmath163 .",
    "this places slow mode turbulence ( @xmath144 ) well in the first regime .",
    "slow modes do not participate in stfa in these flares .",
    "fast modes , however , have @xmath164 and therefore are in the nearly ideal range for acceleration .",
    "furthermore , both @xmath120 and @xmath152 grow linearly with electron energy , so as electrons undergo stfa by fast modes in the presence of whistler wave turbulence , they remain in the same pitch angle scattering regime throughout .",
    "the simplest case of stfa is the steady state , where we assume that electrons are injected into a turbulent region at energy @xmath51 at a rate equal to that at which accelerated electrons escape .",
    "the turbulent energy supply is continuously replenished at a large scale .",
    "we are concerned with the energy spectrum , @xmath165 , of electrons escaping the region .",
    "note that this is in general different from the spectrum of the electrons within the turbulent region .",
    "we define @xmath166 to be the total number of electrons reaching energy at least @xmath5 before escaping , such that @xmath167 initially , we consider the case of strongly relativistic electrons ; a full derivation of this regime is presented in the appendix .    to appreciate the calculational differences between the non - relativistic regime of interest to solar flares and the more commonly studied relativistic regime , we begin with the latter . following the approach used by @xcite for shock fermi acceleration , and writing @xmath168 , where @xmath169 is the mean probability of an electron escaping from the acceleration region , gives    @xmath170    where on the right hand side we have for the moment taken the strongly relativistic limit : @xmath171 and assumed @xmath169 to be constant .",
    "this treatment of the highly relativistic limit follows @xcite .",
    "one can solve for @xmath166 by separating variables , integrating both sides and inverting the logarithms , resulting in the familiar power law ( see e.g. @xcite )    @xmath172    where @xmath88 is the total number of electrons . from eq .",
    "( [ n(e)fromn_t ] ) , one obtains    @xmath173    where @xmath174 is the number density of escaped electrons with @xmath175 .",
    "notice that the logarithmic integrals in both @xmath176 and @xmath5 are vital to producing the power law .",
    "for stfa by fast mode waves , the computation is more complicated because @xmath169 is energy dependent .",
    "we solve for a general @xmath169 in the non - relativistic regime , leaving the specification of the trapping for later discussion . in the non - relativistic regime ,",
    "the acceleration rate is not proportional to the kinetic energy as it is in the strongly relativistic regime .",
    "instead , one has @xmath177 .",
    "we thus write , using ( [ 11 ] ) ,    @xmath178    which can be rewritten as    @xmath179    we have assumed that @xmath180 .",
    "this is reasonable as long as the electrons can be treated as statistically independent and collisionless . in this case",
    ", it is reasonable to assume that @xmath169 carries no inherent dependence on @xmath176 and the escape rate is simly given by the product of the number of electrons in the volume and the mean escape probability .",
    "taking @xmath181 allows us to solve for a particularly interesting @xmath165 .",
    "we see immediately that    @xmath182    and @xmath165 is again a power law energy distribution :    @xmath183    where @xmath184 .",
    "however , in any other case , stfa does not produce a simple power law .",
    "the importance of the trapping mechanism is now clear ; the combined energy dependence of the acceleration and escape must be @xmath185 to produce a power law spectrum .",
    "such a spectrum relies on the coincidental logarithmic integrals over both @xmath88 and @xmath5 .",
    "let us now calculate @xmath169 for non - relativistic electrons within the turbulent volume , and consequently the energy spectrum of electrons",
    ". for simplicity , let us take the turbulent region to be rectangular , with the long axis , @xmath186 , parallel to the direction of the bulk flow , with @xmath187 and @xmath188 fixed to the downstream and upstream boundaries of the region respectively .",
    "@xmath189 is taken to be the extent of the region of turbulent flow , which is presumed to be the entire distance between the reconnection sheet and the top of the soft x - ray loop .",
    "this distance is typically of size @xmath190 cm for solar flares @xcite .",
    "the largest eddy size in the turbulence , @xmath117 is set by the width of the outflow , typically @xmath191 cm .",
    "thus the turbulent volume consists of a number of cells , each of which flows downward from the reconnection point towards the loop - top .",
    "an electron escapes the acceleration region only when it reaches the x - ray loop at the base of the turbulent region .",
    "these individual cells may be associaetd with single bursts or fragments of x - ray emission , and thus are responsible for the temporal structure of impulsive flares . in order to escape the region with energy @xmath192 ,",
    "an electron must stream from its location in the region at some height @xmath186 to the boundary at @xmath187 after the @xmath82th reflection without further reflection .",
    "we will assume that the electrons are contained in the region in the @xmath193 plane by gyration around large scale field lines . to further simplify the problem",
    ", we shall assume that the electron density remains uniform throughout the turbulent region .",
    "we also neglect the bulk flow speed , @xmath194 cm s@xmath195 @xcite since the legth of the downflow region is roughly @xmath190 cm .",
    "this gives a flow time from the reconnection region to the loop - top of @xmath2s .",
    "the acceleration process is fixed to the much shorter @xmath196s time scale by the temporal size of the observed energy release fragments and the mhd eddy turnover time .",
    "thus , bulk flow into the flare loop is not likely to be a dominant process in cutting off the acceleration .",
    "take the mean @xmath186-component of the distance streamed between reflections to be @xmath197 ; @xmath197 carries an energy dependence inherited from the energy dependence of the pitch scattering .",
    "the probability of escaping at @xmath187 after the @xmath82th reflection from a point at height @xmath186 is given by    @xmath198    and the mean escape probability of electrons distributed uniformly across the length of the region is    @xmath199    where we have taken @xmath200 from the isotropy in pitch angles , with @xmath152 the pitch angle scattering length scale . to obtain the spectrum of solar flare electrons",
    "requires specification of the pitch angle scattering .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite assume strong scattering , and suggest that the scattering agent above @xmath196kev is resonant interaction with lower hybrid ( lh ) turbulence , or circularly polarized electromagnetic waves , such as whistler waves .",
    "below 1kev , coulomb interactions are thought to be sufficiently strong to isotropize the electrons .",
    "it should be noted that @xcite sets the threshold for the whistler mode resonance at @xmath201 kev for flare plasmas , while @xcite argue that the resonances extend down to @xmath196kev .",
    "we assume the latter . in a recent study ,",
    "@xcite considered whether lh wave turbulence is the primary mode of electron acceleration in solar flares .",
    "they concluded that the pitch angle scattering is too inefficient to maintain isotropy .",
    "thus , we assume that lh wave turbulence can not supply sufficient pitch angle scattering to sustain stfa either .",
    "whistler waves are more promising .    @xcite associates the frequency of pitch angle scattering @xmath202 with the pitch angle diffusion coefficient in the quasi - linear equation .",
    "thus , @xmath203 is the chracteristic time scale for effective pitch angle isotropization of the electron distribution .",
    "it should be noted that , in general , some small anisotropy is likely to remain in the distribution , and that this anisotropy could be responsible for the generation of the whistler waves .",
    "however , the source of these waves is still uncertain . from @xcite",

    "this allows us to rewrite ( [ nu ] ) as    @xmath209    where we have used @xmath210 , @xmath211 , @xmath212 , and the dimensionless parameters @xmath213 g and @xmath214@xmath215 .",
    "we must compare @xmath202 to the growth time for pitch angle anisotropy due to stfa .",

    "scattering by whistler waves must occur on a time scale shorter than pitch angle evolution by stfa .",
    "thus , as long as @xmath228 , isotropy can be maintained .",
    "this condition is met for all @xmath229 .",
    "whistler modes , if present , are capable of providing sufficient pitch angle scattering to maintain isotropy .",
    "in addition to maintaining pitch angle isotropy , the scattering mechanism must also operate at a length scale which traps electrons in the volume ; @xmath230 cm must be satisfied , or else electrons rapidly leave the acceleration region and stfa shuts off .",
    "we obtain the pitch scattering length scale for whistler waves , @xmath231 ,    @xmath232    the required condition is satisfied for energies below @xmath2kev .      in order to obtain the spectrum of the escaped electrons",

    "this is consistent with the thermal component to the flare spectrum observed using rhessi @xcite .",

    "more recent observations with rhessi could push the low energy threshold for the power law as high as @xmath239kev @xcite .",
    "the spectral index below the break is @xmath240 , while above the break it is @xmath241 . elsewhere",
    "( blackman ( 1997 ) ; selkowitz and blackman ( 2004 ) in preparation ) , we discuss first order acceleration at the loop - top fast shock .",
    "fast shocks are well known to accelerate super - thermal particles to power law energy spectra , even in the non - relativistic limit @xcite . however , in order to be accelerated , electrons must satisfy the requirement that @xmath242kev in solar flare plasmas , where @xmath243 cm s@xmath195 is the inflow speed of the plasma at the shock @xcite .",
    "this places the injection energy at rougly @xmath2kev .",
    "the correspondence of the shock injection energy and the observed break energy is noteworthy .",
    "a possible mechanism to reproduce the observations is for stfa to produce a power law spectrum in the @xmath0kev regime which then satisfies the injection criterion for loop - top fast shocks . since stfa by magnetosonic turbulence in the presence of whistler wave turbulence pitch scattering is insufficient to produce the power law component .",
    "however , it is possible that a second pitch scattering agent exists which produces the power law in the @xmath0kev range",
    ". we examine the constraints imposed on this scattering .    to produce a power law spectrum ,",
    "non - relativistic stfa requires @xmath244 . from ( [ pesc ] ) , we see that this is true only if @xmath245 , where @xmath246 and the exponential term is small . here @xmath247 is a constant parameter which fixes the strength of the pitch scattering . while the physics of the pitch angle scattering is not well understood , this constrains the scattering mechanisms available to stfa .",
    "we define @xmath248 cm to be the pitch scattering length scale of the constrained mechanism , and the electron spectum is given by    @xmath249    @xmath247 is constrained by the observed x - ray spectral index of @xmath250 .",
    "it is a standard prediction of flare models @xcite that the spectrum of electrons accelerated above the loop - top is steeper than the spectrum of the thick target bremstrahlung x - rays emitted at the footpoints in solar flares .",

    "the electron spectral index could conceivably be as high as @xmath254 , in which case @xmath255 , and the exponential can still be safely neglected .",
    "it is insufficient to merely produce the proper power law .",

    "there is one more important constraint imposed by the observations : the knee at @xmath2kev .",
    "@xcite demonstrate a distinct downward break in the power law spectrum at roughly @xmath261kev .",
    "the break energy varies somewhat from flare to flare , but is consistently observed in all of the impulsive flares in their sample . unlike downward breaks , upward breaks",
    "are easily explained by the meshing of two acceleration mechanisms , as the shallow component which dominates above the break emerges naturally from beneath the steeper power law which dominates below . for upward breaks , @xmath19 is the naturally occurring crossover point .",
    "the matching problem is much more difficult for knees in the absence of significant cooling on timescales of interest .",
    "since the steep component is above the break energy and the shallow component below it , both must be truncated at the break energy .",
    "if either one extended beyond the break , then that one would overrun the other , and there would be no break at all . the most natural solution for a knee is a single acceleration mechanism which undergoes some transition at the break energy .",
    "one such example is the knee found by @xcite in the spectra of shock accelerated electrons at roughly @xmath196gev .",
    "this knee results from the transition from the non - relativistic to the relativistic regime .",
    "there is no apparent natural transition for stfa of electrons at @xmath2kev . however , there is a well defined low energy cutoff for a power law spectrum at @xmath2kev , the shock injection energy .",
    "the shock injection threshold is not only at the right energy , but is also a variable cutoff , depending on the ion temperature and local magnetic field strength , consistent with the variability in the observed @xmath19 .",
    "@xcite has shown that shock acceleration does not change the spectrum of electrons if the pre - shock spectrum is shallower than the post - shock spectrum which obtains from a steep pre - shock spectrum .",
    "shock fermi acceleration can not steepen a power law spectrum ; it can only make it shallower .",
    "this is another difficulty for knee matching .",
    "the stfa spectrum must have a sharp cutoff at @xmath19 in order to match the knee .",
    "this may not be an impossible condition to meet , especially as @xmath19 may be greater that the injection energy , not precisely equal to it .",
    "one natural cutoff occurs when @xmath262 ; acceleration will shut off when the cascade reaches the resistive scale . for slow modes in impulsive flares , @xmath263 cm @xcite , which for @xmath264kev gives a cutoff energy of @xmath265 kev , which is both too high and far outside of the non - relativistic regime .",
    "a possible solution is that the constrained pitch scattering has a maximum resonant threshold at @xmath19 .",
    "another possible solution is that yet another very strong pitch scattering mechanism has a threshold energy of @xmath19 and a length scale @xmath266 .",
    "both of these solutions are presently ad hoc .",
    "this underscores the need for a more thorough understanding of pitch angle scattering in astrophysical plasmas .",
    "it also illustrates the limitations of stfa as an acceleration mechanism in solar flares ; if stfa alone were to account for the spectrum from @xmath0 kev , the tight constraints on the pitch angle scattering mechanism that we have identified are required .",
    "stfa in the non - relativistic limit behaves differently from highly relativistic stfa . at the core of these differences",
    "is the energy dependence of the electron velocity at low energies .",
    "thus , unlike the relativistic case , both the rate of reflections and the probability of escaping the acceleration region at an energy @xmath5 vary . using a test particle approach , we have examined this behavior and derived the spectrum of post - acceleration electrons in a plasma under impulsive solar flare conditions .    for traditional stfa , where there is a minimum pitch angle constraint which determines whether an individual encounter results in reflection , it is seen that the steady acceleration rate can dominate over the diffusive acceleration rate .",
    "this arises from the averaging over pitch angles to evaluate @xmath112 .",
    "some previous treatments of the generalized fermi acceleration problem do not have such reflection conditions , and thus do not retain factors of the turbulent field strength , @xmath116 , when averaging . in those treatments , such as @xcite , the steady and diffusive terms",
    "typically are seen to be of the same order .",
    "for some processes this is appropriate , however non - resonant stfa is not one of them .",
    "thus , the phase space conditions for scattering by the acceleration mechanism can play a very significant role , even in cases where pitch angle isotropy is maintained .",
    "the nature of the pitch angle scattering turns out to be the dominant factor in determining electron escape , and therefore the shape of the spectrum .",
    "we find that whistler wave turbulence , which is well studied in solar flares @xcite , is an excellent source of pitch angle scattering which allows stfa to produce a quasi - thermal electron distribution that peaks at @xmath267kev .",
    "this matches the lowest energy portion of the observed x - ray emission very well .",
    "however , to produce the power law spectrum observed in the range @xmath268kev by stfa requires at least a second scattering mechanism .",
    "matching the spectral index and the transition energy from quasi - thermal to power law spectrum requires an undetermined scattering mechanism which satisfies @xmath269 with @xmath270 , and naturally becomes the dominant pitch angle scatterer at roughly @xmath271kev .",
    "if the constrained pitch angle scattering mechanism is discovered , it implies that the acceleration of electrons in solar flares is at least a two stage process .",
    "the first stage , stfa in the downflow region , produces both the quasi - thermal spectrum below @xmath272 and the lower half of the power law spectrum up to @xmath2kev . to produce the highest energy electrons , as well as",
    "the spectral break at @xmath273kev requires a second acceleration mechanism at the top of the soft x - ray loop .",
    "we are further exploring the possibility that first order acceleration at a weak fast shock , formed as the downflow impacts the top of the closed flare loop , is responsible for electron acceleration to the highest observed energies .",
    "acceleration at fast shocks is known to have an injection energy of roughly @xmath2kev , and varies with temperature .",
    "this coincides with the break in the power law spectrum at @xmath2kev , and is consistent with the variability observed by @xcite in @xmath19 .",
    "recently , chandran ( 2003 ) concluded , using quasi - linear theory , that stfa for slow modes is not viable in the 10 - 100kev regime . while we also find slow modes to be ineffective , differences between our paper and @xcite must be kept in mind .",
    "chandran ( 2003 ) assumed that @xmath274 for stfa .",
    "while this is true in the strongly relativistic limit for stfa , we do not assume that this is true in the lower energy regime ( see eq .",
    "second , unlike chandran ( 2003 ) we do not assume herein that @xmath275 has to be energy independent .",
    "these two assumptions play a significant role in shaping electron spectra .",
    "another concern which can be raised about the effectiveness of stfa as the electron acceleration engine in impulsive flares is the total energetics of the process . since stfa , as developed above , only is efficient in a short length scale regime where one also has @xmath276 it might seem that only a small fraction of the released flare energy is available for electron acceleration .",
    "this is not the case .",
    "the total energy contained in single turbulent cell is given by @xmath277erg , where @xmath278@xmath215 is the electron number density in the flare plasma .",
    "the energy in a single turbulent cell is similar to the energy contained in one x - ray emission fragment .",
    "although only a fraction of the energy in one turbulent cell is ever at @xmath152 at one time , it does all cascade down to @xmath152 over an eddy turnover time .",
    "thus , while @xmath279 is always small , the energy throughput can still be high enough to accelerate the electrons .",
    "the similarity in total energy between a single turbulent cell and an individual impulsive x - ray fragment strongly suggests that the two are related .",
    "@xcite estimates that as much as @xmath280 of the magnetic energy in a flare is available in the turbulence , which is sufficient to produce the high energy electrons inferred from the observed x - rays , but raises concerns about the efficiency of stfa , particularly in competition with other sources of dissipation .",
    "while we have not fully studied other dissipation mechanisms which might compete with stfa for this energy , three significant ones can be ruled out : proton acceleration by stfa , landau damping , and resistive dissipation of the turbulence .",
    "the latter two have already been discussed .",
    "proton acceleration is a significant concern since fermi acceleration of protons and heavy ions was in fact the very problem fermi intended to solve .",
    "thermal protons in coronal flare plasmas are sub - alfvenic and thus can not meet the condition for mirroring @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite argues convincingly that gyroresont interaction of protons and heavy ions with alfvn waves can accelerate them to velocities above @xmath22 on a relatively short time scale . within their model , the ions",
    "then are accelerated by compressive magnetosonic waves at the expense of electron acceleration .",
    "recent rhessi observations @xcite indicate that the emission signatures of ions and electrons are spatially separated , with the ion emission associated with longer loops .",
    "@xcite concluded that these observations are consistent with the gyroresonance model of ion acceleration ; as the loops grow longer , protons are more likely to reach super - alfvnic speeds , and thus can be accelerated by the magnetosonic waves .",
    "this second phase of acceleration need not be gyroresonant .",
    "while it appears promising , further study is required to determine if stfa models can accomodate these results .",
    "the strong dependence of the post - acceleration electron spectrum on the pitch angle scattering agent is both a positive and negative feature .",
    "it leaves stfa considerable flexibility in matching various characteristics of solar flare x - rays which fall outside of the simple scenario studied in this paper .",
    "for example , @xcite first observed a superhot component in a solar flare , which has since been supported by rhessi observations @xcite .",
    "this thermal , or nearly thermal , spectral component is seen at energies of up to @xmath239kev . within our stfa framework ,",
    "the superhot emission can easily be explained by an enhancement of pitch angle scattering at lower energies , either by increased whistler wave turbulence , or some other scattering agent .",
    "while this flexibility naturally allows for the wide range of flare characteristics observed , it does not yet definitively solve the flare acceleration problem .",
    "instead , it shifts the focus exclusively to a well constrained , but largely unspecified , array of pitch angle scattering mechanisms .",
    "this is the single greatest obstacle to stfa models of acceleration .    in short ,",
    "stfa can naturally account for the thermal spectrum below @xmath1kev , and somewhat less naturally for the non - thermal spectrum between @xmath1kev and @xmath2kev .",
    "there we have shown that @xmath152 must depend inversely on particle energy , in contrast to that of pitch angle scattering by whistler waves below @xmath260kev , which is proportional to the particle energy . above @xmath2kev ,",
    "shock acceleration is a natural possibility ; the needed injection of super - thermal electrons may be provided by stfa operating at energies below @xmath19 .",
    "the knee at @xmath2kev remains the most difficult spectral feature to accommodate , and we have explained the difficult requirements to pitch angle scattering that this demands .",
