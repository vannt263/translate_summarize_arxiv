    "heartbeat stars ( hbs ) , named after the resemblance between their light curves and an electrocardiogram , are binary or multiple systems with very eccentric orbits .",

    "the majority of hbs seem to have orbital period shorter than @xmath11 days .",
    "their range of effective temperatures ( @xmath12 k ) suggests that most of them are of spectral type earlier than g ( mostly g , f , and a ) .",
    "kic  3230227 ( hd181850 , bd+38 3544 ; @xmath13 , @xmath14=@xmath15:@xmath16:@xmath17 , @xmath18=@xmath19:@xmath20:@xmath21 ) is an eclipsing binary , first included in the _ kepler _ eb catalog by slawson et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and prsa et al .",

    "thompson et al .  ( 2012 ) studied light curves of 17 heartbeat stars , including kic  3230227 .",
    "thanks to the special light curves of hbs , they derived orbital parameters including the orbital inclination ( @xmath27 ) , eccentricity ( @xmath7 ) , and argument of periastron ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "armstrong et al .",
    "( 2014 ) derived the effective temperatures of @xmath29k and @xmath30k for the primary and secondary , respectively , by fitting the sed ( spectral energy distribution ) to the observed magnitudes .",

    "they also obtained abundances for many individual elements ( c , n , o , ne , na , mg , etc ) , as listed in their table 4 .",
    "most of these abundances are close to solar values ( asplund et al .  2009 ; lodders et al .",
    "we summarize the aforementioned results in table 1 .",
    "the orbital parameters of kic  3230227 were derived from radial velocity ( rv ) measurements in smullen & kobulnicky ( 2015 ) .",
    "this system was found to be composed of two a - type stars with similar masses ( mass ratio @xmath36 ) , and a very eccentric orbit ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) .",
    "these orbital elements are also listed in table 1 .",
    "four orbital elements ( @xmath8 , @xmath27 , @xmath7 , and @xmath28 ) were derived from the light curve alone by thompson et al .",
    "it is important to note that the kumar light curve model ( kumar et al .",
    "1995 ) adopted in thompson et al.s work does not take into account the effects of reflection and eclipses .",
    "the orbital parameters derived by fitting the light curve with the kumar model can be treated as good estimates , but they can also be off by a large margin , especially the orbital inclination if the reflection effect is important and/or eclipses occur .",
    "a better treatment of the light curve modeling of hbs was performed for the face - on system koi-54 by welsh et al .",
    "these authors modeled the light curve and radial velocity curve simultaneously , taking advantage of their binary modeling tool elc ( orosz & hauschildt 2000 ) .",
    "stellar distortions were fully modeled with the roche equipotential , and the reflection effect from mutual heating , plus the limb and gravity darkening effects are included . to synthesize the binary light curve ,",
    "nextgen atmosphere models are used to integrate numerically the flux from the stellar surface .",
    "several techniques are adopted in elc to improve the integration accuracy , for example , monte carlo sampling on the fractional pixels at the eclipse horizon with sobol sequences .",
    "here we use the same tool to model kic  3230227 .",
    "the _ kepler _ sap light curves were retrieved from mast .",
    "there are 18 quarters ( q ) of long cadence data ( q0 - 17 ) .",
    "short cadence light curves are only available from quarters 1 , 2 , and 5 .",
    "we de - trended the raw light curve in each quarter following the procedure detailed in guo et al .",
    "in short , the procedures include spline fitting to the long term trends , median difference corrections , outlier removal , and normalization .",
    "the de - trended light curves were then divided into six temporal sections and light curve modeling was performed for each section individually .",
    "obvious oscillations stand out in the light curves , and they are still present in the phase - folded light curves ( figure 2 , 4 ) .",
    "their amplitudes are low enough to be treated as perturbations to the binary light curve .",
    "we adopted the period in the _ kepler _ eclipsing binary catalog ( @xmath39 days ) , which is based on the analysis of light curve by using the lomb - scargle periodogram and _ kephem _ software ( hambleton et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "this system only shows a single , very narrow eclipse ( @xmath40 in phase ) near periastron . in order to model fully the shape of the eclipse",
    ", we have to use a very small increment in phase ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "this makes the light curve computation relatively expensive .",
    "aperture contamination parameters @xmath42 listed in kepler input catalog ( kic ) , which are the percent of contamination light from other stars in the photometric aperture , range from @xmath43 to @xmath44 . in elc , this effect is corrected by adding to the median value of the model light curve @xmath45 an offset @xmath46 . in practice , this effect is usually very small and negligible ( hambleton et al .",
    "2016 ) and we found no significant differences neglecting this effect .",
    "based on the effective temperatures listed in table 1 , the two components are likely to have radiative envelopes , thus the gravitational darkening coefficients @xmath47 and @xmath48 are set to the canonical values of @xmath49 ( von zeipel 1924 ) , and bolometric albedos @xmath50 are fixed to @xmath51 .    the rotational axis of the star is assumed to be aligned with the orbital angular momentum .",
    "we assume pseudo - synchronous rotation , which suggests the rotational frequency satisfies @xmath52f_{\\rm orb}$ ] ( hut 1981 ) ( @xmath53 for @xmath1 ) .",
    "claret & gimenez ( 1993 ) showed that early - type binaries exhibit a considerable tendency towards pseudo - synchronism up to @xmath54 . for kic3230227 , a / r=11.76 , and",
    "so pseudo - synchronous is a reasonable assumption and it also roughly agrees with the measured @xmath55 .",
    "we proceed here and in section 3 assuming spin - orbit aligned pseudo - synchronous rotation , but caution that different spin rates / obliquities are possible .",
    "we use the orbital eccentricity @xmath56 and argument of periastron @xmath57 from smullen & kobulnicky ( 2015 ) as initial values . the mass ratio @xmath58 and primary semi - amplitude velocity @xmath59 , taken from the same paper ,",
    "are initially fixed to @xmath60 and @xmath61 km s@xmath35 , respectively .",
    "it is well known that the light curves of eclipsing binaries are sensitive to the temperature ratio rather than individual temperatures .",
    "thus the effective temperature of the primary @xmath62 is fixed to @xmath63k , in agreement with the spectroscopic results in table 1 .",
    "we fit the light curve by optimizing the following parameters : @xmath7 , @xmath28 , @xmath27 , relative radius @xmath64 and @xmath65 , time of periastron passage @xmath66 , and effective temperature of the secondary @xmath67 .",
    "the search for the @xmath68 minimum was performed with the genetic algorithm _ pikaia _ ( charbonneau 1995 ) , followed by a local search with the downhill simplex algorithm _ amoeba_. since elc does not model pulsations in the light curve , the standard way of estimating uncertainties by finding the range of parameters that increases @xmath68 by 1.0 from @xmath69 can not be used .",
    "instead , we adopted the standard deviations of the best - fitting parameters in the six data sets as the @xmath70 errors .",
    "this is the method used by guo et al .",
    "( 2016 ) , and it can account for possible systematic uncertainties due to light curve de - trending .",
    "the final optimized solution has essentially the same @xmath7 and @xmath28 values as those in the rv work of smullen & kobulnicky ( 2015 ) .",
    "the orbital inclination ( @xmath71 ) , however , is much larger than the result in thompson et al .",
    "( 2012 ) ( @xmath72 ) , and close to that in smullen & kobulnicky ( 2015 ) ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "as shown in figure 2 , our light curve model matches the observations down to the level of @xmath74 magnitude .",
    "the profile of the narrow eclipse is also well modeled .",
    "the secondary has a slightly higher effective temperature @xmath75 and smaller mass and radius ( @xmath76 ) , compared to that of the primary ( @xmath77k , @xmath78 ) .",
    "the main parameters of our elc model are listed in table 2 .",
    "the projected rotational velocities ( @xmath79 km s@xmath35 , @xmath80 km s@xmath35 ) , under the assumption of pseudo - synchronous rotation , are in approximate agreement with the measured @xmath55 from spectra as listed in table 1 .",
    "we found that the best - fit light curve solution from one data set or quarter can almost match the light curve of other quarters equally well . in terms of argument of periastron",
    "@xmath28 , no discernable apsidal motion was found .",
    "the flux - weighted radial velocity curves from our elc model are shown in figure 3 , matching the original rv measurements in smullen & kobulnicky ( 2015 ) very well . in the right two panels",
    ", we also show the predicted rossiter - mclaughlin effect during the eclipse .",
    "it can be seen that in order to measure this effect , an rv precision better than @xmath81 km s@xmath35 is needed .",
    "to study the pulsations , we obtained the residuals by subtracting the best binary light curve model from the observations .",
    "figure 4 illustrates the pulsational light curve in q14 , together with the original binary light curve in q14 and the short cadence light curve in q5 .",
    "we then calculated the fourier spectrum by using the _ period_@xmath82 package ( lenz & breger 2005 ) .",
    "a standard pre - whitening procedure was performed for the spectrum in each quarter , which means repeating iteratively the following steps : fitting a sinusoid to the data , subtracting this optimized fit from the data , and computing the fourier spectrum of the residuals .",
    "the fitting formula used is @xmath83 , where @xmath84 are the zero - point shift , amplitudes of pulsations , frequencies , and phases , respectively .",
    "the time @xmath85 is with respect to the periastron passage : @xmath86 bjd @xmath87 .",
    "the calculation was performed to the long nyquist frequency ( @xmath88 d@xmath35 ) .",
    "a similar calculation was performed with the short cadence residuals as well , but no peaks were found beyond the frequency @xmath89 d@xmath35 in the spectrum .",
    "the strong pulsational frequencies are actually all below @xmath90 d@xmath35 .",
    "the amplitude spectrum calculated from residuals of quarter 1 only and from quarters @xmath91 are shown in figure 5 .",
    "the dominant feature in the spectrum is the equal spacing of the frequency peaks .",
    "the main pulsational frequencies and their amplitudes and phases are listed in table 3 .",
    "the uncertainties are calculated following kallinger et al .",
    "we have labeled them as @xmath92 to @xmath93 , in the order of increasing frequency .",
    "a close examination reveals that most of these peaks are exact integer multiples of orbital frequency ( @xmath94d@xmath35 ) , for instance , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath93 .",
    "the orbital harmonic nature of the pulsational frequencies , together with the high eccentricity of the binary and the masses of the stars strongly suggest that these are tidally induced pulsations .",
    "note that the two non - orbital - harmonic frequencies @xmath92 , @xmath101 can be added together to obtain an orbital harmonic ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "the same phenomenon was also found in the tidal oscillations frequencies of koi-54 .",
    "this can be explained by non - linear mode coupling as detailed by burkart et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , oleary & burkart ( 2014 ) , and weinberg et al .",
    "it is also interesting to note that @xmath103 and @xmath104 have the same fraction to the nearest orbital harmonic .",
    "the feature that nonharmonic frequencies share the common fractional parts in units of orbital frequency was discussed in detail by oleary & burkart ( 2014 ) for koi-54 .",
    "this further supports the interpretation of these frequencies as the result of non - linear mode coupling .",
    "note that we focus on the significant frequencies ( @xmath105 ) that appear both in the spectra of single - quarter data and all - quarter data .",
    "other tidally induced pulsations with low amplitudes could also exist .",
    "for example , the peaks at @xmath106 d@xmath35 and @xmath107 d@xmath35 are @xmath90 and @xmath108 times the orbital frequency , respectively .",
    "many frequency triplets can be seen in the spectrum , with equal spacing of orbital frequency .",
    "close examination reveals that all these triplets have frequencies that are equal to @xmath109 times orbital frequency .",
    "thus they can be explained as a combination of one real oscillation peak and two side - lobes due to the spectral window ( figure 5 ) .",
    "the nonharmonic peaks @xmath110 generate side - lobes at @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "we find that after pre - whitening @xmath113 , and @xmath114 , these triplets essentially disappear , and only @xmath115 peaks remain , supporting the above argument .",
    "low amplitude @xmath116 modes can also exist . at high inclination ,",
    "these modes are expected to have low amplitudes . as discussed below , the ledoux constant @xmath117 ( ledoux 1951 )",
    "is about @xmath118 for the @xmath119-modes in the observed frequency range .",
    "this means the splitting @xmath120 is about @xmath121 for modes with frequencies much higher than @xmath122 .",
    "if we adopt pseudo - synchronous rotation @xmath123 d@xmath35 , @xmath120 are then @xmath124 and @xmath125 d@xmath35 for @xmath126 and @xmath127 , respectively .",
    "thus the splittings will be located at several orbital harmonics away from their central @xmath116 peak .",
    "this also suggests that the splittings are not due to rotation .",
    "the amplitude variations of these oscillations are shown in figure 6 and listed in table 4 .",
    "most of the frequencies have relatively stable amplitudes over 16 quarters , with variations less than @xmath128 milli - mag .",
    "the exception seems to be @xmath95 , which decreased from @xmath129 milli - mag in q1 to @xmath130 milli - mag in q16 .      for tidally induced oscillations in kic 3230227",
    ", it is sufficient to consider only the dominant @xmath131 term since higher order terms are at most @xmath132 times ( an order of magnitude ) smaller than the @xmath131 term ( eq . 8 in burkart",
    "et al .  2012 ) .",
    "additionally , the observed amplitudes of higher order modes ( @xmath133 ) are reduced by geometrical cancelation upon integration over the stellar surface , so we expect their contribution to the pulsation spectrum to be small .",
    "phases of tidal oscillations contain important information on the mode properties .",
    "oleary & burkart ( 2014 ) identified the two dominant pulsations in koi-54 as @xmath134 modes by studying their phases .",
    "following their treatment , for standing modes , the phases of observed flux variation ( @xmath135 ) due to tidal oscillations that have @xmath136 times the orbital frequency are :    @xmath137    where , @xmath138 is the mode amplitude for the @xmath136th orbital harmonic ( eq . @xmath139 in burkart et al .",
    "2012 ) and ( @xmath140 are observer s coordinates .",
    "since we express the pulsations with the formula @xmath141 instead of cosine functions , the observed phases ( @xmath142 ) in units of @xmath143 are then : @xmath144 and    @xmath145    where @xmath146 rad is the argument of periastron from the rv and light curve analysis . in the limit of poor tuning ,",
    "that is , the difference between intrinsic mode frequency of free oscillations and the nearest orbital harmonics ( @xmath147 ) is much larger than mode damping rate ( @xmath148 ) , @xmath149 , we have the following approximation , @xmath150/(2\\pi)=\\left[\\pi/2-\\pi/2\\right]/(2\\pi)=0\\ ] ] the observed phase is then @xmath151    note that if using the magnitude variation , the phase will be off by @xmath152 ( by @xmath153 if in units of @xmath143 ) , since @xmath154 . in figure 7 , we show the observed phases of main oscillations . within uncertainties , phases of @xmath155 can be explained by the theoretical phases of @xmath6 modes ( @xmath156 ) .",
    "the phase of @xmath114 is close to the predicted phase of @xmath127 modes ( @xmath157 ) .",
    "thus most of the observed oscillations are likely due to @xmath158 modes , in agreement with the expectations for the high inclination angle of the binary ( @xmath159 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath134 modes are expected to have low amplitudes , and none of the main frequencies have phases close to those predicted phases ( @xmath160 ) .",
    "we do not have strong evidence that the oscillations are in resonance locking , because amplitudes of resonance - locked modes are much larger than normal tidal oscillations ( see the amplitude modeling below ) .",
    "we want to study whether the observed amplitudes of tidal oscillations agree with theory . to this end",
    ", we evolve a star of @xmath161 with solar metallicity with mesa evolution code ( paxton et al .  2011 , 2013 ) until its properties match the observations of the primary .",
    "the closest equilibrium model has the same radius ( @xmath162 ) , but slightly cooler effective temperature ( @xmath163k vs. @xmath164k ) .",
    "we use parameters of the secondary ( @xmath165 ) for the calculation of tidal forcing from the companion .",
    "following fuller & lai ( 2012 ) , the lagrangian tidal displacement @xmath166 can be expressed as the sum of displacement of free oscillations @xmath167 ,    @xmath168    where @xmath169 represents the mode indices which include ( @xmath170 ) .",
    "the amplitude of each mode @xmath171 is derived from solving the forced harmonic oscillator equation ( their eq .",
    "22 ) , and the solution is given by their eq .",
    "the expression of @xmath172 involves the sum over the forcing from each orbital harmonic @xmath136 , and this is from the fourier expansion of orbital motion in the eccentric orbit ( their eq .",
    "the displacement @xmath173 and various other eigenfunctions of @xmath134 modes are calculated with the gyre code ( townsend & teitler 2013 ) in the non - adiabatic mode .",
    "we use the updated collocation method colloc_gl2 to solve the oscillation equations which has better performance than the magnus solver for non - adiabatic calculations .",
    "we use the perturbative approximation which is valid when ( angular ) rotation frequency @xmath174 is much smaller than mode frequency ( co - rotating frame ) in the zero - rotation limit ( @xmath175 ) .",
    "the frequencies of @xmath6 prograde modes are calculated from @xmath176 .",
    "the mode eigenfunctions are normalized to have unit mode inertia and assumed to be unchanged by rotation .",
    "following buta & smith ( 1979 ) , the magnitude variation of a single oscillation mode due to temperature changes has the following expression assuming pulsations are adiabatic : @xmath177\\gamma_{l } \\",

    "the variations due to the equilibrium tide ( setting @xmath189 ) have been subtracted .",
    "the result is shown in figure 8 , together with the observed amplitudes of oscillations .",
    "the predicted mode amplitudes are very sensitive to the mode detuning parameter @xmath190 , i.e. , the difference between the intrinsic mode frequency @xmath191 and driving frequency @xmath192 .",
    "there is a strong peak at @xmath193 , which is due to a chance resonance ( very small @xmath194 ) for the stellar model that we use . a stellar equilibrium model with almost the same observed parameters (",
    "radius , temperature , and mass ) and slightly different mode frequencies will have quite different mode detuning .",
    "detailed amplitude modeling requires very fine grids of structure models and is beyond the scope of this paper ( see burkart et al .",
    "2012 ) . but",
    "overall , the theoretical predicted mode amplitudes seem to agree with observations .",
