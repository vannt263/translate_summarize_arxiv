    "to establish integrability of a nonlinear partial differential equation in the sense of soliton theory  @xcite , at least in two dimensions , one usually looks for a zero curvature representation ( zcr )  @xcite , possibly in the form of a lax pair  @xcite .",
    "if depending on a non - removable ( spectral ) parameter , a zcr may serve as a starting point of methods to derive infinitely many independent conservation laws and large classes of exact solutions .",
    "however , certain zcr s do not imply integrability because of specific degeneracy , which does not even rule out possible dependence on one or more nonremovable parameters .",
    "e.g. , calogero and nucci  @xcite gave a formula to assign a lax pair to any nonlinear system possessing a single conservation law , arguing that such systems are too abundant to be all integrable .",
    "recently sakovich  @xcite observed that the calogero ",
    "nucci examples can be singled out by properties of their associated cyclic bases .",
    "in particular , the ` bad ' zcr s fail to generate an integrable hierarchy .",
    "in this paper we postulate that a zcr is degenerate if it takes values in a solvable lie algebra or is gauge equivalent to such . even though some researchers are inclined to admit the relevance of such zcr s to integrability , our results below seem to support the opposite opinion .    zcr",
    "s taking values in an abelian algebra are well known to be equivalent to a set of local conservation laws ( see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "3.2.c ) ) . using the lie theorem on finite - dimensional representations of solvable algebras , we show in sect .  4 rather easily that every zcr that takes values in a solvable algebra is equivalent to a ` chain ' of nonlocal conservation laws .",
    "this simple result renders , e.g. , attempts to generate infinitely many independent conservation laws out of a degenerate zcr rather unrealistic .    in sect .",
    "[ reducibility ] we address the problem of detecting reducibility of a zcr to a subalgebra , in particular , to a solvable one .",
    "purely algebraic criteria are insufficient since the lie algebra a zcr takes values in may be altered by gauge transformation . on the other hand , when trying to find the reducing gauge matrix directly , we face a rather large underdetermined differential system . our idea is to employ an appropriate matrix decomposition , namely , the gram or gauss decomposition .",
    "earlier these decompositions were applied by dodd and paul  @xcite in the context of bcklund transformations .",
    "a remarkable connection between decompositions and integrable systems emerged in numerical analysis @xcite .",
    "the last section is devoted to recursion operators , direct and inverse , for symmetries of integrable systems  @xcite . in",
    "olver s  @xcite formalism , a recursion operator is a linear integro - differential operator @xmath0 , which maps symmetries to symmetries . the standard way of inverting @xmath0 consists in finding differential operators @xmath1 such that @xmath2 ; then @xmath3 .",
    "however , one encounters the problem of writing the inverse @xmath4 as an integro - differential operator . in the scalar case ,",
    "@xmath5 may be put in the form @xmath6 , where the coefficients @xmath7 are expressible as quotients of wronskians of independent solutions @xmath8 of @xmath9 ( see  @xcite for a simple derivation of this classical result , equivalent to decomposability into first - order factors ; see @xcite for the matrix case ) . in our context , @xmath7 are nonlocal functions and finding them is considered to be the most difficult part of the whole procedure . once @xmath7 are found",
    ", one can invert @xmath5 simply as @xmath10 .",
    "this is essentially the general scheme behind the works  @xcite .",
    "guthrie s  @xcite recursion operators resemble bcklund autotransformations for the linearized system and indeed can be interpreted this way ( see  @xcite ) ; their inversion is quite straightforward and does not require the introduction of new nonlocalities .",
    "moreover , guthrie s operators do not suffer from the known abnormities , related to the fact that @xmath11 fails to hold  ( @xcite ) .",
    "let us also remind the reader that computing the ` inverse ' guthrie operator starting from a known zcr may turn out to be easier than computing the ` direct ' one ( see  @xcite ) . the conversion from olver s to guthrie s form was explained by guthrie  @xcite himself , the result being further strengthened by sergyeyev  @xcite . concerning the backward conversion ,",
    "the @xmath12-part of a guthrie operator can be written as an integro - differential operator if the zcr underlying it is lower triangular .",
    "a non - parametric zcr can be made lower triangular at the cost of the introduction of appropriate nonlocalities .",
    "to introduce only few ( respected ) nonlocalities , we take into account a particular observation ( already exploited in  @xcite ) about the structure of guthrie s recursion operators of integrable systems .",
    "let @xmath13 be a system of nonlinear partial differential equations ( pde ) @xmath14 on a number of functions @xmath15 in two independent variables @xmath16 .",
    "here each @xmath17 is a smooth function depending on a finite number of variables @xmath18 , @xmath19 ,  , where @xmath20 stands for a symmetric multiindex over the two - element set of indices @xmath21 . besides the _ local _",
    "variables @xmath22 , we shall also need non - local variables or pseudopotentials  @xcite , which may be introduced as additional variables satisfying a system of equations @xmath23 where @xmath24 are functions depending on a finite number of local variables as well as the pseudopotentials @xmath25 ; we require that the system  ( [ z ] ) be compatible as a consequence of ( [ eq ] ) .    within their geometric theory of systems of pde s , krasilshchik and",
    "vinogradov  @xcite introduced the notion of a covering , which separates the invariant content of nonlocality from its coordinate presentation .",
    "pseudopotentials then correspond to a particular but arbitrary choice of coordinates along the fibres of the covering in question .",
