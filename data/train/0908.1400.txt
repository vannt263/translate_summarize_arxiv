    "this hole behaves like a charged particle , much like the electron , though with a substantially larger effective mass . because the valence states are derived from p - type atomic states of the lattice , a hole experiences a strong spin - orbit ( so ) interaction that leads to a new spin basis in which the low energy hole state has total angular momentum @xmath0 .",
    "because light hole ( lh ) states ( @xmath1 ) are shifted to larger energy by confinement and strain , it is generally a good approximation to treat low - energy holes in qds as if they have only heavy - hole ( hh ) ( @xmath2 ) character with a pseudo - spin @xmath3 .",

    "when two inas qds are stacked on top of one another , electrons or holes can tunnel between the two dots to create quantum dot molecules ( qdms).@xcite in general the tunnel coupling is weak because the natural distribution of dot size , shape , and alloying leads to different confined energy levels in each dot .",
    "an electric field applied along the growth direction can tune the energy levels into resonance to enable coherent tunneling of electrons or holes between the dots and the formation of delocalized states with molecular orbital character.@xcite the experimental signature of the delocalized molecular orbitals is the formation of an anticrossing between photoluminescence ( pl ) lines that come from direct ( electron and hole in the same quantum dot ) and indirect ( electron and hole in different quantum dots ) states .",

    "[ excitonenergy]b ) .",
    "the node in the molecular wavefunction suppresses the contribution of the gaas barrier to the net hole g factor . because the barrier hole g factor is positive , suppression of this contribution increases the relative weight of the negative g factor contribution from the inas qds .",

    "conversely , the higher energy molecular states have symmetric ( node - less ) orbital character ( upper inset ) .",

    "the explanation of all of these complex anticrossing patterns by the inclusion of a single term in the matrix hamiltonians provides strong phenomenological evidence for the existence of hole spin mixing . in the next section",
    "we will address the physical origin of such a mixing term in the misalignment of qds along the stacking axis .",

    "that do not show hole spin mixing , it is possible to measure each parameter independently in order to construct a quantitatively reasonably matrix hamiltonian or to fit a single undetermined parameter . in this case , the hole spin mixing is of the same order of magnitude as spin - conserving tunneling , electron - hole exchange and the resonant change in g factor .",
    "consequently it is impossible to determine each parameter independently or to obtain a quantitative fit to all parameters simultaneously .",
    "this limitation manifests in the suppression of the spin - conserving tunneling rate @xmath29 .",
    "lateral offset between the qds is expected to suppress the tunneling rate and the reversal of molecular orbitals predicts that the tunneling rate should be very small for barrier thicknesses near those of this sample.@xcite a very small tunneling rate is therefore entirely plausible but the limitations of our model do not allow us to be more quantitative .",
    "we conclude this section with a discussion of the extent of the experimental evidence for the presence of the hole spin mixing term .",

    "preliminary work indicates that the effect is much smaller in a sample with a 6 nm barrier .",
    "the experimental data presented in fig.[exptholemix]b and e provides a striking and clear example of the contributions of the hole spin mixing term because the tunneling term is unusually small .",
    "this small tunneling rate is consistent with , but not proof of , a lateral misalignment between dots .",
    "we find additional experimental confirmation of the existence of a hole spin mixing term in the magneto - pl spectra of the positively charged trion ( not shown ) .",
    "the excited state of the positive trion contains two hole spins , which can be in a triplet configuration when the holes are in separate dots .",
    "the hole spin mixing again introduces new anticrossings in the experimental spectra , in this case between the triplet states and singlet states that have both holes in the same dot .",
    "the additional anticrossings that appear in both the neutral exciton and positive trion spectra are enabled by the hole spin mixing term , which allows spin - flip tunneling .",
    "the spin - flip tunneling can be seen in the phenomenological hamiltonian ( eq .  ( [ matrixhamiltonian ] ) ) : the hole spin mixing term connects eigenstates that have holes in different dots with different spin orientations .",
    "although we can model the observed data with the addition of a phenomenological spin mixing term , the question of the physical origin of such a term remains . in analogy with single qds , one might suspect rashba and dresselhaus so interactions.@xcite however the large magnitude of the spin anticrossing gap in fig .",

    "we have used a phenomenological matrix hamiltonian to demonstrate that the inclusion of hole spin mixing qualitatively explains all of the new anticrossings in the experimental data .",
    "we have then used a k@xmath67p theory to show that molecular symmetry breaking in the form of qd lateral offset changes the mixing of hh and lh states and enables the same form of hole spin mixing .",
    "the combination of experimental evidence and k@xmath67p theory lead us to the conclusion that hole spin mixing can occur in qdms as a result of symmetry breaking .",
    "a quantitative understanding of the spin mixing term will require detailed experiments in which the molecular symmetry can be broken in a quantifiable way .",

    "the contributions of the other spinor components may enable additional decoherence or dephasing mechanisms that limit the ability to store and manipulate quantum information , as well as the preparation of pure spin hole states through the positive trion@xcite .",
    "these mechanisms could be suppressed by minimizing the structural distortions that break the molecular symmetries or by designing spin storage and manipulation protocols that are insensitive to the mixing of additional hole spin components .",
    "away from the anticrossing points , the hh spin projections remain relatively pure and viable for quantum information storage .",
    "the spin mixing mechanism we describe here is reminiscent of that reported by ferreira and bastard for single asymmetric quantum wells.@xcite holes in symmetric quantum wells have a well defined pseudo - spin in spite of the hh - lh coupling because the parity symmetry prevents undesired mixing between spinors.@xcite introducing envelope function asymmetries that break the parity bring about a dyakanov - perel - like mechanism of spin relaxation.@xcite in our qdm system , the vertical parity symmetry is lifted by the lens - shaped confinement and the different composition of the dots .",
    "still , this does not suffice to mix pseudo - spins because the lateral confinement , which is obviously absent in quantum wells , imposes an additional symmetry , namely circular symmetry . as a result ,",
    "the `` spin up '' and `` spin down '' hole states have different total angular momenta @xmath63 and they remain orthogonal . in order to mix the orthogonal spin projections ,",
    "one has to break the rotational symmetry .",

    "the envelope origin of the so term we report suggests that it can be controlled with external field , and hence used in a similar fashion to the rashba term for spintronic applications.@xcite indeed , the magnitude of the spin anticrossing gaps observed in fig .  [ exptholemix](e ) are comparable to those of electrons in inas qdms with strong rashba interaction.@xcite this makes holes in qdms particularly suitable for electric - field - induced spin manipulation .",
    "for example , two orthogonal spin states of the hole in the bottom qd could provide the qubit basis . away from the electric field of tunnel coupling and hole spin mixing , these states are well isolated and could provide a robust means of storing quantum information.@xcite the applied electric field could then be varied to bring the dots into the regime where hole spin mixing becomes strong in order to mix the two spin configurations . a detailed examination of the interaction strengths and electric field pulse sequences required to effect a single qubit rotation are beyond the scope of this paper",
    "if feasible , however , such a scheme would require fewer resources to implement spin control protocols than current proposals .",
    "spin rotations could be implemented with only a single applied electric field , eliminating the need for pulsed lasers tuned to transitions specific to each dot or ghz frequency fields used to implement g - tmr rotations of spin projections.@xcite at the same time , the qdm structure preserves the opportunity to use optics for spin initialization , readout and control of 2-qubit operations .",
