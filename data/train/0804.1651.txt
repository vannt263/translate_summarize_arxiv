    "the study of strongly correlated electron systems has become in the last decade one of the most active fields of condensed matter physics .",
    "one of the most important models of strongly correlated electrons is the anderson impurity model ( aim)@xmath0}$ ] .",
    "it is a model of the system of free conduction electrons that interact with the system of the electrons of the @xmath1 or @xmath2 shells of impurity atoms .",
    "the impurity electrons are strongly correlated because of strong coulomb repulsion and they undergo the hybridization with conduction electrons .",
    "this model has been largely applied to heavy fermion systems where the local impurity orbital is @xmath2 orbital @xmath3}$ ] .",
    "the interest towards the anderson impurity model has also increased with the advent of dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) within which an infinite dimensional lattice models can be mapped onto effective impurity models by using self - consistency conditions@xmath4}$ ] .",
    "this model has also been intensively investigated by using the method of equation of motion for retarded and advanced green s functions proposed by bogoliubov and tiablikov @xmath5}$ ] and developed in papers @xmath6}$ ] .",
    "we propose a diagrammatic method to treat the aim which is an alternative approach to the equations of motion and renormalization methods@xmath7}$ ] .",
    "the first attempt to develop the diagrammatic theory for this problem was realized in the paper@xmath8}$ ] .",
    "these authors used the expansion by cumulants for averages of products of hubbard transfer operators and their algebra .",
    "afterwards , other diagrammatic techniques dealing with perturbation in the hybridization amplitude while keeping the on - site correlation exact have been developed@xmath9}$ ] . here",
    "we use the thermodynamic perturbation theory and matsubara @xmath10}$ ] green s functions , considering the hybridization of both groups of electrons as a perturbation .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model is written as @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 - annihilation ( creation ) operators of conduction and impurity electrons with spin @xmath14correspondingly , @xmath15 is the kinetic energy of the conduction band state @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the local energy of @xmath18 electrons , @xmath19 is the on - site coulomb repulsion of the impurity electrons and @xmath20 the number of lattice sites .",
    "both energies are evaluated with respect to the chemical potential @xmath21 of the system .",
    "the perturbation @xmath22 is the hybridization interaction between conduction and localized electrons .",
    "the coulomb repulsion between impurity electrons is far to large to be treated as perturbation and it must be included in the main part of hamiltonian @xmath23 . the existence of this term invalidates the wick theorem for local electrons . therefore first of all we formulate the generalized wick theorem ( gwt ) for local electrons preserving the ordinary wick theorem for conduction electrons .",
    "our ( gwt ) really is the identity which determines the irreducible green s functions or the kubo cumulants .    for example",

    "the right -hand part of equation ( 2 ) contains the first two terms which are the ordinary wick contributions and last one named by us as irreducible green s function or kubo cumulant which contains spin , charge and pairing fluctuations of localized electrons . in case",
    "when the statistical average of operators contains 6 operators @xmath27 , the right - hand part contains @xmath28 terms with product of three one - particle green s functions , then there are nine terms in the form of product of one - particle green s function and two - particle irreducible function . at last",

    "the zero order hamiltonian of the localized electrons can be diagonalized by using the hubbard transfer operators @xmath33 @xmath34}$ ] . by using these operators",
    "it is possible to calculate the simplest irreducible green s functions .",
    "the full one - particle matsubara green s function of localized electrons in interaction representation has the form : @xmath35 where the index @xmath36 means connected diagrams .",
    "the operators are taken in the interaction representation , @xmath37 is chronological operator .    for conduction electrons",
    "it is convenient to define the local operator @xmath38 the corresponding full conduction electron green s function has the form @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the evolution operator @xmath41 because the matrix element of hybridization @xmath42 is absorbed by local operator @xmath43 it is convenient to introduce a new parameter @xmath44 , which will be associated to each vertex of the diagrams . in such a way",
    "the order of perturbation theory will be determined by @xmath44 and not by the matrix element @xmath42 of hybridization which can be present even in zero order green s function . in the last stage of the calculation @xmath44",
    "will be put equal to one .    in zero order of perturbation theory",
    "the fourier representation of these functions are ( @xmath45 ) : @xmath46 } { z_{0 } } , \\\\ z_{0}&=&1 + 2\\exp ( -\\beta \\epsilon _ { f})+\\exp \\left [ -\\beta ( 2\\epsilon _ { f}+u \\right ] .\\nonumber\\label{7}\\ \\ ] ] here @xmath47 are the matsubara odd frequencies .    for the conduction electrons we have @xmath48 the presence in the definition of zero order green s function @xmath49 of the square of matrix element of hybridization is the consequence of our equation ( 4 ) and not of the perturbation .",
    "the thermodynamical perturbation theory gives us the results for one - particle green s functions presented on the fig.1 and fig.2 .",
    "the double solid and dashed lines depict the renormalized and the thin lines the bar propagators of conduction and impurity electrons .",
    "the lines connect the crosses which depict the impurity states .",
    "to crosses are attached two arrows one of which is ingoing and one outgoing .",

    "the rectangles with @xmath53 indices and crosses depict the irreducible @xmath30 $ ] green s functions .",
    "the sign of diagrams is determined by the parity ( even or odd ) of the permutation of the fermi operators necessary to obtain the diagram .            using feynman s rules and the correspondence above",
    ", it is possible to establish the next equation for the diagrams shown in fig.1 :    @xmath54    on the basis of the diagrams depicted on the fig.2 , instead it is possible to establish the following dyson s type equation for @xmath55 :    @xmath56    where @xmath57 here @xmath58 is the new correlation function which contains an infinite sum of the irreducible green s functions . as it was underlined above this function contains all spin , charge and pairing fluctuations and is the main element of our diagram technique .",
    "diagram representation of the correlation function @xmath59 is depicted on the fig.3        the series expansion of the full propagator @xmath60 can gives us more detailed representation of this quantity .    by using the fourier representation of matsubara functions on the base of equations ( 9)and ( 10 ) ,",
    "we have : @xmath61 @xmath62 the equation ( 12 ) for conduction electron propagator is the dyson one with mass operator determined by the correlation function of impurity electrons : @xmath63 when @xmath44 is equal to one these quantities coincide .",

    "the thermodynamic potential of our strongly correlated system is equal to @xmath65 ,   \\nonumber \\label{15 } \\ ] ] the diagrams which determine the mean value of the evolution operator @xmath66 have not external lines and are named vacuum diagrams",
    ". between such diagrams there are connected and disconnected ones .",
    "the disconnected diagrams can be summed and the result of such summation is equal to the exponent of connected diagrams .",
    "the result of such summation permits us to formulate linked cluster theorem .",
    "it has the form : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the infinite sum of vacuum connected diagrams .",
    "this quantity is equal to zero when hybridization is absent .",
    "therefore thermodynamic potential is equal to @xmath69 in fig.4 are depicted some of the simplest vacuum diagrams .",
    "the first three diagrams are of chain type and are originated from the ordinary wick contributions .",
    "the last three diagrams contain the correlation functions and are determined by the new contributions of gwt .",
    "the factor @xmath70 , where @xmath31 is the perturbation theory order , present in these diagrams makes it difficult to carry out the summation over @xmath31 . as is usual in such cases @xmath71}$ ] we employ a trick , that of integrating over the interacting strength @xmath44 .",
    "the result of this procedure is depicted in fig.5 .",
    "now we shall use the diagrams of the conduction electron propagator @xmath72 depicted on the fig.1 and these of @xmath73 from fig.3 to combine them in such a way to obtain the vacuum diagrams of fig.5 .",
    "either diagrams of fig.5 of the @xmath31 order of perturbation theory can be considered as the product of the contribution of order @xmath74 from @xmath72 and of the contribution of order @xmath75 from @xmath73 with the condition that @xmath76 .",
    "there are in general case different possibilities to arrange such contribution and the number of these possibilities is determined by the numerator of the fraction before the diagrams of fig.5 .",
    "the denominator of this fraction is determined from fig.4 .",
    "therefore we obtain    @xmath77    the thermodynamical potential becomes equal to @xmath78 from this equation we obtain : @xmath79 the expression ( 19 ) for thermodynamical potential contains additional integration over the interaction strength @xmath44 and is awkward because of it .",
    "as was proved for non correlated many - electron system by luttinger and ward @xmath71}$ ] this expression can be transformed into a much more convenient formula .",
    "we consider the following expression :    @xmath80 + g_{\\sigma } ( i\\omega |\\lambda ) \\sigma_{\\sigma } ( i\\omega |\\lambda ) \\}+ y ^{\\prime } , \\label{21 } \\ ] ]    which is the generalization of the luttinger - ward equation for strongly correlated systems . here",
    "@xmath81 is the sum of closed linked skeleton diagrams with full @xmath72 function as a contribution of conduction electron lines .    on the fig.6",
    "are depicted some of simplest skeleton diagrams .",
    "these diagrams depend on the interaction strength @xmath44 not only through the factors in front of each diagram but also through the full green s function @xmath82 .    from equations ( 12 ) , ( 14 ) and ( 21 ) we obtain @xmath83 where , from fig.3,6 and definition ( 14 ) , it follows that @xmath84 as a result we obtain the stationary property with respect to changes of the mass operator : @xmath85 now we shall find the quantity @xmath86 . by the stationary property of @xmath87 we can ignore the dependence of @xmath88 and @xmath89 on @xmath44 and",
    "take into account only the explicit dependence of @xmath44 in @xmath90 , depicted on the fig.6 . from this figure",
    "it is easy to obtain : @xmath91 from equations ( 20 ) and ( 25 ) we obtain @xmath92 the consequence of this equation is the solution @xmath93 for @xmath94 we have @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "therefore @xmath97 .",
    "the final result has the form @xmath98",
    "the thermodynamic potential of a strongly correlated system described by the anderson impurity model has been calculated .",
    "we have formulated a new diagrammatic technique for fermions with strong correlations and determined the correlation function of localized electrons and mass operator of conduction electrons . for the conduction electrons this operator coincides with the correlation function of the impurity electrons . a dyson s type of equation for the one - particle propagators of both subsystems , of conduction and impurity electrons , has been established . within our diagrammatic technique",
    "we first obtained an exact expression for the thermodynamic potential as a product of the full propagator @xmath72 of the conduction electrons and its mass operator @xmath99 , then a luttinger - ward - type @xmath71}$ ] of identity based on the stationary property of the potential was established .",
    "the expression for the thermodynamic potential so obtained could be very useful to calculate in a systematic way all thermodynamic quantities ( e.g. specific heat ) of strongly correlated electron systems .",
