    "the study of high - frequency collective dynamics in liquids and glasses at microscopic length scales and terahertz frequency region has been a subject of intense investigations in the past decade . in particular , recent development of the inelastic x - ray scattering ( ixs )",
    "technique has renewed the interest in a long - standing issue of sound propagation  @xcite .",
    "it is now generally accepted that a well - defined sound - like oscillatory mode  called the high - frequency or fast sound  is supported in liquids outside the strict hydrodynamic region , down to wavelengths of a few interparticle distances , but with a sound velocity larger than the hydrodynamic value .",
    "traditionally , such increase of the sound velocity upon increase of the wave number  called the anomalous or positive dispersion  has been interpreted within the so - called viscoelastic model  @xcite . in this model ,",
    "relevant memory kernel in the zwanzig - mori or memory - function equation for the dynamics structure factor @xmath0 is modeled by an exponential function with a single time constant @xmath1 reflecting structural relaxation in liquids .",
    "an increase of the sound velocity is predicted at the wave number @xmath2 where the condition @xmath3 is fulfilled with the resonance frequency @xmath4 of the dynamic structure factor .",
    "this condition marks the transition from the low - frequency viscous behavior to the high - frequency elastic behavior of the liquid , and thus , the positive dispersion effect is ascribed to the transition between a liquid - like to a solid - like response of the system .    according to the viscoelastic model , the absence of the positive dispersion",
    "is naturally expected in glasses where the structural relaxation is basically frozen .",
    "however , molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations have demonstrated the presence of the positive dispersion in model glasses  @xcite .",
    "a first experimental confirmation has been reported recently from an ixs study on vitreous silica  @xcite .",
    "the observed anomalous dispersion implies the presence of some additional `` relaxation '' process which is active even in glasses , and stimulates an extension of the viscoelastic model to fully account for the anomalies present both in liquids and glasses .",
    "such extension was also motivated by recent ixs studies on simple liquid metals near the melting temperature  @xcite . from a detailed line - shape analysis of @xmath0 ,",
    "the viscoelastic model was found to be unable to account for inelastic peaks in these systems .",
    "it was found , instead , that a two - time - scale model for the memory kernel successfully describes the observed spectral shapes .",
    "thus , a convincing experimental demonstration is provided for the simultaneous presence two relaxation processes with slow and fast characteristic time scales , termed structural ( labeled @xmath5 ) and microscopic ( labeled @xmath6 ) processes .",
    "furthermore , it was pointed out that the faster @xmath6 process is the major controller of the positive dispersion observed in these systems since it was always found that @xmath7 for the slower time scale @xmath8 , whereas @xmath9 becomes close to unity at some wave number for the faster time scale @xmath10 . according to this experimental observation",
    ", the positive dispersion can not fully be ascribed to the structural relaxation .",
    "the nature of these two processes have been studied in more detail in ref .",
    "@xcite based on the md simulation for a model of lithium . from the analysis of the simulated @xmath0 with the two - time - scale model , a strong temperature dependence was observed for the time scale @xmath8 , corroborating that the slower process is associated with the structural relaxation . on the other hand ,",
    "the faster @xmath6 process was found to persist both in liquid and glass phases with almost no temperature dependence of its relaxation time @xmath10 .",
    "the persistence of the @xmath6 relaxation accounts for the presence of the positive dispersion in glasses .",
    "of course , a natural question would be what is relaxing at that low @xmath11 , i.e. , what is the microscopic nature of the @xmath6 dynamics .",
    "this was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite based on the computer simulation for a harmonic glass .",
    "there , it was suggested that the origin of this process can be ascribed to the topological disorder , i.e. , the decay of the memory kernel is due to the dephasing of different oscillatory components in the force fluctuations .",
    "besides the peak associated with the high - frequency sound , the md  @xcite and ixs  @xcite works showed the presence of additional low - frequency excitation in the dynamic structure factors @xmath0 or in the related longitudinal current spectra @xmath12 .",
    "this second low - frequency excitation  also called the boson peak  exhibits some general characteristics : it appears in the spectra at @xmath2 values larger than some fraction of the structure - factor - peak position , and its resonance position is weakly @xmath2-dependent .",
    "it was conjectured that the low - frequency excitation reflects the transversal dynamics , and the appearance of the transversal mode in the longitudinal current spectra was interpreted as being due to `` mixing '' phenomena caused by microscopic disorder  @xcite .",
    "the main evidence supporting this conjecture lies in the simulation results that the low - frequency excitation appears at the same resonance frequency in both of the transversal and longitudinal current spectra , but its intensity is more enhanced in the former .",
    "another support was inferred from studies on the density dependence . the computational work in ref .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the resonance frequency of the low - frequency excitation in the transversal current spectra increases with increasing density .",
    "experimentally , it is observed that upon densification the boson - peak energy shifts to higher energy and its intensity strongly decreases  @xcite .",
    "this parallel of the density dependence was claimed to also suggest that the boson - peak - like low - frequency excitation arises from the transversal dynamics .    in this paper , we present a microscopic and unified explanation of the mentioned features of the high - frequency dynamics in liquids and glasses  the anomalous dispersion of the high - frequency sound velocity and the nature of the low - frequency excitation  which have so far been investigated somewhat independently .",
    "this will be done based on the mode - coupling theory ( mct ) for ideal liquid - glass transition  @xcite .",
    "originally , the mct was developed to deal with structural - relaxation processes which evolve as precursor of the glass transition .",
    "on the other hand , the glass transition also modifies the short - time or the high - frequency dynamics .",
    "the study of these modifications was the main subject in ref .",
    "it was shown there that the strong interaction between density fluctuations at microscopic length scales and the arrested glass structure causes an anomalous - oscillation peak ( aop ) , which exhibits the properties of the boson peak . as will be demonstrated in the present study , the aop persists in liquid states as well as in glass states .",
    "it will be discussed how the sound mode interferes with other low - lying modes present in the system .",
    "thereby , we provide a systematic explanation of the anomalous sound - velocity dispersion in systems  ranging from high temperature liquid down to deep inside the glass state  in terms of the contributions from the structural - relaxation processes and from the vibrational modes building the aop . a possibility of observing negative dispersion ",
    "the _ decrease _ of the sound velocity upon increase of the wave number  is argued when the sound - velocity dispersion is dominated by the contribution from the vibrational dynamics .",
    "we also show that the low - frequency excitation , observable in both of the glass - state longitudinal and transversal current spectra at the same resonance frequency , is the manifestation of the aop .",
    "this seems to be an alternative interpretation to the mixing phenomena mentioned above . as a natural consequence of the presence of the aop in the transversal current spectra",
    ", it is predicted that the transversal sound velocity also exhibits the anomalous dispersion .",

    "but , it does not show up as a peak in @xmath332 due to the two - mode contributions , which are neglected within the sga .",
    "thus , the increase of the intensity of @xmath332 , in particular , the smearing out of the `` gap '' for @xmath508 , with increasing @xmath502 is due to the development of the two - mode contributions . because of",
