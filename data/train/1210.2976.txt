    "the interactions among nucleons are governed by quantum cromodynamics ( qcd ) . in the low energy regime relevant to nuclear physics , qcd is not perturbative and thus difficult to solve .",
    "a series of models have been devised in the literature to describe nuclear forces in terms of effective degrees of freedom , protons and neutrons .",
    "different approaches have been investigated , from pure phenomenology to theories based on meson exchanges and more recently to the systematic approach of effective field theory @xcite . for the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath2 )",
    "sector , several potentials are available that fit @xmath2 scattering data with high accuracy . on the other hand , since the nuclear potential has an effective nature , it is in principle a many - body operator .",
    "so one expects three - body forces ( @xmath3 ) to be important .",
    "hence , a debate is taking place regarding the role of @xmath3s and how they can be constrained .",
    "for the determination of realistic three - body potentials or to discriminate among different models , one needs to find some few - nucleon observables involving at least three nucleons that show sensitivity to the different nuclear hamiltonians .",
    "one also needs to perform these studies in the framework of few - body systems , where one can use exact calculations to test the nuclear interactions from a comparison to experiment .",
    "an important activity in this direction has taken place in recent years , with calculations of bound - state and hadronic scattering properties of light nuclei .",
    "electromagnetic observables are complementary quantities that need to be investigated as well to shed more light on the not yet fully understood three - nucleon forces . in this paper",
    "we will present an update on recent studies of electromagnetic observables and we will limit the discussion to the well bound @xmath0he nucleus and to @xmath1he as an example in halo nuclei .    the paper is structured in the following way . in sec .",
