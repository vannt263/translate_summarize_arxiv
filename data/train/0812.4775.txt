    "the diffraction of a plane wave by a slit has often been discussed as an illustration of heisenberg s uncertainty relations and their role in the process of measurement .",
    "such a discussion typically involves two distinct steps : @xmath4 the evaluation of the uncertainties represented schematically in the experiment in question ; @xmath5 the analysis of the connection between the uncertainties and the process of measurement .",
    "let us begin with the ordinary case of a single particle passing through a slit in a diaphragm of some experimental arrangement .",
    "even if the momentum of the particle is completely known before it impinges on the diaphragm , the diffraction by the slit of the plane wave will imply an uncertainty in the momentum of the particle , after it has passed the diaphragm , which is greater the narrower the slit .",
    "now the width of the slit , say @xmath2 , may be taken as the uncertainty of the position of the particle relative to the diaphragm , in a direction perpendicular to the slit .",
    "it is seen from de broglie s relation between momentum and wave - length that the uncertainty @xmath1 of the momentum of the particle in this direction is correlated to @xmath2 by means of heisenberg s general principle @xmath6 . in his celebrated paper @xcite published in 1927 ,",
    "heisenberg attempted to establish this quantitative expression as the minimum amount of unavoidable momentum disturbance caused by any position measurement .",
    "in @xcite he did not give a unique definition for the uncertainties @xmath2 and @xmath1 , but estimated them by some plausible measure in each case separately . in his lecture @xcite he emphasized his principle by the formal refinement @xmath7 on the other hand , it was kennard @xcite in 1927 who first proved the well - known inequality @xmath8 with @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , @xmath11 being the ordinary standard deviations of position and momentum .",
    "heisenberg himself proved relation ( [ k ] ) for gaussian states @xcite .    in view of what follows ,",
    "we first want to mention the different meanings of the term uncertainty in ( [ ungl ] ) and ( [ k ] ) in more detail and specify their corresponding measurement processes .",
    "let us begin with the measurement process of kennard s approach ( [ k ] ) .",
    "for a given particle in a state @xmath12 , the standard deviations in ( [ k ] ) are formally defined by @xmath13 and refer to two separate experiments , in the sense that to each sample of particles either a position or a momentum measurement is applied , and the initial state @xmath12 of the particle is the _ same _ in both cases .",
    "there are never two measurements performed at one and the same particle .",
    "+ instead , heisenberg discusses a different measurement process . according to ( [ ungl ] ) , position and momentum",
    "are both considered for the same particle and the key observation is that the initial measurement of the position necessarily disturbs the particle , so that the momentum is changed by the preparation . actually , this is the situation when particles pass a slit .",
    "+ in what will follow , we just focus on expression ( [ ungl ] ) . a theoretical analysis of the measurement process regarding ( [ k ] )",
    "has recently been discussed in @xcite .",
    "in the single - slit diffraction experiment , a monochromatic plane wave , representing an incoming beam of particles with momentum @xmath14 , incident on a wall that contains an infinitely long slit of width @xmath15 and the diffracted particles are observed on a screen placed at a distance @xmath16 behind the slit . without loss of generality , the wave functions in position spaces can be considered to be @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the position coordinate in the direction perpendicular to the slit , and @xmath19 is the momentum component along the same direction . the most natural measure of the uncertainty in position is the width of the slit , i.e. @xmath20 , while any particle reaching the screen has to pass the slit in advance .",
    "then , all particles of the sample acquire a momentum spread on passing through the slit in accordance to the distribution @xmath21 ) , the uncertainty in the momentum is evaluated as the width of the main peak in the fraunhofer diffraction pattern .",
    "typically , the latter is chosen twice the value of the first interference minimum ( fim ) , or equal to the full width at the half maximum ( fwhm ) @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "more generally , the probability of detecting particles of momentum @xmath19 within the interval @xmath1 is simply computed by integrating out the density ( [ psip ] ) .",
    "we obtain the following expression @xcite : @xmath22\\\\ \\xi & = & \\frac{\\delta p\\delta x}{h}\\label{xi},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is planck s quantum of action and the sine - integral is si@xmath24 .",
    "the probability ( [ prob1 ] ) is explicitly dependent on the product of the precisions @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( or @xmath25 ) , ensuring the trade - off between the complementary observables .    .",
    "the plane - wave ( exact ) is strictly below the least upper bound .",
    "more than @xmath3 of measurement events forbidden by the heisenberg relation eq .",
    "( 1 ) still do exist in the region of @xmath26 ( blue area).,width=313,height=264 ]    in fig.[fig1 ] , we see the measurement probability with respect to the parameter @xmath25 .",
    "the fim and the fwhm correspond to the case @xmath27 and @xmath28 respectively .",
    "the heisenberg relation ( [ ungl ] ) is expressed by the step - function at @xmath29 which corresponds to the statement that the probability of every measurement event for @xmath26 is identical to zero .",
    "accordingly , there should be no measurement event in this region .",
    "the least upper bound of the momentum probability has recently been derived by one of the authors , see @xcite . for @xmath26 , we see that the plane wave is very tight below the upper bound in fig.[fig1 ] .    in the experimental setup we have to consider that expression ( [ psip ] )",
    "is related to the diffraction pattern that is seen on a distant screen by substitution @xmath30 , where @xmath18 is the coordinate perpendicular to the beam measured on the screen , while @xmath31 is the initial momentum of the particles .",
    "the incident wave may represent either the schrdinger wave function of a particle of mass @xmath32 , in which case the angular frequency is @xmath33 , or else it may represent the electric field amplitude of an electromagnetic wave ( linearly polarized parallel to the edges ) , in which case @xmath34 .",
    "the latter approach is represented by the helmholtz equation and the rigorous mathematical formulation is the same in both cases . by simple algebraic substitution",
    "we obtain the following intensity pattern at the screen in terms of @xmath18 in the fraunhofer approach latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } \\label{psix }    and the screen position @xmath18 is related to the parameter of ( [ prob1 ] ) by @xmath36 the latter is the key quantity relating the theoretical predictions of fig.[fig1 ] within the slit to the intensity pattern at the screen .",
    "each single device of the experimental setup is fixed on an optical bench fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "we use laser light of the spontaneous and stimulated emission between the @xmath37 and @xmath38 states which results in a wavelength of @xmath39 , the typical operating wavelength of a hene - laser ( power : @xmath40 ) .",
    "the monochromatic laser beam of 480 @xmath41 m diameter is projected on the slit , while the intensity of the beam is adjusted by a polarization filter .",
    "the width of the slit is @xmath42 m .",
    "it is initially measured with a microscope , verified by evaluation of the diffraction pattern and again measured after the experimental run has passed .",
    "the intensities of the diffraction patterns are measured by a charge - coupled - device sensor ( ccd - sensor , toshiba tcd1201d ) .",
    "it is located at the distance of @xmath43 mm behind the slit .",
    "the ccd consists of 2048 pixels ( picture element ) , which are arranged in a line in @xmath18-direction transverse to the beam .",
    "it is a light - sensitive integrated circuit that stores and displays the data for an image in such a way that each pixel converts the image - information into an electrical voltage @xmath44 .",
    "the intensity of the partial image per pixel is measured in an electrical potential which is related to the number of photons reaching the pixel .",
    "the measurement range and the resolution of the ccd - sensor is given by the number of pixels ( @xmath45 ) and the size of a single pixel @xmath46 m .",
    "each measurement takes place in a darkroom to prevent adventitious light . in agreement to the dark signal voltage of the data sheet @xcite",
    ", the average electrical voltage defines the baseline and is within the range of @xmath47 mv . to avoid measurement errors proceeding from systematical inhomogeneities of the ccd",
    ", we carefully considered a homogeneous illumination .",
    "there we found that the photo response non - uniformity of the sensor also is within the small range of @xmath48 mv .",
    "compared to the effective range of @xmath49v output voltage this results in a very small relative systematic error . +",
    "a single measurement consists of a snapshot of 2048 pixels of the diffraction pattern which is symmetrically centered around the pixel @xmath50 .",
    "thus , every snapshot consists of a data array @xmath51 , while the corresponding transverse deflection from the optical bench is @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "the exposure time for one snapshot is adjusted to 1.25 ms and the sample size is chosen by @xmath54 arrays .",
    "therefore , we obtain high statistics within a short measurement time .",
    "in fig.[fig3 ] , we see the average diffraction pattern of the measurement compared to the analytic density ( [ psix ] ) . the corresponding error bars are very small and ca nt be resolved in this figure , therefore we omit any markers .",
    "the experimental data fit very well to the theoretical computation up to 10 orders of diffraction .",
    "this is necessary for the high precision numerical integration of the density to obtain ( [ prob1 ] ) , which is based on the measured data .        it should be stressed here , that we do not normalize the main peak of the measured histogram by the maximum voltage measured in the central peak , as mostly done ( incorrectly ) in literature .",
    "instead , we have to consider as many orders of diffraction as possible and compute the total voltage over all pixels to obtain a proper probability normalization of the empirical histogram .",
    "the partial area of the momentum interval @xmath1 of the empirical density is obtained by standard numerical integration routines .",
    "+ in fig.[fig1 ] , we see the monotonic increasing behavior of the corresponding probability distribution .",
    "the error bars can not be resolved in the figure and thus are not explicitly expressed .",
    "the results fit well with the theoretical expression ( [ prob1 ] ) . in the range",
    "@xmath55 there is a slight overestimation of the theoretical prediction .",
    "this is due to residual light reflected by the laboratory instruments ( infrared sources too ) and caused by electronic noise .    in the whole measurement domain",
    "@xmath56 the experimental results are properly below the least upper bound . especially in the critical deep quantum domain , @xmath57 ,",
    "the data is slightly below the least upper bound . according to the original heisenberg relation ( [ ungl ] ) ,",
    "events with @xmath26 are not measurable . however , in fig.[fig1 ] we see that more than 44% of those events excluded by heisenberg are still measurable by this high precision experiment .",
