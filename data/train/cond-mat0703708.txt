    "sio@xmath2 film , which is currently used as a gate insulator , is expected to be replaced with high dielectric constant ( high-@xmath3 ) materials such as hfsion ( ref . ) and laalo ( ref . ) to further reduce the electrical thickness without the reduction in physical thickness .",
    "since one of the reasons for the use of si substrates is that sio@xmath2 film of good quality can be grown by thermal oxidation on si surfaces , other materials could be used as substrates instead of si if high-@xmath3 materials were used instead of sio@xmath2 .",
    "germanium , which was the first semiconductor used at the dawn of semiconductor technology , is again being promoted as an alternative substrate to si .",
    "one of the reasons for the replacement of ge with si was the difficulty in growing stable germanium oxide .",
    "this issue , however , becomes irrelevant when high-@xmath3 materials are employed instead of sio@xmath2 .",
    "a characteristic that makes ge attractive is the higher mobility in ge than in si .",
    "the mobilities of electrons and holes in ge are 1900 and 3900  @xmath4/vs , respectively , whereas the corresponding mobilities in si are 450 and 1500  @xmath4/vs , respectively .",
    "@xcite therefore , higher surface mobilities of electrons and holes are also expected in metal - insulator - semiconductor field effect transistors ( misfets ) with ge substrates than in those with si substrates .",

    "@xcite to the best of our knowledge , there have been no reports on high mobility in @xmath0-channel misfets with ge substrates .",
    "this is mainly due to the high contact resistance at metal/@xmath5ge junction , which prevents precise measurement of mobility .",
    "the high contact resistance is a result of the difficulty in obtaining @xmath6ge layers with sufficiently high electrical concentrations ( carrier concentrations ) , especially in the case of fabrication by ion implantation .",

    "the profiles of the chemical and electrical concentrations of @xmath0-type impurities in ge under various conditions were investigated to clarify the diffusion mechanism and the electrical activation of @xmath0-type dopants in ge .",
    "in addition , the effects of ion implantation damage on the activation were studied in detail .",
    "the profiles revealed that the electrical concentrations tend to become saturated in the case of heavy doses of impurity , whereas the chemical concentrations increase with implanted doses of impurity .",
    "the relationship between the chemical and electrical concentrations of p in ge was calculated , and it was found that the activation ratio of p in ge is comparable to that in si because of the shallower impurity level of p and the lower conduction band density of state ( dos ) in ge .",
    "the activation levels of as in ge were lower than those of p in ge .",
    "the profiles of the chemical and electrical concentrations of p in ge showed a concentration - dependent diffusion , which could be explained by the dopant - vacancy - pair ( av)@xmath7 mechanism .",
    "the highest activation ratio data value did not exceed the incomplete ionization ratio value obtained by calculation , taking into account the single donor level , implying insufficient formation of the impurity band .",

    "@xmath29 is a diffusion coefficient associated with the intrinsic carrier concentration , while @xmath30 is an effective diffusion coefficient that has quadratic dependence on the carrier concentration .",
    "this dependence is due to the difference in the charge states between p@xmath31 and ( pv)@xmath7 , which has its origins in the indirect diffusion of p@xmath31 through the formation of ( pv)@xmath7 .",
    "@xcite    the shapes of the profiles in the results can be explained by referring to this model . in the region of low impurity concentration ,",

    ", impurities spread deep into ge substrates [ fig . [",
    "fig2](a ) ] .",
    "at the time , electrically activated impurities diffuse into the ge substrates , keeping the activation levels almost constant [ fig . [ fig2](b ) ] .",
    "interestingly , the total number of activated dopants increases with temperature , even though the dose is not changed .",
    "it thus appears that electrically activated impurities are generated as the temperature is increased . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , a large number of inactive impurities , beyond the saturation levels for activated impurities , exist around the surface .",

    "the solid line indicates the result for fully activated p in ge , while the dotted line indicates the result taking into account incomplete ionization,@xcite the details of which will be shown later .",
    "the data for higher doses tends to distribute in the region of higher chemical concentration . as the temperature becomes higher",
    ", the chemical concentrations tend to be lower , owing to the faster diffusion of dopants . on the other hand",

    "a temperature of 500@xmath16 or more is required to activate impurities ; however , even at such high temperatures , the activation ratio does not reach 100% .",
    "let us consider why dopants have a much lower electrical activation in ge than in si .",
    "one of the possibilities is the low dos ; the effective dos in the conduction band of ge ( 1.04@xmath33  @xmath10 ) is lower than that in the conduction band of si ( 2.8@xmath33  @xmath10).@xcite it is thought that the lower dos enhances incomplete ionization @xcite in ge , in contrast to the case of si , because electrons need excitation to move from the donor level to higher energy levels of the conduction band .",
    "the relationships between the chemical and electrical concentrations of p in ge and in si were calculated to estimate how a low dos affects the ionization ratio ( the activation ratio ) . in the calculation , the fermi level that satisfied the charge neutrality was searched .",
    "@xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 here , @xmath0 is the electron concentration in the conduction band , @xmath37 is the conduction band dos , @xmath38 is the impurity concentration , and @xmath39 is the electron concentration in the donor level , which is assumed to be a single level . as shown by the dotted curves in figs .",
    "[ fig3](a)-[fig3](c ) , the activation ratio decreases with the chemical concentration .",
    "coincidentally , this curve is almost the same as that for si [ fig .",
    "[ fig3](d ) ] , which is similar to the curve for si obtained by xiao _",
    "@xcite this is because the donor level of p in ge ( @xmath40=12  mev ) is shallower than that in si ( 45  mev ) .",
    "@xcite the ionization ratio tends to increase as the impurity level becomes shallower and as the dos increases .",
    "the effect of the shallower donor level and that of the lower dos compensate each other in this case .",
    "thus , the ionization ratio of p in ge can be regarded as almost the same as that in si . in the case of si",
    ", previous reports have indicated that the ionization ratio decreases with the doping concentration at low concentrations ( @xmath41  @xmath10 ) owing to the incomplete ionization , and then starts to increase at high concentrations ( @xmath42  @xmath10 ) owing to the formation of impurity bands @xcite in the band gap of si .",
    "it is believed that mott ( metal - insulator ) transition @xcite and the merging of the conduction band and impurity band @xcite are a possible mechanism for the metallic ( degenerate semiconductor ) properties in heavily doped si .",
    "( color online ) relationship between the chemical concentration and the electrical concentration of p in ge substrates .",
    "the concentrations were measured at the same depth using sims and srp .",
    "the samples were annealed at ( a ) 400 , ( b ) 500 , and ( c ) 600@xmath16 .",
    "the solid lines correspond to an activation ratio of 100% .",
    "the dotted lines indicate the calculated electrical concentrations of p in ge as functions of the chemical concentrations at 300  k , taking the effects of incomplete ionization into consideration .",
    "the calculated results obtained for p in si by the authors and by xiao _ et al_. ( ref . ) , whose results are similar , are shown in ( d).,width=321 ]    the experimental data values , especially those at 500 and 600@xmath16 , show a tendency to distribute along on the dotted curve ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "it should be emphasized here that the dotted curve indicates the upper limit of the electrical concentration at a chemical concentration , calculated on the basis of the incomplete ionization effect in a single donor level . to exceed this curve , dopants need to form an impurity band as well as to entirely substitute in ge . by analogy to the case of si and in light of the shallower donor level and lower critical concentration of the mott transition ( 2.57@xmath43  @xmath10 for ge , 3.5@xmath44  @xmath10 for si),@xcite the impurity band in ge should be formed to reach the activation ratio of 100% in the region of high concentration ( @xmath45  @xmath10 ) .",
    "it is therefore speculated that the poor activation of impurities in ge is a result of insufficient formation of the impurity band in the energy band gap , which may be caused by various complexes , such as dopant - vacancy pairs and/or clustering of impurities .",
    "a previous report has suggested the possible presence of p clusters in ge at high concentrations of p.@xcite when clusters are formed , they can be of two possible types .",
    "the first type is an electrically inactive cluster . in this case , of course , the cluster does not contribute to the formation of the impurity band and the number of impurities interacting with each other decreases or the distance between the impurities increases , causing poor activation .",
    "the second type is an electrically active cluster . even in this case , the activation ratio would decline .",
    "since impurities in clusters are locally aggregated , they would not interact significantly with nearby impurities or other clusters , leading to insufficient impurity band formation .",
    "our experiments showed that the electrical concentration for the same chemical concentration tended to increase with the annealing temperature .",
    "it is therefore thought that clusters and/or some complexes are decomposed into impurities at higher temperature to form an impurity band , leading to higher activation ratios .",
    "next , the effects of impurity differences and ion implantation damage on the profiles are examined .",
    "figures [ fig4](a ) and [ fig4](b ) show the profiles of the chemical and electrical concentrations , respectively , of the impurities ( p and as ) in ge .",
    "`` p i / i '' and `` as i / i , '' respectively , indicate the profiles of p and as implanted in ge substrates .",
    "`` ge i / i , p i / i '' refers to the profiles of p in ge substrate where ge was implanted first , followed by p. the annealing temperature was 500@xmath16 .",
    "the implanted dose was 1@xmath14  @xmath15 .",
    "it was found that the profiles of p in ge with and without implanted ge were almost the same , for both the chemical concentration and the electrical concentration . on the other hand",
    ", the profiles of p were different from those of as .",
    "the chemical concentrations of p and as were @xmath112@xmath810@xmath17 and @xmath112@xmath810@xmath46  @xmath10 , respectively , whereas their electrical concentrations were @xmath111@xmath810@xmath17 and @xmath112@xmath810@xmath47  @xmath10 , respectively . the differences between the profiles of p and as [ figs . [ fig4](a ) and [ fig4](b ) ] and why the activation level of as is lower than that of p in ge are now examined .",
    "some studies have discussed these issues .",
    "@xcite according to them , one of the possible explanations for the differences is the solid solubility .",
    "_ @xcite have reported that the electrical concentrations of @xmath0-type impurities such as p and as implanted in ge are saturated .",
    "a similar tendency was observed in our results . in their work , the saturation levels of p and as reached @xmath115@xmath810@xmath17 and @xmath113.5@xmath810@xmath17  @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "they concluded that this difference was caused by solid solubility differences .",
    "our understanding is that the solid solubility is generally related to the atomic radius , and larger atoms are substituted less in the ge crystal .",
    "therefore , as , due to its larger size , has a lower solid solubility than p. we think that the excess as impurities , which can not be substituted in the ge lattice as a result of their low solid solubility , form various complexes and/or clusters , leading to the poor activation of as . on the other hand , we also think that the formation of acceptorlike defects generated by ion implantation may contribute to the poor activation of as .",
    "defects generated in ge tend to form acceptorlike defects.@xcite such defects may compensate the donor levels of the @xmath0-type impurities , and therefore reduce the concentrations of electrons . since the amount of damage generated in ge tends to increase with the mass of the implanted atoms,@xcite it is possible that the implantation of as causes more such defects in the ge substrate than the implantation of p ; however , this has not yet been clarified .",
    "this possibility can be clarified from the ge i / i , p i / i profiles in figs . [ fig4](a ) and [ fig4](b ) .",
    "since ge has almost the same mass as as , the damage by implantation of ge should be almost the same as that of as . if the damage by implantation causes poor activation of as relative to p , the electrical concentrations in the ge substrates where both p and ge were implanted should be less than that in the ge substrates where only p was implanted . as shown in figs . [ fig4](a ) and [ fig4](b ) , however , there were no differences in the chemical or electrical concentrations of p in the two cases , and the concentration of p in the substrate was higher than that of as .",

    "the relationships between the chemical and electrical concentrations of p in ge and in si were calculated .",
    "the results indicated that the ionization ratio of p in ge was comparable to that of p in si owing to the effects of the shallower donor level in ge relative to si and the lower conduction band dos in ge relative to si compensating each other .",
    "in addition , the low electrical activation of p in ge was shown to be the result of insufficient formation of the impurity band required to reach the ionization ratio of 100% .",
