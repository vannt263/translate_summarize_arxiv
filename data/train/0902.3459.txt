    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the cause for the lack of hot jupiters and other close - in giant planets around high - mass stars is less clear .",
    "one possibility is that hot jupiters surrounding high - mass stars are engulfed as the stars evolved off the main sequence @xcite .",
    "however , most high - mass stars with planets ( subgiants ) are physically too small to engulf hot jupiters @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "i show that models of planet formation / migration with a stellar - mass - dependent lifetime of the gaseous circumstellar disks from which planets form can explain the dearth of hot jupiters around high - mass stars as suggested by radial velocity surveys .",
    "if gas disks disappear much faster around high - mass stars than around solar and subsolar - mass stars , then inward migration is halted and the planets are stranded at large semimajor axes .",
    "the arguments described here build on work by @xcite who studied how a stellar - mass - dependent gas disk lifetime may explain why the period valley is more pronounced for planets orbiting f stars than g and k stars . in section 2 ,",
    "i make simple analytical arguments to show that the observed semimajor axis distribution of giant planets may emerge from a stellar - mass - dependent disk lifetime . in section 3 ,",
    "i perform numerical modeling similar to recent work ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "i construct synthetic distributions of giant planets using a suite of monte carlo simulations with a range of stellar mass - dependent disk lifetimes and as well as a mass - independent lifetime .",
    "a mass - independent lifetime poorly reproduces the observed semimajor axis distribution of planets , while a mass - dependent lifetime reproduces observed trends .",
    "planets form in disks around young stars .",
    "once planets grow to jovian masses , they can open a gap in the disk and undergo type ii migration @xcite with a migration rate regulated by the local viscous diffusion time . for regions interior to @xmath3 20 au",
    ", migration is inward .",
    "the migration rate can be parameterized assuming a minimum mass solar nebula ( mmsn ) model as prescribed in @xcite scaled to the star s mass where the initial gas column density is @xmath7 = 2400 g @xmath8 at 1 au : @xmath9 in this equation , m@xmath0/m@xmath10 is the planet mass in jovian masses , @xmath11 is the viscosity parameter , m@xmath12 is the stellar mass , t is time , and @xmath13 is the timescale for the local disk surface density to drop to @xmath2 12% of its original value in @xcite equal to m@xmath12/m@xmath5",
    ". equation 65 in @xcite is missing a factor of @xmath14 . ] .",
    "the maximum type ii migration rate is the radial velocity of the gas , da@xmath0/dt @xmath15 -1.5@xmath16 , where h is the disk scale height at a@xmath0 and @xmath17 is the keplerian frequency . for a mmsn surface density profile",
    "this rate is @xmath18 this equation governs the migration rate for disk masses that are much larger than the planet s mass . the nominal migration timescale from equation 1 , a@xmath0/(da@xmath0/dt ) , is then @xmath19 @xmath3 0.16 myr for a jovian mass planet at 1 au with @xmath11 = 5@xmath2010@xmath21 if @xmath22@xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath13 .",
    "the timescale from the maximum drift rate ( equation 2 ) is about half this value .",
    "if the local surface density in a gaseous disk is drained to @xmath2 1% of its initial value ( t @xmath3 @xmath13 ) , equation 1 implies a migration rate of @xmath2 1 au/20myr .",
    "because nearly all gaseous circumstellar disks disappear by @xmath3 10 myr @xcite , migration is essentially halted .",
    "thus , migration is halted if @xmath13 @xmath2 @xmath19 .",
    "simple arguments show that the gas disk lifetime may depend on stellar mass ( @xmath13 @xmath25 m@xmath12@xmath26 ) and that the ratio of @xmath13 to @xmath19 may _ strongly _",
    "depend on stellar mass ( see also * ? ? ?",

    ", a planet orbiting a 3 m@xmath5 star migrates inward at a slower rate than one orbiting a 1 m@xmath5 star if @xmath31 @xmath3 1 . at slightly later times ( e.g. , t/@xmath32 = 0.3 ) , the migration rate for a planet orbiting 3 m@xmath5 star is half that for one orbiting a 1 m@xmath5 star .",
    "therefore , migration around higher - mass stars decelerates earlier ; @xmath13/@xmath19 will be smaller for higher - mass stars . because smaller timescale ratios will strand more gas giants at larger semimajor axes ( e.g. @xmath15 1 au ) , the relative frequency of hot jupiters and other close - in planets should be lower for higher - mass stars .",
    "to test whether a stellar - mass - dependent gas disk lifetime can explain the observed distribution of extrasolar gas giant planets , i produce synthetic populations of exoplanets in semimajor axis vs. stellar mass space using a suite of monte carlo simulations .",

    "future modifications include incorporating a more sophisticated treatment of circumstellar gas accretion , modeling type i migration , determining the sensitivity of the planets synthetic distributions to the migration rate ( i.e. , value of @xmath11 ) , and tracking the migration of planets _ while _ they are accreting gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "<S> based on a suite of monte carlo simulations , i show that a stellar - mass - dependent lifetime of the gas disks from which planets form can explain the lack of hot jupiters / close - in giant planets around high - mass stars and other key features of the observed semimajor axis distribution of radial velocity - detected giant planets . using reasonable parameters for the type ii migration rate , regions of planet formation , and timescales for gas giant core formation , </S>",
    "<S> i construct synthetic distributions of jovian planets . </S>",
    "<S> a planet formation / migration model assuming a stellar mass - dependent gas disk lifetime reproduces key features in the observed distribution by preferentially stranding planets around high - mass stars at large semimajor axes . </S>"
