    "the analysis of nucleon resonance production and subsequent decay is possibly the best tool to study the most striking aspects of non - perturbative qcd . following this fact",
    "a large multinational effort has been devoted during the last two decades to gather detailed information about resonance excitation both using hadronic and electromagnetic probes .    in recent years",
    "most of the emphasis has fallen on the electroexcitation of resonances seen in meson electroproduction experiments ,  @xcite , and a large amount of accurate data has been collected at jefferson laboratory ( jlab ) , mainz , bonn , graal , and spring-8 .",
    "the involved nature of the problem , which comprises excitation of resonances and multistep meson - baryon processes is nowadays believed to demand a dynamical coupled - channels approach . in this work",
    "we will consider the one developed recently , msl , and which is explained in great detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the starting point of the msl model is a set of lagrangians describing the interactions between mesons ( including the photon ) ( @xmath0 = @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) and baryons ( @xmath5 ) . by applying a unitary transformation method  @xcite , an effective hamiltonian , with an energy independent set of potentials ,",
    "is then derived from the considered lagrangian .",
    "the resulting meson - baryon ( @xmath6 ) scattering amplitudes are , @xmath7 where @xmath8 . the full amplitudes , e.g. @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 can be directly used to , within the same framework , compute @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , @xmath15 , scattering observables .",
    "the non - resonant amplitude @xmath16 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tmbmb ] ) is defined by the coupled - channels equations , @xmath17 with @xmath18 where @xmath19 are the non - resonant @xmath6 potentials and @xmath20 is due to the one - particle - exchange between unstable @xmath21 states which are the resonant components of the @xmath22 channel .    the second term in the right - hand - side of eq .",

    "\\label{eq : nstar - g}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the bare mass of the resonant state @xmath26 .",
    "the dressed vertex interactions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tmbmb - r ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : nstar - g ] ) are ( defining @xmath27 ) @xmath28",
    "to illustrate the procedure that is being followed in our current work we will first consider a simplified version of the model sketched above .",
    "we consider only two channels , @xmath30 and @xmath12 , and will concentrate on the @xmath29 ( 1232 ) region .",
    "the full framework is described in great detail in ref .",
    "it is a revision of the sato - lee model  @xcite with one important improvement : we extract the @xmath31-@xmath29 form factors by fitting all of the available pion electroproduction data at energies close to the @xmath29 position .    the vertex @xmath32 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mb - nstar ] ) can be written in terms of three form factors @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 which are referred to as _ dressed _",
    "form factors .",
    "similarly the vertex , @xmath36 , accepts a similar decomposition in terms of @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , which are called _ bare _ form factors .    to extract the @xmath31-@xmath29 dressed ( and bare ) form factors , we abandon the simple parameterization used in ref .  @xcite and perform @xmath40 fits to available experimental electroproduction data at each @xmath41 by adjusting the values of the bare form factors .",
    "the resulting bare form factors are shown as symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig : bff ] .",
    "like any reaction involving @xmath42 systems , such as the atomic and nuclear reactions , the full amplitude describing the process has a non - resonant part and a resonant part , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : tmbmb ] ) .    qualitatively speaking , the non - resonant amplitude , @xmath43 , is due to the _ fast _ process through some direct particle exchange mechanisms , and the resonant amplitude @xmath44 is due to the _ time - delayed _ process where the incoming particles lose their identities and form an unstable system which then decays into various final states .",
    "the unitarity condition @xmath45 implies that @xmath43 and @xmath44 are not independent from each other .",
    "the close relation between the resonant and non - resonant amplitude is not specific to the formulation considered here , but is the consequence of a very general unitarity condition .",
    "thus the extracted dressed form factors @xmath34 , @xmath33 , @xmath35 of the resonant amplitude can only be compared with the hadron structure calculations of current matrix element @xmath46 which contain meson loops . the bare form factors may in principle be compared to those obtained from phenomenological calculations which do not include meson clouds , e.g. quark models or specific lattice qcd simulations .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : bff ] we compare our extracted bare form factors to two relativistic quark model studies , refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the comparison shows that both agree reasonably well for the magnetic and electric form factors but fail to capture the behavior of @xmath47 .",
    "the next necessary step is to connect the current description to the extant lattice qcd simulations of the @xmath48 transition .",
    "after the discussion in the previous section we go back to the full coupled - channels model which will be used to analyze the experimental electroproduction data at center of mass energies below 2 gev .",
    "first we consider the meson - baryon interactions involving @xmath49 and use the extensive database for @xmath50 ( and also the @xmath13 ) to fix the non - resonant parameters entering in the phenomenological lagrangians .",
    "the parameter values used in this model are given in ref .",
    "once the meson - baryon sector is fixed we will , in a first stage , leave it unchanged and produce a first description of the single meson photoproduction data .    with the non - resonant amplitudes generated from solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : nr - tmbmb ] ) , the resonant amplitude @xmath51 eq .",
    "( [ eq : tmbmb - r ] ) then depends on the bare mass @xmath52 and the bare @xmath53 vertex functions , which are parametrized in ref .  @xcite .    in figure  [ faa ]",
    "we depict the real part of @xmath54 compared to the energy independent extraction of the gwu group  @xcite , the agreement is quite good in almost all @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 waves .",
    "more importantly , the model describes successfully the differential cross section and target polarization asymmetries as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the fit to @xmath12 elastic scattering can not fully constrain the bare @xmath59 parameters .",
    "thus the results for these unstable particle channels must be refined by fitting the @xmath60 data , this is currently being pursued  @xcite .",
    "with the hadronic parameters determined in the previous section we proceed to analyze the extensive database of @xmath61 photoproduction . here",
    "the only parameters that need to be determined are the bare @xmath62 vertex interactions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mb - nstar ] ) similarly to what we did in the simplified model of section 2 .",
    "the strategy is to start with the bare helicity amplitudes of resonances at the values given by the pdg  @xcite .",
    "then , we allow small variations with respect to those values and also in a preliminary step also allow small variations of a selected set of non - resonant parameters . at this stage we can only present preliminary results which are at the present time being further improved and will be reported elsewhere .",
    "first , our main emphasis is set on understanding the region up to @xmath63 gev but keeping a resonable description up to 2 gev extending in that way previous works where only the @xmath29 ( 1232 ) region was studied  @xcite . in figure",
    "[ dcs_efb ] we depict angular distributions for both @xmath64 and @xmath65 photoproduction differential cross sections in the @xmath66 region and also give an example of the prediction of the model for higher center of mass energies at a fixed angle .",
    "the effect of intermediate meson - baryon states different from @xmath12 is also depict .",
    "the importance of multi - step processes is clear and confirms previous studies done in a similar framework .",
    "the model described in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite has already been used to study @xmath12 scattering and @xmath61 photoproduction reactions as presented in this contribution . in the near future",
    "we expect to extend these studies and perform a consistent study of meson - baryon scattering , single meson electro(photo ) production  @xcite and two - meson photoproduction .",
