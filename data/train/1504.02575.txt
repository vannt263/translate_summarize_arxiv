    "finite many - body systems ( e.g. , nuclei , small metallic grains , metallic clusters ) robustly maintain similar regularities , despite their different binding interactions .",
    "for example , they all present the odd - even staggering on their binding energies , which are , however , attributed to various mechanisms @xcite . particularly in nuclear systems , the nucleon - nucleon interactions numerically exhibit a  random \" pattern with no trace of symmetry groups , whereas nuclear spectra follow some robust dynamical features : the nuclear spectral fluctuation is universally observed @xcite ; low - lying spectra of even - even nuclei are orderly and systematically characterized by seniority , vibrational and rotational structures @xcite , beyond @xmath5 ground states without exception .    to demonstrate the insensitivity of these robust regularities to the interaction details , and to reveal its underlying origin , random interactions are employed to simulate ( or even introduce ) the variety and chaos into a finite many - body system .",
    "thus , the predominant behaviors in a random - interaction ensemble correspond to dynamical features in a realistic system .",
    "many efforts have been devoted along this direction @xcite .",
    "for instance , similarly to realistic even - even nuclei , the predominance of the @xmath6 ground states @xcite and collective band structures @xcite have been observed in random - interaction ensembles . however , there are only few attempts to study the robustness of nuclear quadrupole collectivity against the random interaction .",
    "this is partly because a random - interaction ensemble potentially gives weaker e2 transitions than a shell - model calculation with ",
    "realistic \" interactions @xcite .",
    "even so , some robust correlations about the e2 collectivity can be expected .",
    "for example , the alaga ratio between the quadrupole moment ( @xmath7 ) of the @xmath8 state and b(e2 , @xmath9 ) highlights both near - spherical shape and well deformed rotor in random - interaction ensembles @xcite ; ratios of e2 transition rates between yrast @xmath10 , @xmath8 and @xmath11 states are also correlated to the ratio of @xmath8 and @xmath11 excitation energies @xcite .     and @xmath12 matrix elements from table i of ref .",
    "@xcite ( i.e. , [ @xmath13 , @xmath14 plots scaled by @xmath15 ) . the @xmath16 parameterization defined in eq .",
    "( [ theta ] ) is illustrated in the red sector .",
    "the @xmath17 correlation is obvious along the @xmath18 direction ( the black dash diagonal line).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    this work further studies the robust correlation between @xmath7 values of the first two @xmath8 states , inspired by a recent experimental survey @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ q_exp ] , this survey demonstrated a global @xmath17 correlation across a wide range of masses , deformations , and @xmath8 energies .",
    "we will make use of random - interaction ensembles to provide an interacting - particle vision to this correlation , and search for other underlying @xmath7 correlations . the statistic analysis based on the elliott su(3 ) model @xcite and the mean - field hartree - bose theory @xcite",
    "is applied .",
    "in our random - interaction calculations , the single - particle - energy degree of freedom is switched off to avoid the interference from the shell - structure detail .",
    "the two - body interaction matrix element , on the other hand , is denoted by @xmath19 as usual , where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 represent the angular momenta of single - particle orbits ( half integer for fermions and integer for bosons ) , and the superscript @xmath24 labels the total angular momentum of the two - body configurations involved the interaction element . in our calculations , @xmath19 is randomized independently and gaussianly with @xmath25 , which insures the invariance of our random two - body interactions under arbitrary orthogonal transformations @xcite .",
    "all the possibilities of random interactions and their outputs via microscope - calculations construct the two - body random ensemble ( tbre ) @xcite .",
    "obviously , in the tbre , diagonal interaction elements potentially have larger magnitudes .    for the shell - model tbre in this work , four model spaces with",
    "either four or six valence protons in either @xmath3 or @xmath26 shell are considered , correspondingly to four nuclei : @xmath27si , @xmath28s , @xmath29cr and @xmath30fe . for the ibm1 tbre",
    ", @xmath3-boson spaces are constructed for nuclei with valence boson numbers @xmath3112 , 13 , 14 and 15 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 represents @xmath34 and @xmath35 bosons , respectively .",
    "it is noteworthy that a single calculation with random interactions does not match , and does not intend to match , to a realistic nucleus .",
    "it only presents a pseudo nucleus in the computational laboratory .",
    "thus , in this article , model spaces described above are named as corresponding pseudo nuclei for convenience .",
    "for example , the model space with four protons in the @xmath3 shell corresponds to pseudo @xmath27si .",
    "statistic properties of many random - interaction calculations for pseudo nuclei can be related to the robustness of dynamic features in realistic nuclear systems . to insure the statistic validity of our conclusions , 1 000 000 sets of random interactions",
    "are generated for each pseudo nucleus , and inputted into the shell - model or ibm1 calculations .",
    "if one calculation produces a @xmath6 ground state , @xmath7 matrix elements of @xmath8 and @xmath36 states will be calculated and recorded for the following statistic analysis .",
    "in the shell model , the @xmath7 matrix element of one @xmath37 state , @xmath38 , is defined conventionally as @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are single - particle creation and time - reversal operators at orbits @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively . a proportional @xmath7 correlation between the first two @xmath8 states",
    "is normally characterized by the ratio of @xmath44 .",
    "geometrically , such correlation also corresponds to a straight line with the polar angle , @xmath45 across the origin in the [ @xmath13 , @xmath14 plane .",

    "[ q_exp ] .    in this work ,",
    "we prefer the statistic analysis based on the polar angle @xmath16 over the @xmath44 ratio because of two reasons .",
    "firstly , the distribution of the @xmath44 ratio spreads widely , so that the statistic detail about @xmath48 correlation may be concealed . in particular , there robustly exists 8% probability of @xmath49 due to the predominance of weak quadruple collectivity , i.e. small @xmath50 , in the shell - model tbre @xcite .",
    "however , we intend as comprehensively as possible to present the statistic detail about the experimental @xmath51 correlation .",
    "the wide statistic range of the @xmath44 ratio may fails this intention . by converting the @xmath44 ratio to the @xmath16 value",
    ", the statistic range is limited between @xmath52 , and a clearer vision around the @xmath48 correlation can be obtained around @xmath53 .",
    "secondly , the @xmath16 parameterization intuitively provides a reasonable geometric standard of symmetric sampling . taking the @xmath48 correlation for example",
    ", there is actually no ( pseudo ) nucleus following exact @xmath48 relation in experiments or our tbre , and yet we can take @xmath54 as the sampling range to represent this correlation .",
    "one sees this sampling range indeed covers a symmetric area related to the @xmath48 correlation in the [ @xmath13 , @xmath14 plane . with the @xmath44 statistic , the determination of symmetric sampling range for one specifically @xmath7 correlation can be controversial or simply another representation of the @xmath16 parameterization .",
    "therefore , all the statistic , analyses , and discussions in this work are based on the @xmath16 value",
    ".     distributions from the experimental survey ( exp ) @xcite and the shell - model tbre .",
    "@xmath55 peaks are highlighted correspondingly to @xmath56 correlations , respectively .",

    "[ q_sm ] , we present @xmath16 distributions of four pseudo nuclei in the shell - model tbre compared with the experimental distribution from ref . @xcite",
    ". the experimental @xmath46 correlation is represented by the main peak around @xmath53 , which is also reproduced by the tbre .",
    "furthermore , several weak peaks around @xmath57 are also observed in both experimental data and random - interaction systems , corresponding to the @xmath58 correlation .    as proposed by ref .",
    "@xcite , nuclear rotor models can give the @xmath53 correlation , even although such correlation experimentally occurs in both rotational or non - rotational nuclei .",
    "therefore , we will further examine whether @xmath59 correlations is the symbol of the underlying rotational collectivity in tbre .",
    "firstly , we verify whether @xmath60 correlations accompany rotational spectra in the tbre .",
    "secondly , we search statistic signature of the random - interaction elements that provides the @xmath60 correlations , and trace such signature back to the microscopical hamiltonian of nuclear rotor model , namely the elliott su(3 ) hamiltonian .     distributions around @xmath60 correlations ( red circles and blue triangles , respectively ) compared with those in the whole shell - model tbre ( black squares ) .",

    "the @xmath65 distribution has an observable enhancement at @xmath69 with @xmath67 .",
    "namely , the @xmath70 correlation seems to partially originate from the seniority - like level scheme in @xmath28s space .",

    "on the other hand , @xmath65 distributions of u(5 ) peaks are dominated by @xmath85 , corresponding to a typical u(5 ) vibrational spectrum , which supports our u(5 ) assignment for this peak .",
    "our analysis with the @xmath3-boson mean - field theory starts with the @xmath3-boson coherent state for the ground band as @xmath86 value , is determined by minimizing the hamiltonian expectation value of this coherent state as @xmath87 where @xmath88 reaches the minimum of this equation ; @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 are linear combination of @xmath3-boson two - body interaction matrix elements as formulated in ref .",
    "we calculate @xmath93 values for all the interactions with spin-0@xmath94 ground states in the tbre , and perform frequency counting for calculated @xmath93 values .",

    "presents calculated @xmath102s .",
    "the u(5 ) peak only has a significant probability at @xmath103 , corresponding to the @xmath32-boson condensation .",
    "thus , @xmath37 states for the u(5 ) peak are constructed by replacing @xmath32 bosons with @xmath33 bosons in the @xmath32-boson condensation , which agrees with the quadrupole vibration described by the u(5 ) limit .",
    "this further confirms our u(5 ) characterization of this peak . on the other hand , the @xmath56 peaks both have large probabilities for @xmath104 , corresponding to the axially symmetric rotor at the su(3 ) limit .",
    "considering that the @xmath56 peaks also favor su(3 ) rotational spectra with @xmath105 in fig .",

    "conversely , we also derive @xmath56 correlations from the su(3 ) limit of the ibm1 . at the su(3 )",
    "limit , the @xmath8 state is from the ground band with ( @xmath106 , @xmath107 ) and @xmath108 ; yet , the @xmath36 state belongs to the ( @xmath109 , @xmath110 ) representation , which generates @xmath111 and @xmath112 bands with @xmath108 and 2 , respectively @xcite .",
    "thus , the @xmath36 is from either @xmath111 or @xmath112 band , which leads to two phase - different @xmath7 correlations @xmath113 for @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 are achieved , corresponding to @xmath58 and @xmath17 correlations , respectively .    in the shell - model tbre",

    "[ theta_ibm ] and table [ peak - fit ] .",
    "this is a major difference between behaviors of the @xmath7 correlations in shell - model and ibm1 tbres .",

    "i.e. the elliott model , the @xmath117 correlation normally emerges with two @xmath37 states from a single @xmath118 representation , which empirically provides a larger probability .",
    "however , in the @xmath3-boson space , both @xmath56 correlations require @xmath8 and @xmath36 states from two different @xmath118 representations , and thus have similar probabilities .",

    "phenomenologically , the anharmonic vibration may also provide the @xmath4 correlation , although its spectral behavior is not observed in the shell - model tbre .",
    "in particular , the invariance of under orthogonal transformation intrinsically provides the shell - model tbre more opportunity to restore part of su(3 ) properties , i.e. @xmath1 correlations , even though these @xmath7 correlations are insensitive to the su(3 ) rotational spectrum as expected based on the experimental survey @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", ibm1 @xmath1 correlations always favor low - lying rotational spectra , which indicates that the ibm is more strongly governed by the dynamic symmetry .",
    "the su(3 ) group reduction rule also qualitatively explains why the shell model more obviously favors the @xmath4 correlation compared with the ibm1 .",
    "low - lying @xmath7 correlations represent intrinsic nuclear collectivity , and thus are more sensitive to the wave - function detail than the spectrum .",
