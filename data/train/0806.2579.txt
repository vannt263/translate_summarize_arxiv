    "the structure adopted by a collection of particles is ultimately governed by the energetic interactions between the particles .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask what sort of structures are favoured by a given set of interactions , and also whether interactions can be chosen or manipulated in order to produce a particular target structure .",
    "the scope of both these questions is growing increasingly broad as it becomes possible to exert ever greater control over the shape and form of the interactions between molecular and colloidal building blocks @xcite .",
    "the motivation for seeking deeper understanding in these areas is the desire to design novel materials and supramolecular structures with unusual and useful properties .",
    "considerable structural variety is possible even for spherical particles and isotropic interparticle potentials .",
    "simple van der waals interactions between inert gas atoms promote near - spherical , highly - coordinated structures , favouring icosahedral packing for clusters @xcite and close - packed crystals in the bulk .",
    "however , these structures can be suppressed by introducing a repulsive barrier into the pair potential at a distance close to @xmath0 times the nearest neighbour separation @xcite . in clusters , potentials of this form",
    "further promote icosahedral local order , but lead to polytetrahedral structures @xcite , or to less compact shapes that are either elongated or contain holes @xcite . local maxima in the pair potential",
    "can arise , for example , from the combination of short - range depletion attraction between colloidal particles with partially screened long - range coulomb repulsion @xcite , in which case the accumulated charge of a growing cluster can effectively limit the size of aggregate that forms .",
    "it is also possible to favour less highly - coordinated order by careful design of isotropic pair potentials .",
    "for example , inverse statistical mechanical techniques can be used to derive isotropic potentials that favour crystalline but non - close - packed bulk structures , such as the diamond and wurtzite lattices @xcite .",
    "a vast range of structures become possible when either non - spherical particles or anisotropic interactions are considered .",
    "evolution has selected molecules with interactions that lead to the self - assembled structures that we observe in living matter , including pseudo one - dimensional filaments , two - dimensional membranes , tube - like channels and pores , and shell - like capsules .",
    "fascinating examples in the latter category are the capsids of viruses , many of which are spheroidal and are constructed from a specific number of copies of a small number of different proteins @xcite . it has long been known that the capsomers of some viruses can assemble _ in vitro _ into empty shells even in the absence of the viral genetic material @xcite , providing a powerful demonstration of how molecular shape and interactions dictate the structure of aggregates . for proteins , the symmetry and binding in oligomers",
    "is determined by the contacts between neighbours in the complex , and it is now becoming possible to engineer the quaternary structure by modifying the contact surface through mutations of the amino acid sequence @xcite .    drawing inspiration from nature , and encouraged by rapid advances in the synthesis of tailor - made building blocks , computational scientists are trying to understand the principles of self - assembly and how these can be used to build designed structures .",
    "explicit models of polyhedral shell assembly have shown how difficult this objective can be @xcite . while entropic and kinetic considerations are undoubtedly crucial for successful self - assembly , there is also a clear requirement for target structures to be energetically stable and kinetically accessible @xcite .",
    "a logical starting point is therefore to design building blocks with attractive sites or `` patches '' in geometries compatible with the target structure .",
    "monodisperse discrete objects , as well as continuous structures , such as sheets , can be constructed in this way @xcite .",
    "highly directional interactions can also be achieved through a non - uniform charge distribution in particles that remain neutral overall .",
    "for example , dipolar particles will endeavour to form chains , since the head - to - tail arrangement of two dipoles is low in energy and mechanically stable .",
    "the tendency to form chains is partially frustrated in the presence of competition for more compact arrangements arising from an isotropic van der waals or depletion attraction @xcite .",
    "a simple model incorporating these features is the stockmayer potential , consisting of particles with a lennard - jones ( lj ) site plus a central point dipole . by adjusting the relative strength of the lj and dipolar contributions , the energetically most stable morphology of the 13-particle stockmayer cluster changes in four stages from a distorted icosahedron to a closed ring @xcite .",
    "for slightly larger sizes , knots , links and coils emerge @xcite .",
    "van workum and douglas have investigated the self - assembly of chains in low - density stockmayer fluids @xcite , regarding the process as a form of reversible polymerisation .",
    "these authors have also considered a natural extension of the stockmayer potential to higher multipoles , in particular an lj site plus point quadrupole @xcite .",
    "quadrupole interactions favour the formation of extended two - dimensional sheets , which can produce tubes when the edges become connected .",
    "the lj - plus - multipole class of potentials therefore provides control over the preference for compact ( three - dimensional ) , sheet - like ( two - dimensional ) and chain - based ( one - dimensional ) structure in self - assembly .",
    "these tendencies compete with each other . in the present contribution",
    "we provide a systematic survey of the structure of small clusters of quadrupolar spheres in an attempt to identify and understand the structural motifs that emerge from the frustration between the isotropic and directional components of the potential .",
    "the quadrupolar sphere is modelled as an isotropic lennard - jones site with a point quadrupole of variable strength superimposed @xcite .",
    "the pair potential , which we denote as ljq , is of the form @xmath1\\\\ + v_{\\rm q}({\\bf r}_{ij},\\omega_i,\\omega_j),\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the vector from particle @xmath3 to @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the magnitude of this vector , and @xmath6 represents the orientational degrees of freedom of particle @xmath3 .",

    ".    we will need to perform local geometry optimisations using the ljq potentials , and have therefore derived and coded their analytic derivatives with respect to the cartesian position coordinates and the angular orientational variables .",
    "we performed unbiased searches for the global minima of clusters bound by the ljq potentials using the basin - hopping algorithm @xcite , in which a monte carlo simulation is run on a transformed potential energy surface ( pes ) by performing a local minimisation of the energy at each step .",
    "the local minimisation @xcite is key to the success of basin - hopping @xcite , and is a feature shared by other efficient methods of global optimisation for clusters , such as certain genetic algorithms @xcite .    for a given number of particles , @xmath36 , and quadrupole strength , @xmath37",
    ", several runs seeded from different random initial positions and orientations were performed .",
    "the number of monte carlo steps required to find a putative global minimum reliably in independent runs depends strongly on the size of the cluster and the strength of the quadrupole moment .",
    "it is also important to select a reasonable temperature for the accept / reject step in the basin - hopping runs . although the success of the method is not very sensitive to the temperature , it must be high enough for the search to escape from local traps , but not so high that we fail to sample the low - lying minima in each region sufficiently .",
    "a fixed reduced temperature of @xmath38 was often found to work well .    to generate a structural map for the clusters , it is necessary to explore the two - dimensional parameter space defined by the size of the cluster and the strength of the quadrupole .",
    "the straightforward approach of running basin - hopping on a grid of @xmath37 points for each @xmath36 would be inefficient , since a small change in @xmath37 will often lead only to a relaxation of the global minimum , with qualitative changes to a new structure occurring at larger intervals in @xmath37 .",
    "we have therefore devised a surveying scheme with an iterative element , designed to identify the values of @xmath37 where the identity of the global minimum changes for a given @xmath36 .",
    "the algorithm begins with thorough searches for the global potential energy minimum at two values of the quadrupole strength , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , that are far enough apart to lead to qualitatively different structures .",
    "these structures are then relaxed by local minimisation on a grid of @xmath37 points that lie between @xmath39 and @xmath40 , resulting in the correlation of the energy of each structure with @xmath37 . during this process",
    ", it is possible that one or both of the minima will disappear at some value of @xmath37 due to a catastrophe in the pes @xcite , leading to a sudden change in energy as the structure falls into a different basin of attraction . in this case ,",
    "a new basin - hopping run is performed at the @xmath37 where the catastrophe occurred and the scan in @xmath37 is continued .    eventually , the energies of the relaxed structures initiated from @xmath39 and @xmath40 cross at some quadrupole strength @xmath41 .",
    "new basin - hopping runs are then performed to identify the global minima at @xmath42 a little above and below the crossing point .",
    "if the basin - hopping run at @xmath43 returns the same structure and energy as the relaxed structure from @xmath39 , then we assume that this structure was the global minimum not only at @xmath39 and at @xmath43 , but also at all values of @xmath37 in the intervening range .",
    "in other words , we assume that there are no reentrant global minimum structures .",
    "this assumption is not only intuitively reasonable , given that @xmath37 continuously changes the potential from isotropic van der waals attraction to highly directional electrostatic interactions , but it is also borne out by careful checks of particular cases .",
    "the range @xmath44 to @xmath40 was treated analogously .",
    "since a local relaxation is much faster than a full basin - hopping run , this procedure is far more efficient than using basin - hopping afresh at each intermediate @xmath37 value .    if , on the other hand , the basin - hopping runs at @xmath42 return new structures with lower energy than the relaxed structures from @xmath39 and @xmath40 , then this global minimum supersedes them and was in turn relaxed at values of @xmath37 in both directions away from @xmath41 until the energy rose above those of the previous structures .",
    "a new check for the true global minimum must now be performed at this crossing point .",
    "the procedure was terminated when no lower minima were found at the crossing points of relaxed structures .",
    "hence , full basin - hopping runs need only be performed close to the locations where the identity of the global minimum changes .",

    "an important difference between the linear and square quadrupoles is demonstrated by the tetramers .",

    "although tube - like and shell - like structures do appear , they are collapsed into what would be the central space in the square quadrupole equivalents .",
    "this ability to distort , or inability to support a hollow interior , is a result of the axial symmetry of the linear quadrupole . a square array of linear quadrupoles , such as the one depicted in fig .",

    "global optimisation is most challenging when the competing influences are closely balanced , i.e. , for intermediate strengths of the quadrupole in this work .",
    "obtaining reproducible lowest - energy structures was significantly more difficult for the quadrupolar potential than for equivalent dipolar stockmayer potential @xcite .",
    "this observation , together with the multiplicity of minima that were found to have virtually identical positions but different orientations of the quadrupoles , hints at a complex potential energy surface in certain parts of the @xmath88 parameter space .",
    "confirmation and further exploration of this complexity would require a more comprehensive analysis of the energy landscape @xcite .",
    "the landscape approach would provide information not only on the number of competing structures , but also on the barriers separating them and the rearrangement mechanisms that interconvert them .",
    "this information would provide a starting point for investigating the thermal stability and dynamic properties of the clusters , as well as the routes by which they might self - assemble .",
    "the various families of structures have their own `` magic '' numbers at which a particular shape is complete and the landscape is probably minimally frustrated @xcite .",

    "for example , it has recently been shown that dipolar colloids can be encouraged to form more interconnected gel - like networks by a slight extension of the dipole @xcite . from studies of models of patchy spheres with fixed maximum valency",
    "it is now known that the average coordination number of the particles in a gel has important consequences for the structure of the gel and for the underlying phase behaviour of the fluid from which it forms @xcite .",
    "the present work suggests that the average coordination number could be finely tuned either by adding a weak point quadrupole to point dipolar particles , or by using a mixture of dipolar and quadrupolar spheres .",
    "hence , multipolar particles could be an appealing alternative to patchy colloids for realizing and exploring reversible gels @xcite ."
