    "the subject of instabilities in molecular dynamics ( md ) integrators is not new .",
    "studies of the phenomenon for the case of lattice qcd have been reported in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the lattices used were small ( @xmath0 sites ) .",
    "the onset of instabilities was investigated as a function of the integration step size ( @xmath1 ) for heavy and light quark masses . for both masses studied the instabilities set in at some critical step size .",
    "the critical value of @xmath1 was smaller for the lighter mass than for the heavier one . however , in both cases @xmath1 was still so large that the energy change ( @xmath2 ) from the step size induced errors along an md trajectory was sufficiently great to make simulations impractical in the unstable region of parameter space anyway .",
    "our study @xcite using larger lattices and quark masses that are relatively light ( by current standards ) encountered instabilities at step sizes that are small enough to be relevant for large scale simulations .",
    "our motivation to summarise these results is to highlight the impact these instabilities may have on future simulations using md integrators as components , in particular hmc .",
    "this article is organised as follows . in section [",
    "s : sho ] we demonstrate the instability in the simple harmonic oscillator ( sho ) system . at this point",
    "we will restate the hypothesis of @xcite to explain the onset of the instability .",
    "we present our main results in section [ s : ourdata ] and show that they are completely consistent with this hypothesis .",
    "finally in section [ s : conclusions ] we will draw our conclusions .",
    "in the case of the sho system a leapfrog update can be written as : @xmath3 = \\left [ \\hspace{-5pt } \\begin{array}{cc }         1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\left ( \\omega \\delta \\tau \\right)^2 & \\omega \\delta \\tau \\\\        -\\omega \\delta \\tau + \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\omega \\delta \\tau \\right)^3 & 1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\left ( \\omega \\delta \\tau \\right)^2        \\end{array } \\hspace{-5pt } \\right ] \\left [ \\hspace{-5pt } \\begin{array}{c } q(t ) \\\\",
    "p(t ) \\end{array } \\hspace{-5pt } \\right ] \\label{e : shoupdate}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the coordinates and conjugate momenta , @xmath6 is md time and @xmath7 is the angular frequency .",
    "the eigenvalues of the matrix in ( [ e : shoupdate ] ) are @xmath8    when @xmath9 the inverse cosine in ( [ e : eigval ] ) is real , the eigenvalues are complex , and the phase space trajectories describe ellipses . however , when @xmath10 , the inverse cosine becomes imaginary , and one eigenvalue is greater than one . at this point",
    "the phase space trajectories become hyperbolic , and the energy change along a trajectory grows exponentially .",
    "the hypothesis of @xcite is that _ the short distance modes of an asymptotically free quantum field theory behave like a collection of loosely coupled sho modes_. it is then anticipated that the md integration of lattice qcd will go unstable when the highest frequency mode goes unstable .",
    "we note that in the sho example @xmath7 plays the role of the md force @xmath11 .",
    "hence we surmise that for qcd the instability will occur when the combination @xmath12 reaches a critical value .",
    "furthermore , we expect that the fermionic contribution to the force will increase in some manner with the inverse quark mass .",
    "this suggests that as the quark masses are decreased , the @xmath12 term will reach its critical value for smaller values of @xmath1 .",
    "this indeed is exactly what is reported in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our numerical computations were carried out using 10 lattice configurations from a ukqcd lattice computation @xcite .",
    "the lattices were picked evenly spaced from a larger ensemble .",
    "the lattice volume was @xmath13 sites , and the physical parameters for the ensemble were @xmath14 for the gauge coupling , @xmath15 for the hopping parameter and @xmath16 for the @xmath17improvement coefficient @xcite .",
    "these parameters correspond to a regime where the ratio of the pseudoscalar to vector masses is @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "we evolved the configurations for unit length md trajectories using a variety of step sizes at a variety of @xmath19 values . along each trajectory",
    "we computed @xmath2 as well as the 2-norms and @xmath20 norms of the gauge and fermionic contributions to the md force ( @xmath21,@xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 ) averaged over all the time steps along the trajectory .    in figure [",
    "f : forces_am ] we show the results of fitting the fermionic force norms ( averaged over configurations ) to the fit ansatz : @xmath25 in order to check that the forces increase in some inverse manner with the quark mass . to calculate @xmath26 we used the formula @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the critical value of @xmath19 corresponding to the massless limit of the pion . in our fits",
    "we have left @xmath28 as a free parameter , however to determine @xmath26 for the axes of figure [ f : forces_am ] we used the value @xmath29 , determined from spectroscopy on the ensemble @xcite .",
    "one can see from figure [ f : forces_am ] that the values of @xmath30 are negative for both the 2norm and the @xmath20norm indicating that the forces do indeed grow inversely with @xmath26 .",
    "the fits for @xmath28 are consistent with the spectroscopic determinations indicating that the forces will diverge as @xmath31 .     and @xmath24 vs @xmath26 .",
    "]    [ f : forces_am ]    in figure [ f : forces_dtau ] , we plot the variation of the force norms and @xmath2 against the step size @xmath1 at a fixed value of @xmath32 for a single configuration . it can be seen that at a value of about @xmath33 , the fermionic forces start increasing and that @xmath2 increases exponentially indicating the onset of the instability .",
    "the gauge contributions to the force norms seem to show no change in behaviour .    -norms ( middle ) and corresponding values of @xmath2 ( top ) vs @xmath1 . ]",
    "[ f : forces_dtau ]    the @xmath20norms grow at a larger rate than the 2norm . as the @xmath20norm is the largest absolute value contribution to the fermionic force , it plays a similar role to the highest frequency mode of a corresponding set of loosely coupled shos whereas the 2norm of the force can be likened to the behaviour of the corresponding bulk modes .",
    "hence this result is consistent with the earlier hypothesis , that the highest frequency modes drive the system unstable .",
    "( bottom ) , @xmath23 ( middle ) , @xmath2 ( top ) vs @xmath19 , for two values of the step size : @xmath34 ( circles ) and @xmath35 ( squares ) . ]",
    "[ f : forces_kappa ]    in figure [ f : forces_kappa ] we show the behaviour of @xmath24 , @xmath23 and @xmath2 against the hopping parameter @xmath19 for @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "when @xmath34 the system is completely stable for all values of @xmath19 ( for this single configuration ) ; however , for @xmath36 the fermionic force norm rises sharply for @xmath32 accompanied by a large increase in @xmath2 signalling the onset of the instability .",
    "this again is consistent with our earlier hypothesis that instabilities set in when the @xmath37 term reaches a critical value .",
    "we have exhibited the onset of an instability in the leapfrog md integration scheme , used in hmc simulations and inexact simulation algorithms .",
    "the instability is manifest in the leapfrog scheme for a simple sho system .",
    "we have also presented numerical evidence demonstrating that the instability is present also in lattice qcd systems .",
    "we have shown that our data is consistent with the hypothesis that the instability occurs when the @xmath12 term in the leapfrog equations reaches some critical value , and that the fermionic contribution to the force increases with decreasing quark mass .",
    "we have shown that as quark masses become lighter the instability sets in at smaller values of @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , for simulations with light dynamical quarks the instability sets in at values of @xmath1 that are small enough to be relevant to large scale numerical simulations .",
    "we anticipate that the major stumbling block for simulations with lighter quark masses will not come from `` exceptional '' configurations , where the value of @xmath19 may become supercritical for some configurations , but rather from the onset of the instability which we expect to set in before @xmath19 can become supercritical .",
    "the instability problem is exponentially bad , but can be controlled easily by reducing @xmath1 .",
    "we are concerned for simulations with inexact algorithms , where the instability may be hard to detect as there is no @xmath2 to monitor , and full finite step size extrapolations are seldom made .",
    "finally we wish to mention that neither the use of higher order integration schemes nor the use of double precision arithmetic are expected to alleviate the instability problem @xcite .",
