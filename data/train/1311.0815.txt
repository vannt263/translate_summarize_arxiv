    "historically , the taming of singularities in classical field models has driven a great deal of research .",
    "a particularly elegant example is the nonlinear extension of maxwell electrodynamics introduced by born and infeld @xcite to remove the divergence of both the coulomb field and the self - energy of point particles . in this _ determinantal _ form of the classical action , the modified field ( the _ bion _ @xcite ) , is everywhere bounded but generated by a distributional source .",
    "this specific form of nonlinear electrodynamics arises in the low - energy limit of certain string theories @xcite .",
    "recovering the idea of the determinantal form of the gravitational action suggested by eddington @xcite , an eddington - inspired born - infeld action ( eibi ) for the gravitational field has been introduced recently @xcite . in order to avoid troubles with higher - order derivatives and ghosts ,",
    "eibi gravity is formulated in the palatini approach , which means that metric and connection are regarded as physically independent entities @xcite .",
    "this implies that the connection is determined by the field equations , not constrained _ a priori _ to any particular form .",
    "the eibi theory is a modification of the einstein - hilbert action which might allow to remove the appearance of singularities , thus avoiding an undesirable feature of einstein s theory of general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "the eibi theory is expected to be in agreement with gr at energies well below the planck scale , which represents the regime where quantum gravitational effects are expected to begin to become important and modify the classical description .",
    "the naturalness of eibi gravity has been argued on the basis of canonical procedures to construct lagrangian densities with second - order field equations @xcite .",
    "moreover , this theory is able to avoid cosmological singularities @xcite , has been employed to study properties of dark matter and dark energy @xcite , in the coupling to several kinds of fields @xcite , as an alternative to inflation @xcite , and to explore the structure of compact stars @xcite . when coupled to a perfect fluid with a given equation of state , it has been found that the theory can be interpreted as gr coupled again to a perfect fluid , but with a modified equation of state @xcite .",
    "though in its determinantal form the eibi theory may appear as lacking an intuitive motivation , here we show that when applied to elementary systems such as electric fields generated by point - like sources ( or elementary particles ) , the theory boils down to a simple quadratic extension of gr .",
    "this simplification occurs when the stress - energy tensor of the matter possesses certain algebraic properties @xcite , namely , when it has two double eigenvalues .",
    "we take advantage of this property to explore in detail the internal structure of the electrovacuum solutions of the theory and find that the central singularity is generically replaced by a wormhole supported by the electric field .",
    "the wormhole structure turns out to be crucial to regularize the total energy stored in the electric field , which occurs in a way that resembles the original born - infeld electromagnetic theory . among the solutions of the theory ,",
    "there exist a family ( characterized by a certain charge - to - mass ratio ) for which curvature invariants are finite everywhere .",
    "these solutions , whose mass exactly coincides with the energy contained in the electric field , lose the event horizon when the number of charges drops below a critical value , @xmath0 , yielding remnants which are not affected by hawking s quantum instability . the mass spectrum of these remnants can be lowered from the planck scale ( @xmath1 gev ) down to the tev scale if quantum matter corrections are considered .",
    "these results are derived in a four - dimensional scenario .",
    "the action of the eibi theory with matter can be written as @xmath2 + s_m , \\label{eq : action}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the determinant of the space - time metric @xmath4 , @xmath5 represents the determinant of a rank - two tensor @xmath6 , @xmath7 is a constant , @xmath8 is a ( small ) parameter with dimensions of length squared , @xmath9 is the ricci tensor , @xmath10 is the riemann tensor of the connection @xmath11 , which is _ a priori _ independent of the metric ( palatini formalism ) , and @xmath12 is the matter action .",
    "the meaning of the parameter @xmath13 can be obtained from the field equations and from the leading - order terms of an expansion in @xmath14 , which reads @xmath15 \\nonumber \\\\ & -&\\frac{1}{2\\kappa^2 } \\int d^4x \\sqrt{-g } \\frac{\\epsilon}{2 } \\left(\\frac{-r^2}{2 } + r_{\\mu\\nu}r^{\\mu\\nu}\\right)+ s_m \\label{eq : graction } \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , when @xmath18 the leading - order in ( [ eq : graction ] ) coincides with gr plus a cosmological constant term , with @xmath19 . the action ( [ eq : action ] ) can thus be seen as a high - energy modification of einstein s theory , including a cosmological constant as long as @xmath20 .",
    "variation of ( [ eq : action ] ) with respect to metric and connection leads to @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the inverse of @xmath23 . to obtain these equations",
    "we have assumed vanishing torsion , @xmath24}=0 $ ] , as well as @xmath25}=0 $ ] , which guarantees the existence of volume invariants preserved by the theory @xcite .",
    "the connection equation ( [ eq : connection ] ) is formally identical to that found in the palatini version of gr and implies that @xmath26 can be written as the levi - civita connection of @xmath23 , which can be seen as an auxiliary metric tensor associated with the independent connection .",
    "similarly as in other palatini theories , the relation between @xmath23 and @xmath4 is algebraic and given by @xmath27 where we have used a hat to denote matrix representation and have defined @xmath28 , with @xmath29 denoting the matrix @xmath30 .",
    "this definition implies @xmath31 . using this notation and eq.([eq : metric ] ) , one can easily verify that @xmath32 where @xmath33_\\mu}^\\nu\\equiv",
    "t^{\\nu \\alpha}g_{\\alpha \\mu}$ ] .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma - t ] ) allows to obtain the relation between @xmath4 and @xmath23 once the matter sources have been specified .",
    "the field equations referred to the metric @xmath23 can be written in a very compact and convenient form noting that @xmath34 can be written as @xmath35 .",
    "using eq.([eq : qandg ] ) we find that @xmath36 , and taking eq.([eq : sigma - t ] ) we finally get @xmath37 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath38 , and we have used the fact that the gravity action in ( [ eq : action ] ) can be written as @xmath39 with @xmath40 .",
    "it is worth noting that the representation of the field equations given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rmn - h ] ) seems to be very general , since it is also valid for other families of palatini theories with lagrangians of the form @xmath41 and @xmath42 , which include gr as a particular case ( with @xmath43 ) .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : rmn - h ] ) one clearly sees that the metric @xmath23 satisfies a system of second - order differential equations with the matter sources on the right - hand side ( recall from ( [ eq : sigma - t ] ) that @xmath44 $ ] ) . since @xmath23 is algebraically related to @xmath4 through eq.([eq : qandg ] ) , it follows that @xmath4 also satisfies second - order equations . on the other hand ,",
    "it is easy to see that in vacuum , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , @xmath4 and @xmath23 are identical up to a constant conformal factor and that @xmath47 , which is equivalent to @xmath48 , thus confirming that @xmath49 plays the role of an effective cosmological constant in the full theory . since the vacuum theory is equivalent to gr with a cosmological constant , no ghost - like instabilities are present in the theory , which is a rather general property of palatini theories .",
    "we now couple our gravity theory to an electromagnetic field with action @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the field strength tensor . assuming a spherically symmetric and static electric field , without loss of generality we can choose coordinates such that the line element becomes @xmath52 it is sometimes useful to use the function @xmath53 as a radial coordinate , which turns ( [ eq : ds2 ] ) into @xmath54 .",
    "this replacement is possible as long as the relation between the coordinate @xmath55 and the radial function @xmath56 is monotonic . for reasons that will become clear later",
    ", we use @xmath55 instead of @xmath53 in our analysis . with this choice of coordinates",
    ", one can verify that @xmath57 is the only non - zero component of @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is an integration constant .",
    "this leads to @xmath60 , which inserted in ( [ eq : sigma - t ] ) yields @xmath61 the field equations ( [ eq : rmn - h ] ) then become @xmath62 the strategy now consists on solving for @xmath23 and then use ( [ eq : qandg ] ) to obtain @xmath4 . to proceed",
    ", we write a line element for @xmath23 , which according to ( [ eq : qandg ] ) and ( [ eq : ds2 ] ) takes the form    @xmath63    and rewrite it as    @xmath64    where we have defined @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 . plugging this ansatz into ( [ eq : rmn ] ) ,",
    "we find that @xmath68 is a constant . with the typical ansatz @xmath69",
    "we obtain @xmath70 where the relation @xmath71 , which follows from @xmath72 , has been used .",
    "this relation also allows to find that @xmath73 .",
    "we thus conclude that the line element ( [ eq : ds2 ] ) is completely determined by @xmath74 with @xmath75 given by the integration of eq.([eq : mr ] ) .",
    "note that , though this solution is formally equivalent to that obtained by baados and ferreira in @xcite , in the following sections we shall discuss the physical properties of those solutions with @xmath76 .",
    "therefore the claims of @xcite regarding the presence of singularities in this theory when @xmath77 do not apply in our case , as we will explicitly show below . for a more detailed discussion on the influence of signs of the parameters in the theory see @xcite .",
    "to discuss the physics behind the above solutions , we note that eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rmn - h ] ) , ( [ eq : sigma+- ] ) , ( [ eq : mr ] ) , and ( [ eq : adxdr ] ) _ exactly _ coincide with those corresponding to the quadratic palatini theory @xmath78 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & s_m\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the identifications @xmath79 and @xmath80 [ compare with eq.([eq : graction ] ) ] .",
    "the reason for this equivalence lies on the algebraic properties of the action ( [ eq : action ] ) .",
    "given the linear relation between @xmath81 and @xmath82 , in a basis in which @xmath81 is diagonal the matrix @xmath83 will also be diagonal . if @xmath83 has two double eigenvalues ( in our case @xmath84 $ ] ) then the fourth order polynomial defined by @xmath85 turns into the second order polynomial appearing in ( [ eq : quadratic ] ) when the squared root is evaluated .",
    "note that this quadratic polynomial coincides exactly with the series expansion of eq .",
    "( [ eq : graction ] ) , thus implying that all other higher - order terms vanish identically when @xmath83 has this structure .",
    "the intimate relation existing between the quadratic palatini theory and the eibi theory can be used to shed useful new light on the physics of the corresponding solutions . to see this ,",
    "let us focus on the case @xmath86 , with @xmath87 some small length scale , for which exact solutions can be found for arbitrary @xmath13 @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we consider here only the case @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath75 appearing in ( [ eq : adxdr ] ) can be written as @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is an integration constant representing the scharzschild mass of the uncharged case , while    @xmath91    is a dimensionless constant that controls the charge - to - mass ratio , and @xmath92 encodes the electric field contribution . for convenience ,",
    "we replace @xmath90 and @xmath59 by the length scales @xmath93 and @xmath94 , and measure the radial function @xmath95 in units of @xmath96 by defining @xmath97 . for @xmath98 , @xmath99 leads to the expected gr limit @xmath100 and , therefore , does not exhibit any pathological behavior theories ( see @xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "we support the view that when curvature divergences arise , a refined ( microscopic ) description of the troublesome region might help better understand their physical significance . in this sense",
    ", the absence of such pathologies in elementary charged systems , as found here , suggests that the results of @xcite might be an artifact of the approximations employed in the continuum description of statistical / macroscopic systems .",
    "in fact , since a star is made out of elementary particles , our results indicate that nothing special should happen as the outermost regions are approached , where the effective separation between particles increases and the  isolated - particle description \" of its constituents becomes more and more accurate",
    ". the average energy density and gradients in those regions can not be larger than in the region close to an individual particle because the volumes involved differ by orders of magnitude .",
    "in our view , therefore , a microscopic description of a stellar surface , seen as a collection of elementary particles , seems to be free of the pathologies described in @xcite . as another way out of this problem ,",
    "it has been recently argued @xcite that when the gravitational backreaction on the matter dynamics at the star surface is considered , the effective equation of state gets modified with the consequence that surfaces are no longer singular . ] . for @xmath101 , however , the geometry strongly departs from the low energy limit represented by gr . to understand the relevance of this region",
    ", one should look at the behavior of the function @xmath102 : @xmath103 for @xmath98 the relation between @xmath104 and @xmath55 is linear , but @xmath104 reaches a minimum at @xmath105 .",
    "this minimum ( or bounce ) of the radial function @xmath106 is a clear signal of the presence of a wormhole .",
    "in fact , eq.([eq : z(x ) ] ) can be integrated to get the curve shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bounce ] , where @xmath107 if @xmath108 and @xmath109 if @xmath110 .     and @xmath111 ( with @xmath112 ) .",
    "the wormhole throat is at the minimum of @xmath106 ( maximum of @xmath113 ) .",
    "[ fig : bounce],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    therefore , our space - time can be seen as consisting on two identical pieces connected through a ( spherical ) hole ( the wormhole throat ) of area @xmath114 . around @xmath115 ,",
    "@xmath116 can be expanded as @xmath117 where @xmath118 is an integration constant . with @xmath116 and @xmath106",
    "known , the geometry can be explored in detail .",
    "one then finds that , in general , there exist curvature divergences at @xmath119 , being the leading order dominated by @xmath120 in the case of @xmath121 and @xmath122 ( which contrasts with the much stronger divergences found in gr , @xmath123 ) .",
    "however , if the charge - to - mass ratio defined by the constant @xmath124 is tuned to the value @xmath125 , the @xmath119 divergences disappear yielding a completely regular geometry .",
    "one can now wonder about the nature of the sources that generate the charge @xmath59 and the mass @xmath90 that characterize our solutions .",
    "as first shown by misner and wheeler @xcite , an electric flux through a wormhole can define by itself an electric charge without the need for sources of the electric field .",
    "therefore , the charge @xmath59 appearing in our solutions is entirely given by the electric flux through any two - surface @xmath126 enclosing one of the sides of the wormhole , i.e. ,    @xmath127    where @xmath128 is the two - form dual to faraday s tensor .",
    "this charge is conserved as long as the topology does not change .    the existence of a wormhole where one would naively expect to find the sources poses a more severe challenge to identify the origin of the mass @xmath90 .",
    "a tempting guess would be to see @xmath90 as related to the energy stored in the electric field .",
    "this idea , however , seems in conflict with the results from minkowski space - time , where the energy of a point - like charged field is defined as @xmath129 , and diverges as @xmath130 . historically , this divergence was circumvented by replacing maxwell electrodynamics ( [ eq : maxwell ] ) by born - infeld theory @xcite , whose lagrangian reads , in determinantal form @xmath131 this modification yields a total finite energy for the electromagnetic field ,    @xmath132    where @xmath133 .",
    "given that in our gravitational model the function @xmath53 is bounded to @xmath134 , the electric energy could be somehow regularized by the non - trivial topological structure of the space - time .",
    "since for an electric field in minkowski space the action can be written as @xmath135 , to estimate the total electric energy in a gravitational scenario we propose to evaluate the total action as a means to get @xmath136 . by doing this , we find that    @xmath137    where @xmath138 . evaluating this integral",
    ", we find that @xmath139 . with simple manipulations",
    ", one finds that the total energy can be written as @xmath140 , where the factor @xmath141 stems from the need to integrate on both sides of the wormhole . remarkably , this result is finite regardless of the value of @xmath124 , which implies that the total energy is insensitive to the presence of curvature divergences .",
    "we note that these objects , with their charge having a topological origin and their mass being generated by the electric field , naturally realize the idea of _ geon _ ( self - consistent solutions of the sourceless gravito - electromagnetic field equations ) originally introduced by wheeler @xcite .",
    "when @xmath142 , from eq.([eq : delta1 ] ) , it is easily seen that the mass spectrum can be written as @xmath143 where @xmath144 represents the number of charges ( with @xmath145 being the electron charge ) , @xmath146 ( with @xmath147 the fine structure constant ) is the _ critical number of charges _ and plays an important role in the existence or not of event horizons [ see paragraph below ] , @xmath148 is the planck mass , and @xmath149 is the planck length .",
    "it is worth noting that defining the length scale @xmath150 , we can write the expression for @xmath151 given above as    @xmath152    which , up to a factor @xmath153 , is identical to ( [ eq : massspectrum ] ) with the replacement of the electromagnetic scale @xmath154 by the gravitational scale @xmath87 .",
    "remarkably , ( [ eq : massspectrum ] ) was derived using the maxwell electromagnetic lagrangian .",
    "thus , besides regularizing the geometry , the eibi gravitational theory also regularizes the matter sector in a way almost identical to its electromagnetic counterpart .",
    "a very important aspect of the @xmath142 solutions is that , as can be graphically verified ( see @xcite for details ) , for @xmath155 there is no event horizon , which implies stability of that sector of the theory against hawking radiation . for @xmath156",
    "the horizon exists and its location almost coincides with the prediction of gr .",
    "this means that black holes , understood as objects with an event horizon , can be continuously connected with horizonless configurations lying in the lowest part of the charge and mass spectrum .",
    "such states can be naturally identified as black hole remnants and their existence could have deep theoretical implications for the information loss problem and the hawking evaporation process @xcite .",
    "note , in addition , that for these remnants the surface @xmath119 is timelike and @xmath157 coincides with the action of a point - like particle at rest , which suggests that they possess particle - like properties .",
    "in order to test the robustness of the results obtained so far against quantum corrections in the matter sector , one can work within the effective lagrangians approach and consider the coupling of the eibi gravity model to some nonlinear theory of electrodynamics .",
    "the born - infeld electromagnetic lagrangian ( [ eq : bi ] ) is a well - motivated choice which , in turn , allows to find exact analytical solutions @xcite .",
    "one then finds that the global qualitative picture provided by maxwell s theory is preserved but with relevant quantitative differences .",
    "in particular , following the same procedure as in the maxwell case , the mass spectrum ( [ eq : massspectrum ] ) turns now into @xmath158 where @xmath159 .",
    "if the quantum effects of the matter manifest themselves much earlier than the quantum effects of gravity , i.e , if @xmath160 , then @xmath161 may become much smaller than @xmath90 . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath162 and @xmath163 is pushed to the limits of validity of the effective lagrangians scheme of quantum electrodynamics , @xmath164 , then @xmath165 and the mass spectrum for @xmath161 becomes @xmath166 orders of magnitude smaller than the original @xmath90 .",
    "this means that the mass spectrum may drop from @xmath167 gev down to @xmath168 gev . though more accurate descriptions of the matter sector might alter these numbers",
    ", the fact is that new quantum gravity phenomenology within the reach of current particle accelerators arises within a purely four - dimensional scenario .",
    "we have shown that for spherically symmetric charged systems eibi theory recovers the gr predictions for @xmath169 . the theory , however , changes the microstructure of the space - time replacing the gr singularity by a wormhole . though curvature divergences may exist at @xmath170 , their role is uncertain , since they affect neither the properties of the flux through the wormhole nor the finiteness of the total electric energy .",
    "the theory makes definite predictions about the existence of black hole remnants and their mass spectrum , with nontrivial implications for the hawking evaporation process , the information loss problem , and potentially new dark matter candidates @xcite .",
