    "ultraviolet ( uv ) satellite for interstellar clouds are significantly lower than in the sun . based on the strong correlation between the depletions of these elements and the condensation temperatures at which they are incorporated into solid grains in stellar atmospheres and nebulae , field ( 1974 ) proposed that the elements missing from the gas phase must have condensed into dust grains . assuming the interstellar reference abundances to be the same as the accepted solar abundances at the time ( cameron 1973 ) , greenberg ( 1974 ) compared the observed interstellar depletions with the abundances of the dust - forming elements required to account for the observed visual extinction .",
    "he found that a substantial amount of the intermediate - weight elements o , c , and n was unaccounted for by the interstellar gas and dust whereas the heavier elements si , mg and fe were underabundant .",
    "snow & witt ( 1996 ) compiled the elemental abundances of early b stars and young f and g stars and found that their abundances are just @xmath05070% of the then accepted solar abundances of anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) .",
    "they argued that , due to their young ages , the photospheric abundances of unevolved b stars and young f and g stars are more representative of the interstellar composition than the 4.6-billion - year - old sun .",
    "if the interstellar abundances are indeed subsolar , the original question of a surplus of missing , unaccountable elements posed by greenberg ( 1974 ) then turned into a shortage of raw materials for making the dust to account for the observed extinction .",
    "this was most pronounced for carbon . whereas published values for the sun range from @xmath6_\\odot}\\approx350{\\,{\\rm ppm}}$ ] to @xmath7470@xmath1 , where ppm stands for parts per million , snow & witt ( 1995 ) derived a c / h abundance of @xmath0225@xmath1 for galactic stars . with the gas - phase abundance of @xmath6_{\\rm gas}}\\approx140{\\,{\\rm ppm}}$ ] ( cardelli et al .",

    "2013 ) which all require @xmath6_{\\rm dust}}>200{\\,{\\rm ppm}}$ ] to be locked up in carbonaceous dust .",
    "note that the refined studies of the solar abundances since anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) all led to a gradual , downward revision such that the derived solar abundances were no longer substantially higher than that of b stars , and hence the c crisis remains unalleviated with the new solar and b - star abundances .",
    "it is worth noting that lodders ( 2003 ) argued that the currently observed solar photospheric abundances must be lower than those of the proto - sun because heavy elements have settled toward the sun s interior since the time of the sun s formation some 4.6gyr ago .",
    "she further argued that the protosolar abundances are more representative of the solar system elemental abundances .",
    "the depletion of oxygen is also problematic . unlike c of which",
    "the depletion is insufficient to account for the observed extinction , the major solid - phase reservoirs of o in the diffuse interstellar medium ( ism )  silicates and metal oxides  are insufficient to account for the total o / h abundance missing from the gas phase .",
    "jenkins ( 2009 ) examined the relative proportions of 17 individual elements that are incorporated into dust along 243 different galactic sightlines .",
    "he found that the depletion of o in the diffuse ism far exceeds the consumption of o by silicates and metallic oxides , except for low - density regions with little depletions .",
    "this is insensitive to the adopted reference abundance since the approach taken by jenkins ( 2009 ) was based on differential depletions rather than absolute values .",
    "whittet ( 2010b ) investigated the depletions of o over a wide range of environments from the tenuous intercloud medium and diffuse clouds to dense clouds where h@xmath2o ice is present .",
    "he found that as much as @xmath0160@xmath1 of o / h is unaccounted for at the interface between diffuse and dense phases , again , independent of the choice of reference abundances .",

    "for @xmath4 ice grains to be considered as a viable component of the diffuse ism , they should satisfy the constraints placed by the observed extinction from the far - uv to the ir , including the absence of the 3.1@xmath5 absorption feature of @xmath4 ice .",
    "the observed uv / optical interstellar extinction can be characterized by a single parameter @xmath24 ( cardelli et al .",

    "iso _ and _ spitzer _ since numerous observations suggest that the mid - ir extinction at @xmath32 is flat or `` gray '' for both diffuse and dense environments ( see figure  [ fig : irext ] ) , including the galactic center ( lutz 1999 , nishiyama et al .",

    "all these observations appear to suggest an `` universally '' flat mid - ir extinction law , with little dependence on environments .",
    "we construct an `` observed '' extinction curve for the diffuse ism as follows : ( i ) for @xmath33 , we take the galactic average of @xmath34 as parameterized by ccm and divide it into 95 wavelengths , equally - spaced in @xmath35 ; ( ii ) for the mid - ir extinction at @xmath36 , we first obtain a weighted `` average '' from the observed extinction shown in figure  [ fig : irext ] , with twice as much weight given to the diffuse sightlines toward the galactic center , aliphatic c  h absorption feature which is absent in dense regions ( sandford et al .  1991 , pendleton et al .  1994 , tielens et al .",

    "they derived an average photodesorption yield of @xmath111 .",
    "this gives a photosputtering lifetime of @xmath112 for @xmath4 ice grains of @xmath90 at @xmath108 .",
    "moreover , andersson et al .",
    "( 2006 ) modeled the photodesorption process at the atomic level by simulating the interaction between photons of @xmath089.5@xmath110 and ice surfaces .",
    "they estimated the photodesorption yield to be @xmath113 for amorphous ice .",
    "this leads to a photosputtering lifetime of @xmath114 for @xmath4 ice grains of @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , it seems likely that the diffuse - phase @xmath3m - sized @xmath4 ice grains are continuously replenished on a timely fashion by the dense - phase materials through the turnover of molecular clouds within a timescale of @xmath91@xmath0@xmath92@xmath93 before they are destroyed by photosputtering in the diffuse ism .",
    "in contrast , a sub-@xmath3m - sized ice grain ( coated on a silicate or graphite core ) responsible for the 3.1@xmath5 absorption feature in dense clouds will be quickly removed by photosputtering in diffuse clouds at a rate faster than that of an @xmath90 ice grain by a factor of @xmath0@xmath115 .",
    "finally , we note that the `` missing '' o atoms do not _ all _ have to be tied up in @xmath4 ice grains .",
    "as mentioned earlier , some of the `` missing '' o atoms could be hidden in organic refractories ( whittet 2010b ) . on the other hand",
    ", the observed flat extinction at @xmath038@xmath5 could also _ partly _ be caused by other dust components , e.g. , @xmath3m - sized graphite ( see wang , li , & jiang 2015 ) .",
    "while the ism seems to be short of the element c to form a sufficient amount of carbonaceous dust ( together with silicate dust ) to account for the observed extinction , the element o seems overabundant and as many as @xmath0160 o atoms ( per 10@xmath116 h atoms ) are unaccounted for by their presence in gas and dust .",
    "we have examined the hypothesis of @xmath3m - sized @xmath4 ice grains as the reservoir of the missing o atoms .",
    "it is found that the diffuse ism has no difficulty in accommodating @xmath0160@xmath1 of o / h in @xmath3m - sized @xmath4 ice grains , confirming the earlier suggestions made by jenkins ( 2009 ) and poteet et al .",
    "( 2015 ) . with a radius of @xmath04@xmath5 ,",
    "these grains are `` gray '' in the uv / optical and contribute very little to the uv / optical extinction . the 3.1@xmath5 o ",
    "h stretching feature of these grains is significantly suppressed , consistent with the nondetection of this feature in the diffuse ism .",
    "they absorb and scatter effectively in the mid - ir and are capable of accounting for the observed flat extinction at @xmath038@xmath5 .",
    "being relatively transparent in the uv / optical , they do not absorb much and therefore they are cold and mainly emit in the far - ir at @xmath23 , accounting for only @xmath00.34% of the total ir power of the galactic diffuse ism . with a photosputtering lifetime of @xmath94@xmath7@xmath117@xmath118",
    "longer than or comparable to the turnover timescale of molecular clouds of @xmath91@xmath7@xmath92@xmath93 implied by the observed large depletions of si and fe elements in the diffuse ism , @xmath4 ice grains of radii @xmath119 could be present in the diffuse ism through rapid exchange of material between dense molecular clouds where they form and diffuse clouds where they are destroyed by photosputtering .",
