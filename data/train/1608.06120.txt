    "we will call @xmath24 the _ propagator function _ since , as ( [ poissonian ] ) conveys , this entity describes the spatiotemporal propagation of thermal energy .",
    "realistic phonon dispersions @xmath25 and scattering rates @xmath26 usually display directional dependences .",
    "even so , thermal transport in many semiconductors , especially those with cubic / zincblende crystal structures , can be considered isotropic within good approximation @xcite . in the stochastic context",
    ", isotropic motion arises through jump drivers @xmath27 that depend only on the distance between transition sites but not their relative spatial orientation .",
    "we can consequently exploit that a @xmath5-dimensional radially symmetric function @xmath28 has a radially symmetric fourier image @xmath29 obtainable through a univariate integral transform @xcite . in 2d",
    "this property is embodied by the hankel transform @xmath30 with bessel kernel @xmath31 ; the 3d pair @xmath32 involves the spherical bessel kernel @xmath33 .",
    "( explicit formulae are listed in appendix [ app : fouriertransforms ] for convenience . ) owing to these mathematical symmetries , poissonian propagators @xmath24 for multidimensional isotropic transport are always expressable as univariate functions .",
    "these moreover relate rigorously to their 1d counterparts through a straightforward variable exchange @xmath34 ( explicit proof in appendix [ app : mappingproof ] ) .      a variaty of studies @xcite have reconstructed the ` mfp spectrum ' ( cumulative conductivity function ) @xmath2 from effective conductivities @xmath35 measured as a function of a controllable parameter @xmath36 .",
    "although the @xmath37 curve reveals the spatial extent of distinct transport regimes @xcite , it holds insufficient information for computing the actual quasiballistic heat dynamics .",
    "moreover , @xmath37 reconstruction requires solving inverse problems @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is a theoretical ` suppression function ' that depends on the particular details and geometry of the experiment . here",
    ", we instead will perform direct parametric identification of the propagator function @xmath40 , which does constitute a genuine thermal blueprint of the medium per eq .",
    "( [ poissonian ] ) , from raw measurement signals .",
    "this not only bypasses the potential ambiguities associated with effective conductivities but also eliminates the need to determine the suppression function @xmath39 .",
    "a firm connection between the ` macroscopic ' propagator and underlying ` microscopic ' phonon properties is moreover still maintained in the form @xcite @xmath41 subscripts @xmath42 indicate projections on a cartesian axis ( note that all crystal directions are considered equivalent since we operate under isotropic assumptions ) ; the summations over discrete wavevector space can be easily reformulated as integrals over phonon frequency .",
    "the stochastic independence between jump length and wait time in isotropic flight processes induces hopping trajectories with unregulated transition velocities",
    ". this might raise conceptual concerns towards thermal modelling , since phonons propagate at well defined group velocities .",
    "in practice , however , most experimental observations operate within the so called weakly quasiballistic regime @xmath43 in which the green s function @xmath44 of the 1d bte is known to obey an exponential time decay with @xmath45-dependent rate @xcite . from a stochastic viewpoint",
    ", @xmath46 thus conforms precisely to the characteristic signature ( [ poissonian ] ) of a poissonian flight process , as we also pointed out in prior first - principles work @xcite .",
    "after analytic solid angle integrations , the green s function of the 3d bte for an isotropic crystal was additionally found to become formally identical to its 1d counterpart except for variable exchange @xmath47 @xcite . as we saw earlier , isotropic flight processes exhibit precisely the same property through generic mathematical symmetry .",
    "the accuracy and convenience of our framework hinges on utilising physically suitable propagator functions in compact form .",
    "one archetypical process family of particular interest here is that of the alpha - stable ( lvy ) flights .",
    "these are closely associated with fractional - space anomalous diffusion @xcite and defined by @xcite @xmath48 here @xmath3 is the characteristic exponent and @xmath49 ( unit m@xmath50/s ) is the ` fractional diffusivity ' .",

    "lvy flights , therefore , are highly relevant to model quasiballistic thermal transport in semiconductor alloys .",
    "pure lvy processes , however , maintain their hallmark characteristics ( [ levysource ] ) and ( [ levytails ] ) indefinitely because the jump driver @xmath64 has infinite variance .",
    "phonon mfps , by contrast , are always physically bounded through either boundary scattering or macroscopic dissipation effects @xcite .",
    "this restores a finite jump length variance which inherently ensures recovery to brownian motion at long length and time scales @xcite .",

    "mathematically , the instantaneous propagator exponent @xmath70 passes through its midpoint @xmath71 precisely at @xmath72 and achieves 90% of its total swing over the interval @xmath73 .",
    "single crystals typically do not display lvy dynamics because of their smaller scattering exponents @xmath74 . at this pivotal value , power - law dependences for mfp spectra and cross - plane film conductivities",
    "@xmath75 observed for alloys turn into logarithmic ones : @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "first - principles calculations indicate that the reduced propagator @xmath77 in single crystals exhibits a similar logarithmic transition between its diffusive ( @xmath78 ) and quasiballistic ( @xmath79 ) asymptotes .",

    "in earlier work we introduced a ` truncated lvy ' model for quasiballistic tdtr analysis of semiconductor alloys @xcite .",
    "this theory was based on a 1d poissonian flight process that was geometrically extended to 3d heat flow in real space / time domain : @xmath84 this approach suffers from several drawbacks .",
    "first , hindsight revealed that the geometric extension ( [ geoextension ] ) is not exact for non - brownian motion .",
    "pure lvy transport , for example , produces improperly normalised distributions @xmath85 with correct source transient signature @xmath86 but incorrect spatial decay ( tail exponent @xmath87 instead of @xmath88 ) .",
    "these characteristics allowed proper @xmath3 identification but likely compromised @xmath49 extraction .",
    "second , the method is computationally expensive as it required numerical fourier inversion @xmath89 and subsequent hankel - laplace transform @xmath90 .",
    "third , the model was based on previously published jump drivers @xmath91 which resulted in a propagator function @xmath92 with cumbersome functional form .",
    "the framework presented here eliminates these shortcomings .",
    "first , a simple variable change @xmath93 in the propagator function rigorously extends a 1d poissonian process to isotropic multidimensional transport .",
    "second , the ability to operate fully within transformed domains boosts the computational efficiency to the extent that quasiballistic tdtr analysis ( illustrated in sec . [ sec : applications].b ) runs just as fast as conventional diffusive identification .",
    "third , we replaced the bottom - up approach adopted by prior literature by a pragmatic one that describes transitions between asymptotic regimes directly within the propagator function in highly streamlined form .",
    "ttg experiments use interference of two laser beams to subject the sample to a heating pulse that is spatially periodic ( grating period @xmath94 ) in one in - plane direction ( @xmath95 ) @xcite .",
    "the induced power density @xmath96 is assumed to extend uniformly across the other in - plane direction ( @xmath97 ) and decays exponentially in the cross - plane direction ( @xmath98 ) with the optical penetration depth @xmath99 of the pump laser : @xmath100 \\ , \\delta(\\xi_y)}{1 + \\xi_z^2 \\ , d_{\\text{opt}}^2 } \\qquad \\label{ttgsource}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] inverse transform of @xmath101 provides the surface temperature @xmath102 : @xmath103 the measured signal @xmath104 consists of the time decay of the peak - to - valley contrast within @xmath105 .",

    "the presence of the transducer ( and associated thermal resistivity @xmath138 of the metal / semiconductor interface ) as well as the complicated time signature of the heat source render tdtr analysis somewhat more involved than its ttg counterpart .",
