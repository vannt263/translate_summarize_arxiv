    "the born - oppenheimer approximation  @xcite figures prominently in studies of quantum structure and dynamics .",
    "it relies on a scale separation that is controlled by a small parameter gauged by the ratio @xmath0 of the light @xmath1 to heavy @xmath2 masses of different constituents of the system .",
    "this approximation forms the basis for most of electronic structure theory and is also used in adiabatic quantum dynamics where nuclei move on single born - oppenheimer surfaces .",
    "although the born - oppenheimer approximation has wide utility , it does break down and this breakdown signals the fact that quantum nuclear motion can no longer be described as motion on a single electronic state .",
    "nonadiabatic dynamics is important for the description of many excited - state physical processes .",
    "quantum dynamical methods that account for the breakdown of the born - oppenheimer approximation must then be used to follow the time evolution of the system .",
    "@xcite fewest - switches surface hopping  @xcite is one of the most widely used schemes for this purpose .",
    "more generally , the basic elements of the fewest - switches algorithm often enter into molecular dynamics methods that involve quantum transitions .",
    "@xcite    in fewest - switches surface hopping the nuclei are assumed follow stochastic trajectories @xmath3 , with @xmath4 and @xmath5 denoting the @xmath6 nuclear positions and momenta , respectively  @xcite .",
    "trajectory evolution takes place on single adiabatic surfaces with stochastic  hops \" to other surfaces that occur with probabilities that are constructed to lead to the fewest number of hops consistent with the electronic populations .",
    "while this method has known shortcomings it is simple to use and often yields reasonable results .",
    "more specifically , the equations for the electronic density matrix elements governing the dynamics are as follows : the diagonal density matrix elements satisfy @xmath7 while the off - diagonal elements evolve by @xmath8 in this equation @xmath9 is the nonadiabatic coupling matrix element , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , denotes the @xmath12 adiabatic eigenstate . the summation convention was used above and will be used throughout the paper except where summations are written in full for clarity .",
    "transitions between adiabatic states occur probabilistically with a transition rate selected so that the fraction of trajectories in a given adiabatic state corresponds to the electronic population of that state .",
    "energy is conserved along the stochastic trajectories and to ensure that this is the case whenever a nonadiabatic transition causes the system to change its state the nuclear momenta are adjusted to compensate for the energy change in the quantum transition .",
    "for example , if a transition from state @xmath12 to state @xmath13 occurs the momenta of the nuclei along the direction of the nonadiabatic coupling vector are adjusted by @xmath14 , with @xmath15 to conserve energy . here",
    "the energy gap is @xmath16 . for upward transitions it may happen that there is insufficient energy in the nuclear degrees of freedom to insure energy conservation . in this case",
    "the transition rule needs to be modified , usually by setting the transition probability to zero .",
    "this algorithm captures many of the important physical features of nonadiabatic dynamics and is easy to implement in computations , thus justifying its widespread use .",
    "it is not without defects .",
    "since there is no mechanism for the decay of the off - diagonal density matrix elements , it can not describe the effects of decoherence on nonadiabatic processes .",

    "@xcite    the aim of this article is to determine the conditions under which quantum - classical liouville dynamics  @xcite can be reduced to fewest - switches surface hopping .",
    "the quantum - classical liouville equation provides a basis for the derivation of various quantum - classical methods .",

    "the last section of the paper discusses how the results of this study may provide ingredients for the construction of new surface - hopping algorithms .",
    "since surface - hopping methods are often formulated in the adiabatic basis , it is instructive to discuss the dynamical picture that emerges when the quantum - classical liouville equation ( qcle ) is expressed in this basis .",
    "the partially wigner transformed hamiltonian , @xmath17 , for the system can be written as the sum of the nuclear kinetic energy , @xmath18 , and the remainder of the electronic , nuclear and coupling terms contained in the operator @xmath19 : @xmath20 .",

    "the qcle for the density matrix elements , @xmath25 in the adiabatic basis is  @xcite @xmath26 the frequency is @xmath27 and the classical liouville operator @xmath28 is defined by @xmath29 where the hellmann - feynman forces are @xmath30 .",

    "the classical evolution operators @xmath28 describe adiabatic evolution on either single ( @xmath33 ) surfaces or on the mean of two surfaces when @xmath34 .",
    "no approximation is made to obtain such evolution on the mean of two surfaces for off - diagonal elements ; it follows naturally from the representation of the qcle in the adiabatic basis .",
    "the coupling term @xmath35 not only involves nonadiabatic coupling matrix elements , @xmath9 , but also derivatives with respect to the nuclear momenta .",
    "this term accounts for part of the influence of the nonadiabatic quantum electronic dynamics on the nuclei",
    ". this important coupling adds complexity to the equation of motion and its exact treatment precludes a simple description of the nuclear evolution .",
    "one may attempt to solve this equation by any convenient method and considerable effort and schemes have been devised with the aim of obtaining accurate yet computationally tractable solutions .",
    "@xcite since the goal of this paper is to explore connections to fewest - switches surface hopping ( fssh ) , we consider approximate solutions that are based on surface - hopping trajectories .",
    "it is useful to observe that while the qcle conserves energy , nothing is implied about conservation of energy in any single trajectory that might be used in solutions to this equation .",
    "the basis for the surface - hopping solution was described some time ago  @xcite and the details of the algorithms and their applications to various problems have been discussed previously  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is useful to present a brief account of this solution scheme in order to contrast it with fssh in the next section , and to point to some of its features that are often overlooked . in general terms",
    "the surface - hopping method is a stochastic algorithm for the solution of the qcle that relies on monte carlo sampling of diagonal and off - diagonal electronic states and accounts for nuclear momentum changes when transitions occur . in its usual implementation",
    "only one basic approximation is made : the momentum - jump approximation  @xcite .",
    "this approximation , outlined below , replaces the infinitesimal nuclear momentum changes contained in the @xmath35 coupling term by finite momentum changes .",
    "the approximation both makes the dynamics much more tractable computationally and provides a link to other surface - hopping schemes .",
    "for example , if instead of using the momentum - jump approximation momentum derivatives are approximated by finite differences , an exponentially increasing branching tree of trajectories results that quickly makes computation intractable .",
    "@xcite other simulation schemes cited above that are not based on surface hopping do not make the momentum - jump approximation .",
    "the momentum - jump approximation begins by rewriting the operators that appear in @xmath36 as @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "this form shows that the momentum changes can be expressed in terms of an @xmath39-dependent prefactor ( @xmath40 ) multiplying a derivative with respect to the square of the momentum along @xmath41 .",
    "the momentum - jump approximation replaces the factor in parentheses on the right side by an exponential operator with the same leading terms , @xmath42 when the momentum - jump operator @xmath43 acts on any function @xmath44 it yields @xmath45 where @xmath46 apart from a factor of two multiplying @xmath47 , this expression for the momentum adjustment is identical to that in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tully - mom - jump ] ) for the fssh algorithm .",
    "this factor - of - two difference has its origin in the transitions to off - diagonal states ( coherences ) that take place in qcl dynamics .",
    "these results can then be used to write the momentum - jump approximation to @xmath36 : @xmath48 this form will be used henceforth in the surface - hopping solution of the qcle .",
    "the surface - hopping solution proceeds as follows : since the qcl operator commutes with itself the solution of the qcle can be written exactly as @xmath49 where the time interval @xmath50 was divided into @xmath6 segments of lengths @xmath51 and @xmath52 and @xmath53 . if @xmath54 is chosen to be sufficiently small , in each short time segment we may write @xmath55 where the phase factor @xmath56 is defined as @xmath57 and the superscript @xmath58 on @xmath59 indicates that it is propagated classically on the mean of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 surfaces .",
    "the solution for the density matrix then follows from substitution of these short time propagators into eq .",
    "( [ eq : formal ] ) . in principle one just has to carry out the matrix multiplications and actions of the classical evolution and jump operators to find the solution . a better and more computationally tractable way to do",
    "this is to sample the electronic states in the matrix multiplications and the actions of the nonadiabatic transitions by a monte carlo procedure . in the simplest monte carlo scheme",
    "the quantum states are uniformly sampled from the allowed set of states and the actions of the nonadiabatic coupling operators are sampled based on a weight function that reflects the magnitude of the nonadiabatic coupling .",
    "a simple choice to determine if a transition occurs is @xmath60 but other probability factors have been suggested  @xcite .",
    "if no transition occurs , then a weight @xmath61 is included to account for this failure .",
    "if a transition does occur , a weight @xmath62 is applied and the nuclear momenta are adjusted by the momentum - jump operator so that energy is conserved .",
    "note that because of the use of the momentum - jump approximation it may happen that nuclear degrees of freedom do not have sufficient energy for this process to take place .",
    "then the argument of the square root in the expression for @xmath63 will be negative and the expression can not be used . in this circumstance the transition is not allowed and the evolution continues on the current adiabatic surface .    from this description",
    "one sees that the surface - hopping trajectories are a consequence of the momentum - jump approximation and the monte carlo sampling method used to construct the solution .",
    "the scheme does not make any anzatz on the nature of the stochastic trajectories that underlie the dynamics nor is any special physical significance attached to the probabilities with which the stochastic hops are carried out .",
    "figure  [ fig : qcle - traj ] shows an example of some of the trajectories that contribute to the diagonal ( @xmath64 ) density matrix element at phase point @xmath65 at time @xmath50 .",
    "stochastic trajectories that contribute to the diagonal density matrix @xmath66 .",
    "the density is computed at a fixed phase space point @xmath65 in this eulerian representation .",
    "the different trajectories indicate possible sequences of transitions that may occur .",
    "in this short set of segments a variety of density matrix elements at different phase points all contribute to the @xmath64 density at phase point @xmath65 at time @xmath50 .",
    "the solid lines denote propagation on single adiabatic surfaces while the dashed lines signify propagation on the mean of two adiabatic surfaces ; a phase factor is attached to these segments .",
    "the vertical dotted lines indicate nonadiabatic surface - hopping transitions accompanied by momentum shifts . in the stochastic algorithm described in the text each trajectory also carries a monte carlo weight . ]    in practice computations of populations or coherences are carried out somewhat differently by making use of the expression for the average value of an operator , @xmath67 , given in the adiabatic basis by @xmath68 the second line of this equation expresses the expectation value in a computationally more convenient form that involves sampling over the initial density matrix .",
    "the time evolution of the operator also satisfies a qcle but with forward time propagation .",
    "@xcite for example , to compute the population in state @xmath69 , @xmath70 , select @xmath71 so that @xmath72    from this expression one can see that the time evolved operator will contain all of the reweighting factors needed to obtain the correct population from the average over the ensemble of stochastic trajectories .",
    "the population is not obtained by simply determining the fraction of trajectories in state @xmath69 at time @xmath50 .",
    "instead , each trajectory carries a set of weights that give the correct weighting of that trajectory to its contribution in the ensemble . in this way all the correlations in the ensemble are taken into account .",
    "this feature is both its most important attribute and the source of its primary difficulty : monte carlo weights can accumulate over long trajectories leading to instabilities requiring increasing numbers of trajectories to obtain converged results .",
    "the difficulties can partially eliminated by filtering , and filtering methods have been suggested and used in calculations .",
    "@xcite the method has been shown to give accurate solutions , although the number of trajectories required to obtain the results is considerably larger than for fssh .",
    "fewest - switches surface hopping assumes that between nonadiabatic hops the nuclear degrees of freedom evolve classically on single adiabatic surfaces governed by hellmann - feynman forces .",

    "it appears in both the equations for the off - diagonal ( @xmath34 ) and diagonal ( @xmath33 with @xmath80 ) density matrix elements .",
    "note also that if @xmath81 the decoherence factor takes the simpler form , @xmath82 this decoherence factor appeared earlier in a study of surface hopping in the context of the qcle by subotnik , ouyang and landry  @xcite . while formally exact it",
    "is not easily computed but its approximate evaluation has been discussed in this paper .",
    "it can form the basis for approximate methods for incorporating decoherence effects in simple surface - hopping schemes .",
    "writing these equations more explicitly , the equation of motion for the diagonal element of the density matrix for state @xmath69 is , @xmath83 while the equation for the off - diagonal elements is @xmath84    these equations are equivalent to the original qcle ( with the momentum - jump approximation ) , but simply viewed in a different frame .",
    "the decoherence term has the form of a classical operator that acts on the nuclear momenta and depends on the difference between two hellmann - feynman forces corresponding to two different adiabatic surfaces . as discussed earlier , coherence is created in the qcle by transition events that take the system to off - diagonal density matrix elements , and coherence is destroyed when the system returns to a diagonal population state .",
    "the decoherence factors that appear in the above equations are another representation of these processes .      in fssh",
    "the classical dynamics follows stochastic trajectories comprising evolution on single adiabatic surfaces interrupted by transitions to other adiabatic surfaces .",
    "these transitions are accompanied by momentum adjustments to conserve energy .",
    "there are no transitions to off - diagonal density matrix elements .",
    "consequently , to make connection to fssh , nonadiabatic transitions must be restricted to those events that connect diagonal density matrix elements .",

    "their derivation led to several ingredients that both justified some of the assumptions in fssh and revealed some of its deficiencies .",

    "the main decoherence factors they needed to append to the equations of motion are the same as those that enter in the treatment in this paper .",
    "in addition they showed how these decoherence factors could be approximated to yield tractable forms and how they are related to earlier suggestions for the treatment of decoherence .",
    "the problem was approached from the opposite perspective in this study : the starting point was the qcle and its solution by a surface - hopping algorithm .",
    "the qcle was then transformed to a lagrangian frame that moved with the dynamics on a specific adiabatic surface , and in this frame one could see what parts of the evolution operator needed to be modified to obtain fssh .",
    "the resulting analysis does not constitute a derivation of fssh since the result is obtained by discarding and approximating portions of the qcl operator , but it does provide considerable insight into the features that distinguish the quantum - classical liouville and fewest - switches surface - hopping algorithms",
    ".    several observations can be gleaned from the analysis presented in this paper .",
    "it is well known that the lack of a proper treatment of decoherence is one of the major shortcomings of fssh and , as described in the text , various suggestion for how to incorporate decoherence in the surface - hopping framework have been proposed .",
    "decoherence is taken into account in qcl dynamics and we have seen that the decoherence factor takes a suggestive form when this dynamics is viewed in a frame of reference that moves with the dynamics on a single active @xmath69 adiabatic surface . in the qcl dynamics",
    "the decoherence effects arise from transitions to and from the coherent evolution segments where the nuclear propagation occurs on the mean of two adiabatic surfaces and carries a phase .",
    "while the construction of decoherence factors in surface - hopping schemes often involves approximations whose validity is not fully determined , it is , in fact , very easy to simulate the evolution on the mean of two surfaces that describe the coherent ( off - diagonal ) evolution segments of the dynamics .",
    "so , to account for decoherence in surface hopping , rather than forcing the dynamics to evolve on single adiabatic surfaces , it is likely to be better to allow the system to jump to and propagate on both population and off - diagonal states .",
    "as discussed earlier , this is the case for the qcl surface - hopping scheme where the evolution segments involve both diagonal and off - diagonal dynamics with transitions between them .",
    "this is also the case for a recently - proposed surface - hopping scheme in liouville space  @xcite .",
    "that scheme incorporates transitions from diagonal to off - diagonal coherent evolution segments as in the surface - hopping solution of the qcle , but the transition rates are approximated by forms analogous to those in fssh .",
    "no reweighting is carried out and a prescription is given to obtain populations from the ensemble of trajectories .",
    "surface - hopping methods have considerable appeal when considering nonadiabatic dynamics since they provide a conceptually appealing way to view the dynamics .",
    "however , when one attempts to probe more deeply into their basis , the usual complexity of quantum mechanics , or even mixed quantum - classical mechanics , comes into play .",
    "the trajectories that comprise the ensemble that is used to compute observables are not independent and schemes must be devised to account for the correlations .",
    "this feature is manifest in the weights that the trajectories carry in the surface - hopping solution of the qcle , as well as in other representation of this equation  @xcite , and in a recent coherent state hopping method for nonadiabatic dynamics  @xcite .",
    "other research in this area has as its goal placing surface hopping on a more rigorous mathematical foundation .",

    "<S> fewest - switches surface hopping is studied in the context of quantum - classical liouville dynamics . both approaches are mixed quantum - classical theories that provide a way to describe and simulate the nonadiabatic quantum dynamics of many - body systems . starting from a surface - hopping solution of the quantum - classical liouville equation , it is shown how fewest - switches dynamics can be obtained by dropping terms that are responsible for decoherence and restricting the nuclear momentum changes that accompany electronic transitions to those events that occur between population states . </S>",
