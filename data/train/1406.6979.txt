    "often the internal dissipation in soft matter systems is sufficiently large so that their dynamics can be considered as overdamped .",
    "for instance the motion of dispersed colloidal particles is dominated by the friction with the surrounding liquid @xcite .",
    "another example is the dynamics of polymer chains in melt or solution , described in a first approach by the famous rouse and zimm models @xcite .",
    "apart from that , in polymeric systems the dynamic behavior is often dominated by relaxation processes . the reason is found in the large size of their building blocks .",

    "magnetic colloidal particles are embedded into a crosslinked polymeric matrix .",
    "qualitatively different kinds of this `` embedding '' can be achieved by different protocols of synthesis . on the one hand , the magnetic particles",
    "can simply be enclosed in mesh pockets of the polymer network @xcite .",
    "this allows a certain degree of freedom for particle reorientations . on the other hand , via surface functionalization , the magnetic particles can serve as crosslinkers and thus become part of the polymer mesh @xcite .",
    "then , restoring torques hinder reorientations of the particles .",
    "we use the term `` orientational memory '' to refer to this situation @xcite .    from the internal architecture of these materials",
    "it is obvious that their magnetic and mechanical properties are strongly coupled to each other .",

    "for example , the mechanical properties , such as the mechanical elastic modulus , can be tuned and adjusted reversibly from outside by applying external magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "this may be exploited in constructing novel damping devices @xcite and vibrational absorbers @xcite .",
    "several theoretical studies have shown that the internal spatial particle distribution plays a qualitative role for this effect @xcite .    furthermore ,",
    "applying time - dependent external magnetic fields can induce deformations , which makes the materials candidates for the use as soft actuators @xcite .",
    "related to this feature , it has been demonstrated theoretically that the spatial particle arrangement in the materials has a qualitative impact on the magnetostrictive behavior @xcite .",
    "apart from that , quick remagnetizations of the magnetic particles by an alternating external magnetic field can lead to local heating .",
    "the effect is due to hysteretic losses in the dynamic magnetization processes . it can be used for hyperthermal cancer treatment @xcite .    in all these processes ,",
    "dynamic modes of the materials are excited .",
    "this happens via the time - dependence of the applied mechanical deformations and external magnetic fields .",
    "different modes will dominate depending on the type of external stimulus . in the described situation",
    "there are two major differences when compared to the classical picture of phonon modes in conventional solids @xcite : we expect the dynamics of the magnetic particles to be mainly of the relaxatory kind , and the particle arrangement is not that of a regular crystalline lattice .    a natural goal is to optimize the materials in view of their applications . for this purpose , it is important to understand if and how the dynamic modes are determined by internal structural properties and by external magnetic fields .",
    "our ambition in this paper is to qualitatively demonstrate that the relaxation dynamics can be influenced by three different factors : orientational memory , spatial distribution of the magnetic particles , and external magnetic fields . for this purpose",
