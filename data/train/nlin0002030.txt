    "there is a great deal of experimental and theoretical interest in long - range , low - frequency acoustic pulse propagation through the deep ocean s sound channel .",
    "it has been investigated as a problem of wave propagation in random media ( wprm )  @xcite , and as a basis for tomography  @xcite .",

    "one of the main challenges in analyzing and understanding long range acoustic propagation is in dealing with difficulties arising from the ocean environment s tendency to generate multiple , weak , small - angle ( forward ) scattering  @xcite . at sufficiently long ranges of propagation",
    ", the multiple scattering should effectively randomize an acoustic pulse so that it is very difficult to deduce much information .",
    "however , several long range experiments have found a great deal of stability in the earlier portions of the received wave fronts in spite of the fluctuations inherent in the ocean environment  @xcite .",
    "in addition , it has been found that wave field intensity fluctuations at long range are consistent with a lognormal density  @xcite which would be reminiscent of earlier work in optics on wprm  @xcite , except that this earlier work was for the short range ( weak focusing ) regime .    in the past 10 - 15 years",
    ", simplified models inspired by the ocean environment have been shown to possess chaotic ray limits  @xcite .",
    "essentially simultaneously , there has been enormous progress in the understanding of chaotic systems  @xcite .",
    "some of the most familiar emerging concepts are simpler for bounded systems and are not easily applicable to open , scattering systems as we have here .",
    "however , there is an important tool which does straightforwardly generalize for our purposes , the stability analysis of the rays .",
    "stability matrices can be constructed as a function of range for each ray .",
    "their properties , such as the stability exponents , reveal the basic character of the rays , and are at the foundation of the findings reported in this paper .",
    "there are several intriguing questions that arise from comparing the theoretical results to date regarding chaotic acoustic ray dynamics in the ocean and the high amount of stability observed in the data .",
    "the most general question concerns how an acoustic pulse  which at multi - megameter ranges extends to nearly 10 seconds in time and 2 km in depth  loses it s coherence from multiple forward scattering through interaction with internal waves and mesoscale energetics .",
    "because refraction is adequate to explain the scattering physics  @xcite , the ray limit should suffice for understanding long - range propagation .",
    "some manifestations of the underlying chaotic dynamics should be observed .",
    "it has been suggested that there exists a `` predictability horizon '' at the range of propagation defined by the scale over which chaotic dynamics develops  @xcite . beyond this range",
    ", the wave fields should appear as random superpositions of many plane waves  @xcite which would imply that acoustic field intensity fluctuations are rayleigh distributed  @xcite .",
    "several problems crop up beyond the predictability horizon .",
    "it becomes increasingly difficult to get numerically calculated rays to converge to true rays of the system .",
    "worse , semiclassical approximations ( i.e.  wave front reconstructions ) from the rays might fail for fundamental reasons related to the breakdown of stationary phase approximations , but one should recognize that more optimistic viewpoints exist on this issue  @xcite .",
    "whether or not this is true , it is currently not known to what extent tomographic inversions fail for any system beyond its predictability horizon where eigenrays are proliferating exponentially fast with increasing range . in order to begin addressing these and related issues , we focus on the ` forward propagation problem ' by performing a statistical analysis that should be much less sensitive to the difficulties engendered by the predictability horizon .",
    "in fact , justifications for statistical laws derived by invoking stochastic or ergodic postulates are often ultimately founded on the presence of fully developed chaos ; see for example ref .",
    "systems that once were approached by stochastic methods have more recently begun to be regarded from the perspective of dynamical systems .",
    "the two approaches mostly give consistent results , but there are important distinctions .",
    "stochastic ray modeling is the traditional approach to the geometric limit of the problem of wprm  @xcite .",
    "this nondeterministic treatment leads one to pessimistic conclusions regarding the overall stability expected in an ocean acoustic pulse at sufficiently long range  @xcite . by carefully defining the lyapunov exponent , it turns out to be roughly half the value reported in ref .",
    "the scales relevant to the ocean are such that this factor two increase in an important length scale might prove to be significant .",
    "also , for this problem , the validity of the stochastic or ergodic assumptions deserves to be critically examined .",
    "it is not obvious that a dynamical systems perspective would lead to similar pessimistic conclusions as does the stochastic ray theory .",
    "for example , the predictability horizon concept that has grown out of the chaotic dynamics point of view does not necessarily lead to a sudden transition  regular behavior at short ranges , completely stochastic just beyond  and remnants of stability that violate assumptions of stochasticity could persist well into the horizon s initial onset .",
    "we anticipate several features of deterministic dynamics playing an interconnected role in this regard , but we focus on the importance of only one , _ intermittent - like dynamics_. intermittency is a common feature for nonintegrable dynamical systems  @xcite . for the ray acoustics problem ,",
    "intermittent - like behavior is evident through the appearance of rays which persist in remaining relatively insensitive to their initial conditions ( also environment ) for remarkably long ranges , as measured on the inverse scale of the mean lyapunov exponent .",
    "it might then be expected that the existence of intermittent - like dynamics might allow linear based tomographic inversions based on acoustic ray models to be suitable to greater ranges than previously anticipated .",
    "one objective of this article is to illustrate the existence of intermittent - like dynamics in the generic long - range ocean acoustics problem .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the wide variability in the eigenvalues of the stability matrix which is defined in sect .",
    "we demonstrate that the magnitude of its largest eigenvalue follows a lognormal distribution , and that the stability exponent follows a gaussian distribution .",
    "importantly , there is preliminary evidence suggesting that these distributions are robust , i.e.  that they would be found in much more realistic , sophisticated ocean models  @xcite . to be more explicit , if one knows the probability density of the stability exponents , then one can determine the expected measure of intermittent - like rays that will persist out to the reception range .",
    "it follows that these rays will not require extremely precise numerical interpolation schemes for quantities such as the gradient of the potential .",
    "the model upon which we rely in this paper is admittedly extremely simplified .",
    "however , it is not the model that is of concern , it is whether or not general features of simplified wprm models carry over to the ocean itself .",
    "if we are careful enough , the simplifications that we accept remove non - essential complications for uncovering the general physical features of interest , and no more . a follow - up study to",
    "this one is underway which uses a more realistic ocean sound speed model .",
    "it is important for confirming the applicability of our results to long - range ocean acoustics experiments .",
    "the organization is as follows : in sect .",
    "[ model ] , we introduce and motivate a simple model leading to a one - degree - of - freedom , non - autonomous hamiltonian dynamical system for the rays .",
    "this is followed by a discussion of the analysis methods which are most critical for our study .",
    "they are based on the stability matrix and its well known properties .",
    "[ fluc ] examines the fluctuation behavior of the stability exponents giving their densities as a function of range .",
    "the proportion of intermittent - like rays is deduced and compared with the numerical results of the model .",
    "we finish with a discussion and conclusions .",
    "we briefly outline the assumptions and approximations leading to the highly idealized ray model used in this paper .",
    "the primary physics we are concerned about involve refraction of acoustic energy due to volume inhomogeneities in the ocean sound speed .",
    "we assume that interactions of the acoustic energy with both the surface and sub - bottom are negligible . for multi - megameter ranges of propagation in mid - latitude , deep ocean environments , a significant amount of acoustic energy",
    "is received that satisfies this assumption @xcite . as alluded to above , the necessary assumptions leading to the primary results are that : i ) the linear , one - way helmholtz wave equation is valid ( the important point here is that backscattering is negligible ) , and ii ) the spatial scales of the sound speed field are long compared to the acoustic wavelength so that ray theory is justified .",
    "a detailed derivation is readily available @xcite .",
    "we point out _ a priori _ that the coordinate system is three - dimensional cartesian @xmath0 , with @xmath1 the range from the source , @xmath2 the transverse or cross - range coordinate , and @xmath3 the depth from the surface .",
    "thus , earth curvature effects are neglected .",
    "the fundamental starting point is the linear acoustic wave equation @xcite : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the complex scalar wave function whose real part denotes the acoustic pressure .",
    "the sound speed field @xmath6 can be taken as a function of space @xmath7 only whereby it has been assumed that the time scales for the propagation of the acoustic wave function are small compared to the time scale associated with the evolution of the sound speed field . for non - dispersive sources , the acoustic group and phase speeds are equivalent , and one can linearly transform eq .",
    "( [ wave ] ) from time to frequency , arriving at a helmholtz equation with the magnitude of the wave vector defined as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the continuous wave ( cw ) source frequency .",
    "attenuation effects can of course be incorporated by modifying @xmath10 to be a complex quantity , but since we are interested in : 1 ) acoustic energy that interacts negligibly with the ocean bottom , and 2 ) typical sources operating at frequencies with minimal volume attenuation ( with center frequencies of about 100 hz@xcite ) , ignoring attenuation effects seems reasonable .",
    "also , one can similarly derive a reduced wave equation which includes variations in density , but we ignore this effect because it is known to be important predominantly with acoustic energy that interacts with the ocean sub - bottom , which is not considered herein .    the next assumption ( which is quite a reasonable one ) is that the strength of the sound speed fluctuations , whatever the physical process that produces them , are small .",
    "this allows one to neglect backscattered acoustic energy , and admits the one - way helmholtz wave equation , whereby one assumes a primary direction of propagation along the range .",
    "the so - called `` standard parabolic approximation '' is invoked next .",
    "this allows one to derive a linear partial differential wave equation of parabolic type for the complex envelope of @xmath11 .",
    "the principle assumption is that this envelope wave function evolves slowly on the scale of the acoustic wavelength .",
    "there many _ flavors _ of parabolic approximations that have varying degrees of phase errors in the complex wave function @xmath11 as compared to the one - way helmholtz equation @xcite , but we choose to use the standard parabolic approximation , which takes the form @xmath12 where the transverse laplacian is represented by @xmath13 , and the variable @xmath1 is the range ( propagation variable ) , but plays an exact analogous role to time in the schrdinger equation of quantum mechanics .",
    "the parameter @xmath14 represents the reference wave number , and depends on the choice of a reference sound speed @xmath15 , which we take to be 1.5 km / s .",
    "the potential , @xmath16 , is related to the sound speed fluctuations as @xmath17   \\sim { \\delta c(y , z;r)\\over c_0}\\ ; , \\ ] ] where the sound speed variations away from an average profile has been expressed as @xmath18 .",
    "the sound speed fluctuations refract the rays and lead to chaos in a deterministic , mathematically defined sense . under the parabolic approximation , the basic problem maps precisely onto problems of quantum chaos  @xcite .",
    "the fields of long range acoustic propagation in the ocean and quantum chaos thus have the opportunity of cross - fertilization .",
    "because the instability does not critically depend on having multiple degrees of freedom , we make a significant , practical simplification in the model of ignoring the depth degree of freedom ( @xmath3 ) ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for a more detailed discussion of the model presented here .",
    "the system could be thought of as lying in the plane of the sound channel axis , but this is really just the generic problem of wprm ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the gain in simplicity more than compensates for the loss of realism at this point as long as the main physical phenomena carry over to more realistic models .",
    "as was mentioned in the introduction , preliminary evidence for our main results have been found in recent calculations incorporating a much more realistic model  @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the wave vector @xmath10 is large enough that for the purposes of this study , we can focus on the ray limit .",
    "the rays can be generated by a system of hamilton s equations @xmath19 where @xmath2 and @xmath20 are the phase space variables cross - range ( position ) and horizontal slowness ( momentum ) respectively .",
    "the independent variable @xmath1 denotes range .",

    "( [ schro ] ) necessitates that the hamiltonian is explicitly @xmath21 the physical meaning of momentum is @xmath22 , where @xmath23 represents the angle a ray subtends in cross - range about the range axis .",
    "the state of the ocean is constantly changing , and its exact state is unknown .",
    "a statistical ansatz is thus fruitful for making assertions concerning its `` typical '' state .",
    "assuming isotropy in the sound speed fluctuations in range and cross - range , the potential is taken to be a realization of a zero - mean , stationary , random function .",
    "thus a single correlation length scale @xmath24 exists .",
    "the standard deviation is denoted by @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the root - mean - square fluctuation of the sound speed about @xmath15 .",

    "one should envision the potential as being deterministic , even though it is selected from an ensemble of realizations .",
    "this implies that the potential is to be considered a highly complicated ( albeit smooth and fixed ) function of both @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "to provide some idea of the character of this potential , contours of sound speed fluctuations based on a typical region of @xmath34 is shown contoured in fig .",

    "the proportion of intermittent - like rays decreases exponentially as @xmath153 where @xmath154 and @xmath155 can be deduced from the asymptotic properties of the error function , and this behavior is independent of the precise criterium used for the maximum desired @xmath56 . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ intermit ] , @xmath156 of the initial ray density remains stable or nearly stable out to ranges of order @xmath157 .",
    "this @xmath156 of the initial acoustic energy is then only linearly sensitive to the fluctuating sound speed field , and since energy remains in coherent bundles ( see fig .",
    "[ rays ] ) , they will be expected to have a longer time coherence over repeated experiments as the environment evolves .",
    "performing repeated experiments and applying coherent averaging as a filter to pick up this energy , one can imagine being able to use this apportionment of the initial acoustic pulse for acoustic tomography .",
    "long - range , low - frequency sound propagation in the ocean has been previously investigated both as a problem of wave propagation through a random medium , and as a basis for tomography .",
    "several outstanding quandaries remain that our results only begin to address : i ) in the early arriving portion of a wave front , there seems to be more coherence and stability than would be expected from an analysis based on stochastic ray techniques common to the subject of wprm ; ii ) one expects that as one moves from the weak focusing to strong focusing regimes ( roughly speaking , from short range to long range ) , there should be a transition from lognormally distributed wave field intensities to rayleigh distributed ones .",
    "data analyses suggest that the lognormal densities extend well beyond the weak focusing regime , and the cross - over is not understood theoretically ; and iii ) related to the first item , given the presence of more stability than seems consistent with theoretical modeling , how valid are the underlying assumptions of tomographic inversions performed at long ranges ?",
    "complete solutions to these problems are well beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that our results form one cornerstone for their eventual resolution . as the ocean acoustic problem mainly involves refraction , and is in a wavelength regime that should be extremely well - suited to semiclassical analysis , we have focused our attention exclusively on a simple ray model inspired by the ocean .",
    "our approach is from a dynamical systems perspective as opposed to a stochastic ray method .",
    "it has the advantage of being a more fundamental starting point in the sense that a system s dynamics may determine where a stochastic ray method is appropriate , but a stochastic ray method just presupposes a certain randomness that may or may not actually exist in the system s dynamics .",
    "our main concern is the ray stability properties that govern wave field amplitudes in semiclassical approximations .",
    "a follow - up study is underway to address the phases ( classical actions and geometric indices ) , correlations amongst ray properties , and robustness , i.e.  the generality and applicability to the ocean of our results .",
    "the stability matrix is our key analysis tool because it contains all the necessary information about how stable or unstable each ray is .",
    "the distribution of stabilities reflects on statistical properties arising in the study of wprm whereas the existence or lack thereof of stable rays impacts tomographic inversion .",
    "we also note that studying the stability matrix has the utility of providing additional strong checks on one s numerical integration techniques",
    ". its determinant must remain unity .",
    "we have carefully introduced several stability exponents depending upon whether ensemble averaging is taken before or after the logarithm ( or at all ) , and whether the range is finite or the infinite range limit is taken .",
    "we have related them to the absolute value of the trace of the stability matrix which we have found to fluctuate to a high degree of consistency with a lognormal density ; note that this also applies to the absolute value of individual matrix elements of the stability matrix .",
    "we have given a heuristic argument for this distribution , and are not aware of any known analytic derivations of this result .",
    "an important consequence follows from the appearance of lognormally distributed stabilities , or equivalently gaussian densities in the stability exponents ( the logarithmic variables ) . as shown in sect .",
    "[ fluc ] [ see eq .",
    "( [ rhotrm ] ) ] , any power of the stability matrix trace , or individual matrix elements , is also distributed lognormally .",
    "thus , each individual contribution of an eigenray to the semiclassical approximation of the green s function has a magnitude fluctuating as a lognormal density .",
    "further study is underway to determine theoretically the cross - over from lognormal wave field intensity distributions characteristic of the weak focusing limit to rayleigh densities in the strong focusing limit .",
    "it is tempting to extrapolate our results to compute statistically relevant quantities such as the scintillation index ( normalized variance of intensity ) by using eq .",
    "( [ momenttrm ] ) .",
    "although one can immediately deduce that the normalized variance of intensity due to a single ray contribution grows exponentially with range with a e - folding scale of ( @xmath158 ) , one can not infer anything about the scintillation index in the region where multipathing is important since the phase of each contributing ray must be incorporated into the calculation .",
    "also , our work assumes one is at or beyond the regime of strong focusing .",
    "this is confirmed in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ nunu ] , where @xmath79 is seen to converge at the range @xmath159 . since the strong markov assumption is valid for this problem , this range can be shown to be of the order where strong focusing occurs .",
    "thus it is erroneous to compute the scintillation index from our work in the weak focusing regime ( @xmath160 ) where only one ray contributes to the intensity distribution .",
    "all rays in the model possess identical lyapunov exponents , and the finite - range , mean stability exponent , @xmath79 , converges rapidly to it ( see upper panel of fig .",
    "[ nunu ] ) .",
    "this follows from the finite range stability exponent acting as a gaussian random variable with a standard deviation shrinking with range as @xmath128 .",
    "this is also a consequence of the lognormal density , and not the single scale nature of the sound speed fluctuations per se .",
    "this behavior may be rather general ( as general as the lognormal behavior ) , and it would be interesting to verify it in more realistic models .",
    "it is quite unlike the @xmath161-scaling law for the stability exponents which should only apply to a model with a single correlation scale in range for the sound speed fluctuations .",
    "the lognormal distribution has very broad tails .",
    "one typically observes stability matrix traces that fluctuate many orders of magnitude at a given range .",
    "long after the appearance of highly unstable rays as a function of range , some stable or nearly stable rays will still be present .",
    "their proportion decays essentially exponentially with range where the parameters are uniquely fixed by the lyapunov exponent and the related stability exponent @xmath76 .",
    "however , they may be tomographically invertible , and relatively speaking , more important than their proportion would suggest .",
    "we have pointed out the distinctiveness of their behavior relative to unstable rays such as the way they twist about each other , and hang together as they propagate .",
    "their collective properties appear to be highly correlated .",
    "the @xmath128 behavior of the standard deviation of the stability exponent leads to a paradoxical situation in which all the rays possess a unique lyapunov exponent , yet the exponentiated quantity , the matrix elements or trace of the stability matrix possess a divergent variance as the range approaches infinity .",
    "this illustrates dramatically the differences arising when non - commuting operations , i.e.  ensemble averaging , taking the logarithm , and taking the infinite range limit , are interchanged .",
    "it is the stability matrix elements which are relevant to semiclassical approximations .",
    "so the individual terms in a summation over eigenrays will vary infinitely in their relative importance . + * acknowledgments *        j.  a.  colosi , a.  b.  baggeroer , t.  g.  birdsall , c.  clark , b.  d.  cornuelle , d.  costa , b.  d.  dushaw , m.  dzieciuch , a.  m.  g.  forbes , b.  m.  howe , d.  menemenlis , j.  a.  mercer , k.  metzger , w.  munk , r.  c.  spindel , p.  f.  worcester , and c.  wunsch , `` a review of recent results on ocean acoustic wave propagation in random media : basin scales , '' ieee journ .  of ocean .",
