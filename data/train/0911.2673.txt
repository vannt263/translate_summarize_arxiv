    "intense uv radiation from massive stars is one of the main mechanisms responsible for the heating of the interestelar medium in the nuclear region of starburst galaxies .",
    "this mechanism is particularly important in the latest stages of starburst ( sb ) galaxies where the newly formed massive star clusters are responsible for creating large photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) .",
    "this is the case for the prototypical sb galaxy m82 , where the large observed abundances of molecular species such as hco , hoc@xmath0 , co@xmath0 , and h@xmath2o@xmath0 are claimed to be probes of the high ionization rates in large pdrs formed as a consequence of its extended evolved nuclear starburst @xcite .",
    "observational evidences point to a significant enhancement in the abundance of hoc@xmath0 in regions with large ionization fractions .",
    "the abundance ratio [ hco@xmath0]/[hoc@xmath0]@xmath4 is found in the prototypical galactic pdrs of the orion bar @xcite . similar or even lower abundance ratios are observed in the pdrs ngc7023 ( 50 - 120 , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , as well as in diffuse clouds ( 70 - 120 , * ? ? ?",
    "this is in contrast with the much larger ratios of @xmath5 found in dense molecular clouds well shielded from the uv radiation .",
    "however , these low hco@xmath0/hoc@xmath0 ratios are not found in other galactic pdrs .",
    "large values of this ratio of @xmath6 are found in the pdrs m17-sw , s140 , and ngc2023 @xcite .",
    "the hco molecule has also been observed to be a particularly good tracer of the pdr interfaces .",
    "low ratios of [ hco@xmath0]/[hco]@xmath7 are found in prototypical galactic pdrs @xcite . the large hco abundance ( @xmath8 ) altogether with the low ratio [ hco@xmath0]/[hco]@xmath9 in the horsehead pdr is claimed to be a diagnostic for an ongoing fuv - dominated photochemistry @xcite .",
    "co@xmath0 is also claimed to be particularly prominent in the chemical modeling of pdrs and high abundances of this molecule appear to be correlated to similar enhancements of hoc@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "[ co@xmath0]/[hoc@xmath0 ] ratios in the range of 1 - 10 are observed in a number of pdrs @xcite , but only of @xmath10 towards the horsehead pdr @xcite .    as mentioned above ,",
    "this set of pdr probes has been extensively studied towards m82 .",
    "however , no such complete studies have been carried out towards other prototypical galaxies , but for the detection of hco and hoc@xmath0 towards ngc1068 @xcite and h@xmath2o@xmath0 in arp220 @xcite .",
    "m82 and ngc253 are the brightest prototypes of nearby sb galaxies , at a similar distance and showing very similar ir luminosities and star formation rates of about @xmath11 @xcite.however , both galaxies show very different chemical composition .",
    "the chemistry and to a large extend the heating in the central region of ngc253 is believed to be dominated by large scale low velocity shocks @xcite .",
    "the similar chemical composition found in the nuclear region of ngc253 to that in galactic star forming molecular complexes points to an earlier evolutionary stage of the starburst in this galaxy than that in m82 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , our recent observations of the pdr component as traced by the easily photodissociated hnco molecule towards a sample of galaxies @xcite showed the non - detection of hnco in m82 , at a very low abundance limit .",
    "this low hnco abundance supports the scenario that the pdr chemistry dominates the molecular composition of the ism in this galaxy .",
    "however , from the hnco measured abundance in ngc253 , it would be placed in an intermediate stage of evolution where photodissociation should be starting to play a significant role in driving a uv - dominated chemistry which has not been yet identified towards this galaxy .",
    "the presence of a significant pdr component in ngc253 claimed from the hnco abundance is also inferred from the similar intensity of the atomic fine structure line intensities from pdr tracers like cii and oi @xcite observed in both m82 and ngc253 .",
    "in this paper we present the first detection of pdr molecular tracers hoc@xmath0 and co@xmath0 , and confirm the detection hco ( tentatively detected by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the central region of ngc253 which allows the evaluation of the influence of the photodissociation radiation in the nuclear ism of this sb galaxy .",
    "the results presented here support the scenario of the presence of a significant pdr component and clearly show the potential of molecular complexity in estimating the contribution of the different heating mechanisms of the ism in the nuclei of galaxies .",

    "although pointing accuracy was of the order of @xmath26 , the different shapes observed between the hco@xmath0 and hoc@xmath0 is attributed to a small change in the pointing position during the two observations .",
    "this effect accounts for an uncertainty in the integrated intensity of @xmath27 .",
    "even though the hco@xmath0 feature was not completely covered by the backend , the integrated intensity we derive is in agreement within @xmath28 with that of theobserved by @xcite and we observe the line shape to be consistent with that of @xmath14 .",

    "the double gaussian profiles fitted to each species were constrained to have similar linewidths .",

    "this shows that the fainter hco hyperfine transitions may account for up to a @xmath39 of the h@xmath1co@xmath0 integrated intensity .",
    "jcmt observations were performed in beam switched mode with a frequency of 1hz and beam throw of @xmath40 in azimuth .",
    "the acsis digital autocorrelator spectrometer was used with a bandwidth of 1600mhz providing a resolution of @xmath9mhz .",

    "is observed from one of the velocity components at this position , which is due to the jcmt observed position being @xmath44 and @xmath45 away from those observed with the iram 30 m , respectively .",
    "this position is half beam away from the positions observed with the iram30 m , so the abundance ratios derived from this observation might be affected by a larger uncertainty of up to a factor of 2 .",

    "however , we observe its profile significantly blended to that of the group of transitions of @xmath49 .",
    "this overlap was not a problem in the case of the co@xmath0 detection towards m82 due to the significantly lower abundance of ch@xmath2oh towards this galaxy @xcite .",

    "we discuss the detection of @xmath1ch@xmath2oh in the context of the derived abundances with respect to those of the main methanol isotopologue .",
    "we have estimated the fractional abundances of the newly observed species in ngc253 assuming optically thin emission , lte conditions , and similar spatial distribution for all species . under these assumptions",

    "the @xmath52k is assumed based on the average rotational temperatures derived from most of the species detected towards ngc253 @xcite .",
    "indeed the non detection of hoc@xmath53 implies low excitation temperatures of @xmath54k .",
    "both the excitation temperature and the emission extent have an important impact in the absolute derived column densities by up to a factor of 2 , however , the fractional abundances and abundance ratios are mostly independent of these assumptions .",

    "indeed , if the @xmath59c/@xmath1c ratio of @xmath60 derived for ngc253 and ngc4945 @xcite applies to all these galaxies , an average opacity of @xmath61 is derived from the @xmath62 line ratio ( this work and * ? ? ?",
    "as a consequence , ratios may be underestimated by a factor of @xmath63 if derived from the main isotopologue .",
    "the co@xmath0 column density presents a significant uncertainty due to its blending with the newly detected isotopologue of methanol , @xmath1ch@xmath2oh .",
    "however , the co@xmath0 abundance should not be affected by more than a factor of 2 .",
    "we have derived a column density for @xmath1ch@xmath2oh of @xmath64 . if we compare this column density with that of the main isotopologue from @xcite it results in a ch@xmath2oh/@xmath1ch@xmath2oh ratio of @xmath65 , significantly lower than the ratio @xmath59c/@xmath1c=40 @xcite .",
    "both the difference of @xmath66 in the observed positions and a different filling factor of ch@xmath2oh might account for part of this difference .",
    "however , the integrated intensities measured for the methanol group of transitions at 145.1ghz by @xcite and @xcite at positions differing by @xmath67 show a variation of @xmath68 so the difference in positions is not likely to contribute to this difference .",
    "thus , opacity is likely the dominant effect as observed in the galactic center ( gc , * ? ? ?",

    "our measured ratios are @xmath73 and @xmath74 , which are @xmath75 larger that the ratios derived by @xcite .",
    "this difference is due to the significant missing flux of the h@xmath1co@xmath0 interferometric maps @xcite they used for comparison , as well the higher @xmath59c/@xmath1c ratio they used to compare with single dish hco@xmath0 observations . by comparing the convolved integrated intensity from the h@xmath1co@xmath0 interferometric maps by @xcite towards the western lobe @xcite and the single dish data of by @xcite towards a nearby position ,",
    "we have estimated a @xmath76 missing flux .",
    "thus we used the h@xmath1co@xmath0 @xmath77 data by @xcite in our measured ratios .",
    "the ratios towards ngc1068 were derived for the regions within the galaxy where lines intensities were tabulated by @xcite .",
    "the observations from @xcite were used to derive the @xmath78 ratio towards ngc4945 .",
    "we find that the three derived hco@xmath0/hoc@xmath0 , hco@xmath0/hco , and hco@xmath0/co@xmath0 abundance ratios in the two starbursts , ngc253 and m82 , are equivalent within the measurement errors .",
    "the ratios are also in reasonable good agreement to those found in galactic sources with similar fuv fluxes ( see table  [ tab : ratios ] ) . such high abundances ratios of hoc@xmath0 , hco , and co@xmath0 relative to hco@xmath0 have been claimed to be the evidence of m82 being mostly dominated by photodissociation .",
    "we notice that the average @xmath78 ratio in ngc253 are even lower than that measured in m82 . in the case of hco",
    ", the interferometric maps of m82 clearly resolve the spatial variations in this ratio across the galaxy nuclear region .",
    "however , towards the region of peak hco emission in the m82 maps , we find a ratio of @xmath79 , equivalent to the average observed towards ngc253 .",
    "our data show that the ism in the nuclear region in ngc253 must be significantly pervaded by a strong uv radiation flux from the massive star clusters formed in the starburst , as also suggested by the study of the abundances of the hnco / cs ratio @xcite .",
    "moreover , these new observations would imply that photodissociation plays a similar role in the ism heating of both ngc253 and m82 .",
    "both @xmath78 and @xmath71 abundance ratios in ngc1068 are different by a factor @xmath80 from those of ngc253 and m82 . furthermore , @xmath78 is also found to be up to a factor of @xmath81 lower in the ring of star formation than towards the nuclear region . like in ngc253 , these ratios are consistent with the decrease in the abundance of molecules such as hnco from the nuclear region to the starburst ring @xcite .",
    "the tentative detection of hco in the circunnuclear disk ( cnd ) of ngc1068 @xcite , suggest a rough @xmath82 to hco line intensity ratio of @xmath83 , which turns into an abundance ratio in the range of @xmath84 , closer to the values derived in sb dominated galaxies .",
    "this value at the cnd can be significantly biased by the emission from the star forming ring covered at half - power by the @xmath19 beam .",
    "therefore , it is clear that this ratio does not significantly decrease towards the nuclear agn in this galaxy with the typical angular resolution of @xmath85 . on the other hand ,",
    "the ratio @xmath71 is only a factor of 2 lower in the starbursts galaxies than towards the nuclear agn in ngc1068 . from these observations ,",
    "it is unclear whether photodissociation does play a major role in the agn dominated center of ngc1068 .",
    "unfortunately , no observations of hoc@xmath0 are available towards the sf ring in this galaxy .",
    "similar to ngc1068 , the obscured seyfert 2 nucleus in ngc4945 is surrounded by a starburst ring more prominent than in ngc1068 @xcite .",
    "the hco@xmath0/hco ratio found in ngc4945 is even lower than that found in the other galaxies .",
    "however , the fit to these lines was claimed to be very uncertain by @xcite .",
    "we have compared our observed fractional abundances and abundance ratios with those predicted by the ucl_pdr model @xcite .",
    "the ucl_pdr code is a time and depth dependent one dimensional pdr model that simultaneously solve the chemistry , thermal balance and radiative transfer within a cloud ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for more details ) .",
    "we have adopted a hydrogen density of @xmath86 , a radiation field @xmath87 in units of habing field , and a cosmic radiation rate of @xmath88 .",
    "the high density of @xmath86 is derived from the multiline analysis of cs and hc@xmath2n ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; aladro et al . in prep ) .",
    "our estimates of the cloud structure ( see sect .",
    "[ sec.gmcinsb ] ) depends on the averaged radiation field which might be different in both galaxies .",
    "the averaged radiation fields in both ngc253 and m82 have been inferred from the fine structure lines and they are of @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively , with large errors of a factor of 2 @xcite .",
    "this would imply that the pdr envelope should be larger in the clouds of ngc253 than in m82 . since we do not aim to quantitatively model the particular abundances measured in ngc253 but to investigate the physical conditions that would give rise to the wealth of observed molecules in starburst , the value of @xmath91 used is a geometric mean value derived from the fine structure lines in both galaxies .",
    "given that our estimates of the @xmath92 for the pdr are based on this geometric mean , the expected changes in @xmath92 for the two galaxies would be just a factor of 1.6 .",
    "we have ran two different models : model a is a standard time dependent gas - phase pdr model where the initial composition is atomic ; while model b is computed using a coupled dense core - pdr model where the diffuse material , initially also purely atomic and gaseous , collapses to reach a final density of @xmath86 . during the collapse",
    "the gas depletes on the grains forming icy mantles which remain on the dust until irradiation from a uv field is switched on , evaporation occurs and the typical pdr chemistry takes place . in both models",
    "the temperature is calculated self - consistently at each depth and time step by thermal balance .",
    "[ fig : pdrmod ] shows the predicted abundances and abundance ratios as a function of visual extinction ( @xmath92 ) for model a ( left panels ) and b ( right panels ) .",

    "[ fig : pdrmod ] .    observed abundances of hco@xmath0 and hoc@xmath0 towards ngc253 ( shown as horizontal lines in the key of fig .",
    "[ fig : pdrmod ] ) are well reproduced by the models for very low extinction of @xmath93 .",
    "the hco abundance observed is a factor @xmath94 above the maximum predicted by the model b. it is important to take into account that while we assumed a ratio co / h@xmath55=10@xmath95 to calculate the fractional abundances , this ratio is not constant in the models and hardly ever reaches this value . on the other hand ,",
    "the abundance ratios of the observed molecules , unaffected by the hydrogen determination uncertainty , agree well with the model predictions .",
    "the model shows that the abundances of co@xmath0 , follows the same pattern as hoc@xmath0 . the correlation between these two molecules",
    "was also predicted by previous theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "thus , co@xmath0 measurement allows us to confirm the effect of photodissociation suggested by the large abundance of hoc@xmath0 .    the ions hoc@xmath0",
    ", co@xmath0 and hoc@xmath0 are mostly formed at the edge of the cloud and while the two models predict similar abundances for these ions , it is worth noting that the observed abundances of other species such as hnco , ch@xmath2oh , or hoco@xmath0 can only be explained with model b. however , hnco and ch@xmath2oh only reach observable abundances for @xmath96 magnitudes .",
    "this implies that , while photodissociation does play an important role in the chemistry of ngc253 , the molecular clouds affected by the uv radiation must contain a dense core well shielded from the uv radiation and rich with gas phase icy mantle molecules like hnco and ch@xmath2oh .",
    "@xcite have used a comparison with the gc molecular clouds to propose another pdr diagnostic based on the relative abundance of hnco to cs .",
    "the large variation of the hnco / cs abundance ratio between uv radiated clouds to those well shielded clouds only affected by shocks was interpreted as the fast photodissociation of the fragile molecule hnco , efficiently produced on the icy mantles and delivered into gas phase by low velocity shocks .",
    "similarly , in a sample of nearby galaxies @xcite found changes of nearly two orders of magnitude from the shock dominated chemistry in m83 and ic342 to uv dominated chemistry in m82 . the extremely low hnco abundance in m82 and the large abundances of hco , hoc@xmath0 and co@xmath0 support the idea that the hnco / cs ratio is a measure of the relative importance of the uv heating to shock heating and the evolutionary state of the starburst in galaxies .",
    "the detection of hco , hoc@xmath0 and co@xmath0 in ngc253 with similar column densities and abundance to those in m82 suggest that the pdr component is similar in both galaxies as suggested by the similar atomic fine structure line intensities in both galaxies .",
    "the results of model b confirm the observational trends observed in hnco and the other pdr molecules in galaxies . for molecular clouds with @xmath93 ( i.e column densities of @xmath97 ) illuminated by a strong uv radiation field like in the galaxies in our sample , hnco and ch@xmath2oh",
    "are largely photodissociated and only hco , hoc@xmath0 and co@xmath0 should be observed like in m82 @xcite .",
    "then , not very massive molecular clouds and widely translucent to the uv radiation should dominate in m82 . on the other hand , for galaxies with massive molecular clouds ( large visual extinction ) or low uv radiation fields , hnco and ch@xmath2oh",
    "are well shielded and the abundance ratio of hnco / cs will reach its maximum value . considering that m83 and ic342 represent the stage of galaxies with an extremely low pdr component ,",
    "the lower hnco / cs ratios measured for ngc253 , ngc4945 and ngc1068 indicate that the pdr component must be substantial , as observed in other pdr tracers .    for ngc253",
    "we find that the pdr component is similar to that in m82 , but the total column density of dense gas is a factor of 2 - 3 larger in ngc253 than in m82 from the low hnco and ch@xmath2oh abundance in the latter .",
    "considering the pdr column densities in both galaxies are similar , this component should represent about @xmath98 of the total molecular column density in ngc253 .",
    "this is roughly consistent with the decrease by a factor of @xmath80 of the hnco / cs ratio as compared with that of m83 or ic342 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the molecular clouds properties in m82 and ngc253 must be quite different in terms of the total molecular column density , which implies that the sizes or the densities are different , or a combination of both . using the atomic fine structure and co emission lines , @xcite and @xcite",
    "have also proposed that the clouds in m82 and ngc253 are quite different .",
    "the clouds in ngc253 are slightly smaller than those in m82 , but with masses a factor of 15 larger than for m82 .",
    "the ngc253 average cloud column densities are therefore factor of 20 larger than in m82 . though the total column densities of the m82 clouds inferred from the atomic fine structure lines are a factor of 5 larger than those predicted from the pdrs tracers and the hnco abundance in this galaxy , similar constrains",
    "are derived both the molecular and the atomic tracers .",
    "therefore , the clouds in ngc253 are more massive than in m82 .",
    "we can even make a very rough estimate of the average properties and structure of the molecular clouds in ngc253 and m82 by combining the complementary information obtained from the pdr tracers presented in this paper and the hnco column densities from @xcite .",
    "while hco , hoc@xmath0 and co@xmath0 mainly trace the pdr region up to @xmath99 ( i.e. h@xmath55 column densities of @xmath100 ) , the hnco emission only arises from the well shielded core ( @xmath101 ) of the molecular clouds .",
    "the hco , hoc@xmath0 and co@xmath0 column densities in ngc253 and m82 indicate similar averaged column densities in the pdr envelopes of the molecular clouds in both galaxies .",
    "the big difference in the molecular cloud structure in both galaxies is in the size ( h@xmath55 column density ) of the well shielded cores of the molecular clouds . in the case of m82 , where hnco has not been detected , we can set an upper limit to the hnco column density of @xmath102 .",
    "this translates to a upper limit to the core h@xmath55 column density of @xmath103 for the hnco fractional abundance of @xmath104 derived for the well shielded clouds in the galactic center @xcite .",
    "the averaged shielded cloud cores in m82 are smaller by more than one order of magnitude than the pdr envelope . in the case of ngc253 ,",
    "the h@xmath55 column densities of the shielded cloud cores is @xmath105 , a factor of 2 larger than pdr envelope .",
    "assuming a similar averaged density distribution in the molecular clouds in both galaxies , the clouds in ngc253 would be a factor @xmath80 larger than in m82 .",
    "the pdr model presented by @xcite failed to reproduce the large co@xmath0 column density of a few @xmath106 observed towards m82 .",
    "this lead @xcite to explore the possibility of an enhanced x - ray induced chemistry in this galaxy .",
    "@xcite concluded that such high formation of co@xmath0 can only be explained by x - ray irradiated molecular gas with densities of @xmath107 . although the x - ray luminosity of ngc253 is a factor of @xmath108 below that of m82 , both galaxies have a significant x - ray emission in the range of @xmath109 @xcite .",
    "similar to m82 , the ngc253 total co@xmath0 column density is @xmath110 .",
    "moreover , both show a similar hco@xmath0/co@xmath0 ratio of @xmath111 .",
    "the models presented in this paper are able to produce such column densities for visual extinctions of @xmath112 for model a , and @xmath113 for model b. these models have been calculated with a radiation field , a cosmic ray flux and a h@xmath55 density smaller by a factor of 2 , 40 and 4 , respectively , with respect to those assumed in the models of @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we are able to reproduce the abundances and abundance ratios measured for all the other observed species presented in this paper . @xcite",
    "showed how the measured abundance of @xmath114 in m82 can be both produced by pdr with a high cosmic - ray ionization or by an xdr .",
    "indeed , an increase of cosmic ray ionization rate in pdr models may be qualitatively used to simulate xdr - like environments .",
    "our models , however , do not use particularly high cosmic ray fluxes ( a factor of 5 higher than standard ) .",
    "thus , though the x - ray irradiation is substantial in sb galaxies , the pdr models presented in this paper can reproduce the molecular abundances observed towards the brightest prototypes , m82 and ngc253 .",
    "moreover , no significant changes in the abundances of hoc@xmath0 and hco are found towards the nuclear agn of ngc1068 where x - ray radiation is significantly more important than in sb nuclei , as shown in sect .",
    "[ sect.pdr_agn ] .",
    "unfortunately , no co@xmath0 observation has been reported towards this seyfert 2 nucleus .",
    "the comparison of model predictions with the observations presented show that the abundance of the species observed in this work towards ngc253 , namely hco@xmath0 , co@xmath0 , and hco , are most efficiently formed in the outer region of the molecular clouds where the gas is highly irradiated by the incident uv photons from massive stars .",
    "the high molecular abundances derived for these species in ngc253 suggest that the pdr component in this galaxy is similar to that found in m82 , claimed to be the prototype of extragalactic pdr .",
    "the abundance ratios found for this limited sample of galaxies are of the same order as those observed towards galactic pdrs , which stress the importance of photo - dominated chemistry in galaxy nuclei .",
    "large amounts of molecular material are affected by photodissociation not only in ngc253 , but also towards the star forming regions around the seyfert 2 nuclei in ngc4945 and ngc1068 .",
    "this is consistent with the hnco / cs ratio in these galaxies which suggest that a fraction of hnco has been photodissociated in pdrs . the combination of the observations of hco , hoc@xmath0 and co@xmath0 with that of hnco seems to confirm that their abundances reflect the evolutionary stage of the starbursts in these galaxies .",
    "although photodissociation is the most likely scenario for the enhancement of the observed reactive ion in starburst environments , x - ray dominated chemistry has been claimed to be responsible for the high abundances observed around agns in circunnuclear disk of ngc1068 ( hoc@xmath0 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and towards the ultra luminous infrared galaxy arp220 ( @xmath114 * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , m82 is still outstanding not only as a pdr dominated galaxy , but by the underabundance of complex molecules such as ch@xmath2oh , hnco or sio @xcite , evidence for the lack of large amounts of dense molecular material which would potentially fuel its nuclear starburst as compared to other starburst galaxies like ngc253 @xcite .",
    "our data in combination with the hnco abundances @xcite indicate that the molecular clouds in m82 are different from those in ngc253 .",
    "although having a similar overall pdr component , the clouds in ngc253 have to be more massive and have larger column densities those in m82 .",
