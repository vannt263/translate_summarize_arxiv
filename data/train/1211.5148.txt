    "subsequent work has characterized the scattered light in great detail , exploiting its proximity to constrain its radial and vertical structure @xcite .",
    "observations of dust emission at ( sub)millimeter wavelengths provide important , complementary information about debris disk structures . unlike the small grains probed at optical and near - infrared wavelengths that react strongly to stellar radiation and wind forces , the large grains that dominate the millimeter - wave emission have dynamics more like the parent planetesimals . as a result ,",
    "long - wavelength images trace best the location and distribution of the larger colliding bodies @xcite , and potentially also the signatures of planets that interact with them @xcite .",
    "these size - dependent dust dynamics manifest beautifully in the edge - on au  mic disk . resolved millimeter - wave observations show an emission belt within the extended optical disk that peaks near a radius of @xmath10  au , where the midplane scattered light profile steepens dramatically @xcite .",
    "these features are elegantly explained by the presence of a `` birth ring '' of planetesimals at that location , where small grains released in a collisional cascade are launched into an extended halo @xcite .    with the advent of the atacama large millimeter array ( alma )",

    "letter _ , we present new , sub - arcsecond resolution alma cycle  0 observations of au  mic at @xmath11  mm .",
    "the alma data provide substantially improved constraints on the locations of colliding planetesimals in the au  mic disk and help shed light on the processes that may be shaping the planetesimal distribution .",
    "they also reveal a previously unknown , centrally located emission feature .",
    "au  mic was observed by alma with its band  6 receivers over four 2hour - long  scheduling blocks \" ( sbs ) in 2012 apr and jun .",
    "table  [ tab : obs ] summarizes the observations .",
    "the 16 - 20 operational 12-m antennas were arranged to span baseline lengths of 21402 m ( corresponding to a maximum resolution of @xmath006 ) .",
    "the correlator was configured to optimize continuum sensitivity , processing two polarizations in four 2ghz - wide basebands , each with 128 spectral channels , centered at 226 , 228 , 242 , and 244ghz . in each sb , we interleaved observations of au  mic ( pointing center @xmath12 , @xmath13 , j2000 , within 1  of the star position at all epochs ) with the nearby quasar j2101@xmath14295 .",
    "the data from each sb were calibrated independently within the casa software package . after applying system temperature measurements and phase corrections from the water vapor radiometers ,",
    "the data were flagged and averaged into 6.048s integrations .",
    "a calibration of the spectral response of the system was determined from observations of j1924@xmath14292 , and complex gain variations induced by atmospheric and instrumental effects were corrected using observations of j2101@xmath14295 .",
    "the absolute flux calibration was derived from observations of neptune : a mean calibration was applied to all basebands , with a systematic uncertainty of @xmath010%  ( see  3.3 ) . to generate an image at the mean frequency ,",
    "235ghz ( 1.28 mm ) , we fourier inverted the calibrated visibilities with natural weighting and performed a multi - frequency synthesis deconvolution with the clean algorithm .",
    "the visibilities were further reduced by spectrally averaging over the central 112 channels in each baseband and re - weighted by the observed scatter .",

    "49 , and rms of 30@xmath6jy  beam@xmath18 .",
    "an image constructed from all 4 sbs is consistent but noisier , which we attribute to systematic calibration issues resulting from the poorer weather conditions of the earlier observations .",
    "the emission is confined to a narrow band with aspect ratio @xmath1910:1 , with an orientation consistent with the scattered light disk .",
    "the emission is not resolved in the direction perpendicular to the elongation .",
    "there are clear peaks near both extrema and in the middle of the structure ( detected at all four epochs ) .",
    "the emission is marginally brighter at the northwest end than the southeast end , and shows small undulations along its length , though none of these variations are significant .",
    "we interpret the observed structure as a superposition of two components : ( 1 ) the nearly edge - on dust belt with limb - brightened ansae , and ( 2 ) a new , distinct , and compact feature located at the center of the belt .",
    "building on the phenomenological methodology of @xcite to analyze resolved millimeter emission from debris disks , we construct a parametric model to quantify the observed properties of the au  mic emission .",
    "we consider two model components : a vertically thin , axisymmetric  outer \" belt , and an additional source to account for the central peak .",
    "the belt component is informed by models of the scattered light that show the disk midplane within 50au is remarkably straight , @xmath705 from edge - on , and thin ( fwhm @xmath003 ) .",
    "we assume the belt is viewed at an inclination of 895 .",
    "the belt is characterized as an annulus with ( unprojected ) radial intensity @xmath20 for @xmath21 , with a normalization defined by @xmath22 , a center determined by offsets ( relative to the pointing center ) \\{@xmath23 , @xmath24 } , and an orientation described by a position angle ( pa ) .",
    "we treat the central component as a circular gaussian with mean @xmath25 , variance @xmath26 ( half width at half maximum @xmath27 ) , and flux density @xmath28 .",
    "the mean @xmath25 is defined as a radial shift from the belt center _ in the plane of the belt_. we also include power - law spectral scalings between the 4 basebands for each component , denoted @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 .    for a given parameter set ,",
    "we compute four synthetic visibility sets sampled at the same spatial frequencies observed by alma , corresponding to the spectrally averaged basebands ( at 226 , 228 , 242 , and 244ghz ) . by fitting the visibility data directly ,",
    "we are not sensitive to the non - linear effects of deconvolution , and take advantage of the full range of available spatial frequencies . the fit quality is quantified by a likelihood metric , @xmath32 , determined from the @xmath33 values summed over the real and imaginary components at all spatial frequencies ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "a monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) approach was utilized to characterize the multi - dimensional parameter space of this model and determine the posterior probability distribution functions for each parameter .",
    "we used the affine - invariant ensemble sampler proposed by @xcite , in a locally - modified version of the parallelized implementation described by @xcite , to compute likelihood values for @xmath010@xmath35 mcmc trials .",
    "uniform priors were assumed for all parameters , with bounds imposed to ensure that the model was well - defined : \\{@xmath36 , @xmath28 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "the best - fit parameter values and their 68%  uncertainties determined from the marginalized posterior probability distributions are listed in table [ tab : model ] .",
    "the data and best - fit model are compared in the image plane in figure  [ fig : model ] ; there are no significant residuals .",
    "the best - fit model has a reduced @xmath39 ( 905,920 independent datapoints , 12 free parameters ) .",
    "the modeling procedure was performed on each sb individually and the full dataset ( all 4 sbs together ) .",
    "the results were entirely consistent , although the parameter uncertainties were notably smaller from the superior sb-4 dataset alone , and we focus on those results .    most parameters are determined with high precision .",
    "we find good agreement of the outer belt parameters \\{@xmath36 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 } with the less well - constrained fits of @xcite , and on the disk pa from measurements of scattered starlight ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we measure a flat spectrum for the outer belt ( @xmath42 ) across the 4 basebands , which corresponds to the _ difference _ between the spectral slopes of au  mic and neptune ( @xmath43 ) , consistent with data from 350@xmath6 m to 1.3 mm @xcite .",
    "the central emission peak is detected with high confidence at @xmath44@xmath6jy ( @xmath1910@xmath45 brighter than the outer belt at that location ) .",
    "it is unresolved , with @xmath46au ( 3@xmath45 ) , and positionally coincident with the outer belt center : @xmath47au ( 3@xmath45 ) . regarding the outer belt , the most notable result is that the models strongly favor rising emission profiles with large , positive gradients : @xmath48 .",
    "models with the standard assumption of @xmath49 produce significant residuals , under - predicting the intensities at @xmath501 - 2  from the belt center .",
    "because of the steep increase in the emission profile , there is only a weak constraint on the inner edge of the outer belt .",
    "the best - fit @xmath40 deviates from 0 at the @xmath02@xmath45 level : the 3@xmath45 limit is @xmath51au .",
    "we have presented new , sub - arcsecond resolution alma observations of 1.3 mm emission from the au  mic debris disk and analyzed the data with a simple parametric model .",
    "this emission is resolved into two distinct components : ( 1 ) an edge - on outer belt with an emission profile that _ rises _ with radius out to 40  au , and ( 2 ) an unresolved peak at the center of the outer belt .",
    "this distribution is more complex than the single , narrow ring often assumed for debris disks .",
    "however , it has some similarities to other nearby resolved systems , like @xmath52  eri @xcite or hr  8799 @xcite , that show an inner component inferred from excess infrared emission , separate from an extended and colder outer belt .",
    "the stellar photosphere is much fainter than the central peak noted in figure [ fig : image ] . a nextgen stellar model @xcite with @xmath53k , @xmath54l@xmath55 , and @xmath56m@xmath55 ( e.g. , * ? ?",

    "* ) that matches the au  mic photometry from 0.425@xmath6 m contributes only @xmath57@xmath6jy at 1.3 mm , @xmath06@xmath58 fainter than observed .",
    "however , au  mic is an active star that exhibits radio - wave bursts . in quiescence",
    ", observations find @xmath59120  @xmath6jy at 3.6 cm @xcite , and the contribution at 1.3 mm from hot coronal plasma seen in x - rays is unlikely to be significant ( though better spectral constraints are desirable , see * ? ? ?",
    "flares are detected from au  mic at @xmath0200 - 1200@xmath6jy at 6 cm @xcite , but this non - thermal emission is much weaker at 1.3 mm . while the unknown variability makes any extrapolation to 1.3 mm problematic , the temporal properties of the alma emission provide additional information .",
    "radio - wave flares have fast decay times , of order an hour @xcite ; but , the mm - wave peak persists at a consistent intensity in all four alma observations , within uncertainties that are typically @xmath60 larger than for sb-4 , spanning timescales from 1 hour ( within sb-4 ) to 2 months ( sb-1 to sb-4 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the spectral index ( @xmath30 ) constraints are not good enough to be diagnostic .",
    "we suspect that stellar emission is too weak and too ephemeral to be responsible for the 1.3 mm peak , but the available data does not allow for a firm determination of its contribution .",
    "alternatively , the central emission peak could be produced by dust in a distinct ( unresolved ) planetesimal belt located close to the star . in ",
    "3.3 , we constrained the extent of this peak to @xmath61au ( 3@xmath45 ) , inside the inner working angle ( @xmath62au ) of all previous high resolution imaging of scattered light @xcite .",
    "rough models of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) from the alma central peak can help assess the feasibility that it originates in an inner dust belt . in this context ,",
    "the most salient feature of the au  mic sed is the absence of emission excess at @xmath63@xmath6 m ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we assume the central peak represents the combined emission from the star and dust , such that @xmath64mjy at 1.3 mm .",
    "optically thin dust emission at a temperature , @xmath65 , has @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the opacity spectrum , @xmath68 the planck function , @xmath69 the mass , and @xmath70pc . for a given dust population characterized by @xmath67",
    ", we computed the maximum @xmath65 ( and minimum @xmath69 ) consistent with both the observed millimeter flux density and the infrared sed .",
    "we calculated various @xmath67 for dust with the @xcite `` astrosilicate '' composition and a power - law size distribution @xmath71 between @xmath72@xmath6 m ( the blow - out size ; * ? ? ? * ) and @xmath73 values from 1@xmath6 m to 1 cm . for @xmath74 @xmath6 m ,",
    "models of the central peak over - predict the observed 60 - 70 @xmath6 m emission if @xmath75 k. however , larger grains with @xmath76  mm at temperatures up to @xmath77k can be accommodated without producing an excess at @xmath63 @xmath6 m .",
    "these maximum @xmath65 values are comparable to the expected dust temperatures a few au from the star , compatible with the emission size constraints ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "the corresponding minimum @xmath69 is @xmath0@xmath79 g , about 1%  of the lunar mass .",
    "these calculations show that the central emission peak is consistent with a cool dust belt located @xmath73au from the central star , with a total mass comparable to the asteroid belt in our solar system .",
    "if this interpretation is correct , then alma observations at higher resolution can determine its properties .",
    "interestingly , the temperature of this putative inner belt is colder than the @xmath80k found to apply systematically to inner belts around f5-k0 stars by @xcite .",
    "our modeling of the alma data locates the far edge of the outer emission belt with high precision , @xmath81au , which matches closely the outer edge of the hypothesized `` birth ring '' of colliding planetesimals .",
    "this analysis does not define the shape of the edge below the @xmath4au resolution limit , but the truncation is reminiscent of the outer edge of the classical kuiper belt ( @xmath82au ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the origins of such sharp edges remain unclear : they could be from dynamical interactions @xcite , or they may simply represent the initial conditions , where planetesimal formation was efficient and successful in the primordial disk . adopting the opacity used in  4.1 ( @xmath67 = 2.7@xmath83g@xmath18 ) , and assuming @xmath84k ( for 35 - 45au ) , the dust mass of this outer belt is @xmath85 g ( consistent with previous estimates ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath0100@xmath58 more massive than the hypothesized inner belt ; the kuiper belt and asteroid belt have a similar mass ratio .",
    "the mm - wave emission morphologies of cold belts of dusty debris reflect the dynamical processes that shape the underlying planetesimal distributions . for au  mic",
    ", our modeling suggests that its outer emission belt can be described by an increasing emission profile with a positive radial power - law index @xmath86 .",
    "if we assume the emitting dust is in radiative equilibrium with a temperature profile @xmath87 , this implies a rising surface density profile , @xmath88 , strongly peaked near 40au .",
    "a broad parent body ring with constant surface density would produce a radial intensity profile with @xmath89 , a value ruled out with high confidence ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "a rising behavior is predicted for  self - stirred \" disks with ongoing planet formation @xcite ; in particular , the models of @xcite suggest @xmath91",
    ". however , the timescale required to assemble pluto - sized bodies at @xmath040au to initiate a collisional cascade around a low - mass star like au  mic is much longer than its @xmath010myr age @xcite .",
    "moreover , this scenario does not naturally accommodate the presence of a separate , interior planetesimal belt .",
    "of course , the still modest resolution of the data is compatible with more complex scenarios , such as multiple closely - spaced belts of different brightnesses that mimic a smooth gradient .",
    "scattered light observations of the au  mic disk show asymmetries on both large and small scales , with several peaks and depressions projected against the broad ansae in figure [ fig : image ] , at radii beyond the millimeter undulations ( features a - e ; see * ? ? ?",
    "with such a steep emission gradient in this outer belt , the data do not strongly constrain its width , or the location of its inner edge .",
    "our modeling indicates substantial emission from mm - sized grains interior to 40au , in the @xmath020 - 40au zone inferred to be highly depleted of @xmath6m - sized grains from polarized scattered light @xcite .",
    "the alma data show no clear evidence for asymmetries or substructure that would signal planet - disk interactions .",
    "the hints of modulating millimeter brightness along the belt in figure  [ fig : image ] are insignificant in the residuals from subtracting a symmetric parametric model ( see figure [ fig : model ] ) .",
    "this rules out substructure brighter than 90@xmath6jy beam@xmath18 ( 3@xmath45 ) , corresponding to dust clumps @xmath92%  of the lunar mass ( for the dust properties adopted above ) .",
    "those limits argue against over - densities of dust - producing planetesimals trapped in mean motion resonances @xcite , as might arise from the outward migration of planets @xcite .",
    "given the young age of the system , the broad and smooth character of the outer belt in the au  mic disk may resemble the kuiper belt prior to the epoch of neptune s migration @xcite . it is interesting that none of the claims of millimeter emission clumps in debris disks have survived scrutiny at higher sensitivity @xcite .",
    "it may be that any such features are effectively erased by collisions @xcite .",
    "we also find no significant centroid offset between the outer belt and central peak , as might result from the secular perturbations of a planet in an eccentric orbit @xcite .",
    "the limit on the displacement , @xmath93au ( 3@xmath45 ) , corresponds approximately to a limit on @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the semi - major axis and @xmath96 is the eccentricity .",
    "this limit can still accommodate a wide - orbit planet with modest eccentricity , similar to uranus .",
    "such a planet could be responsible for stirring the disk to 40au in @xmath010  myr ( e.g. for @xmath97au and @xmath98 , see eqn .",
    "15 of * ? ?",
    "limits from high contrast direct imaging admit saturn - mass planets at these separations @xcite .",
    "the basic architecture of the au  mic debris disk appears remarkably similar to the solar system , with a potential analog to the asteroid belt at a few au , and a colder , more massive , and apparently truncated counterpart of the kuiper belt extending to 40au .",
    "future observations are needed to determine if stellar processes could be responsible for emission attributed to the asteroid belt , and to determine if the solar system analogy extends to include a planetary system like our own .",
