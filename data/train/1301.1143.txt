    "usually carried out in magneto - optical traps holding up to 10@xmath4 atoms at temperatures between @xmath5k and a phase space density many orders of magnitude lower , only a small fraction of atom pairs resides at sufficiently short interatomic separations to be photoassociated .",

    "almost all of the molecules produced by photoassociation can thus be transferred to the rovibrational ground state , in contrast to all previous photoassociation schemes realized experimentally to date .",
    "we have shown that the photoassociation rate of sr@xmath6 molecules is enhanced by three orders of magnitude by applying an additional non - resonant field .",
    "this enhancement is due to shape resonances and scattering states becoming bound , causing a larger number of atom pairs to be quasi - trapped at sufficiently short interatomic separations to be photoassociated .",

    "the enhancement of the photoassociation rate is accompanied by strong hybridization of the angular motion , which we have fully accounted for in a rigorous treatment of the coupled rovibrational motion .",
    "prior to photoassociation , the non - resonant field needs to be switched on slowly such that the position of shape resonances and scattering states is shifted adiabatically to lower energies .",

    "alternatively , a sudded switch - off leads to a superposition of ground state molecules with the three lowest rotational quantum numbers , @xmath156 , @xmath157 and @xmath158 , occupied .",
    "the required non - resonant field intensities of the order of @xmath0w/@xmath1 can be achieved by employing intra - cavity beams . assuming a spot size of the order of 10@xmath34 m , intra - cavity powers of up to @xmath159w are needed .",
    "such powers can realistically be produced , for example , by injecting @xmath160w from a single mode telecom wavelength fiber laser into a cavity with a power build - up factor of one hundred .",
