    "brans - dicke ( bd ) theory is considered as a natural extension of einstein s general theory of relativity @xcite , where the gravitational constant becomes time dependent varying as inverse of a time dependent scalar field which couples to gravity with a coupling parameter @xmath0 .",
    "many of the cosmological problems @xcite@xcite can be successfully explained by using this theory .",
    "one important property of bd theory is that it gives simple expanding solutions @xcite@xcite for the scalar field @xmath1 and the scale factor @xmath2 which are compatible with solar system observations @xcite@xcite , in which impose lower bound on @xmath0 ( @xmath3 ) @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "recent observational data give a strong motivation to study general properties of friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmological models containing more than one fluid ( for example , see @xcite ) .",
    "usually the universe is modeled with perfect fluids and with mixtures of non interacting perfect fluids .",
    "however there are no observational data confirming that this is the only possible scenario .",
    "this means that we can consider plausible cosmological models containing fluids which interact with each other .    in this work",
    ", we follow the authors in @xcite but apply the two fluid interaction in frw bd cosmologies . in this case the transfers of energy among these fluids in relation to the bd scalar field play an important role in the formalism .",
    "there are many cosmological situations with the exchange of energy that will be investigated in this work .",
    "although the interaction between for example dust - like matter and radiation was previously considered in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , the application in bd cosmology gives us new insight to the expansion of the universe and the effect of bd scalar field on the subject .",
    "we start with the bd action for frw universes filled with two perfect fluids with energy densities @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the friedmann equation is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 .",
    "we assume that the two perfect fluids interact through the interaction term @xmath8 according to @xmath9 although the nature of the @xmath8 term is not clear at all , for @xmath10 there exists a transfer of energy from fluid with @xmath5 to the fluid with @xmath4 .",
    "also for @xmath11 there are two non - interacting fluids , each separately satisfies the standard conservation equation . in the following",
    "we study the dynamics of the universe for closed , open and flat universes separately .",
    "let us now consider frw cosmological models with @xmath12 filled with interacting matter sources which satisfy the barotropic equation of state , i.e. @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are equation of state ( eos ) parameters .",
    "we assume that the scale factor and the bd scalar field behave as @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are constants .",
    "this implies that @xmath20 . by taking into account the curvature term @xmath21 of equation ( [ 1 ] )",
    ", we conclude that @xmath22 in order to obtain energy density scales over scalar field on the rhs of the equation in the same manner as the curvature term in the lhs .",
    "since @xmath23 has no acceleration , the universe will either expand or collapse with constant velocity .",
    "now , from equation ( [ 1 ] ) and the resultant equation from the addition of equations ( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) we obtain @xmath24 the interacting term is also found to be , @xmath25 which may be rewritten as @xmath26 this implies that it is proportional to the expansion rate of the universe and to one of the individual densities , so @xmath27",
    ".    for the condition @xmath28 , and by defining @xmath29 , the densities ( [ 5 ] ) and ( [ 5 ] ) become , @xmath30 alternatively for @xmath31 and taking @xmath32 , we have @xmath33 as can be seen , in figure ( 1a ) , if we assume that one of the fluids is dust , for different values of @xmath19 , for a particular @xmath14 where @xmath34 , non of the fluid dominate . before the crossing point",
    "@xmath35 dominates and after it @xmath36 dominates .",
    "as @xmath19 decreases , the domination of @xmath36 over @xmath35 occurs at larger value of negative @xmath14 while @xmath15 represent dust . also for those values of @xmath19 that @xmath37 , the weak energy condition ( wec ) ( @xmath38 ) is not satisfied and there exist no physical interpretation . in figure ( 1b ) where @xmath39 ,",
    "we have the same argument and the only difference is that the curves are shifted smoothly to the right .         also , for the condition @xmath40 as shown in figures ( 2a ) and ( 2b ) , the wec is not satisfied and therefore these is no physical interpretation for this case .         from wec and supposing that @xmath41 , and for the condition @xmath42 , we have @xmath43 similarly for the condition @xmath44 , we have @xmath45 from these expressions we conclude that for @xmath46 , always one of the interacting fluids must be either a dark or a phantom fluid .",
    "for example the constraints ( [ 13 ] ) on the eos parameters imply that @xmath47 , so the energy is transferred from a fluid with ( @xmath48 ) or a phantom ( @xmath49 ) fluid to the dark component whose eos parameter is @xmath50 .",
    "also the constraint ( [ 14 ] ) on the eos parameters imply that @xmath51 , so the energy is transferred from a matter component whose eos parameter is @xmath52 to a dark ( @xmath53 ) or a phantom ( @xmath49 ) fluid",
    ".    the constant ratio of energies defined by @xmath54 is another important factor that we consider in here . as can be seen , it is a @xmath55 independent function of the model eos parameters @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath19 . for cosmological scenarios which satisfy the requirement ( [ 13 ] ) , we have @xmath56 .",
    "thus , @xmath35 dominates over @xmath36 . on the other hand , for those which satisfy ( [ 14 ] ) , we have @xmath57 and @xmath36 dominates over @xmath35 .      from equations ( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ 2 ] ) , and ( [ 3 ] ) for flat frw model",
    "we conclude that the general solution for energy distributions are given by , @xmath58 the interacting @xmath8-term takes the form @xmath59 or in terms of the expansion rate of the universe and to one of the individual densities , @xmath60 from equation ( [ 17 ] ) we conclude that @xmath61 . for the condition @xmath62 , and by definition @xmath63 one gets @xmath64}{3(\\gamma_2-\\gamma_1)}\\tau^{n\\alpha-2 } , \\\\    \\label{20 }    \\rho_{20}(\\tau)=-\\frac{\\alpha[(3+n+3\\gamma_1)\\alpha-2]}{3(\\gamma_2-\\gamma_1)}\\tau^{n\\alpha-2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] alternatively , for the condition @xmath65 , and @xmath66 we obtain @xmath67}{3(\\gamma_2-\\gamma_1)}\\tau^{n\\alpha-2 } , \\\\",

    "now let us examine two interesting cases .",
    "@xmath72 dust - perfect fluid interaction ( @xmath73 , @xmath74 ) . for the condition @xmath68 , and from equations .",
    "( [ 19 ] ) and ( [ 20 ] ) , we have @xmath75 also , for the condition @xmath70 , and from equations ( [ 21 ] ) and ( [ 22 ] ) , we have @xmath76 for the requirement of simultaneous fulfillment of the conditions @xmath77 , @xmath78 and from equations ( [ 23])-([25 ] ) the following constraints must be satisfied for the case @xmath79 @xmath80 also for @xmath70 and from equations ( [ 26])-([28 ] ) we obtain , @xmath81 as a specific example , we shall now consider in some detail the dust - radiation interaction ( @xmath82 ) . in this case",
    "we have for @xmath68 @xmath83\\tau^{n\\alpha-2},\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ p_1=0 , \\\\    \\label{39 } \\rho_{20}&=&-\\alpha[(n+3)\\alpha-2]\\tau^{n\\alpha-2},\\ \\ p_2=\\frac{1}{3}\\rho_{20}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the condition @xmath70 , we have , @xmath84\\tau^{n\\alpha-2},\\   \\ p_1=0 , \\\\",
    "\\label{40 } \\rho_{20}&=&\\alpha[(n+3)\\alpha-2]\\tau^{n\\alpha-2},\\ \\ \\ \\   p_2=\\frac{1}{3}\\rho_{20}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in figure ( 3a ) , where @xmath68 , for different values of @xmath19 , we first have radiation dominated and then dust dominated .",
    "since the universe in both radiation and dust dominated has to be in deceleration phase , we expect that dust domination continues only till @xmath85 .",
    "in addition , from figure ( 3a ) , @xmath19 under no condition can be greater than @xmath86 , since @xmath18 becomes greater than one and the universe starts to accelerate which contradicts the universe decelerating behaviour in radiation dominated and matter dominated era .",
    "further , it can be seen that as @xmath19 decreases , the crossing of the dust and radiation distributions takes place at greater values . as shown in figure ( 3b )",
    ", there is no physical solution for the case @xmath70 .",
    "@xmath87 phantom - perfect fluid interaction ( say @xmath88 , @xmath74 ) . for the condition @xmath68",
    ", we have @xmath89 for the condition @xmath70 , @xmath90    as a specific example we shall now consider in some detail the phantom - dust interaction ( @xmath91 )",
    ". in this case we have for @xmath68 , @xmath92 for @xmath70 , @xmath93         from figure ( 4a ) , one can see that matter domination occurs before phantom domination .",
    "further , it can be seen that as @xmath19 decreases , the crossing of the phantom and dust distributions takes place at greater values of @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , for @xmath22 when the universe starts accelerating and phantom dominates over matter , the value of @xmath19 is one . figure ( 4b )",
    "shows no physical interpretation for the case @xmath70 .",
    "in this section we study the conditions under which the two interacting sources are equivalent to an effective fluid described as the interaction of two - fluid mixture .",
    "this can be made by introducing an effective pressure @xmath94 , i.e. @xmath95 which has an equation of state given by @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the effective eos parameter .",
    "note that the equation of state of associated effective fluid is not produced by physical particles and their interaction[17 ] .",
    "making some algebraic manipulations with equations ( [ 37 ] ) and ( [ 38 ] ) we find that the the effective eos parameter , @xmath97 , is related to the parameter @xmath18 by , @xmath98}.\\ ] ] we also find the behavior of the bd parameter @xmath0 in terms of @xmath19 ( @xmath99)in :    _ inflation era _ ( @xmath100 , @xmath101 ) :   @xmath102 @xmath103    _ radiation dominated era _ ( @xmath104 , @xmath105 ) :  @xmath106    _ matter dominated era _",
    "( @xmath107 , @xmath108 ) :    @xmath109    _ dark energy dominated era _ ( @xmath110 , @xmath101 )",
    ":  @xmath111    it shows that in the inflation and cosmological constant era the behaviour of @xmath0 in terms of @xmath19 is different from in radiation and matter dominated era . in case of @xmath112 ( or @xmath113 ) eq.([39 ] ) becomes , @xmath114 in compatible with the standard cosmology .",
    "that is , in radiation era where @xmath115 , the eos parameter becomes @xmath116 , in matter dominated era where @xmath117 , the eos parameter becomes zero , in inflation era where @xmath118 , the eos parameter becomes @xmath119 and in the current dark energy era where @xmath18 is just greater than one , the eos parameter becomes about @xmath120 which is compatible with the observational data .",
    "in this paper we have provided a detailed description for power law scaling cosmological models in the case of a frw universe in bd theory dominated by two interacting perfect fluid components during the expansion .",
    "we have shown that in this mathematical description it is possible for each fluid component to require that the wec may be simultaneously fulfilled in order to have reasonable physical values of eos parameters in the formulation .",
    "so from the required conditions we may gain some insights for understanding essential features of two fluid interactions in power law frw bd cosmologies . in closed or open universes , if one of the fluids is dust or radiation , the second fluid has to be dark energy or phantom .",
    "as the power of bd scalar field , @xmath19 , a function of time , decreases , the second fluid changes its behaviour from dark energy to phantom . if one of the fluids is radiation , the change of behaviour of the second fluid , as @xmath19 decreases , is slower in comparison to the dust fluid .    in flat universes ,",
    "if the two fluids are dust and radiation , their behaviuor as a function of scale factor power of time , @xmath18 , changes with @xmath19 .",
    "it has been shown that as @xmath19 decreases , the domination of dust over radiation occurs for smaller values of @xmath18 .",
    "it also gives us a constraint on @xmath19 not to be greater than values that makes the universe accelerate .",
    "similarly , if the two fluids are phantom and dust , again their behaviour as a function of @xmath18 changes with @xmath19 .",
    "firstly , for a particular @xmath19 , the domination of dust occurs before the domination of phantom .",
    "secondly , as @xmath19 decreases the domination of phantom occurs at greater values of @xmath18 .",
    "thirdly , @xmath19 is constrained such that in dust dominated era @xmath18 has to be less than one for a decelerated universe .",
    "finally , we investigate the effective fluid interaction in the model .",
    "we find an expression for the effective eos parameter , @xmath97 , as a function of @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath0 .",
    "the behaviour of the bd parameter , @xmath0 , as a function of @xmath19 in different epoch of the universe expansion is given .",
    "it has been found that @xmath0 is inversely ( negatively ) proportional to @xmath19 in radiation and matter dominated era , whereas inversely ( positively ) proportional to @xmath19 in inflation and dark energy dominated era .",
    "for the constant scalar field the effective eos parameter turns out to be the one expected in standard cosmology ."
