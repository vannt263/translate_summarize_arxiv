    "figure 9 shows the temperature dependence of @xmath149 .",
    "we evaluate @xmath153 and find @xmath156 if we fix the @xmath157 to 140 mev , then , @xmath158 turns out to be @xmath159 mev . the temperature dependence of @xmath160 and @xmath161 is shown in fig .",
    "figure 11 shows the chemical potential dependence of the effective potential at @xmath3 for @xmath131 mev . in the chiral limit ,",
    "the critical chemical potential is @xmath163 mev .",
    "we note that , in @xmath131 mev case , another extremum appears for relatively larger value of @xmath5 .",
    "figure 12 shows the @xmath5 dependence of @xmath72 .",
    "the quark condensate discontinuously vanishes at @xmath164 in the chiral limit , indicating the first order phase transition . in @xmath131 mev case ,",
    "@xmath72 changes discontinuously at @xmath165 , a little larger value than @xmath166 .",
    "however , because of finite quark mass , it does not vanish for @xmath167 .",
    "it is widely expected that as @xmath100 , namely the external field , grows the discontinuity weakens or disappears .",
    "we examined up to @xmath168 mev , however , the discontinuity does not vanish .",
    "figure 13 shows the @xmath5 dependence of @xmath72 for several temperatures .",
    "we expect that there is the critical end point @xmath170 , where the discontinuous jump of the order parameter ends in the @xmath4-@xmath5 plane .",
    "apparently its position is @xmath171 though it is not easy to determine accurately .",
    "the physics near the critical end point is interesting in the light of relativistic heavy - ion collision experiments @xcite .",
    "this , however , is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "the primary purpose of this paper was to study the current quark mass effects on chiral phase transition of qcd in the improved ladder approximation .",
    "we made use of the cjt effective potential because the use of the sde only is not adequate for studying the phase transition , and moreover , it was known that , in studies of the sde , there is a difficulty in removing the perturbative contribution from the quark condensate @xcite .    to begin with , we modified the form of the cjt effective potential using the two representations of the sde .",
    "we then studied the @xmath89 and @xmath100 dependence of the order parameter and obtained the reasonable results .",
    "being motivated by ref .",
    "@xcite , the critical number of massless flavors was also studied .",
    "our result is consistent with lattice qcd results for relatively small @xmath89 .",
    "incidentally , our formulation of the effective potential is entirely based on the higashijima - miransky approximation .",
    "however it was known that the chiral ward - takahashi identity is broken unless gluon momentum squared is used as the argument of the running coupling @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to formulate the effective potential for the finite current quark mass independently of the higashijima - miransky approximation .",
    "we then extended the effective potential to finite temperature and density by introducing the functions @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "we calculated the effective potential numerically and investigated current quark mass effects on the chiral phase structure . in either @xmath172 , @xmath1 or @xmath3 , @xmath173 case , the behavior of the order parameter in low-@xmath4 or low-@xmath5 region does not suffer the effects of finite , however small enough , current quark mass . on the other hand , in high-@xmath4 or high-@xmath5 region its behavior",
    "is perfectly dominated by the current quark mass .",
    "we also examined numerically the critical exponents @xmath105 , @xmath136 and @xmath137 and confirmed the landau theory of the second - order phase transition .",
    "the temperature dependence of the mass ratio @xmath149 was also studied .",
    "we found that for @xmath174 the mass ratio becomes smaller than two . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the temperature @xmath153 has been obtained and our results are almost coincident with theirs .",
    "we note that the similar temperature dependence of the mass ratio have been also obtained from the nambu  jona - lasinio model @xcite and the linear sigma model @xcite . in the previous paper @xcite ,",
    "in the chiral limit , we found the tricritical point at @xmath175 mev , @xmath176 mev .",
    "we found , in @xmath131 mev case , the position of the critical end point is @xmath177 mev , @xmath178 mev .    finally , some comments are in order .",
    "the treatment of the quark and gluon propagator at finite temperature and density is somewhat oversimplified in the present work . in the future , we would like to consider the wave function renormalization and more appropriate functional form for @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath112 which would depend on @xmath4 and @xmath5 explicitly . in particular , we should take into account the screening of the gluon in @xmath112 , that is to say , the effects of the debye ( electric ) mass and the nonperturbative magnetic mass , which arises from the dimensional reduction , @xmath179 at @xmath172 @xcite .",
    "they may affect the precise location of the critical line .",
    "we also note that these screening masses are probably related to the infrared regularization parameter @xmath76 , though it is not easy to show it explicitly .",
    "furthermore , it is well known that gauge covariance is lost , namely the ward - takahashi identity for the fermion  gauge - boson vertex is not satisfied when one uses the ladder approximation .",
    "of course , gauge invariance in the case of the non - abelian gauge theory is ensured by the slavnov - taylor identity which , in covariant gauges , includes a contribution connected with the faddeev - popov ghost fields .",
    "thus , addressing ourselves to gauge covariance in qcd is difficult , however , progress has been made with the abelian gauge theory @xcite .",
    "although we suppose that results of the analysis will be essentially unchanged , it is preferable to use the correct form of the fermion  gauge - boson vertex . as concerns the phase structure , it is interesting to study the physics near the critical end point , for example , critical slowing down @xcite .",
    "we also plan to study the quark pairing including a color superconductivity and a `` color - flavor locking '' @xcite ( for @xmath180 case ) .            using eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : sigma ] ) and ( [ eqn : pi ] ) , we obtain @xmath181\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\delta^{(1)},\\label{eqn : a1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the imaginary part of @xmath182 is odd function of @xmath115 ; therefore it has been removed from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : a1 ] ) and @xmath183 moreover , in order to remove the divergence , we introduce @xmath184 the term independent of @xmath44 and @xmath185 .    in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : vcjt2 ] ) , we carry out the momentum differentiation and , then , use the eqs .",
