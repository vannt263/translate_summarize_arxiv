    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ? * ) is producing the largest dataset of spectroscopically confirmed quasars to date , with the goal of obtaining @xmath14 unique quasar spectra by survey end .",
    "it is necessary to understand the survey selection function , including the completeness , in order to use the dataset for statistical purposes .",
    "for example , an accurate measure of the quasar luminosity function is dependent on the knowledge of the quasar distribution in the color space from which the quasars were selected .",
    "public releases of the quasar dataset @xcite have so far not been accompanied by a detailed description of the selection function , nor of an estimate of the completeness .",
    "that is because the first two published quasar catalogs did not use the exact final sdss quasar target selection algorithm described by @xcite .",
    "the goal of the current study is to quantify the global completeness of the finalized algorithm , which has been used since the fall of 2002 , and will be used for the remainder of the survey .",
    "given the high precision of the five - band sdss imaging photometry , the design of the filters to optimally distinguish between stars and quasars , and inclusion of optical source matching with the first radio source catalog @xcite , the completeness of the sdss quasar survey has been expected to be very high .",
    "preliminary estimates of the quasar completeness have come from comparison of radio selected and optical color selected quasar samples in the same regions of the sky @xcite . assuming that quasars with detectable radio emission are distributed in optical color space the same way as is the quasar population in general , the radio comparison shows that the completeness is likely to exceed @xmath15 .",
    "this result is consistent with the estimates given by @xcite , who used comparisons to previously identified quasars and simulated spectra to conclude that the completeness should exceed @xmath16 .",
    "the quasars missed by the sdss algorithm were lost due mainly to image defects and unresolved blends with other objects .",
    "these analyses are not definitive , however , because the region of color space containing the vast majority of stars  the stellar locus  has not been systematically searched for quasars .    in order to provide an empirical calibration of the completeness of the sdss spectroscopic targeting algorithms ,",
    "we have undertaken a spectroscopic survey of point sources to a dereddened @xmath17 magnitude of 19.1 .",
    "this flux level corresponds to the magnitude limit of the `` low - redshift '' sdss quasar survey ( the @xmath18 selected quasars which are mostly located at redshifts less than 3.0 ; see @xcite ) .",
    "spectra have been obtained for nearly @xmath19 objects that were not targeted by any of the sdss selection algorithms . in this paper",
    "the data set is examined to measure the completeness of the sdss quasar survey .",
    "the stellar content of the completeness survey will be addressed in future papers .",
    "section[observations ] describes the spectroscopic survey .",
    "the completeness of the sdss quasar survey at all stages from imaging to identified spectra are determined in  [ completeness ] , and the global survey completeness and quasar surface density are calculated .",
    "a discussion of the quasar population not targeted by the sdss is given in ",
    "[ discussion ] .",
    "the sdss is a project to image of order @xmath20 of sky mainly in the northern galactic cap , in five broad photometric bands ( @xmath21 ) to a depth of @xmath22 , and to obtain spectra of @xmath23 galaxies and @xmath24 quasars selected from the imaging survey @xcite .",
    "imaging observations are made with a dedicated 2.5 m telescope at apache point observatory in new mexico , using a large mosaic ccd camera @xcite in a drift - scanning mode .",
    "absolute astrometry for point sources is accurate to better than @xmath25 milliarcseconds rms per coordinate @xcite .",
    "site photometricity and extinction monitoring are carried out simultaneously with a dedicated 20-inch telescope at the observing site @xcite .",
    "the imaging data are reduced and calibrated using the photo software pipeline @xcite . in this study",
    "we use the point - spread function ( psf ) magnitudes , which are determined by convolving the reduced imaging data with a model of the spatial point - spread function .",
    "the sdss photometric system is normalized so that the @xmath21 magnitudes are approximately on the ab system ( oke & gunn 1983 ; fukugita et al .  1996 ; smith et al .  2002 ; c.f.discussion by abazajian et al .",
    "the photometric zeropoint calibration is accurate to better than @xmath26 ( root - mean - squared ) in the @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath17 bands , and to better than @xmath29 in the @xmath30 and @xmath31 bands , measured by comparing the photometry of objects in scan overlap regions . throughout this paper",
    "we use magnitudes corrected for galactic extinction according to @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic targets are selected by a series of algorithms ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and are grouped by three degree diameter areas or `` tiles '' @xcite .",
    "two fiber - fed double spectrographs can obtain 640 spectra for each tile ; for the main survey each tile contains 32 sky fibers , and roughly 500 galaxies , 50 quasars , and 50 stars .",
    "quasar candidates are selected from the sdss color space and unresolved matches to sources in the first radio catalog @xcite , as described by @xcite .",
    "these are the only two categories of quasar candidates which are specifically targeted for spectroscopic observations in the sdss , and the only two we consider for measuring the quasar survey completeness .",
    "spectra of quasars are often obtained because the objects were targeted for spectroscopy by non - quasar selection algorithms , such as optical matches to rosat sources @xcite , various classes of stars @xcite , or so - called serendipity ( serendip ) objects @xcite .",
    "however , those objects are assigned spectroscopic fibers only if fibers are available after all candidate quasars , galaxies , sky positions , and calibration stars corresponding to a given tile have first been assigned fibers .",
    "the contribution of additional quasars from non - quasar selection algorithms is discussed in ",
    "[ discussion ] .",
    "objects in the imaging data must first pass a series of image quality tests .",
    "then the colors of the objects are compared to a parameterization of the stellar locus , convolved with the uncertainties of the colors of the object ; objects with colors outside of the stellar locus region are considered quasar candidates .",
    "low - redshift ( @xmath32 ) `` uv excess '' quasars are selected from the @xmath18 color cube , while high - redshift quasars are selected from the @xmath33 color cube . as discussed by @xcite , there are additionally some regions of color space inside the stellar locus from which quasar candidates are explicitly included , and regions outside the locus for which candidates are excluded .",
    "specifically , objects are rejected if they lie inside the regions typically dominated by white dwarfs , a stars , or m star - white dwarf pairs .",
    "objects are included if they lie in the color space expected for quasars with redshifts between @xmath34 and @xmath35 , which is where the `` quasar locus '' crosses the stellar locus .",
    "three additional sets of color cuts are used to improve the selection of high - redshift ( @xmath36 ) quasars .",
    "finally , a simple uv - excess cut is implemented for more direct comparison with many previous quasar surveys .",
    "all of the color regions and cuts are given explicitly by @xcite .",
    "the limiting dereddened magnitude of the survey is @xmath0 for @xmath18 selected ( typically low - redshift ) and radio matched quasar candidates .",
    "high - redshift quasar candidates are targeted up to @xmath37 , but we consider only those high - redshift candidates with magnitudes brighter than @xmath38 for this study . a bright limit of @xmath39 ( uncorrected for galactic extinction ) is also imposed to avoid saturation and crosstalk in the spectroscopic data .      to test the performance of the quasar ( and other ) sdss target selection algorithms , a program was undertaken to identify unresolved sources which were not selected for spectroscopic observations in the normal course of the survey .",
    "the resulting set of identified objects can be used to determine the fraction of quasars and other objects `` missed '' by the main survey , and to determine from their spectral properties why they were not selected .",
    "the completeness survey is focused on a section of sdss stripe number 82 @xcite , which is centered on the celestial equator , and extends from @xmath40 to @xmath41 with a width of just over @xmath42 ; the area of this region is @xmath43 .",
    "the imaging and spectroscopic observations of stripe 82 are made in the fall months when the unobserved regions of the main survey area are not accessible .",
    "all of the imaging runs from which the sources have been selected for spectroscopic observations are included in the sdss second and third data releases @xcite .",
    "the imaging run numbers are : 2583 , 2659 , 2662 , 2738 , 3325 , and 3388 .",
    "they are the imaging runs covering the survey area that had the highest quality at the start of the survey , ensuring that the selection algorithms would operate under the best available conditions . for the purposes of the quasar completeness survey ,",
    "the sky area is also ideal because it has a high _ spectroscopic _ completeness ( the fraction of main sample quasar candidates with spectroscopic identifications ) .",
    "the sample of quasar candidates selected by the algorithm described by @xcite from among the objects in the imaging data used for this survey , differs from the sample targeted for spectroscopy by the sdss in the same sky area .",
    "there are two primary reasons for this .",
    "first , the sdss spectroscopic targets were selected by an earlier version of the quasar algorithm .",
    "most notably , there are now more high-@xmath31 candidates  those selected by their location in the @xmath33 color cube @xcite  which also causes the set of unobserved targets to be dominated by high-@xmath31 candidates .",
    "second , variations in object brightness , due to measurement uncertainty as well as real variability , cause the population of quasars to change slightly from one imaging run to the next .",
    "studies of the variability of sdss quasars show that the @xmath17 band rms magnitude differences are @xmath44 on the timescale of a year @xcite ; this can cause some quasars to either make or miss the magnitude limit from one run to the next .",
    "however , over @xmath16 of the quasar candidates selected for this program by the final algorithm were previously selected in other runs covering the same area of sky using an earlier version of the algorithm .    the goal of this program is to measure the angular density of quasars on the sky which are missed by the final selection algorithm .",
    "this is accomplished by spectroscopically identifying objects selected from all regions of color space .",
    "the potential targets for this program were selected as unresolved ( point ) sources , identified by the photo pipeline , in order to avoid targeting an excessive number of galaxies .",
    "the survey completeness for quasars with extended image profiles ( mainly lower redshift active galactic nuclei ) is addressed in  [ extended ] using the main sdss galaxy sample .",
    "( for other discussions of samples of sdss active galactic nuclei with extended image profiles , see @xcite , and @xcite . )",
    "unresolved sources were selected which have magnitudes fainter than @xmath45 ( uncorrected for galactic extinction ) and brighter than dereddened @xmath46 ; these limits are adopted in order to avoid saturation at the bright end and to match the quasar survey limit at the faint end .",
    "additional constraints were imposed on the quality of the images ( e.g. bad ccd columns were avoided ) as they were for the main quasar survey , as described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "no color cuts were applied .",
    "the selection process up to this stage is identical to that used by the main sdss quasar survey before the color selection algorithm is applied , except that here only point sources were selected .",
    "the total number of objects selected as potential follow - up targets ( regardless of color ) in the completeness program area is @xmath47 .",
    "of those , 3192 were targeted as quasar candidates by the final sdss quasar algorithm ( including only color and radio matching selection ) . of the targeted quasar candidates , 2909 ( @xmath48 )",
    "have been spectroscopically observed , mostly as part of the main sdss quasar survey .",
    "some of the remaining candidates have been targeted for spectroscopy in the quasar survey , but have simply not yet been observed .",
    "other candidates have not been targeted for the spectroscopic quasar survey for reasons discussed earlier in this section . a small number of objects in the sample are quasars that were not selected by the final algorithm , but instead by other targeting algorithms such as x - ray source matching or star candidate selection ; these are discussed in  [ discussion ] .",
    "the number of objects in the program area _ not _ selected as quasar candidates is prohibitively large for a comprehensive spectroscopic survey , therefore the set of objects was sparsely sampled for spectroscopy using the criteria described next .",
    "the density of point sources is a strong function of right ascension , as shown in figure[densityplot ] ; this is not surprising given the large range in galactic latitude ( @xmath49 ) covered by the sdss stripe .",
    "there is very little change in density across the @xmath42 of declination . to provide a more uniform distribution of targets for the spectroscopic plates , the probability of selecting an object",
    "was varied inversely as the density at its right ascension .",
    "the density of point sources was fit with a fourth - order polynomial , and the selection probability was proportional to the inverse of the fit .",
    "in practice , the selection probability was set to 100 times the inverse of the point source density , and an object was selected if the decimal part of 10 times its right ascension ( in degrees ) was less than the selection probability .",
    "the sampling rate thus ranged from nearly unity at the minimum of the point source density , to as low as @xmath50 at the high density end of the stripe .",
    "a simpler parameterization of the point source density , which also provides a better fit to the data , is a modified secant function @xmath51 where the @xmath52 are constants .",
    "( this function was not used for the sparse sampling since it was first fit after the sampling was completed . ) for the entire set of non - quasar candidate point sources , the values are @xmath53deg@xmath54 , @xmath55deg@xmath54 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 ; the fit is shown in fig.[densityplot ] .",
    "the density of all sources is important for determining the density of untargeted quasars (  [ misseddensity ] ) .",
    "after sparse sampling the sources based on density , non - quasar candidate targets for spectroscopic follow - up were selected .",
    "observations were carried out in two seasons , fall 2002 and fall 2003 , and the spectroscopic targets were selected in different ways each season .",
    "first , before the fall 2002 observations , objects were selected at random from any point in color space .",
    "this is the simplest method , but may not be the most efficient method of investigating quasar completeness . in the densest parts of the stellar locus ,",
    "the ratio of stars to quasars is maximal , so it is most efficient to avoid those regions . because of the high precision of the sdss photometry , the core of the stellar locus is very narrow and fills a relatively small volume of color space ( there is no reason to expect the color distribution of quasars to mimic this stellar locus core ) .",
    "two other selection methods  used before the fall 2003 observations  were designed to sample the volume of color space outside of the core of the stellar locus more often than it would be for purely random color selection . to implement these options ,",
    "a pair of lines was fit to the stellar locus in the @xmath58 color plane , and the corresponding standard deviation of the color distance from the lines was determined .",
    "the color distances from the lines were calculated for all of the objects .",
    "those objects more than one standard deviation away from the locus fit were deemed `` outside '' of the stellar locus , and spectroscopic targets were drawn randomly from this set .",
    "objects closer than one standard deviation  defined to be `` inside '' the stellar locus  were given a priority weight roughly proportional to the distance from the locus line fits .",
    "spectroscopic targets from this sample were selected at random but weighted by the priority .",
    "the numbers of spectroscopic targets in each sample were selected to be roughly equal , which ensured that more targets outside the locus would be observed than for a strictly random color space selection .",
    "the densities of all point sources inside and outside the stellar locus core as a function of @xmath59 are shown in fig.[densityplot ] .",
    "the object selection used here is much simpler than the sdss quasar selection @xcite , and is designed only to select a large fraction of targets which are close to , but not inside , the densest parts of the stellar locus .",
    "two sets of spectroscopic plates were designed .",
    "the first set was designed before the fall 2002 observations for the objects in the completely random target selection sample .",
    "the second set was designed before the fall 2003 observations for the objects selected to be either inside or outside the core of the stellar locus .",
    "there were 41 plates observed for the randomly selected objects , and 26 for those selected by locus distance .",
    "figure[coordplot ] shows the distribution on the sky of the 67 plates used in this study .",
    "the plates cover an area of @xmath60 within the @xmath2 image stripe area .",
    "the plate areas often overlap , but different sets of objects are observed .",
    "the sparse sampling procedure described above causes the targets to be drawn from narrow ranges of @xmath59 where the stellar density is high ( see fig.[coordplot ] ) , but this has no effect on the survey .",
    "the fibers corresponding to each plate configuration were shared with other programs , but this does not affect the results here ; about @xmath61 of the available science fibers were allocated to the completeness program . in total , 12494 randomly selected targets were observed spectroscopically , while 3946 targets inside , and 3090 outside the stellar locus were observed .",
    "spectroscopic observations and data processing were performed in the same manner as is done for the main sdss survey @xcite .",
    "the reduced and calibrated spectra of the 19530 objects were given preliminary identifications by the spectro1d pipeline .",
    "the pipeline identifications and measurements are not perfect , however , and often fail when the spectra have unusual properties , such as may be the case for a significant number of the quasars found in a survey like this one .",
    "therefore , the spectra of all 19530 observed objects were manually inspected by one author , and those with unusual or ambiguous identifications were inspected by at least five other authors .    in the entire spectroscopic sample ,",
    "only ten objects were identified as quasars ( all but one were correctly identified by the spectro1d pipeline ) . of these ,",
    "six were found among the randomly selected targets , four were from the sample outside the stellar locus , and none were found from the sample inside the stellar locus .",
    "four have redshifts between 2.7 and 3.0 .",
    "the fact that so few quasars were found among objects not selected as quasar candidates suggests that the selection completeness is high ; the completeness will be quantified in the next section .",
    "the spectra of the ten quasars are shown in fig.[specplot ] , and table[tab1 ] gives a summary of their properties .",
    "all of the quasars are newly discovered by this program .",
    "color - color and color - magnitude diagrams for all of the observed objects are shown in fig.[colorcolorplot ] , with the quasar locations highlighted .",
    "the colors of the ten quasars as a function of redshift , in comparison with the median color vs.  redshift curves for the 2191 quasars in the area selected using the final sdss algorithm , are shown in fig.[zcolorplot ] .",
    "a discussion of each of the quasars is given in ",
    "[ notes ] .",
    "we first discuss why the quasars found in the completeness survey were not targeted by the sdss quasar algorithm .",
    "next , we measure the densities on the sky of targeted and missed quasars , and use these results to determine the completeness of the quasar selection algorithm .",
    "incompleteness due to image defects and unidentifiable spectra are also discussed , and an estimate of the completeness for extended sources is also made .",
    "finally , the end - to - end completeness of the of the sdss quasar survey is calculated , along with the corresponding estimate of the true density of quasars to the limiting magnitude .",
    "the reasons each of the quasars in the completeness survey were missed by the sdss quasar selection algorithm are given here .",
    "no quasar was rejected because it is located in the white dwarf , a star , or white dwarf + m star `` exclusion boxes ''  regions of color space outside the core of the stellar locus , in which the density of certain types of stars would cause a significant drop in quasar selection efficiency @xcite .",
    "all of the quasars have colors consistent with the stellar locus in the @xmath18 color cube .",

    "there is no indication from the spectrum that the quasar is unusual in any other way , except perhaps that the mgii emission line is relatively narrow",
    ".      the completeness of the quasar selection algorithm can be determined by comparing the density on the sky of quasars which are and are not targeted as quasar candidates .",
    "the density of targeted quasars is simply the number of such quasars which are spectroscopically verified , divided by the area of sky from which they were discovered , corrected for the number of quasars expected among the candidates which were not spectroscopically observed .    in the imaging data of the completeness program survey area , there are 3192 objects targeted by the final sdss quasar algorithm as candidates . of these ,",

    "this overall efficiency could be used directly to estimate the number of quasars expected among the remaining 280 unobserved candidates .",
    "however , the efficiency is a strong function of apparent magnitude , and depends upon the type of candidate ( high-@xmath31 or low-@xmath31 ) .",
    "we must account for possible differences in the distribution of types of candidates and the magnitude distributions of the observed and unobserved samples .",

    "color - color and color - magnitude diagrams of the 80 galaxy - selected quasars missed by the quasar algorithm are shown in fig.[cccmgal ] .",

    "<S> spectra of nearly 20000 point - like objects to a galactic reddening corrected magnitude of @xmath0 have been obtained to test the completeness of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) quasar survey . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on spatially unresolved quasars , which comprise @xmath1 of all sdss quasars to the main survey magnitude limit . </S>",
    "<S> the objects were selected from all regions of color space , sparsely sampled from within a @xmath2 area ( effective area @xmath3 ) of sky covered by this study . </S>",
    "<S> only ten quasars were identified that were not targeted as candidates by the sdss quasar survey ( including both color and radio source selection ) . </S>",
    "<S> the inferred density of unresolved quasars on the sky that are missed by the sdss algorithm is @xmath4 , compared to @xmath5 for the selected quasar density , giving a completeness of @xmath6 to the limiting magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> omitting radio selection reduces the color - only selection completeness by about @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> of the ten newly identified quasars , three have detected broad absorption line systems , six are significantly redder than other quasars at the same redshift , and four have redshifts between 2.7 and 3.0 ( the redshift range where the sdss colors of quasars intersect the stellar locus ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fraction of quasars ( and other unresolved sources ) missed due to image defects and blends , independent of the selection algorithm , is @xmath8 , but this number varies by a few percent with magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> quasars with extended images comprise about @xmath9 of the sdss sample , and the completeness of the selection algorithm for extended quasars is approximately @xmath10 , based on the sdss galaxy survey </S>",
    "<S> . the combined end - to - end completeness for the sdss quasar survey is @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the total corrected density of quasars on the sky to @xmath0 is estimated to be @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the sdss completeness restricted to @xmath13 quasars is expected to be considerably lower , and is a strong function of redshift . </S>",
    "<S> the determination of the global completeness is required for the statistical properties of quasars to @xmath0 derived from the sdss dataset , such as the luminosity function and correlation function , to be accurately determined . </S>"
