    "in sect.[small ] , we will discuss the second order phase transition in small dynamical quark mass in vacuum , or equivalently , in large momentum cutoff , and in sect.[large ] expound the second and the first order phase transition in larger ratio of the above two parameters .",

    "<S> a general research on chiral symmetry restoring phase transitions at zero temperature and finite chemical potentials under electrical neutrality condition has been conducted in a nambu - jona - lasinio model to describe two - flavor normal quark matter . </S>",
    "<S> depending on that @xmath0 , the ratio of dynamical quark mass in vacuum and the 3d momentum cutoff in the loop integrals , is less or greater than 0.413 , the phase transition will be second or first order . a complete phase diagram of @xmath1 quark chemical potential versus @xmath2 is given . with the electrical neutrality constraint </S>",
    "<S> , the region where second order phase transition happens will be wider than the one without electrical neutrality limitation . </S>",
    "<S> the results also show that , for the value of @xmath0 from qcd phenomenology , the phase transition must be first order . </S>"
