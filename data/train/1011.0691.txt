    "millimeter - wavelength continuum surveys of the galactic plane provide the most efficient way to find molecular clumps that are the likely formation sites of massive stars and star clusters .",
    "the development of detector arrays has made blind surveys of large areas possible .",
    "such surveys bypass the need for selection based on the presence of embedded stars or star clusters , infrared sources , masers , or radio continuum emission .",
    "in particular , they can locate molecular clumps before stars form , providing vital information on the initial conditions of star formation .",
    "these surveys can also provide valuable constraints on the physical properties of the clumps , especially masses and mean densities , when combined with distance information .",
    "galaxy - wide surveys are essential for measuring the impacts of the environment on clump properties and star formation activity .",
    "do clump properties vary with galactocentric distance , or with location with respect to spiral arms ?",
    "do they depend on the level of nearby star formation activity ? answering these questions in our galaxy will provide the essential `` ground truth '' required for the analysis of distant galaxies where individual clouds and clumps are not resolved and only galaxy - wide average quantities can be measured .",
    "surveys of the galaxy in low - lying rotational transitions of the co molecule @xcite have identified the locations of large molecular clouds and traced the transition from atomic gas in the outer galaxy to molecular gas in the inner galaxy .",
    "surveys in co have detected a strong preference for gmcs to form along spiral arms @xcite .",
    "recent improved measurements of kinematic distances ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and accurate distances from vlbi @xcite have refined our view of the spiral structure of the milky way .",
    "this new increase in data now allows a more complete investigation of the relationship between spiral density waves and star formation .",
    "locating the early stages of star formation is quite difficult , and often relies on the serendipitous location of a cold , dark cloud which appears as an irdc .",
    "while dark clouds were known from optically obscured regions , the `` discovery '' of irdcs from the msx ( mid - course space experiment ) satellite was presented by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "irdcs have now been extensively cataloged with msx @xcite and glimpse 8 @xmath14  data @xcite . in the past decade , compelling evidence has emerged which suggests that irdcs are the pre - cursors to massive stars , and therefore , stellar clusters ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "irdcs , however , require the favorable viewing condition of being in front of a bright , mid - ir background for detection .",
    "millimeter wave surveys , however , provide an efficient means of identifying cold , dense dust throughout the galaxy independent of the galactic background , and thus may be seen at large distances .",
    "moreover , the millimeter - wave emission is optically thin , allowing the properties of the cloud to be determined .",
    "millimeter wave surveys such as bgps are essential for understanding massive star and cluster formation on a galactic scale , from the inner to the outer galaxy .",
    "studies of nearby clouds have demonstrated that star formation is far from uniform over molecular clouds , but is concentrated in unusually dense regions called clumps or cores , which fill a small fraction of the area of most clouds @xcite .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , we use the term ` core ' to refer to a very dense region destined to form an individual star or small multiple star system and the term ` clump ' to refer to a region likely to form a group or cluster of stars .",
    "while clumps forming massive clusters may be even denser than cores forming low mass stars @xcite , in general , clumps are larger and have a lower mean density @xcite .    to delineate clumps from their parent clouds as traced in co , line emission from molecules which are high - density tracers , such as , h@xmath15co , cs , hcn , etc .",
    "are extremely useful .",
    "spectral lines also provide excellent diagnostics of line - of - sight motions , temperatures , and densities .",
    "however , the interpretation of these gas tracers is complicated by variations in tracer abundances caused by freeze - out onto grains , sublimation caused by star formation , and subsequent complex chemical processing @xcite .",
    "interpretation is further complicated by uncertainties in optical depths and excitation conditions and the impacts of radiation fields and shocks .",
    "these complications make the derivation from such molecular line data of column densities , masses , and other physical properties of star - forming clumps very difficult .",
    "a further limitation of spectral line surveys is that the tracers of denser gas tend to be weak , and multi - element receiver arrays have only a modest number of elements , making blind surveys very time - consuming .",
    "instruments are beginning to be developed to address this limitation , such as nrao s k - band focal plane array and jcmt s harp - b @xcite .",
    "in contrast , focal - plane arrays containing hundreds of individual bolometers sensitive to millimeter and sub - millimeter ( sub - mm ) radiation are now available .",
    "this advance in technology enables blind surveys of the galactic plane , providing a uniform inventory of massive star - forming and starless clumps .",
    "catalogs resulting from these surveys will provide the data base for subsequent observations in tracers such as hard - to - excite molecular lines and higher resolution studies with instruments like carma and alma .",
    "a significant advantage of continuum observations of dust at long wavelengths is the low optical depth of the dust @xcite , permitting a straight - forward estimate of the mass of the emitting region .",
    "submillimeter observations of galactic sources have been conducted by a variety of different groups focusing on small regions .",
    "the submillimeter common - user bolometer array ( scuba ; @xcite ) on the 15-m james clerk maxwell telescope mapped many significant regions in the galactic plane over its 8 year lifetime ( see @xcite for a summary ) , but never completed a contiguous survey of the galactic plane .",
    "the bolocam instrument has been used on the 10.4-m caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) to map nearby large molecular clouds at 1.1 mm and identify hundreds of cores @xcite .",
    "mambo on the 30-m iram telescope has been used at 1.2 mm to map both small , nearby cores @xcite and more distant regions of more massive star formation @xcite .",
    "none of these surveys covered a significant fraction of the galactic plane .",
    "this situation has begun to change dramatically .",
    "recent wide - area surveys have been carried out in the submillimeter bands 250 @xmath14  - 500 @xmath14  by the balloon - borne large aperture submillimeter telescope ( blast ) @xcite .",
    "this work provides an unprecedented view of a wide range of star forming environments and demonstrates the richness of submillimeter datasets , creating great anticipation for the imminent results from instruments aboard _",
    ", particularly the spire camera . from the ground , the atlasgal survey @xcite , using the laboca instrument at 870  with 192 resolution on the apex telescope in chile , has covered 95 square degrees in the galactic plane , @xmath16 and @xmath17 with @xmath18",
    ". the survey will eventually encompass @xmath19 with @xmath20 .",
    "the bgps is the first millimeter survey of a substantial fraction of the galactic plane in the northern hemisphere .",
    "the bgps maps in the first quadrant overlap with the vla galactic plane survey ( vgps ) in hi and radio continuum @xcite , the _ spitzer_-glimpse and glimpse - ii fields @xcite , mipsgal @xcite , the bu - fcrao @xmath21co @xmath22 galactic ring survey @xcite , and atlasgal @xcite , among others .",
    "the bgps coverage will also overlap with the upcoming _ herschel _ higal @xcite and scuba-2/jcmt plane surveys @xcite .",
    "the provides a long - wavelength dust continuum data point , complementing the spectral energy distribution provided by other surveys . by covering the both the galactic center and anti - center regions with a single instrument",
    ", a consistent comparison over the widest possible range of galactocentric radius is possible .",
    "the bgps gives a view of massive star and cluster formation throughout the galaxy , and provides an important finder chart for future high - resolution observations with facilities such as carma and alma .",
    "this paper presents the imaging data from the bolocam galactic plane survey ( bgps ) .",
    "the source catalog is described in a companion paper ( @xcite ; hereafter r10 ) .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "section [ sec : observations ] describes the instrument and the observations .",
    "the data analysis is described in sections [ sec : astrometry ] ( astrometry ) , [ sec : mapping ] ( the map - making algorithm ) , and [ sec : calibration ] ( flux calibration ) .",
    "key discussions are in section [ sec : photometry ] , which explains the effect of the data processing on the accurate recovery of extended structure , and in section [ sec : fluxcomparison ] , which compares the bgps flux with other surveys , including a discussion of a possible systematic offset .",
    "the final image data products and the public release are described in section [ sec : finalmaps ] .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : discussion ] with a brief discussion of the broad features of the bgps in comparison with other surveys .",
    "we used bolocam to survey more than 170  square degrees of the northern galactic plane .",
    "bolocam is the facility 144-element bolometer array camera mounted at the cassegrain focus of the 10.4-m mirror of the cso on the summit of mauna kea .",
    "we used the filter configuration with a band center of 271.1  ghz ( hereafter 1.1  mm ) and fractional bandwidth @xmath23 ( 46 ghz ) .",
    "the detectors are silicon nitride micromesh absorbers with ntd germanium thermistors , operated at a temperature of @xmath24250 mk .",
    "the bolocam array field - of - view is 75 , with individual detectors having nearly gaussian beams of 31  fwhm .",
    "the spacing between the individual detector beams on the sky is 38 , so the focal plane is not instantaneously fully sampled .",
    "the bolocam instrument is described in greater detail in @xcite .",
    "the maps presented here were acquired during six separate observing sessions at the cso over the course of two years between june 2005 and september 2007 .",
    "the observing epochs are given in table [ tab : observing ] .",
    "bolocam observations were typically scheduled when @xmath25 . between observing epochs ,",
    "bolocam was removed from its mount at the re - imaged cassegrain focus and stored warm .",
    "thus the flux calibration and pointing model were re - computed for each epoch to allow for variations in the instrument and optics .",
    "the final data products were aligned to the well - constrained pointing model created from the epoch v and vi data ( section [ sec : astrometry ] ) .",
    "we found that the flux calibration did not in fact differ significantly between epochs ; see section [ sec : fluxcalibration ] for more details .",
    "figure [ fig : coverage ] shows the coverage of the .",
    "the survey is contiguous over the range @xmath26 . towards the cygnus x spiral arm , the coverage",
    "was flared to @xmath20 for @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , cross - cuts to @xmath27 were made at @xmath28 and 31 .",
    "the total area of this section is 133 square degrees . with the exception of the increase in latitude ,",
    "no pre - selection criteria were applied to the coverage in this region .",
    "in addition to the contiguous region , four targeted regions in the outer galaxy were observed : ic1396 ( 9 square degrees , @xmath5 , @xmath29 ) , a region towards the perseus arm ( 4 square degrees centered on @xmath7 , @xmath8 near ngc7538 ) , w3/4/5 ( 18 square degrees , @xmath30 ) and gem ob1 ( 6 square degrees , @xmath10 ) .",
    "the total area of good coverage for the bgps is 170  square degrees .",
    "our basic observing strategy was to raster scan a field by moving the primary mirror of the cso .",
    "this was done to modulate the astrophysical signal faster than fluctuations in atmospheric opacity .",
    "each field was scanned in a pattern with alternating rasters along lines of constant @xmath31 , followed by a series of rasters along lines of constant @xmath32 .",
    "fields were observed several times with such raster scans to improve signal - to - noise ( s / n ) .",
    "thus each point in the final map of a field was observed multiple times with the array moving in different directions with respect to the astrophysical emission , helping to separate it from atmospheric emission ( see section [ sec : mapping ] for further details on this process ) .    in epochs i and ii , the fundamental observing block was a region @xmath33 , covered by 23 rasters along each of @xmath31or @xmath32 . starting with epoch iii , the fundamental block",
    "was changed to @xmath34 for increased mapping efficiency ( i.e. , less time spent in turnarounds at the end of a raster ) .",
    "each @xmath34 block was covered using either 23 rasters along lines of constant @xmath32 , or 67 rasters along lines of constant @xmath31 . in both cases ,",
    "the spacing between adjacent rasters was 162 .",
    "the total time for observing the entire block was 39 ( 48 ) minutes for rasters along constant @xmath32 ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the data were electronically sampled at 10 hz along the scan direction , slightly higher than the nyquist rate for the scan speed of 120s@xmath12 .",
    "these fundamental observing blocks were stitched together to make 29 large , contiguous maps .",
    "these images define the `` fields '' used for comparison .",
    "each `` field '' includes all observations covering a region between 1 and 6 square degrees .",
    "because the bolocam detector beams do not fully overlap on the sky , if the array is scanned along detector rows , gaps will be left in the resulting map . to ameliorate this",
    ", we began using in epoch ii a field rotator to adjust the rotation angle of the array with respect to the scan direction so that as the scan proceeded the full extent of the fov in the direction orthogonal to the scan was sampled by at least one detector .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig : array ] . achieving a uniform sampling along the scan - orthogonal direction",
    "is further complicated by a number of missing bolometers .",
    "a simulation was performed to determine the optimal angle to rotate the array with respect to the scan direction to account for both the effects of the beam spacing and missing bolometers . during the turnaround following a raster , the field rotator",
    "is adjusted to this optimum angle for the subsequent raster . without the field rotator",
    ", the coverage shows variations of 100% from pixel to pixel in a single raster of a field . with the rotator ,",
    "this is reduced to @xmath35 .",
    "we constructed an absolute reference system for the bgps by observing bright quasars and blazars near the galactic plane with small raster maps .",
    "the sources were chosen from the sma submillimeter calibrator list , since they have positions reliably determined from interferometric measurements and are point sources at the scale of the bolocam beam .",
    "the distribution of absolute pointing sources over the sky is shown in figure [ fig : pointingcalibrators ] .",
    "pointing observations were performed approximately once every two hours over each night .",
    "the elevation offsets showed a deviation from zero which was empirically well - modeled by a quadratic function of altitude .",
    "no systematic deviation was observed for the azimuth offsets .",
    "the derived model is shown in figure [ fig : pointingmodel ] .",
    "an rms scatter of @xmath36 for the model over the entire observed range was achieved , with somewhat worse scatter in altitude than in azimuth .",
    "in addition to the model for the pointing center , it is necessary to empirically determine the actual projected pattern of the array on the sky , and measure the rotation angle between the focal plane and the sky coordinate system .",
    "this is done by making observations which track all detectors across a bright source ( e.g. a planet ) and making maps from each bolometer individually .    in our first data",
    "release , the projected positions of the detectors on the sky are made using the nominal positions without correction for optical distortion .",
    "this results in a slightly reduced effective resolution ( 33  instead of 31 ) .",
    "the effective beam size was measured from fully - sampled beam - mapping observations of planets , and is a good description of the blurring of the beam for the portions of a field observed by all the detectors . within about one fov of the field edges",
    ", however , only a subset of the array observes the field , and so the effective beam size varies slightly at these positions , and may be asymmetric .",
    "because this distortion is asymmetric , it can also result in a small pointing offset .",
    "however , this effect is strongly mitigated by the low number of hits at field edges : this data is generally flagged out .",
    "the residual offset is found to be within the overall pointing model error , but caution should be used when measuring source locations at the field edges in the first data release .",
    "future releases will have the distortion correction applied , removing this effect and improving the effective resolution .",
    "a master pointing field was constructed from observations taken in the epoch with the best - constrained pointing model for that field ( either epoch v or vi ) for every field observed by the .",
    "relative alignment between the master and other observations of the same field was performed by finding the peak of the cross - correlation between images .",
    "the cross - correlation peak was fit with a gaussian profile and the difference between the gaussian peak and the image center was used as the pointing offset .",
    "the offset may be determined accurately to within the error in finding the peak of the gaussian , typically @xmath37 . to create the final image , all observations of a field",
    "were merged into a single timestream with these pointing offsets applied .",
    "this method of alignment makes use of all the information available in the maps , and avoids the ambiguities inherent in using extracted sources to align fields , as the bgps sources are rarely point - like .",
    "it further avoids the slightly larger effective beam and loss of peak flux density which would result if the maps of individual observations were combined using the pointing model alone , where each individual observation would be co - added with the 6  rms uncertainty of the model . in some fields with few sources , particularly those in the range @xmath31=65",
    "to 75 , there was not enough signal to acquire a pointing offset using cross - correlation . in these fields ,",
    "the pointing model was used directly , and so the above mentioned effects affect these fields .      all scuba 850 and 450 @xmath14  data has been re - processed in a uniform manner and made publicly available as the scuba legacy catalog ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter slc ) .",
    "these maps allow a cross - check of the accuracy of the bgps pointing model .",
    "we have applied the same cross - correlation procedure used to obtain the relative alignment of bgps observations to compare the bgps to the slc 850 @xmath14  images . @xcite claim a typical pointing accuracy for scuba of @xmath38 , with offsets as large as @xmath39 occurring occasionally .",
    "no further adjustment to the nominal jcmt pointing model was performed in producing the slc maps , and thus we assume these numbers are typical .",
    "there are a number of differences in the bolocam and slc maps which might lead to difficulties in comparing their astrometry .",
    "in particular , different scan strategies were used ( scuba observations were typically taken in jiggle - map mode , which tends to remove extended structure ) , and of course there is the difference in wavelength and beam size between the instruments .",
    "nevertheless , the by - eye morphological comparison between slc 850 @xmath14  and bgps sources is generally excellent , as exemplified in figure [ fig : scubapointingcomparison - a ] .",
    "a cross - correlation technique was used in order to minimize these limitations , since it does not require the establishment of a single position for an object .",
    "the slc has the advantage of having observations over a large portion of the plane , allowing the pointing to be checked ( in spots ) for deviations as a function of position . to test this ,",
    "21 of the 29 bgps fields were used which overlapped with the slc . for these fields , we find @xmath40 , @xmath41 , nearly consistent with zero , and an rms dispersion about the mean bgps position of 62 , consistent with the errors derived for the bolocam pointing model .",
    "the offset for each field is shown in figure [ fig : scubapointingcomparison - b ] .",
    "we have _ not _ corrected the bolocam pointing based on the slc or any external data set , but have produced our final maps with the internally derived model described in section [ sec : pointingmodel ] .",
    "at wavelengths near 1 mm , the emission from the atmosphere dominates any astrophysical emission . for an atmospheric zenith optical depth of @xmath42 = 0.1 , the sky brightness temperature is around 30 to 40 kelvin at typical zenith angles .",
    "this background loading determines the instrument calibration ( see section [ sec : fluxcalibration ] ) , but the primary time - variable signal is due to few percent fluctuations in atmospheric opacity .",
    "the conversion @xmath43 from jy  beam@xmath12to kelvin for bolocam is @xmath44 where @xmath45 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath46 is the effective collecting area of the telescope .",
    "thus atmosphere fluctuations are 10 s of jy  beam@xmath12 , as compared to the typical brightness of galactic sources , which lie in the range of 0.1 - 1 jy  beam@xmath12 .",
    "the essential signal - processing problem to be solved by the mapping algorithm , then , is the estimation of the astrophysical emission in the presence of the fluctuating atmosphere signal , without _ a priori _ knowledge of either .    for this work , a custom pipeline was developed to address issues specific to the bgps . it is based on , but significantly improves , the method of @xcite for generating maps and characterizing their properties , and is similar in many respects to the methods used by other bolometer cameras , e.g. , @xcite ( mustang / gbt ) or @xcite ( sharc-2/cso ) .",
    "it also incorporates some of the technical developments of @xcite developed for bolocam data at 2.1 mm .",
    "a key element of the reduction is the iterative estimation of the atmospheric fluctuations and the astrophysical signal .",
    "the atmospheric model is developed from a set of principal components of the bolometer signal time series under the assumption that the bulk of the correlated signal is atmospheric .",
    "after subtraction of the atmosphere model , the astrophysical emission is estimated , then subtracted , and the process is repeated .",
    "we assume the raw timestream data @xmath47 for each bolometer ( indexed by @xmath48 ) at discrete time points ( indexed by @xmath49 ) can be written as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the astrophysical signal , @xmath52 is the median atmospheric fluctuation seen by all detectors , @xmath53 are terms correlated between bolometers that are distinct from @xmath52 , @xmath54 are non - random signals due to the instrument itself , @xmath55 are long timescale fluctuations not modeled by @xmath52 or @xmath53 , and @xmath56 is irreducible gaussian noise due to photon fluctuations and detector noise .",
    "( each of these terms is discussed in greater detail in the following sections . )    in the presence of purely gaussian noise , the maximum likelihood map @xmath57 can be obtained by minimizing the goodness - of - fit statistic @xmath58 here @xmath47 is the concatenated data from all bolometers ( of dimension @xmath59=number time samples of all detectors ) .",
    "@xmath60 provides the mapping between a given sample in the time - ordered data and the pixel in the sky map to which it corresponds .",
    "@xmath60 is a matrix of dimension @xmath61number of map pixels .",
    "each element of @xmath60 is either 1 or 0 .",
    "note that we are considering the data @xmath47 and the map @xmath57 as vectors ( the mapping to a two - dimensional map being implicit in the matrix @xmath60 ) .",
    "@xmath62 is an @xmath63 matrix which is the inverse of the covariance matrix @xmath64 of the time domain noise @xmath56 , @xmath65 where @xmath66 denotes an ensemble average over many realizations of the random timestream noise process @xmath67 .",
    "further detail about the way in which @xmath62 was estimated is given in section [ sec : noise ] .",
    "the result of the @xmath68 minimization is @xmath69 thus , the mapping from data to map is a linear operator , @xmath70 . for compactness ,",
    "equation [ eq : lsmap ] will be written as @xmath71 = m$ ] .",
    "note that the mapping operator is not invertible .",
    "however , given a map @xmath57 and an observing matrix @xmath60 , there exists a linear operation which makes predictions about the observed timestreams , namely @xmath72 ; this will be denoted @xmath73 = d$ ] .    because the model @xmath74 in equation [ eq : chisquared ] only includes the celestial contribution to the observed data @xmath47 , direct use of equation [ eq : lsmap ] will produce a map containing artifacts due to the unmodeled components @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 .",
    "one approach would be to include templates for these terms as additional rows in @xmath60 and proceed with a simultaneous fit .",
    "in general , however , the correct forms to use are not known _ a priori_. the goal , then , is to produce a time series for each bolometer which as closely as possible approximates @xmath75 so that we may produce the best estimate of the astrophysical signal @xmath76 = s + n$ ] .",
    "we proceed iteratively , estimating each term in equation [ eq : timedomainmodel ] in the order of its relative strength . in the following ,",
    "we denote the best estimate of a time series @xmath77 in the @xmath78 iteration as @xmath79 .    in the first iteration",
    ", we estimate the largest signal , @xmath52 , according to the method in section [ sec : atmospheremodel ] , and assume @xmath80 .",

    "the iterative process begins again with equation [ eq : signalestimate ] .",
    "an example time series showing the successive removal of these models is shown in figure [ fig : iterativemapping ] .",
    "we discuss the estimation of each of the various terms @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 in the following sections .",
    "it is useful at each step to produce a `` residual map '' @xmath92\\ ] ] this residual map serves as a visualization of the progress of the iterative method , since in a perfect process it would be map of @xmath56 .",
    "since atmosphere fluctuations are the largest signal in the raw data , they are modeled first . by construction , the bolocam beams",
    "as they pass through the dominant layer of atmospheric water vapor a few km above the telescope are still highly overlapped , and therefore sample a nearly identical region of atmosphere .",
    "the simplest model for the atmosphere fluctuations makes use of this fact by assuming that the largest correlated signals between detectors are due to to the atmosphere fluctuations ; this is the term @xmath52 in equation [ eq : timedomainmodel ] .",
    "we construct a model of the atmosphere fluctuations which are seen in common by all detectors , which we denote the `` median atmosphere model '' . in each iteration @xmath82",
    ", we construct the non - atmosphere - fluctuation part of the time series as @xmath93 the median atmosphere model is then simply @xmath94\\ ] ] each bolometer s timestream is then fit to the median atmosphere model , i.e. , we find @xmath95 such that @xmath87 most closely approximates @xmath96 .",
    "this defines the relative gains of the detectors as @xmath97 the @xmath98 converge fairly rapidly .",
    "( see the discussion in section [ sec : fluxcalibration ] . )",
    "the simple common mode model of equation [ eq : meanatmospheremodel ] does not remove all of the signal correlated at zero time lag between the bolometers .",
    "some of this remaining correlated signal may also be atmosphere .",
    "@xcite found for the 2.1 mm bolocam data that the subtraction of a second order spatial polynomial across the array accounted for nearly all of their residual noise ; however , the 1.1 mm data seem to have additional correlated components that are not completely described by such a model . therefore , to further remove the atmosphere ( and any other correlated instrument noise ) without a detailed physical model , we use a principal component analysis ( pca ) as given in @xcite .",
    "while this method was developed for point source detection in deep , high - redshift surveys , the technique works equally well for this survey , with the caveat that it removes large - scale structure on the size of the array fov .",
    "this effect is mitigated by the iterative process ( the @xcite analysis did not iterate ) .",
    "figure [ fig : pca_graphical ] shows an example of the modes removed by the pca model .",
    "these are a graphical visualization of the terms @xmath53 in equation [ eq : timedomainmodel ] .",
    "most of the instrument error signals have characteristic features which aid in their removal . in particular , unlike the atmosphere emission and correlated signals described above , these signals are _ not _ correlated between detector channels .",
    "the error signals include the following :    1 .",
    "pickup from the 60 hz ac power .",
    "this appears as narrow lines in the power spectral density ( psd ) of the data .",
    "the second harmonic of 60 hz is aliased via beating against the 130 hz bolometer bias frequency into 10 hz with sidebands split at @xmath99 hz .",
    "it is removed by replacing components at these frequencies in the fourier transform with gaussian noise matched to the local mean amplitude .",
    "spikes in voltage due to cosmic ray strikes on the bolometers ( `` glitches '' ) .",
    "an example of a glitch in the time series is shown in figure [ fig : glitches ] , along with the extracted distribution .",
    "microphonic pickup due to vibrations of the receiver .",
    "the microphonic effect is due to a change in the capacitive coupling of the readout wires to the circuit ground , which is converted by the high impedance of the detectors into a measurable signal , much like a condenser microphone .",
    "the most noticeable microphonics occur at the end of each scan when the telescope is turning around and the field rotator is adjusting .",
    "this leads to broad spikes in the time series , whose long decay must be removed from the data , particularly during the beginnings of scans .",
    "fortunately , most of the ac powerline pick - up occurs at frequencies where there is no astrophysical signal , given the beam size and scan speed ( c.f .",
    "figure 1 of @xcite ) . thus this error",
    "is dealt with by first notch filtering at the line frequencies and then low - pass filtering the data .",
    "because of the low correlation with astrophysical signal , this step is performed only once and is not iterated .",
    "both glitches and microphonic pickup from the scan turnarounds are degenerate with astrophysical signal and must be estimated as part of the iterative process .",
    "glitches are identified as large excursions from the rms level after subtraction of the best atmosphere and bright source model , and the data there is excluded in subsequent maps .",
    "the turnaround microphonics are explicitly modeled as decaying exponentials at the beginnings and ends of scans .",
    "residuals from this model may also be removed by the pca cleaning .",
    "after iteratively subtracting the astrophysical model , each scan also has a fifth order polynomial fit in time removed to deal with the longest time scale modes ( @xmath55 in equation [ eq : timedomainmodel ] ) .",
    "these modes are not correlated between detectors .",
    "they correspond to spatial scales much larger than those to which bolocam remains sensitive after subtraction of the pca model , so their subtraction produces maps with fewer `` stripes '' , without appreciably degrading the signal .      due to the large volume of data generated by the survey , it was necessary to develop new tools to quickly visualize the data and ensure data quality .",
    "a common tool in radio astronomy is the so - called `` waterfall '' plot , which is an image with frequency on the x - axis , time on the y , and an intensity proportional to the interferometer visibility amplitude or phase .",
    "we have used a variant on this to visualize the bolocam data by displaying bolometer number ( related to the bolometer position in the focal plane ) on the x - axis and time on the y , with the intensity given by the bolometer s response ( in jy ) at that time .",
    "an example of this is shown in figure [ fig : flagger ] .",
    "anomalies such as the glitch shown can be detected manually ( with practice ) and interactively flagged out .",
    "an automated flagger was also created that flags out outlier data on a per - map - pixel basis . in order to make a robust measurement of the variance of the fluxes assigned to each pixel , we used the median average deviation ( mad ) over the data in the pixel and rejected high and low outliers at the 3-sigma level . pixels with too little data to compute a deviation , i.e. those with @xmath100 data points , were also flagged out - these scan - edge pixels are the dominant contribution to the total number of flagged data points .",
    "the fraction of the data flagged by all methods was about 0.08% .",
    "the timestream data is made into a spatial map using the pointing data corresponding to each time point for each bolometer .",
    "the data is weighted by inverse variance across a single scan and then drizzled into a map with @xmath101 pixels using a nearest - neighbor algorithm .",
    "the nearest - neighbor matching allows the map to be returned to a timestream in the same manner , but with the s / n improved by averaging over all hits on a given pixel .",
    "it has the disadvantage that it accentuates the unevenness of the cross - scan sampling , since each timestream point s value is assigned to an area much smaller than the beam . in principle",
    "this can be addressed by various gridding algorithms , and may be a part of future releases of the bgps data .    the resulting map is then subjected to a maximum - entropy clean algorithm @xcite using a specified kernel to produce a deconvolved image which is mapped back into the timestream to be subtracted ( equation [ eq : maptotime ] ) .",
    "this has several advantages over using the original map directly , including rejecting artifacts smaller than the kernel and decreasing the noise of the resulting timestream .",
    "it is also better than a `` threshold '' method , which tends to produce discontinuities and include noise outliers .    in some fields , flux from some sources",
    "spread out over the course of the iterative process using certain kernel sizes .",
    "the cause of this artifact is not yet well - understood , but using a different kernel size was an effective workaround and did little to change the properties of the final map .",
    "the standard kernel size was a 144 fwhm gaussian ; a 216 kernel was used when artifacts were encountered .",
    "simulations indicate that this change in kernel has a negligible effect on the flux of the source ; see section [ sec : fluxcalibration ] .",
    "we also investigated whether the choice of deconvolution kernel produced a noticeable effect on the recovered flux .",
    "figure [ fig : deconvolution ] demonstrates the effects of using various kernel sizes .",
    "the best results , as determined by the flux recovered in simulations and examination of the residual maps , were produced by a kernel smaller than the beam but larger than the pixel size used .",
    "the weighting of the time stream data used to produce a map is given in equation [ eq : noisecovariance ] .",
    "if the noise were uncorrelated between timestream points , then @xmath102 would be diagonal .",
    "if the noise _ is _ correlated between time samples , but is stationary , i.e. , the noise properties are time - translation invariant @xmath103 and the weighting can be done using the fourier transform of the correlation , which is diagonal : @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the power spectrum of the noise @xmath67 . finally , if the noise is gaussian , then the covariance matrix provides all the necessary statistical information about the noise .",
    "in practice , few of these assumptions hold for the  data : the noise is not stationary , due to atmosphere variations , and the unsubtracted astrophysical signal causes the residuals from which we estimate the noise to be non - gaussian .",
    "further , the true remaining correlations between detectors due to unsubtracted atmosphere are difficult to estimate .",
    "our approach , then , is to use a non - optimal but reasonable weighting , estimating the noise from the integral over the power spectrum of the residual timestream for each bolometer and each raster separately .",
    "this accounts for the non - stationarity but ignores the correlations , which are small after the pca subtraction .    the residual maps @xmath106 ( equation [ eq : residualmap ] ) form the basis for the noise estimation in the map domain , and also provide a way of estimating the systematic error resulting from imperfect subtraction of bright sources .",
    "these maps are produced for each region from the data residuals after removing the terms @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath55 , and @xmath54 in equation [ eq : timedomainmodel ] .",
    "an example of a residual map is shown in figure [ fig : deconvolution ] . in an ideal case , the residual map @xmath106 represents a map of a realization of the underlying irreducible noise @xmath56 . however , the imperfect estimation of the signal results in `` ghosts '' of bright sources .",
    "these features are a guide to the number of iterations necessary and an estimate of the remaining systematic error . in constructing the  catalog ,",
    "r10found that smoothed versions of the residual maps provide a reliable means of determining the pixel - to - pixel error which accounts for the local variations in the noise , including those due to such artifacts ( c.f . r10  figure 2 ) . because observing conditions varied widely during the survey , the rms noise level varies over the bgps . however , the noise within a given @xmath33 field is fairly uniform in the absence of very bright sources .",
    "the noise level varies between 11  and 53  mjy  beam@xmath12  in the inner galaxy .",
    "we show the variation of the depth as a function of galactic longitude in figure [ fig : noisevslongitude ] .",
    "this noise level interacts with the source density to produce the completeness of source extraction .",
    "the variation of completeness as a function of galactic longitude , determined by simulations of the source extraction , is shown in r10figure 9 .",
    "the absolute flux calibration is derived from observations of mars and uranus ( the `` primary calibrators '' ) .",
    "the millimeter - wave flux of these planets is known to @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "the fluxes from these models were extracted using the jcmt s fluxes program with a central frequency 271.1 ghz and bandwidth 46.0 ghz ( table [ tab : colorcorrections ] ) .",
    "calibrations at ( sub)millimeter wavelengths are strongly affected by atmospheric opacity corrections .",
    "further , the detector responsivity of bolocam s bolometers is a non - linear function of the mean atmospheric loading . to address both of these problems and relate observations of the primary calibrators to observations of the bgps fields ,",
    "we make use of the following relation .",

    "we have used the measured potential difference across the detector thermistor @xmath114 as a proxy for @xmath42 , since the bolometer resistance is a single - valued function of loading .",
    "this quantity is monitored continuously for all observations .",
    "note that this calibration curve folds in both the effects of changing atmospheric transmission and the changes in the detector response with optical loading .",
    "the calibrator field observations were obtained and reduced differently from the science fields .",
    "calibrators were observed in @xmath115 radius fields with two sets of observations , scanned in orthogonal directions . in these small fields ,",
    "the iterative process tended to diverge with more iterations because of instabilities in the deconvolution procedure .",
    "therefore , the calibration curve was determined from non - iteratively - mapped calibrator maps .",
    "a future work will explore applying a more consistent application of the processing to both calibrator and science fields .",
    "a fit to the observed values ( @xmath114 vs. @xmath113 ) for the primary calibrators was performed for each epoch separately .",
    "the agreement between epochs was good , so a single combined calibration was used for all data .",
    "the calibration curve is shown in figure [ fig : calibrationcurves ] .",
    "the resulting error on the calibration curve fit is less than @xmath116 ( statistical ) over the observed range of @xmath42 .",
    "the above flux density calibration only accounts for the average calibration of bolometer volts to janskys .",
    "it is also necessary to account for the variation of bolometer response across the focal plane ( often referred to as `` flat - fielding '' ) .",
    "we do this by monitoring the response to the atmosphere emission in all bolometers ( astrophysical signal is negligible in comparison to the sky except towards sgrb2 ) .",
    "being in the near field , the atmosphere is common to all detectors , and thus this serves as a common relative reference to calibrate out variation in the individual detector responsivities and optical efficiencies .",
    "( for more detail regarding the properties of atmospheric noise above mauna kea as inferred from the bolocam data , see @xcite . )",
    "the change in relative response with loading for a typical detector is shown in figure [ fig : calibrationcurves ] .",
    "the actual application of the method to the time series of the bolometer data is shown in figure [ fig : flatfield ] , where it is clear that correlation of the timestreams is indeed improved by the application of a single multiplicative factor ( the @xmath98 of equation [ eq : relativegains ] ) .",
    "the bolocam point spread function ( psf , or `` beam '' ) is measured using the planets uranus and neptune , which are nearly point sources for bolocam . by stacking all observations of planets , we obtain a high s / n profile of the beam ; this is shown in figure [ fig : psf ] . the main lobe is fit to a gaussian profile .",
    "this yields the effective beam fwhm of 33 , corresponding to a sigma of 142 and equivalent tophat radius of 198 .",

    "the calibration from jy  beam@xmath12  into surface brightness ( mjy sr@xmath12 ) is obtained once the beam area is determined .",
    "for the bgps , the conversion factor is @xmath118 for the standard 72 pixel size .",
    "the uncertainty in the mean beam diameter is @xmath119 , leading to a corresponding @xmath120 uncertainty in the beam area ( and in the surface brightness calibration ) .",
    "this factor is in addition to the uncertainty in the best fit @xmath114 versus @xmath113 curve .    due to the sidelobes of the beam",
    ", aperture photometry may not capture all of the flux from a point source if the aperture is too small .",
    "r10  used a standard set of apertures , and the multiplicative correction factors to be applied to fluxes obtained from these apertures for a point source are given in table [ tab : aperturecorrections ] .",
    "the correction is only significant for apertures @xmath121 , beyond which effectively all of the flux is included . for extended objects ,",
    "the situation is more complicated because of the effects of the mapping algorithm .",
    "this is discussed further in the next section .      to do accurate and meaningful photometry on the bolocam maps",
    "requires a good estimate of the noise ( section [ sec : noise ] ) but also an understanding of the spatial filtering imposed by the observing strategy and the cleaning and mapping of the data .",
    "the additional complexities of defining `` sources '' for the complicated morphologies actually observed are discussed in @xcite .",
    "here we restrict our discussion to the limitations on performing photometry imposed by the data reduction .",
    "the fundamental feature of the data is that there is a degeneracy between large spatial scale astrophysical emission and the atmosphere and other signals with long spatial or temporal variations .",
    "consequently , there are limits to the ability of the algorithm to separate the signal @xmath51 from the atmosphere @xmath52 and time - correlated terms @xmath53 in equation [ eq : signalestimate ] .",
    "inevitably , some of the signal which should be present in @xmath51 is mixed into these terms and is thus not present in the final map @xmath57 . because @xmath51 is generated from a deconvolution algorithm , it has non - zero mean by construction , but importantly , it does _ not _ contain an unbiased estimate of the astrophysical signal on all spatial scales : large spatial scales are preferentially attenuated .",
    "the use of a constant factor to convert to surface brightness implicitly assumes that the response to all angular scales larger than the beam is the same .",
    "in fact , the data reduction process acts differently on sources of different angular extent . in performing photometry , the flux density  in an aperture should in fact",
    "be written as @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the flux density  in each pixel in jy  beam@xmath12 , @xmath124 is the beam solid angle in steradians , and @xmath125 is a correction factor depending on the true angular size of the source .",
    "the factor @xmath126 can deviate significantly from unity for extended sources , and as @xmath127 is generally unknown , this leads to the largest systematic uncertainty in obtaining photometric fluxes .    to determine the factor @xmath125 ( the flux recovered as a function of angular scale of the source ) , we performed a series of simulations .",
    "gaussian sources with a range of peak flux densities and sizes were inserted on top of a background consisting of real bgps time series data with the astrophysical source model removed .",
    "the simulated time series were then processed identically to the real data .",
    "the recovered fluxes were measured in ellipses that included single well - separated sources .",
    "figure [ fig : pca_filter ] shows the fraction of flux recovered in the map as a function of source size for a range of different pca components subtracted in the cleaning .",
    "the final reduction used 13 pca components because this produced a reasonable compromise between attenuating extended structure and cleaning the atmospheric contribution . note that this is a substantially more aggressive cleaning than that used in the reduction of the bolocam observation of the _ spitzer _ cores - to - disks fields @xcite , largely because our mean integration time per pixel was @xmath24seconds , whereas theirs was @xmath24minutes .",
    "the recovered flux does depend on the source size , but importantly does _ not _ depend on the source strength except for the strongest sources ( e.g. , sgrb2 ) .",
    "while the precise effect of the flux reduction requires a full simulation of the data reduction pipeline to ascertain , the flux reduction effect can be reproduced with a relatively simple prescription which is intuitively motivated . because the atmosphere model @xmath52 and pca model @xmath53 remove from the timestream `` signals '' which are correlated spatially across the array at the same time , this effectively acts as a spatial filter on the map , removing spatial scales comparable to the array fov .",
    "we have found that a simple `` brick wall '' filter in fourier space which nulls all modes below 0.1 inverse arcminutes ( spatial scales larger than 10 ) reproduces very well the attenuation seen in the simulation .",
    "the comparison between the flux attention produced by this filter and that found from simulation is shown in figure [ fig : pca_filter ] .",
    "the implication is that the bgps is not sensitive at all to scales larger than 10 .",
    "the width of the bolocam passband is such that the effective band center , or equivalently , the flux density referred to a fixed band center , will change somewhat depending on the source spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "atmospheric transmission variations may also affect the effective passband .",
    "figure [ fig : bandpass ] shows the passband .",
    "bolocam is largely insensitive to variations in the strong water absorption lines at 183 and 325 ghz .",
    "we compute color corrections due to changes in the source spectrum in appendix [ app : colorcorrections ] .",
    "note that we have made no correction for the contamination of the continuum flux densities by emission from lines .",
    "the bolocam passband was specifically constructed to exclude the strong @xmath128 emission line at 230 ghz .",
    "we can estimate the fractional contribution of a line to the continuum as @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the line strength in kelvin , @xmath131 is the line shape ( of width @xmath132 in km s@xmath12 ) , @xmath133 is the bolocam passband ( with equivalent bandwidth @xmath112 and bandcenter @xmath134 ) , and @xmath43 is given by equation [ eq : jyperk ] .",
    "the approximation holds for lines in the center of the band .",
    "the scaling values are chosen to be typical of the line - to - continuum actually seen .",
    "thus any given line is likely to at most contribute a few percent to the measured flux , but in the most extreme star forming environments ( e.g. , sgr b2 ) we may expect that lines may contribute a substantial fraction of the total measured flux density due to the integrated effect of the lines . for an example , see the lower panel of figure [ fig : bandpass ] .    for completeness",
    ", we note that towards hii  regions , free - free emission may represent a non - trivial fraction of the millimeter flux density in addition to the thermal dust continuum .",
    "this effect is of course best assessed on a case - by - case basis by comparing the bolocam maps with radio surveys , e.g. , the vgps @xcite .",
    "comparison of the bolocam flux densities is easiest for an instrument with the same or similar bandpass , since the additional complication of the source spectral index is avoided .",
    "for this reason , we choose to make an initial comparison of the accuracy of our calibration with the mambo and simba instruments , since their passbands at 1.2 mm are quite close to that of bolocam .",
    "mambo operates on the iram 30-meter diameter telescope on pico veleta in spain , and simba operated on the 15 m sest antenna prior to that facility s closure .",
    "an important future cross - check will be comparison of the bgps flux density calibration with scuba 850 @xmath14  or atlasgal 870 @xmath14  results .",
    "the study of the cygnus - x region by @xcite ( hereafter m07 ) presents one of the largest fields in the galactic plane that has been mapped with mambo which overlaps with the bolocam survey fields .",
    "m07 used both the 37 element mambo and 117 channel mambo-2 instruments .",
    "the fwhm beam size for the observations was 11 .",
    "the mambo beam model resulting from the chopping - scanning observing strategy is described in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "a detailed description of the mambo data reduction is given in @xcite .",
    "m07 used uranus and mars as their fundamental flux calibration , with an estimated uncertainty in the flux of 20% .",
    "the effective passband of the images presented by m07 is about 90 ghz centered at 260 ghz and thus includes the bright j = 21 co transition ( see figure [ fig : bandpass ] ) .",
    "a survey of 2 square degrees towards @xmath135 was conducted by @xcite ( hereafter m09 ) .",
    "these images have 22resolution , and unlike the m07 survey , which used chopping and scanning simultaneously , the simba data were obtained in fast scan mode only .    to compare the bgps images to the m07 and m09 images",
    ", we first obtained the data in fits image format .",
    "the m07 data is publicly available .",
    "the m09 data was kindly provided by h. kirk ( private communication ) .",
    "all data were re - gridded to a common projection and coordinate system grid with 4  pixels using the program montage .",
    "we then converted to @xmath136  in a given pixel based on the beam and pixel sizes .",
    "finally , the bolocam map was convolved with either an 11  ( m07 ) or 22(m09 ) fwhm gaussian and the m07 and m09 maps are convolved with a 33  fwhm gaussian so that the effective resolution of the two pairs ( bgps - m07 , bgps - m09 ) is the same .",
    "the convolution preserves the total flux in the map , but changes the aperture in which that flux appears .",
    "this results in maps which , were the calibration and observed features in each map identical , can be compared on a pixel - by - pixel basis .",
    "the plots of pixel values versus each other are shown in figure [ fig : fluxcomparison ] .",
    "the bgps values are indeed correlated with both m07 and m09 over a range of about two orders of magnitude , but with a large amount of scatter .",
    "we attribute the scatter to both noise but primarily to the difference in the handling of extended structure between the different surveys .",
    "however , the average value of the correlation coefficient deviates significantly from 1 in comparing to both m07 and m09 , with a multiplicative factor of 1.21 to 1.51 required to make the bgps fluxes match the other surveys ( or 0.66 to 0.83 to make the other surveys agree with the bgps ) .",
    "this factor also depends on the range over which the fit is done , as given in table [ tab : fluxcomparison ] . including all pixels down to 3  @xmath136  produces systematically larger required correction factor .",
    "using the average value ( to account for variation of the factor with brightness ) yields a factor of 1.35 . for a dust spectral index of @xmath137 ,",
    "the 1.2 mm measurements should have produced a flux that is about 12% lower than that measured by bgps ( see table [ tab : colorcorrections ] ) .",
    "assuming this is a typical spectral index for these clumps , * we therefore note that one must multiply by a factor of 1.35 @xmath138 1.12 = 1.5 ( with a range of plus or minus 0.15 ) the version 1.0 images and catalog released through ipac to obtain good agreement with these surveys .",
    "*    the source of this discrepancy remains unclear .",
    "it is unlikely to be due to line contamination in the mambo / simba bands .",
    "line contamination could increase the continuum flux by at most a few percent for mambo ( see equation [ eq : linecontamination ] ) , while being negligible for bolocam . for most sources , it is also not obvious that the discrepancy is due to filtering of extended structure .",
    "the filtering does not reach the requisite 50% needed to explain the difference until the source fwhm reaches 230(figure [ fig : pca_filter ] ) .",
    "however , the simulations were run on gaussian sources , and it is still not certain whether the filter function differs for other source shapes .",
    "the effective filter functions of the simba and mambo surveys are also not well understood .",
    "work is ongoing to thoroughly investigate all potential sources of this discrepancy with further more realistic simulations , a new treatment of atmosphere removal and application of distortion corrections .",
    "in addition , the processing for bright flux densitycalibrators in the current pipeline is different from the processing of the science fields , and attempts are being made to process the different observation types with an identical pipeline .",

    "<S> we present the bolocam galactic plane survey ( bgps ) , a 1.1 mm continuum survey at 33  effective resolution of 170square degrees of the galactic plane visible from the northern hemisphere . </S>",
    "<S> the bgps is one of the first large area , systematic surveys of the galactic plane in the millimeter continuum without pre - selected targets . </S>",
    "<S> the survey is contiguous over the range @xmath0 , @xmath1 . towards the cygnus x spiral arm , </S>",
    "<S> the coverage was flared to @xmath2 for @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , cross - cuts to @xmath2 were made at @xmath4  3 , 15 , 30 and 31 . </S>",
    "<S> the total area of this section is 133 square degrees . with the exception of the increase in latitude , </S>",
    "<S> no pre - selection criteria were applied to the coverage in this region . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the contiguous region , four targeted regions in the outer galaxy were observed : ic1396 ( 9 square degrees , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) , a region towards the perseus arm ( 4 square degrees centered on @xmath7 , @xmath8 near ngc7538 ) , w3/4/5 ( 18 square degrees , @xmath9 ) and gem ob1 ( 6 square degrees , @xmath10 ) .    the survey has detected approximately 8400  clumps over the entire area to a limiting non - uniform 1-@xmath11 noise level in the range 11  to 53  mjy  beam@xmath12  in the inner galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the bgps source catalog is presented in a companion paper @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this paper details the survey observations and data reduction methods for the images . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss in detail the determination of astrometric and flux density calibration uncertainties and compare our results to the literature . </S>",
    "<S> data processing algorithms that separate astronomical signals from time - variable atmospheric fluctuations in the data time - stream are presented . </S>",
    "<S> these algorithms reproduce the structure of the astronomical sky over a limited range of angular scales and produce artifacts in the vicinity of bright sources . based on simulations </S>",
    "<S> , we find that extended emission on scales larger than about 59 is nearly completely attenuated ( @xmath13 ) and the linear scale at which the attenuation reaches 50% is 38 . </S>",
    "<S> comparison with other millimeter - wave data sets implies a possible systematic offset in flux calibration , for which no cause has been discovered .    </S>",
    "<S> this presentation serves as a companion and guide to the public data release through nasa s infrared processing and analysis center ( ipac ) infrared science archive ( irsa ) . </S>",
    "<S> new data releases will be provided through ipac - irsa with any future improvements in the reduction . </S>",
    "<S> the bgps provides a complementary long - wavelength spectral band for the ongoing atlasgal and _ herschel_-spire surveys , and an important database and context for imminent observations with scuba-2 and alma . </S>"
