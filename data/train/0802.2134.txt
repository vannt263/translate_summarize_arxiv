    "limiting the interference between nodes in a sensor network is substantial for the energy - efficiency of the network . a common approach to reduce interference is _ topology control _ ,",
    "i.e. , restricting the communication graph ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "a theoretical problem in topology control which has been stated as essential to understanding sensor networks is the following .",
    "[ prb : tc ] given @xmath0 nodes in the plane .",
    "connect the nodes by a spanning tree .",
    "for each node @xmath1 we construct a disk centering at @xmath1 with radius equal to the distance to @xmath1 s furthest neighbor in the spanning tree .",
    "the interference of a node @xmath1 is then defined as the number of disks that include node @xmath1 ( not counting the disk of @xmath1 itself ) .",
    "find a spanning tree that minimizes the maximum interference .",
    "the choice of the radii as given in the problem statement guarantees that the symmetric communication graph contains a spanning tree , i.e. , that the symmetric communication graph is connected .",
    "the _ symmetric communication graph _ is the undirected graph on the nodes with edges between nodes which both lie in each others _ transmission ranges _ ,",
    "i.e. , in each others circles .",
    "we refer to the radii of the circles as _",
    "transmission radii_.    we prove that problem  [ prb : tc ] is np - hard .",
    "so far no lower bounds for the problem were known .",
    "halldrsson and tokuyama  @xcite give an algorithm which yields a maximum interference in @xmath2 .",
    "an open problem that remains is to narrow the gap between this upper bound and our lower bound . for the case of points on a line",
    "there is a @xmath3{n}$]-approximation algorithm  @xcite . in a generalized version of the problem",
    "there is a positive real value associated with each ( ordered ) pair of nodes , and the first node can send a message to the second node ( but will also interfere with it ) if its transmission power is above this value . in this version",
    "an approximation within less than a logarithmic factor in polynomial time is not possible unless np has slightly superpolynomial time algorithms  @xcite .",
    "in this section we prove that deciding whether the maximum interference of a network is at most @xmath4 is np - complete . strictly speaking",
    ", this implies that the interference in problem  [ prb : tc ] can not be approximated within a factor less than @xmath5 efficiently , since it is not possible to distinguish between interference @xmath4 and @xmath6 in polynomial time unless @xmath7 .",
    "we prove the np - hardness by a polynomial reduction from the problem of finding a _ hamilton path _ in a _ grid graph _ of maximum degree @xmath4 .",
    "a ( vertex - induced ) grid graph is a graph for which the vertex set is a finite subset of the two - dimensional integer grid @xmath8 and there is an edge between two vertices @xmath9 exactly if @xmath9 are neighbors on the grid , i.e. , @xmath10 .",
    "we identify the corresponding edge with the line segment from @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
    "a hamilton path in a graph is a path in the graph with every vertex lying exactly once on the path . deciding whether a hamilton path in a grid graph with maximum degree @xmath4 exists is np - hard  @xcite .    for the reduction we need for any grid graph of maximum degree @xmath4 a polynomial construction of a set of nodes such that there is a hamilton path in the grid graph exactly if there is a spanning tree with maximum interference at most @xmath4 .",
    "we may assume that the grid graph has no isolated vertex because in that case there is no hamilton path and we can check this in linear time .      * a _ center node _",
    ": a node at position @xmath11 , * _ satellite nodes _ : three further nodes at three disjoint positions from the set @xmath14 .",
    "the satellites are chosen such that the vertex gadget has a satellite node on every edge at @xmath11 of the grid graph .",
    "if the degree of @xmath11 is less than 3 , the remaining satellites can be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "for the np - hardness we need to prove that the grid graph has a hamilton path exactly if the corresponding node set has a spanning tree with interference at most @xmath4 .",
    "we get one of the implications by constructing such a tree from a hamilton path .",
    "this yields the following interferences : a center node is in the transmission range of its satellites .",
    "it is not in the transmission range of any other node since it has distance at least @xmath17 to any other node .",
    "thus the interference at a center node is @xmath4 .",
    "a satellite is in the transmission range of the center node .",
    "it is in the transmission range of any ( other ) satellite in its vertex gadget that connects to a partner .",
    "if it connects to its partner , it is in the transmission range of the partner .",
    "there can be no further interference at a satellite since all other nodes have distance at least @xmath17 to the satellite .    in a ( hamilton ) path",
    "every vertex of the grid graph is connected to at most two other vertices .",
    "therefore in a vertex gadget at most two satellites connect to their partners .",
    "this yields an interference of at most 3 at satellites .",
    "[ lem : partners ] assume a grid graph has no isolated vertices .",
    "if a spanning tree on the corresponding set of nodes has an edge between two different vertex gadgets other than an edge between partners then there is a node with interference at least @xmath6 .",
    "suppose a satellite connects to a node which is further away than its partner . in this case",
    "it contains at least one center node outside of its vertex gadget in its transmission range .",
    "since this center node will also lie in the transmission ranges of its satellites , it will have interference at least @xmath6 .",
    "suppose we have a spanning tree in which from each vertex gadget at most two satellites connect to partners .",
    "then this directly gives us a hamilton path in the corresponding grid graph by simply connecting the vertices in the same way as the vertex gadgets .",
    "now assume there is a spanning tree with interference at most @xmath4 which is not of this type .",
    "the spanning tree has a vertex gadget that connects to at least three other vertex gadgets and by lemma  [ lem : partners ] these must be connections from satellites to their partners . thus all three satellites in the vertex gadget connect to their partners .",
    "now all three satellites lie in the transmission range of their partner , of the other two satellites , and of the center node of the gadget .",
