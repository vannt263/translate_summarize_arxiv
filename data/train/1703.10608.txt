    "acoustic metamaterials , namely structured materials made of resonant building blocks , present strong dispersion around the resonance frequency . in acoustic waveguides ,",
    "this resonance - induced dispersion was observed for the first time by sugimoto@xcite and bradley@xcite .",
    "later , liu _",
    "et al._@xcite paved the way for the realization of acoustic metamaterials , through arrangements of locally resonant elements , that could be described as effective media with negative effective parameters , not found in natural materials .",
    "since then , a plethora of exotic properties of acoustic metamaterials have been intensively exploited showing novel wave control phenomena ; these include subwavelength focusing@xcite , cloaking @xcite , perfect absorption @xcite and extraordinary transmission@xcite among others@xcite .",
    "generally , dispersion , nonlinearity and dissipation play a key role in wave propagation , with all these phenomena appearing generically in practice .",
    "however , in acoustic metamaterials and up to now only few works have systematically consider the interplay between all the above phenomena@xcite .",
    "particularly , in some works , the combined effects of dissipation and dispersion were studied without considering the nonlinearity@xcite ; in this case , the relevance of dissipation was further exploited to the design of perfect absorbers@xcite .",
    "in fact , the majority of works on acoustic metamaterials focus on the linear regime and do not consider the nonlinear response of the structure . nevertheless , due to the intrinsically nonlinear nature of the problem and the strong dispersion introduced by the locally resonant building blocks , acoustic metamaterials are good candidates to study the combined effects of nonlinearity and dispersion that can give rise to interesting nonlinear effects .",
    "these include the beating of the higher generated harmonics@xcite , self demodulation@xcite , as well as the emergence of solitons@xcite , namely robust localized waves propagating undistorted due to a balance between dispersion and nonlinearity . in this work ,",
    "we show the existence and investigate the dynamics of bright and gap solitons in an acoustic metamaterial composed of an air - filled waveguide , periodically loaded by clamped elastic plates , taking into regard viscothermal losses . based on the transmission line ( tl ) approach used widely in acoustics @xcite",
    ", we derive a nonlinear dynamical lattice model which , in the continuum approximation , leads to a nonlinear dispersive and dissipative wave equation . by applying the multiple scales perturbation method",
    ", we find that the evolution of the pressure can be described by a nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation incorporating linear loss .",
    "we thus show that in the lossless case the system supports envelope solitons , which are found in a closed analytical form .",
    "we perform direct numerical simulations , in the framework of the nonlinear lattice model , and show that both bright and gap solitons are supported in the system ; numerical results are found to be in good agreement with the analytical solutions of the nls equation .",
    "in addition , we numerically and analytically study the effect of viscothermal losses on the envelope solitons , showing that , for the particular setting considered herein , the soliton solutions are less affected by the losses than dispersion .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "[ sec2 ] , we introduce our setup and derive the one - dimensional ( 1d ) nonlinear dissipative lattice model , as well as the nonlinear dissipative and dispersive wave equation and the associated dispersion relation . in section [ sec3 ] , we derive the lossy nls equation via the multiple scale perturbation method .",
    "then , we start by studying the dynamics of bright solitons , both in the lossless and lossy cases , and we complete our investigations by presenting the dynamics of gap solitons . finally , section [ sec5 ] summarizes our findings and discusses future research directions .",
    "a schematic view of the acoustic waveguide periodically loaded by clamped elastic plates , as well as the respective unit - cell structure of this setup are respectively shown in figs .  [",
    "fig : fig1](a ) and [ fig : fig1](b ) .",
    "we consider low - frequency wave propagation in this setting , i.e. , the frequency range is well below the first cut - off frequency of the higher propagating modes in the waveguide , therefore the problem is considered as one - dimensional ( 1d ) .    in order to theoretically analyze this system",
    ", we employ the electro - acoustic analogy ; this allows us to derive a nonlinear discrete wave equation for an equivalent electrical tl , which , in the continuum limit , can be studied by means of the method of multiple scales .",
    "our approach is much simpler than the one relying on the study of a nonlinear acoustic wave equation coupled with a set of differential equations describing the dynamics of each elastic plate .",
    "furthermore , our approach allows for a straightforward analytical treatment of the problem by means of standard techniques that are used in other physical systems@xcite .    the unit - cell circuit of the equivalent tl model of this setting is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](c ) .",

    "the above considerations are valid in the low frequency regime , i.e. , when the wavelength @xmath4 .",

    "losses originating from the dynamic response of the elastic plates are not taken into account in this work .",
    "the part of the unit - cell circuit that corresponds to the waveguide solely ( i.e. , without the elastic plates and the associated periodic structure ) is modeled by the inductance @xmath14 , the resistance @xmath15 and shunt capacitance @xmath16 ; the linear part of the inductance is @xmath17 and the capacitance is @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the density and the sound velocity of the fluid in the waveguide respectively ; the latter , has a cross section @xmath21 .",

    "we approximate the frequency dependent viscothermal losses by a resistance with a constant value around the frequency of the narrow spectral width envelope solutions that we are interested in . at this point",
    ", we mention that we consider the response of the elastic plate to be linear , while the propagation in the waveguide weakly nonlinear .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation , since the pressure amplitudes used in this work are not sufficiently strong to excite nonlinear vibrations of the elastic plate@xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it is well known that due to the compressibility of air the wave celerity is nonlinear , @xmath33 .",
