    "the two - dimensional organic charge - transfer salts based on bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafulvalene ( bedt - ttf or even shorter et ) molecules in a @xmath0-type lattice arrangement have been intensively studied over the past thirty years due to their complex interplay between electron correlation and the effects of low dimensionality and spin frustration .",
    "@xcite in particular , the discovery of spin - liquid behavior in @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1cu@xmath1(cn)@xmath2  @xcite has fascinated experimentalists and theorists alike .",
    "issues of current interest concern the nature of the low - temperature spin - liquid realized in this material  @xcite and the various anomalies observed upon approaching the spin - liquid state from high temperatures .",
    "these anomalies include drastic changes in the @xmath4h - nmr relaxation rate around 200 - 150  k  @xcite , the thermopower at 150  k  @xcite , relaxor - type ferroelectricity around 60k  @xcite and a mysterious phase - transition anomaly at 6k  @xcite .",
    "the latter feature , which manifests itself in anomalies in thermodynamic  @xcite and transport  @xcite quantities , is accompanied by pronounced lattice effects .",
    "@xcite various scenarios have been suggested for the 6k anomaly including a crossover from a thermally to a quantum disordered state  @xcite , an instability of the quantum spin - liquid  @xcite or a distinct type of charge ordering .",
    "@xcite theoretically , the spin - liquid properties have been investigated on the basis of the anisotropic triangular - lattice hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "@xcite the parameters @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 of this hamiltonian have been determined with semi - empirical  @xcite as well as first principles methods  @xcite based on the experimental structure at room temperature .",
    "missing in such investigations is , however , the consideration of a possible temperature dependence of the model parameters .    in this work , we find by a combination of single crystal x - ray diffraction at various temperatures and density functional theory calculations that even in the absence of structural phase transitions , the temperature dependence of the structural parameters is significant enough to influence the electronic behavior and the determination of the hamiltonian model parameters in @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1cu@xmath1(cn)@xmath2 .",
    "we suggest that this has subtle effects on the degree of frustration and interaction strength .    in 1991 ,",
    "the crystal structure of @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1cu@xmath1(cn)@xmath2 was first reported ,  @xcite and the unit cell parameters confirmed ,  @xcite on twinned crystals at room temperature .",
    "the crystal structure was redetermined in 1993 , also on a twinned crystal at room temperature .",
    "@xcite the crystal structure of the very similar @xmath8-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1cu@xmath1(cn)@xmath2 structure , which is reported to be an ambient pressure superconductor , was described in 1992 .",
    "@xcite the crystal structure of the @xmath0 phase was subsequently redetermined in 1997 ,  @xcite and the unit cell redetermined in 2001 , both at room temperature .",
    "@xcite already in 1991 , the unit cell parameters were reported at 300 and 30  k , with @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "@xcite our comparable contraction values between 300 and 20  k are @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , and @xmath16 and agree well with the previous results . in addition , we find evidence for an ordering of the ethylene groups in a staggered conformation between 200 - 150  k. despite the current interest in this material as a spin - liquid candidate , no low - temperature structural determinations have yet been reported .",
    "herein , we present a detailed characterization of the crystal structure as function of temperature determined on a single crystal with agreement factors better than any previously reported .",
    "a black , plate - like crystal of @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1cu@xmath1(cn)@xmath2 with dimension @xmath17  mm@xmath18 was placed onto the tip of a glass fiber and mounted on a bruker apex ii 3-circle diffractometer equipped with an apex ii detector .",
    "temperature control in the 100 - 300k region was provided by an oxford cryostream 700 plus cooler while below 100k it was provided by a cryocool - lhe cryogenic system ( cryo industries of america ) .",
    "the sample temperature below 100 k was confirmed by installing a cernox thermometer ( lakeshore ) in the immediate vicinity of the crystal and stabilizing the temperature immediately prior to data collection . in order to reduce adverse thermal effects",
    "the thermometer wires ( twisted manganin wires , 0.5  mm diameter , supplied by lakeshore ) were anchored on the surfaces of the cryostat exposed to @xmath19he stream .",
    "the data were collected using mok@xmath20 radiation ( @xmath21   ) with a detector distance of 50  mm .",
    "unit cell parameters were determined upon cooling in 10  k increments between 100 and 290k , with a frame exposure time of 10 seconds .",
    "full data sets for structural analysis were collected at temperatures of 5 , 20 , 100 , 150 , 200 , 250 and 300k .",
    "the uncertainties in the temperature determination are typically @xmath22  k down to 100  k , while for the 20  k and 5  k data points an error bar of @xmath23  k has to be accepted .",
    "these data collections nominally covered over a hemisphere of reciprocal space by a combination of three sets of exposures .",
    "data to a resolution of 0.68   were considered in the reduction .",
    "the raw intensity data were corrected for absorption ( sadabs  @xcite ) . the structure was solved and refined using shelxtl .",
    "@xcite a direct - method solution was calculated , which provided most of atomic positions from the e - map .",
    "full - matrix least squares / difference fourier cycles were performed , which located the remaining atoms .",
    "all non - hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic displacement parameters .",
    "the hydrogen atoms were placed in ideal positions and refined as riding atoms with relative isotropic displacement parameters .",
