    "in spite of advances in the description of liquids near the glass transition using different approaches @xcite the phenomenon is generally not completely understood .",
    "supercooled fluids reveal often a non - arrhenius behavior of relaxation times and a characteristic stretched exponential decay of correlation functions . but a long range order is not developed in contrast to conventional phase transitions .",
    "the dynamics of the glass transition can be described by an increasing cooperativity of local processes with decreasing temperature@xcite .",
    "the cooperativity leads to the well known slowing down of the relaxation times which can be illustrated by a strongly curved trajectory in the arrhenius plot ( logarithm of the relaxation time @xmath2 versus the inverse temperature @xmath3 ) .",
    "one possible fit of this curve is given by the williams - landel - ferry ( wlf ) relation@xcite , i.e. @xmath4 with a finite vogel temperature @xmath5 .",
    "mode coupling theories @xcite ( mct ) predict a completely ergodic decay of correlation functions above a critical temperature @xmath6 and an incomplete decay below @xmath6 .",
    "the incomplete decay is usually identified as the relatively fast @xmath7process caused by processes related to the breaking up of the local cages .",
    "the long time regime of the ergodic decay above @xmath6 is denoted as @xmath8process .",
    "the relaxation time of the @xmath8process increases rapidly with decreasing temperature and below @xmath6 only the @xmath7process remains effective , i.e. at @xmath6 the system undergoes a sharp phase transition to a state with partially frozen ( density ) fluctuations .",
    "note that @xmath6 is in the range between the melting temperature @xmath9 and the glass temperature @xmath10 , e.g. @xmath11 .",
    "it is really the @xmath8process exists also below @xmath6 .",
    "this process leads to a very slow decay of the apparently frozen structures , i.e. the nonergodic structures obtained from the mct @xcite are approximately stable only for a finite time interval .",
    "this slow decay shows the typical properties which correspond usually to the dynamics of the main glass transition ( wlf like behavior of the relaxation time , stretched exponential decay of the correlation function ) .",
    "this effects can be partially described in terms of an extended mode coupling theory @xcite introducing additional hopping processes .",
    "there exists also various alternative descriptions @xcite which explain the cooperative motion of the particles inside a supercooled liquid below @xmath6 .",
    "one of these possibilities is the @xmath1spin facilitated kinetic ising model @xcite , originally introduced by fredrickson and andersen .",
    "the base idea of this model consists in a coarse graining of space and time scales and simultaneously a reduction of the degrees of freedom . in detail",
    "that means :    1 .",
    "_ coarse graining of spatial scales _ : the supercooled liquid is separated into cells , so that each cell contains a sufficiently large number of particles which realize a representative number of molecular motions , i.e. the many body system is considered of a virtual lattice with the unit size @xmath12 .",
    "this lattice has no influence on the underlying dynamics of the supercooled liquid .",
    "_ reduction of the degrees of freedom _ : each cell will be characterized by only one trivial degree of freedom , i.e. the cell structure enables us to attach to each cell an observable @xmath13 which characterizes the actual state of particles inside the cell @xmath14 .",
    "the usual realization is given by the local density @xmath15 ( particles per cell ) with @xmath16 if @xmath17 and @xmath18 if @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the averaged density of the system .",
    "this mapping implies consequently different mobilities of the particles inside such a cell , i.e. @xmath16 corresponds to a more immobile ( or solid like ) state and @xmath18 to a more mobile ( or liquid like ) state of the cell @xmath14 .",
    "the set of all observables @xmath21 forms a configuration .",
    "the evolution of the statistical probability distribution function @xmath22 can be described by a generalized master equation @xcite using a projection of the real dynamics onto the dynamics of @xmath23 : @xmath24 3 .",
    "_ coarse graining of the time scale _ : the last step bases on the assumption that possible memory terms @xmath25 of the generalized master equation is mainly determined by fast molecular processes while the slow dynamics is mainly reflected by the temporally local contributions @xmath26 .",
    "of course , the validity of this assumption depends strongly on the choice of the remaining degrees of freedom , and in many cases it is very hard ( or impossible from the actual point of view ) to give a satisfactory explantation of this assumption .",
    "however , if this separation of the dynamics is justified , an elementary time scale larger than the time scale of the fast molecular processes can be introduced .",
    "therefore , the memory will be reduced to simple temporally local terms , i.e. @xmath27 .",
    "one obtains an evolution equation which is equivalent to the mathematical representation of a usual master equation .",
    "@xmath28 the dynamical matrix @xmath29 is determined by the above discussed formal procedure .",
    "unfortunately , a direct calculation is mostly very complicated , so that one should use reasonable assumptions about the mathematical structure of @xmath30 .    to make the time evolution of the glass configurations more transparent we use the argumentation following the idea of fredrickson and andersen @xcite ,",
    "i.e. we suppose that the basic dynamics is a simple ( glauber ) process @xmath31 controlled by the thermodynamical gibb s measure and by self induced topological restrictions . in particular , an elementary flip at a given cell is allowed only if the number of the nearest neighbored mobile cells ( @xmath32 ) is equal or larger than a restriction number @xmath1 with @xmath33 ( @xmath34 : coordination number of the lattice ) .",
    "elementary flip processes and geometrical restrictions lead to the cooperative rearrangement of the underlying system and therefore to mesoscopical models describing a supercooled liquid below @xmath35 .",
    "these models @xcite are denoted as @xmath1spin facilitated ising model on a @xmath0dimensional lattice sfm@xmath36 $ ] .",
    "the self  adapting environments influence in particular the long time behavior of the spin - spin correlation functions and therefore of the corresponding density - density correlation functions .",
    "the sfm@xmath36 $ ] was studied numerically @xcite ( sfm@xmath37 $ ] ) and recently also analytically @xcite ( sfm@xmath38 $ ] ) . from this point of view",
    "it will be an interesting task to derive a set of equations related to the sfm@xmath39 $ ] which are similar to the well known mori ",
    "zwanzig equations @xcite and which can be used as a reasonable basis for a further treatment , e.g. for a continuous fraction analysis or for a mode coupling approach .",
    "the aim of the present paper is the derivation of such evolution equations and their analysis in terms of a mode coupling approach .",
    "we restrict our investigation to the analysis of the sfm@xmath40 $ ] but a generalization to another class of spin facilitated kinetic ising models is always possible .",

    "space representation . using a projection formalism",
    "one obtains evolution equations for a set of relevant observables and consequently for the corresponding correlation functions .",
    "the paper ends in an analysis of these correlation functions in terms of the frequency matrices and memory terms .",

    ", arbitrary correlation functions can be expressed by @xmath60 from this point of view , it is possible to create the evolution equations of various averages and correlation functions .",
    "for example , using ( [ fo1 ] ) and ( [ fo3 ] ) one obtains the evolution equation for an arbitrary operator @xmath61 @xcite : @xmath62\\right| f(t)\\right\\rangle\\ ] ] here we have used the necessary relation @xmath63 , which is an immediately consequence of the normalization condition .",

    "@xmath67 is a lattice function with @xmath68 if @xmath69 and @xmath14 and @xmath70 are neighbored to lattice cell @xmath71 . applying a simple activation dynamics one obtains for the jumping rates : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is an elementary temperature dependent time scale ( @xmath74 is the energy difference between the solid and liquid like state ) .",
    "note that the stationary state corresponds to an average @xmath75 which can be obtained directly from ( [ kin ] ) .",
    "the knowledge of @xmath76 and the corresponding evolution equation ( [ fo1 ] ) allows a reasonable analysis of the sfm@xmath40 $ ] .",
    "the fock space formalism has the decisive advantage of a simple construction principle for each evolution operator @xmath48 on the basis of creation and annihilation operators .",
    "therefore , this method allows investigations of master equations for various evolution processes , e.g. aggregation , chemical reactions @xcite , nonlinear diffusion @xcite and just the spin facilitated kinetic ising model .",
    "the dynamics of an arbitrary physical system can be described by a reasonable set of relevant operators .",
    "we use the normalized local deviations of the configuration from the thermodynamical average and the corresponding derivatives with respect to the time as suitable relevant observables for the investigation of the sfm@xmath40 $ ] @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ; usually the upper borderline is a finite integer number , but @xmath79 is also possible ) .",
    "these covariant operators must be extended by the corresponding contravariant operators @xmath80 using ( [ relop ] ) and ( [ relop1 ] ) we construct the backward projection operator @xmath81 : @xmath82 ( with @xmath8 , @xmath7 , ... @xmath83 $ ] ) .",
    "the projection operator leads to an identical mapping of the relevant operators onto itself , i.e. @xmath84 .",
    "consequently , the orthogonal projection operator @xmath85 is given by @xmath86 with @xmath87 .",
    "the evolution equation ( [ fo1 ] ) leads to the formal solution @xmath88 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath89 on the time can be transferred to an arbitrary operator analogous to the transformation of schrdinger s representation into the heissenberg picture .",
    "therefore one obtains time ",
    "dependent operators @xmath90 the derivation of the evolution equations for the relevant observables starts from the formal time evolution of @xmath91 .",
    "it follows from ( [ formaleloesung ] ) @xmath92 this equation is the basis for the derivation of projection equations for the relevant observables in analogy to the well known mori ",

    "hence , @xmath99 with the frequency matrix @xmath100 the second term of ( [ step01 ] ) can be rewritten by using an identical transformation of @xmath101 into an integral expression : @xmath102 this relation allows the derivation of rigorous projection equations similar to the usual mori - zwanzig - equations @xcite : @xmath103 with the residual forces @xmath104 ( with the properties @xmath105 and @xmath106 ) and the memory matrix : @xmath107 the comparison between ( [ allgmzgl ] ) and the usual mori - zwanzig - equations shows a formal equivalence . both equations",

    "the cause is the irreversible character of the underlying master equation .",

    "the true approximation consists in the breaking of the taylor expansion after a finite power of @xmath273 .",
    "we restrict our investigation to the simplest case , i.e. we assume @xmath278 for @xmath279 .",
    "hence , one obtains @xmath280 but it should be remarked that an extension to higher terms is possible without any problems . we abstain from a consideration of higher terms with respect to the clarity of the calculations .",
    "furthermore , the obtained results ( see below ) using ( [ appr1 ] ) show already a reasonable agreement with numerical simulations .",
    "the main problem is a reasonable approximation of the function @xmath281 .",
    "this function decays in products of simple pair correlation functions if the distances between the corresponding lattice points ( defined by the vectors @xmath282 and @xmath283 ) are sufficiently large : @xmath284 this asymptotic limit is correct for infinitely large ( or at least sufficiently large ) distances between the lattice cells @xmath285 , @xmath286 , .... we use this borderline case as an approximation for an arbitrary set of lattice cells @xmath287 .",
    "this approximation is equivalent to the decomposition of higher static correlation functions into simple pair correlation functions .",
    "for example , a similar approach was used to create self consistent equations for the static structure factor @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this approximation is also the kernel of the well known mode coupling approach @xcite .",
    "the third approximation consists in a reduction of the basis @xmath242 .",
    "it was demonstrated that only base operators with @xmath288 are necessary for a representation of ( [ koeff ] ) . because of the approximations ( [ appr1 ] ) and ( [ appr2 ] ) all other factors of ( [ erste ] ) contains also no higher base operators @xmath289 .",

    "this weak dependence can be expected also for the memory terms , i.e. we restrict out investigations only to the macroscopic scale @xmath210 .",
    "the assumption of a weak dependence on @xmath172 leads to : @xmath294 this approximation is related to the fact that all correlation functions between different lattice cells @xmath121 with @xmath295 ( see eq.[kf ] ) vanish for @xmath296 ( @xmath297 is the equilibrium average @xmath298 which decouples as a result of the simple hamiltonian @xmath299 , i.e. @xmath300 ) and for @xmath301 ( because of the ergodicity follows again @xmath302 ) .",

    "one obtains in the macroscopic limit by using ( [ freq08 ] ) and ( [ freq11 ] ) : @xmath306 it remains the determination of the memory . using the definition : @xmath307 and ( [ phi - phi ] ) , it follows from ( [ kapp ] ) : @xmath308 the substitution @xmath309 and @xmath310 is possible because the @xmath172dependence of these quantities is again relatively weak .",

    "this is again an algebraic procedure which can be realized straightforwardly .",
    "the final results are very unwieldy .",
    "therefore , we give only the explicit expressions for the asymptotic case of low temperatures , i.e. for @xmath318 .",

    "thus , the only nonergodic state can be observed at zero  point temperature .",
    "additionally , we obtain from ( [ freqhydro ] ) : @xmath351 thus , the nonergodic part is given by : @xmath352 i.e. an initial equilibrium configuration at @xmath348 shows no structure relaxations during the total observation time .",
    "this behavior is a consequence of the fact that the kinetic phase transition occurs at the absolute zero at temperature . in other words ,",
    "each arbitrary equilibrium configuration is frozen at @xmath353 .",
    "we obtain the important result that the sfm@xmath40 $ ] is ergodic for all finite temperatures @xmath354 .",
    "this is a real contradiction to the statements of the original papers @xcite which predict a kinetic phase transition at a finite critical temperature .",
    "of course , it is possible to explain @xmath355 by a simple picture . a finite fraction of active cells ( i.e. cells which are able to change their state without any previous change of states of neighbored cells ) exists at each temperature @xmath354 .",
    "the concentration of these active or nonfrozen cells is proportional to @xmath356 ( @xmath357 is equivalent to the probability that a cell has two neighbored cells with @xmath358 ) .",
    "active cells are mainly isolated at sufficiently low temperatures , but an annihilation of an isolated active cell is never possible .",
    "the property to be an active cell can be transferred to a neighbored cell by some few elementary flip processes , ( this procedure can be interpreted as a diffusion of active states ) , a new active cell can be created in the nearest environment of an initially active cell ( creation process ) and two neighbored active cells can be unified to one active region and further this region can be reduced to one active cell ( annihilation process ) .",
    "diffusion , annihilation and creation are well  balanced in the thermodynamical equilibrium . on the other hand ,",
    "this three processes realize a motion of active states through the whole volume , i.e. each cell is able to change their state after a sufficiently long waiting time .",

    "but it should be denoted also , that a special choice of the initial configuration excludes any type of self blockades @xcite . however , the main result of our discussion is the ergodicity of the sfm@xmath40 $ ] for @xmath354 . to analyze the relaxation behavior at finite temperatures",

    "we see that the correlation function @xmath328 shows with decreasing temperature a pronounced stretched decay over some decades , while an exponential  like decay is obtained for high temperatures .",
    "this stretching can be illustrated by a simple argument .",
    "short times ( @xmath193 or @xmath196 ) are related to a behavior @xmath366 or @xmath367 . on the other hand , the long time regime ( @xmath368 or @xmath369 )",

    "we expect a typical crossover between both regimes characterized by a stretched decay , see fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "but it should be remarked , that the decay of @xmath373 is no kohlrausch  williams  watts function ( @xmath374 . there exists only over a finite interval a reasonable fit with such a stretched exponential function @xcite .",

    "the knowledge of the spectral densities allows the determination of other interesting properties , for example the susceptibility @xmath378 , see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] .",
    "finally , the averaged relaxation time @xmath379 can be obtained by using @xmath380 this relaxation time shows with decreasing temperature an increasing deviation from the simple relaxation times ( [ ana09 ] ) . especially , one obtains now a typical non  arrhenius behavior ( fig.[fig7 ] ) .",
    "it was shown that irreversible master equations can be easily transformed into projection equations by using the fock space representation . whereas the usual projection formalisms , which leads to the well known mori  zwanzig equations , start from a reversible liouville equation , the master equations are already irreversible . as a consequence of this initial irreversibility , one obtains additional frequency matrices and memory terms .",
    "thus , these additional contributions are caused mainly by the loss of the invariance against an inversion of the time .",
    "a second important property follows from a general analysis of the frequency matrices .",
    "the corresponding poles of the laplace transformed correlation function @xmath381 are always located on the negative real axis .",
    "especially , the imaginary part of the poles vanishes identically .",
    "this behavior is related to the general structure of the master equation .",
    "the dynamical matrix @xmath47 of a master equation is always negative definite ( or better semidefinite because at least one eigen value is zero as result of the conservation of the probability ) .",
    "thus , only relaxation processes should be observed , i.e. the evolution of the probability @xmath382 can be approached by a probably infinitely large expansion in terms of exponential functions : @xmath383 with ( @xmath384 for all @xmath133 ) .",
    "one obtains no oscillations in contradiction to microscopical systems which bases on a liouville equation .",
    "the absent of oscillations is directly connected with the markov property of the underlying master equation .",
    "this behavior corresponds also to the fact that the observation of a spin wave propagation ( corresponding to density waves in a glass or a supercooled liquid ) is not possible for the sfm@xmath39 $ ] . from this point of view",
    ", the traditional notation frequency matrix can be misleading .",
    "it seems to be possibly favorable to use the notion relaxation matrix .",
    "however , we have used the traditional terminology to avoid misunderstandings and conflicts with other well defined quantities . in principle",
    ", the consideration of all possible time derivations @xmath385 ( @xmath386 ) as relevant operators leads to an infinite continuous fraction for the correlation function @xmath121 , determined by frequency matrices of various order .",
    "this representation allows a systematic analysis of the short time behavior of the sfm@xmath40 $ ] , because an infinite continuous fraction contains no memory term .",
    "unfortunately , a general explicit determination of the frequency matrices , e.g. by a successive rule , can not be obtained . on the other hand , each approximation using a finite number of frequency matrices ( e.g. @xmath387 and @xmath388 in the present case ) fails for sufficiently long times . however ,",
    "some important properties of the spin facilitated kinetic ising model can be verified for this relatively rough approximation , e.g. a weak non  arrhenius behavior of the relaxation times .",
    "note , that this result is in agreement with various numerical simulations @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the typical stretched decay of the correlation function can not be explained by using this simple approximation .",
    "a satisfactory treatment is possible by an approximative consideration of the memory terms .",
    "this procedure leads to an equation , which is partially similar to the well known mode coupling equation of supercooled liquids .",
    "the memory terms yield the main contributions to the typical stretching of the correlation function .",
    "some small remaining deviations from the numerical results are caused by the approximations ( [ appr1 ] ) and ( [ appr2 ] ) of the memory terms . from this point of view",
    ", we come back to the initial question . which processes of the usual glass transition can be described by the spin facilitated kinetic ising models ?",
    "obviously , the spin facilitated kinetic ising model is not adequate for a description of the fast processes inside a supercooled liquid .",
    "this statement is supported by both , numerical simulations @xcite and the presented analytical investigations , which show that no fast ( @xmath7 ) processes can be observed . on the other hand ,",
    "spin facilitated kinetic ising models allow a more or less reasonable , quantitative description of the slow ( @xmath8 ) process in supercooled liquids below the critical temperature @xmath6 of the usual mode coupling theory @xcite .",
    "note that for this low temperature regime the time scales of @xmath8 and @xmath7process are well separated , i.e. a separation of the underlying dynamic is actually possible and it is considered in the structure of the master equations related to the sfm@xmath238 $ ] , see above .",
    "the fast dynamics , corresponding to the @xmath7process , determines the thermodynamical noise .",
