    "in the history of hadronic physics the nucleon was one of the first particles to have its internal structure experimentally uncovered .",
    "the nonpointlike character of the nucleon was suggested by the measurements of the proton anomalous magnetic moment . around 1950",
    ", measurements disclosed an exponential falloff for the charge distribution , and three decades later the slac measurements showed that the corresponding charge form factor in momentum space coincided , almost perfectly , with the magnetic dipole form factor .",
    "this image of the proton proved to be a good approximation for low @xmath5 , the square of the four - momentum transfer , and was only superseded by the results from the jlab polarization measurement in 1999 @xcite .",
    "the study of the next baryonic state ( the @xmath0 ) has been more challenging .",
    "although the pure spin 3/2 and isospin 3/2 structure of the @xmath0 was clearly isolated from the background of the pion nucleon scattering experimental cross sections , its theoretical description is not yet totally clear .",
    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) emphasizes the three - quark state component , and historically the existence of the @xmath6 led to the introduction of color as a quantum number .",
    "still , the issue on how much of the @xmath0 structure comes from a three - quark state , and how much is a molecularlike state of a nucleon and a pion , remains an open question .",
    "since the @xmath0 is a spin @xmath7 particle , its electromagnetic structure can be characterized by four form factors , namely the electric charge @xmath1 , magnetic dipole @xmath2 , the electric quadrupole @xmath3 and electric octupole @xmath2 form factors .",
    "the first two describe the charge and magnetic dipole distributions , while the last two measure the deviation of the first ones from the symmetric form @xcite . at zero",
    "transferred momentum squared , @xmath8 , the form factors define the @xmath0 multipole moments : the charge @xmath9 , the magnetic moment @xmath10 , the electric quadrupole moment @xmath11 and the magnetic octupole moment @xmath12 .",
    "if the @xmath0 would simply be a completely symmetric state , with no quark d - states relatively to the quark pair ( diquark ) , both @xmath11 and @xmath12 would vanish @xcite .",
    "the unstable character of the @xmath0 ( with a mean lifetime of 5.6@xmath13 ) makes difficult to probe the electromagnetic properties of this particle / resonance . until recently the available information on the @xmath0 structure came from the study of the @xmath14 reaction only .",
    "the dominance of the magnetic dipole moment in that reaction asserts the spin flip of a quark in the nucleon as the main process , but the magnitudes of the quadrupole contributions ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) indicate a small deformation of the @xmath0 @xcite .    the experimental information on the @xmath0 is restricted to the @xmath6 and @xmath17 magnetic moments @xcite .",
    "even so , those results are affected by considerable error bars , due to the unstable nature of the @xmath0 and theoretical model uncertainties .",
    "this is particularly true for the @xmath18 magnetic moment @xcite .",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite for a review .",
    "new experiments are in progress at mami @xcite to extract @xmath19 more accurately with the help of reaction models based on hadronic degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the scarce experimental information on @xmath10 is compensated by extensive theoretical studies within various frameworks @xcite . for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite . as for other @xmath0 observables",
    ", there is no other information , with the exception of the electric quadrupole moment @xmath11 , which was estimated using a connection to the @xmath14 transition quadrupoles @xcite .",
    "for @xmath20 there is no experimental information related to the @xmath0 form factors .",
    "even a very basic property like the @xmath0 electric charge radius is at present rather unknown , contrarily to what happens for the nucleon , where that quantity is accurately measured @xcite .",
    "our knowledge on the @xmath0 charge radius relies so far only on diverse theoretical model calculations @xcite .",
    "there are also theoretical calculations of the @xmath0 quadrupole moment @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "recently , the nature of the @xmath0 was explored in another direction , and under another light .",
    "lattice qcd , the discrete version of the fundamental nonperturbative theory of the hadrons , was used to estimate the @xmath0 elastic form factors @xcite , following the pioneer works of bernard  @xcite and leinweber  @xcite .",
    "the works @xcite are based on the quenched approximation .",
    "the works @xcite are unquenched calculations , which include also sea quark effects .",
    "the results of the mit - nicosia group @xcite were obtained for a wide range of @xmath5 , while the calculations of the adelaide group @xcite are performed for only one small value of @xmath5 ( the limit case @xmath8 is impossible to reach for technical reasons ) and extrapolated for @xmath8 to obtain the @xmath0 multipoles and the charge and magnetic radii .",
    "in particular for @xmath8 the background field method was used to calculate with a good accuracy the @xmath0 magnetic moment @xcite .",
    "these methods were applied to pion mass values within the 0.3@xmath211 gev region and consequently some extrapolations are required @xcite . in the absence of direct experimental information lattice qcd provides the best reference for theoretical calculations for finite @xmath5 .    motivated by the recent publication of lattice qcd data for the @xmath0 form factors @xcite , several models were also extended to determine those physical quantities .",
    "calculations of the @xmath0 form factors were performed within the covariant spectator theory @xcite and also within a chiral quark - soliton model ( @xmath22qsm ) @xcite .",
    "also , the magnetic octupole moment @xmath12 was estimated by buchmann @xcite , using a deformed pion cloud model , and by geng @xcite , using @xmath22pt . both @xmath11 and @xmath12 were estimated using qcd sum rules @xcite and a covariant spectator quark model @xcite .    in this work",
    "we use a constituent quark model based on the covariant spectator formalism @xcite to predict the @xmath5 dependence of all four @xmath0 multipole form factors .",
    "our results will be compared with the available experimental data , and the results from other models in the literature , as well as with recent lattice data .",
    "the @xmath0 electromagnetic form factors give us an insight into the @xmath0 internal structure .",
    "in particular the determination of the @xmath0 electric quadrupole and magnetic octupole moments gives information on how the @xmath0 is deformed , and on its size and shape .",
    "and this information is valuable , as we will conclude , to adequately constrain quark models .",
    "these in turn can be used to extrapolate and interpret lattice results .",
    "the nucleon , as a spin 1/2 particle , has no electrical quadrupole moment , and the @xmath0 , a spin 3/2 state , emerges as the first candidate for a deformed baryon . a deformation ( compression or expansion along the direction of the spin projection ) would imply @xmath23 .",
    "the interpretation of @xmath23 as a signature of distortion matches well with our intuitive notion of deformation , based on the nonrelativistic limit of the breit frame form factors . in that limit the fourier transformation of the form factors gives the spatial distribution of charge or magnetic moment .",
    "we will therefore identify this notion as _",
    "classical deformation_. recently , an alternative interpretation of distortion , based on transverse densities defined in the infinite moment frame , was introduced by other authors @xcite .",
    "our calculations in this paper provide the basis needed for a forthcoming analysis of the @xmath0 deformation under the _ classical _ perspective and also in the newer perspective @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the study of the @xmath0 form factors is a very interesting topic , even if experimentally arduous .",
    "the only experimental source of information about the @xmath0 deformation comes today from the @xmath14 quadrupole transition . however , this reaction depends on orbital angular momentum components in _ both _ the nucleon and of the @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "it is then very important to have an independent estimate of the angular momentum components in the @xmath0 ( leading to a deformation ) @xcite .",
    "this is the main motive for our focus in this paper on the direct @xmath24 reaction .    in our previous work a first covariant spectator constituent quark model was developed for the nucleon , the @xmath14 transition and the @xmath0 @xcite . in the covariant spectator quark model a baryon is described as a system of three constituent quarks , with a off - shell quark free to interact with a electromagnetic field , while the quark - pair ( diquark ) acts as a spectator on - shell particle .",
    "confinement is described effectively , with a quark - diquark vertex assumed to have a zero at the singularity of the three - quark propagator .",
    "the quarks are dressed , having an electromagnetic form factor with a behavior consistent with vector meson dominance . within this first model we calculated the @xmath0 form factors considering the @xmath0 wave function parameterized simply by an s - wave state for the quark - diquark system . in this case only @xmath1 and @xmath2 have nonzero contributions because of the symmetry assumed for the system . in the work reported here we extend the previous model to the inclusion of the d - states , following ref .",
    "it becomes then possible to predict , without further parameter fitting , nonzero results also for @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "although our results regard only the valence quark contributions , they compare well with a variety of lattice qcd data , besides the available experimental data .",

    "we conclude that valence quark contributions are of the same magnitude as the total result .",
    "this shows that to establish the magnitude of the contributions of the pion cloud to these observables requires more progress , with more accurate quenched and unquenched lattice data . in its absence for the near future @xcite",
