    "the primordial nuclei were formed during the first 20 minutes after the big bang . among them",
    "the lithium isotopes , @xmath6 and a much smaller amount of @xmath0 , were synthesized .",
    "later on , cosmic rays , novae and pulsations of agb stars were the main generators of the @xmath6 isotope , and @xmath0 was formed mainly by cosmic rays . in 1982 , two important papers @xcite for the first time noted that metal - poor ( @xmath7 \\leq-1.4 $ ] ) , warm ( @xmath8 k ) dwarf stars demonstrated remarkably constant @xmath6 abundance ( spite plateau ) , which does not depend on metallicity and effective temperature .",
    "it was quite a surprising observation because depletion of lithium over such a broad temperature range should be significant . because it was impossible to explain the existence of the spite plateau over a wide range of temperatures , it was suggested that no depletion of @xmath6 took place in the observed dwarf warm stars and that the constant abundance of @xmath6 is the primordial one .",
    "however , this interpretation of the spite plateau was periodically challenged .",
    "for example , in @xcite the meltdown of the spite plateau was discovered in some low metallicity stars .",
    "explanation of the lithium abundance in low metallicity stars in the halo of our galaxy where the lithium abundance demonstrates independence on metallicity , forming the spite plateau , became one of the hot topics in modern cosmology / nuclear astrophysics .",
    "note that the observations of the primordial lithium are restricted to white dwarfs because the loosely bound @xmath6 nuclei are easily destroyed by the @xmath9 reaction when the temperature exceeds @xmath10",
    "k. for this reason , red giants can not be used to determine the lithium primordial abundance .    in the standard big bang nucleosynthesis model , @xmath6",
    "is formed right after the big bang , together with @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the primordial reactions start from the deuteron formation @xmath13 .",
    "the deuteron s yield depends on the primordial baryon / photon ratio @xmath14 .",
    "because the deuterons are seeds , which are necessary to synthesize heavier elements , the abundance of heavier elements , and lithium in particular , also depends on @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 and @xmath16 are two primordial nuclei which is most sensitive to @xmath14 .",
    "the abundance of the primordial @xmath6 within the framework of the standard big bang scenario , calculated using the extended reaction network and nine years of wmap results @xcite , is @xmath17 .",
    "it is @xmath18 @xcite based on the planck results @xcite plus the information about the lensing potential and ground - based high resolution experiments .",
    "the latter is considered to be the most up - to - date estimation of the @xmath6 isotope abundance within the standard bing bang scenario .",
    "this abundance remains significantly higher than more recent observations in metal poor halo stars @xcite : @xmath19 .",
    "the shortage of the observed @xmath6 compared to the standard big bang predictions represents the so - called first lithium puzzle .    during the big bang a very small amount of @xmath0",
    "was synthesized via the @xmath1 reaction .",
    "later , @xmath0 was mostly formed by cosmic rays .",
    "the primordial @xmath0 is assumed to be present in the gas from which the stars were formed . unlike most of the other elements ,",
    "when @xmath0 is synthesized inside the stars by hydrostatic nucleosynthesis , it is quickly destroyed .",
    "but in the atmosphere of the halo metal - poor warm dwarfs , the primordial @xmath0 can survive for 13 billion years not being affected by cosmic rays , although its survival can be questioned .",
    "@xmath6 is used to help determine the primordial big bang @xmath0 abundance .",
    "first , the presence of @xmath0 constrains the destruction of @xmath6 , because @xmath0 is more easily destroyed than @xmath6 .",
    "besides , if @xmath0 was formed before the formation of the stars , then the same is true for @xmath6 .",
    "stellar @xmath6 abundance is usually determined from the resonance line at 670.8 nm but in exceptional cases also from the weaker line at 610.4 nm .",
    "the isotope @xmath0 can be detected through the isotopic shift in the li i 670.8 nm line .",
    "the distortion of the line profile is very small and therefore requires very high quality spectra .",
    "@xcite reported for the first time the detection of a high abundance of @xmath0 in very metal - poor stars .",
    "the authors concluded that the observed @xmath0 was formed during big - bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "the detection of @xmath0 was based on the fact noted above , that the presence of @xmath0 in the stellar atmosphere causes an asymmetry in the li 670.8 nm line .",
    "the average @xmath20 isotopic ratio in the nine stars , in which @xmath0 was detected , was @xmath21 @xcite . such a high isotopic ratio of the primordial lithium isotopes in the metal - poor stars contradicts the big - bang based model predictions @xmath22 @xcite and can not be explained by the galactic cosmic rays .",
    "this disagreement between the observations and big bang predictions of the lithium isotopic ratio constitutes the second lithium problem .",
    "later it was pointed out in @xcite that the line asymmetry caused by convection in the photospheres of metal - poor stars is practically indistinguishable from the asymmetry produced by a weak @xmath0 distortion of a symmetric @xmath6 line .",
    "hence , the @xmath0 abundance obtained in @xcite could be significantly overestimated , and the result obtained in @xcite can be considered only as an upper limit of the lithium isotopic ratio . in ref .",
    "@xcite the lithium isotopic ratio was reanalyzed within the framework of the 3d , non - local thermodynamic equilibrium ( nlte ) model .",
    "the authors came to the conclusion that  the observational support for a significant and non - standard @xmath0 production source in the early universe is substantially weakened by our findings \" @xcite , which opens a way to a hope that the primordial abundance of @xmath0 calculated in the standard big bang nucleosynthesis can be eventually reconciled with observational data .",
    "the yields of the observed and predicted primordial @xmath6 are established quite well @xcite .",
    "if the observed @xmath0 is primordial ( a big bang product ) then its abundance is determined by the @xmath1 reaction .",
    "the first successful attempt to measure the @xmath1 reaction was reported in @xcite where residual @xmath0 nuclei were detected .",
    "the astrophysical factor was measured in the vicinity of the first resonance @xmath23 at the relative @xmath24 energy @xmath25 mev and at higher energies . but",
    "no data were obtained at big bang energies , @xmath26 kev . in @xcite the astrophysical @xmath27 factor was also measured only at the resonance energy , using in - beam spectroscopy .    in ref .",
    "@xcite for the first time , an attempt was made to measure the astrophysical factor at the big bang energies , using the coulomb breakup of @xmath0 at @xmath28 mev / a energy on a @xmath29 target .",
    "however , only an upper limit was established .",
    "the failure of this indirect attempt to measure the @xmath27 astrophysical factor could be anticipated because the @xmath30 transition , which usually dominates , is suppressed in the case under consideration : the effective charge for the dipole transition is very small owing to practically the same charge / mass ratio for @xmath31-particle and deuteron . because the coulomb dissociation cross section is dominated by the @xmath32 transition ,",
    "the obtained data may be considered only as an upper limit .",
    "after that , another unsuccessful attempt to measure the @xmath27 factor ended with an upper limit @xmath33 mevb and a pessimistic conclusion that it would be impossible to measure directly @xmath27 at big bang energies @xcite .",
    "the second attempt to use the indirect coulomb dissociation technique was made in @xcite , where the breakup of @xmath0 ions at @xmath34 mev / a on a @xmath29 target was measured .",
    "however , in this case , the breakup was dominated by nuclear breakup , which overwhelmed the coulomb breakup . hence , no information about @xmath27 was extracted from the analysis of the breakup data .",
    "further , in ref .",
    "@xcite the astrophysical factor was calculated using a two - body potential model ( see below ) .",
    "finally , after almost 25 years of failed attempts to measure the @xmath1 reaction at the big bang energies , just recently the luna collaboration presented the first successful measurements at two different big bang energies @xcite .",
    "definitely it is a remarkable achievement in the studies of big bang nucleosynthesis .    in this work",
    "we discuss the astrophysical @xmath35 reaction within the framework of the potential approach and impact on experimental measurements . for the first time , we present the angular distribution of the photons emitted in this direct radiative capture . although the photon differential cross section is being derived for the @xmath35 process , it can be applied for any direct electric radiative capture reaction .",
    "the calculated angular distributions provide the best kinematics to be used in the measurement of the emitted photons , which differ from the one used in the luna experiment .",
    "optimal kinematics will allow one to decrease significantly the uncertainty of direct measurements of the @xmath35 process compared to the uncertainties in the luna experiment . by integrating the differential cross section over the photon solid angle ,",
    "the total cross section and astrophysical factor of the direct radiative capture are derived .",
    "the calculations of the photon s angular distribution and astrophysical @xmath27 factor are done in the potential model using the well determined asymptotic normalization coefficient for the virtual decay @xmath3 .",
    "the primordial @xmath0 abundance is presented .",
    "in this section the expression for the angular distribution of the photons emitted in the @xmath36 direct radiative capture is derived and further simplified in the subsequent section .",
    "this result can help to improve future experiments on this reaction by decreasing their uncertainties .",
    "often photon angular distributions are not discussed in the papers dealing with measurements of the astrophysical factors .",
    "that is why we believe it is timely to do it .",
    "besides by integrating the photon differential cross section over the photon s solid angle the total cross section and the astrophysical factor can be derived .",
    "we consider the photon angular distribution taking into account the spin - orbit interaction in the initial state .",
    "hence , the initial scattering wave function depends on the initial @xmath37 relative orbital angular momentum @xmath38 , the channel spin @xmath39 and the total angular momentum in the initial channel @xmath40 . in the case under consideration",

    "the bound - state woods - saxon potential should be adjusted to obtain the experimental @xmath37 binding energy ( well - depth procedure ) . however , there are infinite number of such potentials because there are three fitting parameters : geometrical parameters , radius and diffuseness , and the well depth",
    ". the final adjustment can be done using the spectroscopic factor .",
    "the two - body potential model was also used in @xcite . to find the @xmath37 bound - state wave function",
    "the woods - saxon potential was adjusted to fit the experimental @xmath39-wave elastic scattering phase shift and to reproduce the experimental @xmath37 binding energy .",
    "since the experimental elastic scattering phase shift includes the many - body effects of the scattered nuclei , the same is true for the two - body potential , which fits the elastic scattering data .",
    "hence , the spectroscopic factor in eq .",
    "( [ radbstwfas1 ] ) should be set to @xmath210 . however , there is again infinite number of the woods - saxon potentials , which differ by the most crucial quantity - the anc ( the inverse scattering problem theorem by gelfand - levitan - marchenko @xcite ) .",
    "the potential adopted in @xcite was one of the infinite set of the phase - equivalent potentials with the anc , which exceeds the experimental anc @xcite and _ ab initio _",
    "calculations @xcite by @xmath211 .",
    "hence , the normalization of the peripheral part of the @xmath199 factor calculated in @xcite exceeded the correct one by @xmath212 .",
    "all these questions about ambiguity of the two - body bound - state potentials were addressed in details in @xcite .    the first full microscopic 6-body approach to calculate the final state @xmath0 bound - state wave function",
    "was developed in @xcite using the variational monte carlo method .",
    "the projection of the @xmath0 on the two - body channel @xmath213 has correct tail with the anc close to the experimental one @xcite .",

    ", we have to introduce in eq .",
    "( [ singlparwf1 ] ) the spectroscopic factor @xmath221 .",
    "this method is referred to as @xmath222 .",
    "the second method is similar to the one described in @xcite . in this method ,",
    "referred to as @xmath223 , the woods - saxon potential used in @xcite was modified to generate the bound - state wave function with correct asymptotic behavior . in this case",
    "the spectroscopic factor is @xmath224 , that is , the overlap function @xmath219 and bound - state wave function @xmath225 do coincide at all radii .",
    "thus , both used overlap functions have the same asymptotic behavior being different in the internal region . in both methods the initial @xmath60 scattering wave function is generated by the woods - saxon potential from @xcite .",
    "its parameters are adjusted to reproduce the experimental phase shifts in the partial waves @xmath195 : the radial parameter is @xmath226 fm , diffuseness @xmath227 fm , the depth of the potential @xmath228 mev . at @xmath229",
    "this potential reproduces the @xmath214 resonance . to calculate the bound - state and scattering wave functions and the radial matrix elements we used the modified radcap code @xcite .",
    "the calculated photon angular distributions for the @xmath231 direct radiative capture using both methods , @xmath222 and @xmath223 , are shown in fig [ fig_angdistr ] for 4 different big bang energies , @xmath232 and @xmath233 kev .",
    "as one can see , the dipole differential cross section has the peak at @xmath234 .",
    "the quadrupole transition has two peaks , at @xmath235 and @xmath236 .",

    "note that in the experiment performed by luna @xcite the germanium detector was placed at a @xmath234 angle with respect to the ion beam direction . at this angle",
    "the differential cross section is significantly smaller than at the peak value at @xmath237 .",
    "another important conclusion is that both methods , @xmath222 and @xmath223 , give practically indistinguishable results confirming that at low energies the reaction @xmath231 is completely peripheral .",
    "it means that only the tail of the @xmath37 bound - state wave function contributes to the reaction matrix element .",
    "hence , to calculate the reaction matrix element it is enough to use any reasonable bound - state woods - saxon potential , which supports @xmath39-wave @xmath37 bound state with the @xmath238 mev binding energy , and then to introduce a proper spectroscopic factor to provide correct normalization of the asymptotic term of the overlap function .",
    "in fig . [ fig_sfactor ] the experimental and calculated astrophysical @xmath27 factors for the reaction @xmath239 are presented .",
    "in contrast to the differential cross section , the total astrophysical factor is given by the sum of the dipole and quadrupole astrophysical factors and does not contain their interference term .",
    "the potential model used in the present calculations with two different bound - state wave functions has been described in section [ potential model1 ] .",

    "the validity of the potential model at higher energies can be easily explained . at",
    "energies higher than big bang energies the quadrupole transition dominates . owing to the presence of the factor",
    "@xmath240 the quadrupole radial matrix element is dominantly peripheral in the energy interval up to @xmath241 mev .",
    "hence , the used here potential model with correct normalization of the tail of the overlap function @xmath219 given by the anc allows one to calculate the astrophysical factor in the broad energy interval @xmath242 mev .",
    "note that the calculations from @xcite and @xcite at big bang energies are higher then presented here .",
    "for example , at @xmath243 kev , which is the most effective big bang energy , @xmath244 mev nb @xcite , @xmath245 mev nb @xcite and the present result is @xmath246 mev nb .",

    "the accuracy of the long wavelength approximation in the case under consideration is quite high : a replacement of @xmath247 in the integrand of the radial matrix elements ( [ matrelemitm1 ] ) by @xmath248 , eq . ( [ o11 ] ) , for @xmath128 and @xmath249 , eq .",
    "( [ o21 ] ) , for @xmath129 changes the astrophysical factor by only @xmath250 .",
    "note that two data points obtained by luna were extrapolated in @xcite to other energies using calculations in @xcite .",
    "the calculations in this paper using the method @xmath223 are similar to calculations from @xcite but performed with a different , more accurate code @xcite .",
    "hence the reaction rates calculated here and in @xcite also agree .",
    "these reaction rates are significantly lower than the adopted reaction rate from @xcite and systematically lower than the reaction rate adopted by nacre @xcite . for example , at @xmath251 , which corresponds to @xmath252 kev , the adopted nacre reaction rate exceeds the calculated one in @xcite by about @xmath253 .",
    "evidently that the present paper and luna s estimations of the big bang abundance of @xmath0 based on the reaction rate of the @xmath1 coincide . for the baryon - to - photon ratio @xmath254 , which is within the interval determined by the planck collaboration @xcite , the calculated primordial abundance of @xmath0 is @xmath255 @xcite which is @xmath256 lower than the abundance given in @xcite .    in the latest comprehensive analysis of the big bang nucleosynthesis",
    "the primordial abundance of @xmath0 was determined to be @xmath257 ( planck baryon - to - photon ratio was adopted ) @xcite and @xmath258 ( wmap baryon - to - photon ratio was taken into account ) @xcite . as we see , the central values of both results are twice as high as luna and present estimations . in both works",
    "@xcite the nuclear reaction rate from @xcite was used claiming that this reaction rate was obtained from the @xmath0 coulomb breakup .",
    "however , it was clearly stated in @xcite that the attempt to determine the @xmath27 factor from the coulomb breakup failed and that a potential two - body model was used to calculate @xmath27 , which turns out to be @xmath259 higher than our and luna astrophysical factors @xcite because a too large value of the anc was used in @xcite .",
    "hence , the second claim in @xcite that the calculated astrophysical factor in @xcite and experimental luna astrophysical factor @xcite  agree well \" is also questionable and one of the reasons of high values of the @xmath0 primordial abundance obtained in @xcite is that the adopted reaction rates for the @xmath1 were based on results from @xcite .",
    "thus , by now the primordial abundance of @xmath0 has been established quite accurately .",
    "taking into account the latest estimate of the @xmath6 abundance @xmath260 obtained from the most recent data on the @xmath261 reaction rate @xcite , the resulting isotopic ratio is @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this isotopic ratio is also the result of the present paper .",
    "the obtained from the luna experiment and indirect anc method the big bang lithium isotopic ratio is lower than the previous estimates : @xmath262 @xcite and @xmath263 @xcite . however , invoking the reaction rate following from the present paper ( or from @xcite ) and @xcite will bring the result obtained in @xcite closer to our and luna estimations .",
    "the established primordial lithium isotopic ratio is by three orders of magnitude lower then the upper limit determined from the lithium observational data in poor - metal , warm dwarf stars what constitutes the second lithium puzzle .",
    "however , the recent publication in ref .",
    "@xcite brings a hope that improving the accuracy of the observational @xmath0 data can resolve this puzzle without involving non - standard physics .",
    "the analysis of the primordial @xmath1 reaction is presented .",
    "first , the general expression for the angular distribution of the photons and specifically for the reaction under consideration is derived .",
    "after that the expressions for the total cross sections for the electric dipole and quadrupole transitions are obtained .",
    "the calculated photon s angular distribution , which takes into account the electric dipole and quadrupole transitions and their interference , exhibits the peak at @xmath237 .",
    "it provides a recipe for the best experimental kinematics .",
    "note that at the first direct measurements performed by luna [ 21 ] , the germanium detector was placed at a @xmath234 angle with respect to the ion beam direction , at which the cross section is significantly smaller than at the peak value .",
    "new measurements with a better geometry can significantly improve the accuracy of the data .",
    "also the experimental and calculated @xmath27 astrophysical factors are presented .",
    "nice agreement between the luna data at two big bang energies and the potential model calculations based on the anc proves the power of the anc method .    the obtained primordial lithium isotopic ratio in @xcite and here @xmath5 is a very important result in understanding of the second lithium problem . in resolving this puzzle",
    "one needs to reconcile both the big bang model prediction of the lithium isotopic ratio and the observational data or to explain their three orders of magnitude difference .",
    "the better the accuracy of the big bang @xmath264 isotopes abundance prediction and the better the agreement with the observational data , the less there will be room for speculations .",
    "the results published by luna and in this work , @xmath5 , sets up quite a strong limit on the primordial isotopic ratio from the big bang model .",
    "the uncertainty of this ratio is contributed by only @xmath265 uncertainty of the @xmath6 abundance @xcite and by @xmath266 uncertainty of the @xmath0 primordial abundance @xcite .",
    "one of the main conclusions from our work is that the determined optimal kinematics can significantly improve the accuracy of the @xmath1 astrophysical s - factor and , hence , the standard bing bang @xmath0 abundance .",
    "but even existing predictions of the big bang isotopic ratio @xmath5 puts quite a strong upper limit and much more accurate than the observational data .",
    "it looks like such a low value of the big bang lithium isotopic ratio makes the second lithium problem even more difficult to resolve .",
    "however , in @xcite the lithium isotopic analysis in four halo metal - poor stars was revisited using , for the first time , a combined 3d and nlte modeling technique .",
    "this upgraded model systematically reduces the @xmath264 isotopic ratio in all four analyzed stars significantly weakening validity of data requiring a significant non - standard primordial @xmath0 production source .",
    "hence , it is too early to discuss the compatibility of the big bang isotopic ratio @xmath20 , which follows from the latest data on the @xmath1 and @xmath267 big bang reactions , and the observational data of the lithium isotopic ratio in halo , metal - poor , warm stars until the observational analysis will be improved significantly . at least , the work published in ref .",
    "@xcite brings a new hope that the second lithium problem can be resolved without invoking non - standard physics .",
