    "the nucleon electromagnetic form factors are fundamental quantities , of great theoretical and experimental importance .",
    "the issue of their determination has been revisited in recent years , thanks to the results of several experiments at bates , mami , jlab , which put under question previous analyses based on less precise data and urged the necessity for a new parameterization and a new analysis of the form factors themselves ( for a review , see , for example refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "a precise knowledge of the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon is important for the determination of the axial nucleon form factor in charged current ( cc ) quasielastic neutrino - nucleon scattering @xcite and strange form factors of the nucleon in neutral current ( nc ) elastic neutrino - nucleon scattering .",
    "for example , nc vector form factors which characterize elastic nc scattering are given by the following expressions  @xcite : @xmath5 in the above the dominant terms are the electric ( @xmath6 ) and magnetic ( @xmath7 ) form factors of the nucleon .",
    "their precise knowledge is essential in order to determine the small strange form factors of the nucleon @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "hence , it is obvious that not only a good knowledge of the electromagnetic form factors is required , but also the present level of their uncertainty .    in this paper",
    "we performed new fits of the nucleon electromagnetic form factors .",
    "the proton ones are extracted from : i ) elastic @xmath10 cross section data , ii ) polarization data , providing the @xmath11 ratio ( @xmath12 being the magnetic moment of the proton ) .",
    "the neutron form factors are extracted from electron - nucleus ( typically deuterium and @xmath13he ) scattering processes .",
    "the latest experimental data are used .",
    "the proton form factors determined from the measurements of polarization transfer in elastic electron - proton scattering ( first appearing between 99 and 02 ) were in a significant disagreement with respect to the ones obtained from elastic @xmath1 scattering data via the customary rosenbluth separation .",
    "the main suggestion to solve this inconsistency was to account for two photon exchange ( tpe ) diagrams @xcite , which should affect the cross section to a greater extent than the polarization data .",
    "this disagreement became even more evident after the new jlab data on @xmath1 scattering cross sections @xcite appeared .",
    "hence , as already pointed out by several authors ( see e.g. @xcite ) , a reliable global fit must include the tpe correction ; we will explicitly show the effect of tpe on the goodness of the fit ( gof ) .",
    "for a recent review devoted to tpe correction see ref .",
    ".    there exist several parameterizations of the nucleon form factors which have been considered in the literature  @xcite . among these ,",
    "the older ones have a purely empirical @xmath14 dependence  @xcite : @xmath15 the specific form of the parameterization may depend on the @xmath14 region .",
    "for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite the low-@xmath14 data were analyzed with form factors given by a continued fraction parameterization : @xmath16 the newest empirical form factors are constrained to have a proper physical behavior at low-@xmath14 as well as at high-@xmath14 .",
    "one of the examples is the kelly s parameterization  @xcite , which will be employed in our analysis ( see next section ) .",
    "the form factors depend on powers of the invariant @xmath14 , and for large @xmath14 the form factors behave like @xmath17 . in ref .",
    "@xcite kelly s parameterization is additionally constrained to satisfy duality hypothesis and the low-@xmath14 behavior is described as in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the electric neutron form factor , usually , is separately treated and described with a smaller number of parameters  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it is also worth mentioning those parameterizations obtained on the basis of the vector meson dominance model .",
    "in particular the parameterization proposed by lomon  @xcite seems especially suited to successfully describe the neutron form factor data .    in the present paper",
    "we aim to provide reliable fits of both proton and neutron e.m .",
    "form factors , by employing a relatively small number of parameters ; moreover one of the major merits of this work is the analysis of errors on the parameters of the fit , which allows one to estimate the present uncertainty on our knowledge of the electromagnetic form factors .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we consider the proton form factors , by analyzing both the polarization data ( section [ polarization ] ) and the cross section data ( section [ cross section ] ) .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the neutron form factors , separately considering the electric and the magnetic form factors .",
    "finally section 4 presents a discussion of our results in comparison with previous analyses and the conclusions .",
    "in section  [ polarization ] we consider the recent polarization transfer and asymmetry measurements data which give an information on the ratio of the electric and magnetic proton form factors .",
    "then , in section  [ cross section ] , we present the results of the combined fit of the polarization and cross section data .",
    "in this section we consider the direct determination of the ratio of the electric and magnetic proton form factors @xmath18 which has been obtained with the measurement of the polarization of the recoil proton and with asymmetry measurements . here",

    "@xcite , the magnitude of tpe is _ fitted _ to the data and , in the elastic cross section , it can be comparable to the magnitude of @xmath65 .",
    "hence the inclusion of the polarization data ( which are less affected by tpe correction ) allows a more precise determination of the tpe fit parameters , but restricts the @xmath14 range to the one of the available polarization data .",
    "it is worth mentioning that by excluding the tpe correction ( hence using for the cross section formula ( [ cross_section_1pe ] ) ) both fits worsen , particularly in the goodness of fit . for the fit",

    "we noticed that this result stems from the presence , in the analysis , of the very accurate jlab data @xcite , without which gof would increase to @xmath116 and @xmath117 , respectively .",
    "in addition to the above discussed form factors , we also checked a different parameterization , based on a two - poles formula for both the electric and magnetic proton form factors  @xcite : @xmath118 with respect to kelly s parameterization this would offer the advantage of having a smaller number of parameters , in addition to the ones of the tpe correction .",
    "a new , global fit , can be obtained with @xmath119 but @xmath120 , thus indicating that the former parameterization is preferable .    as it has been already mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "one of our main tasks is to compute the form factor uncertainties as they can be extracted from the fit .",
    "this goal can be achieved by performing an accurate error analysis on the various fit parameters .",

    "since we have 8 parameters in fit i and 10 parameters in fit ii , the exploration of the parameter space in order to find the contours defined by eq .",
    "( [ contour ] ) can not be done with the simplest grid method .",
    "therefore , we used a monte carlo markov chain generator of random points , which allows to find the allowed parameter regions with good accuracy in a few hours of cpu time of a normal pc .",
    "it is interesting to notice , that the estimated values of the magnetic form factor parameters , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 are strongly correlated . in particular , the estimates of @xmath130 and @xmath131 are almost linearly dependent .",
    "these parameters determine the asymptotic behavior of @xmath132 , which turns out to be : @xmath133 in fair agreement with the one given by the usual dipole form factor ( [ dipol ] ) ( the above uncertainties are at @xmath48 ) .    in fig .",

    "one can see that kelly s fits of the magnetic proton form factor lies within our @xmath48 c.l .",
    "region in almost the whole @xmath14 range under consideration .",
    "for the electric form factor the fits differ by more than @xmath48 in a relatively wide range of @xmath14 .",
    "a similar error analysis is performed for fit  ii . here , the number of form factor parameters is larger ( 4 parameters for each form factor ) .",
    "similarly as above we show contour plot for the tpe correction parameters ( fig .",
    "[ fig_contour_tpe_r ] , right panel ) .",
    "analogously to the case of fit  i the estimates of the parameters @xmath126 and @xmath129 are linearly dependent and their ratio is similar : @xmath134 one could also derive from the form factor parameters the charge and magnetic root - mean - square radii for the proton , as given by the slope of the electric and magnetic form factors at @xmath135 .",
    "they turn out to be : @xmath136 .",
    "these results are comparable with previous analysis in the literature , but slightly lower than the most recent and advanced estimates of ref .",

    "for example ref .",
    "@xcite provides @xmath137 .",
    "the present fit of the form factors is carried out in plane - wave approximation and low-@xmath14 properties like charge and magnetic radii are not properly reproduced without accounting for radiative corrections to the rosenbluth cross sections .    in fig .",

    "the results from fit  i are also plotted .",
    "both fits lead to very similar magnetic form factors .",
    "on the contrary , there is a visible difference between the corresponding electric form factors : the @xmath65 obtained in fit  i decreases faster then the one obtained in fit  ii .",
    "[ ratio - fit - new ] shows the ratio @xmath0 obtained with the fits i and ii .",
    "the linear ratio fitted only to the polarization data is no longer shown , since it is very similar to the one obtained with fit  i. the ratio uncertainties are larger for the fit  ii than for fit  i due to the fact that the parameterization in fit  ii contains a larger number of degrees of freedom .",
    "finally , given for granted that they are necessary , it is interesting to understand which is the _ quantitative _ impact of the tpe correction : they are expected to be relevant especially for the electric form factor . for this purpose",
    "we compare in fig .",
    "[ gmp_and_gep_with_and_withot_tpe ] the proton form factors obtained with and without tpe correction  only fit  ii is considered .",
    "the magnetic proton form factor obtained without tpe is systematically shifted down by about 1.5% , and above @xmath138 gev@xmath3 it lies outside the @xmath48 c.l .",
    "region of the form factor obtained by including the tpe correction .",
    "the analogous effect on the electric form factor is shown in the middle panel of the same figure and appears to be less uniform than for the magnetic form factor : this can be better appreciated from the bottom panel of fig .  [ gmp_and_gep_with_and_withot_tpe ] , where the ratio @xmath139 is plotted .",
    "one can see that the tpe correction substantially alters the @xmath14 dependence of the electric form factor , in particular , for @xmath140  gev@xmath3 , with an effect which grows up to the order of 10% .",
    "in any case the impact of the tpe correction turns out to be non - negligible for both form factors .",
    "the measurement of the neutron form factors is much more difficult than that of the proton form factors , since a target of free neutrons does not exist .",
    "the neutron form factors are extracted from measurements of electron - nucleus scattering , usually electron - deuteron or electron - helium scattering .",

    "@xcite and differs from our , in particular in the treatment of the systematic uncertainties .",
    "in particular we usually obtain asymmetric uncertainties around the best fit value : hence in fig .",
    "[ fig_comparison_of_errors ] we compare the errors of arrington and sick on the electric and magnetic proton form factors with our lower and upper bounds for the @xmath48 confidence level errors . for the magnetic proton form factor , within the @xmath48 c.l .",
    "our results are consistent with the ones of ref .  @xcite .",
    "for the electric proton form factor we notice some deviations between our results and the ones obtained by arrington and sick .    in conclusion",
    "we have presented two fits of the proton and neutron electromagnetic form factors , using the best available data .",
    "the @xmath1 elastic cross sections were reproduced by including a simple but realistic parameterization of the two photon exchange correction .",
    "alternative parameterizations with fewer parameters than the one employed here do not allow to obtain equally good fits .",
    "we show that the impact of the tpe correction on the magnetic and electric proton form factors is larger than the @xmath48 uncertainty of the fits ( in a wide range of @xmath14 ) .",
    "in fit  i we constrained the electric proton form factor by the ratio @xmath0 extracted from recoil polarization and asymmetry data .",
    "fit  ii employs kelly s parameterization with four parameters both for the electric and magnetic proton form factors .",
    "this fit is obtained with two additional parameters with respect to fit  i , however we believe that it is more reliable than the former , particularly in the low @xmath14 region .",
    "we also performed a careful analysis of the uncertainties resulting on the parameters of the fit and hence on the form factors .",
    "it is worth stressing that only a few papers , among the many devoted to the nucleon electromagnetic form factors , include the tpe correction in the analysis . as a final remark",
    "we remind the reader that even small uncertainties in the magnetic form factors of the proton and neutron turn out to be important for a correct analysis of the neutrino - nucleon cross sections .",
    "the numerical results of our fits are available in the web site @xcite .",
    "the authors acknowledge fruitful discussions with e. l. lomon and t. w. donnelly . k.  m.  g. thanks ron gilman for his remarks on the previous version of the manuscript , which helped to improve the present one .",
