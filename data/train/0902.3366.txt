    "recent experiments with bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) driven by a far off - resonant laser beam have demonstrated collective superradiant rayleigh @xcite and raman scattering @xcite , sharing strong analogies with the superradiant emission from excited two - level atoms @xcite . in these experiments an elongated bec scatters the pump photons into the end - fire modes along the major dimensions of the condensate , acquiring a momentum multiple of the two - photon recoil momentum @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the wave vectors of the pump and the scattered field .",
    "theoretical works have shown that the superradiant rayleigh scattering relies on the quantum collective atomic recoil ( qcarl ) gain mechanism , in which the fast escape of the emitted radiation from the active medium leads to the superradiant emission @xcite .",
    "the quantum regime of carl @xcite occurs when the two - photon recoil frequency @xmath4 is larger than the gain bandwidth , such that the recoil frequency shifts the atoms out of resonance inhibiting further scattering processes . as a consequence in the qcarl each atom coherently",
    "scatters a single pump photon , changing momentum by @xmath5 .",
    "the process in which the atoms make a transition between two momentum states ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) has strong analogies with that of two - level atoms prepared in the excited state and decaying to the lower state by spontaneous and stimulated emission .",
    "however , the incoherent spontaneous emission dominating the two - level atomic decay is absent in the momentum transition , where spontaneous emission is associated to momentum diffusion due to the scattering force , which can be made very small if the laser is sufficiently detuned from the atomic resonance .",
    "the absence of doppler broadening and the long decoherence time of a bec allows to observe superradiance and coherent spontaneous emission much more easily than from electronic transitions in excited atoms , in which the decay is dominated by the incoherent spontaneous emission .",
    "another example of cooperative phenomena from excited two - level atoms is subradiance , i.e. the cooperative inhibition of spontaneous emission by a destructive interatomic interference .",
    "this phenomenon , whose existence has been proposed by dicke ( 1954 ) in the same article predicting superradiance @xcite , has received less consideration than the more popular superradiance , also due to the difficulty of its experimental observation . in fact , the only experimental evidence has been done on 1985 by pavolini _",
    "_ @xcite . among different schemes of multi - level systems",
    "in which subradiance was predicted , crubellier _ et al .",
    "_ , in a series of theoretical papers @xcite , proposed a three - level degenerate cascade configuration in which cooperative spontaneous emission is expected to exhibit new and striking subradiance effects .    in this paper we show that subradiance in a three - level degenerate cascade can be realized in a bec inserted in a ring cavity and lightened by two laser fields with frequency difference twice the two - photon recoil frequency , as illustrated by fig.[fig1 ] .        the frequency of the scattered photon is determined by energy and momentum conservation .",
    "the process consists in two steps . in the first step",
    "the atoms initially at rest scatter the laser photons of frequency @xmath8 into the cavity mode of frequency @xmath9 , changing momentum from @xmath10 to @xmath11 . in the second step",
    "the atom scatters the laser photon of frequency @xmath12 changing their momentum from @xmath13 to @xmath14 .",
    "since the change of the kinetic energy of the atom is @xmath15 , by energy conservation the frequency of the scattered photon is @xmath16 which coincides with the frequency generated in the first step when @xmath17 . in this way a three - momentum - level degenerate cascade is realized in which the atoms , initially with momentum @xmath18 , change momentum to the intermediate value @xmath0 and then to the final value @xmath19 , emitting two degenerate photons of frequency @xmath9 . in general the process , as described in ref.@xcite , will continue with an other scattering of the photon of frequency @xmath12 changing the atomic momentum from @xmath19 to @xmath20 with the emission of a photon of frequency @xmath21 and so on .",
    "however , if the cavity linewidth is much narrower than the frequency difference , @xmath22 , these other frequencies will be damped out .",
    "then , the oscillation of only the frequency @xmath9 in the cavity will restrict the momentum cascade to the three momentum states , @xmath10 , @xmath0 and @xmath19 .",
    "a basic feature of this system is that the transition rates are proportional to the pump intensities , so that they can be varied with continuity .",
    "this makes the subradiance observation much easier than with a three - level cascade between electronic energy levels , where the transition rates are fixed by the branching ratios .",
    "the quantum collective atomic recoil laser ( qcarl ) with a two - frequency pump is described by the following equations for the order parameter @xmath23 of the matter field and the cavity mode field amplitude @xmath24 @xcite : @xmath25\\psi\\label{es}\\\\",

    "the emitted frequency @xmath30 is within the cavity frequency linewidth , whereas the pump field is external to the cavity so that its frequencies are not dependent on the cavity ones .",
    "the order parameter @xmath47 of the matter field is normalized such that @xmath48 .",

    "if the cavity linewidth @xmath46 is smaller less than @xmath59 , only the photons with frequency @xmath30 will survive in the cavity . since further scattering would generate photons with frequencies @xmath60 , with @xmath61 , which can not oscillate in the cavity , then the hilbert space of the atoms",

    "notice that the second transition rate , from @xmath56 to @xmath58 , is proportional to the two pump amplitude ratio , @xmath68 .",
    "asymptotically , in a time much longer than @xmath69 , the photons leak the cavity and the total polarization in eq.([a3:2 ] ) vanishes : @xmath70 on resonance ( @xmath71 ) and with the atoms initially at rest ( @xmath72 ) , the variables @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 are real and eqs.([c0:2])-([a3:2 ] ) keep invariant the following quantity : @xmath77 from it we see that the atoms can not populate completely the final state @xmath58 ( with @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) unless @xmath80 .",
