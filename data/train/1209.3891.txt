    "however , this calculation has been done with @xmath158 and lepton number violation in the sneutrino mass matrix leads to the mass splitting between the real and the imaginary part of the lightest sneutrino , and the scattering via z boson exchange occurs inelastically , through a transition from the real to the imaginary or viceversa .",
    "points shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : gendd ] ) have all very small splitting in the sneutrino sector , but if the mass splitting is greater than some kev , scattering is strongly suppressed at direct detection experiments .",
    "indeed , the maximum kinetic energy that the sneutrino lsp can transfer to the detector depends on the velocity it moves relative to the nucleus @xmath159 ( @xmath160 in the galactic halo),the nucleus mass m and the angle @xmath161 of scattering :    @xmath162    where @xmath163 , which would give , in the case of a xenon detector for instance , and @xmath164 gev , e = 25 kev ( if cos(@xmath161 ) = 0 ) . for heavier sneutrinos with a mass of the order of tev",
    ", for a splitting larger than some hundred kev the direct detection cross section goes to zero .",
    "such `` large '' splitting is currently not excluded in the inverse seesaw , compare to fig .",
    "( [ fig : split ] ) .",
    "thus , in principle inverse seesaw can evade all constraints from direct detection , while linear seesaw can not , see the discussion in section ( [ subesct : linss ] ) .      in this subsection",
    "we discuss the dm phenomenology of the supersymmetric @xmath42 extension of the standard model .",
    "the main difference to the simpler models discussed previously are the presence of the extra gauge boson @xmath0 and the possibility to have an additional light , mostly singlet higgs boson , which lead to some important changes in the phenomenology .",
    "first , recall that the @xmath43 gauge symmetry of this model is spontaneously broken to the hypercharge group @xmath165 by the vevs @xmath166 and @xmath167 of the scalar components of the @xmath168 and @xmath169 superfields whereas the @xmath170 breaking is driven by the vevs @xmath171 and @xmath172 of the neutral scalar components of the @xmath173 higgs doublets @xmath174 and @xmath19 up to gauge kinetic mixing effects .",
    "the tadpole equations for the different vevs can be solved analytically for either ( i ) ( @xmath175 , @xmath176 ) or ( ii ) ( @xmath177 , @xmath178,@xmath179 ) or ( iii ) ( @xmath180 , @xmath181 , @xmath178 , @xmath179 ) @xcite .    we address the minimal version option ( i ) as cmblr ( constrained mblr ) , since it allows to define boundary conditions for all scalar soft masses at @xmath67 , reducing the number of free parameters by four , although leading to some constraints on the parameter space , such as a lower bound on tan@xmath182 ( tan@xmath183 ) @xcite . the second option ( ii ) is instead more flexible , and we have made use of it in some of our scans , too .",
    "we will refer to this option as @xmath74mblr version ( non - universal @xmath74 masses mblr ) .",
    "we have not used the last option , which we only mentioned for the sake of completeness .",
    "the result of @xmath127 for two general scans is shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : blrdmgenvr ] ) .",
    "parameters have been scanned as described in the figure caption .",
    "note that there are two fixed but different choices of @xmath69 in the left and right plots , leading to two different values of the @xmath0 mass . in both plots in fig .",
    "( [ fig : blrdmgenvr ] ) the main feature clearly visible is the @xmath0 pole .",
    "indeed , the annihilation of the @xmath151 lsps into sm particles via the @xmath0 becomes efficient when the mass of the @xmath151 is close to half the mass of the @xmath0 .",
    "the mass of the @xmath0 can be calculated analytically @xcite and mainly depends on the value of @xmath69 , see eq.([eq : mzp ] ) .",
    "the atlas searches for a @xmath0 set a lower limit on its mass which is 1.8 tev , and this translates into a lower limit on @xmath184 tev , see the plot on the left .",
    "the plot on the right shows that choosing a higher value of @xmath69 we can get very heavy @xmath151 dm with the correct ra , up to masses of several tev .    the main annihilation channels for sneutrino dm for the points of fig .",
    "( [ fig : blrdmgenvr ] ) are shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : brblrdmgenvr ] ) .",
    "far from the @xmath0-pole resonance these are @xmath101 ( magenta ) , @xmath102 ( brown ) , @xmath185 ( orange ) , @xmath104 ( red ) , @xmath186 ( purple ) , @xmath187 ( blue ) , @xmath188 ( green ) .",
    "the quartic coupling with two higgses ( @xmath189 , @xmath190 and @xmath191 , depending on if they are kinematically allowed , depending on the @xmath151 mass ) is one of the most efficients , as before . for lower masses the annihilation via",
    "the mssm higgs is the most efficient , as can be noticed by the small relic density for lower masses , expecially in the first plot , where on the left end side we are approaching the region where the quartic higgs coupling is important ( for @xmath192 gev ) .",
    "recall that in this model the higgs sector is more complicated due to the extended gauge structure .",
    "the @xmath193 breaking results in one additional light higgs , @xmath190 @xcite .",
    "the mixing between the mssm higgs @xmath189 and the @xmath190 enhances the mass of the mostly mssm higgs , leading to a mssm - like higgs in accord with the most recent atlas and cms preferred regions , without much constraints on the susy spectrum .",
    "however , this enhancement of the mssm higgs mass occurs usually in the model if the @xmath190 has a mass of the order of the mssm - like state or less , i.e. the presence of a light singlet higgs is preferred unless the susy spectrum is rather heavy ( in which case the cmssm limit is reached ) .",
    "direct detection cross section ( in @xmath194 ) for sneutrino lsps in the blr model .",
    "masses are in gev .",
    "black points refer to the scan described in fig.([fig : blrdmgenvr ] ) left with @xmath195 tev .",
    "blue points stand for the scan of fig.([fig : blrdmgenvr ] ) right with @xmath196 tev .",
    "all points shown fulfill the ra constraints .",
    "higher @xmath69 leads in general to lower dd cross section . ]",
    "we have also checked for constraints coming from direct detection in the limit of negligible sneutrino splitting .",
    "examples for direct detection cross section are shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : blrdd ] ) .",
    "as before , see fig.([fig : gendd ] ) , different experimental constraint are also shown .",
    "all points shown fulfill the constraints from relic abundance .",
    "we have calculated two scans , one with @xmath195 tev ( black ) and one with @xmath196 tev ( blue ) . as can be seen ,",
    "practically all of the points with @xmath195 tev in this scan are excluded by the limit from xenon-100 , while most of the @xmath196 tev are allowed .",
    "thus xenon-100 puts currently a lower bound on @xmath69 ( and thus the @xmath0 mass ) of the order of @xmath197 tev for sneutrino lsps as dm .",
    "the origin of this surprisingly strong constraints lies in the @xmath198 mixing .",
    "the mixing angle between these two states is roughly of the order @xmath199 .",
    "thus the right sneutrinos , which couple mostly to the @xmath0 , couple via this mixing also to the @xmath75 .",
    "the @xmath75 has an experimentally fixed mass .",
    "thus , the only possibility to suppress the dd cross section is to increase @xmath69 .        finally , fig .",
    "( [ fig : lowsnu ] ) shows a dedicated scan for low mass sneutrinos in the mblr model .",
    "the different curves are slight variations of the parameters near the study point blrsp1 .",
    "the original parameters of blrsp1 were : @xmath200 , @xmath201 , @xmath202 , @xmath123 , @xmath203 , @xmath204 , @xmath205 and @xmath206 gev .",
    "to obtain very light sneutrinos , @xmath54 has been lowered to @xmath207 gev , while the different curves are for @xmath208 and @xmath209 gev and the scanning runs @xmath72 from @xmath210 gev .",
    "the resulting scan produces sneutrinos with masses in the interval [ @xmath211 gev , while the lightest higgs mass , in this case a mostly singlet higgs , has a mass eigenvalues of @xmath212 gev .",
    "the figure shows a pole around @xmath213 gev , due to a mass for the mssm - like higgs of around @xmath214 gev in all cases .",
    "there appear additional dips in the ra for smaller sneutrino masses , whenever @xmath215 .",
    "this demonstrates that in the extended gauge model it is possible to have the correct ra even for very low sneutrino masses .",
    "however , note that , while the model can in principle give dd cross section large enough to explain the dama @xcite , and cogent @xcite hints , such points will always be inconsistent with the constraints from xenon-100 @xcite , also for the case of inelastic dark matter @xcite .",
    "we have studied low scale seesaw models with a sneutrino lsp .",
    "we considered two possibilities : models with the mssm gauge group and either a linear or inverse seesaw and a model with the gauge group @xmath39 and an inverse seesaw .",
    "sneutrinos can be the dm in both cases , fulfilling all known experimental bounds .    however , while inverse and linear seesaw lead to different results for lfv , in general , they give similar dm results .",
    "there are some differences in detail , though : in the inverse seesaw it is possible to avoid all direct detection constraints using a large enough splitting in the sneutrino sector , which leads to `` inelastic '' dark matter .",
    "this is not possible in the linear seesaw , due to constraints from neutrino physics .    in the extended gauge model",
    "there is more freedom than in the simpler mssm - group based models .",
    "especially very light ( @xmath216 gev ) or very heavy ( @xmath217 tev ) sneutrinos can give the correct relic density , due to the existence of a mostly singlet higgs in the former case and due to the @xmath0 in the latter .",
    "very light sneutrinos could explain the hints from dama @xcite or cogent @xcite , but are inconsistent then with xenon-100 @xcite .",
    "finally , it is interesting to note that in the limit of small sneutrino mass splitting the dd limit from xenon-100 @xcite leads to a lower limit on @xmath69 of the order of @xmath218 tev for sneutrino lsps as the dominant component of the galactic dark matter .",
