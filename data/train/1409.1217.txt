    "the emission mechanism that produces gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) is not yet well understood  @xcite .",
    "high - energy ( gev - pev ) neutrinos may also be produced in grbs , and their detection would help reveal the emission processes in relativistic grb jets  @xcite . additionally , high - energy neutrino observations probe the contribution of grbs to the observed cosmic ray flux  @xcite , and are used in multimessenger searches with , e.g. , gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "the search for neutrinos from grbs is one of the primary goals of existing and planned high - energy neutrino observatories .",
    "the most sensitive , recent grb - neutrino analyses , carried out using the icecube detector  @xcite , already provide meaningful constraints on the neutrino emission  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there has been no confirmed detection of grb - neutrinos so far .",
    "given the small predicted flux , the focus of grb - neutrino searches has been to maximize the number of detectable neutrinos , by stacking data for a large number of grbs and by considering an extended time window around grbs in which neutrinos are looked for .",
    "in the latest icecube analysis @xcite , the search time window included the interval between the earliest and latest reported gamma - ray emission .",
    "additionally , a _ model - independent _ analysis was carried out for neutrinos within @xmath2day around each grb .",
    "the most recent flux estimates for grbs predict a relatively low number of detected neutrinos compared to earlier calculations  @xcite . considering the standard fireball - internal shock model , hmmer _ et al . _",
    "@xcite obtains the expected tev - pev neutrino flux from observed grb properties by numerically modeling the emission process , allowing for a detailed microphysical analysis .",
    "they find that constraining the grb emission parameters will require an extended , multi - year observation with icecube .",
    "an alternative grb emission scenario with significant neutrino production is sub - photospheric dissipation of relativistic grb jets by the proton - neutron collisions  @xcite .",
    "this model , which robustly reproduces the observed grb photon spectrum , also predicts the emission of @xmath3gev neutrinos  @xcite that could be detectable by icecube and its low - energy extension deepcore  @xcite over a period of a few years  @xcite . with these grb - neutrino rate estimates , the extended searches required for detection will also have a significant contribution from atmospheric background neutrinos .",
    "therefore , it can be critical to use all available information about the emission process to better identify astrophysical neutrinos by improving the signal to noise ratio ( see , e.g. , @xcite for improved stacking methods ) .",
    "both gamma - rays and neutrinos are expected to be produced in relativistic outflows ( jets ) with typical lorentz factor @xmath4 . due to this relativistic expansion and their closely connected production mechanism",
    ", gamma - ray and high - energy neutrino fluxes will be temporally correlated in the observer frame .",
    "for instance , internal shocks in relativistic outflows can accelerate both protons and electrons .",
    "these protons lose some of their energy to pion production , emitting high - energy neutrinos , while the electrons can produce the observed gamma - ray emission due to synchrotron or inverse - compton radiation @xcite . in this model",
    ", the emission of neutrinos and gamma - rays will be both synchronous with the internal shock in the observer frame .",
    "the temporal correlation also applies for cases in which the emission region is different , e.g. , for photospheric gamma - ray emission , as long as the jet front is also relativistic . in this case ,",
    "energy dissipation in the jet below the photosphere produces both neutrinos and an @xmath5 plasma , and the latter radiates its energy in gamma rays after reaching the photosphere . since the dissipation region advances relativistically , there will be essentially no delay between the produced neutrinos and gamma - rays in the observer frame .",
    "we note that mildly relativistic jets , or jets that are still beneath a stellar envelope , may produce high - energy neutrinos that precede the observable gamma - ray emission  ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "another exception is temporally extended @xmath3gev gamma - ray emission , which can be connected to @xmath6pev neutrino emission to which icecube is less sensitive for sources towards the northern hemisphere @xcite .",
    "while these are also promising sources of neutrinos , in the following we focus on the @xmath3mev gamma - ray emission from luminous grbs for which there is no appreciable delay .",
    "this lack of delay enables the use temporal correlation without information on the source structure or its redshift .    in this paper",
    ", we examine whether even a single detected grb - neutrino could be a discovery",
    ". such a single neutrino would allow for the earliest possible detection , without the need to wait for the accumulation of multiple signal neutrinos .",
    "we make use of the temporal correlation expected between gamma - ray and neutrino emission in grbs to show that even one astrophysical neutrino can be highly significant .",
    "grb neutrinos are more likely to be detected when the gamma - ray flux is higher . below we utilize this correlation to associate an increased significance with astrophysical neutrinos by reducing the false alarm rate",
    ".    in general , the expected rate of detected neutrinos , @xmath7 , can depend on the gamma - ray flux @xmath8 as well as other properties of the grb , e.g. , the photon power spectrum and redshift . in the following , we assume @xmath9 . to justify the use of this proportionality , we consider the neutrino emission estimates of hmmer _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who calculated the neutrino fluence and spectrum for 117 grbs that were used for a grb - neutrino search with partially completed icecube  ( 40-strings ; @xcite ) , covering a 1-year observation period and grbs in the northern hemisphere . to calculate the expected number @xmath10 of ( muon ) neutrinos detected by icecube , we take the effective area of the full icecube detector ( for muon neutrinos arriving from a declination @xmath11 ; @xcite , which is more conservative than using a direction dependent effective area ) .",
    "we find that the obtained @xmath10 values for the 117 grbs can indeed be characterized by the grb fluences @xmath12 , following the proportionality @xmath13 with coefficient of determination @xmath14 .",
    "this shows that @xmath12 is a good predictor of @xmath10 . for an actual grb - neutrino search",
    ", one can adopt the calculated @xmath10 for each grb in the analysis , which can further increase the advantage of assigning neutrino significance based on the measured grb flux .    with @xmath9 ,",
    "a natural choice of the neutrino test statistic is @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the observed grb flux at the time @xmath17 of the detected neutrino , @xmath18 is the reconstructed direction of the neutrino , and @xmath19 is the direction dependent atmospheric background neutrino detection rate . in the following , for simplicity",
    ", we neglect the directional dependence of @xmath19 , and consider @xmath16 as the neutrino test statistic ( see , e.g. , @xcite for the weak directional dependence of the background rate ) . adopting this test statistic , one can calculate the p - value of an observed neutrino .",
    "consider a set of grbs that are the subject of the analysis .",
    "for each grb , one can identify a time interval within which neutrinos are searched for , e.g. , @xmath20 , during which @xmath21 of the gamma - ray fluence is observed .",
    "let @xmath22 be the total observation duration for all grbs combined .",
    "the p - value of an observed neutrino that is temporally coincident with @xmath16 gamma ray flux can then be defined as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the duration during which the observed gamma - ray flux was within @xmath25 $ ] for all grbs considered .",
    "the above test statistic can be used to filter out background neutrinos by requiring a low false alarm rate ( far ) for the search using a threshold flux @xmath26 . to assess the sensitivity of the test statistic , here",
    "we quantify the false dismissal rate ( fdr ) as a function of @xmath26 .",
    "first , let us consider the simple case in which @xmath8 is precisely known for all grbs , i.e. if background fluctuations were negligible . in this case",
    ", the fdr corresponding to @xmath26 is simply related to the total gamma - ray fluence integrated over fluxes below @xmath26 : @xmath27 = \\frac{\\mbox{fdr}_0}{s_{\\rm total}}\\int_{f_{0}}^{f_{\\gamma}^{\\rm min } } \\frac{\\partial t(f_{\\gamma}')}{\\partial f_{\\gamma } ' } f_{\\gamma } '   df_{\\gamma } ' , \\label{fdr}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the maximum rate of false dismissal ( i.e. if all neutrinos were dismissed ) , @xmath29 is the total fluence of the grbs in the analysis , and for the no - fluctuation case the minimum considered fluence can be chosen as @xmath30 .    the presence of noise , however , complicates this estimate .",
    "let the measured flux be @xmath31 , with @xmath32 being the real grb flux and @xmath33 the random background flux drawn from a normal distribution with 0 mean and @xmath34 standard deviation .",
    "the background can be estimated from the observed flux before and after each grb , therefore we assume that the mean of the noise is 0 , and the standard deviation is known during the bursts .",
    "consider now the background - only case with @xmath35 .",
    "the average measured flux in this case will be @xmath36 , since we exclude the highest values from the average above the threshold @xmath26 . to ensure that the background fluence estimate will be 0",
    ", we can modify the sub - threshold fluence estimate in eq.([fdr ] ) by taking @xmath37 .",
    "we can calculate this new fluence estimate as a function of the ( unknown ) grb flux : @xmath38 with @xmath39 , is accurate for the background , but it still underestimates the grb flux ; one can see that @xmath40 .",
    "this bias , nevertheless , is only significant for threshold values that are comparable to the background fluctuations , and our estimate will be correct for greater thresholds ( see below ) .",
    "to determine the connection between fdr and far , we use the light curves of the 583 grbs detected by swift - bat prior to december 2013 .",
    "we use their light curves during the time periods identified by the detector to be within the grbs @xmath20 .",
    "we estimate the grbs fluence by integrating their flux , which is an underestimate of their actual flux given the limited sensitive energy band of swift - bat ( 15kev@xmath41@xmath42@xmath41350kev ) .",
    "we bin the data within 5-s intervals ( see below ) . for simplicity",
    ", we use a uniform background uncertainty @xmath33 over the whole data set .",
    "a detailed grb - neutrino search can use different uncertainties for each burst .    for a given far",
    ", it is straightforward to determine the corresponding gamma - flux threshold @xmath26 using eq.([equation : pvalue ] ) , since far@xmath43far@xmath44 .",
    "this threshold in turn is used to estimate the fdr using eq.([fdr ] ) . in fig.[figure : roc ] we show the obtained fdr as a function of far , both normalized to the total number of signal and background neutrinos , respectively , within the considered grb time window . for comparison , we also show the dependence of @xmath26 on far .",
    "one can see that , as expected , far decreases much faster than fdr , i.e. one can significantly improve the significance of detected astrophysical neutrinos with relatively little loss .    to determine the precision of the fdr estimate",
    ", we find a conservative upper limit on fdr by considering a uniform grb flux distribution between @xmath35 and @xmath45 .",
    "this uniform distribution gives an overestimate of the fdr compared to any realistic grb flux distribution that is a decreasing function of the flux . to see that this is indeed an upper limit , consider a data point with @xmath32 flux from the grb .",
    "the probability of this data point falling within @xmath46 is @xmath47 ( defined above ) .",
    "the average contribution of this data point to the fdr is @xmath48 , and the discrepancy between the actual and identified falsely dismissed fluxes is @xmath49 .",
    "this contribution increases from @xmath50 up to @xmath51 , and then decreases afterwards .",
    "consequently , among grb flux distributions that do not increase with @xmath32 , the largest discrepancy is obtained for uniformly distributed fluxes .",
    "fig.[figure : roc ] shows this upper limit for fdr by taking the measured @xmath52 and accounting for the potential underestimation assuming uniform flux distribution .",
    "as expected the discrepancy will be small for @xmath53erg@xmath54s@xmath55 for far@xmath56far@xmath57@xmath58 , making eq .",
    "( [ equation : estimate ] ) accurate for this range .",
    "we now examine whether a single grb - neutrino can be a 5@xmath1 discovery if we use all available information to filter out the background .",
    "we implement a monte carlo simulation to obtain the rate and significance distribution of astrophysical neutrinos .",
    "we use an unbinned likelihood ratio search that can be used for grb - neutrino searches , incorporating temporal correlation beyond spectral and directional information .",
    "the steps of the analysis are the following :    ( i ) : :    for a neutrino detected at time @xmath59 , assign a temporal    signal probability density function ( pdf ) that is proportional to the    observed gamma - ray flux :    @xmath60 . the    temporal background pdf is uniform .",
