    "it is known that there are many remarkable high - energy sources harbored in the galactic center ( gc ) region @xcite .",
    "recently , tev @xmath0-ray emission from the direction of the gc has been reported by three independent groups , whipple @xcite , cangaroo ( collaboration of australia and nippon for a gamma ray observatory in the outback ; @xcite ) , and hess(high energy stereoscopic system ; @xcite ) .",
    "at least four potential candidates are suggested for this tev @xmath0-ray emission , which are the black hole sgr @xmath3 @xcite , the compact and powerful young supernova remnant ( snr ) sgr a east @xcite , the dark matter halo @xcite , and the whole diffusion 10pc region @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the angular scale of the tev source was determined by hess to be less than a few arc - minutes , indicating that this @xmath0-ray source is located in the central @xmath4 region @xcite .",
    "it suggests that the black hole sgr @xmath3 , with a mass of @xmath5 @xcite , should be involved @xcite .",
    "recently , a hadronic origin of tev @xmath0-rays that is linked to the massive black hole has been addressed in detail by @xcite .",
    "they argued that the tev @xmath0-rays are produced indirectly through the processes of @xmath2-decay when relativistic protons are injected into the dense ambient gas environment .",
    "the flux of this radiation component depends on the density of the target , the diffusion speed of protons in the interstellar medium , and the injection rate of protons . as a result , a dense gas target and an extremely large proton flux",
    "is required . however , since the black hole sgr @xmath3 currently only emits faint electromagnetic radiation , it is largely uncertain how the protons could be accelerated to relativistic speeds .",
    "it is well known that jets associated with accretion disks surrounding black holes are efficient in accelerating particles .",
    "for example , tev @xmath0-rays observed from several bl lac objects ( a subclass of active galactic nuclei ) are argued to originate from relativistic jets @xcite .",
    "the jet model is also used to explain the production of tev @xmath0-rays from microquasars @xcite .",
    "however , such a jet model can not be applied directly to the black hole sgr @xmath3 .",
    "an extraordinarily low bolometric luminosity of @xmath6 has been estimated for the black hole through multi - wavelength observations , which indicates that sgr @xmath3 is in its quiescent dim state , and no powerful jet exists at present .",
    "we propose that the black hole sgr @xmath3 could be re - activated and produce a powerful jet by capturing a red giant ( rg ) star , temporarily behaving like an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "this may have happened thousands of years ago , naturally providing a mechanism to generate the proton flux required by the hadronic model of aharonian & neronov .",
    "the structure of our paper is as follows .",
    "the capture process is described in sect.2 .",
    "we estimate the model parameters and the energy of the proton flux available for the production of tev @xmath0-rays in sect.3 .",
    "a brief discussion and conclusion are presented in sect.4",
    "many if not all galaxies are expected to posses a massive black hole @xcite .",
    "it has been thought that the capture and tidal disruption of stars by such a massive black hole could result in flarelike activities in the central regions of agns , and even in normal galaxies and globular clusters .",
    "the flare results from the rapid release of gravitational energy as the matter from the disrupted star plummets toward the black hole @xcite .",
    "this process may even be the mechanism of @xmath0-ray bursts @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the presence of an extended high - temperature plasma at the gc region has been confirmed by advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics ( asca ) observations @xcite , suggesting that the gc exhibited intermittent activities at least 300 yr ago .",
    "we propose that the black hole sgr @xmath3 could have been naturally lit up and produced the currently observed tev @xmath0-rays when it captured a rg star .",
    "the detailed capture and disruption process of a main - sequence ( ms ) star has been studied by several authors @xcite .",
    "syer & ulmer ( 1999 ) also discussed the capture rate of red giant stars by a massive galactic black hole in virialized star clusters . compared with the capture of a ms star , the disruption of a rg star is different in that ( 1 ) rg disruption events generally last much longer , but are relatively fainter ; ( 2 ) the tidal disruption radius of a rg star is typically equal to its pericenter radius ; and ( 3 ) the size of the accretion disk formed in the capture process of a rg is larger .",
    "we believe that the capture of a rg star ( rather than a ms star ) is more appropriate to explain the observed @xmath0-ray emission from the gc ( this problem is further addressed in section 4 ) .",
    "we follow the treatments of syer & ulmer ( 1999 ) to study the capture of a rg star and scale our parameters to the physical conditions in the galactic center .",
    "when a star of mass @xmath7 and radius @xmath8 passes by a black hole with a mass of @xmath9 , the star could be captured at an average tidal radius of @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 . for ms stars , @xmath14 , but for rg stars ,",
    "the radius ranges from @xmath15 to @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the maximum radius of a rg star ( @xmath17 ) is attained only during a short period ( @xmath18 ) of its evolutionary lifetime , so the typical radius of rg stars is actually @xmath19 , and we take @xmath20 in our model .",
    "the capture rate of ms stars by a massive black hole has been discussed by phinney ( 1989 ) , rees ( 1990 ) , and cannizzo et al.(1990 ) .",
    "however , the capture rate of rg stars is more complicated , involving the mass function of stars , stellar evolution , the black hole mass , and the maximum radius of a rg @xcite . by assuming a salpeter mass function for the stars , syer & ulmer ( 1999 ) estimated the capture rate in our galaxy as @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( table 1 in syer & ulmer 1999 ) for mss and rgs , respectively .",
    "once a rg star is tidally disrupted , a fraction of its debris plummets to the black hole .",
    "the time for the debris to return to the pericenter ( @xmath23 ) and the time for it to enter a circular orbit around the black hole ( @xmath24 ) are @xcite @xmath25 @xmath26 respectively , where @xmath27 is the number of orbits necessary for circularization , probably ranging between 2 and 10 .",
    "we assume that the pericenter radius of the captured star equals its capture radius @xcite in the calculations .",
    "after the debris circularization , either a thick torus or a thin disk would be formed around the black hole , depending on two timescales .",
    "one is the time to radiate a significant portion of the energy of the bound debris at the eddington limit ( @xmath28 ) , the other is the time to accrete a large fraction of the disk ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "if @xmath30 , a thin disk will form ; otherwise , a thick torus will appear @xcite .",
    "the former case is necessary to our model , since the jet associated with the accretion disk is efficient to accelerate particles . below",
    "we show that a thin disk will truly be formed in the process that we consider .",
    "the radiation timescale is @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the fraction of the stellar mass that goes into the bounded debris @xcite , @xmath33 is the eddington luminosity , and @xmath34 is the efficiency of transferring the rest mass to radiation energy in the accretion process , which is defined as @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the total radiated disk luminosity , and @xmath37 is the mass accretion rate of the disk . for a rapidly rotating black hole , @xmath38 .    for a standard accretion disk @xcite , the accretion time can be estimated as , @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the radius and height of the disk , respectively , @xmath42 is the viscous constant , and @xmath43 is the keplerian velocity .",
    "the typical values for h / r are in the range @xmath44 to @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "we define @xmath46 and @xmath47 . from eqs.(4 ) and ( 5 ) , we find @xmath48 , thus a thin disk forms in our model .    the lifetime of our galaxy is @xmath49 .",
    "we find that when the black hole captures a ms or a rg star , the relation of @xmath50 is satisfied , where @xmath51 .",
    "this implies that the activity of the black hole triggered by the capture events is intermittent . for the rg star capture",
    ", one long flare can be observed that lasts for @xmath52 .",
    "the time that the black hole becomes bright and active after the rg star capture depends on the evolution of its surrounding accretion disk .",
    "the overall evolution of the accretion rate is illustrated in fig.1 .",
    "initially , the accretion rate of the disk exhibits an abrupt increase , since a local mass clumping in the inner - most orbit of the disk is similar to a delta - function ( rees 1998 ; see fig.1 ) .",
    "this stage will last until the mass accumulation rate of the disk reaches its peak @xmath53 .",
    "we refer to this stage as phase 1 . according to the simulations of evans & kochanek ( 1989 ) , the value of @xmath53 is @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the eddington accretion rate .",
    "when @xmath56 , the accretion rate evolves as @xcite @xmath57 from this point on , the black hole is activated and enters a luminous phase , acting like an agn .",
    "this very active phase will continue until a critical time ( @xmath58 ) when the actual accretion rates falls below a critical value @xmath59 ( beckert & duschl 2004 ; 2002 ) .",
    "we refer to this stage as phase 2 . during this phase",
    ", the radiation efficiency of the accretion disk is very high .",
    "after phase 2 , the accretion rate itself still continues to fall slowly as @xmath60 , but the accretion flow becomes advection dominated .",
    "when advection takes over , the radiation efficiency drops drastically by several orders of magnitude ( at least @xmath61 ; beckert & duschl ( 2002 ) ) , resulting in a switch off of the agn - like phase .",
    "we describe this stage as phase 3 , during which the black hole becomes dim and no longer looks like a quasar .",
    "beckert & duschl ( 2002 ) pointed out that @xmath59 should be less than @xmath62 because no consistent advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) models with @xmath63 are feasible .",
    "however , the exact value for @xmath59 is still uncertain , since it is related to the radiation mechanism that is taking effect during the phase transition @xcite . in our study , we use the observed data to determine the value of @xmath59 . assuming that the transition from phase 2 to phase 3 is triggered by thermal instability of the disk @xcite , the corresponding transition timescale is @xmath64 we see that the transition process is finished almost instantly . note that a faint x - ray source @xcite has been identified at the position of the gc ,",
    "whose infrared radiation is also weak @xcite .",
    "it indicates that the present accretion disk surrounding the black hole sgr @xmath3 is probably adaf @xcite .",
    "these observations also support our idea that the black hole is currently in phase 3 .",
    "the time corresponding to @xmath53 can be estimated from eq.(7 ) as @xmath65 although the jet formation itself is very difficult to model , observations are providing increasing evidence for the existence of powerful collimated outflows in black hole systems @xcite .",
    "we assume that when the black hole sgr @xmath3 evolves from phase 1 to phase 2 , a powerful jet would form , originating at the inner edge of the disk @xcite . for convenience ,",
    "we define a dimensionless parameter @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the total jet power , including the rest energy of the expelled matter .",
    "the value of @xmath68 can range from @xmath69 to @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that most of the black holes in the universe are rapidly spinning @xcite .",
    "recently , by analyzing the light curves of the x - ray and infrared flares from the gc region , the angular momentum of the black hole sgr @xmath3 has been accurately determined as @xmath71 ( aschenbach et al .",
    "the possible mechanism for spinning up this black hole has been discussed by y. liu et al .",
    "therefore , for sgr @xmath3 , the radiation efficiency may be as high as @xmath72 . combining eqs.(7 ) and",
    "( 10 ) , we have @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the total energy of the jet is then @xmath76 the value of @xmath58 is determined in the next section .",
    "in spite of extensive observations , direct evidence for high - energy activities of the gc region , such as those observed in agns , is still lacking . fortunately , strong fluorescent x - ray emission has been found from the cold iron atoms in the molecular cloud at the sgr b2 region ( sunyaev et al .",
    "1993 ; koyama et al .",
    "the most favorable explanation for this emission is that the molecular cloud was once illuminated by intense x - rays from sgr a@xmath1 ( sunyaev & churazov 1998 ; cramphorn & sunyaev 2002 ) . according to this theory ,",
    "the x - ray luminosity of sgr a@xmath1 should have been @xmath77 about 300 yr ago , which was most likely due to the capture of a star by the black hole .",
    "however , observations also show that the current x - ray luminosity of sgr a@xmath1 is only @xmath78 ( koyama et al .",
    "1996 ) . therefore ,",
    "if this explanation is correct , then the luminosity of sgr a@xmath1 has decreased rapidly by a factor of @xmath79 in less than 300 yr .",
    "we note that in our framework , such a rapid dimming is possible only at the time of @xmath58 , when the accretion disk formed by capturing a star transitions from phase 2 to phase 3 .",
    "as stated in section 2.2 , the transition could be finished in a few years ( see eq.(8 ) ) , and the luminosity could decrease by a factor of @xmath79 after the transition .",
    "thus , we suggest that the required luminosity of @xmath80 was just the power of the black hole system when it was approaching the end - point of phase 2",
    ". then the lifetime of the jet can be determined by setting @xmath81 .",
    "the result is @xmath82 combining eqs.(9)and ( 11)-(13 ) and taking @xmath83 , @xmath84 , we obtain @xmath85 if a larger value of @xmath86 is assumed , then the @xmath87 would be even higher .",
    "note that @xmath87 is the total kinetic energy of the jet .",
    "possibly only @xmath88 of it could be converted into high - energy particles .",
    "the energy of the injected protons required by the hadronic origin of tev @xmath0-rays has been modeled by aharonian & nerono ( 2005b ) .",
    "it depends on the diffusion coefficient of protons in the ambient gas .",
    "generally , the dependence of the diffusion coefficient on proton energy can be expressed as @xmath89 , where @xmath90-@xmath91 @xcite and @xmath92 to @xmath44 @xcite are dimensionless parameters .",
    "there are mainly three typical propagation scenarios , characterized by different @xmath93 and @xmath94 values @xcite .",
    "the case of the effective confinement of protons ( ecp ) corresponds to @xmath95 and @xmath96 , the kolmogorov type turbulence ( ktt ) corresponds to @xmath97 and @xmath98 , and the bohm diffusion ( bd ) corresponds to @xmath99 and @xmath100 . for photons with a typical energy of 10 tev ,",
    "the diffusion coefficient is @xmath101 for ecp , @xmath102 for ktt , and @xmath103 for bd .",
    "assuming that the injection of protons lasts for @xmath104 , the required injection energy by the hadronic origin of the tev @xmath0-rays in these three cases can be estimated as @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the required injection rate of protons corresponding to the three diffusion mechanisms , which is @xcite , @xmath107 comparing eq.(15 ) with eq.(14 ) , and taking into account the efficiency ( @xmath108 10% ) of converting @xmath87 into cosmic rays , we find that the required energy could be satisfactorily provided by our rg star capture model in at least two diffusion cases , i.e. , the ecp and ktt diffusion . in fact , if we assume @xmath109 , then the jet energy would also be enough for the bd mechanism .",
    "note that the linear size of the tev source is likely to be only @xmath110 ( aharonian et al .",
    "we now further check which propagation scenario can meet this requirement .",
    "theoretically , the protons would diffusion to a radius of @xmath111^{1/2}$ ] @xcite , where @xmath112 is the diffusion time of the injected protons when they propagate in the target . in our case , @xmath113 .",
    "for the three diffusion mechanisms , the radius of the source is , @xmath114 eq.(17 ) shows that for both bd and ktt propagation scenarios , the corresponding radius is obviously too large as compared with observation . on the contrary , in the case of the ecp propagation scenario , we obtain @xmath115 ,",
    "then the linear size is @xmath116 .",
    "it is in good agreement with the observed size of the tev source .",
    "we thus believe that the ecp diffusion is taking effect in our framework .    in short",
    ", our analysis shows that the capture of a rg star by the black hole sgr @xmath3 could be the energy source of the observed tev @xmath0-ray emission from our gc .",
    "the energy deposited in this way is large enough to produce a relativistic outflow of protons .",
    "the outflow could diffuse into a volume with the diameter of @xmath110 .",
    "the detailed process that transfers the energy of the injected protons into that of observed @xmath0-rays has been discussed by other authors ( aharonian et al .",
    "2004 ; aharonian & neronov 2005b ) , and is not addressed repeatedly here .",
    "a strong tev @xmath0-ray source has been detected at the galactic center , whose size is probably less than 10 pc .",
    "it should be closely related to the black hole sgr a@xmath1 of our galaxy .",
    "aharonian & neronov ( 2005b ) suggested a hadronic origin for these @xmath0-rays ; i.e. , they are produced through @xmath2-decay process when a strong flow of relativistic protons interacts with the dense ambient gas .",
    "however , the nature of this proton flow is largely unknown . in this paper",
    ", we show that the required proton outflow could have been reasonably produced when the black hole sgr a@xmath1 captured a rg star and formed an accretion disk around it in the past .",
    "the whole process can be divided into three phases . in phase 2 , which lasts for @xmath117 yr",
    ", the black hole becomes active and luminous thanks to a relatively high accretion rate , temporarily behaving like an agn .",
    "a relativistic outflow of protons can be ejected in this phase , whose total energy is as high as @xmath118ergs , large enough to meet the requirement of the aharonian & neronov model .    according to our calculations ,",
    "the propagation of protons in the target gas is through the ecp scenario .",
    "we show that the injected protons have diffusiond into a volume of @xmath119 , consistent with the observationally inferred size of the tev source .",
    "furthermore , when the 10 tev protons diffuse in the target gas , their escape time is comparable with the characteristic time of proton - proton interactions , implying that the spectrum of the observed tev @xmath0-rays should be similar to that of the injected protons @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath0-ray spectrum observed by hess is , @xmath120 @xcite , we can conjecture that the initial spectrum of the injection protons should be @xmath121 .",
    "aharonian & neronov ( 2005b ) pointed out that the cutoff energy is @xmath122 .    in our study , we mainly consider the case in which the captured star is a rg star . if the captured star is a ms one , things will be much different . in table 1 , we have listed the key quantities calculated for a ms star capture , comparing them directly with those of a rg star capture .",
    "interestingly enough , we find that the energy injection by a ms star capture also meets the requirement of energetics .",
    "however , we note that @xmath123 for a ms star ; this means that the jet formed by the capture of a ms star terminates much earlier .",
    "in this situation , the diffusion timescale of the injected protons is @xmath124 , which is much smaller than the diffusion time of a rg capture event .",
    "consequently , within the jet lifetime , the protons originating from a ms star capture will diffusion to @xmath125 which is inconsistent with the size ( @xmath126 pc ) of the tev source inferred from current observations .",
    "this is the main reason that we prefer a rg star capture rather than a ms star capture in our framework .",
    "however , to determine the size of the tev source observationally is not an easy task because of its extended nature .",
    "we note that the hess collaboration has not yet published the final analysis of its observations of the galactic center on larger scales , so there is still a lack of information on tev emission beyond the 10 pc scale at the area .",
    "it is thus possible that the actual size of the tev source may be larger .",
    "in addition , the reduction of tev emission may also be due to the decrease of the density of the gas at larger distances , but not the lack of an ultra - relativistic proton flow .",
    "taking into account these factors , the ms star capture scenario still can not be completely excluded .",
    "in fact , a comprehensive analysis of the tev radiation and a thorough investigation of the environment within @xmath127 pc around sgr a@xmath1 are necessary for us to understand the history of the activities in the gc region .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for valuable comments and suggestions that lead to an overall improvement of this study .",

    "<S> these runaway protons interact with the dense ambient medium , producing tev @xmath0-ray emission through the @xmath2-decay process . </S>",
