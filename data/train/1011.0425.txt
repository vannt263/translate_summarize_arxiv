    "we are conducting measurements of the relative orientations of the rotational and orbital axes in close binary star systems .",
    "our name for this undertaking is the banana project , an acronym chosen to remind us that binaries are not always neatly aligned .",
    "this paper reports our results for the nycephei system , the third system we have studied , the first two having been v1143cygni @xcite and diherculis @xcite .",
    "those two earlier works were written before our project was enlarged and named , and are retrospectively included in this series as papers i and ii .",
    "the goal of the banana project is to enlarge the number of detached binary systems for which the relative orientation of the spin axes is known , in order to shed light on the formation and evolution of binaries and perhaps also of planets .",
    "close binaries and star - planet systems might be expected to have well - aligned orbital and spin angular momenta , since all of the components trace back to the same portion of a molecular cloud . however , good alignment is not guaranteed .",
    "if a cloud is highly elongated , with its long axis tilted with respect to its rotation axis , then the cloud may give birth to binary stars with a strong spin - orbit misalignment @xcite .",
    "alternatively , disks around young stars might become warped during the last stage of accretion .",
    "this warp could torque the orbit by a large angle while maintaining the orientation of the spins @xcite .",
    "more generally , star formation may be a chaotic process , with accretion from different directions at different times @xcite , and perhaps we should not expect the angular momenta of the star and the disk to be as well aligned as they apparently were in the solar system .",
    "there are also processes that could alter the stellar and orbital spin directions after their formation . a third body orbiting",
    "a close pair on a highly inclined orbit can introduce large oscillations in the orbital inclination and eccentricity of the close pair @xcite .",
    "tidal dissipation during the high - eccentricity phases can cause the system to free itself of these `` kozai oscillations '' and become stuck in a high - obliquity state @xcite .",
    "however , if dissipation is sufficiently strong then the system will evolve into the double - synchronous state , characterized by spin - orbit alignment ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , whether a close binary or a star - planet system is well - aligned or misaligned depends on its particular history of formation and evolution . even though this issue is important for a complete understanding of star formation , there has been very little observational input .",

    "the high obliquities are especially common among stars with higher masses and effective temperatures @xcite .",
    "the results of such studies are commonly interpreted as constraints on theories of the `` migration '' processes that presumably brought the planets inward from their more distant birthplaces .",
    "however , some theories invoke processes that produce large stellar obliquities for reasons having nothing to do with the planets , such as chaotic accretion @xcite , and magnetic interactions with the inner edge of the accretion disk @xcite .",
    "although those theories have not been fully developed , it would seem that the mechanisms they propose should also operate in the case of binary stars , and therefore the theories might be tested by measuring the obliquities of binary stars .",
    "for example if interactions with a distant companion are important for close double stars , then this should also be true for star - planet systems .",
    "other effects like tidal realignment do depend on the mass and mass ratio of the close pair . for a direct comparison with the exoplanet hosts",
    ", one would want to survey main sequence f and g binaries , while ( as we will describe ) most of the existing data , including the data presented in this paper , is for earlier type stars .",

    "measuring the orientations of stellar spin axes is not straightforward .",
    "telescopes can not usually resolve stellar disks , causing the information on spatial orientation to be lost .",
    "an optical interferometer , in combination with a high resolution spectrograph , might allow for spatial resolution of rotationally - broadened stellar absorption lines @xcite , but so far such measurements are possible for only the very nearest and brightest systems @xcite .    one would be able to determine the inclinations of the spin axes with respect to the sky plane , based on empirical estimates of the projected stellar rotation speed ( @xmath17 ) , the stellar radius ( @xmath18 ) , and the stellar rotation period ( @xmath19 ) , using the equation @xmath20.\\ ] ] many investigators have pursued this path and found it to be blocked , for reasons described clearly by @xcite .",
    "namely , the quantities @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are difficult to measure with high enough accuracy , and the flattening of the sine function near @xmath21 prevents the method from discriminating even modest inclinations from edge - on inclinations . despite these difficulties",
    ", @xcite used this method to argue that active binaries that are observed to be asynchronously rotating have misaligned spin axes .",
    ".general data on nycephei [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     given a large sample of @xmath17 measurements of stars that have a known distribution of rotation speeds , or that are presumed to have similar rotation speeds ( e.g. , main - sequence stars of a given mass and age ) , it is possible to test for departures from an isotropic distribution of spin directions .",
    "using this idea , @xcite and @xcite searched for , and did not find , a tendency for stars to be preferentially aligned with the galactic plane . when the orbital orientation is also known , as is the case for visual binaries or eclipsing binaries , then such tests give information about spin - orbit alignment .",
    "such studies are worthwhile but they are hampered by the nonlinearity of the sine function ( as mentioned above ) as well as uncertainty in the underlying distribution of rotational speeds , and the heterogeneity in the techniques for measuring @xmath22 .",
    "this method has been used in various guises by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , among others .",
    "recently , @xcite used this method on stars with transiting planets , finding evidence that more massive stars have high obliquities .    indirect evidence on the orientation of young stars comes from the orientation of their disks  assuming star - disk alignment .",
    "the projected rotation angle of the disk can be traced by the linear polarization vector of the star light reflected from the dust grains in disks @xcite . these authors and others ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) find that in most binary systems the disks around the individual stars are aligned with each other .",
    "however they also mention exceptions to this rule .",
    "one of these exceptions is the hierarchical triple system ttauri , for which @xcite and @xcite found that the disk around the northern component , the original ttauri system , is viewed face on , while the disk around one of the southern components ( ttausa ) , separated by @xmath23au from ttaun , is viewed edge - on .",
    "thus this system has misaligned circumstellar disks .",
    "the method that provides the most accurate information for individual systems takes advantage of eclipses . during an eclipse of one star by another star or a planet , part of the rotating stellar surface is hidden , causing a weakening of the corresponding velocity component of the stellar absorption lines .",
    "modeling of this spectral distortion reveals the relative orientation of the spin and orbital axes on the sky : the _ projected obliquity_. this `` rotation anomaly '' was first predicted by @xcite .",
    "a claim of its detection in the @xmath11librae system was made by @xcite , but more definitive measurements were achieved by @xcite and @xcite for the @xmath7lyrae and algol systems , respectively . the phenomenon is now known as the rossiter - mclaughlin ( rm ) effect .",
    "various aspects of the theory of the effect have been worked out by @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the work described in this paper , as well as in the previous papers in this series , is based on the rm effect .",
    "although it has been more than 80 years since its discovery , there are relatively few quantitative analyses of the rm effect observed in stellar binaries .",
    "it is ironic that at present , there are more such papers about exoplanetary systems than about stellar binaries . in the past , observing the rm effect was generally either avoided ( as a hindrance to measuring accurate spectroscopic orbits ) or used to estimate stellar rotation speeds .",

    "column 6 summarizes the results for the stellar obliquities . in most cases we have written ``",

    "there is no good explanation for the misalignment of diher .",
    "broadly speaking , it could be primordial , or it could be the result of an interaction between the stars or between the stars and the disk from which they formed , or it could be due to torques from additional bodies in the system . the results in this paper do not point to a particular mechanism , but they do mean that any successful theory must pass the `` nycep '' test , namely , it must explain the difference between those two systems .",
    "obtaining measurements of spin orbit angles in a number of early type close binary systems might reveal which environmental variables determine the orientation of stellar rotation axes in these systems .",
    "for example if the interaction with a distant companion via the kozai migration @xcite formed close binaries , than misaligned systems should be more likely to have a detected companion and closer systems might be more likely to have misaligned axes than wider systems . if alignment is a simple function of coherence length during star formation , then the opposite should be true : the closer the system , the stronger the tendency toward alignment .",
