    "one of the archetypal fe - based superconductor structures is the `` 122 '' structure : aefe@xmath2x@xmath2 ( thcr@xmath2si@xmath2-type ) , with ae an alkaline earth element ( ca , sr , ba ) an alkali metal ( k , rb , cs ) or eu and x a pnictogen element.@xcite variants of the 122 structure have been widely studied owing to the availability of a wide range of chemical substitutions on different crystallographic sites ( _ e.g. _ , co for fe , k for ba , p for as , etc . ) as well as their tendency to form macroscopic , high - purity crystals .",

    "lines and shaded regions are guides to the eye . ]    unlike the volume collapse transition , the facts about the occurrence of superconductivity in the aefe@xmath2as@xmath2 systems are less clear . with the use of more hydrostatic pressure conditions , researchers have found that the superconducting dome , as defined by complete resistive transitions or susceptibility data , in the parent compounds is generally excluded from the magnetic , orthorhombic phase.@xcite the results on ( ca@xmath0sr@xmath1)fe@xmath2as@xmath2 are consistent with this finding even with the less hydrostatic steatite pressure - transmitting medium used in this study . however , it is imperative to note that a study using he as the pressure - transmitting medium revealed the _ absence _ of superconductivity in both the orthorhombic ( magnetic ) _ and _ the collapsed tetragonal phases of cafe@xmath2as@xmath2.@xcite a simple , quantitative shift in the pressure at which superconductivity appears as a function of hydrostaticity would not be entirely surprising , but the qualitative difference ( _ i.e. _ , a complete lack of superconductivity ) as a function of pressure media creates a conundrum regarding the appearance of superconductivity in the aefe@xmath2as@xmath2 systems .    while the generic phase diagrams of chemical substitution and doping look strikingly similar , there are subtle differences that question the roles of structural and magnetic instabilities and suggest that a one - to - one correspondence between pressure and substitution is too simple .",
    "studies of electron- and hole - doped bafe@xmath2as@xmath2 have revealed a splitting of the nominally coupled paramagnetic - antiferromagnetic and tetragonal - orthorhombic phase transitions with increasing dopant content.@xcite superconductivity is seen to develop within the antiferromagnetic , orthorhombic phase with both co and k substitution in bafe@xmath2as@xmath2,@xcite but the optimal @xmath4 is achieved within the paramagnetic , uncollapsed tetragonal phase . though superconductivity develops within the antiferromagnetic state , the suppression of that state , at least to some degree , seems to be a necessary ingredient for superconductivity . unlike doping of the bafe@xmath2as@xmath2 end member , rh - doping into cafe@xmath2as@xmath2 does not reveal a significant splitting of the paramagnetic - antiferromagnetic and tetragonal - orthorhombic phase transitions , but @xmath9 is nonetheless suppressed with increasing doping.@xcite superconductivity is seen only in the paramagnetic , uncollapsed tetragonal phase , and the onset of a doping - induced collapsed tetragonal phase destroys superconductivity .",
    "recently , a doping study using rare earth ( re ) elements in ca@xmath35re@xmath36fe@xmath2as@xmath2 has shown that the components of electron doping and chemical pressure can be effectively separated , and that each of these components plays a different role in manifesting superconductivity.@xcite within the ca@xmath35re@xmath36fe@xmath2as@xmath2 series , superconductivity occurs in either the uncollapsed or collapsed tetragonal phases , but not within the antiferromagnetic , orthorhombic phase .",
    "assimilating the doping- and pressure - dependent phase diagrams of the 122 systems in order to better understand the nature of the high - temperature superconductivity seen therein is a challenging problem .",
    "given the overwhelming evidence that electron- or hole - doping plays an important role in the development of superconductivity within the chemically substituted aefe@xmath2as@xmath2 systems and given the occurrence of strain - induced superconductivity in srfe@xmath2as@xmath2,@xcite it is tempting to posit that the small superconducting dome seen under pressure may be a product of some effective doping induced by non - hydrostatic pressure conditions , possibly resulting not only from the pressure - transmitting medium but from the volume collapse transition itself .",
    "alternatively , without high - fidelity , low - temperature structural data under pressure , it is difficult to exclude structural phase inhomogeneity ( _ e.g. _ , coexistence of the collapsed and uncollapsed tetragonal phases ) as a possible cause of the proximity of superconductivity to the observed structural instabilities",
    ". more work demarcating the @xmath34 lines in srfe@xmath2as@xmath2 and bafe@xmath2as@xmath2 under pressure may help to illuminate any possible connections between pressure - induced superconductivity and the isostructural volume collapse .",
    "the compound ( ca@xmath0sr@xmath1)fe@xmath2as@xmath2 under pressure behaves intermediate between its two end member parent compounds . with applied pressure , the concomitant structural / magnetic transition is suppressed with no evidence favoring a splitting of the two nominally coupled transitions .",
    "the afm , orthorhombic phase is abruptly cut off by an isostructural volume collapse resulting in a collapsed tetragonal phase .",
    "the volume collapse transition is driven by the development of as - as bonding across the mirror plane of the crystal structure , contracting the @xmath7-axis of the unit cell and likely affecting the fe - as bonding and potentially the magnetic state of the fe atoms .",
    "the collapsed tetragonal phase supports superconductivity with a maximum @xmath4 near 22 k. there is no obvious structural parameter that defines the magnitude of @xmath4 , but the proximity of the superconducting phase to the suppression of magnetism as well as the onset of the collapsed tetragonal phase suggests that magnetic interactions and/or structural inhomogeneity may both play a role in the development of pressure - induced superconductivity in these systems .",
