    "i will therefore neglect non - perturbative effects associated with the hadronization scale @xmath2 . from the location of the rise of the cross section a precise measurement of the top quark mass will be possible , while from the shape and the normalization of the cross section one can extract the top quark yukawa coupling @xmath5 ( for a light higgs ) , the top width or the strong coupling . in the past",

    "although it involves summations of the terms proportional to @xmath9 . it can be implemented systematically using the factorization properties of non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd )  @xcite .",
    "the nnlo qcd corrections to the total cross section were calculated some time ago in ref.@xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the corrections were found to be as large as the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd corrections , and from the residual scale dependence in the nnlo result , the normalization of the cross section was estimated to have at least @xmath16 theoretical uncertainty.@xcite it was concluded that the top quark mass in a threshold mass scheme can be determined with a precision of @xmath17  mev or better from the shape of the cross section.@xcite however , the large nnlo qcd corrections to the normalization of the cross section jeopardized competitive measurements of the top width , strong top coupling , or the top yukawa coupling .",
    "moreover , the large nnlo corrections seemed to indicate that , despite the perturbative nature of the @xmath18 system , high precision computations might not be feasible .",
    "the determination of higher orders would be necessary to clarify the feasibility of the fixed - order approach .",
    "figure[figtopplots]a shows the vector - current - induced cross section @xmath19 at lo , nlo and nnlo in fixed - order perturbation theory for typical choices of parameters and renormalization scales .",
    "( top threshold production mediated by the axial vector current is suppressed by @xmath20 and small and not relevant here for the discussions on the convergence of the perturbative expansion .",
    "see e.g. refs.@xcite . )",
    "one way to understand the large scale uncertainties and the large size of the fixed - order nnlo qcd corrections is to recall that the perturbative @xmath18 threshold dynamics is governed by vastly different energy scales , the top mass ( @xmath21gev ) , the top three - momentum ( @xmath22gev ) and the top kinetic or potential energy ( @xmath23gev ) .",
    "this hierarchy of scales is the basis of nrqcd factorization@xcite , which separates hard and non - relativistic effects , and which can be implemented in the fixed - order scheme shown above .",
    "however , in fixed - order perturbation theory nrqcd matrix elements involve logarithmic terms such as @xmath24 which can not be rendered small for a single choice of the renormalization scale @xmath25 .",
    "for example , since @xmath26gev , one finds @xmath27 for @xmath28 which is of order unity , and fixed - order perturbation theory becomes unreliable .",
    "moreover , at higher orders , fixed - order perturbation theory can not distinguish the scale at which to evaluate @xmath12 .",
    "mistaking an @xmath29 for an @xmath30 is a difference of a factor of two .",
    "both problems can not be addressed systematically within the framework of fixed - order perturbation theory .",
    "but they can be avoided in a framework that allows for renormalization group improved perturbative computations , where _ all _ logarithmic terms are summed through renormalization group equations .",
    "thus a better expansion should have the schematic form @xmath31 where the indicated terms are of leading logarithmic ( ll ) , next - to - leading logarithmic ( nll ) , and next - to - next - to - leading logarithmic ( nnll ) order .",
    "i have used the expression `` better expansion '' because in qcd computations one should favor expansion schemes where logarithmic terms are summed into coefficients and not contained in isolated form in matrix elements .",
    "this is even true in cases where the non - logarithmic corrections are sizeable too , because possible cancellations between large logarithmic and large non - logarithmic terms can be unphysical . to accomplish a renormalization group",
    "improved calculation one needs to employ a more sophisticated effective field theory approach than the one that is used for the fixed - order computations .    in this talk",
    "i give a basic introduction to `` velocity nrqcd '' ( vnrqcd )  ref.@xcite ( for a review see also ref.@xcite ) , which is an effective theory for heavy non - relativistic quark pairs that , through renormalization , sums all logarithms involving ratios of the scales @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath35 .",
    "the program is similar in spirit to let s say summing qcd logarithms of @xmath36 for the electroweak hamiltonian describing b - quark decays .",
    "however , in the non - relativistic case the program is more complicated because the structure of the relevant degrees of freedom in the effective theory action is more involved and because the two low energy scales @xmath37 and @xmath38 are correlated through the heavy quark equation of motion @xmath39 . at first sight",
    "it seems impossible to keep this correlation of scales and to render the logarithms in the effective theory matrix elements shown in eq.([logarithms ] ) small ( which is equivalent to saying that all logarithms are summed into wilson coefficients of the effective theory ) . in the effective theory",
    "this problem is dealt with by using two renormalization group scales in the effective lagrangian : @xmath40 for soft ( @xmath41 ) fluctuations and @xmath42 for ultrasoft ( @xmath43 ) fluctuations .",

    "both renormalization scales are related by @xmath46 .",

    "all renormalization group equations of the effective theory are expressed in terms of @xmath49 . running from @xmath50 to @xmath51 , where @xmath13 is the typical top quark velocity , sums all logarithms of @xmath13 and minimizes both @xmath44 and @xmath45 in the matrix elements .",

    "i will briefly discuss the status of top pair production at threshold .",
    "the physical system we wish to describe is that of a heavy quark and antiquark with mass @xmath57 , and energies @xmath58 , and momenta @xmath59 in the c.m.system where @xmath60 .",
    "the degrees of freedom from which we have to build the effective action can be identified from the relevant momentum regions that can be found in an asymptotic expansion of non - relativistic scattering diagrams in the c.m.frame.@xcite the regions include hard modes with momenta @xmath61 , soft modes with momenta @xmath62 , potential modes with momenta @xmath63 and ultrasoft modes with momenta @xmath64 .",
    "fluctuations with off - shell momenta are integrated out because they do not resonate , while for modes that can resonate fields are introduced from which we build the effective lagrangian . resonating heavy quarks can only live in the potential regime , while massless modes can live either in the soft or the ultrasoft regime .",
    "thus , the effective lagrangian is build from heavy potential quarks and antiquarks ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) , soft gluons , ghosts , and massless quarks ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 ) and ultrasoft gluons , ghosts , and massless quarks ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 ) .",
    "the ultrasoft gluons are the gauge partners of momenta @xmath43 , while soft gluons are the gauge partners of momenta @xmath41 .",
    "this classification is , of course , only meaningful in the c.m.frame for a non - relativistic heavy quark - antiquark pair .",
    "double counting is avoided since ultrasoft gluons reproduce only the physical gluon poles where @xmath73 , while soft gluons only have poles with @xmath74 .",
    "it is essential that both soft and ultrasoft gluons are included at all scales below @xmath57 because the heavy quark equation of motion correlates the soft and ultrasoft scales .",
    "we will also see later in sec.[sectionanomdim ] , when i show new results for the 3-loop ( nnll ) anomalous dimension for the @xmath18 production current , that both soft and ultrasoft running can in general feed into anomalous dimensions induced by potential loops .",
    "the dependences on soft energies and momenta of potential and soft fields appear as labels on the fields , while only the lowest - energy ultrasoft fluctuations are associated by an explicit coordinate dependence .",
    "formally this is achieved by a phase redefinition for the potential and soft fields  @xcite @xmath75 where @xmath76 denotes momenta @xmath41 and @xmath77 .",

    "there is still some freedom in the choice of the operator basis for the potential interactions shown in eq.([vnrqcdpotential ] ) , which can affect the matching conditions and the anomalous dimensions . in refs.@xcite",

    "the lagrangian also contains more complicated interactions describing 4-quark potential - like interactions and 4-quark interactions with soft or ultrasoft gluons that contain additional sums over intermediate indices .",
    "their form is partly fixed by the renormalizability of the theory  @xcite , but there is still some freedom in the choice of their form . in this talk",
    "i use the conventions of ref.@xcite were all @xmath84-type potentials are represented by such 4-quark sum operators .",
    "i do not display their expressions here and refer to ref.@xcite where they are collected in an appendix .",
    "one might wonder why the effective theory contains both soft and ultrasoft degrees of freedom at the same time , since , naively , one might argue that for @xmath60 the soft fields fluctuate at a much smaller length scale than the ultrasoft fields .",
    "that both soft and ultrasoft degrees of freedom have to be present at the same time is at the heart of the effective theory construction and is related to the fact that the dispersion relation of the heavy quarks , @xmath39 introduces a correlation between the soft and ultrasoft scales .",
    "the presence of soft and ultrasoft degrees of freedom also allows for the simultaneous summation of logarithms of @xmath92 and @xmath34 , which i mentioned in the introduction , after the theory is renormalized .",
    "i will come back to this point in the next section .",
    "an important point to mention is that the factors of @xmath53 and @xmath52 multiplying the operators in the effective lagrangian are uniquely determined by the mass dimension and the @xmath13 power counting in @xmath93 dimensions  @xcite .",
    "each field in the action is assigned a certain scaling with @xmath13 to keep its kinetic term of order @xmath94 .",
    "this results for example in @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 . then , since @xmath98 , the renormalized combination @xmath99 must be multiplied by @xmath100 for @xmath51 so that this gluon term also scales consistently as @xmath101 . applying the same procedure to all interactions results in the factors of @xmath53 and @xmath52 shown for example in eq.([vnrqcdlagrangian ] ) .",
    "note that this procedure is an integral part of the theory and automatically leads to the correlation of the two renormalization scales , @xmath102 .    to incorporate the effect of the large top quark width we include in the effective lagrangian the operators @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the total on - shell top quark width .",
    "the typical energy of the top quarks at threshold is @xmath105 , and in the standard model one has @xmath106gev@xmath107 .",
    "thus , the propagator for a single top ( or antitop ) with momentum @xmath108 is @xmath109 which gives a consistent nlo treatment of electroweak effects.@xcite the complete nnll order treatment of electroweak effects for the total cross section is currently unknown .",
    "although it is not expected that the unknown electroweak corrections are beyond the few percent level  @xcite , this has to be kept in mind when i discuss the nnll qcd corrections .    besides the interactions contained in the effective lagrangian that describe the dynamics of the @xmath18 pair we also need external currents that describe the production of the top quarks . for @xmath0 annihilation these currents",
    "are induced by the exchange of a virtual photon or a z boson . at nnll order",
    "we need the vector s - wave currents @xmath110 , where @xmath111   \\o{p}{2 } & = & \\frac{1}{m^2}\\ , { \\psip{p}}^\\dagger\\ ,       { \\mathbf p}^2\\bsigma ( i\\sigma_2)\\ , { \\chip{-p}^ * } \\ , , { \\nonumber}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the axial - vector p - wave current @xmath112 , where @xmath113\\,(i\\sigma_2)\\ ,     { \\chip{-p}^ * } \\ , . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the currents have a soft momentum index . the currents @xmath114 and @xmath115 lead to contributions in the total cross section that are @xmath20-suppressed with respect to those of the current @xmath116 .",
    "thus , at nnll order , two - loop matching is needed for @xmath117 and born level matching for @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "note that the two - loop matching result for @xmath120 depends on the choice of the operator basis used in the effective lagrangian .",
    "to sum the logarithmic terms @xmath121 at nnll order , as indicated schematically in eq.([rnnllorders ] ) , one needs to determine the anomalous dimensions of the potentials and currents that contribute to the cross section at the appropriate order .",
    "the computation of the anomalous dimensions in the effective theory works just as for the effective weak hamiltonian .",
    "the coefficient of the @xmath86 ( coulomb ) potential , @xmath85 , needs to be determined at the three - loop level since it contributes already at leading order .",
    "the results are available in ref.@xcite .",

    "it is mandatory to use matrix elements where the external quarks are on - shell because for off - shell quarks one can obtain uv divergences which do not belong to the current .",

    "@xcite    the determination of the nnll order anomalous dimension proceeds along the same lines .",
    "one can distinguish between contributions from two classes .",
    "the first class , called `` mixing contributions '' , arises from the terms in eq.([zc1 ] ) due to the nll order running of the couplings on the rhs of eq.([c1anomdim ] ) .",
    "the second class involves the computation of three - loop vertex diagrams with potential loops and either soft or ultrasoft loops that require new @xmath117 counterterms .",
    "i call this second class `` non - mixing contributions '' .",

    "i have determined the non - mixing contributions recently in ref.@xcite and i will discuss the computation and the results in some detail in the following .    at nnll order",
    "the determination of the uv divergences from on - shell three - loop vertex diagrams is complicated because there are overlapping ir and uv divergences which are difficult to separate from each other .",
    "an efficient way to avoid these complication is to consider 4-loop current correlator graphs rather than the vertex diagrams .",
    "the correlator graphs are obtained from closing the external quark lines of the vertex diagrams with an additional insertion of the current .",
    "0.2 cm    in fig.[figusoftcorrelators ] i have exemplarily displayed the four - loop correlator diagrams with an ultrasoft gluon ( loop ) .",
    "the imaginary part of the correlator graphs is proportional to the squared matrix elements from which all ir - divergent coulomb phases drop out automatically .",

    "i can not give all the details of the computation and the full result here and refer to ref.@xcite .",
    "but i would like to discuss some interesting conceptual aspects of the results .",
    "first , the nnll order @xmath136 coefficient @xmath137 i have obtained by the computations agrees with the nll prediction based on renormalization group invariance mentioned above .",
    "this is a non - trivial check for the consistency of the effective theory under renormalization , since it requires that the interactions between the relevant degrees of freedom are encoded correctly in the structure of the effective lagrangian .",
    "this shows in particular , that the renormalizability of the effective theory requires that soft and ultrasoft degrees of freedom have to be present for all scales below the quark mass @xmath32 .",
    "in addition , the results for the diagrams in fig.[figusoftcorrelators ] , which involve the soft and the ultrasoft renormalization scales , @xmath40 and @xmath42 , show that the correlation @xmath46 i have mentioned previously is required by the renormalizability of the effective theory . as an example , let us consider the contribution to @xmath139 induced by the diagram fig.[figusoftcorrelators]g which , when the correlation between @xmath40 and @xmath42 is neglected , has the form @xmath140 \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the dependence on @xmath141 and @xmath142 in the @xmath129 piece that contributes to the nnll anomalous dimension of @xmath117 vanishes only if the correlation @xmath143 is accounted for .",

    "the new nnll order results are not expected to affect the prospects of a determination with @xmath188  mev since already for the fixed - order nnlo and the earlier nnll order results the conclusions for the top mass determination from simulation studies were quite similar.@xcite",

    "the summations can be obtained within an effective theory where all degrees of freedom that can fluctuate close to their mass - shell are represented as fields and all off - shell fluctuations are integrated out .",
    "all logarithmic terms are associated to uv divergences in the effective theory and the summation of logarithms is achieved by solving the renormalization group equations of the couplings and coefficients of the effective theory . at present all ingredients for a full nnll order prediction of the total threshold cross section are known except for the nnll order result of @xmath117 , the coefficient of the dominant current that produces the top pair in @xmath0 annihilation , which is only fully known at nll order .",

    "the new result does not affect the prospects for a precise determination of the top quark mass from a threshold scan based on earlier work , but it does affect the prospects for the determination of the top yukawa coupling , the strong coupling and the top quark width . however , it is premature to draw definite conclusion as long as the nnll mixing contributions have not yet been determined .",
