    "a large number of large - diameter hi shells ( or supershells )  @xcite have been found in a series of 21  cm line surveys , e.g.  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that these hi supershells could be the result of some kind of explosion events that occurred in stellar associations , and they are commonly interpreted as old supernova remnants ( snrs ) with a typical age of @xmath7  yr  @xcite . as old snrs evolve into the late stage , the radio surface brightness declines and the interior temperature drops that snrs gradually fade away .",
    "the accumulated neutral hydrogen shells will last longer until the velocity of the expansion decreases down to the random velocity of the interstellar medium ( ism).those that exploded at very high galactic latitudes are probably able to avoid the interstellar turbulence and supernova explosions that frequently occur in the near - plane region , and can evolve till old age .",

    "the expected energy conversion efficiency @xmath93 is on the order of 0.2 or less  @xcite , and sometimes can be as low as 0.02  @xcite when severe energetic losses occur .",
    "if we adopt a typical conversion efficiency of 0.2 , the expansion energy of gsh 90 - 28 - 17 requires a star with luminosity log(@xmath94)=5.3 at solar metallicity .",
    "this luminosity implies there is a main - sequence star with mass of 30  m@xmath3 , lifetime of 6.2  myr  @xcite , and spectral type of approximately o7v .",
    "the age of gsh 90 - 28 - 17 estimated from the expansion law is @xmath134.5  myr , similar to the main - sequence lifetime of a 30  m@xmath3 star .",
    "the distance of gsh 90 - 28 - 17 is local .",
    "if the star still exists , it should be detectable .",
    "based on the star evolutionary tracks  @xcite , and using the aforementioned luminosity and effective temperature , the star should now appear as a b1 star . however , there are very few massive stars in the center of the shell . as we searched the simbad database",
    ", there are only 12 b stars , of which the earliest is a b8-type star , which is located near / in the shell walls . the central star is a b8 star , with a distance of @xmath13870  pc , which is too far to be associated with the hi shell . thus the stellar wind ( blown - bubble ) scenario seems to be difficult for explaining the origin of the shell .",
    "the association between non - thermal radio continuum emission at 408 and 1420  mhz with gsh 90 - 28 - 17 , and the pulsar j2307 + 2225 detected within the hi shell indicates that g90 - 28 - 17 is probably an old supernova remnant .",
    "after the cooling - dominated radiactive expansion phase , old snrs will evolve into a late stage , and eventually merge with the interstellar medium and become indistinguishable . adopting a distance of 400  pc ,",
    "we extrapolate the initial explosion energy of gsh 90 - 28 - 17 from the maximum observable radius and the ambient environment following the evolution model for a late stage snr  @xcite , @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the maximum observable radius of the shell in units of pc , @xmath97 is the explosion energy in units of 10@xmath98  ergs , @xmath99 is the mean ambient particle density of 0.9  @xmath81 , and @xmath100 is the metallicity normalized to the solar value . adopting a metallicity @xmath101 ,",
    "the energy required to generate a shell by a single sn explosion is estimated to be about 2.3@xmath102  ergs , which is the typical explosion energy output of a type ii supernova .    the size and age of gsh 90 - 28 - 17 is comparable to supernova remnants that are considered to be very old in the galaxy .",
    "good examples of such type are the monoceros snr ( g205.5 + 0.5 ) and radio loop i ( north polar spur ) .",
    "the age of the monoceros snr is 1.5@xmath16  yr , with a radius of 53  pc and expansion velocity of about 8  @xcite . the radio loop i is considered to be two evolved supernova remnants ( s1 and s2 ) by  @xcite based on the polarization observations at 21  cm .",
    "the modeled radius of these two supernova remnants are about 75  pc ( s2 ) and 81  pc ( s1 ) , with age @xmath103 and @xmath104  yr , respectively .",
    "the expansion velocity of the associated hi shells has two values : 2  from the northern hemisphere ( gs 331 + 14 - 15 ) measured by  @xcite and 19@xmath1425  from the southern hemisphere measured by  @xcite , corresponding to these two supernova remnants that are expanding with different velocities . the properties of the s1 supernova remnant are very similar to those of gsh 90 - 28 - 17 .",
    "this shell is almost dissolved with no observational tracers ( except for the polarization emission loop ) , and could not be found in total intensity surveys .",
    "the snr interpretation of gsh 90 - 28 - 17 makes it among the oldest snrs known .",
    "our case study of this source also demonstrates the capability of high - resolution hi surveys in finding the oldest supernova remnants .",
    "though the radio and x - ray emission in the center of the remnant is rather weak , we are still able to see the well - defined hi shell of gsh 90 - 28 - 17 .",
    "it is generally assumed that the accumulated expanding gas shell will survive 10 times longer until the expansion velocity decreases down to the random velocity of the interstellar medium  @xcite , and then dissolves into the ambient medium .",
    "as the shell remains as a high - density enhancement in a low - density region for a long time , it provides a good environment to allow star formation to progress after a single trigger event .",
    "@xcite have interpreted another hi supershell gsh 138 - 01 - 94 as an old snr with a similar age of 4.3  myr in the far outer galaxy .",
    "it was later suggested by  @xcite to have triggered the star formation in digel s cloud 2 . as a high latitude supershell far from the galactic plane , gsh 90 - 28 - 17 greatly avoids the absorption effect caused by intervening material , and provides a good example to study the last phase of evolution for old snrs in a relatively peaceful environment of the lac ob1 association .",
    "the properties of the hi supershell gsh 90 - 28 - 17 are re - examined using the new arecibo galfa - hi survey data with greatly improved resolution and sensitivity .",
    "we suggest that gsh 90 - 28 - 17 is related to the lac ob1 association , with a distance of 400  pc .",
    "the radius of gsh 90 - 28 - 17 is 66.0@xmath13.5  pc .",
    "the hi mass of the shell is about ( 3.1@xmath2  m@xmath3 .",
    "it has an age of @xmath4  myr and a total kinetic energy of about ( 8.2@xmath5  ergs .",
    "we used the filtering algorithm ( bgf ) following  @xcite to subtract the large - scale diffuse galactic background emission from 408 and 1420  mhz survey maps , and found a radio loop - like ridge associated with the western shell of gsh 90 - 28 - 17 at both frequencies .",
    "the excess brightness of the radio ridge over the background is @xmath105  k at 408  mhz and @xmath106  mk at 1420  mhz .",
    "the tt - plot index of the radio loop - like ridge is @xmath6=-1.35@xmath10.69 , shows a nonthermal origin .",
    "in addition , the pulsar j2307 + 2225 is found inside the shell region at a similar distance .",
    "we discussed the possibility of stellar wind and snr scenarios for the gsh 90 - 28 - 17 .",
    "if it has an origin from stellar wind , the energy source would be a 30  m@xmath3 , o7 star , and should now be observable as a b1 star",
    ". however no star earlier than b8 is found within the shell .",
    "we conclude that gsh 90 - 28 - 17 is probably an old , type ii snr in the galaxy around the solar neighborhood .",
    "the galfa - hi survey was obtained with a 7-beam feed array at the arecibo observatory .",
