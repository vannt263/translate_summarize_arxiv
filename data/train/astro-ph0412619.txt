    "the combined analysis of the type ia supernovae , galaxy clusters measurements and wmap ( wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ) data brings out clearly an evidence of the accelerated expansion of the universe  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the cosmological acceleration strongly indicates that the present day universe is dominated by a smoothly distributed slowly varying cosmic fluid with a negative pressure , the so - called dark energy  @xcite-@xcite ( alternative approaches are presented , for example , in  @xcite ) .    to specify different types of cosmic fluids one",
    "usually uses a phenomenological relation between the pressure density @xmath0 and the energy density @xmath1 , corresponding to each component of fluid @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the equation - of - state parameter or , for short , the state parameter . a component with negative",
    "@xmath3 corresponds to the dark energy .",
    "contemporary experiments , including wmap , give strong support that at present time the dark energy state parameter is close to @xmath4  @xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in particular , it follows from the current observational bounds  @xcite that @xmath3 belongs to the interval : @xmath5 at the @xmath6 confidence level .    from the theoretical point of view",
    "the above - mentioned domain of @xmath3 covers three essentially different cases : @xmath7 and @xmath8 .    * the first case , @xmath9 , is achieved in quintessence models  @xcite-@xcite , which are cosmological models with a scalar field .",
    "such types of models are quite acceptable , but there is a question of an origin of the scalar field . to comply with astronomical experimental data",
    "this scalar field should be extra light and hence it does not belong to the standard model set of fields  @xcite . * the second case , @xmath10 ,",
    "is realized by means of the cosmological constant .",
    "this scenario is admissible from a general point of view except for a problem of an order of the magnitude of the cosmological constant",
    ". it should be @xmath11 times less than the natural theoretical prediction  @xcite . * the third case , @xmath8 ,",
    "is called a `` phantom '' one and can be realized due to a scalar field with a ghost ( phantom ) kinetic term . in this case all natural energy conditions are violated and there are problems of instability at classical and quantum levels  @xcite-@xcite . since experimental data do not contradict with a possibility of @xmath8 and moreover a direct search strategy to test the inequality @xmath8 has been proposed  @xcite , it is interesting to find a noncontradictory model with the condition @xmath8 satisfied is a result of axion consideration . ] .",
    "note the @xmath12-essence models  @xcite can have both @xmath8 and @xmath13 . at the same time",
    "a dynamical transition from the region @xmath13 to the region @xmath8 or vice versa is forbidden under general assumptions  @xcite and is possible only under special conditions  @xcite .",
    "let us recall that in models with a constant state parameter @xmath3 , less than @xmath4 , and the spatially flat friedmann metric the scale factor tends to infinity and therefore the universe breaks down at a finite moment of time .",
    "this problem is known as the `` big rip ''  @xcite , see also @xcite . the simplest way to overcome",
    "this difficulty in models with @xmath8 is to consider a scalar field @xmath14 with a negative time component in the kinetic term  @xcite .",
    "the appearance of a such summand is possible due to quantum effects  @xcite .",
    "however , all proposed models insist of the instability problem .    a possible way to evade the instability problem for models with @xmath8 is to yield a phantom model as an effective one , arising from a more fundamental theory without a negative kinetic term . in particular , if we consider a model with higher derivatives such as @xmath15 , then in the simplest approximation : @xmath16 , such a model gives a kinetic term with a wrong ( ghost ) sign .",
    "it turns out , that such a possibility does appear in the string field theory framework  @xcite . since the concerned model is a string theory approximation , all stability problems related to a model with higher derivatives",
    "are discarded .",
    "our goal in the present paper is to construct an analytic solution in a polynomial model , which is close in some approximation to a model arising in the string theory , namely in the theory of a fermionic nsr string with gso@xmath17 sector .",
    "the scalar field @xmath14 is an open string theory tachyon , which , according to the sen s conjecture  @xcite , describes brane decay , at which a slow transition to the stable vacuum , correlating with states of the closed string , takes place .",
    "other dark energy models , which use the brane - world scenarios , are presented in  @xcite .",
    "the notable feature of the model is a ghost sign of the kinetic term and a special form of the potential : @xmath18    in the first approximation only the first summand in the right hand side of ( [ vphi ] ) can be obtained from the open string field theory in a flat metric  @xcite ( which corresponds to @xmath19 ) .",
    "the second summand allows us to save the form of the interpolating solution obtained in the flat metric for the case of the friedmann universe , i.e. at an arbitrary @xmath20 .",
    "note , that the appearance of higher powers of @xmath14 is possible if we take into account the heavier perturbations of the string  @xcite , but we can not expect to obtain the explicit values of the coefficients of the potential ( [ vphi ] ) from the string theory . the performed in this paper stability analysis of solutions points out that the constructed solution is an attractive one and there are no essential changes in the behavior of the solutions for some variations of the potential parameters .",
    "this gives reasons to assume , that the qualitative behavior of the physical parameters @xmath21 in the model with the potential ( [ vphi ] ) under certain conditions becomes close to the behavior of the corresponding ones in the model with a string theory potential .",
    "the constructed solution has no singular points and becomes the de - sitter solution at large time .",
    "it does not contradict to the general theorems of the relativity theory because the energy conditions are violated in the considered model ( this question is discussed in  @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the cosmological model , which is an approximation for the string inspired model , and write down the solutions to the friedmann equations with the special polynomial potential . in section 3",
    "we consider the phantom dynamics in detail and find out that our solution describes an accelerating universe . in section 4 we study the stability of the solution with respect to variations of initial data and peculiar variations of a form of the potential . in section 5 we do sum up the obtained results and point out the ways for generalization of the considered model .",
    "let us consider the gravitational model with a phantom scalar field and the spatially flat friedmann metric .",
    "since the origin of the phantom field , considering in this paper , is connected with the string field theory we include the typical string mass @xmath22 and a dimensionless open string coupling constant @xmath23 in the action .",
    "the action is : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the planck mass , @xmath26 is a spatially flat friedmann metric : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the scale factor .",
    "the coordinates @xmath29 and the field @xmath14 are dimensionless .",
    "hereafter we use the dimensionless parameter @xmath30 .",
    "independent equations of motion are as follows @xmath31 here @xmath32 is the hubble parameter : @xmath33 and the dot denotes the time derivative .",
    "if the scalar field depends only on time , i.e. @xmath34 , then @xmath35 we recast system ( [ eomprho ] ) to the following form @xmath36 besides of equations ( [ eom12 ] ) one can obtain from the action ( [ action ] ) an equation of motion for the field @xmath14 @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "this equation is in fact a consequence of system ( [ eomprho ] ) . expressing @xmath32 through @xmath14 and @xmath39",
    ", we obtain @xmath40 here @xmath41 factor selects the proper branch of the square root .",
    "the expanding universe corresponds to @xmath42 .      at present time one of the possible scenarios of the universe evolution",
    "considers the universe to be a d3-brane ( 3 spatial and one time variable ) embedded in higher - dimensional space - time .",
    "d - branes do naturally emerge in the open string theory ( in our case we consider fermionic open strings containing both gso@xmath43 and gso@xmath17 sectors ) .",
    "the d - brane in question is unstable and does evolve to the stable state .",
    "this process is described by the open string dynamics , which ends are attached to the brane ( see reviews @xcite and references therein ) . if only the lowest excitation  the tachyon  is taken into account then the d - brane dynamics are described by an action of the open string tachyon .",
    "there are two common ways to describe the tachyon behavior : dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) approximation and the level truncation scheme in the covariant string field theory @xcite .",
    "the level truncation method advocated itself checking the sen s conjecture and , therefore , it is natural to use it to analyze the dynamics of the d - brane , see @xcite .",
    "the action for the tachyon resulting from the fermionic string field theory in the approximation of the slow - varying auxiliary field  @xcite has the form @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the dimensionless tachyon field and the coordinates and the constant @xmath23 are also dimensionless .",
    "the tilde means an action of the non - local operator @xmath46 on the field @xmath45 .",
    "the subscript `` flat '' hereafter indicates the flat background metric is used .",
    "note that in the bosonic string case the interaction is cubic . for the space homogenous configurations",
    "only the dependence on time @xmath47 is left and the action takes the form @xmath48 introducing the notation @xmath49 and @xmath50 , we rewrite the equations of motion obtained from the last action in the following form @xmath51 where @xmath52 . in fact",
    "this equation is integral one since the exponent containing an infinite number of derivatives can be replaced with an integral operator @xcite in some class of fields as follows @xmath53 note , that equation ( [ flattinteom ] ) without the first summand is an equation for the @xmath0-adic string ( in our case @xmath54 )  @xcite . in the latter case the existence of a solution interpolating between vacua has been proved @xcite .",
    "previously this solution has been numerically constructed in  @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ flattinteom ] ) was investigated in @xcite and an existence of a rolling solution , i.e. a solution interpolating between the two vacua of the potential @xmath55 was shown numerically .",
    "it is remarkable that the late time behavior of the rolling solution can be effectively described by a lagrangian with a ghost sign of the kinetic term and the same potential .",
    "the corresponding action has the form @xmath56 as known , the equation of motion derived from the action ( [ flatteffact ] ) : @xmath57 has an interpolating solution  a kink @xmath58      system of equations ( [ eom12 ] ) with some polynomial potential @xmath59 is not integrable .",
    "the numeric analysis of the friedmann equations with the potential ( [ flatv ] ) has been performed in the paper  @xcite .",
    "it is known ( see , for example  @xcite ) that it is always possible to find the potential @xmath59 , if either @xmath60 or @xmath61 are given explicitly .",
    "it is worth to note that our model has common features with models considered in brane - world scenarios ( see appendix ) .",
    "following  @xcite , we assume , that @xmath61 is a function of @xmath60 , called superpotential , that is @xmath62 . using equality @xmath63",
    ", we obtain from system ( [ eom12 ] ) : @xmath64    let us find a potential , which corresponds to the field @xmath14 of type ( [ kinkphi ] ) .",
    "this function satisfies the following equation @xmath65 hence , from ( [ eom1w ] ) it follows @xmath66 where @xmath67 is an integration constant .",
    "once @xmath68 is known we obtain the potential @xmath59 from ( [ eom2w ] ) .",
    "different values of @xmath67 correspond to different @xmath59 .",
    "the requirement that @xmath59 is an even function is equivalent to the condition @xmath69 . in this case @xmath70    it can be straightforwardly verified that if @xmath60 is a solution to ( [ eom1w ] ) , ( [ eom2w ] ) with some potential @xmath59 , then @xmath71 is a solution as well .",
    "for example , @xmath72 also is a solution to ( [ eom1w ] ) , ( [ eom2w ] ) with the potential ( [ ourv ] ) .",
    "indeed these two solutions correspond to the one and the same function @xmath61 , but to the two different functions @xmath68 .",
    "we have constructed the potential @xmath73 , using an explicit form of a solution .",
    "now we consider more general problem and look for solutions , starting with the the following two requirements : @xmath60 is a smooth function with nonzero asymptotics @xmath74 and the superpotential @xmath68 is a polynomial in @xmath14 not more than the third degree . in the first condition we can put @xmath75 without loss of generality .",
    "the second condition guarantees that the potential @xmath59 will be a polynomial in @xmath14 and its degree is not more than six .",
    "the above conditions allow us to rewrite equation ( [ eom1w ] ) in the following form : @xmath76 from the asymptotic conditions it follows @xmath77 taking into account ( [ conditions ] ) we solve equation ( [ subs ] ) and obtain @xmath78 we do not consider another solution : @xmath79 , because it is not a smooth function .",
    "thus , up to a scaling and a time shift we obtain a solution , which coincides with the solution in the flat metric .",
    "it is evident that the potential obtained from ( [ eom2w ] ) coincides with ( [ ourv ] ) up to an overall factor .",
    "it is interesting that under above - mentioned conditions on a solution and a superpotential , the sixth degree potential is a minimal possibility for existence of an interpolating solution .",
    "one can also see , that any solution to the equations of motion in flat space with the fourth degree potential is a solution to the friedmann equations either with the sixth degree polynomial potential or with a nonpolynomial potential  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that we have built an exact solution without any approximation .",
    "one of the standard approaches to the analysis of cosmological solutions in the presence of a scalar field is the so called slow - roll approximation which technically means a neglecting of the terms @xmath80 in equation ( [ eomphi2order ] ) and @xmath81 in the expression for the energy ( [ prho ] ) .",
    "however , from ( [ dotphi ] ) it follows that for our solution the following relations take place : @xmath82    it is evident that the slow - roll approximation in this case is valid only when @xmath14 is close to  @xmath83 .",
    "the above - mentioned approximation describes our solution at very large times and can not be used for its description in the beginning ( close to zero ) moments of time .",
    "the hubble parameter for the constructed solution is given by @xmath84 this parameter goes asymptotically to @xmath85 when @xmath86 , or equivalently @xmath87 .",
    "once @xmath61 is known one readily obtains the scale factor @xmath88 where @xmath89 is an arbitrary constant .",
