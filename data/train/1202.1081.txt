    "the _ simplex conjecture ( sc ) _",
    ", one of the oldest and most famous problems of information theory @xcite , can be formulated as follows .",
    "prove that the regular simplex signal set @xmath0 , whose signal vectors are the @xmath1 vertices of a regular @xmath2-dimensional simplex ( @xmath3 ) centered at the origin , is optimal ( over all signal sets with @xmath1 signal vectors ) for the time - discrete _ additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) _ channel , if equiprobable signal vectors are used and if the sum over all signal vector energies is constant .",
    "an optimal signal set maximizes the average probability of correct signal vector decoding assuming that an optimal decoder is used .",
    "the corresponding optimization constraint is expressed by a constant signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "this ratio is a function of the signal and noise parameters ; it should be defined such that equal transmission conditions for all signal sets under comparison are guaranteed .",
    "the interest into the sc with its turbulent history culminated after the seminal shannon lecture `` towards a proof of the simplex conjecture ? '' by massey @xcite , presented at the 1988 ieee international symposium on information theory in kobe , japan . at this occasion , massey separated the sc into two variants with different signal energy constraints : the classical _ weak simplex conjecture ( wsc ) _ , where the energies of all signal vectors are equal ( equal - energy - constraint ) , and the _ strong simplex conjecture ( ssc ) _ , where they are constrained only by an average energy limitation . before this , predominantly the wsc was considered in literature .",
    "massey s spark of interest in the ssc increased the latitude to attack this hard problem .",
    "indeed , five years after massey s shannon lecture , steiner proved that `` the strong simplex conjecture is false '' @xcite . for his disproof",
    ", he found a one - dimensional counterexample signal set that outperforms the @xmath0 signal set for small values of the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the validity of the ssc implies the validity of the wsc .",
    "however , the invalidity of the ssc does not make any statement about the validity or invalidity of the wsc . despite this fact , the interest of the information theory community into the classical  still unsolved  wsc diminished after steiner s result .    at the 2nd asian - european workshop on information theory in 2002 , where tribute was paid to massey ,",
    "the first author of the present paper reported about the progress in solving the wsc and ssc during the period after massey s shannon lecture @xcite . at this occasion ,",
    "a potential inconsistency of the optimization constraint was revealed . in order to bring clarity into this possible inconsistency",
    ", we recently rechecked and discussed steiner s results from @xcite .",
    "although all his proofs are mathematically correct , we concluded that slightly modifying the optimization constraint of the ssc ( i.e. ,  the interpretation of the signal - to - noise ratio ) can cause ambiguity in the interpretation of steiner s results .",
    "our conclusion was that he considered his counterexample signal set under an inadequate optimization constraint expressed by an interpretation of the signal - to - noise ratio that penalizes the @xmath0 signal set .",
    "thus , his interpretation does not provide equal transmission conditions for all signal sets under comparison .    in the following section ,",
    "the main steps of steiner s disproof are presented and confirmed by numerical results . in section  [ sec",
    ": classical ] , we show that the disproof is not valid any more if the classical definition of the signal - to - noise ratio is applied .",
    "this classical definition was used by shannon for the asymptotic comparison of optimal codes in the time - discrete awgn channel @xcite . in section  [ sec :",
    "comparison ] , we explain why this fundamental interpretation of the signal - to - noise ratio is appropriate for a correct examination of the ssc while the interpretation from @xcite is not . in section  [ sec : actual ] , we introduce a new counterexample signal set that is a modification of steiner s and that actually outperforms the @xmath0 signal set for small values of the the signal - to - noise ratio expressed by shannon s fundamental interpretation .",
    "in @xcite , steiner introduced the unusual signal set shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : l1 ] and denoted it as @xmath4 .",
    "he showed that it can outperform the regular simplex signal set @xmath0 under a particular optimization constraint as discussed in the following .",
    "@xmath4 is one - dimensional signal set consisting of two antipodal signal vectors @xmath5 and @xmath6 having equal energy @xmath7 and @xmath8 additional signal vectors @xmath9 placed at the originsome critics of steiner s disproof claim that the @xmath8 overlapping signal vectors must be regarded as a single signal vector with higher a - priori probability equal to @xmath10 .",
    "using this point of view , it is easy to show that @xmath4 never performs better than the @xmath0 signal set under steiner s optimization constraint .",
    "however , this result does not invalidate steiner s disproof because a minor variation of the @xmath4 signal set , where the signal vectors @xmath9 are displaced from the origin by an arbitrarily small @xmath11 , renders them again equiprobable and mutually distinct . ] , such that @xmath12 .",
