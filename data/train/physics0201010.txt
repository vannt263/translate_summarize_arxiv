    "the nuclear weak charge @xmath6 of an atom is a parameter of the atomic pnc arising from the nucleon - electron vector axial vector interaction .",
    "it is possible to extract @xmath6 by measuring the pnc induced electric dipole transition amplitude @xmath7 and combining it with atomic theory calculations .",
    "the @xmath7 of the @xmath5 @xmath8 transition has been measured to very high accuracy@xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 of @xmath5 obtained from the experimental data after combining with the atomic theory calculations@xcite was further refined to @xmath9 after the measurement of the @xmath8 transition polarizability@xcite .",
    "this has a @xmath10 deviation from the predictions of the standard model @xmath11@xcite .",
    "the uncertainty of the experiment results and atomic theory calculations are estimated at .35% and 1% respectively .",
    "this indicate the possibility of improving the results further by reducing the atomic theory uncertainty .",
    "the recent atomic theory calculations which treat the breit interaction more rigorously have introduced corrections of .9%@xcite , .6%@xcite and .4%@xcite to @xmath6 of @xmath5 .",
    "the variation of the results is due to the difference of the calculation methods and many - body effects included .",
    "the uncertainties of these calculations are estimated at 1% .",
    "considering the unique implications of the parameters obtained from the atomic pnc phenomena to the physics beyond the standard model , it is desirable to reduce the atomic theory uncertainties and also confirm the @xmath5 results using other atoms .",
    "an important criteria of choosing a candidate atom is the @xmath12 scaling of the pnc interaction , which indicates the advatage of choosing high @xmath13 atom .",
    "the @xmath14 transition of atomic yb@xmath15 , which has been studied theoretically@xcite and experimentally@xcite in detail is a promising candidate of the ongoing and future atomic pnc experiments .",
    "this transition is a suitable choice due to the nearly degenerate @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which can enhance the pnc mixing .",
    "the pnc mixing enhancement between this pair of levels can also be exploited in the @xmath18 transition .",
    "the @xmath18 transition was proposed for atomic pnc experiment in a recent work@xcite and estimates @xmath19 which is almost one order of magnitude larger than that of @xmath5 @xmath20 . the use of the metastable state @xmath21 as the initial state offers the possibility of separating only the atomic density dependent plane of polarization rotation angle from the wave - length dependent systematic errors .",
    "this is expected to better the results obtained from the stark - interference experiments , where the use of the high intensity laser fields limits the statistical precision due to the light shift .    in this paper",
    "we have investigated the @xmath7 of the @xmath22 transition using multi - configuration dirac - fock method .",
    "the atomic theory calculations are necessary to extract the nuclear weak charge @xmath6 from the experimental value of @xmath7 . to check the accuracy of the atomic calculations we also study the transition properties and hyper fine structure constants .",
    "all the calculations are in atomic units ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the nuclear spin - independent atomic pnc arises from the axial - vector vector electron - nucleon interaction component of the neutral weak current interaction between the electrons and nucleons of an atom .",
    "the interaction is mediated by @xmath24 bosons , which is a prediction of the electron - weak unification .",
    "the effective form of the interaction hamiltonian can be obtained by treating the nuclear part non - relativistically @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the fermi coupling constant , @xmath27 is the dirac matrix and @xmath28 is the nuclear density .",
    "the pnc induced @xmath1 transition amplitude between the initial and final states @xmath29 and @xmath30 is @xmath31 ,     \\label{e1pnc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 are the intermediate states which are opposite in parity to @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the energies of the states .",
    "the numerator of ( [ e1pnc ] ) has @xmath36 , effective only within the nuclear region due to the nuclear density @xmath37 and the dipole @xmath38 in length gauge , which has significant contribution from the large radial range .",
    "and the energies in the denominator has large contribution from the mid radial range where the electron density is high .",
    "the calculation of the @xmath39 require atomic state functions which are accurate over all radial ranges .",
    "@xmath7 can be calculated once the atomic wave - functions are known .",
    "a method suitable for rare earth atoms which has large configuration mixing is the multi - configuration dirac - fock ( mcdf ) , which is the relativistic adaptation of the multi - configuration hartree - fock .",
    "the mcdf approximates an atomic state function @xmath40 as a linear combination of configuration state functions ( csf ) @xmath41 , which are again a linear combination of slater determinants . where @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the parity , total angular momentum and magnetic quantum numbers respectively , and @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the additional quantum numbers required to defined the asf and csfs uniquely .",
    "then @xmath47 where @xmath48 are the coefficients of the csfs .",
    "the energy functional is defined using a set of asfs which mix strongly and the dirac - coulomb hamiltonian @xmath49 +                  \\sum_{i < j}^{n , n}\\frac{1}{r_{ij } } ,     \\label{dcham}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the dirac matrices , @xmath52 is the momentum and @xmath53 is the number of electrons .",
    "the orbitals are then generated variationally .",
    "the orbitals from the negative continuum are also the solutions of such a method , however only the bound states can be chosen by imposing the boundary condition that the orbitals @xmath54 as @xmath55 .",
    "choosing the asfs contributing to the valence - valence correlation effects , the orbitals captures important correlation effects .",
    "though mcdf method can represent the valence - valence correlation , it is not a suitable method to calculate core - valence and core - core correlation effects .",
    "a large number of csfs is required to represent these correlation effects , which is computationally difficult as self consistent field method like mcdf is not suitable for a calculation involving large csf spaces .",
    "however , these correlation effects can be calculated using configuration interaction(ci ) using a set of virtual orbitals generated from the mcdf potential .",
    "a large set of csfs is required in the ci calculation to represent all classes of correlation effects .",
    "a more efficient method is to model it using the most important csfs and modifying the form of the electron - electron coulomb interaction potential as @xmath56 where @xmath57 are the constants that modifies the @xmath58 multipole of the inter electron coulomb interaction potential .",
    "the suitable values of these constants can be obtained by matching properties like excitation energies calculated using this potential with the experimental data .",
    "the earlier calculations have shown that , this approach can reproduce the experimental data to very good agreement@xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath59 are chosen such that @xmath60 and for consistency the screening parameters are used in the mcdf calculations to generate the orbitals .      the most important transition properties like oscillator strength , life time , polarizability , etc arise from the electric dipole transition . and",
    "all of these depend on the reduce matrix elements of the electric dipole operator .",
    "consider the initial and final states of the atom @xmath29 and @xmath30 , then from wigner - eckert theorem @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the total angular momenta of the final and initial states , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the magnetic quantum number of the final and initial states , and @xmath66 is the component of the dipole operator .",
    "@xmath67 is the reduced matrix element and it is independent of geometry .",
    "the reduced matrix elements can be expressed in terms of the asfs as @xmath68 the oscillator strength of the transition @xmath69 is @xmath70 where @xmath71 .",
    "the independent particle approximation of the inter - electron electromagnetic interaction implies that it is not gauge invariant .",
    "however , the gauge invariance is restored if the inter - electron electromagnetic interaction is represented completely by including the correlation effects correctly .",
    "the agreement of the dipole matrix elements or transition properties calculated in different gauges indicate the completeness of the correlation effects included , which can also be interpreted as the accuracy of the wave - functions .",
    "the hyperfine constants are the measure of the strength of the electron - nucleus parity allowed electromagnetic multipole interactions .",
    "the general form of the interaction hamiltonian is @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are spherical tensor operators of rank @xmath75 in the electron and nuclear space respectively .",
    "these represent the electromagnetic multipoles .",
    "the @xmath76 corresponding to the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole respectively are the most important .",
    "the atomic states are then the eigenstates of the total angular momentum @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the nuclear spin .",
    "the shift in energy due to the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole hyperfine interactions of the atomic state @xmath79 are @xmath80 where @xmath81 , and @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole hyperfine constants respectively .",
    "these are defined as @xmath84^{\\frac{1}{2 } } }             \\langle\\gamma_jj||\\bm{t}^{(1)}||\\gamma_jj\\rangle     \\nonumber \\\\",
    "b_j & = & 2q\\left [ \\frac{2j(2j-1)}{(2j+1)(2j+2)(2j+3)}\\right ] ^{\\frac{1}{2 } }             \\langle\\gamma_jj||\\bm{t}^{(2)}||\\gamma_jj\\rangle     \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the nuclear magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments .",
    "the low - lying levels of the yb are given in the fig [ figure1 ] .",
    "the @xmath87 mixing between the @xmath88 and @xmath89 reduces to mixing between @xmath90 and @xmath91 at the single particle level , which is negligible as @xmath90 is almost zero in the nuclear region .",
    "however , @xmath92 and @xmath91 mixing can occur through the mixing @xmath93 , which arises due to the strong configuration mixing between @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "so the most important contribution to the @xmath96 transition amplitude is @xmath97 this indicates that the choice of @xmath98 as initial state offers the possibility of non - zero contribution from the leading configurations to the normal and conjugate terms . whereas the largest contribution to the @xmath99 is @xmath100 the conjugate term does not contribute as @xmath95 is double excitation with respect to @xmath101 .",
    "all the calculations are done using grasp2@xcite package .",
    "the choice of the screening parameters @xmath59s and the dependence of the excitation energies on these parameters are discussed in an earlier work@xcite .",
    "the values of the @xmath57s which can give excitation energies very close to the experimental data are @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 and rest are set to unity .",
    "the even and odd parity csf space consist of the following non - relativistic configurations : + even parity @xmath105 odd parity @xmath106 the configuration space is chosen to represent the important valence - valence and core - valence correlation effects . the excitation energies calculated using these choices of @xmath57s and configurations are given in table[table1 ] .",
    ".[table1 ] the excitation energies of the low - lying levels in @xmath107 [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the @xmath7 calculated using the theoretical results is @xmath108 .",
    "the important contributions are from the intermediate states @xmath109 and @xmath110 , each of these yield @xmath111 and @xmath112 respectively . the cancellation due to",
    "the @xmath110 is large but is nearly compensated by the contributions from the intermediate states @xmath113 and @xmath114 , which totals to @xmath115 .",
    "however , as mentioned earlier , the energy spacing of the important levels are not correct .",
    "in addition @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 also show variations from the experimental data and previous theoretical calculation@xcite . using the experimental excitation energies , the average of the experimental data of @xmath118 , and the other @xmath119s calculated by porsev  et  al@xcite gives @xmath120 .",
    "the contribution from the intermediate state @xmath109 is @xmath121 which is calculated using the reduced matrix element of @xmath122 from the present work , the @xmath123 from porsev  et  al@xcite and the enrgy denominator from the experimental data .",
    "the estimate of the @xmath122 using the wave functions we have calculated is expected to be better as the magnetic dipole hyperfine structure constant of @xmath124 is in better agreement with the experimental data .",
    "our mcdf calculations shows that the @xmath125 pnc transition amplitude of @xmath3 is more than two order of magnitude larger than that of the @xmath126 .",
    "our calculation indicates the experimental proposal of kimball@xcite shows that @xmath127 is indeed a promising candidate for the @xmath7 measurements .",
    "these calculations were done using the enterprise450 at the indian institute of astrophysics , bangalore and the ibm workstations at the physical research laboratory , ahmedabad .",
