    "in contrast to continuous dynamical systems , there is not yet a systematic theory and only limited effective methods available in the study of dynamical systems with discontinuities , but symbolic dynamics may be a useful tool in this study .",
    "for example , in @xcite a symbolic dynamics approach for the study of fractal pattern in second - order non - linear digital filters is presented ; in @xcite symbolic dynamics for some invertible 2-dimensional discontinuous hyperbolic maps is discussed ; in @xcite symbolic dynamics analysis for generalized piecewise isometries is given , and some interesting examples and open questions are presented ; in @xcite symbolic analysis for piecewise continuous and piecewise monotone transformations on the interval @xmath0 $ ] is discussed , and by giving necessary and sufficient condition for an arbitrary symbol sequence to be an @xmath1-address , an algorithm to calculate the topological entropy is given .",
    "most recently , in @xcite some orbits of a class of non - ergodic piecewise affine maps of the 2-torus are described in terms of a symbol shift obtained from the `` triadic odometer '' substitution rule .    in this paper",
    "we show that symbolic dynamics method is helpful when considering a class of piecewise linear maps on the 2-torus , i.e. , the maps @xmath2 on @xmath3 with the form below : @xmath4 where @xmath5 , and this map can be thought of as a map @xmath6 where @xmath7 ( we also write @xmath8 for convenience ) and @xmath9 is a map that takes modulo @xmath10 in each component , and we assume the determinant @xmath11 . as pointed out by adler in @xcite , the symbolic dynamics even for hyperbolic automorphisms of the 2-torus",
    "( i.e. , all coefficients in ( [ eq_torusmap ] ) are integers , and the map is hyperbolic type ) remains a fertile area for research , while there are some results in higher dimensions .",
    "in general there are still few general methods for the class of maps ( [ eq_torusmap ] ) , the symbolic analysis in this paper represent some technical steps towards this .",
    "we focus on the symbolic dynamics for this class of maps , and we present some necessary and sufficient conditions for admissibility of sequences . we also give some results concerning the measure of the maximal invariant set of certain non - invertible maps of this type generalizing a result of @xcite .    in @xcite for planar piecewise isometries we have introduced symbolic codings underlying map operations .",
    "it has been shown that this kind of codings is helpful for revealing the dynamical properties of the maps . in this paper",
    "we use this idea to symbolically analyze the maps of the form ( [ eq_torusmap ] ) .",
    "in @xcite it is shown that for the parabolic map of the form ( [ eq_torusmap ] ) ( i.e. , @xmath12 , and the trace @xmath13 ) the 2-dimensional systems have 1-dimensional dynamical characteristics , that is , the system possesses invariant straight line segments along the eigen - direction . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that the tl map , a piecewise linear hyperbolic map defined on the whole plane , can be decomposed , along stable and unstable manifolds , into two coupled one - dimensional maps .",
    "based on these ideas we perform a dimension reduction in certain cases of the general 2-torus maps ( [ eq_torusmap ] ) .    in @xcite for the tl map",
    ", the orbit of a given point is encoded according to the sign of @xmath14 in the @xmath1-th image and the sign of @xmath15 in the @xmath16-th pre - image , and the symbolic sequences define an ordering of the contracting and expanding foliations of the phase plane",
    ". then admissibility conditions for symbolic sequences can be given by ordering rules of the foliations .",
    "in this paper we generalize these ideas by introducing codings underlying the map operations , we give symbolic descriptions of the dynamics and admissibility conditions for itineraries , and present explicit expressions in terms of the codings for periodic points .",
    "the maps ( [ eq_torusmap ] ) can be classified into three types , depending on the eigenvalues @xmath18 of @xmath19 we refer to the map as type i ( @xmath20 ) , type ii ( @xmath21 ) or type iii ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "when @xmath23 , i.e. , the map is area - preserving , then we can refer to a type i , ii or iii map as being hyperbolic , parabolic or elliptic , respectively , as we discussed in @xcite .",
    "we code the orbits of the torus map ( [ eq_torusmap ] ) by 2-d vector @xmath24 based on the following partition of the phase space ( see figure  [ fig_parti ] ) @xmath25 where @xmath26    this coding underlies the map operations , as the system ( [ eq_torusmap ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath27    for all @xmath28 we can define a unique itinerary , this is a map @xmath29 with @xmath30 the set of infinite words with @xmath31 letters , i.e. , the @xmath31 pairs @xmath24 , where @xmath32 , @xmath33 recall that a symbolic sequence @xmath34 is admissible if there exists a point @xmath35 such that @xmath36 . let @xmath37 be the subset of all admissible sequences , then the following diagram commutes : @xmath38 so characterizing the structure of @xmath39 would be helpful to the understanding of the dynamics of @xmath40 on @xmath41 .",
    "we discuss in this section the type i and ii cases of ( [ eq_torusmap ] ) , namely , the cases where the eigenvalues are real .",
    "suppose the @xmath1-th iteration @xmath42 of the map with coding @xmath43 is located on the straight line @xmath44 : @xmath45 where @xmath46 , and @xmath47 is an eigenvector for @xmath8 .",
    "then we have :    [ prop1-d ] a type i or type ii map ( [ eq_torusmap ] ) sends points on line @xmath44 to points on line @xmath48 , where @xmath49 . in this sense , the @xmath17-dimensional system ( [ eq_torusmap ] ) possesses @xmath10-dimensional dynamics .",
    "we have @xmath50 substituting ( [ eqa ] ) and ( [ eqb ] ) into ( [ eqd ] ) , we have : @xmath51 and substituting ( [ eqc ] ) into ( [ eqe ] ) , we get : @xmath52 that is , a type i or type ii map ( [ eq_torusmap ] ) sends points on line @xmath44 to points on line @xmath48 , and line @xmath48 can be determined through ( [ eq_gamma ] ) by @xmath44 and coding @xmath53 . if we identify all points on line @xmath54 to be a single point , @xmath55 , then there is a factor system that is @xmath10-dimensional .",
    "rewrite ( [ eq_gamma ] ) as @xmath56 so we get the relation among @xmath57 and the codings @xmath58 for @xmath59 : @xmath60 under the condition that @xmath61 , the last term in ( [ eq_gamma2 ] ) vanishes as @xmath62 goes to infinity , and we have : @xmath63    whenever @xmath64 is a periodic sequence , that is , @xmath65 where @xmath66 denotes the periodic concatenation of its argument , and if this is admissible then there will be some points @xmath67 with @xmath36 and @xmath68 calculated by ( [ eqf ] ) is also a periodic sequence , and @xmath69 therefore , if the itinerary of @xmath70 is periodic , its orbit @xmath71 will jump periodically among @xmath1 straight line segments @xmath72 with the same slope .",
    "this is similar to quasi - periodic motion in elliptic systems in which quasi - periodic points jump periodically among finite number of circles with the same radius . for system ( [ eq_torusmap ] ) in type i and type ii cases we call an orbit starting from @xmath70 periodically coded if @xmath73 is a periodic sequence .",
    "numerical results show that for some parameters , asymptotically , @xmath74 takes values within a quite narrow range , that means under the dynamics the whole phase space can be shrunk into a very small subset .",
    "( see figure  [ fig_finite_lines ] ) .    in some cases",
    ", @xmath74 may only take a finite number of values for each orbit .",
    "for example , we have    when @xmath75 is any real number , then @xmath74 takes at most two values for each orbit .",
    "this can be shown as follows .",
    "now @xmath40 is an area preserving parabolic map with eigenvalue @xmath76 .",
    "so @xmath77 and therefore @xmath78 .",
    "according to ( [ eq_gamma ] ) , @xmath79 so @xmath80 are all integers .",
    "but for @xmath81 , therefore @xmath74 takes at most two values : @xmath82 when @xmath83 , then @xmath84 for all @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , all points on the line @xmath85 are fixed points of @xmath40 . for @xmath86 , the motion of the orbit from the initial point @xmath87 will just restrict on two lines @xmath88 and @xmath89 , where @xmath90 .    for a general area preserving torus map @xmath40 discussed in @xcite , we have @xmath91 .",
    "then @xmath92 as the eigenvalue @xmath76 , and therefore @xmath93 according to ( [ eq_gamma ] ) , @xmath94 so we have @xmath95    [ propgamma ] when @xmath96 , and @xmath97 is rational , then @xmath74 takes a finite number of values for each orbit .",
    "now @xmath40 is an area - preserving semi - rational parabolic map . since @xmath97 is rational , from ( [ eqgamma ] )",
    "there is a integer @xmath31 such that @xmath98 are all integers .",
    "note that @xmath99 are bounded , so @xmath74 can only take a finite number of values for each orbit .",
    "in @xcite it is shown that for a rational parabolic torus map ( @xmath100 are both rational ) the maximal invariant set @xmath101 has positive lebesgue measure . here",
    "we further have    for a semi - rational parabolic torus map ( @xmath97 is rational ) the maximal invariant set @xmath101 has positive lebesgue measure .    from proposition  [ propgamma ]",
    "an orbit of @xmath40 is contained in finite number of straight lines @xmath102 note that @xmath40 is piecewise continuous and preserves lebesgue measure locally .",
    "so the intersection of the maximal invariant set @xmath101 with these lines contains at least one line segment @xmath103 with positive length ( in fact , the intersection usually contains countable line segments possessing positive length ) . by similar argument used in this paper",
    ", the location of @xmath103 can be determined _ linearly _ by the codings of the orbit , @xmath74 and @xmath97 .",
    "let @xmath104 vary continuously in a certain small range such that the codings keep unchanged and ( [ eqgamma ] ) keep valid , then the location of @xmath103 and its length changes continuously .",
    "in this way we get a small 2-dimensional piece with positive lebesgue measure .",
    "because this piece is contained in @xmath101 , @xmath101 therefore has positive lebesgue measure .",
    "the above proposition partially solved an open problem in @xcite .",
    "it still remains unknown whether @xmath101 has positive measure for irrational parabolic torus maps .",
    "we can check that we can take @xmath106 where @xmath107 is an eigenvalue of @xmath19 .",
    "when @xmath105 , then @xmath108 , and the system ( [ eq_torusmap ] ) becomes @xmath109    we suppose @xmath110 .",
    "when @xmath111 , the map ( [ eq_torusmap2 ] ) is continuous , so we further suppose @xmath112 .",
    "therefore system ( [ eq_torusmap2 ] ) is type i with two eigenvalues @xmath113 , and @xmath114 .",
    "we can code the orbits of the torus map ( [ eq_torusmap2 ] ) by just a number @xmath115 , rather than by a @xmath17-d vector @xmath24 , based on the following partition of the phase space @xmath116\\}\\\\ p_s & = & \\{(x , y)\\in[0,1)^2 , s\\le ax+by < s+1\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    suppose an orbit from @xmath117 with the symbolic sequence @xmath118 as its itinerary , and suppose the @xmath1-th iteration @xmath119 is on the straight line @xmath44 @xmath120 which relates to the stable manifold direction @xmath121 , then from ( [ eqf ] ) we have @xmath122 here the infinite series does converge as @xmath123 .",
    "[ propadmiss ] the admissibility condition for symbolic sequences @xmath124 is @xmath125 and the condition for a symbolic sequence @xmath126 to be the itinerary of a given point @xmath87 is @xmath127    for an admissible symbolic sequence @xmath126 , a point @xmath119 with coding @xmath128 on the straight line segment @xmath129 is mapped to a point @xmath130 with coding @xmath131 on the straight line segment @xmath132 so whenever an initial point @xmath87 is on the straight line segment @xmath133 , then @xmath119 would be on the straight line segment @xmath44 .",

    "that is , let @xmath31 be the matrix such that @xmath208 where @xmath209 is the determinant , and @xmath210 are two eigenvalues , then let @xmath211 the linear system on the 2-torus becomes the complex system : @xmath212 where @xmath213 are parallelogram partition elements obtained by shearing the original partition elements @xmath214 ( see figure  [ fig_parti ] ) , and @xmath215 are translation terms induced by the transformation .    for the type of system ( [ eq_complex ] )",
    ", we can introduce a coding underlying map operations , which generalizes the one introduced for the overflow oscillation system in @xcite , and give a symbolic description about the periodic points .",
    "we will present some details in the next section for planar piecewise isometries .      from ( [ eq_complex ] ) a type iii torus map with unit determinant ( @xmath12 )",
    "can be represented in jordan normal form as a anti - clockwise rotation by @xmath216 followed by a translation , that is , the map is equivalent to a planar piecewise isometry after a linear shearing .    in general",

    "to see what are the situations we may face , here as an example we remark briefly on the piecewise isometry of the torus obtained from the overflow oscillation problem ( see @xcite for details ) .",
