    "there have been many researches to evaluate densities and quantiles of symmetric or general stable distributions .",
    "mcculloch ( 1998 ) considered efficient algorithms for approximating symmetric stable densities @xmath0 for the range @xmath1 , where parameter @xmath2 denotes the characteristic exponent .",
    "nolan ( 1997 ) gave accurate algorithms for general stable densities based on integral representations of the densities which were derived by zolotarev ( 1986 ) .",
    "nolan provides a very useful program package `` stable '' on his web page .",
    "however his program exhibits some unreliable behavior around the boundary as stated in the users guide of stable",
    ". therefore even in the case of symmetric stable distributions , reliable computations of density functions including all the boundary cases is still needed .",
    "furthermore for maximum likelihood estimation , it is desirable to directly compute the derivatives of the density function . in this paper",
    "we present reliable computations of symmetric stable density functions and their partial derivatives .",
    "our computation of densities is accurate for all values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 . concerning the partial derivatives it is accurate in a somewhat smaller range of values .    regarding maximum likelihood estimation for the range @xmath5 , nolan ( 2001 ) used interpolated stable densities and maximized the likelihood by approximate gradient search ( constrained quasi - newton method ) because of its efficiency . but",
    "near the boundary of the parameter space interpolation may be inaccurate and the direct integral representation is used .",
    "note that the direct integral representation is also not very reliable and slow near the boundary . in the symmetric case ,",
    "brorsen and yang ( 1990 ) discussed maximum likelihood estimation using an integral representation of the densities given by zolotarev ( 1986 ) .",
    "but they have only considered the range @xmath6 to avoid the discontinuity and nondifferentiability at @xmath7 .",
    "furthermore they did not check the sample covariances of their maximum likelihood computation with the fisher information matrix .",
    "these previous researches on maximum likelihood estimation have not used direct evaluation of the derivatives of the log likelihood function with respect to the parameters . for reliable evaluation of the maximum likelihood estimator and its standard error , direct and reliable evaluation of",
    "the first and the second derivatives of the log likelihood function is desirable .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section [",
    "sed : preliminaris ] we summarize notations and preliminary results on symmetric stable density . in section [ sec :",
    "density ] we provide an accurate algorithm for calculations of symmetric stable distributions which modifies nolan ( 1997 ) for @xmath3 near @xmath8 or @xmath9 and for @xmath7 or @xmath10 using various expansions .",
    "accurate algorithms for the partial derivatives of symmetric stable distributions with respect to the parameters are given in section [ sec : derivative - location - scale ] and section [ sec : derivative - alpha ] .",
    "fisher information matrices are calculated in section [ sec : fisher - information ] , together with some simulation studies on the variance of the maximum likelihood estimator and the observed fisher information .",
    "we also discuss behavior of fisher information as @xmath11 .",
    "some discussions are given in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "in this section we prepare notations and summarize preliminary results .",
    "there are many parameterizations for stable distributions and much confusion has been caused .",
    "our parameterizations follow the useful parameterizations for statistical inference which were given in nolan ( 1998 ) .",
    "let @xmath12 denote the characteristic function of symmetric stable distribution with parameters @xmath13 where @xmath2 is the characteristic exponent , @xmath14 is a location parameter and @xmath15 is a scale parameter . for the standard case @xmath16 we simply write the characteristic function as @xmath17    the corresponding density",
    "is written as @xmath18 and @xmath0 in the standard case : @xmath19 at @xmath7 @xmath20 is the cauchy density and at @xmath10 @xmath21 is the normal density @xmath22 .",
    "accordingly the density can be defined to constitute a location - scale family . in the following ,",
    "the first derivative of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath3 is denoted by @xmath23 and the second derivative is denoted by @xmath24 . then @xmath25 the partial derivatives with respect to @xmath15 and @xmath2 are written by subscripts , e.g. , @xmath26 as above , when these derivatives are evaluated at the standard case @xmath16 we write @xmath27 , @xmath28 , etc .",
    "note that @xmath29 furthermore we write @xmath30    the reason we consider up to the second order derivatives of the density function is that in assessing the standard error of the maximum likelihood estimator @xmath31 , the observed fisher information @xmath32 is usually preferred to the value of the fisher information matrix at @xmath33 ( e.g. efron and hinkley ( 1978 ) ) .",
    "note that there are other parameterizations of symmetric stable distributions than ( [ eq : characteristic - function ] ) .",
    "however different parameterizations in the literature are smooth functions of each other including the boundary @xmath10 and differentiations in terms of other parameterizations can be obtained from the results of this paper by the chain rule of differentiation .      from equation ( 2.2.18 ) of zolotarev ( 1986 ) or theorem 1 of nolan ( 1997 )",
    ", the density @xmath0 for the case @xmath34 and @xmath35 is written as @xmath36 where @xmath37 note that at @xmath38 @xmath39 for all @xmath40 .",
    "for the case @xmath41 and @xmath42 , @xmath43 , the following expansion can be used .",
    "@xmath44 for @xmath45 , this series is not convergent but can be justified as an asymptotic expansion as @xmath46 . for @xmath47 , it is convergent for every @xmath3 .",
    "similarly for the case @xmath48 and @xmath40 , @xmath43 , we have @xmath49 for @xmath45 this series converges for every @xmath50 and for @xmath6 this series can be justified as an asymptotic expansion as @xmath51 . for @xmath10",
    "this asymptotic expansion is zero , which corresponds to the fact that the tail of normal distribution is exponentially small .",
    "these ( asymptotic ) expansions are stated in bergstrm ( 1953 ) , section xvii.6 of feller ( 1971 ) , section 2.4 and section 2.5 of zolotarev ( 1986 ) .",
    "as in nolan ( 1997 ) we numerically evaluate the density function using ( [ dense ] ) . in ( [ dense ] ) the function @xmath52 \\to [ 0,\\infty]$ ] plays an important role , because properties of this function make the numerical integration quite efficient .",
    "note that @xmath53 is continuous and positive , strictly increases from @xmath8 to @xmath9 for @xmath54 and strictly decreases from @xmath9 to @xmath8 for @xmath6 .",
    "therefore the integrand @xmath55 is unimodal and its maximum value @xmath56 is uniquely attained at @xmath57 satisfying @xmath58 .",
    "when the value of density is small , the integrand concentrates around its mode very narrowly .",
    "then quadrature algorithms may miss the integrand .",
    "therefore we solve @xmath59 for @xmath57 and the integral is divided into two intervals around this mode ( see nolan ( 1997 ) ) . for numerical calculations of ( [ dense ] ) we use adaptive integration with singularity ( qags ) in gnu scientific library ( 2003 ) . for most values of @xmath3 and @xmath2",
    "this integration works well .",
    "however , when @xmath2 is close to @xmath60 this algorithm has some difficulty .",
    "note that for @xmath10 @xmath61 and @xmath62 . therefore @xmath57 exceed @xmath63 when @xmath64 .",
    "there are some other numerical difficulties in ( [ dense ] ) .",
    "we list these difficulties and propose alternative practical methods for evaluating the density .    1 .",
    "@xmath2 is small and @xmath65 : + if @xmath2 is small , the density is very much concentrated at @xmath38 .",
    "for example nolan ( 1997 ) states @xmath66 whereas @xmath67 . in our calculations when @xmath2 is small and @xmath3 near @xmath8 the values of ( [ dense ] ) sometimes become larger than @xmath68 , contradicting the unimodality of the stable density . for this case we can use the asymptotic expansion ( [ eq : xto0 ] ) .",
    "@xmath69 : + we can not guarantee the accuracy of ( [ dense ] ) in the case of @xmath69 . since stable distributions have heavy tails , reliable calculation of their densities is needed for large @xmath3 . in our calculations",
    "when @xmath6 and @xmath3 is large the values of ( [ dense ] ) sometimes become much smaller than the asymptotic expansion ( [ eq : xtoinf ] ) . for this case we can use the asymptotic expansion ( [ eq : xtoinf ] ) .",
    "@xmath2 is near 1 : + the representation ( [ dense ] ) can not be applied at @xmath7 theoretically .",
    "the numerical quadrature of ( [ dense ] ) becomes unreliable because of roundoff errors , when @xmath2 is close to @xmath70 .",
    "@xmath2 is near 2 : + though the representation ( [ dense ] ) can be applied near @xmath10 theoretically , it seems to be too close to the normal distribution in the tail of the distribution .",
    "actually the values of the density in the tail obtained by the integral representation ( [ dense ] ) is much smaller than the asymptotic expansion ( [ eq : xtoinf ] ) .    for the rest of this section",
    ", we discuss the cases 3 and 4 above .    for @xmath71 , we consider taylor expansion of the density around @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath72 denote the euler s constant throughout the rest of this paper .",
    "the taylor expansion of @xmath0 around @xmath7 is given as follows .",
    "@xmath73 where @xmath74 for convenience the explicit form of @xmath75 is given in appendix [ sec : alpha-3 ] .",
    "( [ eq : alpha-1 - 1 ] ) and ( [ eq : alpha-1 - 2 ] ) are proved as follows . from the equation 4.40 on page 18 of oberhettinger ( 1990 ) @xmath76,\\ ] ] where @xmath77 differentiating ( [ eq : oberhettinger ] ) several times with respect to @xmath78 , setting @xmath79 , and combining the results in the inversion formula we obtain ( [ eq : alpha-1 - 1 ] ) and ( [ eq : alpha-1 - 2 ] )",
    ". the conditions for change of integral and differentiation are satisfied in these cases .",
    "although higher order derivatives of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath2 can be evaluated along the same line , we found that the three term expansion ( [ eq : alpha-1 ] ) is sufficiently accurate .",
    "now we consider the case @xmath80 and @xmath69 .",
    "it seems natural to use asymptotic expansion ( [ eq : xtoinf ] ) .",
    "however the normal density has an exponentially small tail and this expansion is meaningless for @xmath10 .",
    "however in view of smoothness at @xmath10 , an approximation around the normal density is desirable .",
    "this case is somewhat subtle , but we found that the following procedure works well numerically . note that from ( [ eq : xto0 ] ) , for each fixed @xmath3 , @xmath0 is differentiable with respect to @xmath2 @xmath81 even at @xmath10 , i.e. , for each fixed @xmath3 we have @xmath82 differentiating ( [ eq : xtoinf ] ) with respect to @xmath2 , for large @xmath3 , heuristically we have @xmath83 and @xmath84    we summarize our treatments of various boundary cases in table [ tdense ] .",
    "the range of @xmath3 and @xmath2 and the number of terms @xmath85 in the expansions ( [ eq : xto0 ] ) and ( [ eq : xtoinf ] ) are shown .",
    "for @xmath86 we use formula ( [ eq : alpha-1 ] ) and for @xmath87 and for @xmath3 large we use the maximum of ( [ dense ] ) and ( [ eq : alpha-2 ] ) . note that for most cases a small number of terms in the expansions ( [ eq : xto0 ] ) or ( [ eq : xtoinf ] ) is sufficient .",
    "the approximations are very effective since the expansions and the integral ( [ dense ] ) give virtually the same results for most values of @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    ".approximations to stable density at boundary cases [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tbl : information - alpha - sigma ]",
    "in this paper we proposed reliable numerical calculations of the symmetric stable densities and their partial derivatives including various boundary cases .",
    "we found that except for very small values of @xmath2 ( @xmath88 ) our method works very well .",
    "this enables us to reliably compute the maximum likelihood estimator of the symmetric stable distributions and its standard error .    for the family of stable distributions ,",
    "the use of the observed fisher information in ( [ eq : observed - fi ] ) for assessing the standard deviation of the maximum likelihood estimator needs further investigation .",
    "our simulation suggests that there may be some merit in using only the first term on the right hand side of ( [ eq : observed - fi ] ) .",
    "further study is needed to theoretically establish the limiting behavior of the fisher information matrix as @xmath89 .",
    "finally it is of interest to extend the methods of the present paper to the general asymmetric stable densities and to the multivariate symmetric stable densities .",
    "these extensions will be studied in our subsequent works .",
