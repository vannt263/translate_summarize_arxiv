    "a flexible polymer chain in a dilute solution is influenced by both hydrophobic interactions between the monomers and the excluded volume effect .",
    "the attractive interactions are neglected at high temperatures or in a good solvent , but become significant as the temperature @xmath1 is lowered .",
    "as @xmath1 reaches a special temperature @xmath0 , the linear polymer undergoes an abrupt change from an expanded conformation for @xmath2 to a fully compact conformation for @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "long polymer in a good solvent is a critical system , and the collapse transition at @xmath4 has been identified as a tricritical transition  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 point behavior is well - described by self - avoiding walks with attractive interaction energy assigned for each pair of nonbonded nearest - neighbor monomers .",
    "the tricritical exponents take the mean - field values for @xmath5 , and there are logarithmic corrections at @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "a great deal of studies have been performed to understand the nature of the collapse transition in two dimensions  @xcite , which is expected to exhibit much more non - trivial behavior than its higher dimensional counterparts .    in this work ,",
    "we study the collapse transition of a polymer on a square lattice , with both nearest - neighbor ( nn ) and next nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) interactions present , by calculating the exact partition functions up to chain length @xmath7 .",
    "we estimate the crossover exponent and the transition temperature from the zeros of the partition function , and also from the specific heat . although the method of partition function zeros became one of the most popular tools for studying the critical phenomena with the advancement of computational power  @xcite , there are few works where partition function zeros of lattice polymers were calculated . for examples ,",
    "exact partition function zeros were computed for the simple - cubic lattice up to chain length 13  @xcite , for the face - centered lattice up to chain length 9  @xcite , and for the square lattice up to chain length 36  @xcite .",
    "only nn interactions were present in these works .",
    "in fact , the current work is the first instance where a _ square_-lattice polymer with nnn interactions is ever studied .",
    "it was only on a hexagonal lattice that models with nnn interactions were studied previously  @xcite .    by introducing nnn interactions ,",
    "the transition behavior is much more pronounced than that of the model only with nn interactions  @xcite .",
    "the results suggest that the model belongs to the same universality class as the one described by the model with only nn interactions .",
    "conformations of a polymer chain with @xmath8 monomers are modeled as a two - dimensional self - avoiding chain of length @xmath8 on a square lattice .",
    "the position of the monomer @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 , where integers @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the cartesian coordinates relative to an arbitrary origin .",
    "chain connectivity requires @xmath13 , i.e. , bond length is unity . due to the excluded volume , there can be no more than one monomer on each lattice site , @xmath14 for @xmath15 .",
    "the attractive hydrophobic interaction is incorporated by assigning the energies @xmath16 and @xmath17 for each non - bonded nn and nnn contact between monomers .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian is @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 the result when only nn interactions are present , corresponding to the @xmath0 point  @xcite , can be reproduced by putting @xmath21 .",
    "we consider the case with @xmath22 .",
    "the energy of the system is then @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the number of contacts between nn and nnn monomers , respectively .",
    "here we define the reduced number of conformations @xmath26 , where conformations related by rigid rotations , reflections , and translations are regarded as equivalent , and counted only once . on the other hand , due to an assumption that the polymer chain has an intrinsic direction , the conformations with reverse labels @xmath27 for all @xmath28",
    "are considered distinct .",
    "it is easy to see that the total number of conformations generated by rotations and reflections from a given conformation is eight , except for the straight chain where the total number of conformations generated by rotations and reflections is four due to invariance with respect to reflection perpendicular to the chain .",
    "the total number of conformations @xmath29 is obtained from @xmath26 as follows : @xmath30 thus , one can achieve about eight - fold reduction in the computing time by enumerating the reduced number of conformations @xmath26 instead of @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "we obtained @xmath31 up to @xmath7 by the help of a parallel algorithm classifying conformations by sizes of rectangles they span  @xcite .",
    "yang and lee  @xcite first introduced the concept of the partition function zeros in the complex fugacity plane , and found a mechanism for the occurrence of phase transitions in thermodynamic limit .",
    "later , fisher  @xcite showed that the partition function zeros in the complex temperature plane are very important in understanding phase transitions . for system exhibiting the temperature - driven phase transition",
    ", the locus of fisher zeros forms a line and crosses the positive real axis in thermodynamic limit .",
    "the intersection point of the locus with the positive real axis corresponds to the critical temperature .",
    "the zeros closest to the positive real axis are called the _ first",
    "_ zeros , which approach the positive real axis as the system size increases .",
    "the partition function of our model is @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "we see that since @xmath35 is bounded , the partition function ( [ pf ] ) is a @xmath36-th order polynomial of @xmath37 where @xmath36 is the maximum value of @xmath35 .",
    "the partition function zeros @xmath38 are then obtained by solving the polynomial equation @xmath39 .",
    "the solution was found with mathematica . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ first_zeros ] , the first zeros approach the positive real axis in the complex temperature plane as polymer length increases .",
    "near the critical temperature @xmath40 , the radius of gyration ( or the end - to - end distance ) @xmath41 of a polymer chain with @xmath8 monomers is generally expressed by the scaling theory  @xcite , @xmath42 where the reduced temperature is defined as @xmath43 and the scaling function @xmath44 behaves as follows : @xmath45 the exponent @xmath46 represents the geometrical properties of a polymer , and the crossover exponent @xmath47 describes how rapidly the system undergoes the transition as @xmath1 approaches @xmath40 .",

    "we obtain 0.4422(14 ) for the crossover exponent as shown in fig .",
    "[ nphi ] , where the estimated error could be further reduced by removing unreliable data obtained from @xmath52 .",
    "the error is estimated by examining the robustness of the extrapolated value with respect to perturbations of the data points , but it is not a statistically rigorous confidence level  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we estimated the error  by slightly changing the ratio of nnn and nn interactions , @xmath53 , which we set to 1 in the current work",
    ". we change @xmath54 by 0.5 , and get @xmath55 for both @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "if we assume that @xmath54 is irrelevant and combine the results for @xmath56 , @xmath58 , and @xmath57 , the resulting range of the crossover exponent is @xmath59 .",
    "the result is consistent with the conjectured exact value of @xmath60 obtained from hexagonal lattice with random annealed forbidden faces@xcite , as well as our previous estimate from the model with @xmath61 interactions only , @xmath62 , suggesting that they belong to the same universality class .",
    "more extensive analysis for various values of @xmath54 is postponed for a future study .    without additional information",
    ", we assumed the leading finite size correction to @xmath47 is of order @xmath63 when performing the bst procedure .",

    "@xmath64 fixed , we performed bst extrapolation with the leading finite size correction of order @xmath65 with @xmath66 and @xmath57 .",
    "we get @xmath67 and @xmath68 for @xmath66 and @xmath57 respectively , and combining these results with that for @xmath69 , we get @xmath70 , again consistent with both the conjectured exact value and the estimate from the model with @xmath61 interactions only . again , there is no evidence that our model belongs to a universality class different from that of the model with nn interactions only .",

    "[ first_zeros ] , the transition behavior is much more visible when we introduce nnn interactions .",
