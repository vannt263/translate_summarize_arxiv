    "the problems discussed in this paper are inspired by isogeometric analysis ( iga ) , which was developed in @xcite .",
    "the core idea of isogeometric analysis is to use the spline based representation of cad models directly for the numerical analysis of partial differential equations ( pde ) . for a more detailed description of the isogeometric framework",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "one of the advantages of iga is the possibility to have discretization spaces of high order smoothness .",
    "these spaces can then be used to directly solve high order pde problems . there exist several fourth ( and higher ) order problems of practical relevance . for their application in iga",
    "see @xcite , as well as @xcite for kirchhoff - love shells , @xcite for the cahn - hilliard equation and @xcite for the navier - stokes - korteweg equation .",
    "the spline based representation of the physical domains allows for high order smoothness within one b - spline patch .",
    "however , most geometries of practical relevance can not be represented directly with one patch but have to be parametrized using a multi - patch approach .",
    "it is not trivial to construct smooth function spaces over multi - patch domains .",
    "many results for multi - patch domains can be derived from considerations on a single interface , hence in the following we will restrict ourselves to two - patch domains .",
    "we are interested in @xmath0 isogeometric function spaces over two - patch domains .",
    "more precisely , we compute the dimension and construct a stable basis for a special class of , so called , analysis - suitable @xmath3 parameterizations .",
    "this class of geometries was first introduced in @xcite , where it was also shown that exactly the geometries of this class allow under certain assumptions @xmath4 isogeometric spaces with optimal approximation properties ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . note that an isogeometric function is @xmath0 if its graph surface is @xmath3 .",
    "hence , the analysis - suitability condition is a restriction of the more general geometric continuity condition .",
    "we refer to @xcite for the definition of geometric continuity .    the existing literature about the construction of @xmath4-smooth isogeometric functions on two - patch ( and multi - patch ) domains can be roughly classified into two possible approaches .",
    "the first one employs @xmath5-surface constructions around extraordinary vertices to obtain a set of @xmath4-smooth functions , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the second approach studies the entire space of @xmath4-smooth isogeometric functions on any given two - patch ( or multi - patch ) parameterization and generate a basis of the corresponding @xmath4 isogeometric space . examples",
    "are @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we follow the second approach , especially explored in @xcite .",
    "we extend these results in two main directions .",
    "first , these existing constructions and investigations are limited to piecewise bilinear domains .",
    "our approach encloses the much wider class of analysis - suitable @xmath5 parameterizations , which contains the class of piecewise bilinear domains .",
    "second , our construction works for non - uniform splines of arbitrary bidegree @xmath1 with @xmath2 and of arbitrary regularity @xmath6 with @xmath7 within the two single patches .",
    "in contrast , the constructions @xcite are restricted to biquartic ( for special cases ) and to biquintic bzier elements and the constructions @xcite are restricted to bicubic and biquartic uniform splines of regularity @xmath8 .",
    "further differences to @xcite are that our approach allows the construction of nested @xmath4 isogeometric spaces and that our basis functions are explicitly given , whereas the basis functions in @xcite are implicitly defined by means of minimal determining sets for the bzier coefficients .",
    "similar to @xcite , the explicitly given basis functions possess a very small local support and are well conditioned .",
    "moreover , the spline coefficients of our basis functions can be simply obtained by means of blossoming or fitting .",
    "this could provide a simple implementation in existing iga libraries .",
    "in addition , we present the study of the dimension of the resulting @xmath4 isogeometric spaces for all possible configurations of analysis - suitable @xmath5 two - patch parameterizations .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : prel ] we describe some basic definitions and notations which are used throughout the paper",
    ". section  [ sec : c1-smooth ] recalls the concept of @xmath4-smooth isogeometric spaces over analysis - suitable @xmath5 two - patch parameterizations .",
    "the dimension of these spaces , which depends on the considered two - patch parameterization , is analyzed in section  [ sec : dimension ] .",
    "then we present in section  [ sec : basis ] an explicit construction of basis functions , and describe in section  [ sec : matrices ] their resulting spline coefficients by means of blossoming ( and fitting ) .",
    "finally , we conclude the paper in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",

    "we denote by @xmath11 the ( tensor - product ) spline space of degree  @xmath12 ( in each direction ) , which is defined on @xmath9 by choosing the open knot vector @xmath13 ( in each direction ) given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 for all @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the number of different inner knots ( in each direction ) .",
