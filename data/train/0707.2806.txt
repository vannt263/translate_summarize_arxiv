    "the interplay between supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) and star formation is now recognized as a critical ingredient in galaxy evolution , as demonstrated by the correlations between the blackhole masses and the bulge properties of their host galaxies ( @xmath2-@xmath3 relation ) @xcite . however , because the star formation rate ( sfr ) is difficult to measure around active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , we are unable to answer basic questions about the interrelations between the two processes : in what star - forming environments does agn activity tend to be triggered ?",

    "insights into the far - ir emission mechanism can also constrain the structure of the circumnuclear material and its evolution with redshift ( see * ? ? ?",

    "progress on these topics requires the ability to identify the contribution of star formation to the ir emission .",
    "although the commonly used star - formation tracers ( the total uv , h@xmath4 and ir emission ) may be contaminated severely by the nuclear emission , there are several alternatives to estimate the sfr in agn , such as the extended uv emission , extended mid - ir emission , and narrow metal emission lines .",
    "the extended uv emission can be observed with high - resolution telescopes such as _ hst_. however , due to the large brightness contrast between type 1 agn and the host galaxy in the uv , this method is limited to type 2 agn , and even for them the scattered nuclear uv emission may be significant @xcite .",

    "in addition , this method suffers from other problems , for example , the [ oii]@xmath73727 flux of pg quasars indicates a very low sfr @xcite , which is inconsistent with the abundant molecular gas in these objects and possibly a result of under - estimating the amount of extinction of the emission line @xcite .    in this study",

    "the continua underlying the 7.7 @xmath0 m aromatic features and silicate features are defined as power laws over three spectral windows , 5.2 - 5.5 @xmath0 m , 5.5 - 5.8 @xmath0 m and 6.7 - 7.0 @xmath0 m .",
    "these spectral regions are selected to avoid the possible ice feature at 6.0 @xmath0 m and aromatic features at 6.2 @xmath0 m .",
    "we then fit the continua - subtracted spectra simultaneously with two aromatic features at 7.7 and 8.6 @xmath0 m and the silicate feature .",
    "the shapes of the aromatic features are assumed to be drude profiles . due to the low ew of aromatic features in agns ,",

    "the height of the 8.6 @xmath0 m feature is also fixed to be one - third of that of the 7.7 @xmath0 m feature .",
    "this relative height is similar to those of two average spectra of hii - like nearby galaxies obtained by @xcite . for the silicate feature ,",
    "we fit only the blue wing with a doppler profile .",

    "the measured aromatic flux depends little on the selected red end wavelength .",
    "the feature is considered detected if the height of the 7.7 @xmath0 m feature is five times greater than the mean noise in the continuum .",
    "for the 11.3 @xmath0 m feature , the silicate feature behaves like a continuum and the slope of the underlying silicate profile varies smoothly across the aromatic feature . therefore , we are able to determine the silicate profile simply with a quadratic interpolation . the 11.3 @xmath0 m feature is fitted with two drude profiles centered at 11.23 and 11.33 @xmath0 m with fixed fwhms of 0.135 and 0.363 @xmath0 m , respectively .",
    "the combination of these two drude profiles fits well the 11.3 @xmath0 m features of nearby galaxies , as demonstrated with high s / n irs spectra by @xcite .",
    "after the spectrum is rebinned to a resolution of 0.1 @xmath0 m , the continuum ( plus silicate feature ) shape is defined by using a quadratic interpolation over the four continuum spectral regions , 9.7 - 10.0 , 10.0 - 10.3 @xmath0 m , 10.7 - 11.0 @xmath0 m and 11.7 - 12.1 @xmath0 m .",
    "we then fix the continuum shape , the fwhm and the center wavelength of the two drude profiles , but adjust the normalization of the continuum and the strength of drude profiles to fit the spectra in the range including the continuum and the feature ( 9.7 - 10.3 @xmath0 m and 10.7 - 12.1 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "the feature is considered detected if the height of the combination of the two drude profiles is five times greater than the mean noise in the continuum .",
    "if the feature is not detected , the upper limit is calculated by assuming the same relative strength of the two drude profiles as given by the fit and taking five times the mean noise for the total height of the two profiles .",
    "we visually inspected each detected feature and found that the 11.3 @xmath0 m features of eleven objects may not be real due to larger noise around the feature relative to the mean noise in the continuum . for fifteen objects ,",
    "the continuum was also fitted with an alternative quadratic interpolation , due to a large change in the slope of the silicate profile around the 11.3 @xmath0 m feature .",
    "however , the difference in the feature strength is smaller than a factor of 1.5 , showing that the continuum fitting procedure does not affect our results strongly .    to test the robustness of our procedures against strong continua",
    ", power - law continua with different strengths are added to the star - forming templates from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the 7.7 and 11.3 @xmath0 m aromatic features are extracted using the above procedures and the flux variations are smaller than 1% for the ew range from the original value ( @xmath211@xmath0 m ) to 0.01 @xmath0 m .",

    ", we find that the differences are always below 10% .",
    "to estimate the uncertainty caused by the photon noise and the fit of the continuum and silicate feature , we produce a noiseless spectrum for each detected aromatic feature .",
    "the simulated noiseless spectrum for the 7.7 @xmath0 m feature is the measured power - law continuum plus the measured dopper profile of the silicate feature plus two drude profiles of the measured 7.7 and 8.6 @xmath0 m features . the spectrum for 11.3 @xmath0 m is the quadratically interpolated continuum and silicate profile plus two measured drude profiles .",
    "we then perturb this noiseless spectrum 100 times to produce noisy spectra with mean s / n equal to the observed s / n .",
    "the aromatic features are then extracted from these simulated spectra in the same way and the 1-@xmath3 uncertainty is obtained as the difference between the original flux and those from the simulated spectra .",
