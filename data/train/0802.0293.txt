    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics has been proven to be successful in the energy scale of the present colliders .",
    "experimental results obtained from recent experiments at cern lep and fermilab tevatron confirm the @xmath5 gauge structure of sm .",
    "however , the higgs boson which is crucial for electroweak symmetry breaking and mass generation has not been observed , and one of the main goals of future experiments is to pursue its trace . although the exact value of the higgs mass is unknown there are experimental bounds for it .",
    "direct searches from aleph , delphi , l3 , and opal collaborations at cern lep provide a lower bound on the higgs mass of @xmath6 gev @xcite .",
    "indirect experimental bounds for the higgs mass are obtained from fits to precision measurements of electroweak observables .",
    "the current best fit value sets an upper bound of @xmath7 gev @xcite .",
    "if a higgs boson is detected at future tev scale colliders , it will be crucial to test its couplings to the sm particles .",
    "precision measurements of higgs couplings may give us some hints for new physics beyond the sm .",
    "it is argued that cern lhc has a potential to search for the higgs boson in the entire mass range allowed . in case",
    "it is found at cern lhc , precision measurements of its couplings to the sm particles can be obtained at future linear @xmath8 colliders . after linear",
    "@xmath8 colliders are constructed its operating modes of @xmath9 and @xmath10 are expected to be designed @xcite .",
    "a real gamma beam is obtained through compton backscattering of laser light off the linear electron beam where most of the photons are produced at the high energy region .",
    "the luminosities for @xmath9 and @xmath10 collisions turn out to be of the same order as the one for @xmath8 @xcite , so the cross sections for photoproduction processes with real photons are considerably larger than the virtual photon case .",
    "polarizability of the real gamma beam is an additional advantage for polarized beam experiments .",
    "therefore @xmath9 and @xmath10 collisions should be discussed as complementary to @xmath8 collisions .    in this work we analyzed the anomalous _",
    "wwh _ vertex in the @xmath9 collision .",
    "we consider the process @xmath11 .",
    "this process isolates the _ wwh _ vertex and gives us the opportunity to study the _ wwh _ vertex independent from _",
    "zzh_. on the other hand in @xmath8 collisions , observables depending on _ wwh _ also receive contributions from the _ zzh _ and it is very difficult to dissociate _ wwh _ from _ zzh _ @xcite .",
    "anomalous _ wwh _ couplings can be investigated in a model independent way by means of the effective lagrangian approach @xcite . in writing effective operators we employ the formalism of @xcite .",
    "imposing lorentz invariance and gauge invariance and retaining up to dimension six operators in the effective lagrangian , the most general coupling structure is expressed as ,    @xmath12\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 represent the momentum of two w or z boson ( v = w , z ) . for a convention",
    "we assume that all the momenta are outgoing from the vertex . within the standard model at tree level ,",
    "the couplings are given by @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "in the literature there have been several studies for anomalous _ wwh _ couplings .",
    "the lhc will start operating soon .",
    "anomalous gauge couplings of the higgs boson have been studied at the lhc via the weak - boson scattering @xcite and vector boson fusion @xcite processes .",
    "there has been a great amount of work on anomalous _ wwh _ couplings which focus on the future linear @xmath8 collider and its @xmath9 and @xmath10 modes . anomalous _ wwh _",
    "couplings have been analyzed through the processes @xmath19 @xcite , @xmath20 @xcite , @xmath11 @xcite , and @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the anomalous cross sections are quadratic functions of the anomalous parameters @xmath22 i.e. ,    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the sm cross section , @xmath25 is the interference term between the sm and the anomalous contribution , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the pure anomalous contributions . in ref .",
    "@xcite authors ignore quadratic anomalous coupling terms in the cross section calculations ; they retain contributions only up to the lowest nontrivial order , i.e. @xmath28 .",
    "this is reasonable due to the higher dimensional nature of their origin . on the other hand",
    ", these quadratic terms generally have a higher momentum dependence than linear terms and may have a significant contribution at high energies .",
    "for example , in the anomalous _ wwh _ vertex ( 1 ) coefficients of @xmath29 and @xmath30 have a momentum dependence of dimension 2 .",
    "therefore in the anomalous cross section for the process @xmath0 , the contributions @xmath26 contain two additional momentum dependence when we compare with @xmath25 . of course the terms @xmath26",
    "are suppressed by the inverse powers of new physics energy scale ( nps ) but their contribution grows faster than the contribution of @xmath25 as the energy increases and approaches nps .",
    "therefore these quadratic anomalous contributions should be considered at high energy processes .",
    "we will consider all anomalous terms in our tree - level cross section calculations .",
    "as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we take into account initial electron and photon polarizations before compton backscattering .",
    "furthermore we take into account initial electron beam polarization which takes part in the subprocess and also the final state polarizations of _ w _ boson .",
    "we will show that these polarization configurations which have not been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite lead to a significant amount of improvement in the sensitivity limits .",
    "the process @xmath0 takes part as a subprocess in the @xmath8 collision . a real gamma beam which enters the subprocess",
    "is obtained through compton backscattering of laser light off linear electron or positron beam .",

    "the maximum value of @xmath39 reaches 0.83 when @xmath40 in which the backscattered photon energy is maximized without spoiling the luminosity .",
    "backscattered photons are not in fixed helicity states .",
    "their helicities are described by a distribution :    @xmath41 } \\over{1-y+1/(1-y)-4r(1-r)-\\lambda_{e}\\lambda_{0}r\\zeta ( 2r-1)(2-y)}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the helicity dependent differential cross section for the subprocess can be connected to initial laser photon helicity @xmath36 and initial electron beam polarization @xmath42 through the formula    @xmath43\\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{4}(1+p_{e})\\left[(1+\\xi(e_{\\gamma},\\lambda_{0 } ) ) d\\hat{\\sigma}(+,r;\\lambda_{w})+(1-\\xi(e_{\\gamma},\\lambda_{0 } ) ) d\\hat{\\sigma}(-,r;\\lambda_{w})\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath44 is the helicity dependent differential cross section in the helicity eigenstates ; @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath42 and @xmath38 refer to different beams .",
    "@xmath42 is the electron beam polarization which enters the subprocess but @xmath38 is the polarization of initial electron beam before compton backscattering .",
    "the integrated cross section over the backscattered photon spectrum is    @xmath48    where @xmath49 .",
    "the process @xmath0 is described by three tree - level diagrams ( fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "each of the diagrams contains an anomalous _ wwh _ vertex .",
    "the helicity amplitudes have been calculated using vertex amplitude techniques derived in ref . @xcite and",
    "the phase space integrations have been performed by grace @xcite which uses a monte carlo routine .    in our calculations",
    "we choose to work with a higgs boson of mass 120 gev which is compatible with current mass bounds .",
    "we accept that initial electron beam polarizability is @xmath50 is plotted for @xmath51=0 , -0.8 , and + 0.8 in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "we see from the figure that backscattered photon distribution is very low at high energies in @xmath51=+0.8",
    ". therefore we will only consider the case @xmath52 in the cross section calculations .",
    "one can see from figs.[fig3]-[fig5 ] the influence of the initial state polarizations on the deviations of the total cross sections from their sm value . in fig.[fig3 ] initial polarization configurations @xmath53 are omitted since they coincide with @xmath54 .",
    "we see from figs .",
    "[ fig3]-[fig5 ] that cross section is very sensitive to @xmath42 .",
    "this is reasonable due to @xmath55 structure of the @xmath56 vertex in the feynman diagrams .",
    "deviation of the cross section from its sm value reaches its maximum at the @xmath57 polarization configuration . in figs.[fig6]-[fig8 ] we plot the total cross section as a function of anomalous parameters for various final state polarizations . in these figures",
    "tr and lo stand for `` transverse '' and `` longitudinal , '' respectively .",
    "we see from these figures that cross section is very small in the longitudinal polarization configuration . on the other hand , longitudinal polarization remarkably improves the deviations from the sm at the positive values of the parameter @xmath3 .",
    "for instance , in fig.[fig7 ] longitudinal cross section increases by a factor of 12 as @xmath3 increases from 0 to 0.21 . but",
    "this increment is only a factor of 1.4 for the unpolarized case .",
    "the reason for this comes from the fact that the longitudinal cross section has a symmetric behavior in the positive and negative intervals of the parameter but the unpolarized graph shifts a little to the right .",
    "longitudinal polarization also improves the deviations from the sm at both positive and negative values of @xmath4 .",
    "angular distributions of the higgs boson for unpolarized and longitudinally polarized cross sections are given in figs.[fig9 ] and [ fig10 ] .",
    "in the figures @xmath58 is the angle between the outgoing higgs boson and the incoming electron in the center of mass frame of @xmath8 .",
    "angular distributions for other polarization configurations are very similar to the unpolarized cross section .",
    "so we will not give them in the paper .",
    "one can see from fig.[fig10 ] that deviation of the differential cross section from its sm value is larger in the negative interval of @xmath59 .",
    "for a concrete result we have obtained 95% c.l . limits on the anomalous coupling parameters",
    "@xmath60 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 using @xmath61 analysis at @xmath62 and 1 tev and integrated luminosity @xmath63 @xmath1 without systematic errors . in our calculations",
    "we choose to work with a higgs boson of mass 120 gev .",
    "therefore the dominant decay mode should be @xmath64 with a branching ratio @xmath65 .",
    "we assume that w polarization can be measured .",
    "indeed angular distribution of the w decay products has a clear correlation with the helicity states of the w boson .",
    "therefore we consider the case in which w momentum is reconstructible .",
    "we restrict ourselves to a @xmath66 decay channel with a branching ratio @xmath67 .",
    "the number of events are given by @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the _",
    "b_-tagging efficiency and it is taken to be 0.7 as refs .",
    "there have been several experimental studies in the literature for the measurement of w polarization .",
    "w boson polarization has been studied at the cern @xmath70 collider lep2 via the process @xmath71 @xcite . at fermilab tevatron ,",
    "polarization of the w bosons produced in the top quark decay has been measured by the cdf and d collaborations @xcite .",
    "limits on the anomalous _ wwh _ couplings are given in tables [ tab1 ] and [ tab2 ] for various initial and final polarization configurations .",
    "in the tables , @xmath72 is for unpolarized initial beams and tr+lo represents the unpolarized w boson .",
    "we take into account @xmath73 initial polarization configuration which gives the largest deviation from the sm ( figs .",
    "[ fig3]-[fig5 ] ) .",
    "it can be seen from fig.[fig10 ] that deviation of the differential cross section from its sm value is larger in the negative interval of @xmath59 .",
    "so we impose a restriction @xmath74 on the longitudinal polarization configuration to improve the limits .",
    "we represent these restricted limits with a superscript `` * '' .",
    "we see from table [ tab1 ] that polarization leads to a significant improvement on the upper bound of @xmath3 .",
    "polarization improves the upper bound of @xmath3 by a factor of 7.4 .",
    "this improvement factor becomes 9.3 when we consider @xmath74 restriction . at @xmath62",
    "tev these improvement factors are smaller ; we see from table [ tab2 ] that initial state polarization together with final polarization and @xmath75 restriction improve the upper bound of @xmath76 approximately by a factor of 4.3 .",
    "polarization improves both upper and lower bounds of @xmath4 .",
    "improvement factors for upper and lower bounds are the same and equal to 2.2 at @xmath77 tev and 1.9 at @xmath62 tev .",
    "final state polarizations do not improve the lower bound of @xmath3 .",
    "but initial polarizations improve the lower bound of @xmath3 by a factor of 1.7 at @xmath77 tev and 1.6 at @xmath62 tev .",
    "anomalous couplings were studied in @xcite through the same process @xmath0 at the linear order of anomalous couplings and @xmath62 tev energy .",
    "authors took into account initial electron and photon polarizations ( @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) before compton backscattering but they neglected initial electron beam polarization ( @xmath80 ) and also the final state polarization . imposing same acceptance cuts ,",
    "we have confirmed the results of @xcite for all combinations of the initial polarizations @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the unpolarized cross section at the linear order and @xmath62 tev energy is given by      where @xmath82 and coefficient of the parameter @xmath83 is zero at the linear order due to @xmath84 invariance of the total cross section .",
    "@xmath84 is the pseudo - time reversal transformation , one which reverses particle momenta and spins but does not interchange initial and final states .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath83 is @xmath84 odd in the total cross section at the linear order .",
    "therefore only the quadratic order terms for @xmath83 contribute to the cross section . in @xcite authors imposed some cuts and restrict themselves to an appropriate part of the phase space in order to see the effects of @xmath83 .",
    "it is , however , irrelevant for our treatment since we have considered all anomalous terms in our calculations . using cross section ( 9 ) authors set @xmath85 bounds on the anomalous coupling parameters",
    "@xmath86 and @xmath76 with an integrated luminosity of 500 @xmath1 .",
    "if we convert these bounds into 95% confidence level they are approximately @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "we see from table [ tab2 ] that the limit on @xmath89 is very close to the limit at the linear order and quadratic order anomalous contribution leads to a slight improvement . on the other hand , different from the limits at the linear order , limits on @xmath76 are not symmetric .",
    "the lower bound of @xmath3 is improved slightly but the upper bound get worse markedly .",
    "this is very compatible with figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig7 ] where we observe that minima of the unpolarized graphs shift a little to the right .    in conclusion",
    ", polarization leads to a considerable improvement on the upper bound of the anomalous parameter @xmath3 .",
    "it improves both upper and lower bounds of @xmath4 .",
    "although the sm cross sections in the longitudinal polarization configuration of the final w are small , sensitivity limits are better than the transverse polarization case .",
    "as mentioned in @xcite the process @xmath90 can be a good probe to measure the _ wwh _ coupling at high energies .",
    "the disadvantage of @xmath91 is that it also receive contributions from the _ zzh _ vertex and with the final neutrinos being invisible this process has too few observables associated with it .",
    "this makes it very difficult to dissociate _ wwh _ from _ zzh _ @xcite .",
