    "smectic @xmath0 ( sm-@xmath0 ) layers expel twist and bend deformations , just as magnetic fields are expelled from bulk superconductors @xcite . in analogy with the london penetration length , the typical distance to which a magnetic field penetrates into a superconductor",
    ", two penetration depths can be defined in sm-@xmath0 liquid crystals describing respectively the penetration of twist and bend deformations at the edges or around isolated defects of sm-@xmath0 layers .",
    "when a sm-@xmath0 sample is composed of chiral molecules ( molecules without mirror symmetry ) , twist deformations appear intrinsically , driving the formation of novel structures , due to the competition of the twist deformations with the tendency of the molecules to build a perfect twist ",
    "free smectic layer  @xcite .",
    "when the layer forming tendency dominates , the twist is restricted to a band at the layer edge , but when the twist deformations are strong enough , simple flat membranes are replaced by a variety of twisted structures , including twisted ribbons , double helices , arrays of twist walls in membranes , and periodic arrays of pores . in this paper , we study a theoretical model for one result of this basic competition of ordering forces , the transition between flat disks and twisted ribbons .    recently , there have been both experimental and theoretical studies to visualize and quantify the effects of twist and bend deformations on chiral smectic @xmath0 ( sm-@xmath2 ) single - layer membranes in the weak chirality limit , as well as investigating the relative stability of different geometries of membranes seen in experiments .",
    "these membranes are formed under certain conditions in aqueous solutions of filamentous virus particles and a non - binding polymer , which acts to condense the virus particles into dense phases by depletion forces .",
    "al . _ have studied flat sm-@xmath2 monolayer membranes in the form of disks composed of rodlike _ fd _ virus particles to measure the twist penetration length @xmath3 at the edges of the disks @xcite .",
    "the persistence length of these viruses is @xmath4 and the length of @xmath1 viruses was around 1 @xmath5 , making them nearly rigid rods @xcite . because they act like hard rods , the condensed phases they form due to the depletion force are mainly entropy driven @xcite .",
    "these viruses form cholesteric and sm-@xmath2 phases with increasing concentration .",
    "the radii of the disks studied were tens of micrometers . due to the length scale defined by the particle length",
    ", the twist penetration could be visualized using optical microscopy . due to the tilting of the virus particles relative to the layer normal , in the twist penetration region",
    ", the twist could be measured by the resulting change in retardance of transmitted polarized light .",
    "the twist penetration length @xmath3 was determined to be about 0.5 @xmath5 . because the disks were relatively large compared to this , the twist penetration profile fit well to the analytic theory of twist penetration for a semi  infinite membrane , with the director tilting tangential to the edge of the membrane . from the estimated maximum tilt at the disk edge",
    ", the product of penetration length and cholesteric wave vector @xmath6 was estimated as approximately @xmath7 , for the particular sample studied .    in analyzing the energy of the edge of a disk",
    ", there are two important terms , the bare edge energy , or line tension , of the edge , @xmath8 , and the net reduction of free energy in the material near the edge due to the twist penetration .",
    "the line tension is controlled by the concentration of depletant polymer in solution . as this concentration",
    "is lowered , @xmath8 is reduced . in a simple analysis ,",
    "if the second term then becomes larger than the first , then the net energy associated with the edge is negative , and the material will adopt a structure that maximizes the length of edge , relative to the area of flat disk .",
    "this can be achieved in several ways .",

    "the mean free energy density of small sm-@xmath2 disks , which have both twist and bend deformations at the curved disk edge , has been calculated @xcite .",

    "infinite membranes to small disks is affected by the magnitudes of the twist wave vector @xmath6 and the twist penetration length @xmath3 .    rather than simple small disks , a diversity of structures",
    "is observed experimentally to replace large disks as the concentration of depletion agents is lowered @xcite . twisted ribbons ( minimal surfaces to a double helix ) are commonly seen . in this paper",
    "we carry out a mean  field study of the twisted ribbon structure . throughout this work",
    "we assume that the smectic order parameter coherence length @xmath9 is less than @xmath3 , so that the sm-@xmath2 phase is analogous to a type ii superconductor . additionally , we focus here on a model in which twist and bend deformations near the edges of the sm-@xmath2 layers are assumed to be driven by the chirality of the molecules , as a continuation of the previous work @xcite .",
    "we obtain the twist penetration profile as a function of the width of the twisted ribbon .",
    "furthermore , we are able to study the stability of these structures and determine the first  order phase transition from isolated sm-@xmath2 twisted ribbons to semi  infinite flat layers .    the present study is organized as follows : in the next section we introduce our model for the elasticity of smectic @xmath2 membranes and then apply it to twisted ribbons . in sec .",

    "<S> we consider a theoretical model for the chiral smectic @xmath0 twisted ribbons observed in assemblies of @xmath1 viruses condensed by depletion forces . </S>",
    "<S> the depletion interaction is modeled by an edge energy assumed to be proportional to the depletant polymer in solution . </S>",
    "<S> our model is based on the helfrich energy for surface bending and the de gennes model of chiral smectic @xmath0 liquid crystals with twist penetration at the edge . </S>",
    "<S> we consider two variants of this model , one with the conventional helfrich gaussian curvature term , and a second with saddle  splay energy . a mean field analysis of both models yields a first  order phase transition between ribbons and semi  infinite flat membranes as the edge energy is varied . the phase transition line and tilt angle profile </S>",
    "<S> are found to be nearly identical for the two models ; the pitch of the ribbon , however , does show some differences . </S>",
    "<S> our model yields good qualitative agreement with experimental observations if the sign of the gaussian curvature or saddle  splay modulus is chosen to favor negative gaussian curvature . </S>"
