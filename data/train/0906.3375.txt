    "the integer quantum hall effect , with its remarkable transport properties , @xcite offers perhaps the simplest route to understand the complex dynamics of electrons taking place in strongly inhomogeneous nanostructures .",
    "indeed , the presence of a strong perpendicular magnetic field in two dimensions brings the classical motion close to integrability , with slow drift trajectories superimposed to faster cyclotron orbits , leaving hope that the quantum dynamics displays similar and simple structures . @xcite",
    "further simplification is brought by the fact that electron - electron interactions can be taken into account in the integer quantum hall regime at the single - particle level , @xcite so that the calculation of equilibrium properties , such as the local electron density and the distribution of permanent currents throughout the sample , can be carried out from a one - particle random schrdinger equation .",
    "nevertheless , the precise microscopic resolution of this equilibrium one - body problem still lacks a concrete analytical formalism and progress in this direction would be useful toward a microscopic description that underlies more complex nonequilibrium phenomena .",
    "the main difficulty in the resolution of the disordered schrdinger equation resides in the complexity of the potential landscape that competes with the kinetic energy in a nontrivial manner .",
    "in fact , it is worth mentioning that the standard procedure @xcite to deal with a random potential , which consists in averaging over impurity configurations , is already physically questionable at high magnetic fields , at least at the microscopic level .",
    "indeed , this theoretical route is usually justified by the physical assumption of randomness after successive collision events .",
    "however , instead of the chaotic exploration of the disordered landscape , the electronic classical motion becomes relatively regular for a smooth disorder potential at high magnetic fields . at the technical level , this difficulty was pointed out in the standard quantum - mechanical diagrammatic perturbative method , which leads to unsolved complications for a smoothly disordered potential : more and more classes of diagrams must be incorporated in the calculation as the strength of the magnetic field is increased .",
    "@xcite this somehow indicates that the perturbative technique is unadapted for the high magnetic - field regime when the bending of the electronic trajectories becomes too important .",
    "we note already that if one does not resort to any averaging over disorder , one faces not only a technical problem but also a more fundamental physical one , namely , the question of the microscopic origin of irreversibility and intrinsic dissipation from hamiltonian quantum dynamics , an essential aspect for the calculation of transport properties .",
    "indeed , the standard impurity averaging procedure , valid in the limit of low magnetic fields , introduces an effective description of the formalism .",
    "this allows to get , in addition to the energy spectrum , lifetime effects , which are inaccessible in a purely hamiltonian formalism limited to the hilbert space of square integrable functions . in absence of averaging , it is thus necessary to clarify the possible relation between the `` complexity '' of the potential landscape and the issue on the microscopic origin of irreversible processes . in other words , we are confronted with the controversial question whether irreversibility results from supplementary approximations to the fundamental quantum - mechanical laws ( which are strictly time reversible ) or is subtly hidden in the usual formulation of quantum dynamics .    a well - known starting point to capture the regime of quasi - regular dynamics in high perpendicular magnetic fields is to implement in full exact quantum - mechanical terms the fast cyclotron motion of circling electrons resulting from the lorentz force , which gives rise to the quantization of the kinetic energy into discrete landau levels .",
    "the second relevant degree of freedom then corresponds to the slow guiding center of motion , whose dynamics is dictated by the smooth disordered potential landscape .",
    "the essential role of the potential landscape , to be captured precisely in the microscopic quantum - mechanical calculations , is to lift the huge degeneracy of the landau levels .",
    "it is already important to note that the magnetic field @xmath0 enters into the quantum - mechanical problem only via two different quantities : the cyclotron pulsation @xmath1 and the magnetic length @xmath2 .",
    "while @xmath3 is a material - dependent parameter via the effective mass @xmath4 , @xmath5 can be regarded as a more fundamental quantity since it involves only physical constants such as planck s constant @xmath6 , the speed of light @xmath7 , and the absolute value of electric charge @xmath8 .",
    "the cyclotron pulsation @xmath3 determines a characteristic frequency for the circular motion which actually already enters into the problem at the classical level .",
    "in contrast , the magnetic length @xmath5 is purely a quantum - mechanical quantity , especially characterizing the spatial extent of the wave functions . in the popular operatorial language of quantum mechanics ,",
    "these two relevant degrees of freedom are introduced by decomposing the electronic coordinate @xmath9 into a relative position @xmath10 linked to quasicircular cyclotron orbits ( @xmath11 is the velocity operator ) , and a guiding center position @xmath12 .",
    "these quantum variables obey the commutation rules @xmath13=-i\\hbar \\omega_c / m^\\ast$ ] and @xmath14=i l_{b}^{2}$ ] . in close analogy with the canonical quantization rule between the position and the momentum , it is seen that , for the slow drift motion of the guiding center , @xmath15 plays the role of an effective magnetic - field - dependent planck s constant .",
    "the condition of a high magnetic field can thus be imposed either by expressing that @xmath5 is the smallest length scale in the problem , i.e. , by taking @xmath16 , or by considering that @xmath3 is the biggest frequency scale in the problem , i.e. , by taking @xmath17 .",
    "these two limits can in principle be taken separately or simultaneously and actually yield different physical situations which have been discussed in the literature .",
    "@xcite for instance , a popular approach corresponding to the first limit @xmath18 is to treat classically the slow guiding center motion while the fast cyclotron motion is kept quantum mechanical .",
    "@xcite this case leads to great simplifications in the theoretical treatment , since the guiding center coordinates then commute and can be described entirely in classical terms . in this limit",
    ", the guiding center motion is restricted to equipotential lines and the energy spectrum is characterized by a continuous potential energy on top of discrete landau levels .",
    "another standard approximation corresponding to the second limit @xmath17 is to neglect landau level mixing and to study the hamiltonian quantum dynamics at finite @xmath19 projected onto a single landau level .",
    "@xcite this most tricky regime implies to work in a fully quantum - mechanical formalism taking into account rigorously the noncommutativity of the guiding center coordinates .",
    "an interesting aspect that was not fully cleared with both types of approaches lies in how to capture the transition from quantum to classical , with the classical features emerging possibly from microscopic decoherence processes .    in order to study the interplay of landau levels quantization and a smooth disordered potential in a controlled fashion , we have developed @xcite in recent years a specially devoted green s function formalism based on the use of a semicoherent overcomplete set of states",
    "@xmath20 labeled by a continuous quantum number @xmath21 , related to the classical guiding center coordinates , and an integer @xmath22 , associated to the discrete landau levels .",
    "this family of states were named vortex states @xcite due to the vortexlike phase singularity of the associated wave functions @xmath23 at the electronic position @xmath24 . because the vortex states encode no preferred symmetry , they allow a great adaptability to the local spatial variations of the random potential .",
    "more precisely , our approach consists in mapping the quantum equation of motion obeyed by the green s function ( the so - called dyson equation ) to this vortex representation , which then rigorously extends to quantum mechanics the classical guiding center picture .",
    "the main essential difference with the guiding center treatment is that our method keeps the full quantum - mechanical noncommutativity of the guiding center coordinates through the overcompleteness property of the basis of states .",
    "we have shown @xcite that , within the vortex representation , dyson equation can be easily and systematically diagonalized order by order in powers of the magnetic length @xmath5 .",
    "quantum observables are then obtained by returning to electronic representation from the vortex green s functions , so that the semiclassical limit @xmath18 as well as its systematic corrections is naturally obtained with our approach .",
    "@xcite moreover , the vortex representation allows one to classify and include in a systematic and straightforward way the landau level mixing processes in the calculations .",
    "the results to be developed here aim at extending the work initiated in refs .  , where a systematic and closed form expression for the solution of dyson equation in a smooth arbitrary potential was already obtained , under the form of a series expansion classified order by order in powers of @xmath5 .",
    "the further and important step made in the present paper is to include to all orders the contributions from first and second spatial derivatives of the potential , in loose analogy to the resummation of leading classes of feynman diagrams in standard perturbation theory . for simplification",
    ", we will consider the mathematical limit where landau level mixing can be considered negligible and our solution will encompass all cases of quadratic potentials in that limit .",
    "a further motivation for a resummation of the gradient expansion is that the series obtained in powers of @xmath5 may not converge in general , since the semiclassical guiding center limit @xmath18 is expected to be singular , similar to the case of the more standard , fully semiclassical limit @xmath25 .",
    "that the small @xmath19 expansion is indeed singular will be illustrated by the asymptotic character of guiding center semiclassical results : physical aspects related to an exact quantum treatment , such as quantization of energy levels or lifetime effects , can not be approximated by a finite expansion .",
    "we shall confirm this feature by comparing our exact quantum solution to various approximation schemes related to several improvements of the semiclassical guiding center method .",
    "before diving into the heart of the technique , we want to mention that , although our method obviously shares on certain aspects some similarities with theories already existing in the literature , important differences with these prior works can be emphasized .",
    "first , we would like to stress that our methodology is based on the exclusive use of green s functions , not wave functions , in contrast to the theory pioneered by girvin and jach @xcite ( see also refs . ) where a one - dimensional ( 1d ) schrdinger s equation for the electron dynamics projected onto a single landau level ( valid in the limit @xmath17 ) was derived for finite @xmath5 .",
    "this point could appear superfluous at the first glance , since it is possible to get green s functions from the knowledge of wave functions .",
    "however , the use of an overcomplete representation with nonorthogonal states to solve the dynamical equations of motion necessarily forces us to give up the wave functions picture and work in a green s function formalism of partially coherent states .",
    "furthermore , it is worth noting that the hilbert space of square integrable wave functions is usually well suited for closed integrable systems , but turns out to be totally inadequate in situations presenting scattering processes in open systems ( case of a saddle - point potential for instance ) , where one must appeal to another formalism , the scattering states picture .",
    "we shall show that the use of an overcomplete representation of coherent states allows one to get and treat quantization and lifetime effects on an equal footing in the resolution of dyson equation .",
    "moreover , the appearance of lifetimes in the energy spectrum coincides with the impossibility to describe the solution of the dyson equation in terms of a countable set of states , thus proving the relevance of an overcomplete @xcite representation in such a situation .",
    "second , we note that several authors @xcite actually attempted to build theories based on the use of vortex states within the path - integral formalism , which , however , seemed to suffer from technical difficulties that were not elucidated .",
    "@xcite in contrast , our theory is not tainted with the specific mathematical ambiguities which can often be encountered with the path - integral technique .",
    "the derivation of an exact solution for the green s function at large cyclotron energy yet finite magnetic length , embracing all possible cases of quadratic potentials , constitutes the main mathematical result of this paper . besides capturing exactly the tunneling processes in the case of a saddle - point potential , it has the virtue of pointing out clearly the physical microscopic mechanism responsible for the appearance of lifetimes in the spectral decomposition of the hamiltonian .",
    "we therefore hope that it will also help to clarify the debate about the physical roots of time irreversibility and the ubiquitous emergence of a classical character from quantum mechanics .",
    "an important point we will also demonstrate is that the derived solution provides a controlled approximation at finite temperature for all equilibrium local observables in the case of an _ arbitrary _ potential that is smooth on the scale of the magnetic length .",
    "this result , based on the fact that the local green s function at high magnetic fields displays a hierarchy of energy scales controlled by successive spatial derivatives of the potential , can be used to write down an expression for the local density of states which may be useful in the context of recent scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements .",
    "@xcite a short report of parts of this work has been published in ref . .",

    "these difficulties in identifying the physical roots of irreversibility rely essentially on the fact that the microscopic dynamical equations are time reversible , whereas complex macroscopic systems are always characterized by a time - asymmetric evolution .",
    "consequently , it is generally believed that irreversibility arises from the macroscopically large number of degrees of freedom affecting the time evolution of a nonisolated system .",
    "@xcite    there have been many different approaches to derive an irreversible dynamical evolution starting from the schrdinger equation .",
    "the most popular one @xcite is to consider the microscopic ( integrable ) system as a part of a larger hamiltonian system which has many degrees of freedom ( the environment or reservoir ) .",

    "other possibilities are to solve quantum - mechanical equations by dealing directly with tractable models of the environment , such as the consideration of a collection of harmonic oscillators .",

    "the rigged hilbert space is just an extended space consisting of the hilbert space equipped with distribution theory and was originally introduced into quantum mechanics to give a mathematical justification of dirac s bra - ket formalism .",
    "it establishes rigorously that the spectral decomposition formula acquires meaning in the continuous spectrum as well as in the discrete spectrum , and allows the appearance of complex eigenvalues .",
    "plane - wave eigenvectors , which are generalized eigenvectors in the space of tempered distributions , are basic examples of these elements of the rigged hilbert space which do not live in the hilbert space .",
    "they are routinely used in the scattering states formalism , which contains an arrow of time hidden in the choice of time asymmetric boundary conditions : the consideration of in- and out- plane wave states asymptotically far from the scattering region is indeed a statement of causality expressing the fact that the state at a given position is determined by the action of a source at a retarded time . note that causality",
    "is naturally accounted for in the definition itself of the retarded and advanced green s functions .",
    "however , in this case , the presence of the infinitesimal quantity @xmath52 in the dynamical equations [ see eq .",
    "( [ greenevol ] ) ] does not automatically imply a broken time symmetry for the physical states .",
    "for this , one needs in addition to have a dynamical instability occurring in an unconfined system , i.e. scattering events .    the introduction of a continuous ingredient plays an important role in all microscopic derivations of irreversible processes . with the consideration of asymptotic in- and out - plane wave states ,",
    "the scattering formalism presupposes the existence of a continuum via the presence of reservoirs , so that irreversibility finally acquires within this approach an extrinsic character .",
    "moreover , this formalism is specifically limited to open systems , thus antagonistic to the hilbert space quantum mechanics of closed systems . in this paper",
    ", we have shown that , by using an overcomplete representation of coherent states belonging to the hilbert space such as the vortex states , it is possible to embed quantum theory in a wider formalism of which hilbert space quantum mechanics of closed systems would become a special case . moreover , in this approach quantization effects and lifetime effects are naturally treated on the same footing .",
    "the continuous ingredient is contained into the overcompleteness property of the chosen set of quantum numbers . as a price to pay",
    "when working in a coherent states representation , it requires giving up the wave functions as the fundamental quantity of quantum theory and replacing them by green s functions .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the overcompleteness does not necessarily imply a loss of information and time symmetry breaking . for this , we need in addition an instability of dynamical motion related , e.g. , to the presence of saddle points in the potential landscape . in this case , the overcompleteness of the representation @xcite is necessary to obtain a solution of the spectral problem .",
    "the basic reason is that the crossing of the equipotential lines at the saddle - point energy ( which schematically looks like a collision process and can be seen as a bifurcation of a path ) together with the openess of the system destroys the trajectory as well as the hilbert space description .",
    "therefore , the phenomenon of instability somehow imposes to deal directly with probabilities to describe the dynamical evolution of the physical states ( which necessarily belong to the hilbert space ) .",
    "it is worth noting that we then obtain a description which from the point of view of its structure is isomorphic to classical mechanics .",
    "we have seen that irreversibility arises as a selection principle from the time - invariant hamiltonian .",
    "the states selected by the unstable dynamics appear thus to be less symmetric than they would seem to follow from the hamiltonian description .",
    "this situation is actually reminiscent of the well - known spontaneous symmetry breaking as it occurs in ferromagnetism . in the presence of a dynamical instability ,",
    "bra and ket vortex states describe just physically distinct states .",
    "finally , we note that a critical ingredient to obtain the time symmetry breaking in our solution is to consider quantum tunneling within an infinite system , i.e. , unconfined spatially ( otherwise , the physical quantum numbers describing the dynamics are necessarily discrete and the evolution unitary ) .",
    "in this paper , we have built a green s function formalism based on the use of an overcomplete semicoherent vortex representation to study the electron quantum dynamics in high magnetic fields and in a smooth potential landscape . within this formalism",
    ", we have shown that it is possible to derive in a _ controllable way _ approximate quantum expressions , e.g. , for the local density of states , for an arbitrary potential smooth at the scale of the magnetic length . moreover , we have obtained in the limit of negligible landau level mixing an exact expression for the electronic green s function which encompasses all possible cases of quadratic potentials .",
    "we have argued that this generic result , which is rendered possible by the use of an overcomplete representation of states belonging to the hilbert space , is a manifestation of a stability property of the vortex quantum numbers .",
    "we have shown that the overcompleteness feature of the vortex representation does not introduce de facto a loss of information , since we are able to reproduce the solutions for the exactly solvable ( integrable ) cases of parabolic 1d and 2d confining potentials , which can be obtained by standard wave function calculations .",
    "in contrast , we have found that a loss of information , associated with the introduction of a probabilistic description of the physical processes , and concomitant with the appearance of lifetimes ( synonymous of time symmetry breaking ) , arises in the saddle - point quadratic potential model .",
    "the vortex representation turns out to be especially relevant in this latter case of quadratic potential by providing in the limit of negligible landau level mixing exact physical insight into the quantum tunneling processes originating at the saddle point .",
    "therefore , we have explicitly proved that time irreversibility does not result from supplementary approximations to the hamiltonian formalism of quantum mechanics , but just naturally arises in the spectral decomposition of the hamiltonian from the formulation of dynamics in this overcomplete vortex representation of states . with the present analysis",
    ", we deduce that the minimal necessary ingredient to get solutions from the hamiltonian formalism which exhibit a broken time symmetry is to have an instability of the single - particle dynamics , as occurring from quantum tunneling at the saddle points of the potential landscape , which manifests itself in an unconfined ( thus open ) system . therefore , besides permitting to capture the transition from quantum to classical in an efficient way , the overcompleteness property of the representation allows the introduction of an intrinsic irreversibility on the microscopic level .",

    "<S> this property results from the fact that the overcomplete vortex representation provides a more general type of spectral decomposition of the hamiltonian operator than usually considered . whereas confining potentials are naturally characterized by quantization effects , lifetime effects emerge instead in the case of saddle - point potentials . </S>",
    "<S> our derivation proves that the appearance of lifetimes has for origin the instability of the dynamics due to quantum tunneling at saddle points of the potential landscape . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the overcompleteness of the vortex representation reveals an intrinsic microscopic irreversibility of the states synonymous with a spontaneous breaking of the time symmetry exhibited by the hamiltonian dynamics . </S>"
