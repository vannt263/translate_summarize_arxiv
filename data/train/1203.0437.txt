    "carbon atoms can create a variety of forms such a graphite , diamond , carbon fibers , fullerenes and carbon nanotubes .",
    "a carbon nanotube can be described as a graphene sheet rolled into a cylindrical shape so that the structure is one - dimensional with axial symmetry and in general exhibiting a spiral conformation called chirality .",
    "they are interesting because of their unique mechanical and electronic properties  @xcite . from the pioneering works  @xcite ,",
    "the electronic properties of graphite have attracted interest because of unconventional physical properties of a graphite layer . the development in the fabrication of the single layers of graphite ( graphene )  @xcite caused a striking level of interest in the investigation of the carbon compositions .",
    "in addition to the closed carbon molecules  @xcite , systems with boundaries also show interesting features .",
    "the nanographite zig - zag ribbon possesses localized edge states near the fermi level .",
    "states like that are absent for ribbons with armchair edges  @xcite .",
    "the graphite sheet is a zero - gap semiconductor with the density of states(dos ) vanishing at the fermi level , the edge states of the zig - zag ribbons produce a peak in the dos at the fermi level . both the carbon nanotubes and graphite layers have the edge states because of their boundary .",
    "the presence of the edge state results in the relatively important contribution to the density of states ( dos ) near the fermi energy .",
    "it was found  @xcite that the homo - lumo ( highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital , respectively ) gap is inversely proportional to the length of the zig - zag carbon nanotube segment .",
    "the zig - zag ribbons have partly flat bands at the fermi level  @xcite . in the presented paper ,",
    "we focus on the computation of the electronic spectra of the zig - zag bilayer strip and also on the computation of the dos of the edge states near the fermi level .",
    "firstly , we describe the model for the zig - zag bilayer strip . we will study the edge and size effects using the tight - binding model for this strip shown in fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] .",
    "the @xmath0 electronic structures are calculated from the tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the site energies of the upside and down layer ; @xmath5 , @xmath6 are @xmath0 the orbitals on site @xmath7 at the upside and down layer ; @xmath8 , @xmath9 are the intralayer hopping integrals ; @xmath10 are the interlayer hoping integrals which depend on the distance @xmath11 and angle @xmath12 between the @xmath13 and @xmath14 orbitals .    to describe the parameter which characterizes the zig - zag bilayer strip , we start from the graphene layer where we can define the vectors connecting the nearest neighbor carbon atoms in the form : @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17    the distance between atoms in the unit cell is @xmath18 .",
    "we want to find a solution to the double - layer graphene strip in the form : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 we want to find a solution to the above equation in the form of the bloch function @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes @xmath24 or @xmath25 atoms . here",
    "@xmath26 , @xmath27 is the position of a unit cell and @xmath28 is the number of a unit cell ; @xmath29 is a @xmath30 orbital .",
    "we denote @xmath31 @xmath32 now we define the intratube hopping integrals as @xmath33 .",
    "we take into account only the interaction between nearest - neighbors also in the case of interlayer interaction and denote @xmath34 in confining the structure along the width , the edge states are induced by terminating the width dimension with zig - zag shaped edges .",
    "the presence of edges in the bilayer strip changes the dimensionality of the system from a two - dimensional to a one - dimensional system .",
    "the electronic spectrum of the zig - zag bilayer strip can be described by the following system of equations : @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 where @xmath39 here @xmath40 , are site indices , where @xmath41 describes the width of the graphene bilayer .",
    "we assume that the @xmath42 and @xmath43 sites are missing .",
    "so we have the boundary condition @xmath44 .",
    "the solution is assumed to be  @xcite @xmath45 @xmath46 here @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the coefficients which have to be determined , and @xmath49 is the transverse wave number . from the boundary condition we have @xmath50 @xmath51 and so @xmath52 @xmath53 where @xmath54 .",
    "and similarly ,    @xmath55    @xmath56    substituting eqs.([4.11]-[4.12a ] ) into eqs.([4.1]-[4.4 ] ) we obtain @xmath57c+\\ ] ] @xmath58 @xmath59a+(e+\\delta)\\left(e^{ipm}-e^{-ipm}\\right)c=0,\\ ] ] @xmath60a'+\\ ] ] @xmath61 @xmath62c'+(e+\\delta)\\left(e^{ipm}-z^{2}e^{-ipm}\\right)a'=0.\\ ] ]    this homogenous system of equations has a solution only if the following conditions are fulfilled : @xmath63e^{2ipm}+\\ ] ] @xmath64e^{-2ipm}-\\ ] ] @xmath65 or @xmath66e^{2ipm}+\\ ] ] @xmath67e^{-2ipm}-\\ ] ] @xmath68    the coefficient of @xmath69 terms and the constant term have to be equal to zero .",
    "thus , we obtain the energy spectrum @xmath70 @xmath71 and the equation which gives the longitudinal wave number @xmath49 is @xmath72+\\frac{g_{k}}{\\gamma_{0}}\\sin\\left[p(m+1)\\right]=0.\\ ] ] for @xmath73 eq.([4.18 ] ) can be written as @xmath74=0.\\ ] ] the solution is given by @xmath75 substituting this solution into eq.([4.16],[4.16a ] ) we get the energy spectrum for the graphene bilayer with the periodic boundary condition along the y - axis .",
    "now we are interested in the edge state of the graphene bilayer .",
    "this solution can be obtained in the form @xmath76",
    "we get the following equation for @xmath77 : @xmath78-\\frac{g_{k}}{\\gamma_{0}}\\sinh\\left[\\eta(m+1)\\right]=0.\\ ] ] the edge state can exist when the condition @xmath79 is fulfilled . the energy spectrum of a state like that is given as    @xmath80    @xmath81    for big enough @xmath41 the solution of eq.([4.23 ] ) can be expressed in the form  @xcite @xmath82,\\ ] ] where @xmath83 .",
    "we denote @xmath84 . from eq.([4.26 ] ) we have @xmath85 and so    @xmath86    @xmath87    now we assume , similarly as in  @xcite , that @xmath88 and also it is assumed that the width of the graphene bilayer is big enough and the following condition is fulfilled : @xmath89 the bands are given by @xmath90 @xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath93 we are interested in the @xmath94(@xmath95 ) band which is the valence(conductance ) band of the edge states .",
    "the minimum of the @xmath94 band is @xmath96 where it was used that @xmath97 for @xmath98 and also eq.([4.23a ] ) .",
    "we found @xmath99 .",
    "similarly for the @xmath95 band    @xmath100    and @xmath101 .",
    "we can see that the width of the band is inversely proportional to the width of the bilayer .",
    "the density of states can be expressed in the form @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the length of the bilayer in the @xmath104 direction .",
    "we get the density of the state in the region @xmath105 in the vicinity of the energy @xmath106 in the form @xmath107 the density of the state in the region @xmath108 in the vicinity of the energy @xmath106 has the form @xmath109 both these densities of the states have a singularity at the energy @xmath106 .",
    "the strength of the singularity depends also on the width of the bilayer .",
    "the width of the bilayer is characterized by the parameter @xmath41 .",
    "the density of the state of the @xmath110 band is the same as the @xmath111 band .",
    "in the presented paper the electronic spectra of the zig - zag bilayer strip was studied analytically .",
    "we get for big enough @xmath41 that the electronic spectra of the graphene bilayer strip are similar to the spectra of the graphene bilayer with the periodic boundary condition . because of the boundary we also get edge states .",
    "it was shown that the width of the edge state band is inversely proportional to the width of the bilayer strip which is characterized by the parameter @xmath41 .",
    "so for big enough @xmath41 we get partly flat bands of the edge states .",
    "the density of states at the fermi level has a singularity which also depends on the width of the bilayer strip .",
    "there is asymmetry in the dos at the fermi energy , similarly to the electron - hole asymmetry in the bilayer graphene  @xcite .",
    "this asymmetry is caused by the parameter @xmath112 which describes the difference in the site energy of the atoms at the sites @xmath113 and the atoms at the sites @xmath114 .",
