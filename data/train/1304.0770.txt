( in prep . ) , investigates the luminosity function of carla - selected candidate galaxy cluster members .",

    "a key goal of the carla survey is to investigate how environment depends on agn classification , and we therefore have targeted a matched sample of unobscured ( e.g. , type-1 ) and obscured ( e.g. , type-2 ) radio - loud agn .",
    "type-1 agn , specifically broad - lined quasars or rlqs for the high - luminosity , radio - loud sources targeted here , show signatures of radiation originating from very close to the central black hole .",
    "in contrast , the central black hole is obscured by dense absorbing material in type-2 agn , or hzrgs for the high - luminosity , high - redshift , radio - loud sample observed here . in the standard agn unification model @xcite this obscuration is produced by an optically thick circumnuclear torus and differences in optical appearance only depend on the orientation angle at which the agn is observed , not due to intrinsic differences between the two agn types .",
    "a clear prediction is that both agn types should reside in identical environments .",
    "recently , an alternative paradigm has been gaining attention in which type-2 agn evolve into type-1 agn as their merger - triggered , dust - obscured agn become more powerful and clear out the environment ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "this dynamical model would mean that type-1 and type-2 agn trace different phases in the evolution of powerful agn , potentially associated with different environments .",
    "on the other hand , if the timescale associated with the agn breaking out of its obscuring cocoon is much shorter than the timescale on which the environment develops , then no dependence of environment on agn type would be expected in the dynamical model .",

    "these two radio surveys cover a very large part of the extragalactic sky , and have well - matched spatial resolution , thereby avoiding concerns with missing flux .",
    "the rest - frame 500mhz frequency was deliberately chosen to ensure that the fluxes were interpolated rather than extrapolated between the two radio surveys .",

    "to create the rlq sample , we selected all optically bright ( @xmath35 ) quasars in the sloan digitized sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ? * ) and the 2df qso redshift survey ( 2dfqz ; * ? ? ? * ) , where the spectroscopy - based classifications were taken from the original catalogues .",
    "for the sdss quasars the @xmath36 were taken from the original catalogue , and for the 2df quasars we calculated @xmath36 from the original catalogs assuming a quasar sed represented by a power law ( @xmath37  as used for the sdss quasars ) and we corrected for galactic dust extinction .    to identify rlqs , we then correlated this sample with the nvss using a 10  search radius . as only @xmath3820% of the rlqs",

    "moreover , rlqs may contain time - variable , doppler beamed emission , which would render the spectral indices from surveys observed several years apart unreliable .",
    "we therefore assumed a fixed @xmath39 for all rlqs to calculate their @xmath32 .",
    "we tested and justified this choice by computing the mean and median value for the 133 out of 717 rlqs where the vlss - nvss spectral indices could be derived , and find @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively . on average , the radio luminosities calculated with a fixed @xmath42 only differ from the precise radio luminosities by @xmath43% and this scatter will not have any influence on our results and conclusions .",

    "the density of the environments around the rlqs seems to be more dependent on redshift than those of the hzrgs with probabilities of 99.0% and 83.0% of a correlation , respectively .",
    "however , this could be due to slightly different sampling at intermediate redshifts . if galaxy ( proto-)clusters have the same number of members at all redshifts , a dependence with redshift would be expected as we observe galaxies that are about 3 magnitudes fainter than @xmath101 at @xmath102 but only galaxies that are @xmath38 2 magnitudes fainter than @xmath101 at @xmath103 .",

    "( in prep . ) uses the carla sample to quantitatively examine the redshift evolution of the cluster luminosity function .",
    "the fact that we observe a dependence with redshift demonstrates that a non - negligible fraction of the irac - selected objects in the vicinity of the radio - loud agn are associated with the agn .",
    "if the irac - selected sources were not associated with the radio - loud agn then their density would likely be independent of the agn redshifts .",
    "figure [ d_radio ] shows how the density of the carla fields depends on the radio luminosity of the targeted radio - loud agn .",
    "spearman rank correlation coefficients do not show a significant dependence of the carla field densities on @xmath32 .",
    "this is in agreement with previous studies at these high radio luminosities @xcite and is consistent with expectations from the unified model for agn @xcite .",
    "we discuss this result in the context of other studies at lower redshifts in section 6 .",
    "we also test the difference of the density distributions between the hzrg and rlq fields as a function of radio luminosity .",
    "we fit a gaussian to the density distribution in four radio luminosity bins ( @xmath104 w hz@xmath105 w hz@xmath106 w hz@xmath107 w hz@xmath26 , chosen to provide similarly sized samples ) to determine the mean and sigma of the histograms .",
    "two - sided k - s tests do not show a significant probability for the distributions to be different .",
    "spearman rank correlation coefficients do not imply a dependence of the density on radio luminosity for either of the two types of agn .",
    "it has long been debated whether the environments of radio - quiet agn are any different from their radio - loud analogs .",
    "many studies show that radio - quiet agn , which are usually associated with less massive spiral galaxies , are less clustered than radio - loud agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "several theories have been proposed to explain this difference between the environments of radio - loud and radio - quiet agn .",
    "one theory , known as jet confinement , posits that the higher igm densities in regions of higher galaxy densities enhance synchrotron losses from radio jets , thereby making them brighter @xcite .",
    "an alternative theory suggests that mergers in regions of higher galaxy density will produce more rapidly spinning supermassive black holes , which will then be more capable of powering a radio jet ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "regardless , observational results suggest that radio - quiet agn reside in less dense environments while the difference between rlq and rg environments still remains an open issue and observations show inconclusive results .    from a study of @xmath38 30 radio - selected agn at @xmath108 , @xcite finds that rlqs and rgs at @xmath109 were similarly clustered , consistent with the results of @xcite based on a comparably sized sample at similar redshift ( see tab .",
    "[ hzrg_rlq ] ) . @xcite studies the environments of 75 rlqs and 27 rgs at @xmath57 , and finds a small , but notable trend of density with agn type , with the rg environments being slightly denser than the rlq environments .",
    "he suggests , however , that this might be due to the different sample sizes .",
    "@xcite computes the cross - correlation signal between a sample of @xmath38 14,000 radio - detected agn and a sample of 1.2 million luminous red galaxies in the sdss .",
    "they also study a sample of @xmath38 300 rlqs cross - correlated with the same sample of luminous red galaxies . when comparing the two clustering signals",
    ", @xcite finds the rgs are more clustered than the rlqs for @xmath110 w hz@xmath26 , but clustered in a similar way for @xmath111 w hz@xmath26 .",
    "we caution the reader that in each study different lower limits and definitions of radio - loudness are being used . in tab .",
    "[ hzrg_rlq ] we summarize the results of these works and list the redshift ranges and the lower limit on radio luminosity used to define a radio - loud object .",
    "the radio luminosities have been converted to @xmath32 assuming a radio spectral index of @xmath39 @xcite . at lower radio luminosity , @xmath112 w hz@xmath26 ,",
    "the studies show somewhat conflicting results .",
    "a concerning problem is the small sample sizes providing poor statistics and with imperfectly matched samples . in @xcite ,",
    "for example , the rgs were slightly more radio luminous than the rlqs .    at low radio luminosities ,",
    "our understanding of the environments of rlqs and rgs is not yet clear . at higher radio luminosities , @xmath113 w hz@xmath26 , previous studies and our analysis",
    "agree that there are no significant differences between the environments of type-1 and type-2 agn .",
    "these results are consistent with the popular orientation - driven ( e.g. , obscuring torus ) agn unification scenario for the most powerful type-1 and type-2 radio - loud agn . however , at lower radio luminosities , other factors , such as agn feeding mechanisms , appear to come into play causing less powerful radio - loud type-1 and type-2 agn to , on average , reside in different environments .",
    "we have studied the environments of 387 radio - loud quasars and radio galaxies at @xmath24 that have been observed at @xmath114 m and @xmath115 m with the _ spitzer space telescope_. our study clearly confirms that radio - loud agn reside in rich environments . by applying a color cut , we identified likely high - redshift galaxies , which we refer to as ` irac - selected sources ' , and computed their surface density in a @xmath116 radius around the radio - loud agn .",
    "more than half of the fields , 55.3% , are overdense at the 2 @xmath8 level when compared to the blank field density of irac - selected sources derived from the spuds survey .",
    "if we instead consider a 5 @xmath8 overdensity , 9.6% of the fields are overdense .",
    "we detect a significant rise in surface density of irac - selected sources towards the position of the radio - loud agn in contrast to a homogeneous radial surface density distribution for the spuds apertures .",
    "this reassures us of an association of the majority of the irac - selected sources with the radio - loud agn .",
    "these carla results provide a promising list of high - redshift galaxy ( proto-)cluster candidates for further study .",

    "we discuss how this trend can be explained in the context of the evolution of the luminosity / mass function of galaxy clusters .",
