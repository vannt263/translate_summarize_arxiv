    "4u 1728 - 34 is a well known prototype of the class of the bursting atoll sources ( @xcite ) .",
    "this was one of the first sources to display khz qpos in its power spectrum and the first one to display burst oscillations , around 363 hz , during some type i x - ray bursts ( @xcite ) .",
    "its temporal behavior has been recently extensively studied ( @xcite , @xcite ) using a large set of rxte observations , spanning more than three years .",
    "spectral studies have been carried out in the past with the use of exosat ( @xcite ) , rxte ( @xcite ) and bepposax ( @xcite , @xcite ) satellites ; although there was a general agreement about the modelization of the continuum emission , it was disputed the nature of local features , especially a broad gaussian line at 6.2 - 6.7 kev .",
    "the distance to the source is estimated between 4.1 kpc and 5.1 kpc ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper we present the results from a simultaneous chandra - rxte observation of 4u 1728 - 34 .",
    "we propose an alternative fit of the iron k - shell region , using two absorption edges instead of a broad emission line , whose interpretation would be quite problematic .",
    "4u 1728 - 34 was observed by chandra on 2002 march 4 for a total collecting time of @xmath5 ksec .",
    "we used the chandra high energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs ) to perform a high resolution spectroscopic analysis .",
    "the data were collected in the timed exposure mode , and a sub - array was adopted ( q = 1 and n = 400 , see the chandra proposer s observatory guide at ) in order to mitigate the effects of photon pile - up for first order spectra .",
    "consequently the frame time was 1.44 s , the high energy grating ( heg ) spectrum is cut below 1.6 kev and the medium energy grating ( meg ) spectrum below 1.2 kev .",
    "no systematic error was added to the data .",
    "the rxte observation started on 2002 march 3 03:27:12 and ended on 2002 march 5 13:00:00 .",
    "for the spectral analysis we used only the proportional counter units 2 and 3 data in the standard2 configuration ( with 16 s time resolution and 129 energy channels ) .",
    "seven type - i bursts were revealed in the pca lightcurve and two bursts in the chandra lightcurve . as our primary concern is to focus on the persistent emission of the source we discarded data around each burst , for a time length of 160 s.    as concerns the chandra hetg data , we considered the four first - order dispersed spectra , namely the two heg spectra and the two meg spectra on the opposite sides of the zeroth order .",
    "we averaged heg+1 ( meg+1 ) and heg-1 ( meg-1 ) spectra in a single spectrum , after having tested their reciprocal consistency .",
    "the used energy range is 1.6 - 10 kev for the heg spectrum and 1.2 - 5 kev for the meg spectrum .",
    "for all the fits we took into account an instrumental feature at 2.07 kev for bright sources ( described by @xcite ) and fit it with an inverse edge ( with optical depth @xmath6 ) .",
    "the heg and meg spectra were binned in order to have at least 300 counts for each bin .",
    "this , however , still ensures a high number of channels ( about 1000 ) and good spectral resolution throughout the entire covered energy band . concerning the rxte",
    "/ pca data the standard selection criteria for obtaining the good time intervals were applied .",
    "we restricted the spectral analysis to the temporal intervals during which rxte operated simultaneously with chandra .",
    "we limited the energy range to 3.5 - 35 kev , and applied a 2% systematic error for channels below 25 kev and 2.5% for channels above 25 kev .",
    "relative normalizations of the three instruments , except for heg which was fixed to a reference value of 1 , were left as free parameters in all the fits performed .",
    "we tried a series of models to simultaneously fit heg , meg and rxte spectra .",
    "we found the best - fit model to consist of a soft emission , described by a blackbody of temperature @xmath7 0.52 kev , plus a comptonized component ( comptt in xspec , @xcite ) , where the seed photon temperature kt@xmath8 is @xmath7 1.3 kev , the electron temperature kt@xmath9 is @xmath7 7.4 kev and , finally , the optical depth @xmath10 associated to a spherical corona is @xmath7 6.2 .",
    "both components are photo - electrically absorbed by an equivalent hydrogen column @xmath11  @xmath12 .",
    "the associated @xmath13/d.o.f . obtained for this fit is 1206/1034 .",
    "we noted an evident absorption edge around 1.84 kev , probably associated to neutral si , in the meg and heg spectra . to fit this edge we substituted the component",
    "_ phabs _ in xspec with the component _ vphabs _ , which allows us to vary the abundances of single elements with respect to the solar abundances . we found that leaving the si abundance free improves the fits significantly ; si resulted overabundant by a factor @xmath14 2 with respect to the solar abundance ( @xmath13/d.o.f .",
    "value obtained for this fit is 1031/1033 ) .",
    "large residuals at 610 kev can be fitted by a very broad gaussian emission line ( @xmath15 kev , corresponding to a fwhm @xmath1 kev ) , whose interpretation is quite problematic , or , alternatively , by absorption edges associated with fe i and fe xxv at @xmath16 kev ( @xmath10 @xmath7 0.11 ) and @xmath3 kev ( @xmath10 @xmath7 0.16 , respectively .",
    "the addition of these edges improves the fit significantly compared to the simple model described above ( giving a decrease of @xmath13/d.o.f . from 1031/1033 to 959/1029 ) . in this interpretation",
    ", we find no evidence of broad , or narrow fe k@xmath4 line , between 6 and 7 kev . to test the consistency of our model we reanalyzed a previous bepposax observation performed between august 23 and 24 , 1998 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a gaussian emission line is no longer statistically required if we introduce two absorption edges at energies above 7 kev .",
    "we found a first edge at @xmath7 7.4 kev ( @xmath10 @xmath7 0.08 ) and a second edge at @xmath7 8.7 kev ( @xmath10 @xmath7 0.06 ) .",
    "we found a general agreement with the chandra - rxte spectrum , obtaining @xmath13/d.o.f .",
    "= 225/179 ( instead of @xmath13/d.o.f .",
    "= 236/178 obtained for the model adopted in @xcite ) . in table 1 and figure 1 we present the results of the two fits of the bepposax and chandra - rxte datasets .",
    "we confirm that the best - fit continuum model for this source is composed of two components : a blackbody emission which probably comes from the inner edge of an accretion disk around the compact object , and a comptonized component coming from a hot corona surrounding the system .",
    "although we can not definitely exclude that a quite broad gaussian line ( @xmath15 kev , fwhm @xmath1 kev ) is present in this source , we present here a different interpretation of the residuals in the iron k - shell region .",
    "these are well fitted by two absorption edges at energies at @xmath17 and @xmath3 kev , associated with fe i and fe xxv , respectively ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we derived , however , an upper limit to the flux of a broad emission line , fixing the values of energy and width to the values found in @xcite ; we find an upper limit to the line flux of @xmath18 erg @xmath12 sec@xmath19 ( corresponding to an equivalent width of 28 ev ) .",
    "we checked that this alternative model is also in agreement with a previous bepposax observation .",
    "we observe a shift in the energy of the fe i edge from 7.1 kev during the chandra - rxte observation to 7.4 kev ( compatible with k@xmath4 edges of moderately ionized iron , fe ix to fe xvi ) during the bepposax observation , while the energy of the fe xxv edge is consistent with being the same in both observations .",
    "finally we found , both in the chandra - rxte and bepposax spectra , a si overabundance by a factor @xmath20 with respect to the solar abundance and the values obtained from the fit are consistently in agreement .    .",
    "best fit parameters for the two datasets of 4u 1728 - 34 , obtained from a bepposax observation ( 0.12 - 60 kev energy band ) and a joint chandra - rxte observation ( 1.2 - 35 kev energy band ) .",
    "the continuum emission consists of a thermal blackbody ( bbody ) and a comptonized component modeled by comptt . @xmath21 and n@xmath22 are , respectively , the blackbody temperature and normalization in units of @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the luminosity in units of @xmath25 ergs / s and @xmath26 is the distance in units of 10 kpc .",
    "@xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath10 indicate the seed - photon temperature , the electron temperature and the optical depth of the comptonizing cloud around the neutron star .",
    "n@xmath29 is the normalization of the comptt model in xspec v.11.2.0 units .",
