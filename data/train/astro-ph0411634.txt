    "the study of the muon fluxes in the atmosphere is currently of great interest because of the correlation between the muon and neutrino fluxes .",
    "atmospheric neutrinos are produced from the decay channels of pions and kaons and the subsequent muon decay .",
    "the production of electron and muon neutrinos is dominated by the processes @xmath0 followed by @xmath1 ( and their charge conjugates ) , with a similar chain for charged kaons .",
    "when all particles decay , there will be two muon neutrinos for each electron neutrino resulting in an expected ratio @xmath2 of the flux of @xmath3 to the flux of @xmath4 of about 2 .",
    "the experimental measurements @xcite indicate , however , that the ratio of muon to electron neutrinos in the atmosphere is significantly smaller than two .",
    "this disagreement with theoretical predictions has been interpreted in terms of neutrino oscillations @xcite . in order to calculate precisely the neutrino oscillation parameters one has to know the neutrino flux at production . because of the close connection beteween the neutrinos and the muons , a standard test of codes used for calculating the neutrino flux is to calculate the muon flux with the same procedure and compare it to measurements of muons .",
    "our approach here is related but somewhat different .",
    "we calculate only the muon flux , and we use the comparison with measurements to probe two aspects of the input that are common to both the neutrino and the muon fluxes .",
    "the calculation of both muons and neutrinos starts with the primary spectrum outside the atmosphere .",
    "therefore uncertainties in the measurements of the primary spectrum of protons , helium and heavier nuclei affect both fluxes in a similar way .",
    "because the uncorrelated fluxes depend essentially on energy per nucleon , heavy nuclei have relatively little effect , and the largest uncertainty in normalization comes from protons and helium .",
    "experimental measurements of primary proton and helium spectra in some cases show significant differences from each other .",
    "we find that it is possible to divide the experimental data over a fairly large energy range into two groups : group 1 corresponds to the data wich give a lower flux and group 2 to a higher flux . by making a  high \" fit and a  low \" fit over an extended energy range",
    ", we can define a reasonable range where the primary spectum should lie .",
    "comparison with measured muon fluxes may provide an extra constraint on the normalization of the primary flux .",
    "treatment of the geomagnetic field affects both the neutrino and the muon fluxes .",
    "one effect is a consequence of the field acting on the primary cosmic rays , which determines allowed and forbidden trajectories .",
    "primaries on allowed trajectories reach the atmosphere to interact and produce secondary muons and neutrinos while those on forbidden trajectories do not reach the atmosphere and therefore do not contribute to secondary fluxes .",
    "the other significant effect is the bending of charged muons after production in the atmosphere . which trajectories are allowed and which forbidden depends both on magnetic rigidity ( defined as total momentum divided by charge of the nucleus ) and on the direction of the particle . at high geomagnetic latitudes all primaries with energies above pion production threshold",
    "are allowed . at low latitudes ,",
    "particles need to have a minimum rigidity to reach the atmosphere , and this minimum value is higher for positive particles from the east than from the west .",
    "we investigate the sensitivity of the muon fluxes to both aspects of the geomagnetic field as a function energy and atmospheric depth .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ s : thesimulations ] is divided in three subsections . in [ s : airshowers ] we report on the method used to calculate the atmospheric muon fluxes ; in [ s : seast ] we describe the treatment of the geomagnetic field ; and in [ s : input ] we propose the high and low fits of the primary proton and helium spectrum data .",
    "the results are reported in [ s : results ] and finally we summarize our conclusions in section [ s : conclusion ] .",
    "in this work we have used the air shower simulation program ( aires ) @xcite , which provides full space - time particle propagation and accounts for the atmospheric density profile @xcite and the earth s curvature .",
    "the particles taken into account by aires in the simulation are : gammas , electrons , positrons , muons , pion , kaons , lambda baryons , nucleons , antinucleons and nuclei up to z=36 .",
    "the hadronic processes are simulated using different models , according with their energy .",
    "high energy collisions are processed invoking an external package , sibyll or qgsjet ( sibyll 2.1 @xcite or qgsjet01 @xcite ) , while low energy ones are processed using an extension of the hillas splitting algorithm ( ehsa)@xcite . in this work we use sibyll .",
    "the threshold energy separating the low and high energy regimes is 200 gev .",
    "the effect of the geomagnetic field ( gf ) inside the atmosphere is taken into account in aires .",
    "the gf calculations are controlled from the input instruction by specifying a date and the geographic coordinates of a site .",
    "the program uses the igrf model @xcite to evaluate the magnetic field intensity and orientation .",
    "it is assumed that the shower develops under the influence of a constant and homogeneous field which is evaluated before starting the simulations .",
    "the input used in the simulation and the procedure to calculate the flux is the same as that used in ref @xcite . in ref  @xcite the caprice experimental geomagnetic transmission function was used to estimate the cutoff prior to the calculation of the muon flux .",
    "here we use a more precise backtracking method , as described in the next subsection .",
    "the magnetic field affects the low energy muon flux both through the geomagnetic cutoffs on the primary cosmic rays , including the east - west effect , and by the bending of trajectories of secondary charged particles inside the atmosphere .",
    "the east - west effect is the suppression of cosmic ray nuclei incident on the atmosphere from the east compared to those from the west .",
    "this suppression is due to the combination of the following two facts @xcite @xcite :    - : :    positively charged particles at the same zenith angle have a higher    cutoff from the east direction than from the west ( and vice - versa for    negatively charged particles ) since some of their trajectories    intersect the earth .",
    "- : :    cosmic rays are positively charged nuclei , so they will bend in one    sense in the geomagnetic field .    to calculate these geomagnetic effects we use backtracking technique in a detailed , time - dependent geomagnetic field model ( igrf , international geomagnetic field model ) .",
    "this technique consists of the integration of the equation of motion of a particle with the opposite charge starting at a position near the top of the atmosphere .",
    "we inject antiprotons outwards from an altitude of 100 km in various directions and see if the backtracked antiproton reaches a distance of 30 r@xmath5 from the earth within a total pathlength of 300 r@xmath5 .",
    "any direction in which an antiproton of a given momentum can reach this distance is an allowed direction from which a proton of the opposite momentum can arrive .",
    "the backtracked antiprotons that do not reach that distance are either trapped in the geomagnetic field or their trajectories intersect the surface of the earth . in these last two cases the trajectory",
    "is considered forbidden .",
    "the results are expressed in terms of a transmission function , also called penetration probability , which is zero at low rigidity and increases to one at higher rigidity .",
    "the energy dependence of the transmission function depends on the geomagnetic latitude and the angle between the cosmic ray direction and the geomagnetic field lines .",
    "the geomagnetic cutoff is treated in the simulation by the application of this function to the input primary cosmic ray flux ,    to explore the east - west effect we have compared two transmission functions , one averaged over primaries inside a cone of half angle 30@xmath6 from the east and the other over a similar cone from the west .",
    "the caprice geomagnetic transmission function @xcite used in ref .",
    "@xcite was obtained by comparing the shape of the spectra of alpha particles measured by the balloon borne experiment caprice94",
    "@xcite with the shape of caprice98  @xcite .",
    "these two balloon experiments flew in different locations : the first in lynn lake , manitoba , canada , where the geomagnetic cutoff is negligible , and the other in ft .",
    "summer new mexico ( usa ) where the vertical cutoff is 4.3 gv .",
    "this transmission function is only a function of rigidity and therefore does not produce the east - west effect .",
    "we compare the two methods in section  [ s : results ] below .",
    "new measurements of the primary spectra of protons and helium have improved our knowledge of the primary spectrum up to 100 gev compared to what was previously known .",
    "there are nevertheless still significant discrepancies between different experiments .",
    "for this reason we have performed two different fits : one with the experiments that give the lowest ( we will call them group 1 ) and another that give the highest fluxes ( group 2 ) . all these measurements were fitted to the following function :        group 1 consists of the data of caprice98 @xcite , atic @xcite @xcite below 100 gev and runjob  @xcite @xcite at high energy .",
    "group 2 consists of the data of ams @xcite  @xcite , bess @xcite at low energy and jacee @xcite at high energy ( there was not a considerable difference between ams - jacee and bess - jacee fit for the protons fluxes ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] we show the combination of the experimental data on the proton fluxes for the experiments of group 1 ( left ) and for group 2 ( right ) .",
    "three different fits are shown in the left - hand panel .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the fit of all the data .",
    "we have also made separate fits for the low energy data ( the dashed line ) and for the high energy data ( the dotted line ) .",
    "the left hand side of the figure  [ fig : fig1 ] shows the proton data from ams with full circles , bess with open circles and jacee with stars .",
    "we have done two fits for the following two groups ams - jacee ( solid line ) and bess - jacee ( dashed line ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig2 ] shows the helium experimental data for group 1 ( left ) and group 2 ( right ) . for group 1 we have made two fits with different values of b and c. for group 2 there is a considerable difference between the data of ams and jacee .",
    "this is not the case in a combination of bess and jacee data .",
    "for this reason we performed two different fits but implement in the calculation the bess - jacee data fit .",
    "the parameters for the fluxes of group 1 and group 2 are shown in table  [ table : exp ] . to have a clear picture in figure  [ fig : fig3 ] we show three different fits of the absolute fluxes of proton ( left ) and helium ( right ) that we will use in this calculation ( group 1 , group 2 and that of ref ."
