    "absorption - line measurements of metal abundances , physical conditions , and kinematics of diffuse gas in well - constrained locations of the outer milky way ( e.g. , savage et al .",
    "1995 ) are relatively rare , particularly near the plane of the galaxy ( wakker 2001 ) .",
    "such measurements can provide unique insights into galaxy evolution for several related reasons :    first , the chemical enrichment patterns at large galactocentric distances , and the corresponding implications regarding the galactic abundance gradient , are fundamental observables that can be compared to theory in order to understand a variety of processes that affect the evolution of a galaxy ( e.g. , chiappini et al . 2001 ; carigi et al .",
    "for example , the processes by which galaxies acquire gas and fuel new star formation are not entirely understood , and this has become a key question in current galaxy evolution studies .",
    "recent theoretical work has indicated that gas accretion might not occur through a spherical accretion shock as traditionally envisioned but instead could occur in a `` cold mode '' in which the matter flows into galaxies in filaments that radiatively cool and never approach the virial temperature ( katz et al .",
    "2003 ; kere et al .",
    "2005,2009 ; birnboim & dekel 2003 ) . to test models of gas accretion",
    ", it is necessary to measure the properties of incoming matter in various locations .",
    "some of the models indicate that accreting matter can have substantial angular momentum and could settle into the outer disk ( e.g. , kere et al .",
    "2005 ) , a hypothesis that has some support from recent observations ( moran et al .",
    "2012 ) . in this case",
    ", it is also important to probe how the incoming gas is transported into the inner disk to enable new star formation or even central black hole growth and activity ( hopkins & quataert 2010 ) .",
    "conversely , star formation can generate galactic fountain _ outflows _ that remove enriched matter from the inner galaxy .",
    "some of outflowing material could escape entirely , but it is also probable that some of this enriched matter will return to the outer disk and add to the matter reservoir for subsequent star formation ( e.g. , bregman 1980 ; oppenheimer et al . 2010 ; lehner & howk 2011 ) . these competing inflow and outflow processes should have significantly different abundance signatures : inflowing intergalactic matter should have relatively low metallicity while the outflowing fountain material is expected to be metal enriched , and indeed , low - redshift observations have shown that halo gas can be remarkably metal - poor ( e.g. , tripp et al . 2005 ; ribaudo et al .",
    "2011 ) as well as highly enriched ( e.g. , jenkins et al . 2005 ; prochaska & hennawi 2009 ; tripp et al .",
    "thus , these flows should have opposite effects on galactic abundance gradients , and ultimately a complete galactic evolution model should be able to explain observed metallicities in both the inner and outer regions of a galaxy . similarly , it is important to constrain the microphysics of inflowing / outflowing matter  how ( and where ) are the flows ionized , ablated , and mixed into the general ism ? how do they subsequently cool to reach conditions suitable for new star formation ?",
    "some galactic wind models drive the outflows by radiative pressure and may require significant quantities of dust in the outflowing material ( aguirre et al . 2001 ; murray et al . 2011 ) .",
    "absorption - line measurements can reveal the presence of dust in the outer galaxy through abundance patterns indicative of depletion onto dust grains ( e.g. , savage & sembach 1996 ; jenkins 2009 ) , so outer - galaxy absorption studies can also shed insight on the roles played by dust in inflows and outflows .",
    "second , absorption - line observations of damped ly@xmath3 absorbers [ dlas ; qso absorbers with @xmath4 ( ) @xmath5 @xmath6 ) and sub - dlas ( @xmath7 ( ) @xmath8 provide sensitive probes of the chemical enrichment history of the universe from @xmath9 to @xmath10 ( e.g. , prochaska et al . 2003",
    "; wolfe et al . 2005 , meiring et al .",
    "2009,2011 ) , but the context of the dlas ( i.e. , the environment and nature of the absorbers ) is generally hard to study , and currently only limited information is available regarding the origins of dlas ( e.g. , chen & lanzetta 2003 ; rao et al .",
    "2003 ; battisti et al .",
    "2012 ) . considering the cross section of a disk or halo of gas ,",
    "it is likely that many of the dlas arise in the outer regions of galaxies .",
    "the milky way is a damped ly@xmath3 absorber .",
    "since its absorption context can be scrutinized in great detail , the milky way provides a valuable laboratory for understanding the nature of dlas / sub - dlas , but measurements of abundances patterns in the more distant _ outer _ galaxy are still relatively limited .",
    "third , while some abundances in the outer galaxy and abundance gradients have been measured using region emission lines , there has long been concern about whether region abundances are biased by `` self pollution '' , i.e. whether the abundances are boosted by freshly formed metals from massive stars embedded within the region .",
    "abundances from absorption lines in distant background objects probe random locations with respect to foreground regions and can test the self - pollution hypothesis , and some absorption - line studies have indeed suggested that self pollution does occur ( cannon et al .",
    "2005 and references therein ) .",
    "the discovery that many gas - rich galaxies have `` extended ultraviolet disks '' ( thilker et al . 2007 ) underscores the importance of investigating this issue  regions may be biased in favor of the uv - bright star clusters that comprise the extended uv disks and might not accurately represent abundance gradients for testing theoretical work as discussed above .",
    "fourth , outer galaxy abundances can be used to investigate whether some gaseous structures of the milky way could be due to interactions with satellite galaxies .",
    "this is related to the questions raised above : one means to bring gas into galaxies is to strip the interstellar media of dwarf satellite galaxies as they plunge into , and merge with , the central galaxy .",
    "satellite interactions can also stimulate the growth of galactic structures such as warps ( e.g. , weinberg & blitz 2006 ; quillen et al . 2009 ) and may drive continuing ( low - level ) star formation in elliptical galaxies ( kaviraj et al .",
    "since satellite galaxies can have significantly different abundances compared to each other and the galactic disk , the outer galaxy abundances provide clues about the origins of galactic structures and the importance of this mechanism for bringing additional gas into galaxies .    for these reasons",
    "we have conducted a study of the abundances in the outer galaxy using absorption lines recorded in high - resolution spectra of two qsos observed with the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ and the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse)_. we selected two qsos for this study , hs0624 + 6907 and h1821 + 643 .",
    "these sight lines are unique among the qsos and agns that have been in observed in the ultraviolet at high spectral resolution and with good signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratios because the qsos are at relatively low galactic latitudes and thus provide an opportunity to study outer - galaxy gas near the plane .",
    "moreover , these qsos lie behind a high - velocity gaseous structure with a large angular extent in the outer galaxy known as the `` outer arm '' ( oa ) .",
    "this structure is also unique because its distance has recently been constrained , which is valuable for understanding its nature and implications .",
    "in addition , there are several high - velocity cloud complexes near the oa with similar kinematics , including complexes c , g , and h. the _ hst _ archive includes high - quality spectra of many stars in the directions of these gas clouds , and these stellar spectra provide an opportunity to obtain new constraints on the distance of these objects . in this paper , we present a study of these outer - galaxy gaseous structures .",
    "we focus on the abundances and physical conditions in the outer arm and whether the oa is related to the hvcs in its proximity . in ",
    "[ outerarmnotes ] , we provide some comments on the outer arm and the qso sight lines that probe this part of the galaxy .",
    "we present the qso and star observations and absorption - line measurements in ",
    "[ obssec ] and   [ absmeas ] , respectively , and we discuss new constraints on the distance of the outer arm , and the nearby high - velocity cloud complex g , in   [ distance_section ] . in",
    "  [ ionabun ] , we examine the physical conditions of the oa , and we use models to evaluate the impact of ionization corrections on the metallicity measurements .",
    "we also make some remarks on the nature of the highly ionized gas in the outer arm .",
    "we discuss our results in ",
    "[ disc ] with an emphasis on the possible origin and implications of the outer arm .",
    "the outer arm is a large , contiguous neutral hydrogen complex located in galactic coordinates at @xmath11 and @xmath12 over a velocity range @xmath13 km s@xmath14 .",
    "figure  [ outerarm ] shows an all - sky map of high - velocity 21 cm emission from wakker et al .",
    "( 2003 ) including the outer arm .",
    "the structure has long been known from 21 cm emission studies ( e.g. , westerhout 1957 ; kepner 1970 ; burton & te lintel hekkert 1986 ) , and it is often interpreted to be gas in the outermost galactic spiral arm and/or the warped region of the outer disk at a galactocentric distance @xmath15 15 kpc ( e.g. , kepner 1970 ; diplas & savage 1991 ; haud 1992 ) . however , whether this gaseous structure is really a spiral arm has long been questioned ( e.g. , davies 1972 ; weaver 1974 ) , and other hypotheses regarding the nature of this object remain viable .",
    "the oa extends to substantial latitudes ( figure  [ outerarm ] ) , which implies a large @xmath16height that may difficult to reconcile with an origin in the galactic warp , and in some regions it exhibits large deviations from galactic rotation speeds ( e.g. , wakker 2001 ) that are problematic for the spiral arm interpretation .",
    "indeed , recently obtained contraints on the oa distance and kinematics ( lehner & howk 2010 ) call into question whether this gas cloud is indeed related to the galactic warp and outer spiral arm ( see below ) .",
    "moreover , the similarity of the kinematics and distance of the oa and the nearby hvcs complex c and complex g ( see  [ distance_section ] ) suggests that the oa and complexes c and g ( and possibly h ) could be related .",
    "such a complex configuration of hvcs would not be expected in the warp / spiral arm interpretation .",
    "the 21 cm emission from the outer arm is detected at velocities similar to expected velocities for a rotating galactic disk in this general direction , and consequently , the oa is often ignored in studies of galactic hvcs , although it is included in the hvc compendium of wakker ( 2001 ) .",
    "recently , lehner & howk ( 2010 ) have used the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) on _ hst _ to detect the oa in ultraviolet absorption lines toward hs1914 + 7139 ( @xmath17 ) , a b2.5 iv star at an estimated heliocentric distance of 14.9 kpc .",
    "interestingly , _",
    "they detect oa absorption toward this star at two velocities _ , @xmath18 and @xmath19 km s@xmath14 .",
    "this observation places an upper limit is listed here . ] on the distance to the oa : the galactocentric radius @xmath20 kpc .",
    "this is in agreement with the distance typically derived for the oa , assuming it is part of the galactic warp , i.e. , @xmath15 15 kpc ( haud 1992 ) . the oa component at @xmath18 km s@xmath14 is roughly consistent with corotation at the usually adopted oa distance , although this velocity implies that the oa should be at a galactocentric radius that is @xmath21 kpc farther out than the @xmath22 upper limit .",
    "the other velocity component detected by lehner & howk , @xmath23 km s@xmath14 , is more interesting : this velocity is highly inconsistent with a rotating - disk origin ; corotating disk gas would be far beyond the star at this velocity , even with the increased milky way rotation speed derived by reid et al .",
    "a small portion of the oa shows 21 cm emission at velocities near @xmath19 km s@xmath14 ( see figure 1 in tripp et al .",
    "2003 ) , but mostly the oa is not detected at this velocity in 21 cm emission .",
    "however , the hvc complex c , which is close to the oa as shown in figure  [ outerarm ] , has a pervasive and highly extended `` high - velocity ridge '' at @xmath24 km s@xmath14 ( tripp et al .",
    "this high - velocity ridge has a similar morphology to the lower - velocity part of complex c and is almost certainly a component of complex c. the discovery by lehner & howk that the outer arm has a similar higher - velocity component at @xmath24 km s@xmath14 suggests that the oa and complex c could be closely related . that the higher - velocity part of the oa is not apparent in most of the 21 cm emission map likely indicates that the column density in the @xmath23 km s@xmath14 component is too low to be detected in 21 cm emission .",
    "the @xmath23 km s@xmath14 component is significantly weaker in the uv absorption lines than the @xmath18 km s@xmath14 component ( see figure 1 in lehner & howk 2010 ) , which is consistent with its absence in the 21 cm emission map .",
    "all together , these observations suggest that complex c and the oa ( and possibly some of the other nearby hvcs ) could have a common origin , and the gas becomes more highly ionized and ablated approaching the plane , an idea which is supported by the / ratios in complex c ( tripp et al . 2003 ; sembach et al .",
    "2003 ) as well as its morphology in high - resolution maps ( hsu et al . 2011 ) .",
    "however , other explanations remain viable .",
    "for example , the hvcs with higher absolute velocities tend to be more highly ionized , and it is possible that as the hvcs approach the disk , they are decelerated and compressed , and the increased density from compression moves the gas into a less ionized state .",
    "the highly anomalous velocity observed by lehner & howk indicates that the oa is truly a high - velocity cloud . if the oa is an outer spiral arm or part of the galactic warp , then a mechanism to produce the high - velocity ( @xmath19 km s@xmath14 ) component must be identified .",
    "moreover , the striking similarity of the outer arm and complex c , both at the `` main '' hvc velocity and in the high - velocity ridge , must be explained .",
    "if complex c and the outer arm are really related , then the oa might not be a spiral arm , and it is worthwhile to investigate other possible origins for this large cloud .",
    "we note that in this case , the `` outer arm '' shown in figure  [ outerarm ] may be a different entity , at least in part , than the outer arm on the far side of the galaxy ( e.g. , strasser et al . 2007 ; dame & thaddeus 2011 ) , which is observed at lower latitudes and lower velocities .",
    "ultraviolet absorption lines provide a powerful means to learn about the nature of the outer arm .",
    "to probe the nature of the oa using uv absorption spectroscopy , we present below a study of two bright low - redshift qsos , h1821 + 643 ( @xmath25 ) and hs0624 + 6907 ( @xmath26 ) , lying in galactic directions that pierce the outer arm ( figure  [ outerarm ] ) .",
    "the sight line to the bright , low - redshift quasar h1821 + 643 ( @xmath27 ) has been often used in studies of the galactic and intergalactic medium ( e.g. , savage et al .",
    "1995,1998 ; tripp et al .",
    "2000,2001 ; oegerle et al .",
    "2000 ; narayanan et al .",
    "2010 ) , and consequently there are high - quality , high - resolution uv spectra of this target available from the _ hst _ and _ fuse _ archives . hs0624 + 6907 was included in the survey of tripp et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , and thus high - quality uv spectra are also available for this sight line .    a number of stars in the general direction of the outer arm ( and its adjacent hvcs )",
    "have also been observed with high resolution and high s / n with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) on _ hst_. we will examine the stis spectra of these stars to bolster the oa distance constraints from lehner & howk ( 2010 ) . for reference , we overplot the locations of the targets on the 21 cm emission map of the outer arm from the leiden / argentine / bonn ( lab ) survey ( kalberla et al . 2005 ;",
    "kalberla & haud 2006 ) in figure  [ zoommap ]",
    ". we will show below that the hvc complex g , which has similar kinematics to complexes c and h and the outer arm ( see figure  [ outerarm ] ) , is at a similar distance as the oa and complex c. to aid this discussion , we also show the location of complex g in figure  [ zoommap ] along with the locations of two stars that constrain its distance . from figure  [ zoommap ] ,",
    "it is difficult to judge if the two stellar sight lines ( hd40893 and hd43818 ) at the high - longitude tip of the oa are truly in the direction of this cloud . however , as shown in figures  [ highl_1 ] and [ highl_2 ] , the lab spectra in the directions of these stars clearly show 21 cm emission at the oa velocity , and we will show below that uv absorption is detected at oa velocities in the spectrum of hd 43818 (  [ distance_section ] ) .",
    "we note that hd43818 is in a direction where milky way gas is known to exhibit kinematic complexity ( e.g. , burton & moore 1979 ) including the `` anticenter shell '' ( e.g. , heiles 1984 ) .",
    "it has been argued that this structure is not a coherent shell ( e.g. , tamanaha 1997 ) , and we agree : the positive - latitude portion of the anticenter shell connects contigously in space and velocity with the outer arm , and the negative - latitude part is a component of a large and distinct complex of hvcs with a much larger angular extent than the original anticenter shell ( see figure 1 ) .",

    "moreover , we will show evidence below that even the oa absorption itself is composed of closely spaced narrow components .",
    "consequently , we use the voigt - profile fitting software of fitzpatrick & spitzer ( 1997 ) , including the effects of the stis line - spread function ( proffitt et al .",

    "the outer arm absorption toward h1821 + 643 has been studied previously by savage et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and tripp et al .",

    ", we compare the apparent column density profiles of selected species in figure  [ h1821nav ] , and we plot expanded absorption profiles in figure  [ fig_multicomp ] .",
    "several features in these figures provide evidence of multiple components in the oa velocity range .",

    "for example , both of the profiles in panel ( a ) of figure  [ h1821nav ] show a consistent edge at this @xmath84 , and the and profiles ( panel c ) exhibit the same feature . such a sharp discontinuity can not occur in a profile due to a single voigt component .",
    "instead , this feature requires at least one narrow component near @xmath118 km s@xmath14 that is blended with another component at @xmath119 km s@xmath14 .",
    "in fact , we can see from the @xmath1201608.45 and @xmath1201526.71 lines ( panel b ) that there are indications of three components in the oa : a narrow feature at @xmath121 km s@xmath14 and a broader component at @xmath122 kms@xmath14 ( in addition to the component causing the sharp edge at @xmath118 km s@xmath14 ) . to show this a different way",
    ", we compare in figure  [ fig_multicomp ] a single - component fit to a three - component fit of the oa absorption profiles of @xmath1201608.45 and @xmath1201670.79 .",
    "the three - component fit is superior , both for fitting the sharp edge at @xmath118 km s@xmath14 and for fitting the detailed component structure at @xmath119 kms@xmath14 . the @xmath123 statistics for the fits indicate that the one - component fits are acceptable but the three - component fits are better .",
    "for example , for the @xmath1201608.45 line , the reduced @xmath123 for the single - component fit is @xmath124 = 1.08 while the three - component fit has @xmath124 = 0.93 .",
    "we note that we have also explored whether two - component fits might be favored .",
    "we find that the two - component fits provide no improvement compared to one - component fits ; in this case , the profile - fitting code converges to a solution that is virtually identical with the one - component model with the same @xmath124 .",
    "three components are required to improve the fit to the sharp edge and the narrow core of the profiles .",
    "based on the consistent evidence in multiple profiles , we have elected to revise the profile fits published previously , and our results from fitting three components to the absorption lines detected in the oa are summarized in table  [ tab : h1821 ] .",
    "interestingly , many of the line widths indicated by the fits are relatively narrow , which potentially has implications regarding the physical conditions of the gas (  [ ionabun ] ) .",
    "we note that it can be difficult to extract reliable line widths from strongly blended components , but the presence of the sharp edge in many of the absorption profiles requires a narrow component in many of the species .",

    "we note that most of the oa metals in table  [ tab : h1821 ] are not saturated , and the column densities summed over the three components or determined from a single component are quite similar and are robust .",
    "perhaps even more interesting is the indication of a similarly narrow component in the profiles of the highly ionized species and ( see figure  [ h1821vel ] ) .",
    "a narrow feature can be seen consistently in the @xmath1251393.76 , 1402.77 doublet at @xmath117 km s@xmath14 ; to show this we again plot the doublet , with single - component and a three - component fits overlaid , in the lowest panels in figure  [ fig_multicomp ] . in the high ions ,",
    "this narrow feature is offset to somewhat more negative velocities than in the low ions , but it is clearly present .",

    "as discussed above , the new constraint on the distance to the outer arm from lehner & howk ( 2010 ) raises a question about the nature of this gas cloud .",
    "however , this constraint is derived from a single sight line through a highly extended object ( see figures  [ outerarm ] - [ zoommap ] ) . as we commented above , the kinematic similarity and spatial proximity ( projected on the sky ) of the oa and complex c ( and other outer - galaxy hvcs ) suggests a possible connection .",

    "however , complex c has been shown to be at a heliocentric distance of @xmath135 kpc ( wakker et al .",

    "2008 ) , or a galactocentric radius of @xmath136 kpc for the three directions in which is has been detected toward stars .",
    "therefore , the outer arm and complex c have similar radial distances and their three - dimensional locations are also consistent with a common origin .",
    "as shown in figures  [ outerarm ] @xmath129 [ zoommap ] , the oa has a large angular extent , so it is not difficult to find bright stars at a variety of distances in its direction . to more tightly constain the location and nature of the oa , in this section we present a minisurvey for oa absorption toward stars .",
    "there are many high - quality ultraviolet spectra of stars in its general direction in the _ hst _ archive .",
    "we have selected a set of stars from the _ hst _ archive that have been observed with one of the stis echelle modes at high - s / n ratio .",

    "the continuum - normalized absorption profiles of strong interstellar lines of and from the spectra of these stars are plotted in figure  [ starlimits ] along with one of the interstellar lines from the h1821 + 643 and hs0624 + 6907 spectra for comparison .",
    "we show both the and lines in figure  [ starlimits ] because while the lines are advantageous because they are the strongest low - ionization metal lines and thus are the most sensitive probes of low - density clouds , they are also disadvantageous because they often saturate strongly and consequently completely hide the sight line component structure .",
    "this component structure can be recognized in the weaker lines while still retaining good sensitivity to low - column clouds .",
    "several examples of these advantages and disadvantages are apparent from comparisons of the and profiles in figure  [ starlimits ]",
    ". measurements of ( and upper limits on ) @xmath4 ( ) and @xmath4 ( ) derived from the stellar data are listed in table  [ distance_tab ] . as expected , the limits are more stringent ; comparing the column - density measurements and limits in table  [ distance_tab ] with galactic ism measurements in various contexts ( see , e.g. , tripp et al .",
    "2002 , their  4 and appendix ) , we see that the limits are often well below the column densities typically detected in the disk of the milky way , and the limits are less constraining .",
    "several interesting results are evident from the information in figure  [ starlimits ] and table  [ distance_tab ] :    first , the outer arm is clearly detected in absorption toward one star , hd43818 . as shown in figure  [ hd43818detect ] , c  ii and si  iii absorption is nicely detected and well - aligned with the oa 21 cm emission in this direction .",
    "two uv absorption components are evident near the oa velocity ; the column densities , @xmath116values , and centroids of these components , measured by voigt - profile fitting as discussed above , are listed in table  [ tab : oa_meas ] . the velocities ( @xmath137 ) of the uv absorption and 21 cm emission are somewhat lower than the @xmath137 values in other parts of the oa , but the oa is known to have a velocity gradient with decreasing @xmath137 values in this region ; the velocities are consistent with an origin in the outer arm . of the nine stellar sight lines that we have examined toward the oa ,",
    "the hd43818 sight line is the second - most distant target in both heliocentric distance and galactocentric radius ( see table  [ distance_tab ] ) , so it is perhaps not surprising that the oa is detected toward this target but not the others .",
    "this indicates that the oa is beyond the closer stars but in front of hd43818 , i.e. , in the galactocentric radius range of 9 @xmath138 10.4 kpc .",
    "while the absence of uv absorption toward hd40893 would seem to be inconsistent with this result since hd40893 is at @xmath139 kpc , we note that the 21 cm emission is substantially weaker toward hd40893 ( compare figures  [ highl_1 ] and [ highl_2 ] ) , and the lower column density toward hd40893 could cause the uv absorption to slip below the detection threshold .",
    "moreover , the sight lines to hd40893 and hd43818 are relatively close on the sky , and the significant differences in the lab 21 cm profiles towards these stars indicates that the oa is a clumpy structure .",
    "considering the beam size of the lab data ( see kalberla et al .",
    "2005 ) , it is possible that the hd40893 sight line pierces a very low - density region of the oa .",
    "for this reason , it would be valuable to obtain follow - up observations of additional distant stars in the general direction of the oa .",
    "oegerle et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have searched for oa absorption in _ fuse _ spectra of the central star of the planetary nebula k1 - 16 , and the nondetection of the oa toward k1 - 16 places a similar constraint , @xmath140 kpc .",
    "this change is very small and has no impact on our discussion . ]",
    "k1 - 16 is particularly useful because this sight line is only 85  from the h1821 + 643 sight line , and it also probes the oa at a greater @xmath127 height than most of the other stellar sight lines .",
    "second , considering the intermediate - velocity components at negative velocities seen toward h1821 + 643 , we clearly detect these clouds in the spectra of hd207198 , hd208440 , and hd209339 ( this is most easily seen in comparison of the profiles in figure  [ starlimits ] ) . the velocity centroids and relative line strengths of these features in the stellar sight lines are quite similar , but not identical , to those of the h1821 + 643 intermediate - velocity lines . the variations of the intermediate - velocity lines from sight line to sight line are not too surprising given the angular separations between the stars and the qso .",
    "these variations could provide interesting constraints on the nature of these clouds , particularly for the stellar sight lines , which are relatively close in the sky .",
    "the velocities of these features suggest that they are affiliated with the perseus spiral arm , and in principle , these sight lines can be used to probe gas flows affiliated with the perseus arm .",
    "these intermediate - velocity lines are tangential to this paper , so we defer further analysis of the intermediate - velocity clouds to a future study .",

    "context , oxygen should be only weakly affected by depletion onto dust ( savage & sembach 1996 ; jenkins 2009 ) , so this oxygen abundance is a good representation of the overall gas - phase metallicity of the outer arm .",
    "abundances of other elements are more difficult to measure toward h1821 + 643 .",
    "the primary problem is that many species can require significant ionization corrections , and it is also possible that some species are depleted onto dust grains . as we will argue below",
    ", the oa absorption lines likely arise in cool gas .",
    "therefore the gas is predominantly photoionized , and we can assess ionization corrections using photoionization models . for this purpose , we have the photoionization code cloudy ( ferland et al .",
    "1998 ) to calculate various ion column densities as a function of the ionization parameter @xmath170 (= ionizing photon density / particle density ) . in figure  [ h1821model ]",
    "we show the predicted column densities for all of the species that we have detected toward h1821 + 643 ( table  [ tab : h1821 ] ) , assuming that the gas is photoionized by the ionizing uv flux field in the outer milky way as calculated by fox et al .",
    "( 2005 ) with an intensity of @xmath171 at 1 rydberg .",
    "as expected , @xmath4 ( ) is flat over the plotted @xmath170 range in figure  [ h1821model ] because it tracks precisely as the gas ionization changes , but the columns of other species , with the exception of , increase as the gas becomes more ionized because those ions can remain present in ionized gas that contains very little . behaves like and is coupled to the , but the  coupling is weaker .",
    "we can roughly constrain the ionization parameter of the gas by requiring the model to match the observed columns of the species that are lightly depleted by dust , and .",
    "the / ratio indicates that log @xmath172 . at this value of @xmath170 ,",
    "the model @xmath4 ( ) is 0.5 dex higher than the observed column .",
    "in fact , the observed can not be reconciled with this model at all because this would require a high value of @xmath170 , and , as can be seen from figure  [ h1821model ] , this would cause the model to predict unacceptably high column densities of , , and ; such a model is ruled out by the measured column densities of these species .",
    "this high@xmath173 model would also produce far more and than is observed .",
    "we conclude that nitrogen is underabundant .",
    "nitrogen underabundance is also observed in the nearby hvc complex c ( richter et al .",
    "2001 ; tripp et al . 2003 ; collins et al . 2007 ) .",
    "we also notice from figure  [ h1821model ] that , , and are all somewhat overpredicted by the model at this @xmath170 .",
    "these elements are all prone to depletion by dust , so this could indicate that there is a small amount of dust in the oa which removes some of the si , al , and fe from the gas phase and hence causes the observed columns to be somewhat lower that the model predictions .",
    "alternatively , by choosing a lower model ionization parameter , it is possible to fit the , , and columns without requiring any dust depletion , but in this case the observed @xmath4 ( ) would significantly exceed the model column ( see figure  [ h1821model ] ) .",
    "such an excess of has no obvious explanation ; it is more likely that the preferred model with log @xmath172 is correct and there is some depletion of si , al , and fe .",
    "turning to the hs0624 + 6907 data , we find that , ironically , the higher column creates some difficulties because more of the available metal lines are saturated (  [ hs0624meas ] ) .",
    "in addition , the hs0624 + 6907 data are noisier and cover fewer lines . for this sight line",
    ", we must mainly rely on to estimate the gas - phase metallicity .",
    "this species can exist in ionized as well as neutral gas , so we must consider the impact of ionization on the derived metallicity .",
    "figure  [ hsmodel ] shows a photoionization model analogous to the h1821 + 643 model but adjusted to match the column observed toward hs0624 + 6907 . from this figure",
    ", we see that we the ionization parameter is more loosely constrained in this case .",
    "however , we can exclude large ionization parameters because if @xmath170 is too high , the model will predict and column densities that exceed the observations .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ hsmodel ] shows the maximum ionization parameter allowed by this model without exceeding the observed high - ion columns .",
    "the upper limit on the ionization parameter indicates that the ionization corrections for can not be large , and the implied outer arm metallicity toward hs0624 + 6907 is [ m / h ] @xmath174 , similar to the metallicity obtained from the h1821 + 643 data . in this case , the column is close to the predicted value while and are somewhat underabundant and , again , may be modestly depleted by dust .",
    "the upper limit on the metallicity is derived from the model shown in the left panel of figure  [ hsmodel ] . in this case , as the ionization parameter is decreased , the ionization corrections become negligible and the curves all become flat . in this case , the column indicates that the metallicity is [ m / h ] = @xmath175 , very similar to the h1821 + 643 metallicity , and the iron and aluminum must be moderately depleted .",
    "we noted in  [ h1821measurements ] that the h1821 + 643 absorption profiles of low ions show clear evidence of three components in the outer arm , and two of these components are required to be narrow .",
    "in addition , while there is clear correspondence between the low ions and more highly ionized gas traced by and ( see figures  [ h1821vel ] , [ h1821nav ] , and [ fig_multicomp ] ) , the and profile shapes are not identical to those of the low ions .",
    "there are consistent offsets between some of the low- and high - ion centroids , and the high ions appear to be be broader in the @xmath176 km s@xmath14 component .",
    "these characteristics suggest that the outer arm gas is in a transitional state .",
    "this gas could be interacting with the ambient halo / disk gas of the milky way , and this interaction is causing the cloud to fragment and dissipate .",
    "it is particularly interesting that the and lines indicate low line widths .",
    "the line width of the component at @xmath117 km s@xmath14 indicatesvalue , @xmath177 .",
    "however , other factors ( e.g. , turbulence ) can contribute to the line broadening , so this temperature estimate should be treated as an upper limit . ]",
    "that the gas temperature @xmath178 k , and the in this component likewise indicates @xmath179 k. km s@xmath14 in both lines of the c  iv doublet . ]",
    "these upper limits are well below the temperatures where these species are expected to exist in collisional ionization equlibrium ( gnat & sternberg 2007 ) .",
    "interestingly , rather narrow and components are frequently identified in the highest resolultion stis echelle spectra probing interstellar clouds in and near the disk ( lehner et al .",
    "perhaps the gas is simply photoionized , but lehner et al .",
    "( 2011 ) argue that the narrow and weak and features do not arise in regions photoionized by nearby hot stars .",
    "it is interesting to note that hydrodynamic simulations of a cool gas cloud plunging through a hot halo can create this type of signature .",
    "for example , kwak & shelton ( 2010 ) have found that the turbulent mixing layers on the surface of such a cloud can contain a cool phase that is rich in as well as hotter phases that give rise to species such as . toward h1821 + 643 , sembach et al .",
    "( 2003 ) report strong at @xmath180 km s@xmath14 , with log @xmath4 ( ) = 13.87@xmath300.18 and @xmath181 ( ) @xmath82 22 km s@xmath14 .",
    "thus , this scenario of a cold cloud plunging through , and interacting with , an ambient medium seems to be consistent with many characteristics of the oa gas toward h1821 + 643 . in this situation",
    ", it is quite possible that the gas is not in ionization equilibrium but rather is in an overionized , relatively cool state .",
    "however , due to the strong blending of the components in the current stis data , the detailed parameters of individual components suffer from substantial uncertainties",
    ". it would be valuable to obtain new stis observations of h1821 + 643 with the e140h grating ( which provides substantially higher spectral resolution ) to better contrain the line widths / temperatures and kinematics of the gas .",
    "as we have summarized above , the extended gas cloud known as the outer arm is usually considered to be part of the warp in the outer galaxy and possibly the most distant spiral arm .",
    "however , the recent observations of lehner & howk ( 2010 ) have revealed aspects of the oa that are not expected in this scenario  the oa has a high - velocity component that is inconsistent with galactic rotation and instead indicates that the oa kinematics are similar to those of complex c , which is close to the oa in velocity and on the sky . we have presented additional observations that can be used to further probe the nature of the oa .",
    "briefly , we find :    1 .",
    "based on ultraviolet absorption lines , we have measured oa abundances in the directions of two qsos , h1821 + 643 and hs0624 + 6907 .",
    "the oa oxygen abundance in the direction of h1821 + 643 is [ o / h ] = @xmath169 .",
    "the metallicity derived from the hs0624 + 6907 sight line suggests that the oa could have a range of metallicities in different locations with @xmath182 , but the hs0624 + 6907 metallicity is more uncertain and is consistent with the h1821 + 643 metallicity when uncertainties are taken into account .",
    "the oa metallicity is only marginally higher than the abundances usually measured in complex c , @xmath183 ( e.g. , tripp et al .",
    "2003 ; collins et al . 2007 ;",
    "shull et al .",
    "both the oa and complex c are underabundant in nitrogen .",
    "this is often interpreted to be an indication that the gas is `` chemically young '' since nitrogen is synthesized in intermediate - mass stars , and thus more time is required to build up the nitrogen abundance than is required for species such as oxygen that are rapidly produced in type ii supernovae ( e.g. , vila costas & edmunds 1993 ; pettini et al .",
    "high - resolution spectroscopy of several stars in the direction of the oa indicates that the object is at a galactocentric radius of @xmath184 kpc .",
    "based on currently available constraints , it is possible that the oa and complex c are at similar distances .",
    "in addition , we have detected the hvc complex g , which is close to the outer arm , in absorption toward two stars .",
    "this places complex g relatively close to the solar galactocentric radius at @xmath185 = @xmath186 kpc .",
    "the oa absorption profiles toward h1821 + 643 show that the oa is a complex , multiphase entity with several narrow components , including narrow features in the profiles of highly ionized species .",
    "this suggests that the oa is , at least in part , interacting with the ambient gas of the milky way .",
    "this ensemble of information suggests that the outer arm might have a more complicated origin than the usual attribution to the outer warp .",
    "this concept has been proposed before : davies ( 1972 ) suggested a connection between the oa and complex c , which he proposed to be generated by the large magellanic cloud .",
    "more recently , kawata et al .",
    "( 2003 ) attempted to model the production of both of these structures by the interaction of a satellite galaxy with the milky way . while they found that structures similar to the oa + complex c could be generated",
    ", the absence of the interacting satellite ( which they require to have a mass comparable to the lmc ) in the expected part of the sky poses a problem for this model . at approximately the same time",
    ", the monoceros ring structure was discovered ( newberg et al .",
    "2002 ) , and given the similarity of the kinematics and location of the monoceros ring to the outer arm , it is interesting to ask if these high - velocity gas clouds could be related to the merging satellite that produced the stellar monoceros ring .",
    "we consider this hypothesis in a future paper .",
    "we thank martin weinberg and the anonymous referee for many helpful remarks that significantly improved this paper .",
