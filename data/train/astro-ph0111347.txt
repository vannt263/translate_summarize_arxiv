    "ngc 7252 is a nearby galaxy ( 63.2 mpc ) with tidal tails in the optical band .",
    "the tidal tails are thought to be the result of a galaxy merger of two spiral galaxies ( e.g. mihos , dubinski & hernquist 1998 ) .",
    "the merger phenomenon probably induced a violent starformation in the whole body ( e.g. hibbard et al .",
    "1994 , hereafter h94 ) .",
    "we can observe traces of the violent starformation which occurred less than 1 gyr ago ; for instance , the presence of an `` e+a '' spectrum ( schweitzer 1982 ) , the absence of h i gas in the inner region ( hibbard & van gorkom 1996 ) , and the existence of young globular clusters ( e.g. whitemore et al .",
    "1997 ) . in the central region ,",
    "its surface profile is well represented by the @xmath8 law which is seen in early - type galaxies ( e.g. schweizer 1982 , stanford & bushouse 1991 ) .",
    "numerical simulations predict that the tidal tails will disappear within a few gyr , and then this galaxy will be recognized as an early - type galaxy ( e.g. hibbard & mihos 1995 ) .",
    "therefore , this galaxy is also called `` a dynamically young protoelliptical ''",
    ".    early - type galaxies sometimes have powerful x - ray emission which originates from a hot gaseous halo surrounding the galaxies .",
    "their x - ray luminosities range from 10@xmath9 to 10@xmath10 ergs s@xmath2 ( e.g. forman , jones , & tucker 1985 ; canizares , fabbiano , & trinchieri 1987 ) .",
    "the total amount of the hot gaseous halo and the metal abundance are estimated to be 10@xmath1110@xmath12 and sub - solar , respectively ( e.g. awaki et al .",
    "1994 ; matsushita , ohashi , & makishima 2000 ) . in order to reveal the evolution of the hot gas ,",
    "many observational and theoretical works have been performed .",
    "since ngc 7252 is evolving into an early - type galaxy , this galaxy is one of the best objects for investigating the evolution of the hot gas surrounding early - type galaxies .",
    "detected x - rays from ngc 7252 with the _ rosat _ pspc and hri , and found that the x - ray emitting region is marginally extended , which indicates the existence of hot gas in ngc 7252 .",
    "however , they could not determine its accurate spectral shape . using the _ asca _ s wide - band spectroscopy",
    ", we reveal the nature of the hot gas in ngc 7252 .",
    "ngc 7252 was observed with _ asca _ on 1998",
    "november 1618 ( tanaka , inoue , & holt 1994 ) .",
    "since the intense shower of leonid meteors was expected to appear on november 17 , the high voltage of the gis was turned off in order to minimize the impact to the gis .",
    "therefore , the galaxy was observed with only the solid - state imaging spectrometer ( sis ) .",
    "the sis consists of two detectors , called sis0 and sis1 .",
    "the sis data were taken in the 1 ccd faint mode at all bit - rates .",
    "the data reduction was performed by the _ asca _",
    "guest observatory at nasa / gsfc using the following main criteria : ( 1 ) the angle from bright earth s limb @xmath13 , ( 2 ) the elevation angle from earth s limb @xmath14 , ( 3 ) the geometrical cut off rigidity @xmath15 gev c@xmath2 .",
    "the detail of the selection criteria is provided from the _ asca _ guest observatory .",
    "the on - source exposure time after the above screening is about 43.5 ks .",
    "we obtained an x - ray image in the 0.510 kev band with the data from sis0 and sis1 .",
    "figure 1 shows the x - ray contour map overlaid on the digitized sky survey map of ngc 7252 .",
    "we accumulated sis0 and sis1 data within a 6@xmath16 diameter circle centered on the x - ray source ; a background spectrum is taken from a non - source region @xmath17 in diameter .",
    "we combine energy bins to contain more than 50 counts in each bin and apply a @xmath18 method in the xspec 11.00 package for spectral fitting . the spectrum after background subtraction is shown in figure 2 .",
    "we first attempted to fit a single - component model , a thermal model or a power law model , to the spectrum .",
    "however , the spectrum was characterized with @xmath192.3 kev or @xmath202.3 with @xmath21 .",
    "next , we introduced a two - component model , thin thermal plus thermal bremsstrahlung model .",
    "this model provided an acceptable fit to the data ( @xmath22 ) , with the absorption column fixed at the galactic value of 2@xmath23 @xmath3 ( stark et al .",
    "1990 ) . since the confidence region of the metal abundance @xmath24 was too large , we fixed @xmath24 at one solar metal abundance ( table 1 ) .",
    "the thin thermal and the thermal bremsstrahlung models are characterized with @xmath50.13 kev and @xmath6 kev , respectively .",
    "the best - fit model is shown in figure 2 . using this model ,",
    "the x - ray flux is ( 1.8@xmath00.3)@xmath1 ergs s@xmath2 @xmath3 in the 0.510 kev band , which corresponds to the x - ray luminosity of 8.1@xmath4 ergs s@xmath2 assuming the distance of 63.2 mpc .",
    "the x - ray flux in the _ rosat _ band ( 0.24 kev ) is about 1.0@xmath1 ergs s@xmath2 @xmath3 , which is consistent with that obtained by h94 , although they did not determine the spectral shape of the x - rays from ngc 7252 , and , hence assumed a thin thermal emission with @xmath25 kev and metal abundance of 1 solar .",
    "the _ rosat _ observation by h94 found a soft x - ray emission which is marginally extended , which indicates the existence of the hot gas in ngc 7252 .",
    "our _ asca _ observation finds that the soft x - ray emission has the characteristic temperature of @xmath50.13 kev , and the observed x - ray flux in the 0.54 kev band is about 4@xmath26 ergs s@xmath2 @xmath3 , which corresponds to the x - ray luminosity of the 2@xmath4 ergs s@xmath2 after the correction of the galactic absorption .",
    "as compared with x - ray properties of early type galaxies , the soft x - ray luminosity of ngc 7252 is low for an early - type galaxy .",
    "our result is consistent with a claim by fabbiano & schweizer ( 1995 ) , who pointed out that ngc 7252 belongs to group 1 in the @xmath27 diagram of e and s0 galaxies ( see figure 7 in their paper ) . in group 1 ,",
    "the contribution of the soft component to the total x - ray emission is considered to be small ( e.g. fabbiano & schweizer 1995 , matsumoto et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "ngc 7252 is a post - starburst galaxy as well as a dynamically young protoelliptical ( e.g. schweizer 1982 , stanford & bushouse 1991 ) .",
    "both types of galaxies sometimes have hot gas surrounding the galaxy .",
    "we took the luminosity ratio of @xmath7 to find a possible origin of the hot gas in the galaxy .",
    "figure 3 shows the correlation plot of the x - ray luminosities in the 0.54 kev band and the far - infrared luminosities .",
    "the region between two solid lines in figure 3 indicates the luminosity ratio of about 10@xmath28 which most starburst / h ii galaxies have ( david , jones , & forman ( 1992 ) ) .",
    "the open circles in figure 3 show the data for early - type galaxies .",
    "their x - ray data are taken from canizares et al .",
    "( 1987 ) , and their infrared data are deduced from iras 60 and 100 @xmath29 fluxes ( taken from knapp et al .",
    "( 1989 ) ) using the usual `` bolometric '' far - infrared brightness ( e.g. devereux & eales 1989 ) @xmath30 where the 60 and 100 @xmath29 flux densities are expressed in mjy . the far - infrared light from early - type galaxies is emitted from cool interstellar matter , and thus their luminosities are smaller than those of starburst galaxies ( knapp et al .",
    "1989 ; bregman et al .",
    "therefore , early - type galaxies lie in the upper left side in the figure .",
    "ngc 7252 is a luminous far - infrared object with @xmath31 ( dupraz et al .",
    "we find that the luminosity ratio of @xmath7 of ngc 7252 is about 10@xmath28 , and find that the position of a closed circle in figure 3 presenting ngc 7252 is within the region of starburst galaxies .",
    "the luminosity ratio suggests that the soft x - ray emission is associated with the starburst activity .",
    "note that the x - ray luminosity of ngc 7252 includes x - ray emissions from both soft ( @xmath32 ) and hard ( @xmath33 ) components , because canizares et al .",
    "( 1987 ) and david et al .",
    "( 1992 ) did not distinguish soft and hard components when they estimated the x - ray luminosities .    in order to estimate the total amount of the hot gas and the total energy",
    ", we obtained the volume emission measure , @xmath34 , of @xmath35 @xmath36 from the spectral fit of the x - ray spectrum with solar abundance ( @xmath24 = 1.0 ) .",
    "this emission measure is the lowest compared to the sample of early - type galaxies by matsumoto et al .",
    "we note that the sample by matsumoto et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have a mean abundance of 0.3 , and that the volume emission measure of a thin thermal plasma is a strong function of the metal abundance .",
    "we obtained the emission measure @xmath37 @xmath36 in @xmath24=0.3 , and confirmed that the emission measure is still low among their sample .",
    "read & ponman ( 1998 ) found that the _ rosat _ pspc source appeared centrally concentrated and compact , though a couple of tentative extended features were seen .",
    "the x - ray image by the _ rosat _ observation is consistent with the h@xmath38 image reported by h94 . in starburst galaxies , the x - ray emitting region",
    "is well correlated with the h@xmath38 emitting region ( for example , ngc 1808 ( dahlem , hartner , & junkes 1994 ) ) .",
    "therefore , we assumed that the hot gas fills the inner region of @xmath39=2 kpc with a filling factor @xmath40 , where @xmath39 is a radius of the hot plasma , because h94 pointed out that about 90 % of the h@xmath38 line emission is in @xmath41 ( @xmath42 2.5 kpc at d = 63.2 mpc ) .",
    "we obtain the mean electron number density to be @xmath43 @xmath36 .",
    "the total mass and the total energy are estimated to be 2@xmath44 and 7@xmath45 ergs , respectively .",
    "they indicate that in starburst activity , ngc 7252 can stand comparison with nearby active starburst galaxies ( e.g. m82 and ngc 253 ( fabbiano 1988 ) ) .",
    "ciotti et al .",
    "( 1991 ) classified the early - type galaxies into three evolutionary stages : wind , outflow , and inflow phases . since it is thought that the intense star formation occurred within the last 1 gyr ( schweitzer 1982 ;",
    "hibbard & van gorkom 1996 ) and numerical simulations have suggested that ngc 7252 evolves to an early - type galaxy , we consider that ngc 7252 belongs to the wind phase , in which the thermalized gas due to collisions between stellar winds and/or between winds and ambient gas is ejected from the galaxy .",
    "the low x - ray luminosity of ngc 7252 can be explained by the gas ejection from the galaxy .",
    "based on the evolutional model by ciotti et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , within a few gyr , ngc 7252 will change to outflow phase , and then ngc 7252 will be surrounded by a large amount of hot gas .",
    "read & ponman ( 1998 ) suggested the existence of hard x - ray sources in ngc 7252 , since the fitted absorbing column appears larger than the galactic value .",
    "the _ asca _",
    "s wide - band spectroscopy resolved the hard x - ray emission with the x - ray luminosity of about 5.6@xmath4 ergs s@xmath2 in the 210 kev band .",
    "the spectrum is characterized by the thermal model with @xmath6 kev or the power law model with photon index of 1.2 .",
    "the _ rosat _ hri found two bright x - ray sources ( read & ponman 1998 ) .",
    "one is located within 7@xmath46 from the center of ngc 7252 , and its x - ray luminosity is estimated to be 3@xmath4 ergs s@xmath2 assuming the thermal emission with @xmath47 kev .",
    "the other is located in the eastern extension seen in the pspc , and its x - ray luminosity is estimated to be 1.6@xmath4 ergs s@xmath2 . _ asca _ can not separate these two sources due to its poor spatial resolution . since the x - ray luminosity observed by _",
    "is nearly equal to the sum of the x - ray luminosities of the two sources , we consider that most of the hard x - ray emission come from these two sources . from the brightness of these two sources in the _ rosat _ hri band , the significant fraction of the hard x - rays detected with _ asca _",
    "is probably emitted from the former bright hri source .",
    "our result indicates the existence of a hard x - ray source with @xmath48 erg s@xmath2 in the central region .",
    "the hard x - ray source may be a low - luminosity agn or an intermediate - mass black hole ( 10@xmath49 ) ( colbert & mushotzky 1999 ; matsumoto et al .",
    "2001 ; kaaret et al .",
    "we analyzed _ asca _ data for a merging galaxy ngc 7252 .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is well described by a two - component model , soft plus hard components .",
    "the soft component is characterized by a thin thermal plasma model with @xmath190.73kev . from the @xmath7 , the thin thermal emission probably originates from the hot gas due to star formation . assuming the size of hot gas of 2 kpc , the total amount of hot gas is estimated to be 2@xmath50 , which indicate that ngc 7252 still have large starburst activity comparable to those of nearby active starburst galaxies .",
    "numerical simulations and observational results suggest that this galaxy is in the post - starburst phase .",
    "therefore , we can explain the low x - ray luminosity of ngc 7252 due to ejection of hot gas from the galaxy .",
