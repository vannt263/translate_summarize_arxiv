    "other plausible pumping scenarios include local shocks produced by random motions of clumps or turbulence , supported by the presence of strong h@xmath5 ( 1 - 0 ) @xmath6 emission @xcite , or by infrared ( ir ) pumping similar to conditions observed in star forming regions @xcite .",

    "such short timescales are not considered in our study since in data averaged over a minute only a couple of masers would be bright enough to be reliably detected .    assuming that the variability of the maser intensity is not due to observational effects , variability studies can be used to probe the maser environment .",

    "water masers associated with sfrs are excited behind shocks , presumably caused by outflows or jets driven by the young stellar object ( yso ) , and much of the variation can be attributed to changes in the luminosity of the yso , in turn affecting the pumping rate via changes in the outflows and jets @xcite .",
    "oh masers associated with sfrs are predominantly observed in the radiatively pumped 1665 and 1667 mhz lines ( sometimes accompanied by masers in the 1612 and 1720mhz transitions ) , and variability of those masers have been investigated by multiple groups @xcite .",
    "the long term variability ( weeks to months ) can be attributed to changes in the number density of inverted oh molecules , or path length changes .",

    "no dedicated variability studies of 1720  mhz oh masers have been published to date , and we therefore know little about the stability of the maser environment in these sources . here",
    "we have a shocked environment and since this is a large scale phenomena it must arise in the maser generating column density , or from the subsequent propagation of emission through the interstellar medium .",
    "the northeastern snr masers clearly are variable on the timescales of weeks to months .",
    "these masers are the result of the snr sgraeast ramming into the @xmath0  ^-1 kms@xmath1  cloud and we expect the post - shock medium to display density variations due to turbulence in those regions , given that a shock has recently passed . assuming that the masers can be considered as a series of velocity coherent regions of gas , bulk gas flow and turbulent motion in the source will move parts of the maser column in and out of velocity coherence along the line of sight . as a result",
    ", the maser will exhibit intensity variations .",
    "for the northeastern masers this can not be the only source of the variability though , since much higher levels of variability are observed than toward other regions of sgraeast .",
    "it is not clear whether it is the maser generating column density itself or the medium in front of the masers that is causing the variability .",
    "however , the @xmath0  ^-1 kms@xmath1  cloud is thought to be located behind sgraeast ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* paperi ) and thus between the observer and the masers .",
    "when observing this group of masers we therefore probably look through a longer path length of turbulent gas than toward other regions of sgraeast .",
    "this is supported by oh absorption observations showing this region harbors a much higher absorbing oh column density than the southern and northwestern interaction regions ( paperi , karlsson et al .",
    "it is possible that the supernova covering the northeastern region contributes to the turbulence of this column density .",
    "in contrast , the southern masers are occurring in a region where the two snr sgraeast and g359.02@xmath100.09 are colliding . here",
    "there is no clear evidence of large columns of gas in front of the masers , and no supernova crossing the line of sight .",
    "the cnd masers exhibit much less variability than the northeastern snr masers , with no maser displaying variability with a @xmath14 .",
    "if the northeastern snr / ism maser variability is due to passage of the maser through a screen of hot turbulent gas , the ( non-)variability of the cnd masers is consistent with cnd located _ in front of _ sgraeast ( paperi ) .",
    "since variability could give insight into the maser environment , we consider whether the low variability is consistent with the presumed pumping and amplification conditions in the cnd . here",
    "the pumping can not be due to a snr / ism shock , but the cnd masers are thought to be pumped by collisions between clumps in the cnd ( paperi ) . the number of clumps within the line of sight are probably only a few since once a clump has moved out of the line of sight , a maser is likely to disappear completely . assuming an inclination of 65@xmath29 @xcite and thus a rotational velocity of approximately 160  ^-1 kms@xmath1  of the maser emitting clouds in the cnd , the motion in the plane of the sky over the 195 days is minimal ; only @xmath30 pc ( approximately 8 au ) .",
    "this is much smaller than the high density cloud core sizes of @xmath31 pc that are estimated by molecular line observations @xcite .",
    "similarly , assuming typical relative clump velocities of 20 - 30  ^-1",
    "kms@xmath1  in the sky - plane and 0.1  pc in size , a clump will pass by a compact maser in @xmath323900 years . for a clump size of 1  au",
    "the corresponding time is 2 months .",
    "if clump collisions and motions are involved in determining the path lengths for the cnd masers , given the low variability levels observed the clumps must be much larger than 1  au in size .",
    "more likely they are only a fraction of the size of the dense molecular clumps observed in hcn , perhaps corresponding to a high density region of the clump . for such clump sizes little variability",
    "can be expected due to path length changes .",
    "a factor that could contribute to a more stable maser gain in the cnd region is the pumping conditions .",
    "as measured in molecular line emission , hcn and hco@xmath33 line intensity is stronger in the cnd than in regions associated with , for example , the @xmath0  ^-1 kms@xmath1  cloud @xcite , implying higher densities .",
    "a higher density would result in a higher collision rate , thus keeping the pumping at a higher rate eventually resulting in more stable maser intensities .",
    "note that @xcite show that densities @xmath34 @xmath35 are needed for clump - clump collisions to produce 1720mhz pumping , which is slightly higher than the c - shock post - region density of @xmath36 @xmath35 for the snr masers @xcite .    what the exact pumping conditions and the pumping rate really are is difficult to calculate , and depends on the ortho - para @xmath37 ratio in the region .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite have found that collisions with para - h@xmath5 can strongly suppress the 1720 mhz inversion .",
    "ortho- and para - h@xmath5 are thought to be formed on grains with a ratio of 3:1 . at low temperatures ( @xmath38 k ) proton exchange reaction convert ortho - h@xmath5 into para - h@xmath5 , making the para - h@xmath5 being the dominant species . as the temperature increases",
    ", there is less of a difference , but still with para - h@xmath5 dominating @xcite .",
    "however , to create the 1720  mhz maser only a small amount of ortho - h@xmath5 is required , since the collision rate for ortho - h@xmath5 usually is larger by a factor of 2 - 3 than the para rates @xcite . the equilibrium ratio for ortho - para h@xmath5 is @xmath39 , which is equal to 1 for a temperature @xmath40k , implying the temperature should be cooler than this value .",
    "this is consistent with a high density environment in the cnd where the gas temperature is thermalized with the dust temperatures of 20 - 80k @xcite , although molecular studies of the cnd imply excitation temperatures anywhere between 50 - 200k @xcite .",
    "@xcite use nh@xmath41(2,2)/nh@xmath41)(1,1 ) ratios to derive rotational gas temperatures between 20 - 70  k , mostly in the outer regions of the cnd .",
    "perhaps , next to path - length geometry ( paperi ) , this is a reason that 1720 mhz masers are not seen all across the cnd ; if temperatures are too high the 1720 mhz emission will be suppressed .",
    "we have presented the first flux monitoring study of 1720  mhz oh masers associated with an snr . in total five epochs of the 1720  mhz oh masers in the gc were obtained , and used to estimate the maser flux in different regions of the gc .",
    "we find that the typical variability is very low , but that the northeastern snr / ism masers have a higher variability than the other masers .",
    "we speculate this is because the @xmath0  ^-1 kms@xmath1 cloud is located behind the snr , and the maser emission travels through a longer path length of turbulent gas before reaching the observer . at other locations across the snr",
    "the masers probably arise at the near side of the snr with less material between the maser and the observer , and therefore show a much lower level of variability .",
    "similarly low variability levels are found for the cnd masers consistent with the cnd being located in front of sgraeast .",
    "the low variability of the cnd maser agrees with a scenario where the pumping is provided by relatively large clumps ( sizes @xmath42 au ) ."
