    "the model takes into account two - particle correlations by means of a simple screened coulomb potential with no empirical parameter . in his work overhauser",
    "finds an approximate solution for the dependence of @xmath1 on the electron density .",

    "this coefficient is important for new energy density functionals which include the gradient correction to the @xmath3 coefficient of the exchange - correlation hole , while its spin resolution ( i.e. , its @xmath17 and @xmath18 contributions , also available in the present treatment ) is of interest for functionals based on the fermi hole curvature.@xcite",
    "other possible applications are discussed at the end of this article .",
    "the overhauser model is fully quantum mechanical , and incorporates the effect of exchange on the pair - distribution function in the zero - temperature electron gas . an interesting alternative approach@xcite mimics these effects by using a classical pair - distribution function with a non - zero effective temperature .",
    "following overhauser,@xcite we will construct the pair distribution function from two - electron wavefunctions .",
    "the rigorous analogs of these wavefunctions are perhaps the `` natural geminals '' that diagonalize the two - electron density matrix;@xcite the diagonal of this matrix is the pair density . for a generalization of the hartree - fock approximation from orbitals to geminals ,",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "if we select a pair of electrons at random in the spin - unpolarized uniform gas , there is one chance in four that they will be in the singlet state , @xmath19 , and three chances in four that they will be in one of the triplet states , @xmath17 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 . in the case of no electron - electron interaction ,",
    "the corresponding two - electron spatial wavefunctions will be @xmath22 where `` @xmath23''is for the singlet state and `` @xmath24 '' is for the triplet state , and @xmath25 we can expand the plane waves into spherical harmonics @xmath26 where @xmath27 are legendre polynomials and @xmath28 are spherical bessel functions .",
    "then we will have @xmath29 we can define spin - resolved pair - distribution functions for the uniform electron gas , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , corresponding to parallel- and antiparallel - spin interactions , and such that for the unpolarized gas @xmath32 they can be related to the formulas just derived by simple considerations : ( i ) if we select at random a pair of electrons in the uniform gas , there is a probability @xmath33 that they have relative momentum @xmath34 , ( ii ) the probability for the singlet state is @xmath35 and the probability for the triplet state is @xmath36 , ( iii ) @xmath37 of the triplet state contributes to the antiparallel - spin correlations and @xmath38 of it to the parallel - spin correlations .",
    "so , we simply have @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes average over @xmath33 and over the solid angle . performing the spherical average over the solid angle ,",
    "we obtain : @xmath41 eq .",

    ", we can now proceed to compute an interacting pair - distribution function by introducing a suitable electron - electron potential which describes the interactions in a uniform electron gas .",

    "overhauser  @xcite proposed a simple and reasonable model for the screened coulomb repulsion @xmath57 in the uniform electron gas . in the standard uniform - electron - gas model ,",

    "thus , for interelectronic distances @xmath2 we expect the overhauser potential to be close to the true potential felt by an electron moving in a uniform electron gas when another electron is fixed at the origin . in the region @xmath64 the potential is set to zero , and so is not expected to be reliable .",
    "we also expect to have results that become more accurate as the density decreases , since the probability of having three electrons in the same sphere of radius @xmath6 becomes lower and lower",
    ". finally , at high and intermediate densities our results will be much closer to the true @xmath0 for antiparallel - spin correlations than for parallel - spin ones .",
    "when two electrons of opposite spins are in the same sphere of radius @xmath6 , a third electron is excluded from the sphere because of both the pauli principle and the coulomb repulsion . for a pair of parallel - spin electrons ,",
