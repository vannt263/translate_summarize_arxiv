    "<S> we examine the interference @xmath0 box corrections to parity - violating elastic electron  proton scattering in the light of the recent observation of quark - hadron duality in parity - violating deep - inelastic scattering from the deuteron , and the approximate isospin independence of duality in the electromagnetic nucleon structure functions down to @xmath1  gev@xmath2 . assuming that a similar behavior also holds for the @xmath0 proton structure functions </S>",
    "<S> , we find that duality constrains the @xmath0 box correction to the proton s weak charge to be @xmath3 at the kinematics of the experiment . within the same model we also provide estimates of the @xmath0 corrections for future parity - violating experiments , such as moller at jefferson lab and mesa at mainz .    </S>",
