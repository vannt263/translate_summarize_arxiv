    "we address a question raised recently by combescot and roulet@xcite ( cr ) in the context of the nonequilibrium x - ray edge problem . the latter was studied some years ago by ng@xcite who developed an extension of the well - known nozires and de  dominicis@xcite ( nd ) technique . in the late 60s ,",
    "nd devised this method for the computation of the x - ray absorption spectrum .",
    "they provided with it an elegant description of the shape of the edge singularity in terms of the scattering phase shift at the fermi surface .",
    "the approach is based on some subtle approximations , though , and thorough check of the condition of validity is required .",
    "such a check is provided , for instance , by comparison with the perturbative parquet diagram result of roulet , gavoret and nozires@xcite , and the validity of nd s solution for the original x - ray problem can in this sense be proven . for the nonequilibrium case , however , cr revealed an inconsistency by comparing a similar parquet diagram summation to ng s result , yet they did not provide an explanation of its origin . in the present paper , we show that the discrepancies arise from an uncritical use of the decoupling of the momenta of the scattering potential .",
    "further , we show how nd s method can be modified to yield a result coinciding with the perturbative one .",
    "this is illustrated on cr s academic problem for which it turns out that ng s multi - channel extensions are not required .",
    "the nonequilibrium system to be discussed consists of two fermi seas @xmath0 , referred to as _",
    "subbands _ which are characterized by the fixed chemical potentials @xmath1 and the energies @xmath2 at the bottom of the subbands .",
    "we assume that @xmath3 , so there is a nonzero overlap between the bottom of the subband 2 and the fermi surface @xmath4 .",
    "a core state with energy @xmath5 and an infinite mass is assumed to exist below the subbands .",
    "the qualitative situation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : system ] .    if both subbands were isolated , the x - ray absorption spectrum would be the result of a simple superposition of two independent x - ray problems , and two edge singularities corresponding to @xmath4 and @xmath6 could be observed .",
    "the mixture between the two subbands , however , allows for a new physical process : particle - hole excitations with the particle in one subband and the hole in the other one become possible with energies that may be positive or negative ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : system ] ) .",
    "the form of the absorption spectrum is changed considerably .",
    "the edge singularities are broadened , the core - hole acquires a finite life - time , and absorption below the threshold becomes possible , where the missing energy is compensated by such particle - hole excitations of negative energy .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is assumed to be given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 labels the subbands .",
    "conduction electrons with momenta @xmath9 in the subbands @xmath10 are created and annihilated by @xmath11 and @xmath12 , while @xmath13 and @xmath14 operate on the core state .",
    "the interaction with the photon field is described by the operator @xmath15 for simplicity , spin indices have been dropped .",
    "the problem , as it is defined by the hamiltonians and above , depends on the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 . with respect to the original x - ray problem",
    "the new physics must enter with the subband couplings @xmath17 . to focus on the new effects we consider with cr the academic problem of @xmath18 .",
    "this means that a photon can excite the core electron only into the subband @xmath19 , and particle - hole excitations are due only to particles tunneling between both subbands , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : system ] .    the perturbative approach of cr consists in assuming @xmath20 and in expanding the response function @xmath21 , which is the fourier transform of @xmath22 in powers of @xmath23 the imaginary part of @xmath21 yields the absorption rate @xmath24 .",
    "cr performed the sum over the most singular parquet diagrams and found an absorption rate of the x - ray problem which is , close to the threshold energy @xmath25 , of the form @xmath26 for @xmath27 a cutoff of the order of the band width , @xmath28 the usual step function , and @xmath29 the effective coupling constant @xmath30 here we have used the notation @xmath31 for the density of states in the subband @xmath10 at the energy @xmath32 , and @xmath33 for the integral @xmath34 with @xmath35 denoting the principal value .",
    "the approximation holds for small values of the coupling constant @xmath29 .",
    "cr compared this result with ng s extended nd approach .",
    "their criticism refers to the appearance of the density of states @xmath36 , and not , as in the perturbative result above , of the density of states at @xmath4 , @xmath37 .",
    "the presence of @xmath38 implies a coupling of particles at the respective energies @xmath4 and @xmath6 , whereas the zero energy inter - subband fluctuations at @xmath4 are entirely absent .",
    "this is definitely unphysical as soon as @xmath39 becomes large .",
    "the origin of this discrepancy remained unresolved in cr s paper and is discussed in the next section .",
    "the problems with nd s approach arise from an uncritical use of the momentum decoupling @xmath40 as cr have noticed with the perturbative results above , the important particle - hole excitations occur in the low energy sector with the particle and hole energies close to the fermi surface @xmath4 . in the single - band equilibrium x - ray problem ,",
    "the restriction to this energy sector can be assured by the decoupling . as it turns out , the explicit form of the @xmath41 is of little importance because the form of the free propagator is controlled by the discontinuity at the fermi surface ( see ref .  , eq . and below ) which naturally imposes the low - energy restrictions .",
    "there is consequently no risk in assuming the potential @xmath42 to be constant in the whole band as long as one introduces the adequate cutoff @xmath27 imposed by the band width .    in the nonequilibrium case",
    "a similar `` naive '' splitting of the form leads to the unphysical results mentioned above .",
    "if one assumes the potential to be constant over the whole band widths , the free propagators which are integrated over the @xmath43 are controlled by the discontinuities at the fermi surfaces of their respective subbands analogously to the original x - ray problem .",
    "the coupling of the subbands then leads to the mixture of the energy sectors close to the different fermi surfaces , and therefore to large energy particle - hole excitations of the order of @xmath39 , whereas the inter - subband fluctuations close to @xmath4 and @xmath6 respectively are absent . from cr s perturbative",
    "approach , however , we know that the latter are the relevant processes and can not be neglected .    in the sequel",
    "we propose a projection onto these low - energy sectors which is artificial in a similar way as nd s splitting in the one - band case but allows us to capture the important particle - hole excitations found within the perturbative approach .",
    "let us reconsider the academic problem above in which only the potentials @xmath44^*$ ] are non - zero . to restrict to energies close to @xmath4 we assume these potentials to be separable as @xmath45 where the @xmath46 are functions which refer to values of @xmath9 in the subband @xmath10 and which are maximum at the fermi surface @xmath32 and fall off sufficiently fast away from it . to maintain the hermiticity of the potentials @xmath47 we assume these functions to be real and equal , @xmath48 .",
    "in nd s approach , the constant part @xmath47 acts as an `` external '' potential on particles described by the operators @xmath49 during times between @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the relevant physical quantities can be obtained from the so - called transient propagator , @xmath52 , which describes the time evolution of these particles , with @xmath53 .",
    "the potential @xmath47 enters as the self - energy part into the dyson equation for the transient propagator ( see eq .   below ) .",
    "the free part of this dyson equation is described by the green s functions @xmath54.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] following nd we must examine the asymptotic behavior of these functions as @xmath55 .",
    "we first consider the case @xmath56 . here",
    "the cutoff function @xmath57 is centered at the fermi surface @xmath4 which corresponds to the situation of the original x - ray problem .",
    "let us recall nd s arguments to obtain an approximate expression for @xmath58 : for large times @xmath59 the behavior of @xmath58 is dominated by the discontinuity at the fermi surface .",
    "let @xmath60 with @xmath61 the density of states in the subband 1 , and @xmath62 .",
    "then , for @xmath63 @xmath64 which becomes for large times @xmath65 ( where @xmath27 is the characteristic energy describing the decay of @xmath66 ) , @xmath67 the same expression holds for @xmath68 .",
    "we observe that the exact shape of @xmath66 is of no importance as long as @xmath69 . to include the short - time behavior , @xmath70 , nd imposed that integrals over the product of @xmath58 and some slowly varying function ( the transient propagator ) must yield the correct result .",
    "hence , if @xmath71 is a time cutoff such that @xmath72 but still much smaller than the characteristic time scale of the transient propagator , the short - time behavior of @xmath58 enters only through the integral @xmath73 where we have used eq .   for the second equality .",
    "this quantity can be added to the asymptotic expression in the form of @xmath74 , and we obtain the central approximation of nd s approach @xmath75    the case @xmath76 is more subtle because there is no fermi edge discontinuity at @xmath4 for electrons in the subband @xmath77 .",
    "let us set @xmath78 with @xmath79 the density of states in the subband 2 .",
    "we have , from eq .",
    ", @xmath80 if @xmath39 is large with respect to the decay of the function @xmath66 the first integral can be neglected .",
    "using the same argument , we can push the upper boundary of the remaining integral to infinity .",
    "hence @xmath81 for large times , @xmath82 , the period of oscillation of the exponential is much shorter than the time of variation of the @xmath83 so that the integral averages to zero . following the above argumentation",
    ", the short - time behavior of @xmath84 can be resumed into a term @xmath85 with ( using eq .  )",
    "@xmath86 the exchange of the two integrals demands some care because the integrand becomes singular . for nonzero values of @xmath87",
    "the time integration can be performed first and yields an integrand proportional to @xmath88 . in order to handle @xmath89",
    ", we notice that only the advanced part of the function survives because of the constraint @xmath68 .",
    "this implies that the energies entering in the exponential of eq .   must be shifted by an infinitesimal imaginary amount , @xmath90 , with @xmath91 .",
    "the time integration can then be performed first , and we obtain @xmath92 where we have neglected the term at the lower boundary of the time integral since it is due to the sharp artificial time - cutoff @xmath71 . with the formula @xmath93 we finally find @xmath94 with @xmath95 which coincides with @xmath96 , given by eq .   with a slightly modified definition because of the weight function @xmath97 .",
    "the approximate form resulting from nd s argumentation is therefore given by @xmath98 \\ , \\delta(t).\\ ] ] there is no algebraic decay in @xmath99 because the fermi surface discontinuity for the subband @xmath100 is of no relevance for processes of energies close to @xmath101 .      with the approximate forms of the initial green s functions , eqs .   and",
    ", we can follow nd s analysis step by step , and we focus here only on the new features in the derivation .    the computation of physical quantities is based on the transient propagators @xmath102 which can be defined by the dyson equations @xmath103 for the academic problem under discussion , the functions @xmath104 and @xmath105 are found to form a closed set of equations , @xmath106 since @xmath84 is proportional to a @xmath107-function , we obtain a single integral equation for @xmath104 , @xmath108 in which the effective interaction @xmath109 ( -v^{21})\\ ] ] leads to the same coupling constant @xmath29 as in the perturbative approach , given by eq .  .",
    "the remaining problem coincides exactly with nd s original x - ray problem with the interaction potential @xmath110 replaced by the effective potential @xmath111 .",
    "therefore , the absorption rate becomes , from eq .   of ref .  , @xmath112,\\ ] ] with @xmath113 and",
    "@xmath107 the complex `` phase shift '' at @xmath101 induced by the effective potential @xmath111 , @xmath114 for small @xmath47 , one has @xmath115 , and the absorption rate merges with the parquet graph result of cr .",
    "furthermore , the imaginary part of @xmath107 leads to a broadening of the sharp fermi edge singularities which exists in the case of disconnected subbands .",
    "with the preceding discussion of the nonequilibrium x - ray problem we have seen that nd s technique provides an elegant calculation tool for which , however , the conditions of validity must be checked carefully at the beginning .",
    "the key approximation is the restriction to low - energy fluctuations close to the fermi surface(s ) .",
    "the separation of momenta in the interaction potentials must occur in these energy sectors . in the single - band case of the original x - ray problem ,",
    "this low - energy restriction enters naturally by the discontinuity of the green s functions at the fermi surface which controls the large time behavior of these functions .",
    "the particular form of the weight functions @xmath116 which project onto the low - energy sector has only little importance , so that it even might be taken as constant over the whole band , as often assumed in the literature .",
    "we have noticed with cr that the latter assumption leads to unphysical results within nd s approach in the case of nonequilibrium systems . here",
    "the form of the weight functions becomes important , and we have shown how the approximations of the initial green s functions must be chosen to obtain physical results .",
    "in particular , the decay in @xmath99 which is characteristic for nd s asymptotic approximation , appears only if a fermi surface lies within the energy range in which the cutoff functions @xmath116 are non - zero .    with this taken into account",
    ", nd s method remains valid and provides us with quantitative results for the exponents of the power - law divergences at the fermi edges .",
    "moreover , the absence of the @xmath99-decay in the subband @xmath76 reduces the complexity of the discussed multi - channel problem . instead of systems of singular integral equations",
    ", we deal with a scalar ( single - channel ) problem in which the presence of the other channels is reflected by a mere renormalization of the interaction strength which , however , becomes a complex quantity ."
