    "the role of the spinor field in the evolution of the universe has been studied by a number of authors @xcite . a principal goal of those studies was to find out singularity - free solutions to the corresponding field equations .",
    "the gravitational field in these cases was given by an anisotropic bianchi type - i ( bi ) cosmological model .",
    "it has been found that the introduction of the nonlinear spinor field in some special cases results in a rapid growth of the universe . in light of that study",
    "many authors believe it is possible to consider the spinor field as one of the candidates to explain the late time accelerated mode of expansion @xcite .    though as an anisotropic cosmological model cosmologists basically consider bianchi type - i space - time , there are still a few other models that describe an anisotropic space - time and generate particular interest among physicists   @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite methods of dynamical systems analysis were used to show that the presence of a magnetic field orthogonal to the two commuting killing vector fields in any spatially homogeneous bianchi type @xmath1 vacuum solution to einstein s equation changes the evolution towards the singularity from collapse to bounce .",
    "the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite studied the problem of isotropization of scalar field bianchi models with an exponential potential(s ) .",
    "other papers mentioned above are devoted to tilted perfect fluid solutions , chaotic singularities , and conditional symmetries .    in a recent paper",
    "@xcite we studied the self - consistent system of the nonlinear spinor field and an anisotropic inhomogeneous gravitational field in order to clarify the role of the spinor field nonlinearity and the space - time inhomogeneity in the formation of a singularity - free universe .",
    "as an anisotropic space - time we chose a bianchi type - vi ( bvi ) model , since a suitable choice of its parameters yields a few other bianchi models including bi and frw universes . it can be noted that unlike the bi universe , the bvi space - time is inhomogeneous .",
    "inclusion of inhomogeneity in the gravitational field significantly complicates the search for an exact solution to the system .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study a self consistent system of spinor , scalar and bianchi type - vi gravitational fields in presence of a perfect fluid and a cosmological constant and study the role of corresponding material fields in the evolution of the universe .",
    "we shall investigate a self - consistent system of nonlinear spinor and einstein gravitational fields .",
    "these two fields are to be determined by the following action : @xmath2 with @xmath3 the gravitational part of the lagrangian @xmath4 is given by a bianchi type - vi ( bvi hereafter ) space - time , whereas the terms @xmath5 , and @xmath6 describe the spinor and scalar field lagrangian and an interaction between them , respectively .",

    "the contribution of the perfect fluid to the system is performed by means of its energy - momentum tensor , which acts as one of the sources of the corresponding gravitational field equations .",

    "the gravitational field in our case is given by a bvi metric : @xmath29 with @xmath30 being functions of time only .",
    "here @xmath31 are some arbitrary constants and the velocity of light is taken to be unity .",
    "it should be emphasized that the bvi metric models a universe that is anisotropic and inhomogeneous . a suitable choice of @xmath31 as well as the metric functions @xmath30 in the bvi metric given by generates the following bianchi - type universes : ( i ) for @xmath32 the bvi metric transforms into a bianchi - type v ( bv ) universe ; ( ii ) for @xmath33 the bvi metric transforms into a bianchi - type iii ( biii ) universe ; ( iii ) for @xmath34 the bvi metric transforms into a bianchi - type i ( bi ) universe and finally , ( iv ) for @xmath35 and an equal scale factor in all three directions the bvi metric transforms into a frw universe .",
