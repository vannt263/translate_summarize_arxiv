    "heavy fermion compounds play a central role in strongly correlated electron systems , and their physical properties have been studied extensively over the past three decades.@xcite the exotic low temperature phenomena involved in this kind of system are associated with an entropy transfer from local moment degrees of freedom to the conduction electrons ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "a defining feature of the heavy fermion compounds is a largely enhanced sommerfeld coefficient @xmath6 , as exemplified historically by cecu@xmath0si@xmath0 which exhibits @xmath7  mj / mol.k@xmath2 , implying a renormalized effective mass of @xmath8 @xmath9 10@xmath2  @xmath10,@xcite where @xmath10 is the free electron mass .",
    "the level of degeneracy of the electronic levels near the fermi surface in the involved rare - earth ions also plays a fundamental role in the hybridized @xmath11 properties.@xcite    rare - earth heavy fermion systems@xcite are customarily accompanied by the kondo effect , in which the hybridized moment - bearing ions in the lattice produce a characteristically enhanced scattering of the charge carriers , manifested as a local minimum and logarithmic increase of the resistivity with decreasing temperature.@xcite upon further cooling , dense kondo systems also crossover into a coherent scattering regime and a fermi - liquid ground state is established.@xcite these phenomena modify not only the transport but also the magnetic behavior at low temperatures , suppressing the susceptibility of the high temperature paramagnetic state.@xcite further manifestations appear in heat capacity measurements from which the estimated sommerfeld coefficient , that accounts for the total electronic density of states , takes an unusually high value that is associated with the electron effective mass renormalization .    a few years ago , torikachvili _ et al . _ characterized six new yb - based heavy fermion intermetallic compounds@xcite in the ybt@xmath0zn@xmath1 family ( t = fe , co , ru , rh , os and ir ) with sommerfeld coefficients @xmath6 @xmath12 400 mj / mol k@xmath2 .",
    "the rt@xmath0zn@xmath1 family adopts the complex cubic cecr@xmath0al@xmath1-type structure with space group @xmath13.@xcite r and t atoms occupy unique crystallographic sites ( wyckoff positions @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively ) and the zn atoms occupy three different crystallographic sites ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) .",
    "an important feature in this structure is that the r and t atoms are each surrounded by zn ions as nearest neighbors , in the form of cages ( 16 and 12 zn atoms respectively ) that leave a shortest r - r spacing of @xmath19   , as exemplified in fig .",
    "[ structure ] .",
    "the large cages made of numerous zn atoms have an effect of isolating the rare earths from each other , and result in only weak crystal electric field ( cef ) effects.@xcite studies on compounds of this family with non - hybridizing ions ( r = y , gd ) have demonstrated that the electronic bands near the fermi level created by the transition metal and the zn@xmath1 complex is by its own merit already rich in physical phenomena .",
    "for example , radically different magnetic behaviors are observed in the case of yco@xmath0zn@xmath1 , that shows pauli - like paramagnetic behavior ( dc magnetic susceptibility almost independent of the temperature ) compared to yfe@xmath0zn@xmath1 , reported as a compound close to the stoner limit@xcite in which the dc magnetic susceptibility has a strong dependence with the temperature .",
    "these different `` fermi seas '' , in which the @xmath20-band filling is very important , also drive the general behaviors of the equivalent compounds containing magnetic rare earths . as a striking example , one can find low - temperature antiferromagnetic order ( @xmath21  k ) in gdco@xmath0zn@xmath1 @xcite contrasting with high temperature ferromagnetic order ( @xmath22  k ) in gdfe@xmath0zn@xmath1.@xcite in the case of gdco@xmath0zn@xmath1 , we have recently reported that the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interaction can adequately explain the antiferromagnetic ordering of this compound@xcite as is expected in this diluted rare - earth system without electron - electron correlations .",
    "for gdfe@xmath0zn@xmath1 , however , a model that can quantitatively explain the ferromagnetic order with such high @xmath23 is still an open question.@xcite    in the case of the yb - based compounds,@xcite a strong influence of the environment in which this hybridizing rare earth is embedded is also notable , such as the two heavy fermion compounds ybfe@xmath0zn@xmath1 with @xmath24  mj / mol  k@xmath25 and ybco@xmath0zn@xmath1 with @xmath26  mj / mol  k@xmath25.@xcite    zn@xmath1 ( @xmath27   ) , highlighting the cn-16 frank - kasper polyhedron around the rare earth ions and the icosahedron around the transition metal ions.,width=321 ]    it is well known that the substitution of one element for another in a compound is one of the most versatile and powerful tools for the materials scientist to disturb the system in a controlled manner and subsequently track the evolution of its properties .",
    "one recent example in this family is the substitution of al for zn in the gdfe@xmath0zn@xmath1 compound , that can be understood as a combination of positive chemical pressure plus electron doping,@xcite leading to a drastic reduction of the ferromagnetic behavior .",
    "chemical substitutions in the yb - based members have not been reported yet , but hydrostatic pressures up to 8.23  gpa has been applied in the ybfe@xmath0zn@xmath1 compound,@xcite driving the characteristic kondo temperature t@xmath28 to lower temperatures and showing the loss of fermi liquid behavior . a critical pressure of 9.8  gpa was inferred in order to reach the quantum critical point in this system , so it is expected to be moving towards yb@xmath4 valence .",
    "conversely , in the case of the ybco@xmath0zn@xmath1 compound,@xcite it was suggested that the magnetic ordering transition occurs at a lower pressure , around 1 gpa . in order to attempt negative chemical pressure without electronic doping in this heavy fermion system ,",
    "we have performed cd - doping in single crystals of ybfe@xmath0zn@xmath1 .",
    "small amounts of cd substitution for zn indeed expand the crystal lattice as evidenced by x - ray diffraction , but more importantly , produce notorious changes in the magnetic , thermodynamic and transport properties , that complement previous studies applying positive ( physical ) pressure .",
    "an yb valence - shift scenario is then suggested as explanation for the observed physical changes .",
    "single crystalline samples of ybfe@xmath0zn@xmath29cd@xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) were grown out of excess zn using standard self - flux method.@xcite the constituent elements were 99.99@xmath32 yb ( ames ) , 99.9@xmath32 co , 99.9@xmath32 fe , 99.9999@xmath32 zn and 99.9999@xmath32 cd ( alfa - aesar ) .",
    "initial ratios of starting elements were @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) for the pseudo - quaternary system yb : fe : zn : cd .",
    "the elemental mixtures were sealed in an evacuated quartz ampoule and heated in a box furnace .",
    "crystals were grown by slowly cooling the melt between 1100  @xmath35c and 600  @xmath35c over 100  h. at 600 @xmath35c the ampoules were removed from the furnace , inverted and placed in a centrifuge to spin off the excess flux .",
    "the separated crystals are typically polyhedral , @xmath36  mm or larger .",
    "powder x - ray diffraction pattern of ybfe@xmath0zn@xmath29cd@xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "left inset shows the evolution of the lattice parameter showing an expansion of the unit cell also evidenced in the right inset that shows a shift to low angles of the diffraction pattern as a function of the cd amount.,width=321 ]    the effective cd concentrations @xmath37 on all of our samples were estimated using energy dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( eds ) measurements in a jeol model jsm-6010la scanning electron microscope with a vantage eds system .",
    "powder x - ray diffraction on finely crushed crystals at room temperature was used to ascertain the cecr@xmath0al@xmath1-type structure@xcite as exemplified in fig .",
    "measurements were performed on a stoe stadi - p powder diffractometer in transmission geometry by using a @xmath38 ( @xmath39 = 1.54056   ) wavelength emitted by a cu anode and selected by a curved ge(111 ) crystal , with a tube voltage of 40 kv and a current of 40 ma .",

    "the negative chemical pressure drives the kondo temperature of the system to higher values , and the regime of fermi - liquid behavior is extended , which agrees with and complements previous work applying positive physical pressure .",
