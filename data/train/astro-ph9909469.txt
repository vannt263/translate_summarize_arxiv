    ", the topic of low surface brightness galaxies has developed into a thriving area of scientific research ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent review ) .",
    "however uncertainty still remains as to whether such systems represent a major or minor component of the galaxy population or more fundamentally the mass budget .",
    "this uncertainty arises because of the difficulty in firstly establishing a complete catalog of galaxies and secondly in obtaining the necessary distance measurements .",
    "similarly the space density of intrinsically faint , or dwarf , galaxies is equally uncertain partly because they are predominantly of low surface brightness , but more fundamentally because the volumes over which dwarf galaxies have been surveyed are small ( c.f .",
    "in general the space density of galaxies is poorly constrained . and can be quantified as a factor of @xmath9 at @xmath7 rising to a factor of @xmath10 at @xmath11 , and indeterminate faint wards ( c.f . @xcite v s @xcite ) .",
    "what is required is an objective perspective of the entire local space density of galaxies . that is a _",
    "volume_-limited sample over a wide and well controlled range of surface brightness and intrinsic luminosity .",
    "here we show how such a sample can be constructed from the hubble deep field utilizing photometric redshifts and quantify the contribution to the local luminosity density from normal , dim and dwarf galaxies .",
    "we adopt a standard flat cosmology ( @xmath12 ) , with @xmath13 km s@xmath14mpc@xmath14 throughout .",
    "in @xcite we combined the photometric redshift catalog of @xcite with the morphological catalog of @xcite .",
    "this catalog has now been extended a further magnitude to @xmath15 ( now containing 675 galaxies ) , and updated to include quantitative measurements of the apparent half - light radii ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows a representation of this extended catalog by plotting each galaxy according to its redshift ( x - axis ) and its k - corrected absolute magnitude ( y - axis ) .",
    "these galaxies form a distribution which is bounded by the two appropriate apparent magnitude limits ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) . the reliability of photometric redshifts ( @xmath18 ) are discussed in @xcite . in figure  [ fig1 ]",
    "a horizontal line represents a sight - line across the past 10 gyrs for a narrow absolute magnitude range and a vertical line represents a _",
    "volume_-limited sample at a specified redshift ( within well defined magnitude and surface brightness limits ) . from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] a _ volume_-limited sample is _ i.e. _ any rectangle which lies within the apparent magnitude limits . as we wish to explore the _ local _ galaxy population we shall concentrate on the low - z range generously redefined to @xmath0 ( @xmath19 mpc@xmath1 ) .",
    "the final sample contains 47 galaxies .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows these galaxies plotted according to their mean absolute surface brightness and their absolute b - band magnitude .",
    "the selection lines shown on fig .  [ fig2 ] are discussed in detail in  3 .",
    "note that our chosen surface brightness measure is the intrinsic mean surface brightnesses ( @xmath20 ) within the effective radius .",
    "the effective radius is derived from the measured azimuthally averaged half - light radii within the 25 i(f814w ) mags per sq arcsecond isophote ( @xmath21 ) . hence : @xmath22 the measured @xmath21 values are taken from @xcite and the measured magnitudes and fitted k - corrections from @xcite .",
    "this measurement of the surface brightness includes the bulge component which explains why the values appear to be brighter than the more conventional extrapolated central surface brightness - typically 21.7 mags per sq arcsec for early - type disk systems @xcite .",
    "our motivation for using this measure of surface brightness is that no assumption of",
    "having arbitrarily defined our redshift limits our absolute magnitude limits are automatically set by the combination of these with the apparent magnitude constraints ( @xmath23 ) as follows : @xmath24 adopting @xmath25 and @xmath13kms@xmath14mpc@xmath14 , the distance moduli are : @xmath26 , @xmath27 . to be conservative we adopt a k - correction suitable for a blue galaxy ( @xmath28 ) at our upper limit and also a blue galaxy ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) for our lower limit @xcite .",
    "this results in a _ conservative _ absolute magnitude range for completeness of : @xmath2 - galaxies just outside this range can be detected but not over the entire 326 mpc@xmath1 volume .",
    "the shaded regions on fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] show these selection limits over all redshift intervals using a simplistic k - correction of k(z)=z .",
    "note that the paucity of objects in the shaded region lends credence to both the above magnitude limits and the reliability of photometric redshifts .",
    "the upper surface brightness limit is defined by the point at which a galaxy with the lowest possible apparent magnitude is contained within a single resolution element ( more luminous galaxies within a single pixel will have higher surface brightness measures ) . for",
    "any absolute magnitude this will occur at the highest possible redshift ( _ i.e. _ z=0.5 ) hence the limit can be defined as follows : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the distance modulus ( 41.7 ) and @xmath33 is the resolution limit of the drizzled wfpc2 data ( @xmath34 ) . conversely the dimmest measurable surface brightness is defined by two limits .",
    "firstly the fundamental isophotal detection limit at z=0.5 , i.e. : @xmath35 and secondly by the maximum size at which an object can be detected , @xmath36 ( typically fixed by the f.o.v . or size of any smoothing filter ) .",
    "this results in a selection line as follows : @xmath37 where @xmath26 , and @xmath38 .",
    "on figure  [ fig2 ] we map those objects with @xmath0 onto an effective absolute surface brightness versus absolute magnitude plane .",
    "those galaxies which lie within these selection boundaries represent the first _ volume limited _ census of the local galaxy population , _",
    "i.e. _ these 47 galaxies are a statistically uniform sample of the underlying galaxy population within these limits .",
    "in particular it surveys a larger volume for dim and dwarf galaxies than most ( @xmath39mpc@xmath1 ) , where peculiar motions and survey incompleteness become significant due to the extreme closeness of the volume . ]",
    "existing magnitude limited redshift surveys ( c.f .",
    "* ) , and extending to luminosities comparable to the brighter local group dwarfs ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "\\(1 ) * the majority of galaxies lie along a magnitude - surface brightness relation ( @xmath40 $ ] ) .",
    "* this is in very close agreement with that found for galaxies in the virgo cluster ( @xmath41 , @xcite ) .",
    "this trend has recently been predicted from theoretical arguments @xcite and through simulations of hierarchical merging ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "further work is required to allow direct comparisons between simulations - which in essence predict the mass versus angular momentum of the dark matter haloes - and observations - which determine the luminosity and surface brightness of the stellar population .",
    "it seems logical to suppose that the greater a galaxies angular momentum the lower will be its surface brightness .",
    "coupled with the accepted correlation between luminosity and mass , the bbd may represent a key connection between easily obtained observables and fundamental physical properties .",
    "\\(2 ) * low surface brightness luminous galaxies are relatively rare . * low surface brightness galaxies have been postulated as a potentially grossly overlooked population @xcite , within which might be contained a substantial integrated mass @xcite .",
    "no such objects were identified in our 326mpc@xmath1 volume . unless our volume is unrepresentative the constraint is that luminous lsbgs ( with @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) are rare accounting for @xmath44% of the total @xmath7 population .",
    "note that 21.7 mags per sq arcsec is adopted as the high / low surface brightness boundary , as this implies a system with a negligible bulge component .",
    "however we note that galaxies are known , such as malin1 @xcite , which would not be detectable even in the hdf sight - line ( due to both size and dimness ) .",
    "\\(3 ) * at @xmath0 dwarf galaxies are more numerous than giant galaxies*. dwarf galaxies have been proposed as an explanation to the faint blue galaxy problem ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) either by postulating a dense inert population of dwarfs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or through the recent fading of starbursting dwarfs to low surface brightness limits ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in these two cases it is required locally for the dwarf - to - giant ratio to be @xmath45 if non - evolving @xcite or a factor of @xmath46 if evolving @xcite . the level of dwarfs seen in fig",
    ".  [ fig1 ] ( dwarf - to - giant ratio = 1.4 ) does not support either of these scenarios .",
    "this suggests that while dwarf galaxies may contribute in part to the faint blue excess they can not be wholly responsible and a luminous population at higher redshift is also required ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "this dwarf - to - giant ratio is consistent with recent measures of the global luminosity function ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but inconsistent with the high dwarf - to - giant ratio of @xmath47 seen locally over the same absolute magnitude range @xcite . this may be due to the local volume being non - representative or alternatively due to the greater scrutiny of the local environment ( i.e. even lower optical surface brightness limits and radio surveys ) .",
    "having constructed a volume - limited sample it is trivial to derive the luminosity - density of the universe , _ i.e. _ @xmath48 .",
    "this is a fundamental parameter useful for cosmological purposes and can be combined with the maximum observed mass - to - light ratio to obtain an _ upper limit _ to @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "table  [ table1 ] shows the results for our hdf volume - limited sample for all galaxies and also for subdivisions into giant ( i.e. classical hubble types ) , dim ( i.e. lsbg disks ) and dwarf systems . of interest , is that the value itself is typically 3 - 4 times larger than that obtained from local surveys .",
    "this is most likely a statistical variation due to the small volume surveyed",
    ". however it may also be a reiteration of a classic problem of faint galaxy models , namely the steepness of the local galaxy counts @xcite .",
    "finally we can now address the long standing question as to the cosmological importance of low surface brightness and dwarf galaxies .",
    "table  [ table1 ] shows the luminosity density for subregions of the bbd which fit with our definitions of high surface brightness giants , low surface brightness giants and dwarf galaxies as indicated . adopting an invariant mass - to - light ratio these values for the luminosity density would correspond directly to the percentage contribution to the galaxy mass density .",
    "however studies of both low surface brightness galaxies and dwarf galaxies suggest mass - to - light ratios typically increase towards both lower luminosity and lower surface brightnesses @xcite .",
    "more work is require in this area , however for the moment we consider the results presented by @xcite based on observed tully - fisher relationships for low surface brightness galaxies of @xmath50 .",
    "we normalize this expression to the data of @xcite , to give an @xmath51 for normal high surface brightness disks ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the percentages based on these numbers are also shown in the final two columns of table  [ table1 ] which finally reflects the local cosmological significance of high surface brightness , low surface brightness and dwarf galaxies .",
    "to first order we see that high surface brightness galaxies dominate both the luminosity density and to a slightly lesser extent the mass budget .",
    "nevertheless the contribution from both low surface brightness and dwarf galaxies is non - negligible and may be partly responsible for the variation seen in measures of the local luminosity function ( c.f .  1 ) .",
    "we have demonstrated that a _ volume_-limited sample over a wide and well defined magnitude and surface - brightness range can be constructed from the hubble deep field and hence any deep , high resolution multi - color imaging survey .",
    "the volume - limited data has been mapped onto the first bivariate brightness distribution ( bbd ) for field galaxies . a clear result is a strong luminosity - surface brightness relationship similar to that reported in the virgo cluster .",
    "we advocate the possible potential of the bbd as a meeting point between simulations and observations by noting the logical connections between surface brightness & angular momentum and luminosity & mass .",
    "if shown to be true the bbd may represent a new and powerful tool with which to trace galaxy evolution and environmental dependencies .",
    "more specifically the measured bbd over the 326 mpc@xmath1 volume and valid for @xmath0 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 shows no luminous low surface brightness galaxies and only a modest dwarf population .",
    "hence we conclude that no evidence is seen for a `` missing '' local population ( within the above specified limits ) . in terms of the luminosity density and mass density",
    "we conclude that locally high surface brightness giant galaxies dominate both the luminosity density ( 88 % ) and the galaxy contribution to the mass density of the local universe ( 72 % ) .",
    "if a hierarchical model of galaxy formation is correct then these contributions will decrease with redshift .",
