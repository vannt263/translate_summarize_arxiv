    "in the past few years a match among the study of systems defined on lattices by means of statistical mechanics @xcite and the study of networks by means of graph theory @xcite gave origin to very interesting models as the small world magnets @xcite@xcite or the scale free networks @xcite .",
    "however a complete analysis starting from the simple fully connected mean field ising model @xcite@xcite up to these recent complex models @xcite is still not complete ( even thought several important steps have been obtained , examples being @xcite@xcite@xcite ) and important models have not yet been taken into account . among these a certain role is played by the mean field diluted ising model : an erdos - renyi networks @xcite which has spins as nodes and their interactions as links .",
    "the interactions are encoded in a matrix connecting pairs of spins which , when the connectivity allows the link to be present , shares the same value for all the couples . despite their easy formalization @xcite ,",
    "diluted ferromagnets are poorly investigated by rigorous tools @xcite .",
    "inspired by a recent work on these systems in which the authors presented a detailed analysis of the ergodic region and the zero temperature line @xcite we extend recent techniques developed in a series of papers @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite to this model with the aim of analyzing its critical behavior .",
    "we systematically develop the interpolating cavity field method @xcite and use it to sketch the derivation of a free energy expansion : the higher the order of the expansion , the deeper we could go beyond the ergodic region . within this framework",
    "we perform a detailed analysis of the scaling of magnetization ( and susceptibility ) at the critical line .",
    "the critical exponents turn out to be the classical ones . at the end",
    "we perform extensive monte carlo ( mc ) simulations for different graph sizes and bond concentrations and we compare results with theory . indeed , also numerically",
    ", we provide evidence that the universality class of the diluted ising model is independent of dilution .",
    "in fact the critical exponents we measured are consistent with those pertaining to the curie - weiss model , in agreement with analytical results .",
    "the critical line is also well reproduced .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ( [ laa ] ) we describe the model , in section ( [ cavatappi ] ) we introduce the cavity field technique , which constitutes the framework we are going to use in section ( [ lac ] ) to investigate the free energy of the system at general values of temperature and dilution . section ( [ critico ] ) deals with the criticality of the model ; there we find the critical line and the critical behavior of the main order parameter , i.e. magnetization , we provide its self - averaging and work out a picture by which we explain the breaking of the ergodicity . section ( [ numerics ] ) is devoted to numerical investigations , especially focused on criticality .",
    "finally , section ( [ conclusions ] ) is left for outlook and conclusions .",
    "given @xmath0 points and families @xmath1 of i.i.d random variables uniformly distributed on these points , the ( random ) hamiltonian of the diluted curie - weiss model is defined on ising @xmath0-spin configurations @xmath2 through @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a poisson random variable with mean @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the connectivity .",
    "the expectation with respect to all the ( _ quenched _ ) random variables defined so far will be denoted by @xmath7 , while the gibbs expectation at inverse temperature @xmath8 with respect to this hamiltonian will be denoted by @xmath9 , and depends clearly on @xmath10 and @xmath8 .",
    "we also define @xmath11 .",
    "the pressure , i.e. minus @xmath8 times the free energy , is by definition @xmath12 where we implicitly introduced the partition function @xmath13 too .",
    "when we omit the dependence on @xmath0 we mean to have taken the thermodynamic limit which we assume to exist for all the observables we deal with , in particular for the free energy @xcite@xcite@xcite ( however we will look for a more firm ground on this point by numerical investigation in sec.([numerics ] ) ) .",
    "the quantities encoding the thermodynamic properties of the model are the overlaps , which are defined on several configurations ( _ replicas _ ) @xmath14 by @xmath15 particular attention must be payed on @xmath16 which is called _",
    "magnetization_. when dealing with several replicas , the gibbs measure is simply the product measure , with the same realization of the quenched variables , but the expectation @xmath7 destroys the factorization .",
    "sometimes for the sake of simplicity we will call @xmath17 .",
    "in this section at first we introduce the cavity field technique on the line of @xcite by expressing the hamiltonian of a system made of @xmath18 spins through the hamiltonian of n spins by scaling the connectivity degree @xmath10 and neglecting vanishing terms in n as follows h_n+1 ( ) = -_=1^p_(n+1 ) _ i__j _ ~-_=1^p _ n _ i__j _ - _ = 1^p_2 _ i__n+1 such that we can use the more compact expression @xmath19 with [ decompo ] = , _ n ( ) = - _ = 1^p_2 _",
    "i_. so we see that we can express the hamiltonian of @xmath18 particles via the one of @xmath0 particles , paying two prices : the first is a rescaling in the connectivity ( vanishing in the thermodynamic limit ) , the second being an added term , which will be encoded , at the level of the thermodynamics , by a suitably cavity function as follows : let us introduce an interpolating parameter @xmath20 $ ] and the cavity function @xmath21 given by @xmath22 = \\lim_{n\\rightarrow \\infty } \\mathbb{e}\\big[\\ln \\frac{z_{n , t}(\\tilde{\\alpha},\\beta ) } { z_{n}(\\tilde{\\alpha},\\beta)}\\big].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the three terms appearing in the decomposition ( [ hsplit ] ) give rise to the structure of the following theorem :    [ main ] in the @xmath23 limit , the free energy per spin is allowed to assume the following representation a ( , ) = 2 - + ( , ; t=1 )    * proof * consider the @xmath18 spin partition function @xmath24 and let us split it as suggested by eq .",

    "( actually we still do not have a complete proof of the existence of the thermodynamic limit but we will provide strong numerical evidences in section [ numerics ] ) @xmath37    hence , we can express the free energy via the energy and the cavity function .",
    "while it is well known how to deal with the energy @xcite , the same can not be stated for the cavity function , and we want to develop its expansion via suitably chosen overlap monomials in a spirit close to the stochastic stability @xcite@xcite@xcite , such that , at the end , we will not have the analytical solution for the free energy in the whole @xmath38 plane , but we will manage its expansion close ( immediately below ) to the critical line . to see how the machinery works ,",
    "let us start by giving some definitions and proving some simple theorems :    we define the t - dependent boltzmann state @xmath39 as @xmath40 where @xmath41 extends the classical partition function in the same spirit of the numerator of eq.([dante ] ) .",
    "as we will often deal with several overlap monomials let us divide them among two big categories :    we can split the class of monomials of the order parameters in two families :    * we define _ filled _ or equivalently _ stochastically stable _ all the overlap monomials built by an even number of the same replicas ( i.e. @xmath42 ,  @xmath43 ,  @xmath44 ) .",
    "* we define _ fillable _ or equivalently _ saturable _ all the overlap monomials which are not stochastically stable ( i.e. @xmath45 ,  @xmath46 ,  @xmath47 )    we are going to show three theorems that will play a guiding role for our expansion : as this approach has been deeply developed in similar contexts ( as fully connected ising model @xcite or fully connected spin glasses @xcite or diluted spin glasses @xcite , which are the boundaries of the model of this paper ) we will not show all the details of the proof , but we sketch them as they are really intuitive . the interested reader can deepen this point by looking at the original works .",
    "[ ciccia ] for large @xmath0 , setting @xmath48 we have _",
    "n , t(_i_1_i_2 ... _i_n ) = _",
    "n+1(_i_1_i_2 ... _i_n_n+1^n ) + o()such that in the thermodynamic limit , if @xmath48 , the boltzmann average of a fillable multi - overlap monomial turns out to be the boltzmann average of the corresponding filled multi - overlap monomial .",
    "[ saturabili ] let @xmath49 be a fillable monomial of the overlaps ( this means that there exists a multi - overlap @xmath50 such that @xmath51 is filled ) .",
    "n_t1 q_2n _ t = q_2nq_2n ( examples : for @xmath52 we get @xmath53 )    [ saturi ] in the @xmath54 limit the averages @xmath55 of the filled monomials are t - independent in @xmath8 average .",
    "* proof * in this sketch we are going to show how to get theorem ( [ ciccia ] ) in some details ; it automatically has as a corollary theorem ( [ saturabili ] ) which ultimately gives , as a simple consequence when applied on filled monomials , theorem ( [ saturi ] ) .",
    "let us assume for a generic overlap correlation function @xmath56 , of @xmath57 replicas , the following representation @xmath58 where @xmath59 labels the replicas , the internal product takes into account the spins ( labeled by @xmath60 ) which contribute to the _ a_-part of the overlap @xmath61 and runs to the number of time that the replica @xmath59 appears in @xmath56 , the external product takes into account all the contributions of the internal one and the @xmath62 factor fixes the constraints among different replicas in @xmath56 ; so , for example , @xmath63 can be decomposed in this form noting that @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , where the @xmath67 functions fixes the links between replicas @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the averaged overlap correlation function is @xmath70 now if @xmath56 is a fillable polynomial , and we evaluate it at @xmath48 , let us decompose it , using the factorization of the @xmath71 state on different replica , as @xmath72 where @xmath73 stands for the number of the unfilled replicas inside the expression of @xmath56 .",
    "so we split the measure @xmath9 into two different subset @xmath74 and @xmath75 : in this way the replica belonging to the @xmath76 subset are always in even number , while the ones in the @xmath59 subset are always odds .",
    "applying the gauge @xmath77 the even measure is unaffected by this transformation @xmath78 while the odd measure takes a @xmath27 inside the boltzmann measure .",

    "@xmath37 it is now immediate to understand that the effect of theorem ( [ ciccia ] ) on a fillable overlap monomial is to multiply it by its missing part to be filled ( theorem [ saturabili ] ) , while it has no effect if the overlap monomial is already filled ( theorem [ saturi ] ) because of the ising spins ( i.e. @xmath84 ) .",
    "now the plan is as follows : we calculate the @xmath85-streaming of the @xmath86 function in order to derive it and then integrate it back once we have been able to express it as an expansion in power series of @xmath85 with stochastically stable overlaps as coefficients . at the end",

    "the idea is as follows : due to the second order nature of the phase transition for this model ( i.e. criticality that so far is assumed ) we can expand the free energy in terms of the whole series of order parameters .",
    "of course it is impossible to manage all these infinite overlap correlation functions to get a full solution of the model in the whole ( @xmath103 ) plane but it is possible to show by rigorous bounds that close to the critical line ( that we are going to find soon ) higher order overlaps scale with higher order critical exponents so we are allowed to neglect higher orders close to this line and we can investigate deeply criticality , which is the topic of the paper . to this task let us expand the cavity functions as @xmath104 where @xmath105 for @xmath23 . now using the streaming equation",

    "of course we are neglecting @xmath123 higher order terms because we are interested in an expansion holding close to the critical line , but we are not allowed to truncate the series for a general point in the phase space far beyond the ergodic region .",
    "now we want to analyze the critical behavior of the model : we find the critical line where the ergodicity breaks , we obtain the critical exponent of the magnetization and the susceptibility and at the end we show that within our framework the lacking of ergodicity can be explained as the breaking of commutativity of the infinite volume limit against our cavity field , thought of as a properly chosen field , vanishing in the thermodynamic limit too , accordingly with the standard prescription of statistical mechanics @xcite .",

    "again for simplicity we report the expansion of @xmath150 we have previously built @xmath167 that we obtained by considering the cavity function as the integral of its @xmath85-derivative @xmath168 and performing , via the streaming equation , a saturating procedure of consecutive @xmath85-derivatives upon the overlaps in order to express them as functions of higher order filled terms .",
    "then the only thing we had to do was sending @xmath0 to infinity , carrying out of the integral the overlaps and then putting @xmath48 to evaluate @xmath169 .",
    "the result of this procedure brings to equation ( [ afinale ] ) .",
    "but what if we exchanged the limit order by sending @xmath170 first and taking the thermodynamic limit after ?",
    "it is easy to note that all the overlaps appearing in eq.([cavita ] ) are fillable such that we can avoid the saturation procedure simply by setting @xmath48 first and then sending n to infinity . in this way , thanks to theorem ( [ saturabili ] ) , each fillable overlap is transformed in a filled @xmath85-independent one and this kills all the correlations among different replicas and allows us to write @xmath171 being clearly @xmath172 \\\\ \\nonumber & = & 2\\alpha\\ln\\cosh\\beta - 2\\alpha \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty } \\frac{(-1)^n}{n } \\theta^{n } \\langle q_{1, ..",

    "when the system lives in the ergodic region all the order parameters are zero and it reduces to @xmath177 which is the ergodic solution , if we cross the critical line the formula takes into account the phase transition encoded in the coefficient of the second order and gives the correct expression immediately below .",
    "it is also straightforward to recognize as the ergodic solution eq.([52 ] ) which can be the correct one only above the critical line @xcite . at the end we saw that there exists only and only one critical line for all the order parameters .",
    "we saw that this line can be depicted as the breaking of commutativity among the infinite limit operation and the setting of @xmath48 ( relaxing the boltzmann factor from the interpolant avoiding the trivial way @xmath93 ) . hence , which can be the genesis of the transition for all the other order parameters ?",
    "the correlations among them and the magnetization , as clearly put in evidence in the free energy expansion ( see eq.([a ] ) ) . and",
    "lastly , which is the origin of these correlation ?",
    "saturability property _ that the model exhibits as stated by theorem ( [ saturabili ] ) .",
    "in fact , at the critical line ( which is the last line , from above , where gauge invariance is a symmetry of the boltzmann state too , thanks to the continuity of the transition ) saturability easily shows that _",
    "n m_1 q_12 _ t = m_1 m_2 q_12 , explaining the birth of the correlations among the various order parameters ( we reported just the first two as an example ) .",
    "we have previously shown how filled overlaps become asymptotically @xmath85-independent when n grows to infinity .",
    "starting from this we can find identities stating the self - averaging of the order parameters as @xmath147 .",
    "in particular we are going to take these overlaps and calculate their derivative with respect to @xmath85 ; then by applying the gauge transformation and setting @xmath178 we can write down the self - averaging relations . @xmath179 \\rightarrow [ \\langle m_1 ^ 4 \\rangle - \\langle m_1 ^ 2m_2 ^ 2 \\rangle ] = \\mathbb{e}[\\omega(m^4 ) - \\omega^2(m^2)].\\ ] ] coherently with @xcite we find standard self - averaging for the magnetization .",
    "more interesting is the situation concerning the overlap but we actually lack a complete mathematical control . by applying the same trick as before we can equate to zero ( in the large @xmath0 limit ) the @xmath85-derivative of the squared overlap ( which is stochastically stable ) ,",
    "consequently we get two terms .",
    "@xmath180 + \\beta'\\theta[\\langle q_{12}^3 \\rangle_t - 4\\langle q_{12}^2q_{13}\\rangle_t + 3\\langle q_{12}^2q_{34 } \\rangle_t ] \\\\",
    "\\label{ipotesi } & \\rightarrow & [ \\langle m_1 ^",
    "2q_{12}^2 \\rangle - \\langle m_3 ^ 2q_{12}^2 \\rangle ] = 0 \\qquad",
    "[ \\langle q_{12}^4 \\rangle - 4\\langle q_{12}^2q_{13}^2\\rangle + 3\\langle q_{12}^2q_{34}^2 \\rangle ] = 0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a - priori we can not assume factorization of the series so to put to zero each term separately ( as we did in eq.([ipotesi ] ) ) , however , close to the critical line surely the second term is an higher order and we can reasonably set to zero the first .",
    "furthermore as the second term at the r.h.s . has a pre - factor @xmath181 differing from the first term it would be difficult to imagine the opposite .",
    "it is in fact very natural to assume that the two terms can be set to zero separately in the whole @xmath38 plane and this is very interesting because the second term is a very well known relation in the field of spin glasses @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite suggesting a common structure among different kinds of disordered systems , the only sharing feature among diluted ferromagnets and spin - glasses being some kind of disorder ( topological in the former , frustrating in the latter ) .",
    "we are not going to deepen this point as it is under investigation in @xcite where the same set of relations ( and more ) is found and discussed .",
    "in this section we analyze , from the numerical point of view , the ferromagnetic system previously introduced by performing extensive monte carlo simulations with the metropolis algorithm @xcite .",
    "the erdos - renyi random graph is constructed by taking @xmath0 sites and introducing a bond between each pair of sites with probability @xmath182 , in such a way that the average connectivity per node is just @xmath183 . clearly , when @xmath184 the complete graph is recovered .",
    "the simplest version of the diluted curie - weiss hamiltonian has a poisson variable per bond as @xmath185 , and it is the easiest approach when dealing with numerics . for the analytical investigation",
    "we choose a slightly changed version ( see eq.([ham ] ) ) : each link gets a bond with probability close to @xmath186 for large @xmath0 ; the probabilities of getting two , three bonds scale as @xmath187 therefore negligible in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "working with directed links ( as we do in the analytical framework ) the probability of having a bond on any undirected link is twice the probability for directed link ( i.e. @xmath188 ) .",
    "hence , for large @xmath0 , each site has average connectivity @xmath189 .",
    "finally in this way we allow self - loop but they add just @xmath190-independent constant to @xmath191 and are irrelevant , but we take the advantage of dealing with an @xmath191 which is the sum of independent identically distributed random variables , that is useful for analytical investigation . when comparing with numerics consequently",
    "we must keep in mind that @xmath192 . in the simulation , once the network has been diluted , we place a spin @xmath193 on each node @xmath194 and allow it to interact with its nearest - neighbors .",
    "once the external parameter @xmath8 is fixed , the system is driven by the single - spin dynamics and it eventually relaxes to a stationary state characterized by well - defined properties .",
    "more precisely , after a suitable time lapse @xmath195 and for sufficiently large systems , measurements of a ( specific ) physical observable @xmath196 fluctuate around an average value only depending on the external parameters @xmath197 and @xmath183 . moreover , for a system @xmath198 of a given finite size @xmath0 the extent of such fluctuations scales as @xmath199 with the size of the system .",
    "the estimate of the thermodynamic observables @xmath200 is therefore obtained as an average over a suitable number of ( uncorrelated ) measurements performed when the system is reasonably close to the equilibrium regime .",
    "the estimate is further improved by averaging over different realizations of the same system @xmath198 . in summary , @xmath201 , \\ ; \\ ; t_n = t_0+n\\mathcal{t}\\ ] ] where @xmath202 denotes the configuration of the magnetic system at time step @xmath85 and @xmath203 is the decorrelation parameter ( i.e. the time , in units of spin flips , needed to decorrelate a given magnetic arrangement ) . in general , statistical errors during a mc run in a given sample result to be significantly smaller than those arising from the ensemble averaging ( see also @xcite ) .    finite size scaling for the magnetization and the internal energy ( inset ) for @xmath204 and @xmath205 .",
