    "during the experiments developed in the 1950s , the german cardiologist gerhart liebau observed ( see @xcite ) that a periodic compression could produce the circulation of a fluid in a  mechanical system without valves to ensure the direction of the flow .",

    "however , the apparently simplest configuration consisting of 1 pipe and 1 tank turned out to be , from mathematical point of view , the most interesting one , as it leads to the singular periodic problem @xmath0 ,    \\\\[1 mm ]     u(0)=u(t),\\quad u'(0)=u'(t ) , \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the fluid velocity in the pipe ( oriented in the direction from the tank to the piston ) , @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 is the friction coefficient , @xmath5 is the density of the fluid , @xmath6 is the junction coefficient ( depending on the particular geometry and smoothness of the junction of the tank and the pipe ) , @xmath7 is the acceleration of gravity , @xmath8 is the cross section of the tank , @xmath9 is the cross section of the pipe ( small in comparison with @xmath10 ) , @xmath11 is the total volume ( assumed to be constant ) of the fluid in the system and @xmath12 is the @xmath13-periodic external force . as a result , from the fluid mechanics point of view , the assumptions @xmath14 are quite natural , from @xmath6 we would even have @xmath15 . of course , we are interested in the search of positive solutions of problem . a detailed justification of the model can be also found e.g. in ( * ? ? ?",
