    "it is well known that the relative abundances of the light elements created in the first few minutes of cosmic history depend on the product of the present - day density of baryons in units of the critical density , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the present - day value of the hubble parameter measured in units of 100 km  s@xmath15  mpc@xmath15 .",
    "when analysed in conjunction with the the power spectrum of temperature anisotropies of the cosmic background radiation ( cmb ) , light element abundances can improve constraints on cosmological parameters , primarily the spectral index of primordial fluctuations ( pettini et al .",
    "2008 ) , and on the effective number of light fermion species , @xmath16 ( e.g. simha & steigman 2008 ; nollett & holder 2011 ) .    among the elements created in big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) ,",
    "three have been the focus of most observational efforts : @xmath10he , d and @xmath11li .",
    "it is a lingering concern that d is the only one of the three whose primordial abundance is consistent , within the errors , with the value of @xmath17 deduced from the analysis of the cmb .",
    "the poor sensitivity of the primordial abundance of @xmath10he to @xmath17 requires it to be measured with a precision which may be beyond what can be realistically achieved , at least until all the sources of systematic error are fully understood ( molaro 2008 ; aver , olive & skillman 2012 ) .",
    "on the other hand , a satisfactory explanation for the factor of @xmath18 discrepancy between the abundances of @xmath11li in the oldest stars in our galaxy and the value expected from bbn has yet to be found ( sbordone et al .",
    "2010 ; iocco 2012 ; nissen & schuster 2012 and references therein ) .",
    "even d is not entirely without its problems .",
    "as presciently pointed out by adams ( 1976 ) , its primordial abundance is most effectively deduced from the d / h ratio in metal - poor hydrogen clouds giving rise to absorption lines in the spectra of high redshift quasars ( qsos ) .",
    "this is a difficult measurement , requiring not only the combined power of 810 m aperture optical telescopes and high resolution echelle spectrographs , but also the right combination of redshift , hydrogen column density , and internal velocity structure of the absorbing gas .",
    "consequently , there are currently only about 10 qso absorbers where the di lines have been unambigously detected free from interference from unrelated absorption .",
    "the mean value so derived , @xmath19 ( fumagalli et al . 2011 ) implies @xmath20 which agrees within the errors with @xmath21 ( keisler et al .",
    "less satisfactory is the fact that even this prime set of d / h measures exhibits a wider dispersion about the mean than expected on the basis of the quoted errors . while the most straightforward explanation of the scatter is that systematic errors affecting some , or all , of the d / h measurements have been underestimated , more radical ideas involving early destruction of d",
    "have also been proposed ( e.g. olive et al .",
    "2012 ) .    given the key role played by d in our understanding of bbn , it is important to identify and study more qso absorbers with the optimum characteristics for the determination of the primordial d abundance ( d / h)@xmath4 .",
    "this is the subject of the present paper .      among the different classes of qso absorbers ,",
    "the so - called ` damped lyman alpha systems ' ( dlas ) are potentially the best targets for reliable measures of ( d / h)@xmath4 .",
    "dlas are characterised by high column densities of neutral gas , with @xmath22(hi)@xmath23atoms  @xmath24 ( wolfe et al . 2005 ) , and appear to be associated with galaxies at early stages of chemical evolution ( pontzen et al .",
    "2008 ; proux et al .",
    "2012 ; krogager et al .",
    "typical metallicities at redshifts @xmath254 are @xmath26@xmath27 ( ellison et al .",
    "2012 ) , but with a tail that extends to @xmath28 ( penprase et al . 2010 ; cooke et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "the number of known dlas with metallicities less than 1/100 of solar has increased in recent years thanks to large scale sky surveys ( noterdaeme et al . 2009 ) , and it is these systems that have proved to be choice candidates for measuring ( d / h)@xmath4 for the following reasons : ( i ) the low metallicities imply negligible d astration ( romano et al .",
    "2006 ; prodanovi et al .",
    "2010 ) , justifying the assumption that ( d / h)@xmath29 ; ( ii ) the high hi column densities result in detectable optical depths of di absorption in _ many _ lines in the lyman series .",
    "this both increases the accuracy of the measurement of @xmath22(di ) compared with lower column density systems , where di absorption is detected only in the strongest lyman lines ( e.g. burles & tytler 1998a , b ) , and reduces the likelihood of contamination by unrelated absorption ; ( iii ) the empirical correlation between metallicity and absorption line width ( murphy et al .",
    "2007 ; prochaska et al . 2008 ) implies that the kinematics of @xmath30 dlas are normally quiescent , with the absorption lines extending over a narrow velocity interval ( cooke et al .",
    "such kinematics greatly facilitate resolving the @xmath31 km  s@xmath15 isotope shift of the di lyman lines from the neighbouring hi absorption .    thus , several of the very metal - poor dlas in the recent survey by cooke et al .",
    "( 2011 ) are promising candidates for further observations targeting the high order di and hi lyman lines redshifted into the ground - base uv spectral region ( @xmath32 ) . in this paper",
    "we report the analysis of what we consider to be the most suitable case in the sample by cooke et al .",
    "( 2011 ) for determining the primordial abundance of d with a higher precision than is normally achievable .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in section  [ sec : obs ] we briefly describe the observations ( which have already been reported by cooke et al .",
    "2011 ) and summarise the most important properties of the dla .",
    "sections  [ sec : dtoh ] and [ sec : errors ] are devoted to the derivation of the d / h ratio and its error , respectively .",
    "in section  [ sec : cosmo ] we examine the cosmological implications which follow if the value of d / h deduced here is indeed the best measure of the primordial abundance of deuterium .",
    "we comment on earlier measurements of ( d / h)@xmath4 in section  [ sec : others ] , before concluding in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "the spectrum of the @xmath33mag qso sdss  j1419@xmath30829 at @xmath2 shows a damped lyman alpha system at @xmath1 ; the small redshift difference between ly@xmath34 emission and absorption results in an unusually ` clean ' ly@xmath34  absorption profile , with a red wing which is essentially free from overlapping absorption by intergalactic gas ( see fig .  7 of cooke et al .",
    "consequently , the column density of hi is particularly well determined .",
    "details of the acquisition and reduction of the spectrum of this qso can be found in cooke et al .",
    "( 2011 ) ; here , we summarise the most important points . the spectrum was recorded with the ultraviolet and visual echelle spectrograph ( uves ; dekker et al .",
    "2000 ) mounted on ut 2 of the very large telescope facility .",
    "the observations were carried out in service mode and consisted of a series of 2700s exposures ; the total integration time was 29800s .",
    "the echelle spectra were reduced with the standard uves pipeline and then combined with the software package uves_poplermmurphy / uves_popler ] which merges individual echelle orders and maps the data onto a vacuum heliocentric wavelength scale .",
    "flux calibration was achieved by reference to the sloan digital sky survey spectrum of the qso .",
    "the final reduced spectrum covers the wavelength range @xmath356652(@xmath361642  in the rest frame of the dla ) with resolving power @xmath37 ( velocity resolution fwhm@xmath38 km  s@xmath15 ) sampled with @xmath18pixels .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of the data is relatively high considering the magnitude of the source and the high spectral dispersion : @xmath39 at 5000 , and @xmath40 over the entire dla lyman series ( these are values per pixel in the continuum ) .",
    "cooke et al . ( 2011 ) deduced @xmath41 .",
    "their analysis of 19 transitions of ni , oi , siii , and feii showed that the metal lines consist of two absorption components of approximately equal optical depth , separated by @xmath42 km  s@xmath15 at @xmath43 and 3.049835 respectively .",
    "the doppler parameters of the two components are @xmath44 and 6.4 km  s@xmath15 respectively , where @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is the 1-d velocity dispersion of the absorbers projected along the line of sight .",
    "the metallicity of the dla is approximately 1/100 of solar : [ o / h]@xmath47 , [ si / h]@xmath48 , and [ fe / h]@xmath49 in the usual notation whereby [ x / h]@xmath50 . in fig .  [ fig : metal_lines ] we have reproduced examples of the metal lines in the dla .",
    "for the reasons outlined above , the spectral characteristics of this dla are near - ideal for an accurate determination of the d / h ratio and a realistic assessment of its precision .",
    "to take advantage of this opportunity , we have performed a detailed spectral analysis in which we identify all of the parameters which potentially affect the derivation of the d / h ratio from the uves spectrum of j1419@xmath30829 , and then use a purpose - built code to solve _ for all of them simultaneously _",
    "( via a @xmath51 statistic ) and thereby deduce the best fitting value of d / h in the dla .",
    "random and systematic errors affecting this determination were estimated using monte carlo techniques .",
    "we now discuss the whole procedure in detail .",
    "the absorption lines in the dla are seen against the continuum and emission line radiation from the qso ; the exact level of this flux as a function of wavelength affects directly the measured line optical depths .",
    "reconstruction of the qso intrinsic spectrum is particularly important for the hi ly@xmath34   absorption line which : ( i ) is blended with the qso ly@xmath34  and nv  @xmath52 emission lines and ( ii ) affords the best constraint on @xmath22(hi ) .",
    "we approximated the qso flux in the wavelength regions of interest by modelling the qso intrinsic spectrum with a power - law continuum on which are superimposed a number of emission lines ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : qsofit1 ] ) .",
    "the free parameters that were varied to arrive at the optimum fit ( i.e. the fit giving the minimum value of @xmath51 ) are : ( i ) the slope and ( ii ) scaling constant of the power - law continuum , and ( iii ) the redshifts , ( iv ) amplitudes and ( v ) widths of the emission lines .",
    "multiplet wavelengths for the emission lines were taken from morton ( 2003 ) .",
    "we found that three sets of emission line redshifts were required to reproduce adequately the qso emission line spectrum : a component at @xmath53 is seen in emission lines of ionised species ( ciii , civ , niv , nv , siiii , tiiii ) and in ly@xmath34 ; a lower redshift component at @xmath54 further contributes to high ionisation lines ( civ and nv ) and to ly@xmath34 , while emission lines from low ionisation species ( cii , oi , and siii ) are centred at @xmath55 . the final fit is shown in red in fig .",
    "[ fig : qsofit1 ] , where the locations of the different emission line components are colour - coded .",
    "the region around siiv@xmath56 was not included in the fit because this emission line falls in a gap between the ccd chips on the uves detector .",
    "[ fig : qsofit2 ] shows the region near the ly@xmath34  emission+absorption composite before and after division by the qso flux .",
    "further fine adjustments were applied to the continuum level in the proximity of the absorption lines to be analysed by fitting low order polynomials to spectral intervals deemed to be free of absorption .",
    "our uves spectrum of j1419@xmath30829 includes 19 metal absorption lines associated with the @xmath1 dla ; the analysis of these features and ensuing abundance determinations have been reported by cooke et al .",
    "( 2011 ) . also covered by our spectrum",
    "is the entire lyman series of the dla , from ly@xmath34  to the lyman limit .",
    "beyond ly14 ( i.e. for transitions between the ground state and levels with principal quantum number @xmath57 ) the line wavelengths differ by @xmath58and can no longer be resolved from one another . however , in 8 out of the 14 transitions from ly@xmath34  to ly14 , the di absorption can be separated from the corresponding hi and is clear of other blends ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : dlines ] ) .",
    "the @xmath59-values of the transitions in which di is available for analysis range from 0.013940 ( ly@xmath60 ) to 0.000469 ( ly14 ) ; this factor of @xmath61 spread in line strength provides a wide baseline on the curve of growth for an accurate measurement of @xmath22(di ) .          while only two absorption components are evident in the metal lines analysed by cooke et al .",
    "( 2011 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : metal_lines ] ) , an additional , redshifted component was found to contribute to the hi absorption .",
    "this component , separated by @xmath62 km  s@xmath15 from the redshift of the dla , has only @xmath63 the column density of the dla , which explains why its presence can not be discerned in the metal lines ( recall that in this dla @xmath64 and other metals are even less abundant ) . even though its contribution to the di absorption is minimal ,",
    "this additional component is included in the di lines by construction since , as explained below , our fitting procedure solves directly for the di / hi ratio , rather than separately for @xmath22(di ) and @xmath22(hi ) in individual components .",
    "the absorption from each component is characterised by four parameters : ( i ) redshift @xmath65 , ( ii ) column density @xmath22 , ( iii ) temperature @xmath66 , and ( iv ) large - scale velocity dispersion .",
    "the last of these is assumed to be the same for all atoms and ions in the dla , and is quantified by a turbulent doppler parameter @xmath67 . on the other hand , a given temperature will correspond to different thermal doppler parameters for elements of different masses according to the relation @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the two contributions to the line widths add in quadrature : @xmath70 .",
    "the observation that the two components are unresolved in the di lines while they are partially resolved in the metal lines ( compare figs .",
    "[ fig : metal_lines ] and [ fig : dlines ] ) reflects the larger values of @xmath71 for the lighter d compared to the metals , and leads to the conclusion that in this dla thermal broadening makes a non - negligible contribution to the line width .",
    "thus , in fitting the absorption line spectrum of the dla , we varied simultaneously @xmath65 , @xmath22 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 for each of the two main components of the hi , di and metal lines .",
    "( for the third component seen only in hi we varied @xmath65 , @xmath22 , and @xmath72 ) .",
    "the parameters defining the qso continuum in the proximity of the ly@xmath34  emission line were also varied simultaneously to find the set of all of these values which minimises the @xmath51 statistic between observed and computed line profiles and the corresponding best - fitting value of d / h .",
    "minimisation procedure is the spectral resolution .",
    "the nominal value measured from the widths of emission lines from the th - ar lamp used for wavelength calibration is @xmath73 .",
    "however , since the spectrograph slit may be illuminated slightly differently by the lamp and the qso , we preferred to treat the resolution as a free parameter , rather than assuming that it is known perfectly . reassuringly , the value which was found to fit best the shapes of the absorption lines is @xmath74 , as expected . ]",

    "[ fig : dtoh ] , there is a troublesome dispersion between the 11 measurements , well in excess of the quoted errors .",

    "some spectra are of inferior s / n ratio than others , such as that of the @xmath87 dla in q2206@xmath88199 which , because of the lower redshift of this absorber , necessitated observations at ultraviolet wavelengths with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( pettini & bowen 2001 ) .",
    "perhaps most importantly , the efforts devoted to evaluating realistic errors vary considerably between the different analyses collected in table  [ tab : dtoh ] , and we suspect that in at least some cases the errors quoted may well be underestimates , and the values reported may suffer from biases that are unaccounted for .",

    ", we have estimated the mean @xmath89 using the bootstrap method .",
    "that is , we calculated the weighted mean of the 11 measurements in table  [ tab : dtoh ] adopting the errors quoted in the original reports , and repeated the calculation 10000 times by random sampling ( with substitution ) of the 11 values of ( d / h)@xmath4 .",
