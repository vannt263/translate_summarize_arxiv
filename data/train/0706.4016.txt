    "the main ideia of this work is to make a comparation between the @xmath0 and @xmath3 ( 1s+2s+3s ) production in p+p and cu+cu .",
    "these heavy quarkonia states are measured in star through the @xmath5 decay channel . from lattice",
    "qcd calculations@xcite it is expected a suppression of these states in heavy ion collisions due to the sequential melting of their excited states",
    "the experimental setup for this measurement relies in basically three subsystems of the star experiment,@xcite which are the time projection chamber ( tpc ) , barrel electromagnetic calorimeter ( bemc ) and central trigger barrel ( ctb ) , this last one only for triggering @xmath0 events in p+p .",
    "all of these subsystems have full azimuthal coverage .",
    "the tpc has @xmath61.8 and provides up to 45 ionization points to charged tracks within its acceptance , allowing @xmath7 and momentum reconstruction .",
    "the bemc is a lead - scintillator sampling electromagnetic calorimeter with equal volumes of lead and scintillator , divided in 4800 towers within the @xmath61 range , each of them with a face area of @xmath8(0.05,0.05 ) .",
    "the detector resolution on deposited electromagnetic energy is @xmath9 .",
    "tpc was fully installed for both , p+p and cu+cu runs , while the bemc was @xmath103/4 installed for cu+cu and fully installed for p+p .",
    "the ctb is a barrel made if scintilator slats that are sensitive to charged particles only .",
    "as the heavy quarkonia states have really low cross - sections and their decay channel observed in star has a also relatively low branching ratio , the measurements have to improve its statistics relying in either , a large minimum bias data set ( mbt ) , which was the case for cu+cu , or in special dedicated triggers as in p+p wihich are ndetailed in the following section .",
    "the star quarkonia trigger is a two level trigger system designed to optimize the star measurement capabilities of the di - electron decay channel for the heavy quarkonia states .",
    "the following sub - sections details the trigger for j@xmath2 , while the @xmath3 trigger system is detailed in reference.@xcite for the cu+cu run there were not specific quarkonia triggers , and the measurements rely on large mb ( @xmath1040 m events for @xmath0 ) and a high tower trigger ( htt ) ( @xmath109 m events for @xmath3 ) data sets .",
    "this htt trigger have similar effect as the l0-@xmath3 trigger.@xcite the l0-@xmath0 trigger is a topological trigger where the decision is make at the hardware level .",
    "it divides the bemc into 6 sectors in @xmath11 and 2 in @xmath12 , called patches .",
    "there are required at least 2 bemc towers in non - adjacent patches , with energy above the threshold of 1.2 gev ( high - towers , or ht ) . with all these requirements",
    "fulfilled the l2-@xmath0 is started .",
    "the l2 is a software level decision .",
    "it is basically the same algorithm described in [ 6 ] , but with the extra requirement that the ht that seeds the l2 must match a ctb slat adc@xmath133 in order to avoid photons .",
    "the remaining difference is the value of the invariant mass parameter , according to the specific quarkonium state .",
    "the electron identification@xcite is a central issue in the star quarkonium program once its measurements come from the @xmath5 decay channel .",
    "the problem is to separate electrons from hadron contamination , dominated mainly by pions .",
    "the electron identification procedure for quarkonia analysis is basically to choose tpc tracks with momentum @xmath141 gev / c and 3@xmath154.6 .",
    "after this first selection the track is extrapolated to its correspondent bemc tower , its energy @xmath16 is obtained and the ratio @xmath17 is computed . those with @xmath182 are selected as electrons(positrons ) .",
    "once the electrons ( positrons ) are selected they are put together in pairs and have their invariant mass calculated by the expression @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the momentum of the @xmath21th particle and @xmath22 is the angle between them . to estimate the background a mass spectrum is built up from the geometric mean between the positvely charged pairs with the negatively charged ones multiplied by 2 . the net signals ( unlike signed pairs @xmath23 like signed ) are presented in figure 1 .",
    "from there it is possible to see the enhancement of the signals due to the trigger system by comparing the different significances for p+p and cu+cu . in the @xmath0 case it increases from @xmath102.5 in cu+cu to @xmath105.0 in p+p , and for @xmath3 from @xmath102.6 in cu+cu to 3.0@xmath24 in p+p .",
    "the p+p @xmath3 measurement cross section calculated is @xmath2591@xmath2628@xmath2722@xmath28 pb ( br accounts for branching of 1s+2s+3s states ) .",
    "this result agrees very well with pqcd - cem calculations@xcite presented in figure 2 . for the other quarkonium states further analysis",
    "are needed before we can quote their cross sections .",
    "( left ) and @xmath3 and in bottom line same sequence for cu+cu data . two important remarks on this plot : ( a)@xmath0 data in p+p follows more closely the simulated line shape , indicating that a gaussian fit is a poor approximation and ( b ) the @xmath3 signal in cu+cu is on the limit of statistical significance to extract a cross section.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]     cross section in star compared with theoretical values ( pqcd - cem calculation@xcite ) and world data.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]",
    "the heavy - quarkonia program in star will strongly benefit from the future upgrades of rhic and star .",
    "the major impact upgrades are the luminosity enhancement ( @xmath1040@xmath29 ) on the rhic side and , from the star side a barrel time - of - flight detector ( improves low @xmath30 pid ) , a barrel muon detector providing @xmath31 measurements and the daq1000 allowing zero dead time in special triggers for rare probes .",
