    "the powerful jet and double - lobed character of radio emission around distant massive elliptical galaxies is well known and originates in the active galactic nuclei ( agns ) of their host galaxies . indeed , since it is believed that the formation of a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) is closely connected to the formation of the bulge mass , with both evolving together @xcite , one would expect agn - related activity to manifest itself in spirals as well . yet , spiral galaxies do not generally show such impressive evidence for nuclear activity and observations of agns in spirals are relatively rare .",
    "the incidence of radio agn in late type galaxies , for instance , is about an order of magnitude lower than in early - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "those spiral galaxies that do display nuclear outflows in the form of agn - related jet and/or lobe - like features make for a short list .",
    "for example , seyfert galaxies can harbour jets on pc to kpc scales ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "well - known examples also include ngc  3079 @xcite , the circinus spiral galaxy @xcite , ngc  7479 @xcite , ngc  4388 @xcite , ngc  4258 @xcite , as well as the spectacular examples , 0313 - 192 @xcite , ` speca ' @xcite , j23450449 @xcite , and j1649 + 2635 @xcite .",
    "the reason for the apparent relative scarcity of such activity in spirals is not entirely clear , though a variety of possibilities have been raised .",
    "for example , advection - dominated accretion flow may result in very little radiation @xcite , the smbhs in spirals may not be massive enough to produce the large - scale jets seen in ellipticals @xcite , accreting smbhs in spirals may not be spinning rapidly enough @xcite or the magnetic flux could be insufficient to launch jets @xcite .",
    "other issues such as the effect of the dense surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) on the outflow @xcite , the difficulty in accreting high angular momentum gas , the possibility of episodic outflows @xcite , and environmental effects such as perturbations from nearby galaxies , all have yet to be fully understood and quantified .",
    "an additional complicating issue is that nuclear outflows can also originate from a central starburst ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and both may be occurring in the same galaxy ( e.g. ngc  3079 * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "it has thus been difficult to identify the origin of an observed outflow as being due to star formation ( sf ) , or an agn , or some combination thereof .",
    "an active low - luminosity agn ( llagn ) , for example , could be embedded in a nuclear region with abundant sf activity . since",
    "all spirals host star formation , the issue is really whether or not an agn is also present and how best to identify it .",
    "hard x - ray emission is an indicator of agn activity , provided the luminosity exceeds what is expected from ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( @xmath0 ergs / s ) @xcite .",
    "optical emission line ratios that indicate the presence of a hard ionizing continuum is another @xcite although dust obscuration can be problematic , especially for edge - on galaxies .",
    "the mid - ir pah to continuum ratio has been used as a sf / agn diagnostic for distant galaxies @xcite and other mid - ir line ratios ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have also been shown to be effective .",
    "evidence for an agn , however , is not necessarily evidence for agn - related outflows . as indicated above",
    ", it is in the radio continuum that jets and lobes have historically been detected , since synchrotron emission is a strong component of such outflow .",
    "agn - related outflows have been identified by the presence of linear structures in seyfert galaxies @xcite or by small - scale jets in late - type spirals @xcite , but only in in _ total intensity _ radio continuum @xcite . in order",
    "to be so identified , such emission must dominate any sf - related emission in the vicinity .    in this paper",
    ", we provide a new diagnostic for identifying agn - related outflow via radio polarization , specifically _ bipolar radio features or other evidence for agn - related outflows that are masked in total intensity but are revealed in linear polarization . _ in other words , llagns",
    "may not , in fact , be rare , but require that our observations be targeted at the polarized rather than the total intensity radio emission to be clearly seen .",
    "polarization images are well - suited to uncovering previously hidden agns because of their sensitivity to ordered magnetic fields that are prevalent in the outflows and also because the radio emission is insensitive to dust obscuration . as part of the chang - es program (  continuum halos in nearby galaxies  an evla survey  ,",
    "* ) , we focus on one such galaxy at c - band ( 6 ghz ) , i.e. ngc  2992 , which we take to be a prototype for such activity . this galaxy was previously known to harbour an active nucleus ( sect .",
    "[ sec : n2992 ] ) but now the polarized radio emission clearly shows the outflows .    note",
    "that ngc  2992 is _ not _ the only agn in the chang - es sample .",
    "a more complete census of agns in the chang - es sample will be presented in a future paper . for a list of radio polarization observations and magnetic fields that have been observed in other mostly non - edge - on nearby galaxies ,",
    "see the appendices of @xcite .",
    "ngc  2992 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : n2992_totalintensity_dss ] , d = 34 mpc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is a well - known seyfert galaxy @xcite that is interacting with its primary companion , ngc  2993 , @xmath1 arcmin to the se as well as arp  245n @xmath2 arcmin to the ne ( see also fig .  [",

    "@xcite have shown that an additional smaller galaxy , fgc  0938 , @xmath3 arcmin to the sw is also part of this system , collectively known as arp  245 .",
    "the result is that ngc  2992 is highly disturbed .",
    "for example , duc et al .",
    "list the galaxy s inclination at 70 degrees .",
    "however , in the central @xmath4 1 arcmin where we detect continuum emission , optical isophotes suggest an inclination of 64 degrees assuming a thin disk .",

    "a variety of evidence has already pointed to nuclear activity in this galaxy .",

    "higher resolution radio continuum observations by @xcite and @xcite show emission within the central 10 arcsec of the galaxy in the form of a double loop that is limb - brightened and centered on the nucleus .",

    "evidence for nuclear radial outflows have also been found in optical emission lines @xcite ; detailed analyses of optical emission lines can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "its seyfert classification has changed with time between 1.5 and 2 within a few years @xcite .",
    "the optical outflows have been attributed predominantly to the agn rather than a nuclear starburst @xcite .",
    "ngc  2992 has long been known to be an x - ray source and the x - ray emission varies @xcite ( flares ) on timescales of days to weeks @xcite .",
    "the companion galaxy , ngc  2993 , is also an x - ray source @xcite .",
    "an infrared outburst was detected in 1988 @xcite .",
    "@xcite conclude that the extra - nuclear soft x - ray luminosity could be explained either by a star - burst - driven or agn - driven wind .    in summary",
    ", there is compelling prior evidence for an agn in ngc  2992 . in total intensity radio emission ,",
    "however , only the eastern extension and inner double - loop ( within our central oval ) have previously indicated that agn - related outflow has occurred .",
    "our chang - es data include both c - band ( 6 ghz ) and l - band ( 1.6 ghz ) observations using the karl g. jansky very large array ( hereafter the vla ) in a variety of array configurations . here , we report on the c - band observations only , since no linear polarization is observed at l - band with a fractional polarization ( p / i ) that is above @xmath7 in either array configuration ; this is likely due to faraday depolarization at the lower frequency .",
    "the c - band observations were obtained in the c and d configurations of the vla .",
    "the largest spatial scale detectable by the vla at c - band is 4 arcmin ; since the entire field of view shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : n2992_totalintensity_dss ] is only 1.6 arcmin , we should not have missed any significant short - spacing flux .",
    "a summary of the observations and image parameters is given in table  [ table : image_parameters ] .",
    "data reduction and imaging details are described in @xcite and @xcite . here",
    "we provide a brief outline .",
    "the common astronomy software applications ( casa ) package @xcite was used throughout .",
    "each galaxy was observed within a scheduling block that included other galaxies so that the uv coverage could be maximized for each .",
    "the calibrators were 3c  286 which was used for the primary gain and phase calibration as well as the bandpass and polarization angle calibration , j1407 + 2827 ( oq208 ) which was used to calibrate the polarization leakage , and finally the secondary gain and phase calibrators , j0837 - 1951 and j0943 - 0819 for ngc  2992 in d and c configurations , respectively .",
    "the frequency coverage was from 4.979 @xmath8 7.021 ( 2.042 ghz ) and observations were carried out in spectral line mode with 16 spectral windows across the band ( each 128 mhz wide ) .",
    "each spectral window contained 64 spectral channels for a total of 1024 channels across the entire band .",
    "flagging was carried out manually and any flagging that applied to the total intensity data ( rr and ll circular polarizations ) was automatically applied to the cross - polarizations ( rl and lr ) .",
    "additional flagging was then carried out for rl and lr as required .",
    "wide - field imaging @xcite was carried out using the multi - scale multi - frequency synthesis ( ms - mfs ) algorithm @xcite , with simultaneous fitting of a simple power law ( @xmath9 ) across the band .",
    "for all maps from the individual observing runs , briggs robust = 0 uv weighting was used @xcite as implemented in casa .",
    "self - calibration iterations were also carried out for the total intensity image ( table  [ table : image_parameters ] ) until no further improvement in the dynamic range resulted .",
    "imperfect phase and amplitude calibrations produce errors that normally be below the rms for    the dynamic range of the total intensity images are very high ( e.g. @xmath5 8000/1 at c - configuration ) and therefore imperfect phase and amplitude calibrations result in some residual sidelobes that could not be cleaned out completely .",
    "hence we show our first contours at levels that are higher than is normally shown ( fig .",
    "[ fig : n2992_totalintensity_dss ] ) .    for each observation , stokes q and u were imaged using the same self - calibration table and the same input parameters as for total intensity .",
    "maps of linear polarization , @xmath10 were then made , where @xmath11 is the rms noise of the q and u maps .",
    "the latter term does a zeroth order correction for the fact that p images are positively biased ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and is the only correction that is currently implemented in casa . in this correction",
    "some very low level emission becomes negative and those negatives are then blanked .",
    "polarization angle maps were then also made with a 3@xmath11 cut off .",
    "all maps were then corrected for the primary beam ( pb , full - width at half - maximum = 7.5 arcmin ) .",
    "we show our resulting images without the pb correction ( unless otherwise indicated ",
    "see next section ) so that the noise is uniform ; however , any measurements are made on the pb - corrected images , and so throughout .",
    "note that the source is only about 1 arcmin in size so that pb corrections are minor .",
    "we combined the c and d configuration uv data into a single large data set in order to obtain the highest possible signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio with sensitivity to a wide range of spatial scales .",
    "in addition , we carried out an rm synthesis analysis to correct for faraday rotation , as follows .",
    "both the c and d configuration uv data were imaged simultaneously to make two new images of ` low resolution ' and ` high resolution ' which resulted from modifying the briggs robustness parameter and uvtaper ( table  [ table : image_parameters ] ) .",
    "the total intensity images were made in the same way as described in sect .",
    "[ sec : individual_configurations ] except for the different input parameters which are listed in the table .",
    "the original images had marginally smaller beams than quoted in the table and were then smoothed to the resolutions indicated ; this was to ensure that the total intensity and polarized intensity resolutions matched exactly since they are formed using different processes ( see below ) .",
    "attempts were made to do additional self - calibration of the combined configuration data sets ; however such attempts did not improve the dynamic range of the images .",
    "for the linear polarization imaging , we produced combined - configuration q and u cubes with dimensions of ra , dec , and frequency .",
    "for each image plane along the frequency axis , we averaged the data over each spectral window so that we sample the entire band with a new channel separation of 128 mhz .",
    "images for each new channel were then smoothed to the resolution of the spectral window with the lowest resolution and then pb - corrected using the primary beam that corresponds to the center of its channel .",
    "stokes q , u and polarized intensity ( pi ) cubes in dimensions , ra , dec , faraday depth , @xmath12 , were then generated using the rm synthesis code of @xcite .",
    "the faraday depth of a source is defined as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the magnetic field strength in @xmath6 g , @xmath15 is the electron number density in @xmath16 , and r is the line - of - sight path length in pc .",
    "the @xmath12 axis of the cubes extends from -1000 to + 1000 rad m@xmath17 so that @xmath18 is fulfilled ( where we assumed @xmath19 to be the difference in wavelength squared that corresponds to the separation between the two lowest frequency channels ) and hence no significant faraday depolarization between adjacent frequency channels occurs .",
    "the following data products were then extracted from the faraday cubes via an algorithm kindly supplied by b. adebahr ( private communication ) : a ) a pi map , consisting of the maximum value along the @xmath12 axis of the pi cube for each pixel , b ) a map of the @xmath12 value at which the maximum pi occurs , c ) a map of apparent polarization position angles corresponding to the @xmath12 value at which the maximum pi occurs , and d ) a map of de - rotated ( corrected ) polarization position angle which also corresponds to the location at which pi is maximum .",
    "maps that show @xmath12 at the highest polarized flux density in the faraday depth spectra , and of the intrinsic polarization angle for this @xmath12 , were computed only in regions where the polarized intensity is higher than 4@xmath20 in the faraday q and u image planes .",
    "the width of the @xmath21 distribution probed in c - band leads to a rm spread function with a main peak fwhm of  2000 rad m@xmath17 , which implies that potentially present emission at multiple faraday depths is not resolved .",
    "we therefore assume for our further analysis that emission on any given line of sight appears at a single faraday depth .",
    "while it would hence be possible to measure faraday depths at a similar accuracy by computing classical rms between different sections of the frequency band ( the @xmath22 ambiguity is not a major issue at c - band ) , our main purpose of applying rm synthesis instead is to improve our sensitivity to the polarized emission .",
    "moreover , due to the poor resolution in faraday depth , a deconvolution of the faraday spectra was not necessary .",
    "since maps made as a result of rm synthesis must necessarily be corrected for the pb at a prior stage , any combined - configuration polarization images are shown with pb correction .",
    "rms noise values are then a function of position on the map and we quote averages in table  [ table : image_parameters ] in these cases .",

    "in addition , we wish to see the extent to which faraday - rotation may or may not alter the magnetic field vectors for this disturbed edge - on galaxy at c - band .",

    "the inner contours ( c - configuration ) also show emission extending away from the central oval .",
    "the ` west extension ' is particularly noteworthy ( see below ) .",
    "the total flux density at 6.0 ghz is 80.4 @xmath23 1.6 mjy @xcite and the global spectral index between l - band ( 1.6 ghz ) and c - band ( 6 ghz ) is @xmath24 @xcite .",

    "4a ) , i.e. ngc  2992 has a global spectral index that is suggestive of an agn , in agreement with previous knowledge about this galaxy .",
    "the _ in - band _ spectral index ( see * ? ? ? * for a full description ) of the highest resolution ( @xmath4 3.3 arcsec = 540 pc ) c - configuration data within the half - power - beam - width centered at the nucleus is @xmath26 .",
    "these values clearly indicate that non - thermal emission is dominant at c - band .",
    "the linear polarization images ( fig .  [ fig : n2992_polarization ] ) are quite revealing . the d - configuration c - band image ( top )",
    "shows apparent magnetic field ( b ) vectors in coherent structures , pointing roughly away from the galaxy s center . _",
    "these vectors have not yet been corrected for internal faraday rotation ( see next section)_. because the linear polarization becomes less reliable when the fractional polarization , @xmath27 , falls below 0.5% ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we show the 0.5% fractional polarization contour in blue .",
    "interior to that contour , the total intensity emission is very high so the fractional polarization is low and the results in that central region are unreliable . outside of the blue contour where the polarization is reliable , systematic behaviour is seen over size scales of @xmath5 10 arcsec ( 1.6 kpc ) from the nucleus .",
    "there is emission to the east , west and north of the nucleus which are labelled in the figure .",

    "the lower image shows the high resolution c - configuration map .",
    "again , inside the blue contour , the polarization becomes unreliable .",
    "thus , the two peaks closest to the galaxy s center ( 4 arcsec nw and se of center ) are not believable features .",
    "the most obvious reliable feature is the emission in the boxed region to the west of the nucleus with the appearance of a radio lobe , labelled west",
    "lobe. this west lobe corresponds to the west peak labelled in the top image .",
    "the lobe broadens somewhat at its west end .",
    "the north and east peaks , labelled in both images , are much less obvious in the high resolution ( bottom ) map . to compare",

    "[ sec : interpretation ] ) .",
    "the key results of this paper are that linearly polarized emission has revealed a double - lobed radio source along the minor axis ( east - west ) direction of ngc  2992 that is masked in total intensity emission , and that the western lobe is seen as a very discrete radio lobe at high resolution .",
    "clearly , these polarized structures have been masked by the stronger unpolarized emission .",
    "there are two other good examples in the chang - es sample of known agns with distinct radio lobes for which lobes are much more obvious in polarization than in total intensity , namely ngc  3079 @xcite and ngc  4388 @xcite .",
    "we show the previously unpublished total intensity and polarized image of ngc  3079 in fig .",
    "[ fig : n3079 ] .",
    "details related to this galaxy will be discussed elsewhere , but this is another example in which the outflow , in particular the radio lobe to the east , is much more obvious in polarization .",
    "the peak total intensity emission ( top image ) occurs at the nucleus rather than in the east lobe .",
    "the brightness ratio of east radio lobe to nucleus ( both measured at their respective peaks ) is only 0.58 .",
    "by contrast , for the linearly polarized emission ( bottom ) , the east radio lobe is brightest , with an east lobe to nucleus ratio of 5.8 .",
    "in other words , the contrast has increased by a factor of 10 .",
    "similar results can be seen in ngc  4388 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in both ngc  3079 and ngc  4388",
    ", the nuclear outflow is strong enough that the radio lobes can also be seen in total intensity , whereas this is not the case for ngc  2992 .",
    "c +   +      the evidence for an agn in ngc  2992 has been outlined in sect .",
    "[ sec : n2992 ] and the case for agn - related outflow has also been made ; for example @xcite indicate that the most likely energy source for the optical outflow is a hot , bipolar , thermal wind powered by the agn and diverted along the galaxy s minor axis by the pressure gradient of the ism . in this section ,",
    "we provide further evidence that the outflow is predominantly agn - related .",
    "firstly , the discrete western radio lobe seen at high resolution in ngc  2992 ( fig .  [ fig : percentpol ] ) has the appearance of most extragalactic radio lobes ( egrls ) seen in distant galaxies , though is small - scale in comparison , extending to 1.6 kpc from the galaxy s center .",
    "it is similar to what has been seen before for seyferts and other galaxies that show radio lobes in total intensity ( sect .",
    "[ sec : introduction ] ) .",
    "outflows are also known to result from nuclear starbursts and sne in starbursts can be more effective at driving galactic - scale winds than agn @xcite in llagns .",
    "such winds are dominated by hot gas , visible in x - ray emission and in h@xmath40 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "however , these winds ( such as are known ) are in conical ouflows .",
    "they also align with the galaxies minor axes , _ even at the smallest scales _",
    "i.e. as soon as the outflow leaves the sf region , because the alignment is a result of the surrounding ism which focusses the outflow and causes it to move in the direction of steepest pressure gradient ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for the starburst - driven wind in ngc  253 , both the total intensity as well as the polarized radio emission are also filamentary and surround the nuclear outflow which is collimated by a helical magnetic field into a wide - angle cone @xcite . in m  82 , the radio emission",
    "is also observed along the outside of the wind @xcite . in general ,",
    "starburst - related winds have opening angles of 10 to 45 deg . near the base increasing to 45 to 100 deg . above the disk @xcite for those systems that are well - known .",
    "the distinct western lobe in ngc  2992 , by contrast , appears more ` lobe - like ' than ` cone - like ' in these observations .",
    "it is also _ mis - aligned _ with the galaxy s center .",
    "[ fig : percentpol ] illustrates this best in which we have shown high resolution 1.4 ghz contours from the inner double - loop @xcite which is in our inner central oval location .",
    "the orientation of the inner double - loop is strongly misaligned with the minor axis and is well - known to represent ejection from the agn .",
    "the western radio lobe then becomes aligned with the minor axis .",
    "these observations suggest that outflow near the nucleus first extends towards the nnw and then it curves towards the west ( the direction of the minor axis ) as expected from ism pressure gradients . on larger scales towards the east and west ( fig .  [",
    "fig : combined_optical ] the alignment is roughly along the minor axis",
    ".    ordered magnetic fields are also typical of aligned outflows from agns . in egrls , magnetic field alignments and their causes are still debated ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , in classic aligned outflow , the radial component of the field would fall off as @xmath41 , since flux is conserved and the radial component declines with increasing cross - sectional area .",
    "a helical field wrapping around the outflow would decline as @xmath42 , that is , as the circumference .",
    "consequently , one would expect b to align parallel to the jet close to the origin , as many such observations show @xcite , but once the circumferential field starts to dominate , b would become perpendicular farther from the origin , as is sometimes , but not always observed @xcite .",
    "alternatively , @xmath14 parallel to the outflow axis may result if the initial fields are sheared to lie in a plane .",
    "strong shocks can compress an initially random field , creating an ordered magnetic field , in which case transverse magnetic field vectors would result in the region of the shocks @xcite .",
    "radio knots are generally interpreted as the termination point of a jet that is stopped in the dense ism where the radio emission is enhanced by compressed material and magnetic fields @xcite .    in the case of the west lobe of ngc  2992 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : combined ] bottom ) , we observe curving magnetic fields .",
    "the curvature appears to follow the direction that the radio lobe , itself , would be bending because of pressure gradients in the ism .",
    "the fields become somewhat more transverse at the west ( terminating ) end , similar to the egrls just described . an increase in percentage polarization towards the end of the lobe ( fig .",
    "[ fig : percentpol ] ) is consistent with this interpretation .    from optical emission lines ,",
    "there is also much evidence for radial flows including cone - like outflow @xcite towards the east and west . our total intensity image ( fig .",
    "[ fig : n2992_totalintensity_dss ] ) as well as our low - resolution polarization images that show magnetic fields pointing radially away from the nucleus ( fig .",
    "[ fig : combined ] top ) agree with this picture that on larger scales , we can see wider outflow .",
    "a detailed comparison of the optical and radio outflows is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , we do note that the distinct west radio lobe is located within the western optical cone in projection . finally ,",
    "@xcite have shown , on energetic grounds , that outflows on scales up to 2 kpc can not have been produced by a starburst and must have originated with the agn .",
    "this is approximately the same spatial scale over which we see the radio lobe .",
    "in summary , the weight of evidence indicates that we are observing embedded weak polarized radio lobes that originate with an agn in ngc  2992 .",
    "it is clear that the radio lobes are interacting with the ism .",
    "on the west side , the lobe has not yet escaped from the galaxy but the east lobe has emerged outside of the disk . the discrete west lobe of ngc  2992 , as discussed above ,",
    "does not align directly with the nucleus ( fig .",
    "[ fig : percentpol ] ) and , if the agn - related outflow has maintained its direction over time , then there has been a significant bend in the outflow direction between 3 and 7 arcsec from the nucleus ( @xmath5 500 - 1200 pc in projection ) .",
    "such bends are also commonly seen in egrls , for a variety of reasons ( e.g. precessing jets , kelvin - helmholtz instabilities , etc . )",
    "but for ngc  2992 , the bend is more likely caused by a deflection due to pressure gradients in the ism as described in early models such as @xcite .",
    "similar bending has been observed before in spiral galaxies , e.g. in ngc  4258 @xcite .",
    "measured and derived properties of the distinct western radio lobe of ngc  2992 are listed in table  [ table : results ] measured within the 3@xmath20 contour as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : percentpol ] ( top ) .",
    "the percentage polarization is significant , i.e. @xmath5 6% .",
    "this value may , however , be underestimated .",
    "this is because we do not observe the radio lobes in total intensity and have simply measured the total intensity over a region that corresponds to the observed polarized radio lobe .",
    "consequently , the total intensity measurement could include any other total intensity emission along the line of sight that is outside of the radio lobe itself , thus increasing @xmath43 in comparison to @xmath44 . as a comparison , in distant egrls ,",
    "values are only a few percent at this frequency ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , possibly because of poorer linear resolution for the more distant sources ( but see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , higher percentages have been seen in other nearby spiral galaxies , for example the similar galaxy , ngc  4388 @xcite .    in table",
    "[ table : results ] , we also provide the minimum energy magnetic field ; this was determined from the total intensity flux density , following @xcite , assuming that the measured spectral index @xmath5 the non - thermal spectral index . if the spectral index steepens by 10% due to a thermal contribution , then @xmath45 increases by + 4% .",
    "if the line of sight distance decreases by a factor of 2 , then @xmath45 will increase by 18@xmath4620% .",
    "the same cautions outlined in the previous paragraph apply here .",
    "the minimum total field value ( table  [ table : results ] ) , if random , suggests a magnetic pressure of @xmath47 erg @xmath16 . by comparison , typical values for galactic disks",
    "are @xmath48 erg @xmath16 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and are about 3 times larger in the central regions .",
    "consequently , the value is high enough that the jet should propagate but not so high that it would nt be affected by the surrounding ism , as the changes in orientation suggest . as further confirmation ,",
    "@xcite indicate that , within the central 5 arcsec , the pressure of the x - ray emitting gas is @xmath49 erg @xmath16 , where @xmath50 is the volume filling factor , and they also indicate that this value is similar to the extended narrow line region clouds .",
    "consequently , pressure calculations from a wide variety of observations are all pointing to values that are within factors of a few , of order several 10@xmath51 erg @xmath16 .    with sufficient data",
    ", it should be possible to make use of such observations to determine ( or place limits on ) the physical conditions in a galaxy , or the energetics of the outflow , or both .",
    "for example , the ` stall ' location of a radio lobe should occur where the lobe pressure equals the ism pressure , and a lobe should emerge from the disk if its pressure exceeds that of the ism ( as for the east lobe of ngc  2992 ) .",
    "the relation between the intrinsic bending angle and jet ram pressure is also known for environments with static atmospheres @xcite . since ngc  2992 has been well - observed at a variety of wavelengths ( sect .",

    "for example , the most recent activity would belong to the total intensity inner double - loop region within our inner oval region ( fig .",
    "[ fig : n2992_totalintensity_dss ] ) and oriented nnw - sse .",
    "we would not see this outflow explicitly in linear polarization because the percentage polarization is below believable levels near the galaxy s center .    at an earlier time",
    ", the higher resolution western radio lobe observed in linear polarization was formed and the observed polarized feature would therefore be a relic of this earlier activity .",
    "pressure gradients in the ism cause this outflow to bend towards the minor axis .",
    "the low resolution eastern and western radios lobe could have occurred at approximately the same time or else they represent lower level continuous flows ( e.g. note that the b vectors do nt curve around the lobes as is sometimes seen in egrls ) . since ngc  2992 is highly disturbed because of the interaction with its companions , the eastern disk could have a different ism pressure gradient , allowing the eastern lobe to escape from the disk as observed .",
    "these features would not be seen in total intensity because the broader scale total intensity emission is much brighter , masking the polarized intensity structure .    finally , the southeast extension ( fig .",
    "[ fig : n2992_totalintensity_dss ] ) would belong to an even earlier episode .",
    "this feature has emerged from the galaxy and is pointing towards the companion galaxy , ngc  2993 .",
    "polarized emission would not be seen from this extended feature because it is just too weak on this larger scale .",
    "since the optical emission appears as a wide - angled cone @xcite with the west radio lobe within it in projection , the discrete radio features may represent specific high - energy ejection eposides in comparison to lower level steady emission .",
    "the latter is more likely explained by an agn - powered thermal wind as described in @xcite .",
    "the polarized emission from ngc  2992 , uniquely provided by the chang - es survey , has offered us a new glimpse into the nuclear activity in this galaxy .",
    "although radio lobes are _ not _ observed in total intensity radio emission , they _ are _ observed in polarized emission .",
    "thus , we are observing weak radio lobes which were not strong enough to be distinguished from other non - polarized emission seen in total intensity .    for ngc  2992 , at high resolution ,",
    "a single discrete radio lobe is observed on the western side of the galaxy s center and at low resolution , two radio lobes are seen on either side of the nucleus , extending to the east and west .",
    "the eastern radio lobe has emerged from the galaxy whereas the western lobe is within the disk .",
    "we argue that the radio lobes are consistent with agn - like outflow .",
    "the orientation of the discrete western radio lobe is consistent with outflow that has been redirected , via pressure - gradients in the ism , along the minor axis . the outflow and ism pressures are consistent with this picture , to within measurable factors of a few ( assuming that the minimum energy criterion holds ) .",
    "we suggest a possible ( though not unique ) evolutionary scenario for the observed radio features such that the variety of radio activity seen in this galaxy can be simply explained by episodic outflow from the agn , possibly embedded within more steady lower level flows .",

    "<S> we report on c - band ( 5 - 7 ghz ) observations of the galaxy , ngc  2992 , from the chang - es sample . </S>",
    "<S> this galaxy displays an embedded nuclear double - lobed radio morphology within its spiral disk , as revealed in linearly polarized emission but _ not _ in total intensity emission . </S>",
    "<S> the radio lobes are kpc - sized , similar to what has been observed in the past for other seyfert galaxies , and show ordered magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> ngc  2992 has shown previous evidence for agn - related activity , but not the linearly polarized radio features that we present here . </S>",
    "<S> we draw attention to this galaxy as the first clear example ( and prototype ) of bipolar radio outflow that is revealed in linearly polarized emission only . such polarization observations , which are unobscured by dust , provide a new tool for uncovering hidden weak agn activity which may otherwise be masked by brighter unpolarized emission within which it is embedded . </S>",
    "<S> the radio lobes observed in ngc  2992 are interacting with the surrounding interstellar medium and offer new opportunities to investigate the interactions between nuclear outflows and the ism in nearby galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we also compare the radio emission with a new chandra x - ray image of this galaxy . a new chang - es image of ngc  3079 is also briefly shown as another example as to how much more obvious radio lobes appear in linear polarization as opposed to total intensity . </S>"
