    "a tv broadcast speech database named kalaka-2 @xcite is employed for analysing language - dependent speech .",
    "it was originally designed for language recognition evaluation purposes and consists of wide - band tv broadcast speech recordings ( roughly 4 hours per language ) featuring 6 different languages : basque , catalan , galician , spanish , portuguese and english .",
    "tv broadcast shows were recorded and sampled using @xmath7 bytes at @xmath8 samples / second rate , taking care of including as much diversity as possible regarding speakers and speech modalities .",
    "it includes both planned and spontaneous speech throughout diverse environment conditions , such as studio or outside journalist reports but excluding telephonic channel .",
    "therefore audio excerpts may contain voices from several speakers but only a single language .",
    "for illustrative purposes in figure [ presentacion ] we depict a sample speech waveform amplitude @xmath9 and its squared , semi - definite positive instantaneous energy @xmath2 , respectively . without loss of generality , dropping the irrelevant constants , @xmath10 has units of energy per time .",
    "then , a threshold @xmath3 is defined as the instantaneous energy level for which a fixed percentage of data is larger than the threshold . for instance , @xmath11 is the threshold for which @xmath12 of the data fall under this energy level ( this allows to compare data across different empirical signals @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath3 not only works as a threshold of ` zero energy ' that filters out background ( environmental ) noise , but help us to unambiguously distinguish a speech event , defined as a sequence of _ consecutive _ measurements @xmath4 , from a silence event , whose duration is @xmath1 ( see figure [ presentacion ] ) .",
    "accordingly , speech can now be seen as a dynamical process of energy releases or ` speech earthquakes ' separated by silence events , with in principle different statistical properties given different thresholds @xmath3 . in what follows we address all these properties . + * energy release : a gutenberg - richter - like scaling law in speech * + the energy of a speech event is computed from the integration of the instantaneous energy over the duration of that event @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the inverse of the sampling frequency ( and therefore @xmath5 has arbitrary units of energy ) . in order to get rid of environmental noise , we set a fixed threshold @xmath15 and for each language , we compute its histogram @xmath16 . in figure [ energy ]",
    "we draw , in log - log scales , this histogram for all languages considered ( note that a logarithmic binning was used to smooth out the data ) .",
    "we find out a robust power - law scaling @xmath17 over five decades saturated by the standard finite - size cutoff , where the fitted exponents are all consistent with a language - independent universal behaviour : @xmath18 for spanish , @xmath19 for basque , @xmath20 for portuguese , @xmath21 for galician , @xmath22 for catalan , and @xmath23 for english , all having a correlation coefficient @xmath24 ( for completeness , in the inset of figure [ energy ] we also depict the binned histogram of instantaneous energy @xmath25 for all languages ) . as long as the magnitude in seismicity @xcite is related to the logarithm of the energy release , under this definition @xmath16 can be identified as a new gutenberg - richter - like law in speech .",
    "this may be seen as related to other scaling laws in cognitive sciences @xcite , although at this stage it is still unclear what particular contributions come from both the mechanical ( vocal folds and resonating cavity ) and the cognitive systems .",
    "+     released in the statistics of all languages considered in this study , after a logarithmic binning .",
    "the figure shows a power law @xmath17 , that holds for five decades , truncated for large ( rare ) events by a finite - size cut - off .",
    "( inset panel ) log - log plot of the associated instantaneous energy histogram @xmath25 of each language , which we include for completeness .",
    "we note that this non scaling shape of instantaneous energy is similar to the one found for precipitation rates @xcite.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]         * scaling and universality of waiting time distributions . *",
    "+ in a second part , we study on the temporal orchestration of fluctuations , that is , the arrangement of silences or speech interevents of duration @xmath1",
    ". we will pay a special attention to the intraphoneme range ( timescales @xmath26 s @xcite ) , where we assume no cognitive effects are present , in order to focus on the physiological aspects of speech . at this point",
    "we introduce a renormalisation group ( rg ) transformation to explore the origin of temporal correlations .",
    "this technique originates in the statistical physics community and has been previously used in the context of earthquakes @xcite and tropical - cyclone statistics @xcite .",
    "the first part of the transformation consists of a decimation : we raise the threshold @xmath3 .",
    "this in general leads to different interevent distributions @xmath27 .",
    "the second part of the transformation consists in a scale transformation in time , such that renormalized systems become comparable : @xmath28 , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the mean interevent time of the system for a particular @xmath3 .",
    "invariant distributions under this rg transformation collapse into a threshold - independent universal curve : an adimensional waiting time distribution .",
    "while the complete fixed point structure of this rg is not well understood yet , recent advances @xcite rigorously found that stable ( attractive ) fixed points include the exponential distribution and a somewhat exotic double power - law distribution , which are attractors for both memoryless and short - range correlated stochastic point processes under the rg flow .",
    "invariant distributions other than the previous fixed points are likely to be unstable solutions of the rg flow , therefore encompassing criticality in the underlying dynamics @xcite .",
    "+ in the left panel of figure [ interevent ] we plot in log - log , for different thresholds , the interevent histogram @xmath27 associated to the english language . in the intraphoneme range , interevents are power - law distributed in every case @xmath31 . in the right panel of the same figure we plot the rescaled histograms @xmath32 ( @xmath33 for every language , yielding a total of 18 curves ) , collapsing under a single curve .",
    "note that the collapse is quite good for those timescales that belong to the intraphoneme range , where only physiological mechanisms are in place , and such collapse is lost for larger timescales .",
    "this suggests that for every language , the statistics are invariant under this rg transformation , and the pattern is robust across languages .",
    "a more careful statistical analysis is required here as the range of the power law , restricted to the intraphoneme regime , is smaller . accordingly , exponent @xmath34 is estimated now following clauset et al.s method @xcite which employs maximum likelihood estimation ( mle ) of a power law model , where goodness - of - fit test and confidence interval are based on kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) tests ( comparing the actual distribution with 100 synthetic power law models whose exponent is the one found in the mle to obtain p - values ) .",
    "this method yields a fairly universal exponent @xmath35 within the @xmath36 confidence interval @xmath37 $ ] , ks p - value of @xmath38 and the statistical support for the power - law hypothesis given by a p - value of @xmath39 .",
    "it is well known that the dynamics of speech generation are complex , nonlinear , and certainly poorly explained by the benchmark source - filter theory . the fact that a gutenberg - richter law for the energy release probability distribution during speech emerges opens the possibility of understanding speech production in terms of crackling noise , a highly nonlinear behaviour that was first described in condensed matter physics @xcite and latter found in a variety of natural hazards systems including earthquakes @xcite , rain @xcite or solar flares @xcite to cite some @xcite .",
    "the underlying theory might then describe energy releases as the resonating response function of the system under airflow perturbation ( the so called susceptibility in the statistical physics jargon ) , and the fact that it is a power law distributed quantity is the first evidence of criticality in these systems .",
    "+ the fact that the waiting time distributions are different from the well known stable exponential laws while being invariant under the rg transformation confirms that the system is indeed operating close to a critical point .",
    "note that the currently established low dimensional chaotic hypothesis suffers from being a process with short - range correlations and therefore chaotic speech interevents should typically renormalise into the exponential law .",
    "the most plausible conclusion of this work is that the physiological process of speech production evidences long - range correlations and criticality .",
    "this argument can be put in the same grounds as equilibrium critical phenomena , where only long - range correlations allow the system to escape from the basin of attraction of the trivial rg ( high or low temperature ) fixed points .",
    "as long as the critical solution is an _ unstable _ fixed point of the rg flow , the fact that the underlying dynamics seems to be poised near this point is somewhat remarkable .",
    "if we assume that the dynamics of speech generation at the level of the vocal folds are influenced by the properties of the glottal airflow , then our results would suggest that a similar critical behaviour might take place in other physiological processes involving such airflow , something that has been found empirically in the mechanism of lung inflation @xcite .",
    "+ note also that whereas a simple stochastic processes such as a brownian motion can not explain these results , under the more general paradigm of fractional brownian motion with first return distribution @xmath40 , our findings would be consistent with so called @xmath41 noise ( with hurst exponent @xmath42 ) , on agreement with previous evidence @xcite , this latter being a trait of long range correlations .",
    "this gives further credit to our results , as @xmath41 noise is usually found along with criticality @xcite .",
    "+ although we acknowledge that weakly chaotic systems such as intermittent ones can operate close to criticality , our results suggest that the paradigm of self - organised criticality ( soc ) @xcite - out of equilibrium dissipative systems that self - organise towards a critical state- may be a more adequate modelling scenario than standard low dimensional chaos . if this was to be the case , threshold dynamics @xcite would appear as the essential ingredient that encompasses the nonlinear properties in speech .",
    "these new approaches could further contribute to the development of both ( i ) microscopic ( generative ) models of speech production , and ( ii ) alternative methods of speech synthesis that would profit from the self - similar properties of speech at the intraphoneme range to make refined speech interpolation without needs to incorporate in the synthesis model pieces of real speech .",
    "+ furthermore , the combined fact that ( i ) the results are robust for different human languages and that ( ii ) the timescales involved in this analysis require that the process is purely physiological , lead us to conclude that this mechanism is a universal trait of human beings .",
    "it is an open question if the onset of soc in this system is the result of an evolutionary process @xcite , where human speech waveforms would have evolved to be independent of speaker and receiver distance and perception thresholds . in this context",
    ", further work should be done to investigate whether if similar patterns originate in the communication of other species , and up to which extent other variables , such as ageing , may play a role . +",

    "<S> classical speech synthesis technologies and algorithms were firstly based on linear stochastic models and linear prediction @xcite , and their underlying theory , so called source - filter theory of speech production , was initially relying on several key assumptions including uncoupled vocal tract and speech source , laminar airflow propagating linearly , periodic fold vibration , and homogeneous tract conditions @xcite . despite the successes of this benchmark theory , the synthetic speech generated by linear models fails to be ` natural ' . as a matter of fact , current speech synthesizers usually require to incorporate pieces of real speech , e.g. concatenation of smaller speech units ( phoneme and diphone - based synthesis @xcite ) to improve their synthetic output . </S>",
    "<S> + with the popularisation of nonlinear dynamics , fractals , and chaos theory , the modelling paradigm slightly shifted and nonlinear speech processing emerged @xcite . accordingly , a number of authors pointed towards low dimensional , chaotic phenomena as the underlying mechanism governing the fluctuations in speech . </S>",

    "<S> nevertheless , the empirical justification for low dimensional chaos is , up to a certain extent , based on preliminary evidence @xcite , and this modelling approach only theoretically justified through an analogy between turbulent states , chaos , and fractals @xcite . as a matter of fact , it has been recently acknowledged in the nonlinear dynamics community that a word of caution should be taken when empirically analysing the low dimensional nature of short , noisy and nonstationary empirical signals , as not only the computation of dynamical invariants such as fractal dimensions or lyapunov exponents is difficult in those cases @xcite , but furthermore correlated stochastic noise can be misleadingly described as to have a low dimensional attractor @xcite . </S>",
