    "[ sec : intro ]    aim of this paper is to present the godunov method for approximating the solutions to the @xmath0phase traffic model , introduced in  @xcite by colombo , marcellini , and rascle .",
    "the model consists on the system of conservation laws @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the car density at time @xmath3 and at position @xmath4 , @xmath5 is a generalized momentum , @xmath6 is the avarage speed of cars , @xmath7 is a positive constant describing the maximum speed of cars , and @xmath8 is a given decreasing function .",
    "this model is an extension of the famous lighthill - whitham - richards ( lwr ) model , see  @xcite , and it is obtained by assuming that different kinds of drivers have different maximal speeds @xmath9 , where @xmath10 $ ] , for suitable constants @xmath11 .",
    "the model described by  ( [ eq : modeleta ] ) belongs to the class of hyperbolic phase transition models for traffic , whose aim is to describe the different traffic regimes ; see  @xcite .",
    "the pioneer work in this class is the model proposed in 2002 by colombo ; see  @xcite .",
    "its distinctive feature is that the two phases are disconnected .",
    "subsequently other phase transition models have been introduced in the literature ; see  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the models in  @xcite , although very similar in the fundamental diagram , are indeed different , since solutions to riemann problems have different structures and contain a different number of waves . also the derivation of the two models is completely different : the construction in  @xcite is done imposing a priori two phases , the free and the congested one , while in  @xcite the two phases are obtained as a consequence of the speed limit @xmath7 .    in the present paper , we describe the godunov numerical scheme for system  ( [ eq : modeleta ] ) .",
    "the godunov method is a finite volume method for conservation laws ; it is based on the solution to the riemann problem in order to approximate the flux between two contiguous cells ; see  @xcite . in our setting , the fundamental diagram in the conserved variable is convex ; hence the application of this method is straightforward . instead the nonconvexity of the fundamental diagram for the model in  @xcite is a source of various problems for the godunov method ; see  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follow . in section  [ sec : des ] we describe the 2-phase traffic model  ( [ eq : modeleta ] ) . in section  [ sec : comparison ] we make a comparison between the @xmath0phase model  ( [ eq : modeleta ] ) and that in  @xcite . finally in section  [ sec : godunov ] , we describe the godunov method to the model  ( [ eq : modeleta ] ) .",
    "some numerical integrations conclude the paper .",
    "[ sec : des ]    in this section we fix notations and we recall some properties concerning the @xmath0phase traffic model introduced in  @xcite . as already said , the model  ( [ eq : modeleta ] ) is an extension of the classical lwr model , given by the following scalar conservation law @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the traffic density and @xmath14 is the speed .",
    "we consider the folllowing two assumptions on the speed :    * we assume that , at a given density , different drivers may choose different velocities , that is , we assume that @xmath15 , where @xmath8 is a @xmath16 function and @xmath17 is the maximal speed of a driver , located at position @xmath18 at time @xmath19 . *",
    "we impose an overall bound on the speed @xmath7 .",
    "we get the following @xmath20 system @xmath21 and then the model in  ( [ eq : modeleta ] ) , with the change of variables @xmath22 .    as a consequence of the introduction of the speed bound @xmath7 , system  ( [ eq : modeleta ] ) produces two phases , the free and the congested one , described by the sets @xmath23 \\times [ \\check w , \\hat w ]      \\colon v(\\rho , \\rho w ) = { v_{\\max}}\\right\\ } ,    \\\\    \\label{eq : phc }    c    & = &    \\left\\ {      ( \\rho , w ) \\in [ 0,r ] \\times [ \\check w , \\hat w ]      \\colon v(\\rho , \\rho w ) = w \\ , \\psi(\\rho )    \\right\\}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in figure  [ fig : phases ] it is represented the fundalmental digram in the coordinates @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
