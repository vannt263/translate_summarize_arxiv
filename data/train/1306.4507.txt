    "a basic problem in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics is the following @xcite : take a microscopic statistical mechanics model at sufficiently low temperature so that there are , say , two pure thermodynamics phases .",
    "assume that such system evolves according to a microscopic dynamics defined via local evolution rules .",
    "then , the goal is to derive macroscopic , deterministic equations which describes , on large space - time scales , the evolution of spatial boundaries separating the two coexisting thermodynamic phases . an example to keep in mind is the nearest - neighbor ising model on @xmath11 , @xmath12 . below the critical temperature , in the absence of an external magnetic field",
    ", there are two translation invariant equilibrium gibbs measures ( the `` @xmath13 '' and the `` @xmath10 '' thermodynamic phase ) .",
    "one can then easily define a markov dynamics , the so - called glauber dynamics , where individual spins are flipped with rates chosen so that the gibbs measures are invariant and reversible . if at time zero a region of the space is occupied by the `` @xmath13 '' phase and the rest by the `` @xmath10 '' phase , we are interested in how the shape of these region will evolve with time .",
    "if the dynamics does not conserve the order parameter ( e.g. the total magnetization for the ising model ) , it is well understood phenomenologically @xcite that a droplet of one phase immersed in the opposite phase will shrink in order to decrease its surface tension until it disappears in finite time ; also ( roughly speaking ) the normal velocity at a point of its boundary will be proportional to the local mean curvature .",
    "based on this idea , one expects ( `` lifschitz law '' ) that , if the initial droplet has diameter @xmath14 , it will `` evaporate '' within a time of order @xmath8 ( as would be the case for a sphere evolving via mean curvature motion ) .",
    "moreover , the droplet evolution should become deterministic and follow some version of a mean curvature flow in the `` diffusive limit '' where @xmath9 , space is rescaled by @xmath14 ( the initial droplet is then of size @xmath15 ) and time is accelerated by @xmath8",
    ". the resulting large - scale deterministic evolution equation will in general be anisotropic ( i.e. the normal velocity will depend also on the local orientation of the droplet boundary ) when the microscopic model is defined on a lattice , as it is for the ising model .",
    "the main difficulty in implementing this program is that there is no obvious way how to separate the `` fast modes '' related to relaxation inside the bulk of the pure phases from the `` slow modes '' , responsible for the @xmath8 time scaling , related to the interface motion .",
    "such problem is absent in so - called `` effective interface models '' of ginzburg - landau @xmath16 type : for these models , under an assumption of strict convexity of the interaction , funaki and spohn @xcite derived the full mean - curvature motion in the diffusive scaling .",
    "another case @xcite where mean - curvature motion is known to appear in the scaling limit are spin models with kac - type interactions ( the interaction range tends to infinity with the droplet size ) : in this case , however , the system is close to mean - field , the deterministic flow is isotropic and there is no sharp interface separating the phases .",
    "results are much more incomplete for genuine lattice models : for instance , for the two - dimensional ising model at low but non - zero temperature @xmath17 , it is only known that a droplet of `` @xmath10 phase '' immersed in the `` @xmath13 phase '' will disappear in a time of order at most @xmath18 @xcite , to be compared with the expected @xmath8 scaling .    in the present work ,",
    "we study the two - dimensional nearest - neighbor ising model on the square lattice , at zero temperature . each spin variable @xmath19 is updated on average once per time unit : after the update , the spin takes the same sign as the majority of its @xmath20 neighbors , or the value @xmath21 with equal probabilities in case of a tie .",
    "assume that the initial `` @xmath10 '' droplet , when the lattice spacing tends to zero , converges to a smooth enough domain @xmath0 of @xmath1 .",
    "then , in the diffusive scaling limit the droplet boundary is expected to be given by a deterministic evolving curve @xmath22 .",
    "such curve should move according to the following `` ( anisotropic ) curve - shortening flow '' : the normal velocity equals the local ( signed ) curvature , times a function @xmath23 with @xmath24 the local tangent .",
    "the function @xmath25 is explicitly given , cf . .",
    "this result was conjectured in @xcite by spohn , who gave some very reasonable supporting arguments , based on the local analysis of the dropled boundary evolution in terms of interacting particle systems . in @xcite ,",
    "cerf and louhichi computed the `` drift at time @xmath26 '' of the droplet ( for the non - modified dynamics ) , but their result does not allow to get any information on the evolution for positive time @xmath27 . the full convergence to the curve shortening flow for initial _ convex _",
    "droplets @xmath0 was recently obtained in @xcite .",
    "the main result of the present work , theorem [ mainres ] , is a proof of spohn s conjecture , for smooth enough initial droplets @xmath0 , without any convexity assumption .",
    "smoothness of the initial condition is required essentially so that the limit flow is unambiguously defined .    as it was the case",
    "also in @xcite for the convex initial condition , a preliminary but essential step before proving convergence of the stochastic evolution to the limit deterministic one is to show that the anisotropic curve - shortening flow does admit a global ( in time ) solution , and that it does not develop singularities before it shrinks to a point . for the isotropic case ( @xmath28 )",
    "this was proven by grayson in a celebrated work @xcite . in the anisotropic case ,",
    "grayson s result has been extended ( e.g. @xcite ) under the assumption that @xmath25 is at least @xmath29 .",
    "the reason is very simple : the first step in the procedure is to write down the evolution equation satisfied by the curvature of @xmath22 , and in such equation a second derivative of @xmath25 appears . in our case ,",
    "the anisotropy function @xmath25 is not even @xmath30 ( which reflects singularities of the zero - temperature surface tension of the ising model ) . to prove existence , uniqueness and regularity of the ( classical ) solutions of the curve - shortening flow ( cf .",
    "theorem [ th : existence ] ) , we first regularize the function @xmath25 and then analyze the regularized equation following the ideas of @xcite .",
    "of course , it is crucial to check that all the estimates we need are uniform in the regularization parameter , which is sent to zero in the end .",
    "let us emphasize that the regularity estimates of @xcite are far from being quantitative in terms of the smoothness of the anisotropy function @xmath25 .",
    "comparing our present result with that of @xcite , it is important to realize that dropping the convexity assumption is not at all a technical point .",
    "first of all , various monotonicity arguments that were used in @xcite do not work here .",
    "the basic reason is that such ideas crucially relied on the fact that , in the convex case , the normal velocity is always directed inward ( which is clearly false for non - convex droplets , at points where the curvature is negative ) .",
    "secondly , proving existence and regularity of solution requires very different analytic and geometric arguments in the non - convex case with respect to the convex one ( there , we were able to use ideas from @xcite ) . at any rate ,",
    "our previous result @xcite is important in section [ sec : mainres ] , where the evolution of the droplet boundary is controlled by locally comparing it with that of a suitable convex droplet .",
    "let us mention some recent related works by one of the authors . in @xcite the issue of the evolution of a convex planar `` minus droplet '' in the presence of a positive magnetic field has been investigated . in this case the right time scaling is @xmath14 instead of @xmath8 for a droplet of size @xmath31 and the scaling limit is given by the anisotropic eikonal equation : the drift of the interface loses its dependence on the curvature .",
    "generalizing such a result in higher dimensions is a very challenging problem , see e.g. @xcite for a non - rigorous attempt in this direction . in @xcite , the dynamical evolution of a half - droplet on a substrate that attracts the interface ( a situation that also corresponds to `` dynamical polymer pinning '' ) was studied , and the scaling limit was shown to be the solution of stefan - type equation where the motion of the point of contact between the droplet and the substrate depends on the local curvature .",
    "we close this introduction by mentioning a couple of intriguing open problems .",
    "first of all , one would like to know what are the finite-@xmath14 fluctuations of the droplet boundary around its limit shape @xmath22 , along the evolution .",
    "secondly , it is natural to wonder what happens for the zero - temperature dynamics of the _ three- ( or higher- ) dimensional _ ising model .",
    "recently , a weak version of the lifshitz law was proven for the three - dimensional ising model at zero temperature : the evaporation time of a `` @xmath10 '' droplet is of order @xmath8 , up to multiplicative logarithmic corrections @xcite .",
    "an analogous upper bound was proven in higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "however , it is still not clear ( even at a heuristic level ) what should be the precise macroscopic equation , analogous to , describing the droplet evolution in the diffusive limit .",
    "given @xmath32 we consider the zero - temperature stochastic ising model on @xmath33 ( the square lattice with lattice spacing @xmath4 ) .",
    "the state space is the set @xmath34 of spin configurations @xmath35 with @xmath19 .",
    "the dynamics is a markov process @xmath36 , with @xmath37 .",
    "each spin @xmath38 is updated with unit rate : when the update occurs , @xmath38 takes the value of the majority of its four neighbors , or takes values @xmath39 with equal probabilities if exactly two neighbors are @xmath40 and two neighbors are @xmath41 .",
    "we consider a compact , simply connected subset @xmath42 ^ 2 $ ] whose boundary @xmath43 is a jordan curve of finite length .",
    "the initial condition of the stochastic dynamics will be set to be `` @xmath10 '' inside @xmath44 and `` @xmath13 '' outside : @xmath45 we want to compute the scaling limit of the set of `` @xmath10 '' spins at positive times , when @xmath46 . in order to identify a set of `` @xmath10 '' spins as a subset of @xmath1 ,",
