    "it is now clear that chemical noise can sometimes play a significant role in the functioning of biochemical reaction networks @xcite .",
    "such noise is implicated in the spontaneous flipping of genetic switches @xcite , and has been shown to have an adverse effect on the functioning of a synthetic chemical oscillator @xcite . in some circumstances",
    "it has also been argued that noise can have a beneficial effect , for example in stochastic focusing @xcite .",
    "chemical noise in reaction networks can be characterised by the root mean square ( rms ) deviation of number of molecules from the mean .",
    "noise is important if the rms deviation is a significant fraction of the mean .",
    "this is typically associated with systems where the mean number of molecules is rather small .",
    "such situations are characteristic of gene regulatory networks where the concentrations of regulatory proteins can be small enough for there to be only a few molecules in the cell volume .",
    "for example , for the lac operon in _",
    "e. coli _ , the lac repressor is active at concentrations where there are only 1020 molecules present in the cell volume @xcite .",
    "the mean and the rms deviation are ` point statistics ' , and have frequently been used to characterise the stochastic properties of biochemical reaction networks . in the present paper ,",
    "we focus on the noise power spectra , which are a more refined characterisation of the stochastic properties .",
    "we also focus on linear reaction networks for which the noise power spectra and point statistics can be calculated exactly . in the next section ,",
    "we develop a general theory for computing the noise power spectra in linear reaction networks .",
    "we relegate technical details to the appendix . in the following sections we apply the general theory to increasingly elaborate networks which model basic processes of biochemical interest , such as gene expression and signal detection .",
    "we define a _ linear reaction network _ to be a network of chemical reactions which does not involve bimolecular or higher order reactions .",
    "for such a network , the chemical rate equations can be written as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the number of molecules of species @xmath2 , @xmath3 is a matrix of rate coefficients , and @xmath4 are source terms .",
    "is a set of linear ordinary differential equations , which explains the origin of the phrase ` linear reaction network ' .",
    "appendix [ sec : appkb ] indicates how @xmath3 and @xmath4 are related to the stoichiometry matrix and reaction rates which specify the network .",
    "let @xmath5 be the instaneous number of molecules of species @xmath2 in the system .",
    "define the mean value of @xmath1 in steady state to be @xmath6 , and the mean value out of steady state to be @xmath7 . by taking moments of the chemical master equation ( see appendix ) , one can prove that @xmath8 therefore , the chemical rate equations are _ exact _ for a linear reaction network , provided we work with the mean quantities @xmath7 .",
    "in steady state , the mean values therefore solve @xmath9 this is a system of linear simultaneous equations which can be readily solved .",
    "we now define the deviation away from the steady state mean values to be @xmath10 and introduce the steady - state variance - covariance matrix @xmath11 the diagonal elements of this are the variances @xmath12 the rms deviation mentioned in the introduction is @xmath13 .",
    "it is often the case that @xmath14 and in fact some authors define the ` noise strength ' to be @xmath15 although we will not explicitly use this in the present paper .",
    "this scaling means that the relative rms deviation @xmath16 which indicates that the relative important of noise decreases inversely with the square root of the number of molecules involved .",
    "it is the basic reason why noise is important for systems where the number of molecules is small .",
    "as many authors have noticed @xcite , the variance - covariance matrix at steady state can also be obtained by taking moments of the chemical master equation .",
    "the details are unimportant for our arguments , and are relegated to appendix [ sec : appkb ] . for the remainder of the main text , we assume that the means and variance - covariance matrix have been computed .",
    "we will say that these comprise the _ point statistics _ of the network .",
    "to refine the description of the steady state beyond the point statistics , we introduce the set of correlation functions @xmath17 in steady state , the value chosen for the time origin is unimportant ( therefore the average could be regarded as a time average over starting times , instead of an ensemble average ) .",
    "the correlation functions have the properties @xmath18 c_{ij}(t ) \\to 0\\quad\\text{as}\\quad t\\to\\infty,\\\\[6pt ] c_{ij}(t ) = c_{ji}(-t ) \\end{array}\\ ] ] ( the first of these is not always true ; see section [ sec : fast ] ) .",
    "the last property shows that the autocorrelation functions are time - symmetric , @xmath19 , but it does not follow that the cross - correlation functions are time - symmetric , as is illustrated by the example in section [ sec : gem ] .    closely related to the autocorrelation functions are the noise power spectra , which are the central topic of study in the present paper .",
    "these are defined to be @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the fourier transform of @xmath22 .",
    "we shall use the second form in eq .   to compute the noise power spectra .",
    "usually the noise power spectra obey the sum rule ( for an exception , see section [ sec : fast ] ) , @xmath23    now we turn to the computation of the correlation functions and the noise power spectra . in appendix",
    "[ sec : appc ] we prove that the correlation functions satisfy @xmath24 if we subtract eq .   from eq .  , we find that the mean deviation out of steady state obeys @xmath25 this shows that the correlation functions decay in exactly the same way as deviations away from steady state , so that eq .",
    "is an example of a regression theorem @xcite .",
    "is to be solved with the initial conditions @xmath26 .",
    "a convenient approach is by the use of the laplace transform , which allows the initial conditions to be automatically incorporated . taking the laplace transform of eq .",
    "shows that @xmath27 where @xmath28 eq .",
    "is a set of linear simultaneous equations which can readily be solved for @xmath29 .",
    "the power spectra now follow almost for free . comparing eq .   with eq .",

    "eqs .   and",
    "are the key results of this section .",
    "they indicate how exact results for the power spectra can be obtained for an arbitrary linear reaction network by purely algebraic methods . in appendix",
    "[ sec : appl ] we prove that the same results can be obtained from the chemical langevin equations described by gillespie @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the power spectra are simpler to obtain than the correlation functions themselves , which require an inverse fourier or laplace transform .",
    "to undertake such a step requires in general that a polynomial be factorised , which is not always possible .",
    "in fact the route to the power spectra , via eqs  , and in the appendix , just involves the solution of linear simultaneous equations .    , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",

    "these are chosen so that the two models have matched point statistics , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , and matching values of @xmath42.[fig : fig1 ] ]",
    "we first consider a very simple model of gene expression @xmath43 which represents a birth - death process in which @xmath44 copies of a are generated each time the first ( birth ) reaction fires .",
    "this represents the ` burstiness ' of gene expression in prokaryotes @xcite .",

    "the second two reactions represent generation of the protein a from m and the degradation of a. this is a model which has been analysed by other workers @xcite , and we recover previously known results for the point statistics .    the mean values in",
    "steady state are @xmath51 in this , @xmath52 is the mean number of copies of a produced in the lifetime of one mrna and can be taken to represent the ` burstiness ' of gene expression . comparing the last of eq .   with the first of eq .",
    ", it appears that @xmath53 in the present model corresponds to @xmath44 in the previous implicit mrna model . as we shall see though",
    ", this interpretation does not carry through to the other statistical properties .    the steady state variances and covariance",

    "we give only the result for the cross - correlation function , which exhibits the interesting time asymmetry mentioned above , @xmath62 ( using @xmath63 for the second line ) .",
    "finally , the power spectra are obtained .",
    "the power spectrum for m is @xmath64 .",
    "this might have been anticipated as a special case of the previous model with @xmath65 , since as far as m is concerned it is undergoing a simple birth - death process . the power spectrum for a is @xmath66 with a suitable choice of @xmath44 and rate cofficients @xmath67 and @xmath68 , the point statistics of the previous model in eq .",
    "could be matched to the present model in eq .  .",
    "however , it is in general impossible to match the power spectra since the @xmath69 dependence is different .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] shows the power spectra for the two models with matched point statistics .",
    "the presence of two correlation times in the explicit mrna model compared to a single relaxation time for the implicit mrna model is clearly seen .",
    "we have gone through the calculations in some detail for these two model , but for the subsequent calculations we will only give the final results .      a very simple model of signal detection is the reaction @xmath70 where a is the input signal and b is the output signal .",
    ".   has a chemical rate equation @xmath71 we have included an additional noise term @xmath72 in this , so it is actually a chemical langevin equation . taking the fourier transform yields @xmath73 the mean square modulus is then @xmath74 we have assumed that @xmath72 is uncorrelated with @xmath75 .",
    "the theory of chemical langevin equations @xcite ( see also appendix [ sec : appl ] ) shows that @xmath76 , and for @xmath77 one has @xmath78 , thus finally @xmath79 this result has quite a striking interpretation .",
    "the total noise in the output signal is made up of an _ extrinsic _ contribution ( first term ) plus an _ intrinsic _ contribution ( second term ) .",
    "moreover , the extrinsic noise is equal the input signal noise multiplied by a low - pass filter function .",
    "this is analogous to the behaviour of a passive rc circuit element @xcite .",
    "this result , in one form or another , was derived by paulsson @xcite , and by shibata and fujimoto @xcite .",
    "we refer to it as the ` spectral addition rule ' .",
    "it is a potentially important result because it indicates that there is a trade - off between signal amplification by the detection motif and signal contamination by added intrinsic noise .",
    "our exact results for linear reaction networks enable us to test the spectral addition rule .",
    "we find that its validity is limited by the assumption that the intrinsic noise @xmath72 is uncorrelated with the input signal @xmath75 .",
    "in particular , if the detection motif consumes molecules of the input signal , a correlation can arise which spoils the spectral addition rule .    to demonstrate this",
    ", we now consider the effect of adjoining eq .   onto the gene expression models in the previous section .",
    "we present results for the explicit mrna model , but similar conclusions can be drawn for the implicit mrna model too @xcite .",
    "we therefore solve @xmath80 we find that @xmath81 and @xmath82 } { ( \\omega^2+\\lambda^2)(\\omega^2+(\\gamma+\\nu)^2)(\\omega^2+\\mu^2)}\\ ] ] with @xmath83 .",
    "it is not hard to demonstrate that the spectral addition rule _ fails _ for these expressions .    as an aside",
    ", one can show @xmath84 . since the @xmath85 reaction in eq .",
    "can be regarded as post - translational modification step , this shows that post - translational modification can reduce the noise associated with gene expression .",
    "the reason is that the post - translational modification reaction smoothes the ` burstiness ' of gene expression by acting as a low - pass filter .    to appreciate the influence of coupling the detection reaction to the input signal noise",
    ", we now change the detection scheme so that the signal molecules a are _ not _ consumed , by replacing eq .   with @xmath86",
    "as far as b is concerned , it is important to note that the _ same _ chemical langevin equation eq",
    ".   holds for this detection scheme as for the previous scheme . for this variant",
    "we find @xmath87 is as given in eq .   and",

    "whilst we have only demonstrated the failure of the spectral addition rule for one particular case , the result is suggestive of the general conclusion that the spectral addition rule will only hold for detection schemes which do not consume input signal molecules .",
    "these conclusions can also be reached by analysing the chemical langevin equations for the whole network @xcite .",
    "there is a growing literature on the adiabatic elimination of fast reactions for stochastic chemical kinetics @xcite .",
    "for example kepler and elston @xcite , and shibata @xcite , have a formalism that permits a systematic approach to the problem , involving the identification of the fast and slow variables in the system . in a similar example , bundschuh _",
    "et al _ present simulation results which support the general strategy of elimination of fast variables in terms of slow variables @xcite . here",
    "we examine the procedure for elimination of a fast equilibration reaction in the context of the _ exact _",
    "results for a linear reaction network .",
    "our results shed light on the way in which fast equilibration reactions can be systematically eliminated from a reaction network , whilst preserving the noise attributes .    to make a concrete example",

    "these are ( a subset of ) the chemical rate equations for the following reaction network @xmath109 this is the same as the previously discussed scheme in eq .  , with the replacement @xmath110 .",
    "the power spectra follow from eqs .   accordingly .",
    "the important point to note is that this scheme not only has the correct chemical rate equations but also has the correct noise power spectra .",
    "now let us turn to the power spectra for a and a@xmath91 in the original network .",
    "we find that @xmath111 again these results are easy to rationalise , since inverting eqs .   and setting @xmath112 shows that @xmath113 ( the proportionality factors become squared when computing the noise power spectra ) .    for the variances , @xmath56 and @xmath114 , we find a different story though .",
    "in fact , in the limit @xmath95 , we find a _ breakdown _ of the sum rule in eq .  .",
    "the reason is that @xmath115 for @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",

    "[ fig : fig2 ] which shows typical results for @xmath162 at several increasing values of the equilibration rate .",
    "the results in this section are supportive of the general strategy of elimination of the fast variables in terms of the appropriate slow variables .",
    "to be specific , the strategy is to rewrite the chemical rate equations in terms of fast and slow variables , eliminate the fast variables , and re - interpret the reduced rate equations in terms of a reduced reaction network , possibly involving new chemical species ( in the present example , x replaces a and a@xmath91 ) .",
    "our study has provided examples where one can rigorously prove that this strategy is successful .",
    "firstly , let us make some general remarks about the use of noise power spectra to characterise the stochastic properties of chemical reaction networks . as we have shown , the noise power spectra are straightforward to calculate once one has the point statistics ( the mean values and the variance - covariance matrix ) , for a linear network , or for a linearisation of a non - linear network .",
    "in fact , the power spectra are _ easier _ to calculate than the autocorrelation functions , which in general require the factorisation of a polynomial , unless one is satisfied with stopping at the laplace - transformed autocorrelation functions . because the power spectra are functions of frequency , they are a more refined measure than the point statistics , and can be used for instance as a sensitive test of whether two reaction networks can be mapped onto one another .",
    "let us comment briefly on the situation for experiments and simulations .",
    "both face similar difficulties in measuring the power spectra .",
    "a signal of sufficiently long duration needs to be captured at sufficiently fine resolution in order to be able to estimate the power spectrum .",
    "event - driven simulations though , such as those based on the gillespie algorithm @xcite , have an advantage since in principle the exact moments when a signal changes its value are known .",
    "secondly , we discuss the biological relevance of our results .",
    "our results indicate that the way noise is transmitted through a signal detection motif may be more complicated than previously thought @xcite . in particular , if the detection motif consumes the input signal molecules , a correlation can be set up between the intrinsic noise generated by the detection motif , and the input signal noise . we have examined this in the context of a post - translational modification reaction attached to the output of a gene expression module .",
    "our analysis shows incidentally that post - translational modification can ameliorate the noise of gene expression , by smoothing out the ` burstiness ' of the translation step .",
    "we also examined the effect of a fast equilibration reaction interposed in the network .",
    "we find that , in the limit of infinitely fast equilibration , such a network can be exactly mapped onto a reduced or coarse - grained network through the use of suitably chosen slow variables .",
