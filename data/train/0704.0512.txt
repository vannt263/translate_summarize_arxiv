    "the simplest model exhibiting time - oscillations in a two - component system is the model proposed independently by lotka @xcite and by volterra @xcite . in this model",
    "the individuals of two species are dispersed over an assumed homogeneous space .",
    "it is implicitly assumed in this approach that any individual can interact with any other one with equal intensity implying that their positions are not taken into account .",
    "the time evolution of the densities of the two species in the lotka - volterra model is given by a set of two ordinary differential equations @xcite and is set up in analogy with the laws of mass - action .",
    "depending on the level of description wanted , the approach based on mass - action laws , contained on the lotka - volterra model , suffices . however , there are situations in which the coexistence takes place in a spatially heterogeneous habitat such that the population densities can be very low in some regions . in this case",
    "we need to proceed beyond the mass - law equations and consider the space structure of the habitat . in other words",
    ", it becomes necessary to analyze the coexistence by taking explicitly into account spatial structured models .",
    "in fact , the role of space in the description of population biology problems has been recognized by several authors in the last years @xcite . in a very clear manner , durrett and",
    "levin @xcite have pointed out that the modelling of population dynamics systems which are spatially distributed by interacting particle systems @xcite is the appropriate theoretical approach that is able to give the more complete description of the problem .",
    "we include in this approach probabilistic cellular automata ( pca ) @xcite , which will concern us here .",
    "we refer to interacting particle systems and pca as stochastic lattice models .",
    "they are both markovian processes defined by discrete stochastic variables residing on the sites of a lattice ; the former being a continuous time process and the latter a discrete time process .    in the present work we study the coexistence and the emergence of stable self - sustained oscillations in a predator - prey system by considering a pca previously studied by numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "this pca is defined by local rules , similar to the ones of the contact process @xcite , that are capable of describing the interaction between prey and predator . here , we focus on the analysis of the pca by means of dynamic mean - field approximations @xcite . in this approach",
    "the equations for the time evolution of correlations of various orders are truncated at a certain level and high order correlations of sites are written in terms of small order correlations .",
    "the simplest approximation is the one in which all correlations are written in terms of one - site correlation , called simple approximation . in a more sophisticated approximation , called pair approximation @xcite , any correlation is written in terms of one - site and two - site correlations .",
    "the simple mean - field approximation is capable of predicting coexistence of individuals in a stationary state where the densities of each species , and of empty sites , are constant .",
    "however , it is not capable of predicting possible time oscillating behavior of the population densities and we have proceed to the next order of mean - field approximation . the simple approximation , on the other hand , can be placed in an explicit correspondence with a patch model @xcite where unoccupied patches can be colonized by prey and patches occupied by prey can be colonized by predators that in turn may become extinct . in this approximation",
    "the pca can be seen as an extended version of the lotka - volterra model which includes an extra logistic term related to the empty sites .",
    "the pair - mean field approximation is able to predict possible time oscillating behavior of the population densities that are self - sustained and are attained thorough hopf bifurcations .",
    "this is in contrast with the lotka - volterra model which presents no stable oscillations but exhibits instead infinite cycles that are associated to different initial conditions .",
    "however , from the biological point of view , one does not expect that a small variation in the initial densities of prey and predator result in different amplitudes of oscillations . within our approach , a pca treated in the pair - approximation ,",
    "the oscillations are associated with limit cycles what mean to say that they are stable against the changes in the initial conditions . according to our point of view",
    ", the pair - approximation , in which the correlation between neighboring sites are treated exactly , provides a basic description of the predator - prey spatial interactions . for this reason",
    ", we will refer to the pca in this approximation as a quasi - spatial - structured model .",
    "we consider interacting particles living on the sites of a lattice and evolving in time according to markovian local rules .",
    "the lattice is the geometrical object that plays the role of the spatial region occupied by particles , in a general case , or by individuals of each species in the present case .",
    "the lattice sites are the possible locations for the individuals",
    ". each site can be either empty or occupied by one individual of different species and a stochastic variable @xmath0 is introduced to describe the state of each site at a given instant of time .",
    "the state of the entire system is denoted by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the total number of sites .",
    "the transition between the states is governed by the interactions between neighbor sites in the lattice and by a synchronous dynamics .",
    "the probability @xmath3 of configuration @xmath4 at time step @xmath5 evolves according to the markov chain equation @xmath6 where the summation is over all the microscopic configurations of the system , and @xmath7 is the conditional transition probability from state @xmath8 at time @xmath9 to state @xmath4 at time @xmath10 .",
    "this transition probability does not depend on time and contains all the information about the dynamics of the system .",
    "taking into account that all the sites are simultaneously updated , which is the fundamental property of a pca , the transition probability can be factorized and written in the form @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the conditional transition probability that site @xmath13 takes the state @xmath0 given that the whole system is in state @xmath14 .",
    "being a probability distribution , the quantity @xmath12 must satisfy the following properties : @xmath15 and @xmath16    the average of any state function @xmath17 is evaluated by @xmath18 the time evolution equation for @xmath19 is obtained from definition ( [ 3 ] ) and equation ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "for example , we can derive the equations for the time evolution of densities and two - site correlations .      to model a predator - prey system by a pca , the stochastic variable @xmath20 associated to site @xmath13",
    "will represent the occupancy of the site by one prey , or the occupancy by one predator or the vacancy ( a site devoid of any individual ) .",
    "the variable @xmath20 is assumed to take the value 0 , 1 , or 2 , according to whether the site is empty ( v ) , occupied by a prey individual ( h ) or by a predator ( p ) , respectively .",
    "that is , @xmath21 which defines a three - state per site pca .",
    "the stochastic rules , embodied in the transition rate @xmath22 , are set up according to the following assumptions .",
    "( a ) the space is homogeneous , which means to say that no region of the space will be privileged against the others , that is , in principle the individuals have the same conditions of surveillance in any space region .",
    "( b ) the space is isotropic , which means to say that there is no preferential direction in this space for any interaction .",
    "( c ) the allowed transitions between states are only the ones that obey the cyclic order shown in figure [ vhp ] .",
    "prey can only born in empty sites ; prey can give place to a predator , in a process where a prey individual dies and a predator is instantaneously born ; finally a predator can die leaving an empty site .",
    "the empty sites are places where prey can proliferate and can be seen as the resource for prey surveillance .",
    "the death of predators complete this cycle , reintegrating to the system the resources for prey .",
    "the predator - prey pca has three parameters : @xmath23 , the probability of birth of prey , @xmath24 , the probability of birth of predator and death of prey , and @xmath25 , the probability of predator death .",
    "two of the process are catalytic : the occupancy of a site by prey or by a predator is conditioned , respectively , to the existence of prey or predator in the neighborhood of the site .",
    "the third reaction , where predator dies , is spontaneous , that is , it occurs , with probability @xmath25 , independently of the neighbors of the site .",
    "we assume that @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",
    "the transition probabilities of the predator - prey pca are described in what follows :    \\(a ) if a site @xmath13 is empty , @xmath28 , and there is at least one prey in its first neighborhood there is a favorable condition for the birth of a new prey .",
    "the probability of site @xmath13 being occupied in next time step by a prey is proportional to the parameter @xmath23 and to the number of prey that are in the first neighborhood of the empty site .",
    "\\(b ) if a site is occupied by a prey , @xmath29 , and there is at least one predator in its first neighborhood then the site has a probability of being occupied by a new predator in the next instant of time . in this process",
    "the prey dies instantaneously .",
    "the transition probability is proportional to the parameter @xmath24 and the number of predators in first neighborhood of the site .",
    "\\(c ) if site @xmath13 is occupied by a predator , @xmath30 , it dies with probability @xmath25 .",
    "the transition probabilities associated to the three processes above mentioned can be summarized as follows : @xmath31 \\delta(\\eta_i,0 ) ,    \\label{4}\\ ] ] @xmath32\\delta(\\eta_{i},1 ) ,    \\label{5}\\ ] ] @xmath33 where @xmath34 and the summation is over the four nearest neighbors of site @xmath13 in a regular square lattice .",
    "the notation @xmath35 stands for the kronecker delta function .",
    "these stochastic local rules , when inserted in equation ( [ 2 ] ) , define the dynamics of the pca for a predator - prey system .",
    "the present stochastic dynamics predicts the existence of states , called absorbing states , in which the system becomes trapped .",
    "once the system has entered such a state it can not escape from it anymore remaining there forever .",
    "there are two absorbing states .",
    "one of them is the empty lattice .",
    "since the predator death is spontaneous , a configuration where just predators are present is not stationary .",
    "this situation happens whenever the prey have been extinct . in this case",
    "the predator can not reproduce anymore and also get extinct , leaving the entire lattice with empty sites .",
    "the other absorbing state is the lattice full of prey .",
    "this situation occurs if there are few predators and they become extinct .",
    "the remaining prey will then reproduce without predation filling up the whole lattice .",
    "the existence of absorbing stationary states is an evidence of the irreversible character of the model or , in other words , of the lack of detailed balance @xcite .",
    "however , the most interesting states , the ones that we are concerned with in the present study , are the active states characterized by the coexistence of prey and predators .      we start by defining the densities , which are the one - site correlations , and the two - site correlations",
    ". these quantities will be useful in our mean - field analysis to be developed below .",
    "the density of prey , predator , and empty sites at time step @xmath5 are defined thought the expressions @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 the evolution equations for the above densities are obtained from their definitions as state functions , as given by equation ( [ 3 ] ) , and by using the evolution equation for @xmath3 , given by equation ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "the resulting equations can be formally written as @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 where the transition probabilities for this model are given in equations ( [ 4 ] ) , ( [ 5 ] ) and ( [ 6 ] ) .",
    "the correlation between a prey localized at site @xmath13 and a predator localized at site @xmath42 at time step @xmath5 is defined by @xmath43 the other two - site correlations are defined similarly .",
    "the time evolution equation for the correlation of two neighbor sites @xmath13 and @xmath42 , one being occupied by a prey and the other by a predator , is given by @xmath44 the other two - site evolution equations are given by similar formal expressions",
    ". we can also derive equations for three - site correlations .",
    "since we are interested here on approximations in which only the one - site and two - site correlations should be treated exactly , the above equations suffice .",
    "we call the attention to the fact that equation ( [ 8 ] ) includes the product of two transition probabilities .",
    "this is a consequence of the synchronous update of the pca which allows that both neighboring sites @xmath13 and @xmath42 have their states changed at same time step .",
    "this situation does not occur when we consider a continuous time one - site dynamics .",
    "therefore , although local interaction in the present pca and in the continuous time model considered in reference @xcite are the same , the predator - prey system evolves according to different global dynamics which leads to different time evolution equations for the densities and the correlations .",
    "the exact evolution equations for the one - site correlations are @xmath45 @xmath46 where the summation in @xmath42 is over the @xmath47 nearest neighbors of site @xmath13 . to simplify notation we are using unprimed and primed quantities to refer to quantities taken at time @xmath5 and @xmath10 , respectively .",

    "the evolution equation for a density in any interacting particle system which evolves in time according to local interaction rules always contains terms related to the correlations between neighbor sites in a lattice .",
    "the evolution equations for the correlations of two neighbor sites includes the correlation of clusters of three or more sites in the lattice and so on . in this way we can have an infinite set of coupled equations for the correlations which is equivalent to the evolution equation for the probability @xmath53 , described in equation ( [ 1 ] ) for the automaton .",
    "the scope of the dynamic mean - field approximation consists in the truncation of this infinite set of coupled equations @xcite .",
    "the lowest order dynamic mean - field approximation is the one where the probability of a given cluster is written as the product of the probabilities of each site .",
    "that is , all the correlations between sites in the cluster are neglected .",
    "for example , let us consider the cluster constituted by a center ( c ) site and its first neighboring sites to the north ( n ) , south ( s ) , east ( e ) and west ( w ) as shown in figure [ news ] .    within the one - site approximation",
    "the probability @xmath54 corresponding to the cluster shown in figure [ news ] is approximated by @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 are the one - site probabilities corresponding to each site .",
    "for some stochastic dynamics models this approximation is able to give qualitative results that are in agreement with the expected results .    in order to get a better approximation",
    "we must include fluctuations .",
    "the simplest mean - field approximation that includes correlations is the pair - mean field approximation .",
    "this approximation is better explained by taking again , as an example , the cluster constituted by a center site which and its four nearest neighbors , shown above . within the pair - approximation the conditional probability @xmath58 is approximated by @xmath59 that is",

    "the simple mean - field approximation of the predator - prey pca describes exactly the same properties of an extended levins patch model @xcite .",
    "that is , the pca with local rules similar to the contact process becomes , in the simple mean - field approximation , analogous to the levins model for metapopulation with empty patches , patches colonized by prey and patches colonized by predators .    in the one - site mean - field approximation",
    "we consider that the probability of any cluster of sites can be written as the product of the probabilities of each site , as in equation ( [ smf ] ) . using this approach , and writing @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 it can be seen that the set of equations can be reduced to the following two - dimensional map @xcite @xmath69 which is an evolution equation for prey density @xmath70 , and @xmath71 which is an evolution equation for predator density @xmath72 .",
    "notice that @xmath73    the fixed point of this map are those that represent the stationary solutions @xmath74 and @xmath75 , and they correspond to the three following solutions @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 , @xmath81 .",
    "the first solution corresponds to an absorbing states where both species have been extinct .",
    "the second corresponds to an absorbing state where predators have extinct .",
    "the third solution corresponds to an active state where prey and predator coexist .    due to the constraint ( [ abc ] ) , the parameters @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are not all independent and only two can be chosen as independent . for this reason it is convenient to introduce the following parametrization @xcite @xmath82 and consider @xmath83 and @xmath25 as the independent variables .",

    "the empty absorbing state will never be reached .",
    "a linear stability analysis also shows that the solution @xmath88 is a stable node in the following region of the phase diagram @xmath89 where @xmath90 the active solution is stable in the region @xmath91 and is attained in two ways : by an asymptotic stable focus , where the successive interactions of the map show damped oscillations ; or trough an asymptotic stable node . in the phase diagram of figure [ diag - one ]",
    "we show the transition line between the prey absorbing state and the active state given by @xmath92 .    in figure",
    "[ dens - one ] it is shown the behavior of the densities against the parameter @xmath25 , the probability of predators death , for the special case @xmath93 . in terms of phase transitions what happens",
    "is that in the phase diagram there is a transition line separating the absorbing prey phase and the active phase which is characterized by constant and nonzero densities of prey and predator .",
    "we may conclude that the mean - field approximation for the predator - prey probabilistic cellular automaton with rules ( [ 4 ] ) , ( [ 5 ] ) , and ( [ 6 ] ) is capable to show , under a robust set of control parameters , that prey and predators can coexist without extinction .",
    "however the map defined by equations ( [ 9 ] ) and ( [ 10 ] ) is not able to describe self - sustained oscillations of species population densities .      in order to find",
    "if oscillations in the species populations can be described within a mean - field approach we consider a more sophisticated approximation , the pair - approximation , where correlations of two neighbor sites are included in the time evolution equations for the densities .",
    "this is the lowest order mean - field approximation which takes into account the spatial localization of neighboring individuals .    in this analysis",
    "we will maintain the correlations of one site and the correlations of two - sites in the equations .",
    "correlations of three and four neighbor sites will be approximated by means of equation ( [ pairmf ] ) . with these approximation",

    "the last three correlations are not independent but are related to others by @xmath112 @xmath113 @xmath114 we used the properties @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 , that follows from the assumption that space is isotropic and homogeneous .",
    "we have analyzed numerically the five - dimensional map , described by the set of equations ( [ pair1 ] ) , ( [ pair2 ] ) , ( [ pair3 ] ) , ( [ pair4 ] ) and ( [ pair5 ] ) , and we have obtained four types of solutions .",
    "two solutions are trivial and are given by @xmath118 and @xmath119 , @xmath120 .",
    "they correspond to the empty and prey absorbing states , respectively .",
    "the empty absorbing state , where both species have been extinct is an unstable solution and never occurs .",

    "below this line it becomes unstable giving rise to the active state .",
    "the other solutions correspond to the active states where both prey and predator coexist .",
    "these solutions are of two kinds : a stationary solution where there is a coexistence of the two species with densities constant in time , which we call the nonoscillating ( no ) active state ; and another solution where both population densities oscillate in time .",
    "this solution corresponds to a self - sustained oscillation of the predator - prey system and will be called the oscillating ( o ) active state . in the phase diagram of figure [ diag - two ]",
    "there is a line @xmath122 that separates the no and o active phases .",
    "figure [ dens - two ] shows the behavior of the densities as a function of @xmath25 for @xmath123 .      in figure [ osc - ab ]",
    "we show an example of self - sustained oscillations of the densities of prey and predators as functions of time .",
    "the oscillating solutions are attained from the nonoscillating solutions by a hopf bifurcation .",
    "the fixed point associated to this solution is an unstable center which produces a stable limit cycle as trajectories in the phase - space of the predator density versus prey density , as can be seen in figure [ osc - ab ] .",
    "notice that the oscillations are not damped and have a well defined period which is the same for the prey density and for the predator density , which implies that the oscillations are coupled .",
    "a maximum of predators always follow a maximum of prey .",
    "this means that the abundance of prey is a condition that favors the increase in the number of predators .",
    "as the predator number increases the prey population decays .",
    "the evanescence of prey is followed by a decrease in the predator number , giving conditions for the increase of prey population until the cycle starts again .",
    "a well defined oscillatory behavior is found for many biological population , the most famous being the one related to the time oscillations of the population of lynx and snowshoe hare in canada for which data were collected for a long period of time @xcite .",
    "if the hare population cycles are mainly governed by the lynx cycle then the oscillations shown by the present model reproduces qualitatively some of the features of this predator - prey dynamics .",
    "next we analyze the behavior of the frequency and amplitude of oscillations . fixing the parameter @xmath83 and varying the parameter @xmath25",
    ", we verify that in all the oscillating region the frequency of oscillation is proportional to parameter @xmath25 , @xmath124 as can be seen in figure [ freq - ampl ] .",
    "low frequencies are associated to low values of @xmath25 ; what means that , for small values of @xmath25 , the greater the predator lifetime the greater will be period of the oscillation . as to the amplitude @xmath125 of the oscillations , we have verified , that fixing the value of @xmath83 and varying the parameter @xmath25 , it increases as @xmath25 decreases .",
    "our results show that , @xmath126 as expected for a hopf bifurcation and shown in figure [ freq - ampl ] .",
    "the transition line @xmath127 from the oscillating phase to the nonoscillating phase can either be obtained by using the criterion given by equation ( [ 17 ] ) or by analyzing the eigenvalues associated to the map given by the set of equations ( [ pair1 ] ) , ( [ pair2 ] ) , ( [ pair3 ] ) , ( [ pair4 ] ) and ( [ pair5 ] ) .",
    "this last criterion means to find the points of phase diagram such that the real part of the dominant complex eigenvalue equals @xmath128 .",
    "the main result coming from the pair mean - field approximation applied to the predator - prey pca is that it is possible to describe coexistence and self - sustained time oscillations .",
    "moreover , these are stable oscillations . given a set of parameters , just one limit cycle is achieved , no matter what the initial conditions are . this property is essential in describing a biological system since a small variation in the initial condition can not modify the amplitude , frequency and mean value of the time oscillation densities of a predator - prey system .",
    "similar results were obtained from a continuous time version of the present model @xcite .",
    "although the simple mean - field equations are essentially the same in both versions this is not the case concerning the pair mean - field approximation .",
    "the time evolutions of the pair correlations for the pca , presented here , depend on higher order correlations ( up to fourth ) when compared to the ones of the continuous version ( up to third ) .",
    "the model studied here is a spatial structured model with individuals residing in sites of a lattice and described by discrete dynamic variables .",
    "when we perform simple mean - field approximation we neglect all the correlations of sites in the lattice .",
    "but we take into account that there are limited resources for the surveillance of each species .",
    "for example in the time evolution equation for the density of prey we have an explicit term relative to reaction of birth of prey which is the product of the density of prey @xmath70 by the density of empty sites @xmath129 . this coincides with an extended patch model approach for predator - prey systems .",
    "the presence of this term is what differs the simple mean - field equations from the lotka - volterra equations .",
    "however , taking into account the limitation of space and resources the simple mean - field equations are not sufficient to get self - sustained oscillations although able to describe damped time oscillations of population densities .    to get self - sustained time oscillations we had to proceed to the next level of approximation in which a pair of nearest neighbor sites is treated exactly .",
    "this approximation can be seen as representing a pair of nearest neighbor sites immersed in a mean field produced by the rest of the lattice .",
    "the most important feature being the fact that the two sites of this pair can be seen as localized in space .",
    "the set of five equations which results from the pair approximation for the pca is indeed able to produce self - sustained oscillations of population densities .",
    "it presents an important property that the lotka - volterra model lacks , namely , the oscillating solutions are stable and are unique for a given set of the control parameters .",

    "<S> the pair approximation is moreover able to describe two types of coexistence of prey and predators : one where population densities are constant in time and another displaying self - sustained time - oscillations of the population densities . </S>",
    "<S> the oscillations are associated with limit cycles and arise through a hopf bifurcation . </S>",
    "<S> they are stable against changes in the initial conditions and , in this sense , they differ from the lotka - volterra cycles which depend on initial conditions . in this respect , </S>",
    "<S> the present model is biologically more realistic than the lotka - volterra model . </S>"
