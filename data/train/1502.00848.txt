    "femtoscopy aims at measuring the size of the particle emitting source .",
    "experimentally , this is achieved by studying two - particle correlations at small relative momenta .",
    "if the size of the system is large , the emissions of the two particles will likely be substantially separated in space .",
    "therefore , no interaction or symmetrization will take place and the momenta will be uncorrelated .",
    "if  on the other hand  the extent of the source is small , the vicinity of the emanation points will trigger the species - specific interplay with a characteristic dependence of the correlation on the momentum difference .",
    "given that the two - particle interaction is known , a source size can be inferred from the correlation function .",
    "no coulomb or quantum - statistical effects take place in the p@xmath1  system and the strong interaction parameters are sufficiently well known from , e.g. , bubble chamber experiments . a typical reaction for studying the p@xmath1  final - state interaction is the production of @xmath1baryons by shooting a beam of negatively charged kaons on a hydrogen target as done with the saclay bubble chamber  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1   hyperon  created via @xmath4  can subsequently scatter elastically off another proton .",
    "measuring the cross - section of the elastic process differentially vs.  the excess energy directly quantifies the attractive final - state strong interaction , which turns out to be comparable to the nucleon - nucleon one .",
    "based on the model by lednick and lyuboshits  @xcite , the sensitivity of the p@xmath1   correlation function to the volume of the hot and dense medium created in heavy - ion collisions was first explored in  @xcite .",
    "the correlation was found to be affected in height and shape by the size of the source .",
    "furthermore , the interdependence of the two momenta was shown to keep its susceptibility to a change in source size for radii larger than 4  fm  an advantage over the coulomb - depleted proton - proton correlations .",
    "a particularly interesting subject is the investigation of the reaction dynamics of the strongly interacting matter generated in collisions .",
    "the large pressure gradients give rise to an expansion of the medium .",
    "the resulting collective velocity competes with the thermal velocity @xmath5 ; consequently the @xmath0  dependence of the radii probes the dynamics of the source . at low @xmath0 ,",
    "no strong collective motion is present and the particles will be correlated over the full extent of the source . at high @xmath0  in contrast",
    ", the radial flow introduces a positive correlation between the emission point and the particle s momentum . looking only at pairs of particles with a small momentum difference",
    ", the couple s constituents will originate from the same region , which is smaller than the geometrical size of the fireball , leading to the apparent shrinking of the particle source with @xmath0 . to probe the high @xmath0  regime , it is experimentally beneficial to investigate particles with a high rest mass .",
    "so far , the p@xmath1system is the heaviest studied system  @xcite .",
    "the analyzed  data was taken with  @xcite .",
    "the t0 and v0 scintillator arrays provided an event - trigger signal and an estimate for the collision centrality .",
    "the main detectors for particle tracking in alice are the inner tracking system , time projection chamber ( tpc ) , and transition radiation detector .",
    "particle identification for this analysis was performed by the tpc and the time of flight ( tof ) detector .",
    "the vanishing @xmath6 at the lhc entails that matter and anti - matter are produced in equal abundance .",
    "while the correlation functions for pairs of p@xmath1  and @xmath7 were obtained separately , the selections for particles discussed in the following hold true for their charge conjugates as well .",
    "the proton selection depended on the reconstructed momentum and used the tpc and/or tof .",
    "the resolution of the truncated specific energy loss measurement ( @xmath8 ) can be parametrized with a gaussian of width @xmath9 .",
    "the tpc provided a separation of the most probable @xmath8  measurement for protons to the one of any other species of more than four @xmath9 up to @xmath10 . above this kinematic restriction , the expected @xmath8  for protons and",
    "the ultra - relativistic electrons becomes too similar , which impeded an unambiguous particle identification by the tpc alone . for higher momenta up to @xmath11",
    ", tof allowed for an unambiguous proton identification  @xcite . with the chosen criteria a proton purity  defined as the number of protons over the number of all selected particles including misidentified tracks ",
    "above 99% was achieved over the full dynamic span .",
    "the @xmath1  selection was based upon a @xmath12  topology finder , which reconstructs the charged decay @xmath13 ; the hyperon is identified via the invariant mass .",
    "[ fig : lampur ] ( left ) shows a fit to the invariant mass distribution of all @xmath1  candidates employing a monte - carlo template for the signal shape in an exemplary phase - space bin with a high yield , namely @xmath14 and @xmath15 , for the 10% most central events .",
    "the parametrization allows to determine the purity of the sample  defined as the ratio of picked @xmath1  particles to all taken @xmath12  vertices  which amounts in this case to @xmath16 within the window in invariant mass of @xmath17 around the pdg value .",
    "determining the purity enables one to correct the correlation function for the uncorrelated background in a following step .",
    "[ fig : lampur ] ( right ) shows the evolution of the @xmath1  purity as a function of rapidity and transverse momentum for the 10% most central events .",
    "protons knocked - out from an interaction with the detector material resemble displaced tracks from weak particle decay vertices .",
    "a contribution of protons from material manifests itself in a degradation of the purity for @xmath18 ; the effect is absent for the case of @xmath19 . for higher transverse momenta ,",

    "the p@xmath1  strong interaction is limited in its range to a few fm .",
    "hence , any product from electro - magnetic or weak decays will not contribute to the excess seen at small relative momenta .",
    "the contamination in the proton sample mostly stems from the decay @xmath23 .",
    "since no significant @xmath1@xmath1  correlation was seen by the star collaboration  @xcite , the decay proton will also not carry any residual correlation  @xcite from the mother particle.@xmath1   anti - correlation .",
    "the momentum released in the @xmath1  decay will wash this correlation out ; the small fraction of @xmath24 pairs in the p@xmath1 sample will make it a tiny , likely negligible , correction . ]",
    "the determination of the amount of this uncorrelated feed - down allows for a correction of the p@xmath1  correlation function with the feed - down fraction @xmath25 .",
    "the outstanding performance of alice allows to determine this feed - down fraction in the proton sample directly from the data via the distance of closest approach ( dca ) of the track extrapolation to the primary vertex .",
    "the two - dimensional ( transverse and longitudinal ) dca distribution was obtained differentially in rapidity , transverse momentum , and centrality for the data , as well as for templates from monte - carlo simulations for primary protons , protons from weak decays , and protons from an interaction with the detector material . the distinct shapes of the templates  almost flat in dca for the material contribution , wide for the weak decays , and peaked for the primaries  allow to disentangle the different origins of the charged nucleons by fitting the templates to the data , as pictured in fig .",

    "@xmath26 and @xmath27 , the feed - down fraction @xmath28 totals to 15% .",
    "this arises from the amount of particles which are from weak decays and from material of 15% and less than 1% , respectively .",

    "the contributing , dominating weak decays are @xmath30 ( br 99.5% ) , @xmath31 ( br 99.9% ) , @xmath32 ( br 67.8% ) , and @xmath33 ( br 32.2% ) .",
    "the reconstruction efficiencies with the chosen @xmath1  selection criteria in this analysis for all @xmath34 , and @xmath35 were obtained three - dimensionally in @xmath36 for each centrality class of  @xcite from a monte - carlo simulation . using the @xmath37-differential spectra of @xmath38 , and @xmath35 measured by alice  @xcite for several centrality classes and",
    "assuming isospin symmetry for the unmeasured @xmath39 and @xmath40 , enabled us to determine the fraction of @xmath1hyperons from weak decays .",
    "the @xmath41  pm of the electro - magnetic decay @xmath42 ( br 100% ) is much larger than the range of the strong interaction , but also too small to be resolved experimentally . in",
    "@xcite it was found that the final - state interaction in the p@xmath43 channel is much smaller than in the p@xmath1   system .",
    "thus , a significant fraction of @xmath1  come from @xmath43 and are uncorrelated with primary protons .",
    "we use the fraction of @xmath1  from @xmath43  properly taking into account all strongly decaying resonances  from the thermal model of  @xcite , while systematically considering the study in  @xcite with an additional variation in the freeze - out temperature , and the results of  @xcite with the value at the kinetic and chemical freeze - out .",
    "all models give that about 30% of the @xmath1  originate from a electromagnetic decay .",
    "we unite the fraction from weak and electromagnetic hyperon decays in the feed - down fraction @xmath44 .",
    "the raw p@xmath1  correlation as a function of the momentum difference is obtained as the ratio of pairs from real events over those reconstructed from mixed events for three centrality divisions and up to four @xmath0  classes for each centrality class .",
    "dealing with non - identical particles , we use the generalized momentum difference introduced in  @xcite by r.  lednick @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the momenta of the particles . in the following ,",
    "we omit the tilde .",

    "its value of 95.1% is constant over the region of interest @xmath51 and beyond .",
    "it is obtained by looking up the single - particle @xmath1  purity in the @xmath52-differential histograms for the given centrality ; the same holds for @xmath28 and @xmath44 accordingly .",
    "all impurities constitute  as discussed  an uncorrelated background .",
    "hence , the corrected correlation function can be attained by scaling the raw correlation function with the inverse pair purity : @xmath53    r0.62     the effect of the finite momentum resolution was studied with a monte - carlo simulation . for small relative momenta , i.e.  @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the reconstructed and @xmath56 is the generated relative momentum , the deviation , quantified as @xmath57 , can be parametrized with a gaussian with a mean of @xmath58 and @xmath59  and a width of @xmath60 and @xmath61  for the 010 and 3050% most central events . in an @xmath0-differential study , the width turned out to slightly increase by less than 2  for higher @xmath0 .",

    "[ eq : c2corr ] , i.e.  remedied for the uncorrelated background coming from weak and electro - magnetic decays .",
    "the correlation functions for pairs of particles and pairs of anti - particles were merged following the recipe of the particle data group  @xcite .",
    "the systematic errors include a variation of the correction for the electro - magnetic feed - down , a change in the hyperon input spectra for the correction of the @xmath1  from weak decays , an altered momentum resolution , normalization , invariant mass selection of the @xmath1 , changed dca cuts on the proton , a varied two - track resolution cut , and dominantly the uncertainty on the p@xmath1  interaction when fitting the data .",
    "the top panel shows the centrality dependence , i.e.  the 010% most central events in red and the 3050% most central events in blue ; both samples have a mean transverse mass of 1.5  .",
    "one clearly sees the expected effect of an increased width and height of the excess at small relative momenta , which translates into a smaller source size , for the more peripheral collisions .",
    "the bottom panel shows the dependence on @xmath0  with the green points representing @xmath62 resulting in @xmath63 = 1.27  and the orange symbols depicting @xmath50 yielding @xmath63 = 2.18  for the 010% most central events .",
    "also here , a clear ordering is apparent with the higher @xmath0  giving evidence for a smaller source than at lower @xmath0 , matching the expectation within the hydrodynamic picture outlined in the introduction .",
    "note that the correlation function with @xmath3 exceeds the @xmath63 of any previous measurement from  @xcite at the sps , @xcite at rhic or @xcite at the lhc .",
    "the supreme performance of  makes it possible to collect very pure samples of protons and @xmath1  with rich statistics .",
