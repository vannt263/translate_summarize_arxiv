    "quantum entanglement plays an important role in quantum information processing and transmission , such as quantum computation @xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum dense coding @xcite , quantum state sharing @xcite and certain types of quantum cryptography @xcite . in order to complete these tasks efficiently , people need to share some maximally entangled states . in a practical transmission ,",
    "the interaction between a quantum system and the innocent noise of quantum channel ( such as optical fibers or a free space ) will inevitably occur , which will degrade the entanglement of the quantum system or even make it in a mixed state .",
    "the impurity of the quantum system will make the outcome of the quantum computation anamorphic , the fidelity of quantum teleportation degraded , quantum dense coding failed and the key in quantum cryptography insecure . if the destructive effect of the noise is not very much , one can exploit entanglement concentration or entanglement purification to improve the entanglement of the quantum system first , and then achieve the goals of the applications above with maximally entangled state .    entanglement concentration @xcite is used to increase the entanglement of some pure entangled pairs at the risk of that of some others . for the more general case of the quantum system transmitted through a noisy channel , it is in a mixed state and the process for reconstructing it in a maximally entangled state with an ensemble is termed as entanglement purification or distillation @xcite . generally , the implementation of entanglement purification schemes requires two or more controlled - not ( cnot ) gates which is not experimentally feasible with linear optical elements at present . in 1996 ,",

    "are used to complete the task of parity - check measurements of polarized photons with their spatial modes .",
    "we call it pbs protocol below .",
    "this protocol succeeds , provided that two ideal entangled sources are used .",
    "that is , both emit one and only one entangled photon pair synchronously at each time slot . as pointed out by simon and pan @xcite in 2002 , the currently available source of entangled photons ,",
    "parametric down - conversion ( pdc ) , is not an ideal entangled source .",
    "the feature of pdc seems to fail for the pbs protocol @xcite .",
    "they then proposed a new entanglement purification protocol by exploiting spatial entanglement to purify polarization entanglement , which solves the problem above perfectly @xcite , and called it simon - pan protocol .",
    "however , in order to improve the fidelity of the entangled pairs kept more with the pbs protocol @xcite , the two parties should exploit quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) measurement to determine whether there are photons after the pbs or not , which can not be accomplished only with pbs .",
    "moreover , photon number detectors should be used to distinguish the two - photon cases from the cases with four photons in the same modes such as two photons in the upper modes of both alice s and bob s location .",
    "this task can not be accomplished simply with linear optical elements .",
    "cross - kerr nonlinearity provides a good tool to construct nondestructive quantum nondemolition detectors `` which have the potential available of being able to condition the evolution of our system but without necessarily destroying the single photons '' @xcite .",
    "qnd with a cross - kerr medium and a coherent state can be used for checking the parity of the polarizations of two photons @xcite , operating as a controlled - not ( cnot ) gate @xcite , and analyzing the bell states @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of a cross - kerr nonlinear medium can be described by the form as follows : @xmath0 where @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) denotes the number operator for mode a ( c ) and @xmath3 is the coupling strength of the nonlinearity , which is decided by the property of material .",
    "for example , for a signal photon state @xmath4 and a coherent state @xmath5 , the cross - kerr interaction causes the combined system composed of a single photon and a coherent state to evolve as @xcite @xmath6 we note that @xmath7 and @xmath8 are not the polarization of the photons , but the number of the photons .",
    "@xmath9 is also called the fock state which means the state contains @xmath10 photons .",
    "now one can see that the signal photon state is unaffected by the interaction , but the coherent state makes a phase shift of @xmath11 . here",

    "<S> the first one is a primary entanglement purification protocol for pdc sources with nondestructive quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) detectors by transferring the spatial entanglement of photon pairs to their polarization . in this time , the qnd detectors act as the role of controlled - not ( cnot ) gates . </S>",
    "<S> also they can distinguish the photon number of the spatial modes , which provides a good way for the next process to purify the entanglement of the photon pairs kept more . </S>",
    "<S> in the second process for entanglement purification , new qnd detectors are designed to act as the role of cnot gates . </S>",
    "<S> this protocol has the advantage of high yield and it requires neither cnot gates based on linear optical elements nor sophisticated single - photon detectors , which makes it more convenient in practical applications . </S>"
