    "the motivation to study nuclear parton distributions are the hard probes of strongly interacting matter @xcite . due to a large momentum ( or mass ) scale @xmath12 involved , these processes take place during the very first fractions of fm/@xmath13 in the high energy nuclear collisions , acting as probes of the forming quark gluon plasma . due to the large scale , hard processes are computable within qcd perturbation theory . to a first approximation",
    "the cross sections of hard processes in nuclear collisions can be factorized as in hadronic collisions , into parton densities and a hard parton - parton cross section .",
    "the parton distributions in bound and free protons , however , are different : @xmath14 . typically in hard collisions @xmath15 , so quite different regions in @xmath16 become relevant when moving from the present sps - energies @xmath17 gev up to the future lhc energies @xmath18 tev . thus there is a need for analyses of nuclear parton distributions which consistently cover sufficiently wide ranges in @xmath16 and @xmath4 . in this talk , i will present the main results from such an analysis @xcite .    in deeply inelastic @xmath2 scatterings ( dis ) , ratios of measured differential cross sections , @xmath19 , reflect the corresponding ratios of the nuclear structure function @xmath20 and that of deuterium @xmath21 .",
    "the ratio @xmath1 is observed to deviate clearly from unity @xcite . since @xmath22 $ ] , parton distributions in bound protons obviously differ from those in the free proton . often the nuclear modifications are referred to as shadowing @xmath23 , anti - shadowing @xmath24 , emc effect @xmath25 and fermi motion ( @xmath26 and beyond ) .",
    "the dependence on the bjorken @xmath16 has been observed already in the 80 s @xcite but the weaker @xmath4 dependence was detected only fairly recently by the nmc @xcite .    in refs .",
    "@xcite our goal has _ not _ been to study the actual origin of the modifications but , rather - because perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) does not predict the absolute parton distributions - to use the observed effects as _ input _ for an analysis in the perturbative region . the basic idea in our study is the same as in the global analyses of parton distributions of the free proton ( like in ref .",
    "@xcite ) : we determine the nuclear parton densities at a wide range of @xmath16 and @xmath27 through their perturbative qcd ( dglap @xcite ) evolution by using available experimental data and conservation of momentum and baryon number as constraints .",
    "information of the nuclear parton distributions can be obtained from @xmath2 dis and drell - yan ( dy ) measurements in @xmath3 collisions . in these measurements , the accessible values of @xmath16 and @xmath4",
    "are strongly correlated , as illustrated in fig . 1 . to perform the dglap evolution of the parton densities , however , the initial distributions are needed along a fixed scale @xmath28",
    ". therefore , we determine the initial nuclear parton distributions at @xmath28 _ iteratively _ , through the dglap evolution , by using the available data at scales @xmath29 as constraints . note that now the problem is more complicated than in the free proton case because of the additional variable @xmath30 .",
    "-1.0 cm -7 cm    2.cm    we take the parton distributions of the free proton as accurately known .",
    "we choose @xmath31 gev@xmath32 which is the @xmath13-quark mass threshold in the set grvlo @xcite we are using as the basis .",
    "we first parametrize the ratio @xmath33 for ( isoscalar ) @xmath30 and @xmath16 .",
    "the potential but small nuclear effects in deuterium , and the small tails at @xmath34 are neglected here . at the initial scale @xmath28",
    "( but only at @xmath28 ) , we assume that the nuclear sea quarks and antiquarks are modified approximately with the same profile , and similarly for the valence quarks",
    ". the ratio @xmath1 can then be simply written as a linear combination of a sea quark ratio @xmath35 and a valence quark ratio @xmath36 , where @xmath37 are the total sea ( valence ) distributions . the ratios @xmath38 and @xmath39 at @xmath28 in turn are constrained by the dis data @xcite and dy data in @xmath3 collisions @xcite ( see fig .",
    "1 ) at higher scales .",
    "@xmath39 is also further constrained by baryon number conservation .",
    "momentum conservation gives an overall constraint for the gluon distributions at @xmath28 . in lack of any direct constraints for the nuclear gluons from the data , we assume that initially @xmath40 at very small values of @xmath16 . the value of @xmath16 where @xmath41 is estimated on the basis of ref .",
    "for more details , please see ref .",
    "once the initial distributions for all parton flavours have been determined like this , the dglap evolution to larger scales can be performed , and comparison with the data can be made ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the initial ratios @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 at @xmath45 are then iterated until a `` best '' initial condition is found .     *",
    "( a)7.5 cm ( b ) *    -1 cm    -1.9 cm -1.0 cm    -.5 cm    fig",
    ". 2a shows the scale evolution of the nuclear effects in parton distributions for an isoscalar nucleus @xmath30=208 .",
    "the ratios @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath1 are shown as functions of @xmath16 at fixed values of @xmath49 2.25  gev@xmath32 ( solid lines ) , 5.39  gev@xmath32 ( dotted ) , 14.7  gev@xmath32 ( dashed ) , 39.9  gev@xmath32 ( dotted - dashed ) , 108  gev@xmath32 ( double - dashed ) , equidistant in @xmath50 , and 10000  gev@xmath32 ( dashed ) .",
    "for @xmath39 only the first and last ones are shown .    in fig .",
    "2b we plot the calculated lowest order , leading twist pqcd evolution for the ratio @xmath5 at different fixed values of @xmath16 , and compare the results directly with the corresponding data of nmc @xcite .",
    "the agreement is very good .",
    "note that in order to reduce the potential gluon fusion @xcite effects in the evolution as much as possible , we have chosen the initial scale above 1 gev but below the @xmath51-threshold in order to make the treatment of the initial state as simple as possible .",
    "the @xmath50 slopes of @xmath52 , and also of the ratio @xmath1 , can be used to constrain the gluon distributions @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , however , the values of @xmath16 of the nmc data @xcite are not quite small enough to get a firm handle on the initial nuclear shadowing of gluons .",
    "we have also repeated the analysis by using the cteq4l parton distributions @xcite as the basis @xcite .",
    "note that in cteq4l the sea is more flavour - asymmetric than in grvlo , and that there are less gluons in cteq4l at very small values of @xmath16 .",
    "the nuclear ratios @xmath53 for each flavour of partons were , however , found to deviate at most a few per cents relative to those computed with grvlo .",
    "we therefore conclude that to a good first approximation @xmath54 , where `` set '' refers to any modern lowest order set of parton distributions for the free proton , and where @xmath55 does _ not _ depend on the set .    for practical applications of computing hard cross sections in high energy nuclear collisions ,",
    "we have also prepared a parametrization of the nuclear ratios @xmath7 for each parton flavour @xmath8 in any nucleus @xmath9 , at @xmath10 and @xmath56 .",
    "the parametrization is intended for general use , and it is available from us via email , or from http://fpaxp1.usc.es/phenom/ or from http://www.urhic.phys.jyu.fi/.    finally , we note that our analysis can be improved in obvious ways : more quantitative error analysis must be implemented , next - to - leading order dglap evolution must be done , the initial gluon distributions and gluon fusion corrections @xcite must be studied in more detail ."
