    "one can note the appearance of casimir forces between parallel conducting plates and phenomena of vacuum polarization leading to photon - photon scattering in vacuum due to creation of virtual electron - positron pair .    since the original calculations of the value of the lamb shift by bethe and later by feynman and others , the theory of radiative corrections has been worked out up to a very high precision .",

    "however , the advances in the engineering of micro- and nanoelectromechanical systems , optical microcavities , superconducting circuits and artificial atoms made actual the problem of the investigation of quantum vacuum effects in these nanodevices . in this context",
    ", the lamb shift has been observed in a superconducting electronic circuit in the form of a superconducting cooper pair box in a transmission - line resonator @xcite .",

    "we consider a general case of the quantum ring pierced by the magnetic flux @xmath34 .",
    "the vector - potential is chosen as @xmath35 , where r is the radius of a ring , and electron momentum operator is @xmath36 .",

    "we restrict ourself to the calculation of the non - relativistic part of the lamb shift . in this way , the standard calculations including also the electron mass renormalization procedure lead to the following result ( @xmath88 ) : @xmath89 where @xmath1 is fine structure constant and @xmath87 is the cut - off parameter and the matrix elements of transitions are calculated in sec .",

    "the analogous procedure can not be realized for the dipole version @xmath92 of the interaction because in this case the formula ( [ eshift ] ) also contains additional divergences .",
    "note that eq .",

    "it is easy to realize assuming that the propagator of confined electron differs from the propagator of free electron ( see fig .",

    "the behaviour of aharonov - bohm oscillations in the lamb shift is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , where for convenience we introduced a characteristic energy @xmath110 .",

    "we observe that the radiative shift dependence on the magnetic flux has maximum and minimum .",
    "in particular , the minima appear at the points @xmath116 .",
    "we find that lamb shift is approximately equal to characteristic energy @xmath113 for small magnetic flux , but substantially grows for higher magnetic fields .",
    "moreover , we find that the effect of vacuum corrections is larger for a quantum rings of smaller radius .",

    "for the given parameters the characteristic energy is equal to @xmath119 fev , and @xmath120ev .",
    "note , that for typical parameters of the semiconductor rings the values of the shifts are extremely small and lie in the range of nanoelectronvolts .",
    "however , one can expect that the shift will be dramatically increased in organic ring - shaped molecules , such as benzene , cycloalkanes and porphyrins , for which the value of the radius can become of the order of nanometers .",
    "our estimation gives that for benzene ring of radius @xmath121 nm the characteristic energy is @xmath122ev .",
    "thus , even for small values of piercing magnetic flux the lamb shift riches microelectronvolt range .",

    ", the characteristic energy can be estimated as @xmath126 nev , leading to the lamb shift which is order of magnitude smaller than in benzene case .      for completeness , we now shortly analyse the case of quantum 1d ring pierced by the magnetic flux and interacting with single mode in a cavity @xcite .",
    "we calculate the shift of @xmath6-energetic level due to emission and reabsorption of virtual photons of one - mode cavity by using the @xmath91 version of electron - radiation field interaction .",

    "the lamb shift physically appears due to the emission and reabsorption of the virtual photons .",
    "the corresponding correction to the energy in the case of 2d ring can be divided into two parts : @xmath143 the `` diagonal '' part @xmath144 contains the terms in which the absorption of the virtual photon does not change the principal number @xmath145 , while azimuthal number changes by @xmath146 .",
    "only these terms were accounted for the case of 1d ring .",
    "however , the rings of the final width include `` non - diagonal '' contribution to the lamb shift given by @xmath147 . in this term",
    "the absorption of virtual photon changes the value of @xmath145 , and thus the term involves the summation over intermediate states @xmath148 .    below we consider a narrow ring , without magnetic flux , in which width @xmath99 is much less than the radius of the ring , @xmath149 . in this case",
    "the characteristic confinement energy of the radial motion @xmath150 is much greater than the spacing between azimuthal energy levels @xmath151 .",

    "the value of the diagonal contribution to the lamb shift thus coincides with earlier obtained result for purely 1d ring .",
    "it should be mentioned that consideration of the simplest form of the potential ( [ parabolic ] ) and the approximate solution ( [ r0rho ] ) of the radial equation ( [ shrrad ] ) prove to be correct for estimation of the effective radius of ring .",
    "however , such approximation in principle is not fully correct .",
    "note , also that in general 1d ring should be considered as the limit of a narrow 2d ring .",
    "however , this procedure can be only performed in details for each of the given confined potential , but not in the general form .",
    "some examples have been described in @xcite    in the end of this section we provide the other approach that allows to estimate the lamb shift using eq .",

    "<S> we study the vacuum radiative corrections to energy levels of a confined electron in quantum rings . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations are provided for the lamb shift of energy levels in low - momentum region of virtual photons and for both one - dimensional and two - dimensional quantum rings . </S>",
    "<S> we show that contrary to the well known case of a hydrogen atom the value of the lamb shift increases with the magnetic momentum quantum number _ </S>",
    "<S> m_. we also investigate the dependence of the lamb shift on magnetic flux piercing the ring and demonstrate a presence of magnetic - flux - dependent oscillations . for one - dimensional ring </S>",
    "<S> the value of the shift strongly depends on the radius of the ring . </S>",
    "<S> it is small for semiconductor rings but can attain measurable quantities in natural organic ring - shape molecules , such as benzene , cycloalcanes and porphyrins . </S>"
