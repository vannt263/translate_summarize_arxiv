    "the commonly accepted model explaining the power source for active galactic nuclei ( agns ) is a massive black hole fed by an accretion disk .",
    "the advantage of this model is the high efficiency of conversion of gravitational energy to radiant energy , but the main difficulty is the removal of angular momentum . unlike stars , which constitute a dissipationless",
    "medium , gas and dust can lose orbital energy and angular momentum through collisions and shocks . at least in seyfert galaxies , but probably in all agns , the host galaxy reserves a mass of neutral ism comparable to or exceeding the lifetime needs of the agn . except in galaxy clusters ,",
    "the mass of the hot phase component of the ism is insufficient to fuel the most luminous agns over their duration .",
    "although the transport mechanism remains a mystery , the conventional model holds that agns are powered by neutral ism removed from the host galaxy ( e.g. , ) .",
    "important variants on the standard model are the unifying schemes for agns .",
    "the dust associated with the neutral ism can obscure a range of sight - lines to the agn , affecting its outward appearance .",
    "it is proposed that both broad - line ( e.g. , seyfert 1 ) and narrow - line ( seyfert 2 ) agns are identical , but the broad - line region ( blr ) of seyfert 2 galaxies may be obscured by a dusty ring , viewed more nearly edge - on , surrounding the active nucleus ( this model is reviewed in , e.g. , ; ; ) .",
    "there are a handful of hidden seyfert  1 galaxies discovered by spectropolarimetry ( e.g. , ; ; ) , but it is not clear whether the model is generally applicable .",
    "the detection of relatively high x - ray obscuring columns towards seyfert 2 nuclei warrants the question of the nature and scale of the obscuring medium ( e.g. , ; ; ; ; ) .",
    "we have observed a sample of 13 radio - bright seyfert galaxies in ( 21  cm ) absorption to explore the distribution and kinematics of the neutral ism in the vicinity of the agn .",
    "there are two primary advantages of this technique .",
    "first , absorption lines are potentially more sensitive than emission lines , the former limited primarily by the brightness of the background source rather than the column density or emission measure of the gas .",
    "second , one can use powerful aperture synthesis arrays to resolve the absorption line gas on scales as small as the background radio source ( i.e. , potentially down to sub - parsec scales ) .",
    "conversely , although the absorption experiment may not resolve the background source , the structure of the background source may be known from independent continuum studies , and so the effective resolution of the absorption experiment is improved .",
    "a third advantage is that one knows for certain that the absorption line gas must lie in front of the background source , removing the ambiguity suffered by emission line studies .",
    "of course , the primary limitation is that one can detect and resolve absorption line gas only to the extent of the background source .",
    "in addition , because the opacity is inversely proportional to the excitation temperature , absorption lines are weighted more heavily by colder clouds .",

    "the selection criteria for this survey were spiral galaxies with evidence for nuclear activity and radio brightness @xmath1  mjy as resolved by the vla a - array .",
    "in essence this survey is a radio flux - limited sample comprising mainly seyfert galaxy nuclei .",
    "our original survey consisted of 24 active spirals , but owing to a technical problem with our first observation ( vla program ab  605 on 19 jul 1991 ) , we were unable to recover the  spectra for these sources .",
    "we received a reduced time allocation for a repeat observation on 22 nov 1992 .",
    "time and lst constraints reduced our sample to a subset of 13 of the brightest sources ( vla program ab  658 ) .",
    "we observed the sample galaxies with the vla operating in its a - configuration , i.e. , the longest baseline configuration , with baselines ranging from @xmath2170  k@xmath3 at 21  cm .",
    "the spatial resolutions in the image plane are typically @xmath42 . a summary of the main observing parameters are provided in table  [ obsparms ] .",
    "receivers were tuned to the appropriately redshifted wavelength of the  21  cm line ( rest frequency @xmath5  mhz ) .",

    "the channel widths are @xmath6  , and , accounting for channel overlaps between the if pairs , the total bandwidth is @xmath7  .",
    "the two remaining sources ( ngc 2992 and ngc 5506 ) were observed using 1a mode covering a single bandpass of 6.25  mhz , again with channel widths of @xmath8  .",
    "source observations interleaved with shorter scans of a point - source calibrator for phase referencing .",
    "each source observation was accompanied by a scan of a bright flux standard , either 3c  48 or 3c  286 .",
    "we also used these sources for bandpass calibration to remove the residual channel - to - channel complex gain variations .",
    "we reduced the data using standard procedures in aips .",
    "the flux scale was set by scans of the radio continuum standards 3c  48 and 3c  286 , defined according to .",
    "absolute calibration of interferometric phase was determined by point source models for the phase reference calibrators .",
    "we then employed 23 iterations of self - calibration on each of our targets , properly including all of the confusing sources brighter than 5  mjy within two primary beam widths .",
    "the final clean - deconvolved models were subtracted from the @xmath9 database .",
    "we generated spectral - line cubes for each target by fourier transform .",
    "the cubes were inspected for residual continuum emission or bandpass gradient not subtracted by the clean - component model . for stronger sources",
    ", we subtracted a linear fit to the spectral baseline , but for weaker sources it sufficed to remove a continuum mean .",
    "all residual subtractions were performed in the image ( i.e. , not @xmath10 ) plane .",
    "a possible source of error in this experiment is a bandpass calibration artifact resulting from temperature variations , and hence length variations , of the waveguide system at the vla (; ) .",
    "the signature is a sinusoidal ripple with a period of 3  mhz , matching the bandwidth used in this experiment . among the sources observed for this experiment , only the nuclear spectrum of ngc  1068 displayed broad spectral features that could be explained by the 3  mhz ripple . to test for this artifact",
    ", we generated a spectrum of the phase calibrator for ngc  1068 .",
    "the phase calibrator showed similar spectral structure , corresponding to a spectral dynamic range of @xmath11 .",

    "the only published survey comparable to the present one is dickey s ( 1986 ) non - imaging vla survey of radio bright spiral and irregular galaxies . accepting the small number statistics , our detection rate ( 69% ) is better than dickey s ( 53% ) .",
    "the most likely explanation is a @xmath12 improvement in sensitivity rather than sample selection .",
    "for example , our survey contains a greater fraction of agns relative to star - forming nuclei , but isolating the subsample of agns within dickey s survey does not increase the detection rate .",
    "explicity , nineteen sources were surveyed in , including 11 seyfert or liner nuclei and one bl lac ; rapid star - formation may dominate the radio continuum emission in the remaining sources .",
    "dickey detected 10 out of 19 ( 53% ) galaxies , or @xmath13 accounting for 5 additional , but marginal , detections .",
    "the statistics are comparable for the subsample of seyfert and liner nuclei : 5 ( @xmath14 marginal ) out of 12 were detected , for a detection rate of 42% ( @xmath15 ) . furthermore , the distribution of continuum source brightnesses are similar between the present survey and .",
    "the improved flux sensitivity of the present survey constitutes an improvement in optical depth sensitivity .",
    "an example is the starburst nucleus ngc  3504 , which was detected marginally in but is clearly detected in our survey .",
    "the column density @xmath16 and spin ( excitation ) temperature @xmath17 are related to the observed  absorption spectrum according to : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is in units , and @xmath20 is the opacity measured against the background continuum . in order to derive  column densities , we need some handle on the excitation state of the absorbing gas",
    ".    there are three factors controlling the spin temperature of neutral hydrogen (; ; ): collisions , pumping by ly-@xmath21 photons , and the absorption of 21  cm continuum radiation .",
    "the spin temperature approaches the kinetic temperature @xmath22 in collisionally dominated ( high density ) regions .",
    "absorption columns through dense clouds in galaxy disks typically match the  emission columns for a spin temperature of @xmath23300  k , close to the expected @xmath22 ( e.g. , ; ; ; ) .",
    "however , radiative effects are expected to be important in the neighborhood of an agn , @xcite , and @xmath22 is a _ lower _",
    "limit for @xmath17 .",
    "[ fig - tspin ] demonstrates the effects of 21  cm absorption and ly-@xmath21 pumping of the ground state of  in the 100  pc scale environment of a seyfert nucleus ( compare with fig .  5 in ) .",
    "for illustration , we modeled the 21  cm radiative effects using the nuclear properties of ngc  4151 .",
    "the background radio sources have a brightness temperature @xmath24  k at 21  cm ( e.g. , ; ) , and the specific luminosity of the continuum near ly-@xmath21 is @xmath25 ergs s  hz  @xcite .",
    "in computing the density of ly-@xmath21 photons we further assumed a distance of 50  pc between the continuum source and the absorbing  cloud .",
    "a distance of 50  pc usually falls within the range of the observed , deprojected distances between the radio nuclei and  absorbing regions ( see  [ models ] ) .",
    "we find that , in the 100  pc vicinity of an agn , ly-@xmath21 pumping or 21  cm absorption controls @xmath17 for densities",
    "@xmath26  cm , but @xmath17 settles asymptotically to @xmath22 for @xmath27  cm  as collisions dominate the excitation of the ground state .    note that fig .",
    "[ fig - tspin ] is representative for typical seyfert jets .",
    "a few seyferts , however , have a bright self - absorbed core ; mrk  348 is an example .",
    "the intense radiation field near a self - absorbed radio core strongly affects @xmath28 ( e.g. , bahcall & ekers 1969 ) , and this effect may suppress  absorption from an obscuring torus .",
    "we consider this possibility in more detail in  [ exciteme ] .    for most of the seyferts in this survey ,",
    "the  absorbed regions cover radii comparable , in projection , to the size of the nlr , and   absorption might plausibly arise from neutral filaments embedded within or shadowed by nlr plasma . since @xmath29 ,",
    "absorption studies are particularly sensitive to gas that is cold both thermally and kinematically .",
    "we would therefore expect most of the  absorption to arise from the coldest regions of clouds where hydrogen is primarily atomic . in agn - irradiated clouds ,",
    "the kinetic temperature of the cold atomic region is @xmath30  k @xcite .",
    "if we assume pressure equilibrium and typical nlr conditions @xmath31  k and @xmath32  cm  @xcite , the density of the cold atomic region is @xmath33  cm . at this",
    "limit collisions dominate , and @xmath34 ( fig .  [ fig - tspin ] ) .",
    "we conclude that  absorption from the nlr region of seyfert galaxies probably arise from the cold dense regions where @xmath35  k. this result is remarkable in that @xmath17 in cold galactic clouds is also @xmath36  k , and so the conventional assumption @xmath37  k holds up under a broad range of conditions",
    ". of course , there may be situations where  absorption traces a warmer atomic medium in the agn environment ; for example , the sight - line to the radio source may not cross the cold neutral region . in the warm atomic region",
    "@xmath22 ( and @xmath17 ) can elevate to several 1000  k before hydrogen is significantly ionized @xcite .",
    "the assumption of @xmath37  k therefore provides a lower limit to the true  column .",
    "we derived the column densities of the absorbing  according to eqn .",
    "[ eq - nh ] and assuming a spin temperature @xmath37  k. the measured columns are listed in table  [ hiprops ] .",
    "the absorption opacity @xmath38 was measured against channel - averaged continuum images from the same data set .",
    "confusion between continuum sources can dilute the measured opacities or , equivalently , the  absorbing gas might not completely cover an unresolved background source .",
    "the reported values of @xmath16 are therefore lower limits to the true absorbing column .",
    "the columns for mkn  6 , ngc  4151 , and mkn  231 are derived from published merlin and vlba observations (; ; ) .",
    "one concern of this study is whether the  absorbing gas is peculiar to the small - scale agn environment or arises from the disk of the host galaxy on larger scales . addressing this question , a simple prediction would be that the  absorption should show no trend with inclination , since agn disks appear to be oriented randomly with respect to outer galaxy disks ( e.g. , ; ) .",

    ", we also plot the range of galactic  absorbing columns observed towards extragalactic radio sources @xcite and the radio source sgr  a in the galactic center @xcite .",
    "we can draw two conclusions from fig .",
    "[ nh - vs - inc ] .",
    "first , running counter to the prediction for agn disks , there is evidence for a trend in  column with host galaxy inclination .",
    "for instance , all four sources with @xmath39 are detected in  absorption .",
    "we computed correlation statistics for the regression of @xmath16 on @xmath40 using standard survival analysis techniques to account for the non - detections .",
    "the results indicate a real trend in @xmath41 with @xmath42 : the probability for no correlation is 2.7% for kendall",
    "s generalized @xmath38 , @xmath43 for cox s proportional hazard model , and 4.6% for spearman s generalized @xmath44 ( although we caution that spearman s @xmath44 is not reliable for sample sizes @xmath45 ) .",
    "this result suggests that in many seyferts  absorption arises in gaseous disks at least aligned with , if not cospatial with , the kiloparsec - scale galaxy disks .",
    "we caution that the trend is only valid for the quantity @xmath46 , but a significant spread in @xmath28 would reduce confidence in the trend of @xmath16 with inclination .",
    "nevertheless , we demonstrate in  [ models ] that the kinematics and distribution of the  absorption line gas are also consistent with the observed trend .",
    "the second conclusion is that the typical absorbing columns towards detected seyfert galaxies exceed the galactic columns by factors ranging from @xmath4730 , although there is some overlap for individual seyfert galaxies and galactic absorbing clouds .",
    "the mean face - on column for detected seyferts is @xmath48  cm , exceeding galaxy columns by a factor of nearly 10",
    ". it would be interesting to compare the seyfert  columns with a larger sample of non - active galaxies , but , lacking bright radio sources , non - active galaxies are not readily studied in  absorption .",
    "nevertheless , based on   emission studies , the face - on columns through spiral galaxies are typically a few times @xmath49  cm  ( e.g. , surveys include the theses of ; ; ; their associated publications ; and ) .",
    "typical  emission columns of normal spiral galaxies are comparable to the absorption columns measured for the galaxy rotated to a face - on view .",
    "the observed enhancement of  column towards seyfert nuclei is probably not an excitation effect .",
    "demonstrated above in  [ tspin ] , the measured columns are lower limits because 21  cm absorption and ly-@xmath21 pumping in the vicinity of an agn can raise @xmath17 to 1000  k or more .",
    "in contrast all of the galactic values have been corrected for directly measured spin temperatures ( for the galactic center column we assumed @xmath50  k in the 10  pc diameter disk after and references therein ) .",
    "furthermore , owing to proximity ,  absorbing clouds in the galaxy are better resolved compared to  absorption towards seyfert nuclei .",
    "therefore , the galaxy columns suffer less continuum dilution owing to confusion or covering fraction arguments .",
    "we conservatively conclude that the  absorption columns towards seyfert nuclei exceed the  columns in the galaxy , and perhaps other non - active spiral galaxies , by a factor of at least six ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ nh - vs - inc ] ) .",
    "we show in  [ models ] that  absorption in seyfert galaxies usually traces  disks in the inner kiloparsec .",
    "in contrast ,   columns are often reduced below detectability in the inner kiloparsec of nearby , non - active spirals ( e.g. , ; ) .",
    "limited by instrumental sensitivity , the central columns are typically @xmath51  cm , where @xmath52 is the beam covering fraction of the  gas .",
    "the high detection rate for seyfert nuclei argues for @xmath52 approaching unity .",
    "based on the interpretation of  [ models ] , it appears that the  surface density in the inner kiloparsec of seyfert and starburst galaxies exceeds by a factor @xmath53 the   columns in the centers of non - active galaxies .",
    "we discuss this result further in  [ fueling ] .",
    "x - rays provide another measure of the column of material obscuring the central engine in active galaxies .",
    "photoelectric absorption by foreground gas that is",
    "not fully ionized attenuates the soft x - ray continuum spectrum of the central engine .",
    "the simplest models for agn x - ray spectra usually involve a power law continuum modified by photoelectric absorption through the galaxy and photoelectric absorption intrinsic to the source . the absorption is commonly parameterized by a total hydrogen column adopting standard cross sections and abundances ( e.g. , ) .",
    "table  [ tab - cx ] lists the x - ray absorption columns available in the literature for sources in the combined survey .",
    "there are often several models for a given source , and predictably the absorption column becomes poorly constrained as models become more complex . in each case , we selected the simplest model that provides a reasonable fit and the best constraints on an absorption column . selecting",
    "models in this way tended to err on the side of caution ; that is , more sophisticated models often give larger measures for the x - ray photoelectric column .",
    "the conclusions of this section are not affected by the selection of the simplest x - ray spectral models .",
    "[ fig - c21cx ] compares the 21  cm absorption columns with the x - ray absorption columns . under the hypothesis that the radio and x - ray nuclei are effectively cospatial , the prediction is a correlation between the 21  cm and x - ray columns .",
    "in addition , one would also expect that the x - ray columns should tend to be slightly greater than the 21  cm columns , since 21  cm absorption is not sensitive to the presence of hydrogen locked in molecules or partially ionized gas .",
    "we find no measurable correlation between 21  cm and x - ray absorption columns , and the columns match reasonably only for mrk  231 .",
    "for most ( 8 out of 11 ) of the sources , the x - ray column exceeds the 21  cm column by at least an order of magnitude .",
    "we refer to these sources as having a `` photoelectric excess '' of absorption .",
    "there are three explanations for photoelectric excesses .",
    "first , it may be that most of the hydrogen is in molecular or ionized form .",
    "alternatively , it may be that the primary x - ray absorber is dust , and the obscuring material has a lower gas - to - dust ratio than assumed in the modeling .",
    "the former explanation seems most likely for the seyfert 1 nuclei , in which it appears that the absorbing medium is ionized ( e.g. , ; ) .",
    "the second explanation is that the radio emission may not be cospatial with the nuclear x - ray source , and so x - ray absorption and 21  cm absorption may probe different regions of the foreground media .",
    "we consider this possibility further in ",
    "[ schemes ] . the third explanation might be spin temperature effects .",
    "increasing @xmath28 to @xmath54  k would produce a better agreement between x - ray and 21  cm columns for mrk  6 , ngc  2110 , ngc  4151 , and ngc  5506 , and the remaining photoelectric excess sources require @xmath55  k to explain the discrepancy .",
    "this explanation fails , however , to explain the result that  absorption tends to avoid the nucleus in those seyferts where the radio jet is resolved (  [ models ] , below ) .",
    "it seems more likely that 21  cm absorption does not trace the same gas giving rise to the soft x - ray opacity .",
    "the sources ngc  2992 and ngc  3079 show a `` photoelectric deficit , '' meaning that the 21  cm absorption column exceeds the x - ray photoelectric column .",
    "again , it may be that the abundances assumed for the x - ray modeling are incorrect .",
    "for example , in this case , the gas - to - dust ratio may be _ higher _ than was assumed for the x - ray spectral modeling .",
    "the host galaxies of both sources are edge - on , and both show evidence for extended soft x - ray emission ( e.g. , ; ; ) .",
    "the spatial resolution of the soft x - ray spectra is very coarse , @xmath56 , much larger than the vla beam . an alternative explanation ,",
    "then , might be that extended x - ray emission dilutes the soft x - ray columns towards the nucleus .",
    "the extended emission that is resolved by current x - ray satellites is only @xmath5720% of the total , insufficient to explain the photoelectric deficits .",
    "dilution of the soft x - ray columns would require extended x - ray emission on sub - arcminute scales not yet resolved ; future x - ray satellites will have sufficient resolution to test the hypothesis .",
    "we conclude that there is no correlation between x - ray photoelectric columns and 21  cm columns .",
    "although there are a number of possible explanations , the simplest explanation may be that the radio and x - ray sources are not cospatial , and so 21  cm absorption and soft x - ray absorption do not ( usually ) trace the same foreground gas .",
    "we consider the implications in more detail in the following discussion ( particularly  [ schemes ] , below ) .",
    "there are now a handful of seyfert nuclei in which the  absorption is resolved against the background radio source : mkn  6 ( this study ; ) , mkn  231 ( ) , ngc  1068 ( this study , fig .",

    "the remaining detections that we have imaged , but in which the   absorption is not well resolved against the background continuum , are ngc  3504 and ngc  5506 .",
    "it is remarkable that the  absorption tends to avoid the radio nucleus .",
    "more typically , the absorption is displaced by @xmath58  pc in projection away from the central radio source ( table  [ hiprops ] ) .",
    "the exceptions are ngc  3079 and ngc  5506 , which are edge - on , and ngc  4151 , in which the  absorbing gas lies within a few tens of parsecs of the central engine @xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated that detections are more likely with increasing inclination of the host galaxy (  [ nh ] ; fig .",
    "[ nh - vs - inc ] ; see also ) .",
    "moreover , the inferred absorption columns are not correlated with estimates of the x - ray absorption column (  [ xray ] ) .",
    "it appears that   absorption in seyfert and starburst nuclei traces gas in the inner disk of the host galaxy rather than gas associated with the agn .",
    "in particular , the  absorption does not appear to be associated with a parsec - scale obscuring torus , with ngc  4151 being an important exception .    to test this conclusion , we modeled the kinematics of the   absorbing gas as disks in circular rotation .",
    "we spatially resolve the kinematics only in ngc  1068 @xcite , and so had to fit disk models to global absorption line profiles rather than spatially resolved channel maps .",
    "the results are listed in table  [ t - diskfits ] and displayed in figs .",
    "[ mkn6norm][n5506norm ] .",
    "the disk models were computed and fit as follows .",

    "for ngc  4151 we constructed a continuum model based on vlbi observations @xcite , which recover all of the continuum flux in the merlin maps around the region of the  absorption @xcite .",
    "we next generated a model disk described by vertical column density @xmath59 ; rotational velocity @xmath60 ; velocity dispersion @xmath61 , fixed at @xmath62  , as is commonly observed in spiral galaxy disks ( e.g. , ) ; scale height @xmath63 , fixed at 10  pc , self - consistent with the measured rotation velocities and disk radii ; and , particularly for edge - on galaxies , inner and outer annular radii @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the scale height @xmath63 for ngc  4151 was fixed at 0.1  pc because of the small radial scale of the absorbing disk .",
    "we also fitted the rotation curve as a power law @xmath66 , but , in every case , @xmath67 , meaning an essentially flat rotation curve over the measured region .    since the hypothesis to be tested is whether the  absorption traces normal disk gas , the inclination @xmath42 and kinematic major axis @xmath68 were fixed to those values observed in the outer disk of the host galaxy in question .",
    "for ngc  1068 , we took into account the rotation of the kinematic axis by 45  between the outer and inner galaxy .",
    "the apparent cause of this rotation is streaming in the central stellar bar @xcite . lacking spatial information , except for ngc  1068 , we further assumed that the absorbing  uniformly fills the disk . in each case where the absorption is displaced from the nucleus",

    "we assumed that the best - fit model line profile was the correct profile , and added random , gaussian noise to the model spectrum to simulate an observed spectrum .",

    "we repeated the fitting procedure on a series of ten simulated line profiles .",

    "the models are not unique in the sense that one can always contrive a model where all of the gas is falling into or flowing away from the background radio source . on the other hand ,",
    "the structure of the background radio source leaves a `` fingerprint '' on the absorption profile that promotes the uniqueness of the fitted parameters of the disk model .",
    "that is , the structure of the background source will preferentially enhance or suppress the contribution of certain velocities to the spatially integrated line profile .",
    "an important failing is that our models can not fit for spatially varying opacity in the absorbing gas because plausible opacity variations , such as spiral arm structure , require too many parameters for the fits to be meaningful .",
    "nevertheless , the uniform disk model produces a reasonable and illustrative fit for all of the observed line profiles .    one potential artifact of the fitting is a parsec - scale inner radius for the absorbing disk .",

    "any discrete , residual components always arise within the velocity range traced by the model disk profile .",
    "we therefore suspect that unresolved opacity variations in the foreground disk may give rise to the discrete features in the line profile .",
    "for example , the spectrum of ngc  5506 shows a discrete redshifted component ( fig .",
    "[ n5506norm ] ) that might arise from a cold cloud in the main disk which happens to fall along the line - of - sight .    to demonstrate the validity of the galaxy disk model , we point to the peculiar absorption line profile of ngc  2110 ( fig .",
    "[ n2110norm ] ) .",
    "the absorption line is redshifted from systemic by nearly 300  , and the traditional interpretation would be infall towards the galaxy nucleus . however , the vla images reveal that the absorbing gas is displaced from the nucleus along the kinematic major axis . because of the special , chance alignment of the kinematic major axis and the radio jet , the northern lobe of the jet back - illuminates receding disk gas , and",
    "the result is a redshifted line profile .",
    "the uniform disk model reasonably reproduces the line profile shape , lending credence to this interpretation .",
    "the lack of a blue - shifted absorption line against the opposing , southern radio lobe indicates that the jet points in front of the disk to the south .",
    "ngc  4151 represents a special case , since the  absorption probably traces gas within the inner few tens of parsecs of the nucleus .",
    "unfortunately , the location of the nucleus in the radio reference frame is not known , since all of the compact continuum sources are steep spectrum ( e.g. , comparing and ) . since the  absorbed component ( c4 )",
    "is also free - free absorbed , and since the radio jet and nlr probably point toward us west of c4 , the nucleus is probably near and west of c4 @xcite .",
    "we selected the central vlbi component c4w as the location of the nucleus after .",
    "discussed below , this placement only affects the quantitative results of the model but does not alter the qualitative conclusions .",
    "the radio jet of ngc  4151 does not align with the minor axis of the host galaxy , and so the agn disk and galaxy disks are also misaligned .",
    "we therefore tried two disk models for ngc  4151 , one with an orientation matching the host galaxy @xcite , and one matching the inferred properties of an agn disk @xcite .",
    "the agn disk model fits the absorption spectrum better than the galaxy disk model .",
    "the reason is that the   absorption line centers very near the systemic velocity , and the agn disk model places the  absorbing gas along the disk minor axis .",
    "the galaxy disk model , on the other hand , predicts a slightly redshifted absorption component , since the absorption occurs towards the receding axis . as a result",
    ", the galaxy disk model requires counter - rotation to fit the observed  profiles .",
    "these conclusions hold so long as the radio jet originates at the kinematical center of the galaxy ; the kinematical center may be placed anywhere along the radio jet and an agn disk will always fit the absorption spectrum better than the galaxy disk model .      to look for evidence of infall that might fuel the agn",
    ", we repeated the disk model fits allowing for a radial component to the gas velocity .",
    "the best - fit streaming velocities are listed in table  [ t - stream ] .",
    "the trivial , but unrealistic , solution would have been to set the rotational velocity to zero and assume purely radial motions . to avoid the trivial solution , we initialized the iterative fitting procedure with the parameters from the purely rotational model and allowed the circular and radial velocities to relax into a local minimum for @xmath70 .    although the error - bars are usually large relative to the fitted values , all of the streaming velocities are radially inward towards the nucleus except for ngc  1068 and ngc  4151 .",
    "the deprojected infall velocities are typically a few tens of .",
    "looking at the exceptions , the  absorbed region of ngc  1068 traces gas mainly on the trailing side of the central stellar bar @xcite , over which the mean radial velocity of gas is expected to be away from the nucleus ( e.g. , ; ) .",
    "although the streaming velocities in ngc  1068 are very uncertain , the implied outward streaming is consistent with the predicted bar streaming .",
    "it is all but impossible to interpret the outflowing gas motions in ngc  4151 since the absorption is not yet resolved against the vlbi structure .",
    "an important caveat is the main failing of these disk models ; namely , we can not recreate the distribution of absorbing gas as a function of galactic coordinates .",
    "a localized enhancement of foreground column covering a finite range of radial velocities can mimic enhanced velocity dispersion or streaming velocities .",
    "three - dimensional ( @xmath21 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 ) models of the spectral line cubes would add enough information to allow at least a crude treatment on the spatial distribution of  absorbing gas , but the present data generally lack the spatial resolution for three - dimensional fits to be effective .",
    "the fitted streaming velocities can be viewed as upper limits to the true radial motions on @xmath36  pc scales .    accepting this caveat ,",
    "the upper limits on the mass deposition rates constrain the luminosity that can be powered by the  disks .",
    "one concern , for example , is whether the upper limits on the infall rates might be insufficient to power the central engine .",
    "we have included in table  [ t - stream ] the mass infall rates estimated by @xmath77 ; typical values are a few @xmath78  yr . among the  detections presented here , the mean , infall rate is @xmath79  yr .",
    "this rate can support a nuclear luminosity of @xmath80  ergs s , where @xmath81 is the efficiency factor for mass - energy conversion in the accretion disk .",
    "this luminosity defines the traditional seyfert / qso luminosity boundary , and so the inferred mass deposition rates are comparable to that required to fuel seyfert nuclei .",
    "we caution that this result does not constitute proof of infalling gas on 100  pc scales . on the other hand",
    ", we may conclude that the kinematics of the  absorption are compatible with the standard model for agns , namely , that the active nucleus is fueled by gas removed from the host galaxy disk .",
    "we should point out that the nature of the  absorption in active spirals appears to be very different from the  absorption in active ellipticals .",
    "apart from a substantially lower detection rate , found that the  absorption lines were never blue - shifted , indicating either tangential motion or radial infall towards the central radio source .",

    "current and future millimeter surveys , such as that currently taking place at the bima telescope ( e.g. , ) , may better address the stability issue in other seyfert galaxies .",
    "perhaps the most surprising result of this survey is the lack of absorption towards the agn in seyfert nuclei , particularly those known to harbor a heavily obscured central engine .",
    "the trivial explanation is that the central x - ray sources are radio - silent .",
    "however , the well - known hidden seyfert 1 nuclei are also the most luminous seyfert galaxies at radio wavelengths @xcite , and it seems unlikely that the most luminous radio seyferts contain radio - silent agns .",

    "this is certainly the case for ngc  1068 ( e.g. , ) and mkn  231 @xcite , for example .    further motivating this hypothesis ,",

    "the paucity of obvious radio cores in seyfert nuclei ( e.g. , ) , even relatively radio - bright seyfert nuclei , also argues for free - free suppression of the seyfert radio nuclei .",
    "we next demonstrate that the condition of free - free absorption places limits on the scale of the free - free obscuring plasma , which in turn limits the inner radius for neutral gas in the obscuring torus . for a given free - free opacity ( i.e. , emission measure ) ,",
    "the free - free radio continuum flux and hydrogen recombination line flux scale with the projected surface area of the free - free absorbing plasma .",

    "this limit also assumes that the brightness temperature is equal to the electron temperature , appropriate for optically thick thermal plasma .",
    "since , at 1  resolution , any free - free emission from the obscuring torus would probably be confused with synchrotron emission from the jet , we are limited not by the continuum sensitivity but rather the  absorption line sensitivity .",
    "( as new vlbi maps of seyfert galaxies are published , continuum constraints on putative free - free absorbing regions may tighten the constraints argued here ) .",
    "x - ray absorbing columns of @xmath106  cm  ( e.g. , table  [ tab - cx ] ) produce an  opacity of @xmath107 , where @xmath108  k and @xmath109 is the line - width in units of 100  . a nuclear free - free continuum source would be completely attenuated over the 21  cm line profile , and the limit on the agn radio continuum flux is therefore the detection limit for a single channel , or roughly 3  mjy for this experiment . @xmath110 based on the ratio of seyfert 1 to seyfert 2 galaxies @xcite .",
    "applying these values , the obscuring plasma must be smaller than @xmath111  pc , or else the background radio continuum provided by thermal free - free emission would produce an observable  absorption line .",
    "we next consider the hydrogen recombination line luminosity of the free - free obscuring region .",
    "we choose to consider hydrogen recombination lines mainly for ease of computation ; consideration of forbidden line emission would require a photoionization model , which is beyond the scope of this work . without loss of generality , we consider only h@xmath21 line emission .",
    "since , according to unifying schemes , the ionized region of the torus would not be obscured by dust in seyfert  1 galaxies , the spatially - integrated h@xmath21 luminosities of the nlr provide an upper limit to the emission from the obscuring region . for seyfert galaxies , the median nlr h@xmath21 luminosity is @xmath112  ergs s  ( based on characteristic line ratios in and observed h@xmath113 luminosities from ) .",
    "taking the usual assumption of case - b recombination , the size of the free - free obscuring region must be : @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the free - free opacity at the 21  cm rest wavelength , and we have used the usual radio approximation for the free - free opacity law from .",
    "if free - free suppression of the nuclear continuum source commonly occurs in seyfert nuclei , as is at least suggested by this   absorption experiment , the implication is that the obscuring torus can not be much larger than a few tens of parsecs . turning the argument around",
    ", we would not predict substantial free - free absorption from a 100  pc scale obscuring torus ; rather , we would have expected strong  absorption against a bright continuum source .",
    "the third way to suppress  absorption is to raise the spin temperature , dropping the opacity for a given foreground column .",
    "we have demonstrated that , for _ typical _ radio source luminosities , the 21  cm transition in seyfert obscuring disks is likely to be thermalized , and  absorption should be detected (  [ tspin ] ) . on the other hand",

    "since the hypothesis is that we see the bright radio nucleus directly , this case can be viewed as the opposite extreme of the free - free absorption scenario presented above .",
    "in particular , spin temperature effects may explain the lack of   absorption towards mrk  348 .",

    "we estimate that the spin temperature might be as high as @xmath125  k at a radius of 1  pc , and , as a result , 21  cm absorption opacity would be suppressed by a factor of @xmath126 !      originally proposed that the obscuring medium in seyfert galaxies might span scales much larger than the conventional torus model .",
    "more recently , reported that optical images of seyfert 2 galaxies are more likely to show @xmath36  pc dust absorption features than optical images of seyfert  1 galaxies .",
    "they argued that these galactic dust lanes are primarily responsible for hiding the central engine and blr in seyfert  2 nuclei .",
    "the characteristic scale of the obscuring medium in this galactic dust model is @xmath58  pc . to some degree galaxy disks must obscure seyfert nuclei , since seyfert nuclei are rarely found in edge - on disk galaxies (; ) .",
    "to explain the surprising lack of  absorption towards known , hidden seyfert 1 nuclei requires , ironically , obscuring disks on 10  pc scales or less . turning the arguments around , we would expect that kinematical line broadening , free - free absorption , and excitation effects would have little effect on 21  cm absorption from gas on 100  pc scales .",
    "therefore , the galactic dust model predicts pronounced  absorption towards radio - bright seyfert nuclei .",
    "we find instead that the dust lanes observed by are probably the source of the off - nuclear   absorption reported here .",
    "we conclude that the inner scale of the obscuring medium in hidden seyfert 1 galaxies must be less than a few tens of parsecs , in better agreement with the classical parsec - scale torus scenario .",

    "additional spectral information is needed to interpret the nuclear radio source and the non - detection of 21  cm absorption .",
    "otherwise , we have demonstrated that for plausible conditions in seyfert nuclei , either free - free absorption or excitation effects would suppress 21  cm absorption from parsec - scale obscuring disks .",

    "the radial scale of the central absorbing disks is hundreds of parsecs ( i.e. , less than a kiloparsec ) .",
    "high - velocity  absorption , doppler - shifted away from the systemic velocity of the host galaxy , can usually be explained by normal rotational motion rather than radial streaming ( e.g. , ngc  2110 ) .",

    "the corresponding mass inflow rates can be several  yr , generally exceeding the mass transfer rate required to fuel a seyfert nucleus .",

    "bright nuclear continuum sources , such as in mrk  348 , can enhance the spin temperature and suppress 21  cm line absorption .",
