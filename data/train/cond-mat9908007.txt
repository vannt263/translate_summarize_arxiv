    "when an incompressible binary fluid mixture is quenched far below its spinodal temperature , it will phase separate into domains of the two fluids . the simplest case ( in theory at least )",
    "is when the two fluids are thermodynamically and kinetically symmetrical : fluids a and b have identical properties in all respects except that they are mutually phobic . for a deep quench ( to a temperature well below the critical point ) the thermodynamic equilibrium state then has the two fluids completely demixed .",
    "one remaining control parameter is the volume fraction @xmath0 ; only for a 50:50 mix ( @xmath1 , which with thermodynamic symmetry is a quench through the critical point ) is the system totally symmetrical .",
    "other significant parameters are the surface tension @xmath2 , viscosity @xmath3 and the fluid mass density @xmath4 .",
    "there is also a mobility parameter @xmath5 which controls the collective diffusion of concentration fluctuations : this can remain important at late times , but only if @xmath0 is small enough ( less than about 0.150.20 for 3-d ) that the fluid domains depercolate .",
    "the minority droplets can then continue to coarsen by a ripening mechanism ( controlled by @xmath5 ) or by diffusion and coalescence of the droplets themselves ; both give a mean droplet size that scales with time as @xmath6 .",
    "if instead the domains remain connected , then the late - stage growth is driven by capillary forces ( laplace pressure ) , arising from curvature of the ( sharply defined ) interface between the two fluids ; these drive fluid flows from regions of tight curvature ( necks , narrow liquid bridges ) into those of low interfacial curvature ( large domains ) .",
    "note that for coarsening of a bicontinuous structure to proceed this way , one also requires discrete  pinch - off \" events to continually occur : each of these allows the topology to change discontinuously in time .",
    "for a theory - oriented review of the late stages of spinodal domain growth , see bray @xcite ; there are many relevant experimental studies as well @xcite .    in what follows ,",
    "we address two issues concerning domain growth in three dimensional binary fluid systems .",
    "( the two dimensional case has some special features of its own ; see @xcite . )",
    "the first issue concerns the role of inertia in the late stages ; this is a matter of continuing interest and controversy @xcite , that our recent simulation work @xcite illuminates .",
    "the second concerns the effect of an applied shear flow on the coarsening process .",
    "here we have only preliminary simulation results , but these are enough to suggest that there is more to this problem than a recent scaling theory @xcite suggests ; again , our discussion focuses on inertial effects .",
    "our simulation work uses two different mesoscale simulation methods .",
    "one is the lattice boltzmann ( lb ) method , in which a velocity distribution function @xmath7 and composition variable @xmath0 are defined at discrete lattice points .",
    "the rules for updating these quantities represent a discretization of the ( zero temperature ) navier - stokes equation for fluid flow , coupled to a cahn - hilliard type thermodynamic free energy functional @xmath8 $ ] , which provides the driving force for phase separation .",
    "the second method is dpd ( dissipative particle dynamics ) , which is a long - time - step , noisy molecular dynamics algorithm ( off lattice ) involving soft repulsive interaction potentials between two types of particle .",
    "( the repulsive interactions are chosen to favour demixing . )",
    "this is a fixed - temperature algorithm , in which stability is ensured , despite the long time - step , by introducing local damping and noise terms in accord with a suitable fluctuation dissipation theorem .",
    "crucially , both damping and noise act pairwise on particle velocities and hence conserve momentum locally , recovering the isothermal navier stokes equation at large length scales .",
    "for further information on lb for binary fluids see swift et al . @xcite and on dpd see groot and warren @xcite ; details of our algorithms and parameter settings are recorded elsewhere @xcite . note that in both methods we have run tests to check that , under the particular simulation conditions we adopt , fluids are behaving incompressibly .",
    "for simplicity , we restrict attention to fully symmetric mixtures ( @xmath1 ) for which the fluid domains comprise , in three dimensions , a fully bicontinuous structure .",
    "the late - time evolution of this structure remains incompletely understood despite theoretical @xcite , experimental @xcite and simulation @xcite work over recent years .      as emphasized by siggia @xcite ,",
    "the coarsening of a bicontinuous spinodal texture involves capillary forces ( governed by the interfacial tension , @xmath2 ) , viscous dissipation ( governed by the fluid viscosity @xmath3 ) , and fluid inertia ( governed by the mass density @xmath4 ) . out of these three physical parameters , ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 ) , only one length , @xmath9 and one time @xmath10 can be constructed , which allow us to describe the time evolution of the coarsening system in unique dimensionless length and time measures . for convenience",
    "we define the lengthscale @xmath11 of the domain structure at time @xmath12 via the structure factor @xmath13 as @xmath14 .",
    "provided no other physics except that described by the three macroscopic parameters , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , is involved in late stage growth this leads us to the dynamical scaling hypothesis @xcite : @xmath15 where we use reduced time and length variables , @xmath16 and @xmath17 . since dynamical scaling",
    "should hold only after interfaces have become sharp , and transport by molecular diffusion ignorable , we have allowed for a nonuniversal offset @xmath18 ; thereafter the scaling function @xmath19 should , in principle , approach a universal form , the same for all ( fully symmetric , deep - quenched , incompressible ) binary fluid mixtures .",
    "it was argued further by furukawa @xcite that , for small enough @xmath20 , fluid inertia is negligible compared to viscosity , whereas for large enough @xmath20 the reverse is true .",
    "dimensional analysis then requires the following asymptotes : @xmath21 where , if dynamical scaling holds , amplitudes @xmath22 and the crossover time @xmath23 ( defined , for example , by the intersection of asymptotes on a log - log plot ) are universal .",
    "several earlier numerical studies claim to see one or other of these scaling regimes , but of these , few provide accurate values of @xmath24 as required if the various datasets are to be compared on a scaling plot @xcite .",
    "those that do so , and which appear to confirm eq.[viscous ] , include the work of laradji et al .",
    "@xcite , for which @xmath25 , that of bastea and lebowitz @xcite ( @xmath26 ) and that of jury , bladon , krishna and cates @xcite ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "jury et al . performed a careful comparison of their own ( dpd ) and these others datasets ; while linear scaling was reported , they found no consistency in the value of @xmath28 .",
    "instead , a systematic trend appeared , in which @xmath28 drifts downward between datasets as one moves to larger @xmath20 and @xmath29 ( roughly , @xmath30 ) . despite this , within each dpd dataset , the linear @xmath20 dependence is clearly better than a fit to @xmath31 .",
    "jury et al . proposed that a non - scaling behaviour of this kind could perhaps be explained if some nonuniversal physics ( that is , not contained in @xmath32 ) were to intervene : they suggested a candidate involving the physics of topological reconnection , a process that , even at late times , could involve a molecular ( or discretization ) scale , small compared to @xmath33 .",
    "this possibility remains open , although our own , more recent , lb data @xcite suggests the following alternative explanation : ( a ) the linear law is indeed obeyed for @xmath34 ( with @xmath35 ) , but the @xmath28 coefficients of laradji et al . and of bastea and lebowitz are both overestimated due to residual diffusion effects ; ( b ) the data of jury et al .",
    "lies within a broad crossover region between eq.[viscous ] and eq.[inertial ] , where the local slope on a log - log plot is around @xmath36 ; ( c ) the preference for linear fits in these dpd datasets is partly caused by finite size corrections within each dataset .",
    "to better eliminate the latter , in our lb coarsening data we insist that @xmath37 , with @xmath38 the linear system size ( jury et al . allowed @xmath39 ) . a comparison between representative lb and dpd datasets , in a regime where both are available , is shown in fig .",
    "[ graph : compare ] . though not identical , it is hard to be sure that the remaining discrepancies do not arise from finite size corrections .",
    "[ graph : compare ]      the relative importance of inertial to viscous terms , in fluid mechanical problems , is traditionally measured by a reynolds number . in the spinodal context this is usually defined as re = re@xmath40 . in the linear regime",
    "it is of order @xmath41 .",
    "note that since @xmath28 is rather small , the maximum re achieved by jury et al ( for @xmath42 ) is only about 20 even with @xmath20 is of order @xmath43 . indeed , this is roughly where we now believe @xmath23 to lie ; a reynolds number of 20 is large enough for inertial effects to be non - negligible , but by fluid mechanics standards , still modest .",
    "note also that the scaling ideas clearly predict that re should increase without bound ( as @xmath6 ) within the inertial regime , eq.[inertial ] .",
    "however , in a recent paper @xcite grant and elder have argued that the reynolds number can not , in fact , continue to grow indefinitely .",
    "if so , eq.[inertial ] is not truly the large @xmath20 asymptote , which must instead have @xmath44 with @xmath45 .",
    "essentially , grant and elder argue that at large enough re , turbulent remixing of the interface will limit the coarsening rate @xcite , so that re stays bounded at a level which they estimate as re @xmath46 .",
    "our recent lb work @xcite represents the first large - scale simulations of 3-d spinodal decomposition to unambiguously attain a regime in which inertial forces dominate over viscous ones , allowing a test of this idea .",
    "we find direct evidence for furukawa s @xmath47 scaling , eq.[inertial ] .",
    "although a further crossover to a regime of saturating re can not be ruled out , we find no evidence for this up to re @xmath48 .",
    "two of our lb datasets are shown in fig.[graph : raw - data ] .",
    "the first has high @xmath49 ( high viscosity ) and corresponds to @xmath29 values around unity ( @xmath50 ) for the fitted part of the data .",
    "it is well fit by eq.[viscous ] .",
    "the second has low @xmath49 and corresponds to @xmath29 around @xmath51 ( or @xmath52 ) ; it is well fit by eq.[inertial ] .",
    "the reynolds number is about 0.1 near the end of the first run and about 350 near the end of the second .",
    "[ graph : raw - data ]    it goes without saying that no _ single _ simulation run could possibly cover this range of length or time scales , since that would require a lattice of around @xmath53 sites .",
    "our lattices are @xmath54 , but by changing the lb parameter values , we can access both regimes , and everything in between @xcite .",
    "similar exploration is possible ( to a lesser extent ) within dpd @xcite .",
    "such mesoscale methods have strong advantages over ( say ) md @xcite since , after proper calibration and subject to specified range limitations , they allow one to `` dial in '' ones own choice of thermodynamic ( @xmath2 ) and kinetic ( @xmath3 ) parameters",
    ". thus one can build up the @xmath19 curve section by section ; if it is universal , this is enough .",
    "( for a fuller explanation of the procedure , see kendon et al",
    ". @xcite . ) this is done for our lb data in fig.[graph : cooked ] ; note that the rightmost two datasets ( both in the inertial regime ) are almost contiguous , as one would hope on a universal scaling plot .",
    "( each has a slope close to @xmath55 . ) however , computational restraints prevent us so far from covering the entire @xmath19 curve with data ; it remains possible that some mismatches between runs , of the type reported by jury et al .",
    "@xcite might still be observed at intermediate @xmath56 .",
    "note the broad crossover between viscous ( three leftmost runs ) and inertial ( two rightmost runs ) regimes : this crossover covers four decades in @xmath20 ( or three in @xmath29 ) .",
    "but it is less spectacular when expressed in terms of re ; our data span @xmath57 re @xmath58 and the crossover region is roughly re @xmath59 .",
    "[ graph : cooked ]    it is important now to ask whether , at the largest re values we can reach , there is significant turbulence in the fluid flow .",
    "one quantitative signature of turbulence is the skewness @xmath60 of the longitudinal velocity derivatives ; this is close to zero in laminar flow but approaches @xmath61 in fully developed turbulence @xcite .",
    "a space - averaged value close to @xmath61 would imply turbulence everywhere and , presumably , significant remixing at the interface @xcite .",
    "we do detect increasingly negative @xmath60 as re is increased but reach only @xmath62 for re @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that at our highest re s , partially but not fully developed turbulence is present .",
    "this view is consistent with fig.[graph : velmaps ] , which shows velocity maps for low and high re runs , and ( for comparison ) single fluid freely decaying isotropic turbulence . in a low re flow one",
    "expects the only relevant lengthscale in the system to be the domain size @xmath33 ; at high re , there should be a cascade of structure in the velocity field below the domain size .",
    "some internal structure is plausibly , though not conclusively , visible in the plot for our lowest @xmath49 value .",
    "but since we do not yet see fully developed turbulence , it remains an open issue whether such effects would lead , beyond the observed @xmath64 inertial scaling regime , to a final , turbulent remixing regime ( of saturating re ) as proposed by grant and elder @xcite .",
    "if it does , the limiting value of re must significantly exceed their estimate of @xmath65 .    [",
    "graph : velmaps ]",
    "consider now the situation where a symmetric binary fluid undergoes a deep quench in conditions where a steady shear flow is applied externally . in simulations , there are two ways to achieve this .",
    "one is by lees - edwards ( moving periodic ) boundary conditions , which have been implemented in our dpd codes @xcite ; the other is to have sliding solid boundaries , and the lb results reported below use this method . for binary fluids under shear ,",
    "the two approaches give qualitatively similar results , for related work in two and three dimensions , see @xcite .",
    "the questions are as follows : does the presence of flow arrest the coarsening process , giving a steady state with a finite domain size , and , if so , what is the character of this steady state ?",
    "also , does this steady state depend on starting conditions  for example , if the binary fluids are allowed to demix first and the flow is then switched on , is the same final state achieved ? perhaps surprisingly ( despite the obvious importance of mixing and emulsification in many technological areas ) well - founded theoretical answers to these questions are almost nonexistent .",
    "an important theoretical inroad into this problem was made by doi and ohta @xcite .",
    "( its rheological consequences are reviewed in the book by larson @xcite , where comparisons to experiment can be found . )",
    "the doi - ohta work is entirely limited , however , to a regime of vanishingly small reynolds number .",
    "note that for this problem , the relevant re is the larger of re@xmath66 ( the value extracted from the coarsening process , which must vanish in any true steady state ) and @xmath67 which is the value found by considering the effect of the external shear rate @xmath68 on a droplet of scale @xmath33 .",
    "both definitions assume , perhaps implausibly , that there is only one relevant length , @xmath33 , which requires , for example , that domains are not strongly anisotropic ; we return to this point below .    doi and ohta assumed that , for nonzero @xmath68 , a steady state would be reached at negligible re ( so that inertial effects can be ignored ) .",
    "the applied flow stretches and deforms the interfaces ( tending also to orient these along the flow direction ) ; this is opposed by interfacial tension .",
    "the competition is measured by the capillary number ca @xmath69 ; at small ca , a spherical droplet of size @xmath33 is weakly perturbed , but at large ca it should be elongated to the point of rupture . by estimating the magnitude of each effect in the absence of the other , and balancing these , doi and ohta made the intriguing prediction that , in steady state , the fluid should have a @xmath68-independent viscosity of the form @xmath70 .",
    "that is , the behaviour should be independent of @xmath2 and @xmath4 , but dependent on @xmath0 ( values of @xmath0 close to 0.5 were assumed . )",
    "this form follows purely by dimensional analysis if one insists that the only relevant variables are @xmath71 and @xmath0 ( the absence of @xmath4 from this list is because inertia is neglected . )",
    "doi and ohta went on to develop specific approximation schemes that allowed them , for example , to study transient ( shear startup ) behaviour .    in the steady state ,",
    "the departure of @xmath72 from unity must come from the presence of interfacial stresses , which , if the structure is characterized by a single domain length @xmath33 , scale as @xmath73 . comparing this with the excess shear stress @xmath74",
    "we obtain a length estimate in steady state @xmath75 which corresponds to the system arranging itself , in steady state , so that the capillary number is of order unity .",
    "this argument is , of course , somewhat oversimplified .",
    "if more than one length scale is present ( for example , describing the structure along different directions relative to the flow ) then one has to determine which one dominates the interfacial contribution to the viscous stress .",
    "the largest laplace stresses arise in regions of strongest curvature ; however , if the strongest curvature is axial about the flow direction ( for example , thin cylinders lying along the flow ) it can not contribute to the shear stress at all @xcite . doi and ohta did not much explore these geometrical aspects of their work .",
    "note that , implicit in their whole description , is an assumption that a steady state can be achieved without inertial terms coming into play . our preliminary results on sheared spinodal systems , given below , cast some doubt on this assumption .",
    "we have simulated sheared binary fluids using both dpd and lb algorithms .",
    "the results presented here are for relatively small systems ( 50,000 dpd particles , and @xmath76 or @xmath77 lattices ) and thus are preliminary , but we think they point towards some interesting physics . in future work",
    "we hope to address larger systems ; among other things , this will allow reliable statistics for the interfacial stresses , and hence for the rheological properties of the sheared systems , to be obtained .",
    "our first result is that shear does inhibit coarsening .",
    "if one defines a single lengthscale via the total surface area @xmath78 in the system ( so that @xmath79 ) , then indeed this lengthscale increases more slowly , when shear is applied , than without it ( fig.[graph : onelength ] ) .",
    "[ graph : onelength ]    on the other hand , this one - lengthscale analysis fails to reflect the extreme anisotropy that can develop .",
    "indeed , by examining the eigenvalues @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , of the interfacial curvature matrix@xcite , @xmath83 lengths for the three different directions can be estimated , @xmath84 in these expressions , @xmath85 is the equilibrium width of the fluid - fluid interface , and @xmath86 is the local compositional order parameter defined on the lattice .",
    "the time evolutions of these three lengths are plotted for a system with @xmath87 in fig.[graph : threelengths ] .",
    "[ graph : threelengths ]    this data shows strong anisotropy developing , with elongation of domains along the flow direction . under these conditions ,",
    "finite size effects become greatly emphasized @xcite : domains , elongated along the flow , soon reach the size of the simulation box and connect up to their periodic images . a sheared lb configuration , during the initial phase before this happens ( such that @xmath88 are all small compared to the simulation size @xmath38 ) is shown in fig.[graph : tubes](a ) .",
    "however , this configuration is not close to a steady state .",
    "the structure we observe on approach to the steady state is , in all cases we have so far studied , clearly finite - size influenced . for @xmath0 different from 0.5 , the appearance is like that of a  string phase \" @xcite in colloids : effectively infinite tubes of the minority fluid oriented along the streamlines . a typical example of this , found using dpd , is shown in fig.[graph : tubes](b ) .",
    "although no longer bicontinuous in the transverse direction , this structure can continue to coarsen , very slowly , by diffusive transport ( ripening ) : it seems likely that , for this system size , the final state will be a single cylinder of fluid .",
    "figure [ graph : tubes](c ) shows a lb simulation for @xmath89 viewed along the streamlines ; this has coarsened to the point where finite size effects are obvious even transverse to the flow direction .",
    "the structure is strongly oriented , with continuous domains of the two fluids passing right through the sample from front to back ; however , it remains connected transverse to the flow with thin necklike bridges clearly visible .",
    "in fact , for @xmath89 , such transverse connectivity is inevitable unless the symmetry between the two fluids is spontaneously broken .",
    "thus the structure remains capable of coarsening further , by a non - diffusive hydrodynamic mechanism .",
    "for this system size , the final state could be total separation , just as it would be without shear flow : such a state might be stable so long as the final interface between the two fluids is parallel to the streamlines .    ' '' ''    [ graph : tubes ]      in our simulations on these ( fairly small ) systems , we see no evidence of a steady state structure emerging that is independent of system size .",
    "this is intriguing .",
    "if the doi - ohta scaling is correct , we should obtain a length scale given by eq.[length ] ; so long as this is small compared to @xmath38 ( and the steady state structure is not too anisotropic ) the simulation should achieve a proper steady state , representative of that of an infinite sample . put differently , this will arise if the maximum capillary number attainable in a system of size @xmath38 , ca @xmath90 , is much larger than one .",
    "this is true for our largest dpd runs , with @xmath91 , yet we see no sign of any steady state not dominated by finite size effects ; larger runs would be useful to clarify this issue .",
    "an important possibility , which these results suggest , is as follows . by neglecting inertia and yet assuming a steady state , doi and ohta",
    "implicitly assume that this steady - state can be characterized by a notional capillary number ca @xmath92 ( based on a single measure of domain size @xmath33 ) of order one .",
    "this might be incorrect : without inertia , there may simply be no obstacle to complete separation of the two fluids in simple shear .",
    "indeed , one can instead postulate a fully phase separated state with two blocks of fluid , separated by an interface in the plane of shear ( or , in fact , any other orientation with the surface normals everywhere perpendicular to the fluid velocity ) .",
    "for such a flow , the _",
    "notional _ capillary number is infinite ( since @xmath33 is infinite ) , but the _ effective _ value is zero : the interface is oriented parallel to the streamlines and there is no stretching of it by the flow .",
    "this structure is likely to be destabilized by inertial contributions , since it involves steady shear of a laminar interface between two fluids ( although this may require a threshold of shear rate , such as @xmath93 , to be exceeded ) .",
    "thus it remains possible that a steady state , with a non - infinite domain scale can arise _ only _ when inertial terms are significant .",
    "if so the reynolds number is just as important as the capillary number , and the implicit criterion ca @xmath94 of the doi - ohta theory is not adequate . to test this point , one needs to run simulations under shear at high re .",
    "we intend to pursue this , using our parallel lb code @xcite , in the near future .",
    "meanwhile it is straightforward to check that , at the system sizes and shear rates used here , a starting configuration with oriented slabs of fluid ( with an interface parallel to the shear planes ) remains essentially unperturbed by the flow .",
    "however , if the initial interface normal is not perpendicular to the streamlines , the slabs are immediately broken up , and the late stage coarsening ( with a slowly - evolving , tubular structure along the streamlines ) resembles that which we found above for the case of an initially homogenous phase , quenched to form demixing domains , in the presence of steady shear .",
    "we have described two problems , in the physics of immiscible binary fluids , where inertial effects are important .",
    "one is the late stages of demixing ( in the absence of applied flow ) where the internal dynamics of the system drives it to high reynolds numbers .",
    "whether the final re is self - limiting , as recently suggested by grant and elder @xcite remains to be seen ; however , we have observed @xcite clear evidence of an inertial - dominated regime in which the furukawa ( @xmath47 ) scaling is found .",
    "the second problem is in the steady state behaviour of binary fluids in simple shear .",
    "our preliminary simulation results , though far from conclusive , inspired us to speculata that the very existence of such a steady state is itself dependent on inertial effects .",
    "if so , the scaling analysis that underlies doi - ohta theory @xcite , is in doubt .",
    "future simulations on much larger systems should allow us to settle this point .",
