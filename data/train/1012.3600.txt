    "this has several causes : ( 1 ) a thorough understanding of the physics of a high - density electron - hole gas in zno is lacking . ( 2 ) around the exciton resonance at 3.31 ev , no pump - probe reflectivity measurements have yet been reported .",

    "screening gradually destroys the exciton resonance .",
    "next to the vanishing of the exciton resonance due to screening , band - gap renormalization determines the optical properties : the band gap shrinks for increasing carrier density due to exchange and correlation effects . a final important effect for the optical spectra is band filling .",
    "we first quantitatively address these three phenomena and subsequently compute the density - dependent absorption and reflectivity spectra .",
    "zno has one conduction band and three valence bands , called a , b , and c. each of these four bands is twofold degenerate because of the spin degree of freedom .",
    "the valence bands are split by the crystal field and the spin - orbit coupling : the ab splitting equals 10 mev , the ac splitting 44 mev.@xcite at present it is unclear how the band - gap renormalization behaves in case of multiple split valence bands .",

    "after about 2 ps all surface carriers have been trapped and the remaining bulk carriers produce the reflectivity plateau .",

    "<S> at carrier densities above the mott density coulomb screening destroys the exciton resonance . </S>",
    "<S> this , together with band - gap renormalization and band filling , severely affects the optical spectra . </S>",
    "<S> we have experimentally studied these effects by ultrafast pump - probe reflectivity measurements on a zno single crystal at various wavelengths around the exciton resonance and in a broad carrier - density range . </S>",
    "<S> theoretically we determined the mott density in zno to be @xmath0 m@xmath1 at 300 k. taking a field - theoretical approach , we derived and solved the bethe - salpeter ladder equation and we computed the density - dependent reflectivity and absorption spectra . a carrier dynamics model has been developed , containing three - photon absorption , carrier cooling , and carrier trapping near the surface . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement between the theoretical reflectivity based on our model and the experimental data is excellent . </S>"
