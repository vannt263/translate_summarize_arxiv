    "higgs bundles over a compact riemann surface @xmath1 were introduced by nigel hitchin in @xcite as a pair @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a rank @xmath0 and degree @xmath7 holomorphic vector bundle on @xmath1 , with fixed determinant , and @xmath8 a section of @xmath9 with trace zero .",
    "@xmath10 denotes the canonical line bundle of @xmath1  the cotangent bundle of @xmath1 . nowadays those are also known as @xmath11-higgs bundles . in the same paper , hitchin determined the poincar polynomial of the corresponding moduli space @xmath12 , for @xmath7 odd .",
    "the method was based on morse - bott theory , so smoothness of the moduli was an essential feature .",
    "it was then clear that @xmath12 has an extremely rich topological structure , so a natural question was to ask about the topology of the moduli spaces of higgs bundles for other groups . for @xmath13 ,",
    "this was achieved by p. gothen in @xcite and more recently , and using a new approach , o. garca - prada , j. heinloth and a. schmitt in @xcite obtained the same for @xmath14 and recursive formulas for @xmath15 .",
    "other recent developments were achieved in @xcite on the study of @xmath16 , which seem to confirm some fascinating conjectures @xcite .",
    "all these cases were done under the condition of coprimality between rank and degree , so that the moduli spaces are smooth .    however , for a general real , connected , semisimple lie group @xmath17 , the moduli spaces @xmath18 of @xmath17-higgs bundles with fixed topological type @xmath19 , are non - smooth .",
    "this is one of the reasons why the topology of @xmath18 is basically unknown .",
    "still , their most basic topological invariant  the number of connected components  is a honourable exception in this unknown territory , and much is known about it . if @xmath17 is compact then @xmath18 is non - empty and connected for any @xmath19 @xcite and the same is true if @xmath17 is complex @xcite . in both cases the same holds",
    "even if @xmath17 is just reductive or even non - connected ( the only difference is that for non - connected groups , the topological type is indexed not by @xmath20 , but by a different set @xcite ) .",
    "when @xmath17 is a real group , the situation can be drastically different .",
    "there are two cases where extra components are known to occur : when @xmath17 is a split real form of @xmath21 and when @xmath17 is a non - compact group of hermitian type .",
    "suppose @xmath17 is a split real form of @xmath21 .",
    "intuitively this means that @xmath17 is the `` maximally non - compact '' real form of @xmath21 ; see for example @xcite for the precise definition .",
    "for instance @xmath22 and @xmath23 are split real forms of @xmath15 and of @xmath24 , respectively . for these groups , hitchin proved in @xcite that there always exists at least one topological type @xmath25 for which @xmath18 is disconnected and that the `` extra '' component is contractible and indeed isomorphic to a vector space  this is the celebrated _ hitchin component _ also known as _",
    "teichmller component_. we will not pursue in this direction here .    a non - compact semisimple lie group @xmath17 of _ hermitian type _ is characterised by the fact that @xmath26 is a hermitian symmetric space , where @xmath27 is a maximal compact subgroup .",
    "thus @xmath26 admits a complex structure compatible with the riemannian structure , making it a khler manifold .",
    "if @xmath26 is irreducible , the centre of the lie algebra of @xmath28 is one - dimensional and this implies that the torsion - free part of @xmath29 is isomorphic to @xmath30 , hence the topological type gives rise to an integer @xmath7 ( usually the degree of some vector bundle ) , called the _",
    "toledo invariant_. this toledo invariant is subject to a bound condition , called the _ milnor - wood inequality _ , beyond which the moduli spaces @xmath31 are empty . moreover ,",
    "when @xmath32 is maximal ( and @xmath17 is of tube type @xcite ) there is a so - called _ cayler partner phenomena _ which implies the existence of extra components for @xmath31 .",
    "this has been studied for many classes of hermitian type groups @xcite and proved in an intrinsic and general way recently in @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the connected components of @xmath31 for non - maximal and non - zero toledo invariant are not known in general .",
    "one exception is the case of @xmath33 , which has been basically dealt in @xcite .",
    "two other exceptions are the cases of @xmath34 and of @xmath35  the identity component of @xmath36 . in these two cases ,",
    "it is known @xcite that all the non - maximal subspaces are connected for each fixed topological type . note that in the case of @xmath37 , the topological type is given by an element @xmath38 , with @xmath7 being the toledo invariant ; so for each @xmath7 there are two components , labeled by @xmath39 .",
    "we expect that the same holds true in general , that is , @xmath31 is connected for non - maximal @xmath7 and fixed topological type .    in this paper",
    "we give an overview of the proof given in @xcite of the connectedness of @xmath40 and @xmath41 for non - maximal and non - zero @xmath7 . in this study one",
    "is naturally lead to consider a certain type of pairs , which we call _ quadric bundles _ , and the corresponding moduli spaces , depending on a real parameter @xmath42 .",
    "denote them by @xmath43 .",
    "the relevant parameter for the study of @xmath40 and @xmath41 is @xmath44 .",
    "the idea is to obtain a description of the connected components of @xmath45 , for a specific value @xmath46 of the parameter @xmath42 , and then vary @xmath42 , analysing the wall - crossing in the spirit of @xcite .",
    "it turns out that a crucial step in that proof ( namely in the description of of @xmath45 ) is a detailed analysis of the hitchin fibration for @xmath47-twisted @xmath11-higgs bundles , taking into account _ all _ the fibres of the hitchin map and not only the generic ones .",
    "this was done in @xcite , and we briefly describe this analysis .    in the last section of the paper we briefly mention some other results concerning the spaces @xmath43 , obtained in @xcite , that lead to the description of some geometric and topological properties of these moduli spaces . in particular , these results imply that , under some conditions on @xmath7 and on the genus of @xmath1 , a torelli type theorem holds for @xmath43 .",
    "let @xmath1 be a compact riemann surface of genus @xmath48 , with canonical line bundle @xmath49 , the holomorphic cotangent bundle .",
    "let @xmath17 be a real semisimple , connected , lie group .",
    "fix a maximal compact subgroup @xmath50 with complexification @xmath51 . if @xmath52 are the corresponding lie algebras , then the cartan decomposition is @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the vector space defined as the orthogonal complement of @xmath55 with respect to the killing form . since @xmath56\\subset{\\mathfrak{m}^{\\mathbb{c}}}$ ] , then @xmath54 is a representation of @xmath57 via the _ isotropy representation _",
    "@xmath58 induced by the adjoint representation @xmath59 .",

    "[ definition of higgs bundle ] a _ @xmath17-higgs bundle _ over @xmath1 is a pair @xmath63 where @xmath60 is a principal holomorphic @xmath57-bundle and @xmath8 is a global holomorphic section of @xmath64 , called the _",
    "higgs field_.    in practice we usually replace the principal @xmath57-bundle @xmath60 by the corresponding vector bundle associated to some standard representation of @xmath57 in some @xmath65 .",
    "let us give two examples .",
    "if @xmath66 , then @xmath67 gives rise to a rank @xmath68 vector bundle @xmath6 with trivial determinant and since @xmath69 , the higgs field @xmath8 is a traceless @xmath10-twisted endomorphism of @xmath6 .",
    "if we fix the determinant of @xmath6 to be any line bundle and impose the same traceless condition to @xmath70 , then we also call the pair @xmath5 an @xmath15-higgs bundle , although it is really a `` twisted '' @xmath15-higgs bundle .",
    "all these are usually just called _ higgs bundles with fixed determinant_. these are the `` original '' higgs bundles , introduced in @xcite .",
    "if @xmath71 , we can take @xmath72 as a maximal compact subgroup .",
    "so @xmath73 gives rise to a rank @xmath68 holomorphic vector bundle @xmath6 .",
    "the cartan decomposition is @xmath74 where the inclusion @xmath75 is given by @xmath76 .",
    "so @xmath77 .",
    "hence we have that :    an @xmath23-higgs bundle is a triple @xmath78 where @xmath6 is a holomorphic rank @xmath68 vector bundle , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .    in an @xmath23-higgs bundle @xmath78",

    "a general notion of ( semi , poly)stability of @xmath17-higgs bundles was developed , allowing for proving a hitchin ",

    "it should be noted that the stability conditions depend on a parameter @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the centre of @xmath55 . in most cases",
    "this parameter is fixed by the topological type , so it really does not play any relevant role .",
    "this happens for any compact or complex lie group and most real groups .",

    "so :    the moduli space @xmath212 is isomorphic to the moduli space of rank @xmath0 orthogonal vector bundles ( without fixed topological type ) .",

    "this is done using the theory of spectral covers and their jacobians and prym varieties , as developed in @xcite .",
    "besides these classical references , the reader may also check the details of the following definitions for instance in @xcite .    for every @xmath270",
    ", there is a naturally associated curve @xmath271  the _ spectral curve _ of @xmath260  inside the total space of @xmath272 .",
    "the projection @xmath273 is a @xmath274 cover of @xmath1 , with the branch locus being given by the divisor of @xmath260 .    for generic @xmath263",

    "it is well - known that @xmath259 is indeed ( a torsor for ) the _ prym variety _ of @xmath271 .",
    "this prym variety is , in particular , a complex torus , so connected . if @xmath275 then the connectedness of every fibre of @xmath276 follows from the connectedness of the generic fibre ( see proposition 3.7 of @xcite ) .",
    "it is nevertheless important to notice that @xmath277 , so @xmath278 can be any positive integer .",
    "moreover , it is precisely the case @xmath279 that is of most interest to us , since that is the case relevant to @xmath2-higgs bundles .",
    "so , for these cases , our knowledge of the generic fibre is not enough to draw conclusions on the connectedness of the singular fibres , that is , the ones where the spectral curve @xmath271 acquires singularities .",
    "however , this was achieved by p. gothen and the author in @xcite as follows .",
    "when the spectral case is irreducible , we use the correspondence between higgs pairs on @xmath1 and rank one torsion free sheaves on @xmath271 @xcite to show that the fibre of the hitchin map is essentially the compactification by rank @xmath280 torsion free sheaves of the prym of the double cover @xmath281 . in order to prove the connectedness of the fibre , we made use of the the compactification of the jacobian of @xmath271 by the _",
    "parabolic modules _ of cook @xcite .",
    "one advantage of this compactification is that it fibres over the jacobian of the normalisation of @xmath271 , as opposed to the compactification by rank one torsion free sheaves . in the case of reducible spectral curve @xmath271",
    ", we gave a direct description of the fibre as a stratified space .",
    "all together , the statement of our result , adapted to the situation under consideration in proposition [ fibres quad and higgs isomorphic ] , is the following .",
    "consider the hitchin map @xmath282 .",
    "for any @xmath260 , @xmath259 is connected .",
    "moreover , for @xmath270 , the dimension of the fibre is @xmath283 .",
    "as @xmath223 is connected and of dimension @xmath284 , this settles theorem [ thm : nalpham ] .",
    "the following corollary of theorem [ thm : nalpham ] is immediate .",
    "[ cor : connectednessn-;g-1<d<2g-2 ] if @xmath285 , then the moduli space @xmath163 is connected .    for the cases @xmath286",
    ", we must take into account other values of the parameter and not just @xmath46 .",
    "having established the connectedness of the space @xmath45 in theorem [ thm : nalpham ] , the purpose of this section is to study the variation of the moduli spaces @xmath287 with the stability parameter @xmath42 .",
    "recall that the goal is to be able to say something about the connectedness of @xmath163 . as in several other cases",
    "@xcite , we have _ critical values _ for the parameter .",
    "these are special values @xmath288 , for which the @xmath42-semistability condition changes .",

    "if @xmath292 denotes the value of any parameter between the critical values @xmath288 and @xmath293 , we can write without ambiguity @xmath294 for the moduli space of @xmath292-semistable quadric bundles of for any @xmath42 between @xmath288 and @xmath293 .",
    "likewise , define @xmath295 , with @xmath296 denoting any value between the critical values @xmath297 and @xmath288 .",
    "with this notation we have @xmath298 .",
    "the information obtained so far on the variation of @xmath287 with @xmath42 and @xmath7 is summarised in the next graphic .",
    "l        above the line @xmath210 , @xmath43 is empty as well as on the right of the line @xmath112 . for a fixed @xmath219 , the region on the left of the line @xmath299 , is the region @xmath45 described in the previous section , where there are no critical values .",
    "the critical values are represented by the dots between the lines @xmath300 and @xmath112 .    &    given a critical value @xmath288 we have the corresponding subvariety @xmath301 consisting of those pairs which are @xmath292-semistable but @xmath296-unstable . in the same manner , define the subvariety @xmath302 .",
    "consequently , @xmath303 so the spaces @xmath304 encode the difference between the spaces @xmath295 and @xmath294 on opposite sides of the critical value @xmath288 .",
    "this difference is usually known as the _ wall - crossing _ phenomena through @xmath288 . in order to study this wall - crossing",
    "we need a description of the spaces @xmath304 .",
    "in section 3 of @xcite we studied these @xmath304 for any critical value .",
    "in particular , it was enough to conclude that they have high codimension in @xmath305 . for technical reasons",
    ", we had to impose the condition @xmath306 .",
    "more precisely , we have the following .    [ prop : codims+- ] suppose that @xmath306 .",
    "then @xmath307 , for any @xmath156",
    ". moreover , for any @xmath308 , the codimensions of @xmath309 are strictly positive .      since we already know from theorem [ thm : nalpham ] that @xmath45 is connected for any @xmath219 , proposition [ prop : codims+- ] yields the following ( cf .",
    "* theorem 5.3 ) ) :    the moduli spaces @xmath43 are connected for any @xmath306 and any @xmath310 .    [",
    "cor : connectednessn-;0<d < g-1 ] if @xmath286 , then the moduli space @xmath163 is connected .",
    "recall that we want to study the connected components of the moduli space @xmath163 of @xmath113-polystable quadric bundles , for any @xmath130 . from corollaries [ cor :",
    "connectednessn-;g-1<d<2g-2 ] and [ cor : connectednessn-;0<d < g-1 ] we see that the only remaining case to understand is when @xmath311 .",
    "notice that the space @xmath312 is really @xmath313 .",
    "now , although the codimensions of every @xmath304 are only known under the condition @xmath306 , it follows from corollaries 3.11 and 3.15 of @xcite that the codimensions of both @xmath314 are known to be positive also when @xmath311 . from this , arguing as in the last paragraph of the proof of ( * ? ? ? * theorem 5.3 ) , we prove that also @xmath312 is connected .",
    "so we conclude that :    [ prop : n0connected ] the moduli space of @xmath113-polystable quadric bundles of degree @xmath7 is connected for every @xmath130 .",
    "proposition [ prop : boundcomp ] and theorem [ prop : n0connected ] imply then that we have achieved our objective of calculating the number of connected components of the moduli space of @xmath2-higgs bundles over @xmath1 , with non - maximal and non - zero toledo invariant :      this theorem has in fact been proved before @xcite , by o. garca - prada and i. mundet i riera in @xcite , using different techniques .",
    "more precisely , they do consider quadric bundles , but prove the connectedness directly , i.e. , fixing @xmath44 and not implementing the variation of the parameter .",
    "our method easily generalises for @xmath149-quadric bundles  see remark [ rmk : u - quad ]  for any line bundle @xmath149 .",
    "in particular , if we consider @xmath315-quadric bundles , with @xmath47 some line bundle of degree @xmath280 , then these are related with @xmath37-higgs bundles with non - maximal ( and non - zero ) toledo invariant , in the same way @xmath10-quadric bundles arise in the @xmath2 case . applying definition [ definition of higgs bundle ] , it is easy to check that an @xmath37-higgs bundle is defined by a tuple @xmath316 where @xmath47 is a line bundle , @xmath317 is an orthogonal rank @xmath152 bundle and the higgs field is defined by maps @xmath318 and @xmath319 .",
    "these are topologically classified by the degree @xmath7 of @xmath47 ( this is the toledo invariant ) and by the second stiefel - whitney class @xmath320 of @xmath321 .",
    "note that @xmath37 is isomorphic to @xmath322 .",
    "moreover , an @xmath37-higgs bundle lifts to an @xmath2-higgs bundle if and only if @xmath323 .        recalling that non - abelian hodge theory implies that the moduli space of @xmath17-higgs bundles over @xmath1 is homeomorphic to the space of conjugacy classes of reductive representations of @xmath3 in @xmath17 ( cf .",
    "remark [ rmk : nonabelianhodge ] ) , we conclude the both theorems [ thm : connnectedsp4 ] and [ thm : connnectedso(2,3 ) ] have their counterparts on the representations side ( see @xcite for the detailed statements ) .        our method to analyse the components of the moduli spaces @xmath43 of @xmath42-semistable quadric bundles of degree @xmath7 was to start with the study in the lowest extreme of @xmath42 , that is the study of @xmath45 .",
    "one can ask what happens in the highest possible extreme , namely @xmath326 . since this is a critical value , take a slight lower value , @xmath327 , for a small @xmath328 . here , different phenomena arise .",
    "briefly , it is easy to check that if @xmath144 is @xmath329-semistable , then @xmath6 is itself semistable as a rank @xmath0 vector bundle . if @xmath330 denotes the moduli space of polystable rank @xmath0 degree @xmath7 vector bundles on @xmath1 , this yields a forgetful map @xmath331 . if @xmath210 , this map is an embedding because @xmath332 is , as we saw , the moduli of orthogonal vector bundles and thus follows from @xcite . if @xmath333 , the determination of the image of @xmath334 is a brill - noether problem . if @xmath306 , @xmath334 is surjective and if , further , @xmath335 , the map @xmath334 , suitably restricted , is a projective bundle over the stable locus @xmath336 .",
    "this is explained in proposition 3.13 of @xcite .",
    "so assume @xmath335 , and from now on let us just consider quadric bundles @xmath144 where the determinant of @xmath6 is fixed to be some line bundle @xmath337 of degree @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath338 and @xmath339 denote the corresponding obvious moduli spaces . using the projective bundle @xmath334 onto the stable locus of @xmath340 and through a detailed analysis of the the smooth locus @xmath341",
    ", we were able to obtain some geometric and topological results on @xmath43 .",
    "this procedure is taken in detail in @xcite again in the more general setting of @xmath149-quadric bundles .",
    "for instance we proved that @xmath342 is irreducible and @xmath343 is simply - connected  see corollaries 4.3 and 4.4 of @xcite .",
    "the irreducibility was already known from @xcite , using different methods .    under some slight conditions on the genus of @xmath1",
    ", we calculated the torsion - free part of the first three integral cohomology groups of the smooth locus @xmath341 for any @xmath42 .",
    "in particular ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 5.6 ) says that @xmath344 is isomorphic to @xmath345 .",
    "this fact , together with the assumption that the genus of @xmath1 is at least @xmath346 , and after properly defining a polarisation on @xmath344 compatible with the one on @xmath345 , allowed us to prove that a torelli type theorem holds for @xmath342 . from this",
    "it follows that the same is also true for the non - fixed determinant moduli .",
    "to emphasise now the base curve , write @xmath347 for the moduli space of @xmath42-polystable quadric bundles of rank two with fixed determinant @xmath337 on @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath348 be the same thing but just fixing the degree and not the determinant .",
    "let @xmath1 and @xmath349 be smooth projective curves of genus @xmath350 , @xmath337 and @xmath351 line bundles of degree @xmath335 and @xmath352 on @xmath1 and @xmath349 , respectively . if @xmath353 then @xmath354 .",
    "the same holds for @xmath348 and @xmath355 .",
    "one natural question is to wonder if the procedure we described here can be generalised to ranks higher than @xmath0 .",
    "first , proposition [ prop : boundcomp ] is true for any rank ( it is even true for any real reductive lie group ) .",
    "proposition [ prop : localmin ] also generalises in a straightforward way for @xmath23 for @xmath356 , so we are again lead to the study of higher rank quadric bundles .",
    "the technical problems start here because the @xmath42-semistability condition can be much more complicated in higher rank , involving not only subbundles but filtrations ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "one consequence is that the study of @xmath45 and mainly of @xmath304 should become much more complicated .",
