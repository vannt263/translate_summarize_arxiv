    "since the first observation of non  fermi liquid ( nfl ) behavior in 1991 @xcite , many intermetallic compounds have been found with low temperature thermodynamic properties that can not be described within landau s fermi liquid theory ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "typically , such alloys show a logarithmic or a weak power law dependence in c / t and in the magnetic susceptibility @xmath2 at low temperatures , as well as a non ",
    "t@xmath3 dependence of the electrical resistivity @xmath4 ( for example @xmath5 t ) .",
    "all of these compounds are close to magnetism . in searching for further examples for nfl  behavior , andraka and",
    "stewart @xcite characterized ucu@xmath0pd as a non - fermi liquid .",
    "they found a power  law temperature dependence of the sommerfeld coefficient @xmath6 ( @xmath7 = 450 @xmath8 , @xmath9 = 0.32 ) over a decade in temperature between 1 and 10 k : the magnetic susceptibility @xmath2 also followed a power law with the same @xmath9 between 1.8 k and 10 k. furthermore , the electrical resistivity increased linearly below 10 k with a slope six times larger than in u@xmath10y@xmath11pd@xmath12 @xcite . a possible explanation for this nfl  behavior is , according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the proximity to antiferromagnetism suppressed to t@xmath13 = 0 in this compound .",
    "this is called the  quantum critical point ",
    "( qcp ) scenario .    following this seminal work ,",
    "much research has been done on ucu@xmath0pd and its physical properties have been explained by various other theories .",
    "castro neto et al .",
    "@xcite suggested that a _",
    "griffiths phase _ causes the nfl  behavior , whereupon de andrade et al .",
    "@xcite fit their ucu@xmath0pd  data down to 0.6  k to this theory .",
    "scheidt et al .",
    "@xcite , however , showed that their c / t data down to 60 mk matches this model only in a small temperature range around 1  k. this was also confirmed by vollmer et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "bernal et al .",
    "@xcite interpreted the nfl  behavior of ucu@xmath0pd within the framework of the _ kondo disorder model_. this model presupposes a distribution of microscopic exchange couplings and was argued to successfully explain the observed nfl  behavior in the magnetic susceptibility and the specific heat .",
    "ucu@xmath0pd is particularly well  suited for studying the influence of disorder because of the possibility of perfect chemical ordering in this compound which crystallizes in the cubic aube@xmath14 structure . in this ideal case",
    "the pd atoms would occupy the 4c sites and the cu atoms would occupy the smaller 16e sites .",
    "xafs experiments @xcite , however , indicate that in an unannealed sample of ucu@xmath0pd only 76 % of the pd atoms populate the 4c sites , the remaining 24 % are on the 16e sites .",
    "another hint for disorder in this compound is , according to ref .",
    "@xcite , that the change of the slope of the lattice parameter of ucu@xmath15pd@xmath16 versus the pd concentration x occurs at x @xmath17 0.85 and not as would be expected at x = 1 for an ideal , ordered compound .    in this work",
    "we study annealed ucu@xmath0pd  samples , where the pd atoms are rearranged from the 16e sites to the 4c sites .",
    "this allows us to study ucu@xmath0pd with less ( but not zero ) intrinsic disorder in order to analyze the importance of disorder for its nfl  behavior . the original discovery work @xcite reported the effect of annealing on ucu@xmath18pd@xmath19 , but not on ucu@xmath20pd .",
    "the only other annealing study of which we are aware reported that @xcite , within their error bar , no difference in disorder in ball milled ( which introduces strain that broadens diffraction peak line widths ) unannealed and annealed ( at 925 @xmath21c for one week ) samples of ucu@xmath20pd could be found in elastic neutron diffraction measurements .",
    "we show by x - ray , ac - susceptibility , resistivity and specific heat data that the physical properties of ucu@xmath0pd are extremely sensitive to annealing .",
    "we conclude that disorder may not be the underlying mechanism for the nfl  behavior in the specific heat and resistivity .",
    "the samples of ucu@xmath0pd presented in this work were all obtained from the same batch .",
    "this batch was arc ",
    "melted under a highly purified argon atmosphere . to obtain the highest possible homogeneity ,",
    "the sample was flipped over four times and remelted .",
    "the loss in weight was 0.2 % .",
    "the sample was then cut in several pieces .",
    "these pieces were treated in different ways : one was measured as cast , one was annealed in an evacuated quartz glass tube for seven days at 750 @xmath21c , one for 14 days at 750 @xmath21c and another one was splat cooled ( cooling rate more than 10@xmath22 k / s ) as a way to introduce more disorder than the as cast sample .",
    "all these samples were identified as single - phase ( aube@xmath14 structure ) in extra long counting time powder diffraction measurements . also in specific heat and ac ",
    "susceptibility measurements no impurity phases like ucu@xmath14 or upd@xmath12 were detected within @xmath23  accuracy .",
    "the annealed samples showed no weight loss within @xmath24  accuracy .",
    "in the inset of figure [ 1 ] ) the lattice parameter * a * of unannealed ucu@xmath15pd@xmath16 is plotted versus the pd concentration x. the concentration dependence of the lattice parameter * a * can be described by two straight lines with an intersection at x @xmath17 0.85 .",
    "this points to the beginning of augmented ( i.e. above random disorder present for x @xmath25 0.85 ) occupation of the smaller 16e sites by the pd atoms at this x = 0.85 concentration @xcite .",
    "the expanded plot around x = 1 ( figure [ 1]a ) shows in addition the lattice parameters of the two annealed and the one splat cooled samples .",
    "one observes that the lattice parameters of the annealed samples nearly lie on the straight line which fits the data points from unannealed samples with pd concentrations lower than x = 0.8 .",
    "the decrease of the lattice parameter with annealing can be attributed to a thermally activated movement of the pd atoms from the smaller 16e sites to the bigger 4c sites .",
    "the lattice parameter of the splat cooled sample , however , is clearly much larger than the unannealed one , which is indicative of increased disorder .",
    "the lattice parameter of the splat cooled ucu@xmath20pd sample is almost the same as that of unannealed ucu@xmath26pd@xmath27 .",
    "a further test for increasing order upon annealing is the full width at half maximum of an x  ray peak . as an example , figure [ 1]b ) shows the [ 3 1 1 ] peak from x  ray powder diffraction measurements of the splat cooled , the unannealed , the 7 and the 14 days annealed ucu@xmath0pd samples .",
    "the full width at half maximum clearly gets smaller in this sequence , which is a strong indication of increasing order with annealing the samples .",
    "the resistivity ratio of the 7 days and 14 days annealed samples between t=1.8  k and t=400  k decreases by @xmath28 ( see figure  3 ) , which also supports increasing order for extended annealing .    with these samples with different degrees of disorder , we are now able to make a systematic study of the role that disorder plays for the physical behavior of ucu@xmath0pd .    in figure [ 2]a ) @xmath7c / t is displayed versus log  t for all these samples except the splat cooled one .",
    "it can be seen that the antiferromagnetic transition @xcite of the unannealed ucu@xmath0pd sample ( t@xmath29 170 mk ) is suppressed by annealing .",
    "the 7 days annealed sample of ucu@xmath0pd still shows an inkling of such a transition ( @xmath17 140 mk ) , whereas ucu@xmath0pd  14 days annealed  follows a logarithmic dependence down to the lowest measured temperature of 0.08 k. this logarithmic temperature dependence expands upon annealing to cover more than two decades as can be seen in the inset of figure [ 2]a ) .    to compare our specific heat data to the griffiths phase model @xcite that predicts a power  law behavior @xmath30 with @xmath31",
    ", we have performed a careful @xmath32analysis of our data : i ) a two  parameter logarithmic fit @xmath33 leads to @xmath34 and @xmath35 for fits in the temperature regions @xmath36 and @xmath37 , resp .",
    "ii ) a three  parameter power ",
    "law fit @xmath38 converges to the _ same _ @xmath32values with the fit parameter @xmath39 and @xmath40 , @xmath41 large and with opposite signs @xcite .",
    "one easily sees that this is effectively equivalent to our two ",
    "parameter logarithmic fit  i ) . from this statistical analysis",
    "we conclude that our specific heat data below 10  k has a clear logarithmic temperature behavior .",
    "it is remarkable that increasing order in ucu@xmath0pd does not destroy its nfl  behavior in the specific heat , but rather expands the temperature range of its logarithmic behavior .",
    "thus this work reports a new tuning parameter for nfl  behavior besides pressure @xcite , doping @xcite or magnetic field @xcite : crystallographic order .",
    "the splat cooled ucu@xmath20pd , as expected for the most disordered sample , shows however a completely different behavior .",
    "the temperature dependence is more like that of ucu@xmath26pd@xmath27 ( which has almost the same lattice parameter as our  splat cooled  sample , see fig .",
    "[ 1 ] ) as can be seen in figure [ 2]b ) .",
    "the electrical resistivity shows a particularly strong sensitivity to annealing .",
    "figure [ 3 ] shows the electrical resistivity of the unannealed and the annealed samples .",
    "the residual resistivity drops strongly by a factor of about  2.5 . also an enormous change in the qualitative behavior of the curve can be observed .",
    "while the resistivity of the unannealed sample increases continuously below 400 k , the resistivity of the annealed samples has a kondo  like minimum at about 35 k. in the temperature region between 2  k and 8  k our resistivity data for the 14 days annealed sample can be well  described by a fermi liquid expansion @xmath42 ( see the inset of figure [ 3 ] ) .",
    "the small upturn of the resistivity by about 0.5% below 1  k with an inkling of a maximum at 70  mk seen also in the inset of figure  [ 3 ] is so far not understood .",
    "it is also observed in the unannealed sample ( not shown here ) . except for this small upturn below 1  k",
    "we conclude that the behavior of the resistivity of the annealed sample is clearly no longer non  fermi liquid like with @xmath43 below 10  k as first reported by andraka and stewart @xcite for the unannealed case .",
    "in fact , the observed behavior of the resistivity below  10  k is neither consistent with fermi liquid nor with non  fermi liquid behavior with a unique power  law dependence .",
    "also notice that the sign of  @xmath44 in our fit is unusual for f ",
    "moments forming a kondo lattice .",
    "furthermore , a strong indication for a change of the ground state in this system is the change from a negative magnetoresistance at 1.8 k of the unannealed sample to a positive magnetoresistance of the annealed samples ( not shown ) .",
    "this indicates a transition from a spin disordered compound to a ",
    "normal  metal .",
    "finally , we observe that also the spin glass behavior found in unannealed ucu@xmath0pd @xcite is sensitive upon annealing . the spin glass temperature t@xmath45 determined from ac  susceptibility measurements shifts to lower temperature with decreasing frequency ( 95hz , 995hz ) in the unannealed sample @xcite . in the annealed samples we could still observe a maximum in the ac ",
    "susceptibility at 65 mk ( 7 days annealed ) and at 55 mk ( 14 days annealed ) , but no temperature shift with frequency ( not shown ) .",
    "this temperature shift of the maximum might be due to a suppression of the antiferromagnetic transition of the unannealed sample as recently discussed by krner et al .",
    "@xcite , supporting increasing order between the 7 days and 14 days annealed samples",
    ". further work on the effects of annealing upon spin glass behavior is in progress .",
    "summarizing , we have shown that in ucu@xmath0pd intrinsic order yields a new tuning parameter for nfl behavior in the specific heat in addition to the usual parameters doping , pressure , and magnetic field .",
    "therefore samples must also be characterized by their intrinsic order : x  ray line width and lattice parameter measurements indicate a rearrangement of the pd atoms from the 16e sites to the 4c sites in ucu@xmath0pd leading to increased sub - lattice order upon annealing .",
    "increasing order has a markedly different effect on the behavior of the specific heat and the resistivity : i ) a higher degree of crystallographic order suppresses the antiferromagnetic transition temperature t@xmath13 to @xmath25 0.08 k. the best ordered sample then shows a logarithmic behavior in c / t over more than two decades in temperature from 0.08  k to 10  k.    therefore annealing expands the range of nfl  behavior in the specific heat .",
    "ii ) on the other hand , the behavior of the resistivity in the annealed sample shows a @xmath46dependence with higher order corrections between 2  k and 8  k. in addition , the magnetoresistance changes sign : the non  fermi liquid behavior ( @xmath43 ) of the unannealed samples observed by andraka and stewart @xcite in the same temperature range thus vanishes for increased crystallographic order .    since the kondo disorder model would predict nfl ",
    "behavior for the specific heat ( logarithmic dependence of the sommerfeld coefficient on temperature @xcite ) _ and _ for the resistivity ( @xmath43 @xcite ) in about the same temperature range , this model is therefore clearly not applicable in annealed ucu@xmath0pd .",
    "with respect to unannealed ucu@xmath0pd , it seems furthermore plausible from figure 2a ) to expect that the low temperature behavior of its sommerfeld coefficient is due to the same physical mechanism as in annealed ucu@xmath0pd .",
    "thus , since disorder ( at least as understood in the kondo disorder model ) is not the underlying mechanism in c / t for nfl  behavior in annealed ucu@xmath0pd as shown above , it seems possible that it is not the origin for nfl  behavior in unannealed ucu@xmath0pd either . with respect to the griffiths phase model",
    "@xcite we have found that our specific heat data is not consistent with the theoretically predicted power  law behavior @xmath30 with @xmath31",
    ". therefore these two theoretical models which presuppose disorder for explaining the nfl  behavior in ucu@xmath0pd are not applicable .",
    "our observations lead support to a quantum critical point scenario that might reconcile our specific heat , susceptibility and resistivity data . further theoretical and experimental work , in particular @xmath47sr and nmr  studies on the annealed samples , is in progress in order to establish such a scenario .",
