    "the existence of nuclei with stable deformed shapes was realized early in the history of nuclear physics .",
    "the observation of large quadrupole moments led to the suggestion that some nuclei might have spheroidal shapes , which was confirmed by the observation of rotational band structures and measurements of their properties . for most deformed nuclei ,",
    "a description as an axial- and reflection - symmetric spheroid is adequate to reproduce the band s spectroscopy .",
    "because such a shape is symmetric under space inversion , all members of the rotational band have the same parity .",
    "however , with the first observation of negative parity states near the ground state , the possibility arose that some nuclei might have an asymmetric shape under reflection .    on the other hand , whenever symmetry breaking appears new behavior of the many - body system is expected .",
    "reflection symmetry breaking is associated with a static octupole deformation which is expected to determine new collective features for the nuclear system .",
    "extensive investigations into the structure of nuclei with low - lying negative parity states has led to the conclusion that , while reflection asymmetric shapes can play a role in the band structure , they are not as stable as the familiar quadrupole deformations",
    ". the rotational spectra of some even - even nuclei in the rare earth and light actinide region exhibit , next to the ground band , a negative parity band which consists of the states with @xmath1 .",
    "these two bands are displaced from each other , which means that fluctuations back to space symmetric shapes must also be significant .",
    "experimentally  the presence of `` octupole '' bands for some isotopes from the light actinide and rare earth region @xcite is firmly established .",
    "there is a large variety of models that try to describe this behaviour of the low - ling states of deformed nuclei .",
    "particularly successful are algebraic models based on symmetry principles .",
    "the introduction of an additional octupole degrees of freedom is a common feature of  most of those models .",
    "the prescription for describing negative parity states by the addition of an @xmath2  boson to the usual @xmath3 and @xmath4 of the ibm was first mentioned by iachello and arima @xcite .",
    "it was suggested @xcite that the inclusion of a @xmath5 boson to the @xmath6 and @xmath2 bosons may play an important role in the  description of these  collective  states .",
    "the coherent state method ( csm ) was applied by alonso et al . to the _ spdf _ @xmath7 hamiltonian with quadrupole and octupole interaction alonso .",
    "recently  a. a. raduta and d. ionescu @xcite have used a generalization of the csm .",
    "they suggested that both ground and octupole bands may be considered as being projected from a single deformed intrinsic state that exhibits both quadrupole and octupole deformations .",
    "another collective  model based on point symmetry group considerations ns1  has also been used very successfully for the description of the energy levels of the ground and octupole bands and reproduces odd - even staggering between these levels @xcite . in this model the octupole field is parametrized by irreducible representations of the octachedron point symmetry group .",
    "the introduction of an octupole degrees of freedom in the presence of comparatively large number of free parameters in all of these models allows for the reproduction of the experimental data of the energies of the negative parity states , at least in the low spin region .    in the beginning of the 1980 s a phenomenological algebraic model called the interacting vector boson model ( ivbm )",
    "was introduced @xcite .",
    "this model is a generalization of  the phenomenological broken @xmath7 symmetry model @xcite , which provided a good description of the low - lying ground  and  @xmath8  bands @xcite  of well deformed even - even nuclei .",
    "its advantages were incorporated into  the rotational limit of the ivbm ivbmrl , with an a good description of all the positive parity bands of nuclei in the rare earth and the actinide region . moreover ,",
    "the @xmath9 extension of the model contains such sequences of  @xmath7 multiplets , some of which proves to be convenient for the description of the low - lying negative parity bands @xcite .    with the recent advance of the experimental technique",
    "the investigated bands were extended to very high angular momenta @xcite .",
    "this motivated a new approach within the framework of the model aimed at a description of the first positive and negative bands , up to very high spins . in this new application , we make use of the symplectic extension of the ivbm @xcite .",
    "this allows these bands to be considered as yrast bands in the sense , that we take into account the states with a given @xmath10 which minimize the energy values with respect to @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath11 is the eigenvalue of the total number of bosons that build the basis states of the model .",
    "its eigenvalue changes  as @xmath12 in the infinite spaces of the boson representation of @xmath13 .",
    "when considering the dynamical symmetry of the symplectic extension of the model through the maximal compact subgroup @xmath14 , we obtain the exactly solvable rotational limit with a hamiltonian , diagonal in a basis defined by the irreducible representations of the corresponding chain of subgroups .",
    "the measured energies of the ground and octupole bands in even - even nuclei from the rare earth and actinide regions are reproduced in the model with rather good accuracy .",
    "the analysis of the obtained results shows that this is due to the appearance of a vibrational type term  that influences the yrast energies .",
    "this term also plays the role of an interaction between the two considered bands , and is  the reason  for the correct reproduction of the odd - even  staggering  of  their energies .",
    "we start with a brief review of the model s assumptions and definitions .",
    "the ivbm is based on the introduction of two kinds  of vector bosons ( called @xmath5 and @xmath15 bosons ) , that built up  the collective excitations in the nuclear system .",
    "the creation operators of these bosons are assumed to be @xmath16 vectors and they transform according to two independent fundamental representations ( 1,0 ) of the group @xmath7 . these bosons form a pseudospin  doublet of the @xmath17 group and differ in their pseudospin  projection @xmath18  the introduction of this additional degree of freedom leads to the extension of the @xmath7 symmetry to @xmath9 . then the operators    @xmath19    transform according to the fundamental representation @xmath20_{6}$ ] of the group @xmath9 .",
    "the annihilation operators are obtained by the conjugation @xmath21 and transform according to the conjugate @xmath7  representations ( 0,1)@xmath22 the bilinear products of the creation and annihilation operators of the two vector bosons generate the noncompact symplectic group @xmath13 @xcite : @xmath23    @xmath24    @xmath25    where @xmath26 are the usual clebsh - gordon coefficients and @xmath27 and @xmath28 define the transformational properties of ( [ generators ] ) under rotations .",
    "we consider @xmath13 to be the group of the dynamical symmetry of the model @xcite .",
    "hence the most general one and two - body hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of its generators .",
    "using commutation relations between the @xmath29 and @xmath30 , the full range of number of bosons preserving hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of operators @xmath31 : @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are phenomenological constants .",
    "being a noncompact group , the representations of @xmath13 are of infinite dimension , which makes it impossible to diagonalize the most general hamiltonian .",
    "the operators @xmath31 generate the maximal compact subgroup of @xmath13 , namely the group @xmath9 : @xmath35 so the even and odd unitary irreducible representations ( uir ) of @xmath13 split into an infinite but countable number of symmetric uir of @xmath9 of the type @xmath36=[n]_{6}$ ] , where @xmath37 for the even set ( see table 1 ) and @xmath38 for the odd set @xcite .",
    "these subspaces are of finite dimension , which simplifies the problem of diagonalization",
    ". therefore the _ complete _ spectrum of the system can be calculated only trough the diagonalization of the hamiltonian in the subspaces of _ all _ the uir of @xmath9 , belonging to a given uir of @xmath13 .",
    "the rotational limit @xcite of the model is further defined by the chain :    @xmath39    @xmath40\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ ( \\lambda , \\mu ) \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ ( n , t)\\ \\ k\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ l\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ t_{0 }   \\label{qnum}\\ ] ]    where the labels below the subgroups are the quantum numbers ( [ qnum])corresponding to their  irreducible representations .",
    "their values are obtained by means of standard reduction rules and are given in @xcite . in this limit",
    "the operators of the physical observables are the angular momentum operator @xmath41 and the truncated ( `` elliott '' )  quadrupole operator @xmath42 which define the algebra of @xmath7 .",
    "the operators  of  the  pseudospincomponents and the number of bosons @xmath11 : @xmath43;\\ \\ \\text{\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ } % \\ n=-\\sqrt{3}[a^{0}(p , p)+a^{0}(n , n)],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] define the algebra of @xmath17 .",
    "since the reduction from @xmath9 to @xmath16 is carried out by the mutually complementary groups @xmath7 and @xmath17 , their quantum numbers are related in the following way : @xmath44 making use of the latter we can write the basis as @xmath45_{6};(\\lambda , \\mu ) ; k , l , m;t_{0}\\rangle = \\mid ( n , t);k , l , m;t_{0}\\rangle   \\label{bast}\\ ] ] the ground state of the system is : @xmath46 which is the vacuum state for the @xmath13 group",
    ".      the basis states associated with the even irreducible representation of the @xmath47 can be constructed by the application of powers of raising generators @xmath29 of the same group .",
    "each raising operator will increase the number of bosons @xmath11 by two . as a result",
    "we get a realization of the reduction scheme @xcite :    @xmath48    the @xmath13 classification scheme for the @xmath7 boson representations for even value of the number of bosons @xmath11  is shown on table 1 .",
    "each row ( fixed @xmath11 ) of the table corresponds to a given irreducible representation of the @xmath9 .",
    "then the possible values for the pseudospin are @xmath49 @xmath50 and are given in the column next to the respective value of @xmath11 .",
    "thus when @xmath11 and @xmath51 are fixed , @xmath52 equivalent representations of the group @xmath7 arise .",
    "each of them is labelled by the eigenvalues of the operator @xmath53 defining the columns of table 1 .",
    "the same @xmath7 representations @xmath54 arise for the positive and negative eigenvalues of @xmath55 .",
    "hence , in the framework of the discussed boson representation of the @xmath47 algebra all possible irreducible representations of the group @xmath56 are determined uniquely through all possible sets of the eigenvalues of the hermitian operators @xmath11 and @xmath57 the equivalent use of the @xmath58 labels facilitates the final reduction to the @xmath16 representations , which define the angular momentum @xmath27 and its projection @xmath59 the multiplicity index @xmath60 appearing in this reduction is related to the projection of @xmath27 in the body fixed frame and is used with the parity ( @xmath61 )  to label the different bands ( @xmath62 ) in the energy spectra of the nuclei .",
    "we define the parity of the states as @xmath63 .",
    "this allows us to describe both positive and negative bands .",
    "the hamiltonian , corresponding to the considered , rotational limit of ivbm , is expressed in terms of the first and second order invariant operators of the different subgroups in the chain ( [ chain ] ) : @xmath64 where @xmath65 are the quadratic invariant operators of the @xmath66 - groups , @xmath67 is  of the @xmath16 second order casimir operator . as a result of the connections ( [ ntcon ] )",
    "the casimir operator @xmath68 with eigenvalue @xmath69 is expressed in terms of  the operators @xmath11 and @xmath51 : @xmath70    making use of the above relation , hamiltonian ( [ hl ] ) takes the form @xmath71 and is obviously diagonal in the basis ( [ bast ] ) labelled by the quantum numbers of the subgroups of group - subgroup chain ( [ chain ] ) .",
    "its eigenvalues are the energies of the basis states of the boson representations of @xmath13 : @xmath72    the  energy of the  ground state ( [ gs ] ) of the  system is obviously   @xmath50 .",
    "in this paper we modify the earlier application of the ivbm @xcite for the description of the first excited even and odd parity bands in order to reach much higher angular momentum states in both band types .",
    "we will apply the model to even- even deformed nuclei , which exhibit a low - lying negative parity band next to the ground band traditionally considered to be an octupole band @xcite . in order to do this",
    "we first have to identify these experimentally observed bands with the sequences of basis states for the even representation of @xmath13 given in table 1 .",
    "we choose the @xmath7 multiplet @xmath73 for a description of the ground band , whereas for the octupole band the @xmath7 multiplet @xmath74 is used . in terms of @xmath75",
    "this choice corresponds to @xmath76 for the positive @xmath77 and @xmath78 for the negative @xmath79 parity band , respectively .      in this way , in the framework of the symplectic extension of boson representations of number preserving @xmath9 symmetry we are able to consider  all even eigenvalues of the number of vector bosons @xmath11  with the corresponding set of pseudospins @xmath80    this approach is based on the fact that the energies ( [ erot ] ) increase with increasing of @xmath11 .",
    "we define the energies of each state with  given @xmath81  as yrast energy with respect to @xmath11 in the two considered@xmath82bands@xmath22 hence their minimum values  are obtained at @xmath83  for the ground band , and @xmath84  for the octupole band , respectively .",
    "so for the description of the ground band our choice corresponds to the sequence of states  with different numbers of bosons , @xmath85 . and pseudospin @xmath86 in the column labelled @xmath87 of table 1 .",
    "respectively for a description of the negative parity band , we choose the set of states  with quantum numbers @xmath88 and @xmath89 from the same column @xmath87 .  since these quantum numbers uniquely define the * *  * * @xmath7 multiplets , which reduce to the  corresponding values of the angular momenta  @xmath27 , the ground band belongs to the @xmath7 multiplet @xmath90  and the octupole band to @xmath91 . in the so defined @xmath7 representations for  each",
    "@xmath92  the maximal values of @xmath27 appear  for the first time  ( see table 1 . ) .     according to the correspondence identified above between the basis states @xmath93 and the experimental data on the ground and octupole bands , the last term in the energy formula ( [ erot ] ) vanishes .",
    "the phenomenological model parameters @xmath94 @xmath95 and @xmath96 are evaluated by a fit to the experimental data .",
    "their values obtained for some even - even deformed nuclei belonging to light actinides and rare earth region are given in table 2 .",
    "the second column gives the numbers of the experimental states used in the fitting procedure .",
    "the comparison between the experimental spectra  and our calculations using the values of the model parameters given in  table 2 . for the ground and octupole bands of the nuclei @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99",
    "is illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "all experimental data  are taken from  experdata .",
    "the agreement between the theoretical  values obtained  with only  four model parameters and the  experimental data  for all the  nuclei under consideration is  rather good .    applying the yrast conditions relating  @xmath11  and @xmath100",
    "the energies ( [ erot ] )  for two considered bands can be rewritten  as :    @xmath101    the new free parameters @xmath102 and @xmath103 are related to the  previous ones as  follows :    @xmath104    the values of @xmath105 and @xmath8 can be determined only from a fit to the positive band energies ,  while @xmath106 and @xmath103 are  estimated  from the negative ones , respectively .",
    "the values of the parameters ( [ lpar])determine the behavior of the energies of  the two bands and their position  with respect to each other . in some cases ( @xmath107 ) the two bands are almost parallel .",
    "the shift between them depends on the parameter @xmath108 when they are very close they interact through the @xmath27 -dependent interaction with a strength @xmath109    as a result of our theoretical assumptions we obtained a simple formula for the energy levels . from ( [ evr ] )",
    "we can see that eigenstates of the first positive and negative bands consists of rotational  @xmath110  and vibrational @xmath27  modes .",
    "the rotational  interaction is with equal strength  @xmath105 in both of the bands .",
    "the obtained values of the parameter @xmath106 are always negative , which means that the negative parity band is less vibrational than the positive one .      in the collective rotational spectra of deformed even - even nuclei in this mass region some fine structure effects as back - banding and staggering behavior",
    "are observed .",
    "odd - even staggering patterns between ground and octupole bands have been investigated recently @xcite . in order to test further our model we applied on the energies the staggering function defined as @xcite :    @xmath111    where @xmath112 this function is a finite difference of fourth order in respect to @xmath113 or of fifth order in respect to energy @xmath114 and is characteristic for the deviation of the rotational behavior from that of the rigid rotor .",
    "the calculated and experimental staggering patterns are illustrated in figure 2 .",
    "one can see a good agreement  with experiment , as well as the reproduction of the beat  patterns of  the staggering behavior .",
    "they occur in the  region where the  interaction  between the  two considered  bands is most strong  or they cross .",
    "the correct reproduction of the experimental staggering patterns is  due  to the interaction term @xmath115  in ( [ evr ] ) between the positive and negative parity bands , which is a result of the introduced notion of yrast energies in the framework of the symplectic extension of the ivbm .",
    "we have applied the interacting vector boson model for the description of the ground and octupole bands in some even - even rare earth and actinide nuclei up to very high spins . in spite of the simplicity of the model without introducing additional degrees of freedom we are  able to describe  both positive and  negative parity bands .",
    "this  is  due to the specific definition of the states parity depending  on the pseudospin quantum number @xmath51 .",
    "the successful reproduction of the experimental energies and of their odd - even staggering was achieved as a result of their consideration as yrast energies in respect to the number of phonon excitation @xmath11  that build the collective states .",
    "the introduction of this notion was possible , as we extended the ivbm to its symplectic dynamical symmetry  @xmath13 , which allows the change of the number of bosons that are the building blocks of the model hamiltonian .",
    "nevertheless  the hamiltonian remains with only few phenomenological parameters and is still exactly solvable . through the algebraic properties of the dynamical symmetry chain relations between @xmath116 and @xmath17 quantum numbers",
    "are  established . combining these relations with the notion of yrast  energies the physical meaning of each term of the hamiltonian",
    "is clarified . in the rotational limit of the model in addition to",
    "the rotational character of the considered bands an purely vibrational mode is appearing , which introduces also some interaction between them .",
    "this is the reason for the reproduction also of the fine effect of the structure of these bands .",
    "the obtained physically meaningful results are also simple and easy for use and they permit the application of the model to larger class of nuclei than the purely rotational ones .",
    "the symplectic extension of the interacting  vector boson model permits a richer classification of the states than its unitary  version and gives the possibility for a further consideration of other collective bands . in general the  model",
    "proves  appropriate for the  description of diverse nuclear structure problems .",
    "the authors are grateful for fruitful  discussions and help  on  the subject of this paper  to professors j. p. draayer , j. cseh and d. bonatsos .",
    "this work  was partially  supported by  bulgarian science committee under  contract number @xmath117 ."
