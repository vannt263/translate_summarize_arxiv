    "in qcd simulations at small lattice spacings @xmath0 , algorithms typically have severe problems in generating transitions between different topological sectors .",
    "this problem of topology freezing is expected to appear for any lattice discretization of the quark and gluon fields @xcite . for certain discretizations ,",
    "e.g.  chirally symmetric quarks , this problem is even present on coarser lattices@xcite . in specific cases it might be motivated to fix topology on purpose .",
    "for example , when using a mixed action setup with light overlap valence and wilson sea quarks , one observes a rather ill - behaved continuum limit @xcite .",
    "this is due to near - zero modes of the dirac operator in the valence sector , which are not compensated by corresponding modes in the sea . a possibility to circumvent",
    "this imbalance could be to restrict the lattice simulation to topological charge @xmath1 , where such near - zero modes are absent , e.g.  by employing topology conserving actions @xcite .",
    "methods to extract physically meaningful results from simulations at frozen or fixed topology have been proposed @xcite and tested @xcite in various models and theories . in this work",
    "we extend these methods by also including ordinary finite volume effects .",
    "such a combined treatment of both fixed topology and ordinary finite volume corrections is expected to be particularly important for qcd at light @xmath2 quark masses .",
    "we test our equations in su(2 ) yang - mills theory at fixed topology .",
    "in @xcite an equation has been derived relating a hadron mass @xmath3 obtained at fixed topological charge @xmath4 and finite volume @xmath5 to its counterpart @xmath6 at unfixed topology ( i.e.  the physically meaningful hadron mass ) , @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the second derivative of @xmath6 with respect to the @xmath9 angle at @xmath10 , and @xmath11 the topological susceptibility .",
    "this equation illustrates that fixed topology corrections are finite volume effects , i.e.  effects suppressed by inverse powers of @xmath5 .",
    "it is straightforward to extract a physical hadron mass @xmath6 from computations at fixed topology : one just has to fit eq .",
    "( [ eqn001 ] ) to the available fixed topology and finite volume hadron masses @xmath3 , where @xmath6 , @xmath8 and @xmath11 are the fit parameters ( examples of this procedure can be found in @xcite ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : result_tfv ] we show recent results for su(2 ) yang - mills theory ( standard plaquette action , gauge coupling @xmath12 , i.e.  lattice spacing @xmath13 @xcite ) .",
    "the static potential @xmath14 at separation @xmath15 ( which can be interpreted as a mass ) , has been computed in different topological sectors with topological charges @xmath16 and for different volumes @xmath17 ( @xmath18 gauge link configurations have been generated for each of the four volumes ) .",
    "note that the discrepancies between static potential results @xmath19 at different topological charges @xmath4 are clearly visible , in particular for small volumes @xmath5 .",
    "this demonstrates the necessity of using specific methods to properly deal with topological finite volume effects .",
    "the curves represent a single fit of eq .",
    "( [ eqn001 ] ) to the lattice static potential results @xmath19 .",
    "the fit is of good quality , i.e.  @xmath20 .",
    "the resulting @xmath21 is in excellent agreement with a corresponding standard computation at unfixed topology , which yields @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 as a function of @xmath24 .",
    "the curves represent the fit of the lattice static potential results to eq .",
    "( [ eqn001]).,width=377 ]",
    "usually lattice simulations are performed at finite spatial volume @xmath25 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "consequently , a hadron at @xmath26 will interact with images of itself , e.g.  at @xmath27 , @xmath28 or @xmath29 .",
    "such interactions cause a shift in the hadron mass compared to infinite spatial volume , as first derived in @xcite .    the corresponding equation to describe these ordinary finite volume corrections ( i.e.  finite volume corrections not related to fixed topology ) of the static potential in yang - mills theory is @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the mass of the lightest particle , i.e.  the @xmath33 glueball . in fig .",
    "[ fig : oft ] we confront this equation with lattice su(2 ) yang - mills results for @xmath34 and find excellent agreement ( again we have used @xmath12 and generated 4000 gauge link configurations for each of the eight volumes @xmath35 ) . for @xmath36 ordinary finite volume effects are negligible . for smaller @xmath37 , however , there are sizeable corrections , which need to be taken into account , in particular when using such volumes for computations at fixed topology as presented in the previous section . from the fit of eq .",
    "( [ eqn002 ] ) to the lattice results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : oft ] , one can even extract the @xmath33 glueball mass with remarkable precision , @xmath38 .",
    "this is in perfect agreement with the result obtained by a standard lattice computation of a glueball 2-point correlation function , @xmath39 @xcite .    the dependence of @xmath34 on the periodic spatial extension @xmath37 of the lattice ( at unfixed topology).,width=377 ]",
    "in the su(2 ) example discussed in section  [ sec001 ] it has been possible to analyze fixed topology results using eq .",
    "( [ eqn001 ] ) in a meaningful way , i.e.  without taking ordinary finite volume effects into account .",
    "since the mass of the lightest particle , the @xmath33 glueball , is quite large , ordinary finite volume effects are strongly suppressed for large volumes . as indicated by fig .",
    "[ fig : oft ] and as done in section  [ sec001 ] , one just has to discard volumes with @xmath40 . in qcd",
    "the situation is expected to be more difficult , because there the lightest particle , the pion , is much lighter than the @xmath33 glueball of su(2 ) yang - mills theory .",
    "moreover , lattice simulations of qcd , in particular at large volumes , are extremely demanding with respect to high performance computer resources .",
    "therefore , it is highly desirable to combine eqs .",
    "( [ eqn001 ] ) and ( [ eqn002 ] ) , i.e.  to obtain an expression describing both topological and ordinary finite volume corrections to hadron masses .",
    "to derive such an expression , one has to consider ordinary finite volume effects also at non - vanishing @xmath9 angles using equations analogous to ( [ eqn002 ] ) .",
    "these equations are the starting point for a lengthy calculation similar to that leading to eq .",
    "( [ eqn001 ] ) ( a detailed derivation of eq .",
    "( [ eqn001 ] ) can e.g.  found in @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting expression describing both topological and ordinary finite volume effects takes the form @xmath41 where ordinary finite volume effects for the topological susceptibility @xmath11 have been neglected , since they are expected to be tiny @xcite .",
    "note that in addition to the parameters @xmath6 , @xmath8 and @xmath11 , which are already present in eq .",
    "( [ eqn001 ] ) , there are four more parameters , @xmath32 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , characterizing combined topological and ordinary finite volume corrections .    in fig .",
    "[ fig003 ] ( top ) we show a plot similar to that from fig .",

    "( [ eqn001 ] ) with the fit parameters @xmath6 , @xmath8 and @xmath11 determined by a fit to the large volumes @xmath17 , where ordinary finite volume effects are negligible .",
    "there is a strong discrepancy between these curves and the lattice results for the small volumes @xmath46 .",
