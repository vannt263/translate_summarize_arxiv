    "the description of qcd using light - cone methods has little in common with the more traditional description using euclidean path integrals .",
    "in particular , the latter approach admits wilson s elegant criterion for confinement , that the functional average of the gauge invariant wilson loop @xmath6 fall off as @xmath7 as the area , @xmath8 , spanned by @xmath9 gets large  @xcite .",
    "further , for numerical work the path integral has a natural discretization by wilson s lattice gauge theory , which has been very effectively exploited for finer and finer lattices  @xcite .",
    "an appealing feature of lattice gauge theory is the manifest gauge invariance  there is no need for gauge fixing .",
    "although the lattice spacing breaks @xmath10 ( euclidean lorentz ) invariance , a discrete subgroup of @xmath10 remains , so that violations of @xmath10 are irrelevant in the continuum limit .    in sharp contrast , light - cone quantization is only truly useful in a completely fixed gauge @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , the principle advantage of quantization on a light front is the possibility of interpreting the resulting quantum system in the language of non - relativistic quantum mechanics  @xcite : the manifest space - time symmetry is a galilei subgroup of the poincar group generated by @xmath12 .",
    "a seventh generator @xmath0 plays the role of total newtonian mass and is also conserved .",
    "the time in this newtonian analogue is @xmath13 , and if one passes to an imaginary time formalism in which @xmath14 , one is led to a path integral formalism which has no easily interpreted relation to that of the original euclidean gauge theory .",
    "for example , it is not obvious how wilson s confinement criterion can be implemented in this approach .",
    "the problem is that the wilson line refers to curves in coordinate space , whereas the most effective way to exploit light - front dynamics is to replace @xmath15 by its conjugate @xmath16 .",
    "the closest one can get to coordinate space is the `` mixed '' space @xmath17 . recall that an @xmath18 rectangular wilson loop oriented in the time direction has the interpretation @xmath19 as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the lowest energy of a quark and anti - quark pinned to points separated by a distance @xmath1 . here",
    "we propose instead that we consider a quark and anti - quark pinned to parallel lines separated by a distance @xmath1 .",
    "if there is confinement , the lowest energy of this system should still be @xmath22 for large @xmath1 , with @xmath23 the string tension . for light - cone dynamics",
    ", we can retain @xmath0 conservation by orienting the parallel lines in the @xmath24 direction .",
    "as a first semi - classical illustration of how this setup works , imagine a pair of particles constrained to move on two such parallel lines and interacting ( in 3-space ) via a potential @xmath25 .",
    "then in the center of mass system the hamiltonian will be @xmath26 for very large @xmath1 we can approximate @xmath27 which is a stable approximation only for an _ attractive _ force @xmath28 . in that case",
    "the ground state energy will be , to a good approximation , @xmath29 yielding the potential @xmath30 , as desired .",
    "in the remainder of this paper we will study this idea in the context of gauge theories .",
    "for convenience we shall take the particles living on the lines ( 1-branes ) to be dirac fermions . for brevity , we shall call these constrained particles _",
    "branions_. the gauge fields will of course live in the @xmath31 dimensional `` bulk '' space - time . in section  [ theenergy ]",
    ", we address the problem of calculating the energy of a pair of 1-branes separated by a distance @xmath1 . in the weak coupling limit",
    "some sort of ladder approximation is appropriate .",
    "we study three versions of this approximation : the bethe - salpeter equation in feynman gauge and light - cone gauge , and a tamm - dancoff approximation  @xcite to the problem of minimizing the energy of such a system . for larger coupling ,",
    "the ladder approximation fails , and the only simplification available is to the planar diagrams of large @xmath2 qcd  @xcite . in section  [ scattering ] , we study the `` s - matrix '' for a branion on one line scattering off an anti - branion on the other through one - loop in light - cone gauge . for simplicity",
    "we assume the ( anti- ) branions couple to large @xmath2 qcd in the bulk and are in the ( @xmath4)@xmath2 representation of @xmath3 .",
    "we show in detail how asymptotic freedom emerges and exhibit all of the light - cone `` @xmath32 '' divergences which are shown to disappear if virtual momenta are taken on - shell in a particular way .",
    "we conclude in section  [ conclusion ] with some comments on how our proposal can be put to use in studying quark confinement using light - front methods .",
    "our purpose in studying separated 1-branes is to devise a light - front friendly method to extract the force between charged sources separated by a variable distance @xmath1 .",
    "the proposal is to minimize the system energy @xmath33 with the constraint that each 1-brane carries a non - zero charge or color , and to identify @xmath34 with the force , at least in certain regimes .",
    "because the sources are constrained to lines , rather than to points , this minimization involves the 1 + 1 dimensional quantum dynamics of the sources , and this puts certain limitations on possible applications .    *",
    "first of all it gives no useful information about sources that repel one another . in this case",
    "the minimum energy configuration is that with the sources at opposite ends of their respective 1-branes yielding a minimum energy independent of @xmath1 .",
    "this is no problem for settling the issue of confinement , since that requires the energy due to separated sources in an overall color singlet state .",
    "such sources will attract one another whether or not confinement is realized in the theory . *",
    "even if the sources attract one another , the physical meaning of the minimal energy as a function of @xmath1 can be clouded by the brane dynamics .",
    "for example , if the branions are massless and the actual interaction energy falls off only as @xmath35 ( i.e. confinement does not occur ) , the charge on each brane can spread to a size of order @xmath1 as @xmath36 so , although the minimal energy might fall off as @xmath37 , the coefficient is reduced compared to that of the actual potential . in that case",
    "the method would establish the absence of confinement but would not yield a direct measure of the interaction potential . giving the branions",
    "a mass would provide a limitation to the growth of the charge size , so that the asymptotic behavior of the minimal energy would exactly track that of the actual potential .",
    "* in the context of qcd , we expect confinement to show up as a linear growth @xmath22 in the minimal energy at large @xmath1 .",
    "however the brane dynamics would not automatically ensure ( via asymptotic freedom ) a valid weak coupling description of the opposite limit @xmath38 .",
    "that would require that _ all _ relevant momentum scales be large compared to @xmath39 : not only @xmath37 but also the momentum transfers involved in the binding dynamics . to track the force from a perturbative description at small @xmath1 to confinement at large @xmath1",
    "we require that the branions be very heavy : @xmath40 . here",
    "@xmath41 is the bohr radius for the coulombic bound state , and sets the size of charge distribution on each brane .",
    "if the inequality holds , the minimal energy will have a renormalization group improved coulombic behavior @xmath42 for @xmath43 and , if confinement occurs , a linear growth for @xmath44 .",
    "the behavior of the minimal energy for @xmath45 is reflective of the two branion composite system , and has no direct interpretation as an effective force between two point sources .",
    "weak coupling methods ( valid in qcd for short distance phenomena ) can only effectively describe bound states close to threshold , that is when the bound state mass @xmath46 in the zero coupling limit .",
    "this is a nonrelativistic regime : in the center of mass system energy transfers and the squares of momentum transfers are of order @xmath47 . because energy transfers are much smaller than momentum transfers , the propagators of exchanged gluons describe effectively instantaneous interactions , and the nonrelativistic schrdinger equation is applicable .",
    "this nonrelativistic dynamics can be identified in quantum field theory in a number of ways which we shall address below . for large distances , where @xmath48 , a full - fledged nonperturbative treatment is required .",
    "we advocate an approach based on summing the planar graphs of t hooft s large @xmath2 limit .",
    "this limit leads to important simplifications , both because it suppresses pair production and because only planar graphs need be summed .",
    "unfortunately , in the continuum theory no further simplification is possible .",
    "but we think it particularly interesting to consider a strong t hooft coupling limit in the context of light - cone quantization with discretization of both @xmath0 and @xmath49 .",
    "of course , this limit takes one far from the continuum theory , but it is likely to be described by string theory  @xcite .",
    "this possibility has been strengthened recently by developments surrounding the maldacena conjecture  @xcite .    in the remainder of this section",
    "we discuss the energy of two 1-brane sources in the weak coupling limit of threshold binding .",
    "we consider the configuration of a branion anti - branion pair each confined to @xmath50-dimensional branes separated by a transverse distance @xmath51 .",
    "the gauge fields , which take values in the lie algebra of @xmath52 , live in the @xmath53-dimensional bulk space - time .",
    "our model is therefore described by the lagrangian , @xmath54\\psi_1 \\nonumber\\\\ + \\delta({\\bf x - r})\\overline{\\psi}_2\\left[i\\gamma^\\alpha ( \\partial_\\alpha - ig a_\\alpha)-m\\right]\\psi_2 \\ , , \\label{lagrangian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the index @xmath55 only runs over brane coordinates .",
    "the field strengths are given by @xmath56 $ ] .",
    "note that with this normalization @xmath57 .",
    "it is useful to identify a subset of graphs which is responsible for binding in this regime as a starting point for understanding what happens as the coupling is increased .",
    "as @xmath1 increases from small values , we can begin to see gradually how more complicated diagrams become important .",
    "optimistically this inside - out approach may provide a framework for understanding the dynamics of confinement in the large @xmath2 limit .",
    "of course we expect weak coupling binding to be captured by the sum of ladder diagrams or by the associated bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "we first discuss that approach .",
    "ladder diagrams are gauge dependent , but that dependence should disappear in the non - relativistic binding regime .",
    "we shall confirm this expectation by examining the ladder approximation in both feynman and light - cone gauges .",
    "later we shall show how tamm - dancoff truncation can capture the same physics .",
    "we write the integral equation describing the ladder sum for the channel where a branion ( with 2-momentum @xmath58 ) moves on a 1-brane oriented parallel to the @xmath59-axis passing through @xmath60 and an anti - branion ( of 2-momentum @xmath61 ) moves on a parallel 1-brane passing through @xmath62 . call the green function , describing the coupling of the branion and anti - branion to a bound system of 2-momentum @xmath63 , @xmath64",
    ". then @xmath65 in this equation minkowski two - vectors are denoted @xmath66 , etc . while vectors in the @xmath67-plane are indicated by bold face type .    in feynman gauge @xmath68 . in the non - relativistic binding regime and in the center of mass system , @xmath69 while @xmath70 .",
    "thus , for @xmath71 , @xmath72 can be neglected in the denominator of the propagator , and only @xmath73 appears on the r.h.s .",
    "putting @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and integrating both sides with respect to @xmath76 yields by contour integration @xmath77 in the center of mass system @xmath78 and @xmath79 , the mass of the bound system , is expected to be @xmath80 .",
    "thus the first term on the r.h.s .",
    "is much larger than the second and , neglecting momenta small compared to @xmath81 , the equation reduces to @xmath82 this equation implies that @xmath83 , so that only @xmath84 contributes in the contraction of the gamma matrices .",
    "the projection operators can be deleted and the equation thus reduces to @xmath85 which is just the momentum space representation of the nonrelativistic schrdinger equation @xmath86    the reduction is a bit more efficient in light - cone gauge , wherein the only relevant component of the gluon propagator is @xmath87 . in the nonrelativistic regime",
    "the particles on the branes have energies of order @xmath88 but momenta of order @xmath89 so that the momentum transfer @xmath90 .",
    "thus we can make the replacement @xmath91 in the bethe - salpeter equation , which with the following definition @xmath92 , takes the form , @xmath93\\hat g(p , q ) & \\approx&2g^2n_c\\int { d{\\bf k}d{k^+}\\over(2\\pi)^3 } e^{i{\\bf k}\\cdot{\\bf r } } { \\hat g(p - k , q+k)\\over { \\bf k}^2 + 2k^{+2 } } \\nonumber\\\\ & \\approx&{g^2n_c\\over2\\pi^2}\\int dk^+ k_0(\\sqrt2|k^+|r)\\hat g(p - k , q+k ) .",

    "thus by changing variables , @xmath104 , we regain eq.([nrbs ] ) .      in 2-dimensions the branion dirac spinors have two components ( see eq .",
    "( [ lagrangian ] ) ) , however , in light - cone quantization with @xmath105 , they are not independent .",

    "the divergent coefficients are due to the zero thickness of the brane , not the uv singularities of the bulk field theory .",

    "we shall only see the effect of these terms in the one - loop branion self energy , where it can be absorbed into mass and wave function renormalization .",
    "more generally when the four branion vertex from these terms is combined with the corresponding exchange graphs , the most severe quadratic divergence cancels leaving a net logarithmic divergence .",

    "in this paper we have proposed a light - front friendly way to extract the interaction energy between two sources in a gauge theory .",
    "we have analyzed the method in several ways at weak coupling .",
    "but the larger motivation for this proposal is to develop a framework within a light - cone quantization approach for establishing quark confinement in non - abelian gauge theories .",
    "consider , for example , the t hooft limit of @xmath221 , which is well known to reduce to summing planar graphs .",
    "another version of this limit interprets the sum of planar diagrams on a light front as the quantum dynamics of a gluonic chain  @xcite . without the notion of pinned sources",
    ", these chains would be dynamical bound states , and the concept of a confining force would have to be indirectly inferred from the excitation spectrum of these chains . in ordinary equal time quantization , the concept of a wilson loop allows a direct definition of the confining force , however the possibility of vacuum fluctuations clouds the chain interpretation of the large @xmath2 limit .",
    "our goal was to modify the wilson criterion to make it suitable for light front physics .    in light - cone quantization the sum of planar diagrams coupled to two separated 1-branes can be interpreted as the dynamics of a nonrelativistic chain of gluons vibrating in the transverse space and stretched between the points in transverse space marking the locations of the 1-branes .",
    "since the @xmath16 of each gluon and branion is dynamical , the newtonian mass of each of these objects varies ; but in such a way that the total mass is conserved  @xcite .",
    "this picture is made more concrete when the @xmath16 is discretized , @xmath222 , where @xmath94 is a large integer , and @xmath81 is the discrete unit of @xmath16 .",
    "we hope that pinning the ends of the chain to points will offer conceptual and technical simplifications to the problem of assessing whether the dynamics of the chain leads to a confining force .",
    "although the dynamics of continuum gauge theories generically involves a scale dependent coupling which is presumably never actually much larger than unity , the introduction of an ultraviolet cutoff allows a formal strong coupling limit .",
    "for example , the discretization of @xmath49 ( in addition to @xmath16 ) provides such a cutoff  @xcite . in that context",
    "the strong t hooft coupling limit favors large planar fishnet diagrams , which should behave as seamless world sheets . in this limit",
    "then the sum of planar diagrams coupled to our 1-branes would correspond to a fundamental light - cone string stretched between them , and therefore a confining force would emerge .",
