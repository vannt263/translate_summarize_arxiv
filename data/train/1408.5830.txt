    "<S> single crystal x - ray diffraction , magnetic susceptibility , heat capacity , and electrical resistivity measurements are reported for the new tetragonal compound ce@xmath0pdge@xmath1 , which forms in the space group @xmath2 ( # 131 ) @xmath3 a relative of the @xmath4-thsi@xmath5-type structure . </S>",
    "<S> measurements reveal a two - part antiferromagnetic phase transition at @xmath6 @xmath7 10.7 k and @xmath8 @xmath7 9.6 k and subsequent ferromagnetic ordering near @xmath9 @xmath10 2.25 k. the ordered ground state emerges from a lattice of ce ions that are hybridized with the conduction electrons , as revealed by the enhanced electronic coefficient of the specific heat @xmath11 @xmath10 50 mj / mol - ce - k@xmath12 ( extrapolated to @xmath13 @xmath7 0 for @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath9 ) . </S>",
    "<S> electronic structure calculations suggest that there is significant f - electron weight in the density of states near the fermi energy and that the fermi surface includes sheets with distinct nesting vectors . </S>",
    "<S> chemical / structural disorder also plays an important role , as evidenced by results from single crystal x - ray diffraction , the width of the peaks in the heat capacity at @xmath15 and @xmath9 , and the small residual resistivity ratio rrr @xmath7 @xmath16/@xmath17 @xmath7 1.8 .    </S>",
