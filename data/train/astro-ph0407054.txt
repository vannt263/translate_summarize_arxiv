    "globular clusters ( gc ) are co - eval , gravitationally bound stellar systems containing between @xmath1  and @xmath2  stars .",
    "stellar densities in the cores of gcs are often extremely high and can reach @xmath2  stars per cubic parsec .",
    "close encounters between cluster members are therefore relatively common , which makes gc cores fantastic stellar crash test laboratories .",
    "the most extreme type of close encounter is a direct physical collision between two stars .",
    "it has been estimated that up to 40%  of the stars in the cores of the densest gcs may have suffered such a collision during their lifetime.@xcite one possible outcome of such a collision is a rejuvenated main sequence star that is more massive ( and therefore hotter ) than either of its two progenitors .",
    "such collision products may be found along an extension of the cluster main sequence ( ms ) , but bluewards of the ms turn - off .",
    "they are thus usually referred to as `` blue stragglers '' ( bss ) and are observed in essentially all galactic gcs.@xcite    near misses are even more common than direct collision and are thought to produce numerous close binary systems ( cbs ) .",
    "the tightest and most interesting cbs are those containing at least one compact object , i.e. a white dwarf ( wd ) or a neutron star ( ns ) .",
    "the most important and extreme compact binaries are those that are so tight that the ( usually ms ) companion of the compact object can not fit into its `` roche lobe '' , i.e. its part of the dumb - bell - shaped critical gravitational potential of the binary .",
    "matter then flows from the companion to the compact object via the inner lagrangian point , in a process called roche lobe overflow .",
    "the material lost by the mass donor is ultimately accreted by the compact object , but in doing so releases significant amounts of gravitational potential energy .",
    "most of this emerges as radiation in the x - ray and/or far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) wavebands .",
    "if the accreting compact object is a ns , the system is called a low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) ; if it is a wd , the system is called a cataclysmic variable ( cv ) . for more information on these types of accreting binaries ,",
    "see ref .",
    "( for lmxbs ) and ref .",
    "( for cvs ) .",
    "there are several ways to create accreting compact binaries via dynamical encounters in gc cores .",
    "the first and most famous is tidal capture .",
    "this is a 2-body interaction which relies on the high stellar densities in the cluster core to bring a ns or wd very close to a ms star .",
    "the ms star then experiences tidal distortions which dissipate orbital energy , and can lead to capture and binary formation.@xcite however , compact binaries can also be formed via processes involving existing binaries , i.e. 3- and 4-body interactions .",
    "for example , in a close encounter between a low - mass ( e.g. ms / ms ) binary system and a high mass ( e.g. ns ) single star , the most likely outcome is ejection of the lowest mass participant and formation of a ns / ms binary system.@xcite    tidal capture was originally proposed in order to account for the observed 100-fold overabundance of lmxbs in gcs ( relative to the galactic field).@xcite however , this and other dynamical formation processes might be expected to create a similar overabundance of cvs .",
    "if so , the number of cvs should far outstrip the number of lmxbs , since wds are far more common than nss .",
    "for example , the authors of ref .",
    "predict that roughly 200 cvs produced by tidal capture should exist today in 47  tucanae , and ref .",
    "notes that there could be an additional 100 or so formed via 3-body interactions ( as well as perhaps another 300 systems in the cluster outskirts that are descended directly from primordial binaries ) . however , finding these systems proved to be a serious observational challenge , and only recent surveys with modern , space - based x - ray ( refs .  ; see refs .   for the most detailed follow - up to one of these x - ray surveys to date . ) and far - ultraviolet detectors ( refs .  ) are beginning to reveal a sizeable population of cvs in gcs . whether this population is large enough to match",
    "the theoretical predictions remains to be seen ( see also section  [ state_image ] ) .",
    "once they are formed , the dynamically - created stellar populations can actually themselves become key players in controlling further cluster evolution . in other words ,",
    "the `` interplay '' between cluster dynamics and stellar evolution is very much a two way street .",
    "cbs are particularly important in this context , since the binding energy of even a single very close binary can rival that of an entire modest - size globular cluster ( gc ) . as a result ,",
    "the dynamical evolution of a gc can in principle be driven by just a few close binaries among its population . in practice , these binaries drive cluster evolution by transferring their orbital energy to passing single stars .",
    "close binaries thus `` harden '' , while promoting cluster expansion and evaporation on a time - scale somewhat longer than a hubble time ( see , for example , ref .  ) .",
    "all of the most interesting dynamically - formed stellar populations ",
    "bss , lmxbs and cvs  share a key observational characteristic : their spectral energy distributions are much bluer than those of `` normal '' cluster stars .",
    "this immediately implies that fuv imaging should be an excellent way to find and study these populations . however , the fuv waveband has historically been almost inaccessible to gc imaging studies .",
    "the reason for this is simple : fuv imagers with the sensitivity and spatial resolution required to locate faint fuv - excess objects in gc cores ( and without significant red leaks ) simply did not exist .    the arrival of first the _ space telescope imaging spectrograph _",
    "( stis ) and now the _ advanced camera for surveys _ ( acs ) on the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) has radically improved this situation .",
    "both of these instruments feature sensitive , solar - blind uv detectors whose spatial resolution ( @xmath3 ) is actually _",
    "better _ than that of most of hst s optical imagers . as a consequence",
    ", the first truly deep , far - uv imaging studies of gc cores are finally being carried out.@xcite . in this short review , i will present the first results that have come out of these studies in relation to the dynamically - formed stellar populations and look forward to how this field is likely to develop in the near future .",
    "deep fuv observations have so far been published for only two clusters : 47 tuc ( work by our own group ; refs .  ) and ngc  2808 ( ref .  ) .",
    "however , ref   was focused primarily on hot , subluminous horizontal branch stars , which are not obviously affected by dynamical encounters .",
    "thus only our own fuv work on 47  tuc has so far focused on the dynamically - formed stellar populations . as a result ,",
    "the discussion in this section is necessarily limited to only one cluster .",
    "however , our fuv survey of 47  tuc did include both imaging and slitless spectroscopy components , so i will present the results emerging from our application of these two methods in turn .",
    "we had two reasons for taking the prototypical cluster 47  tuc as our initial fuv target .",
    "first , its observational properties  in particular , the angular size of its core and the lack of unduly fuv - bright blue horizontal branch stars  turn out to be well - matched to the requirements of a fuv survey .",
    "second , most of the theoretical work on dynamically formed stellar populations has used this cluster as a point of reference , so there are some clear predictions for what we _ should _ see .    in total",
    ", we obtained thirty orbits of stis / hst observations of 47 tuc , comprised of six epochs of five orbits each ( hst program go-8219 ) . in each epoch , we carried out fuv imaging and slitless spectroscopy .",
    "consecutive observing epochs were as closely spaced as a few days and as widely separated as a year .",
    "typical exposure times in the fuv were 600  s. our program is therefore sensitive to variability on time - scales ranging from minutes to months .",
    "this is important , since accreting binaries tend to be variable on all of these time - scales .",
    "all of our fuv observations ( both imaging and spectroscopic ) used the fuv - mama detectors and were taken through the f25qtz filter .",
    "the purpose of this filter is to block geocoronal ly@xmath4 , oi 1304    and oi ] 1356    emission which would otherwise produce a high background across the detector ( this is especially important for our slitless spectroscopy ) .",
    "the effective bandpass with this instrumental set - up is 1450      1800   .",
    "the 1024@xmath51024 pixel fuv - mama detector covers approximately 25@xmath525 , at a spatial resolution of about 0.043  ( fwhm ) .",
    "our field of view ( fov ) was chosen to overlap with archival hst observations of 47  tuc and included the cluster center . for comparison",
    ", the core radius of 47  tuc is 23 .@xcite    figure  1 shows a comparison of the f336w and fuv images of the same 25@xmath525  field near the core of 47  tuc .",
    "note that the optical image is vastly more crowded , because the majority of main - sequence stars , red giants and horizontal branch stars are too cool to show up in the fuv exposure .",
    "this is perhaps _ the _ key advantage of fuv over optical surveys .",
    "we have overlayed onto the fuv image the predicted positions of known blue sources from ref .   and also",
    "the predicted positions of the chandra x - ray sources from ref .",
    "almost all of the blue sources listed by ref .   have certain or likely fuv counterparts .",
    "this was to be expected , but is nevertheless important : it provides an external check on our astrometry and supports our contention that fuv imaging is an excellent way of finding interesting gc sources .",
    "we find fewer obvious fuv counterparts to the x - ray sources found by ref .   within our fov .",
    "this is not so surprising , given that approximately 70% of their sources are expected to be very faint fuv sources ( millisecond pulsars and x - ray active main sequence binaries ) .",
    "a more interesting question is whether we detect those chandra sources that are definitely expected to be fuv bright .",
    "there are four such sources within our fov , all of which were classified by ref .   as likely cvs .",
    "three of these are thought to be associated with previously known or suspected cvs , namely ako  9 , v1 and v2 ; all three are also clearly detected in our fuv images ( and indeed confirmed as cvs by our fuv spectroscopy ; see section  [ state_spec ] ) .",
    "the fourth source  denoted w15 in ref .",
    " is a cv candidate that was not known prior to the chandra survey of 47  tuc .",
    "it , too , has a likely counterpart in our fuv images ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "figure  2 shows the fuv - optical color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of 47  tuc .",
    "several distinct stellar populations are present in cmd , among them wds , bss , msto stars and , last but not least , cvs . in order to aid in the interpretation of the cmd ,",
    "we have also calculated and plotted a set of theoretical tracks .",
    "two types of dynamically - formed populations can be spotted immediately .",
    "first , the bs sequence can be seen as a trail of stars starting at the ms turn - off and moving upwards and to the left .",
    "the slight discrepancy between the observed bs sequence and the synthetic one is to be expected , since the latter assumes that the bss lie on the zams . in reality , bss are likely to be somewhat evolved , explaining their location above and to the red of the zero - age main sequence . in total , there are 19 bss in our color - magnitude diagram , extending all the way from the ms turn - off ( at approximately 0.9  m@xmath6 ) to perhaps 1.5  m@xmath6 .",
    "four of these ( circled in figure  2 ) appear to be variable in our fuv photometry .",
    "this is reasonable , given that variability among bss in 47  tuc has been observed previously.@xcite thus fuv imaging is indeed an excellent way to locate bss in dense gc cores .",
    "the second type of dynamically - formed population present in the cmd is cataclysmic variables . given that cvs are binary systems containing an accreting wd and ( usually ) a ms star , we expect them to be located between the wd cooling sequence on one side and the ms ( and its bs extension ) on the other .",
    "we refer to this area of the cmd as the `` cv zone '' .",
    "there are 16 objects in the cv zone , not including the star just off the lower left of the msto .",
    "how many of these sources are likely to be real cvs ?    four objects in the cv zone ",
    "ako  9 , v1 , v2 and w15  are already strong or confirmed cv candidates .",
    "all of these sources are fuv bright and variable , and all are chandra x - ray sources that were also classified as likely cvs in ref .  .",
    "as discussed further below , ako  9 , v1 and v2 have also already been confirmed spectroscopically as cvs , via the detection of fuv emission lines ( the spectroscopy of ako  9 has already been published in ref .  ) . since we have been able to easily recover all four previously known cv candidates in our field of view  including one that was only recently discovered by chandra  we conclude that fuv imaging is indeed a powerful way of finding these systems .",
    "the status of the remaining 12 sources in the cv zone is discussed further in ref .  , but the bottom line is that their nature is still unclear .",
    "they probably include some chance superpositions , some non - interacting wd+ms binaries and perhaps one or two background stars located in the small magellanic cloud behind 47 tuc .",
    "however , some of them might yet turn out to be cvs , as might additional fuv sources on or near the wd cooling sequence and fuv sources without any optical counterparts . depending on how many of these will ultimately turn out to be cvs , the observed and predicted ( by tidal capture theory ) number of cvs differ by at most a factor of three , but might even be consistent with each other.@xcite .",
    "recent x - ray based searches for cvs also find evidence for sizeable populations of cvs in gcs.@xcite      as already noted above , the great advantage of moving to the fuv waveband is that the vast majority of `` ordinary '' cluster members are too cool to show up , thus eliminating the crowding problem that usually plagues optical surveys of gc cores .",
    "since crowding is not a serious issue in the fuv , it is possible to carry out slitless , multi - object spectroscopy of an entire cluster core and thus obtain spectra for all fuv bright sources simultaneously .",
    "we used this method on 47  tuc , and figure  3 shows an example of the slitless spectra we obtained .",
    "each trail in this image corresponds to the dispersed image of a fuv point source ( c.f .",
    "figure  1 ) .",
    "the sharp cut - off at the left hand side of each trail is due to the abrupt decrease in sensitivity around 1450   , where the quartz filter becomes opaque .",
    "the brightest source in this spectral image is ako  9 , an object already noted as a likely cv based on photometric and x - ray data ( see previous section ) .",
    "even a cursory look at the raw data shows that there are two bright emission lines in its spectrum , immediately confirming it as a cv .",
    "since ako  9 is extremely bright and relatively isolated , its spectrum can be extracted fairly straightforwardly from the spectral images ( see ref .   for details ) .",
    "figure  4 shows the extracted and calibrated fuv spectrum of ako  9 , as constructed from the fuv spectra obtained in all observing epochs ( but excluding points affected by the eclipse in this high inclination binary ) .",
    "as expected from the raw , 2-d spectral image in figure  3 , the calibrated 1-d spectrum contains extremely strong c  iv and he  ii emission lines , which are superposed on a blue continuum .",
    "all of these characteristics are consistent with ako  9 being a dwarf - nova type cv , thus confirming its accreting binary nature .",
    "our time - resolved photometry and spectroscopy also allowed us to finally resolve an almost decade - old puzzle surrounding ako  9 . more specifically , the authors of ref .   observed an `` unusual brightening '' of the system , during which its u - band flux increased by 2  mag in less than two hours",
    "if this brightening is interpreted as a genuine increase in the system s luminosity , the short time scale of the event poses serious problems for essentially all models for this system  including the cv model .",
    "however , as described in ref .  , our time - resolved data allows us to define a precise eclipse ephemeris for this system , which in turn shows that the brightening seen in ref .",
    "was , in fact , an eclipse egress that happened to be observed at a time when ako  9 was already in a high state ( i.e. during a dwarf nova eruption ) .",
    "the `` unusual brightening '' thus turns out to be completely consistent with the cv nature of ako  9 .",
    "a close look at the spectral image in figure  4 also reveals another emission line source , located roughly 20% below ako  9 . this source is the dwarf nova - type cv v2.@xcite furthermore",
    ", we have also already confirmed that another previously suspected cv candidate  an object known as v1 ( see ref .  )  exhibits emission lines ( this is not immediately apparent in the 2-d spectral image ) .",
    "figure  5 shows quick - and - dirty extractions of the fuv spectra of these two objects ; the emission lines are clearly visible and confirm the cv status of v1 and v2 . the remaining x - ray selected cv candidate in our imaging field of view ( denoted w15 in ref .  )",
    "is unfortunately just outside the spectroscopic field of view .",
    "the example of ako  9 ( and also v1 and v2 ) nicely demonstrates the power of moving to the fuv : by shifting to this waveband , we were able to obtain time - resolved , multi - object spectroscopy simultaneous for ako  9 , v1 , v2 and all other bright fuv sources .",
    "this powerful and efficient technique would be impossible to apply in the optical region , due to the severe crowding there .",
    "our fuv imaging observations of 47  tuc clearly illustrate the unique advantages offered by this waveband for finding and studying the dynamically - formed stellar populations in gcs .",
    "we have therefore already been granted additional hst time to observe five other gcs with hst / stis and/or hst / acs . in addition , two gcs ",
    "ngc  2808 and ngc  6881  are actually used as calibration targets by hst and thus already have extensive fuv imaging data sets in the hst archive .",
    "thus we are well on the way towards the construction of a sizeable archive of fuv imaging data on gcs .",
    "most of this data is already in hand , and our group is working hard to reduce and analyse it all .",
    "as one example of the progress currently being made , figure  6 shows the combined fuv image of ngc  2808 .",
    "as already noted above , this data set has already been analyzed in ref .   with an emphasis on hot subluminous horizontal branch stars .",
    "however , their fuv / nuv color - magnitude diagram clearly showed both a bs sequence and objects in the cv zone , so we are now revisiting these observations with a focus on the dynamically - formed stellar populations ( e.g. by means of searching for variability among the bss and cv candidates ; dieball et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "similar progress is being made on the other clusters for which fuv data is already available , and initial fuv - imaging publications should soon be available on m15 ( shara et al . , submitted [ confirmation of one particular cv ] ; dieball et al .",
    ", in preparation [ work on the full fuv data set ] ) , ngc  1851 and ngc  6681 ( zurek et al . , in preparation ) , and also ngc  6752 and ngc  6397 ( shara et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "thus the next year or so should see rapid growth in this exciting area .",
    "as described in section  [ state_spec ] , the lack of crowding in the fuv waveband makes it possible to carry out slitless , multi - object spectroscopy even in the core of a gc .",
    "however , the results we have so far obtained from our spectroscopic survey of 47  tuc  in particular , confirmation of ako  9 , v1 and v2 as cvs by virtue of strong emission lines in their fuv spectra ",
    "still only scratch the surface of this phenomenal data set .",
    "most importantly , our spectral images contain reasonable quality spectra of many additional objects in the `` cv zone '' ( see section  [ state_image ] ) and thus might allow us to confirm or rule out the cv nature of these objects .",
    "in addition , many bss and wds should be bright enough to allow their spectra to be extracted .",
    "however , these sources are generally fainter and less well isolated than ako  9 , so extracting their spectra is considerably more difficult . in particular , the extraction must take into account blending between neighboring sources .",
    "luckily , spectral extraction software for this type of data already exists.@xcite .",
    "we are therefore currently working with the authors of the software to apply their technique to our data .",
    "thus fuv spectra of several additional cv candidates and bss in 47  tuc will soon become available ( knigge et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "the goal of this short review has been to demonstrate the great benefits of moving to the fuv waveband when studying hot , dynamically - formed stellar populations in globular clusters .",
    "the most important advantage of the fuv waveband is that ordinary cluster members are too cool to show up as fuv sources , whereas all of the most interesting stellar populations in gcs  blue stragglers , accreting binaries , but also young white dwarfs  are strong fuv emitters . as a result ,",
    "fuv images suffer from much less crowding than optical ones , and almost every moderately bright fuv source is bound to be an interesting object .",
    "these expected advantages are completely borne out by our first fuv imaging survey of 47  tuc , in which we have been able to identify many bss and cv candidates .    since crowding",
    "is not a problem in the fuv , we have even been able to carry out slitless , multi - object spectroscopy in the very core of 47  tucanae .",
    "this is an extremely efficient way of obtaining spectroscopic classifications of interesting sources , but is completely impossible in the optical waveband . in 47",
    "tuc , our fuv spectral images have already allowed us to confirm the cv nature of several bright fuv sources in this cluster .    in closing",
    ", i would like to emphasize that deep fuv imaging and spectroscopy of gcs is extremely powerful and is definitely a growth industry .",
    "thus while deep fuv observations have been published for only two clusters so far , work by our group alone should at least triple this number over the coming months .",
    "the fuv project described in this review is very much a joint effort with my collaborators dave zurek , mike shara , knox long , ron gilliland and andrea dieball . the financial support of the uk s particle physics and research council for my work in this area is gratefully acknowledged . much of this review has been based on refs .  , which are   2002,2003 the american astronomical society ( all rights reserved ) ."
