    "observational studies of molecular supershells have the power provide constraints on theories of triggered cloud and star formation , and to accurately pinpoint locations at which such triggering may be occurring . yet , with a handful of exceptions @xcite , supershells with a significant molecular component remain relatively understudied .    the co molecule has been widely and successfully used as a tracer of the molecular ism , and has formed the basis of many large - scale surveys of the galactic molecular disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "this paper presents a catalogue of co molecular clouds in the region of the ` carina flare ' supershell ( gsh 287 + 04 - 17 ) .",
    "the carina flare is an hi - h@xmath7 supershell located in the near side of the carina arm at @xmath8 kpc .",
    "it was first discovered in @xmath0co(j=1 - 0 ) with the nanten 4 m telescope by @xcite , who reported the discovery of an extensive , expanding complex of molecular clouds reaching as high as @xmath9 pc above the galactic plane .",
    "comparisons with hi 21 cm survey data confirmed that the majority of the mass in this molecular complex  as well as much additional lower - latitude material ",
    "forms co - moving parts of a gently expanding atomic supershell @xcite .",
    "this supershell extends from @xmath10 to @xmath11 , covering a total projected area of @xmath12 square degrees , with a main body @xmath13 pc in size , and a capped , high - latitude extension .",
    "the total associated molecular mass is estimated as @xmath14 , which amounts to @xmath15 of the total neutral gas mass , and this molecular component is associated with a rich variety of substructural features in the atomic shell . moreover ,",
    "several molecular clouds show evidence for active star formation , suggesting triggering may be occurring @xcite .",
    "previous work has discussed the macroscopic distribution and properties of the carina flare molecular ism .",
    "however , detailed data on individual clouds , as well as the statistical properties of the sample as a whole , have not previously been published . here",
    "we present the first comprehensive catalogue of the cloud population , intended both as a complement to past work , and as a resource upon which future studies of the region may draw .",
    "the present study includes observations in both @xmath0co(j=1 - 0 ) and @xmath1co(j=1 - 0 ) .",
    "the @xmath0co line , which is generally assumed to be optically thick , is an excellent tracer of the overall molecular gas distribution , down to diffuse , low - luminosity envelopes .",
    "this is complemented by the @xmath1co line , which is optically thin up to h@xmath7 column densities of @xmath16 @xmath17 , and correlates well with denser material and star forming regions .    as well as the obvious interest that comes from investigating the molecular component of a known supershell",
    ", the present dataset also has several advantages that make it particularly attractive for this kind of large - scale cloud catalogue .",
    "firstly , the association of the molecular clouds with a single object means that their distances are both uniform and well - determined , reducing what would otherwise be a substantial source of uncertainty in the determined cloud properties .",
    "secondly , the majority of the complex is at high enough latitudes that line - of - sight confusion is minimal .",
    "this means that emission may be assigned to individual clouds without the need to resort to artificially high intensity thresholds , and leads to the inclusion of low - luminosity cloud envelopes that may be missed by other studies .",
    "in addition , the present dataset is both sensitive and relatively well resolved , with rms noise levels per 0.1 km s@xmath5 channel of @xmath18 k in @xmath0co(j=1 - 0 ) and @xmath19 k in @xmath1co(j=1 - 0 ) , and telescope half power beam widths of @xmath3 and @xmath20 respectively .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ observations ] describes the instrumentation and observing strategy .",
    "section [ cat ] presents the @xmath0co and @xmath1co cloud catalogue tables , and also describes the cloud decomposition method , the derivation of cloud properties and the completeness and coverage of the catalogue .",
    "section [ results ] examines some of the statistical properties of the cloud sample as a whole , and section [ discussion ] briefly discusses the vertical distribution of the molecular gas , as well as some of the issues surrounding mass estimation .",
    "we summarize in section [ summary ] .",
    "observations of the @xmath0co(j=1 - 0 ) and @xmath1co(j=1 - 0 ) transitions at 115.3 ghz and 110.2 ghz were made with the nanten 4 m telescope at las campanas observatory in chile .",
    "the 4 k cryogenically cooled sis mixer receiver provided a typical system noise temperature of @xmath21250 k at 115 ghz , and @xmath22 k at 110 ghz ( in a single side band ) , including the atmosphere towards the zenith @xcite .",
    "intensity calibration was made by the chopper wheel method .",
    "a 2048 channel acousto - optical spectrograph provided a total bandwidth of 40 mhz and an effective spectral resolution of 40 khz , corresponding to a velocity coverage and resolution of 100 km s@xmath5 and 0.1 km s@xmath5 , respectively .",
    "orion kl ( @xmath23 ) was observed as a standard calibrator source , with absolute antenna temperatures of @xmath24 k and 10 k assumed for the @xmath0co and @xmath1co lines .",
    "the telescope half power beam width was @xmath3 at 115 ghz and @xmath20 at 110 ghz .",
    "the data presented in this catalogue were taken in two observing runs covering the periods april to november 1998 and november 2001 to may 2002 .",

    "both datasets were also included by @xcite in their study of the atomic and molecular components of the supershell ism .",
    "details of the observing strategies , spatial coverage and data sensitivity are given in table [ obstable ] and figure [ obsregions ] .",
    "pointing centers for all regions were arranged in a square grid with separations of either @xmath25 or @xmath26 between adjacent pointings .",
    "region 1 was initially surveyed in @xmath0co(j=1 - 0 ) at a spacing of @xmath27 , and this preliminary data used as a guide for targeted @xmath25 observations .",
    "@xmath1co(j=1 - 0 ) pointings were then made at @xmath25 spacing towards clouds for which the peak @xmath0co(j=1 - 0 ) antenna temperature exceeded @xmath28 k ( region 3 ) .",
    "the remainder of region 1 was later covered in @xmath0co(j=1 - 0 ) at a spacing of @xmath26 , to attempt to pick up clouds missed by the initial @xmath27 pass .",
    "regions 2 and 4 were initially covered at @xmath26 spacing in both @xmath0co(j=1 - 0 ) and @xmath1co(j=1 - 0 ) , with targeted @xmath25 follow - up observations made towards the giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) g288.5 + 1.5 @xcite .",
    "the r.m.s noise per channel in @xmath29 is @xmath30 k at 115 ghz and @xmath31 k at 110 ghz ."
