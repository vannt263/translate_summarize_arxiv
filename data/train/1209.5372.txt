    "it follows from ( ii ) and from the axioms of root group data that the subgroup of @xmath2 generated by @xmath59 and @xmath84 is isomorphic to the wreath product @xmath85 , where the cyclic factor is generated by @xmath84 .",
    "since @xmath59 is not abelian , we deduce from proposition  [ prop : meskin ] that @xmath2 contains a non - residually finite subgroup , and can therefore not be residually finite . on the other hand @xmath2 is just - infinite by proposition  [ prop : nsp ] .",

    "it remains to show that @xmath87 .",
    "this follows from the fact that @xmath2 acts minimally ( in fact : edge - transitively ) on each half of its twin tree , and so does @xmath19 . but a group acting minimally on a tree can not split non - trivially as a direct product .",
    "hence @xmath87 and @xmath19 is a simple subgroup of finite index in @xmath2 .",

    "remark finally that there are only two conjugacy classes of root groups , the union of which generates the whole group @xmath2 .",
    "one of these conjugacy classes has trivial image under @xmath112 , since @xmath97 contains the root group @xmath88 .",
    "the other conjugacy class contains roots @xmath114 whose wall is far away from @xmath106 .",
    "this implies that @xmath115 , which has been proved to be abelian . we are done in this case .",
    "assume now that condition ( i@xmath94 ) holds .",
    "again , by proposition  [ prop : meskin ] , the commutator @xmath90 $ ] is contained in @xmath97 .",
    "if the rank one group @xmath116 is not a sharply @xmath0-transitive group , then it is a rank one simple group of lie type and we may conclude that it is entirely contained in @xmath97 .",
    "hence the same argument as in the case ( i@xmath92 ) with @xmath78 playing the role of @xmath101 yields the conclusion .",
    "if the rank one group @xmath116 is a sharply @xmath0-transitive group , then we dispose of the additional hypothesis that the commutator @xmath90 $ ] contains an involution .",
    "since @xmath117 is a sharply @xmath0-transitive , all its involutions are conjugate .",
    "they must thus all be contained in @xmath97 .",
    "in particular @xmath97 contains some involution @xmath118 swapping @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "again , this is enough to apply the same computation as above and conclude that for each root @xmath114 whose wall is far away from @xmath121 , the image of @xmath122 under @xmath112 is abelian and isomorphic to a quotient of @xmath113 .",
    "we take two distinct such roots @xmath123 so that there is no root @xmath101 strictly between @xmath114 and @xmath124 .",
    "thus @xmath113 and @xmath125 commute by the axioms of root group data .",
    "moreover @xmath2 is generated by @xmath126 , and we have just seen that , modulo @xmath97 , the root groups @xmath113 and @xmath127 ( resp . @xmath125 and @xmath128 ) become equal , and abelian .",
    "it follows that @xmath129 is isomorphic to a quotient of the direct product @xmath130 \\times u_\\beta/[u_\\beta , u_\\beta]$ ] .",
    "the desired result follows .",
    "finite sharply @xmath0-transitive groups are all known ; they correspond to finite near - fields , which were classified by zassenhaus .",
    "all of them are either dickson near - fields , or belong to a list of seven exceptional examples .",
    "an inspection of that list shows that , in all of these seven exceptions , the root group contains a copy of @xmath131 or @xmath132 ( see @xcite ) ; in particular the commutator subgroup of a root group is always of even order in those cases .",
    "thus condition ( i@xmath94 ) from lemma  [ lem : addendum ] only excludes certain sharply @xmath0-transitive groups associated with dickson near - fields .",
    "let @xmath2 be a kac  moody group over the finite field @xmath21 of order @xmath133 , associated with the generalized cartan matrix @xmath45 .",
    "the weyl group of @xmath2 is the infinite dihedral group and @xmath2 is a twin tree lattice ; the corresponding trees are both regular of degree @xmath134 .    when @xmath135 , the matrix @xmath44 is of * finite type * and @xmath2 is then a finite chevalley group over @xmath21 . when @xmath136 , the matrix @xmath44 is of * affine type * and @xmath2 is linear , and even @xmath43-arithmetic ; in particular it is residually finite .    in order to check that the conditions from theorem  [ thm - general ] are satisfied when @xmath23 and @xmath137 , we need a sharp control on the commutation relations satisfied by the root groups . the key technical result is the following lemma , which follows from the work of morita  @xcite and billig ",
    "pianzola  @xcite .",
    "assume that @xmath23 and @xmath137 .",
    "then for all @xmath145 , either @xmath119 and @xmath146 commute , or we have @xmath147 = u_{\\beta_i}.\\ ] ] similarly , for all @xmath148 , either @xmath119 and @xmath146 commute , or we have @xmath149 = u_{-\\beta_i}.\\ ] ]      lemma  [ lem : commrel ] readily implies that conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) from theorem  [ thm - general ] are satisfied ( we can take @xmath150 in this case ) , so that @xmath2 is virtually simple .",
    "in fact , lemma  [ lem : commrel ] shows that some root group is equal to the commutator of a pair of prenilpotent root groups , so that condition ( i@xmath92 ) from lemma  [ lem : addendum ] is satisfied .",
    "the latter ensures that @xmath19 is the commutator subgroup of @xmath2 , and that the quotient @xmath20 is bounded above by the maximal order of a root group .",
    "thus the theorem holds , since all the root groups have order @xmath133 in this case ."
