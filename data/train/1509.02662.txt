    "due to the large coupling coefficients , the resistivities induced by the homopolar and frhlich interactions have largest values .",
    "it is well known that the resistivity exhibits mpr when the energy of optical phonons @xmath294 equals the distance of landau levels . in monolayer mos@xmath0 for @xmath295 ,",

    "it is true that the magnetoresistances show peaks or valleys at @xmath298 , i.e. magnetoresistance oscillates with inverse magnetic field having period @xmath299 .",
    "however , in contrast to the usual mpr induced by optical phonons in two - dimensional electron gas , the oscillating resistivity in mos@xmath0 is modulated due to the spin splitting by an approximate factor @xmath300 analogous to the sdho .",

    "the magnetoresistance increases monotonously with magnetic field , and only a small oscillation occurs at very large field . in fig.[mprsop](d ) , contributions of three important optical modes are plotted .",
    "the effect of a sio@xmath0 substrate on the mpr of mos@xmath0 is also tested and it is found that this dielectric plays negligible role due to its large frequencies of sops .",
    "in summary , we have studied the linear magnetotransport in single layer mos@xmath0 employing a balance equation analysis by including spin - orbit coupling and all kinds of intravalley and intervalley electron - impurity and electron - phonon scatterings .",
    "the existence of an energy gap between the conduction and valence bands , or lack of electron - hole symmetry of the zero landau level in mos@xmath0 , makes its magnetotransport behavior more like a conventional 2d electron gas than graphene : the resistivity peaks or valleys of its low - temperature sdho , resulting either from intravalley or from intervally elastic scatterings , locate at integers of filling factor @xmath194 .",
    "the large spin - orbit coupling in the system , however , gives rise to a significant modulation or beating of the magnetoresistance oscillation , or a phase inversion of the oscillation peaks .",
    "the agreement between theoretical prediction and recent experiment on the phase inversion of sdho peaks demonstrates the importance of the spin - orbit splitting in magnetotransport even for systems of low - mobility . the clear beating pattern of the oscillating magnetoresistance should appear in the well - separated landau - level regime in high - mobility systems .",
    "on the other hand , the behavior of magnetoresistance oscillation at large magnetic fields or small filling factors appears different for intravalley and intervalley scatterings : the period of oscillation associated with intravalley scattering may halve due to the weak decay of the second - order oscillating term , while in the case of intervalley disorder much stronger spin - orbit induced sdho modulation shows up that there exists a magnetic - field range in which the magnetoresistivity almost vanishes .",
    "of course , intervalley elastic scattering contributes only a much smaller part to the total magnetoresistance than that from intravalley ones .    at high temperatures ,",
    "the magnetoresistance oscillation arising from mpr may show up in the smooth impurity - induced resistivity background both for suspended and nonsuspended samples with high mobility .",
    "both acoustic phonons ( mainly intravalley transverse and longitudinal acoustic modes ) and optic phonons ( mainly homopolar and frhlich modes ) can induce mpr .",
    "a beating pattern with the same frequency as in the sdho also appears in the optical - phonon - induced mpr due to spin - orbit coupling . for the single layer on a substrate , another resonance due to",
