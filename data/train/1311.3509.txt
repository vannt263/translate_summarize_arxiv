    "in the standard cosmological framework in which the universe is described on large scales by a smooth friedmann - lematre space - time , the spatial sections can enjoy a locally euclidean , spherical or hyperbolic geometry  @xcite .",
    "whatever the spatial geometry , it is always possible to assume different topologies for space , _ i.e. _ different boundary conditions , a property that remains undetermined by the einstein field equations .",
    "the study of spatial topology and the possibility to constrain it observationally has attracted a large activity in the past decades ; see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews .    from an observational point of view",
    ", constraining the shape and size of our universe requires to use data spanning the largest possible scales compared to the hubble volume .",
    "initial works focused mostly on large scale structures  @xcite but these techniques were limited by many effects , such as the completeness of the catalogues , evolution effects , _ etc . _ and limited in the range of scales that can be probed . the cosmic microwave background ( cmb )",
    "anisotropies seem to be the most promising observational tool for that purpose , mostly because they probe the largest cosmological scales we can currently access , have comparatively limited systematic errors and , from a theoretical point of view , only require the use of linear perturbation theory , which allow one to implement topology very efficiently  @xcite .",
    "when decomposed in spherical harmonics , the mutipoles @xmath0 of cmb temperature anisotropies are random complex fields characterised by their correlation matrix @xmath1    spatial topology imprints mostly three types of signatures on the cmb  @xcite :    * _ angular power spectrum_. this is the central quantity used to infer the standard cosmological constraints , mostly because as long as local isotropy ( and thus statistical isotropy ) holds then the correlation matrix reduces to @xmath2 so that the angular power spectrum @xmath3 contains the whole information of the temperature fluctuations if they are distributed according to gaussian statistics .",
    "since the @xmath3 is obtained by averaging the correlation matrix , it loses much of the topological information . for many years however , most constraints on the topology relied on its behaviour .",
    "it was used in the early analysis with cobe data , mostly to constrain the size of a torus universe  @xcite .",
    "one has however to note that ( 1 ) the topological signature appears on large angular scale , where the cosmic variance is the largest and ( 2 ) it depends on assumptions on the initial power spectrum .",
    "it is usually assumed that the initial power spectrum is almost scale invariant ( as predicted by standard inflation , which at the same time predicts that the universe shall be locally euclidean and much larger than the observable universe ) .",
    "topology however sets a new cosmological characteristic scale and there is a priori no reason that the scale invariance of the power spectrum holds  @xcite . nonetheless , the low quadrupole observed by cobe and wmap was one of the driving motivation for topology , in particular of the poincar space  @xcite , and more generally to argue for a `` well - proportioned '' universe  @xcite .",
    "the angular power spectrum is thus a good indicator but will not be decisive in proving the existence or absence of any topological structure .",

    "the cmb has been emitted at the time of last scattering so that all observed cmb photons arise from a 2-sphere centered on us . in a non - trivial topology",
    ", the last scattering surface can warp around and self - intersect on circles , which means , from an observer s point of view , that there exist pairs of circles sharing the same temperature anisotropy pattern along them .",
    "this point is at the heart of the `` circles in the sky method ''  @xcite that allows one , in principle , to detect and reconstruct  @xcite space topology if it appears on scales smaller than the last - scattering diameter .",

    "* _ correlation function violation of global isotropy_. as long as isotropy holds , the correlation matrix is diagonal , in the sense that @xmath4 .",
    "a non - trivial topological structure implies that global isotropy is broken , which should be imprinted on deviations of the correlation matrix from a diagonal matrix ; see _ e.g. _ refs .",
    "@xcite for early considerations .",
    "this property was used to constrain the torus topology  @xcite .",
    "the knowledge of the shape of the correlation matrix allows one to design adapted estimators and can be tested by different techniques  @xcite .    in conclusion ,",
    "the angular power spectrum is a poor indicator , the circle method is independent of assumptions on local physics but restricted to scales smaller than the diameter of the last scattering surface , @xmath5 .",
    "the information contained in the correlation matrix can be used to probe topology on larger scales , at the expense of being restricted to a class of topologies .    at the time being , cosmological observations indicate that space is almost euclidean , which sets constraints on topologies that are potentially detectable  @xcite .",
    "the circles in the sky method was used with wmap data , mostly to set the constrain that the length of the shortest closed space - like geodesic that self - intersects at our location in the universe to 98.5% of @xmath5 , _",
    "i.e. _ about 26  gpc  @xcite .",

    "planck _ mission ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the _ planck _ analysis on topology ) .",
    "note also that all existing observations of the cmb in cobe , wmap and _ planck _ data have drawn special attention to several possible anomalies and statistical deviations from the standard model , such as north - south asymmetries , cold spot , axis of evil  @xcite , point toward a possible violation of statistical isotropy and are the reasons underlying for the search for a new cosmological model .    from a theoretical point of view",
    ", the theory of cmb anisotropies in a non - trivial topology seems under control .",
    "it relies heavily on the linearity of the perturbation equations and of the temperature - perturbation relation arising from the boltzmann equation at linear order . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , one can work in fourier space so that the key ingredient to implement topology is the spectrum of the laplacian .",
    "we will follow this technique that is summarized in section  [ section2 ] .    in this article , we want to investigate the power of the correlation matrix method by restricting our analysis to a class of models in order to determine the minimal size of a non - trivial topology that makes cmb predictions undistinguishable from those of a universe with trivial topology .",
    "that question will be addressed by using the kullback - leibler divergence and described in section  [ section3 ] .",
    "section  [ section4 ] focuses on the family of torus universes in order to discuss their detectability , especially in the context of experimental issues such as masking and noise .",
    "then section  [ section5 ] takes into account cmb polarization .",
    "to finish , we explore in appendix  [ section6 ] the signature of spatial topology on higher statistics and on non - gaussianity .",
    "this work will show that the topology of a flat torus can in principle be detected on scales larger that the last scattering surface even if one takes into account mask effects and noises .    in this work ,",
    "the python package healpy based on healpix  @xcite was used for all cmb simulations .",
    "the topology of three - dimensional spaces of constant curvature has been extensively described and we refer to the reviews  @xcite for an introduction . for the sake of clarity , we just define the main structures required for our purpose .    in standard relativistic cosmology ,",
    "the universe is described by a friedmann - lematre spacetime with locally isotropic and homogeneous spatial sections . in the case of a multiply connected universe ,",
    "we visualize space as the quotient @xmath6 of a simply connected space @xmath7 ( which is just a 3-sphere @xmath8 , a euclidean space @xmath9 , or a hyperbolic space @xmath10 , depending on the curvature ) , @xmath11 being a discrete and fixed point free symmetry group of @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath11 is not fixed point free , there is a curvature singularity and general relativity can no longer be applied .",
    "for example string theory can be used with non - classical topologies with fixed point , as in refs .",
    "this group @xmath11 is called the holonomy group and its existence changes the boundary conditions on all the functions defined on the spatial sections , which subsequently need to be @xmath11-periodic .",
    "hence , the topology leaves the local physics unchanged while modifying the boundary conditions on all the fields . given a field @xmath12 living on @xmath7",
    ", one can construct a field @xmath13 leaving on @xmath6 by projection as @xmath14 since then , for all @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",

    "the classification of the topologies of three dimensional spaces of constant curvature depends on the geometry of the universal covering space . in this article",
    ", we focus on the euclidean space @xmath9 , for which there exists 18 different topologies that can be split into 10 compact spaces ( 6 orientable and 4 non - orientable ) , 5 chimney spaces having only two compact directions ( 2 orientable and 3 non - orientable ) , 2 slab spaces having one compact direction ( 1 orientable and 1 non - orientable ) and the euclidean space .",
    "their holonomy group is a finite subgroup of the isometry of the euclidean space @xmath24 .",
    "their structure and fundamental polyhedron are given explicitly in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the standard cosmological framework",
    ", the properties of large scale structures can be understood using perturbation theory . at linear order",
    ", the perturbation equations reduce to partial differential equations involving time derivatives up to second order and spatial derivatives , that appear only through a laplacian because of the local spatial homogeneity of the background space - time .",
    "it is thus convenient to solve these equations in fourier space where they become ordinary differential equations .",
    "the strategy to implement topology is then in principle simple ( we refer to refs .",
    "@xcite for early developments of this approach ) .",
    "first we shall solve the cosmological perturbation equations as in the standard framework but only for the eigenmodes of the laplacian that are compatible with the boundary conditions imposed by the topology .",
    "one technical step is thus the determination of the eigenfunctions and we shall determine them by developing on the basis of the natural eigenfunctions of the laplacian of the universal covering space .",
    "then , the cmb predictions can be inferred from the linearity of the sachs - wolfe formula .",

    "applied to the family of cubic tori , we have concluded that its size needs to be larger than 1.15 times the diameter of the last scattering surface in order for the finite space to be indistinguishable in practice from an infinite universe .",
    "the effect of the noise was considered and shown to be negligible for experiments such as wmap and _ planck _ and we have also shown that for the conclusion is not affected by reasonable galactic cut .",
    "we also applied this analysis to polarization simulation and discovered that when considering only polarization data , we have a smaller limit size of @xmath288 for ideal experimental conditions .",
    "however we learned the polarization is more effective to distinguish small 3-tori .",
    "as a consequence , when both temperature and polarization data are taken into account , it improves the detectability only at @xmath303 .",
    "to finish , we have investigated the signature of a non - trivial topology on the 3-point function , focusing on the equilateral bispectrum for simplicity .    _",
    "planck _ results on topology in  @xcite show no detection of a non - trivial topology .",
    "on the one hand the _ planck _ collaboration find no evidence for the existence of back - to - back circles of correlation .",
    "the lower bound of any spatial dimension @xmath110 of the fundamental domain of our universe evaluated with this particular method is bigger than @xmath304 with a confidence level of @xmath305 . on the other hand the bayesian analysis of the data",
    "show no strong evidence of a multi - connected universe , even if there is a faint detection of a torus bigger than the diameter of the last scattering surface .",
    "the future release of _ planck _ polarization data will allow us to improve considerably the constraints on models whose size @xmath110 is smaller than @xmath223 as explained in this paper .",
    "however , there is very few hope for an improvement of the constraints for models bigger than @xmath223 as seen earlier .",

    "the effect of the topology is to kill some wave - numbers and thus project the allowed perturbations in fourier space to a subspace compatible with the boundary conditions imposed by the topology . as we have discussed in   [ section2 ] ,",
    "the relation between the eigenmodes is linear so that this does not affect the statistical properties of the @xmath0 . nevertheless , and as seen on fig .",
    "[ fig1b ] , the topology has an imprint on the spectra .        for a gaussian temperature , @xmath315 .",
    "deviations from gaussianity are expected to be due to the non - linear evolution of the perturbation  @xcite or primordial non - gaussianity generated during inflation  @xcite .    from the 2-point correlation matrix",
    ", one can construct the angular power spectrum .",
    "because of the violation of global isotropy , the 3-point function must be described by the 6-dimensional quantity @xmath316 . as a first insight we however concentrate on the angular averaged bispectrum @xmath317 , which is the analog of the angular power spectrum @xmath3 and",
    "is defined as @xmath318 where @xmath319 are the wigner @xmath307-symbols .",
    "we described non - gaussianity by decomposing the @xmath0 as the sum of a gaussian contribution @xmath320 and of a non - gaussian one @xmath321 as @xmath322 in the standard description  @xcite with euclidean trivial spatial topology , the @xmath0 are given by @xmath323 which has to be compared to eq .",

    "let us now consider the case of a 3-torus . from the general expression  ( [ p44t2 ] ) and the particular expression of the coefficients @xmath333 given by eq .",
    "( [ xi - torus ] ) for a 3-torus , we have that the previous expressions now take the form @xmath334 and @xmath335 keeping in mind that the sum is taken on the wave - numbers defined by eq .",

    "each sum over @xmath349 with @xmath350 can be expressed in terms of legendre polynomials using eq .",

    "the previous expressions can be further simplified since the kernel @xmath358 can be computed analytically .",

    "then , introducing @xmath375 the angle between @xmath376 and @xmath377 , we have the relations @xmath378 from which we deduce that @xmath379 which can also be rewritten as @xmath380 it follows that @xmath381 can be expressed only as a function of @xmath361 after integration on @xmath371 and @xmath375 as    @xmath382}{2}\\right )        p_\\ell\\left(\\frac{\\sin\\theta\\left[\\cos\\alpha+\\sin\\alpha\\right]}{2}\\right )        p_\\ell\\left(\\sin\\theta\\frac{(1+k)\\cos\\alpha+(1-k)\\sin\\alpha}{\\sqrt{1 + 2\\mu_{12}k + k^2 } } \\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    given that the legendre polynomials are of order @xmath34 , this is an integration of a product of sine and cosine .",
