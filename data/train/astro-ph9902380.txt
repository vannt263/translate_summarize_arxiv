    "in a recent paper , novello and colaborators @xcite have analysed the cosmological consequences of quantum corrections to maxwell electrodynamics .",
    "they have considered the quantum effects leading to the production of electron - positron pairs that were first derived by heisenberg and euler @xcite .",
    "the analysis was a semiclassical one ( quantum field in a classical general relativistic geometry ) , made in first order on the effective lagrangean density ( weak field limit ) and applied to a spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) model .",
    "the more interesting result found in ref .",
    "@xcite was the removal of the primordial singularity due to the appearance of a negative pressure in the early stages of the universe .",
    "the analytical solution derived shows that the energy density associated with the electromagnetic field vanishes at the point where the scale factor reaches its minimum .",
    "the non - singular behaviour of the model is unaffected by the presence of other types of ultrarelativistic matter obeying the equation of state @xmath5 . in a subsequent paper @xcite",
    ", the analysis was extended beyond the first order approximation and the numerical solutions obtained show that the non - singular behaviour is preserved .    the conclusion reached by the authors of references",
    "@xcite was that the cosmological singularity of frw models is a distinguished feature of classical electrodynamics .",
    "this problem is overcome when quantum corrections are taken into account , leading to a more realistic description of the universe .    in the present paper",
    "we extend the analysis developed in @xcite .",
    "we begin by showing that the analytical solution obtained in that paper is a particular one and write down the corresponding general solution .",
    "we then analyse how this solution is modified by the presence of a non - zero cosmological term @xmath0 in two different situations : we consider both the case of a constant @xmath0 , which leads also to a non - singular universe , and the case of a time varying `` cosmological constant '' that supplies energy to a constant cosmological magnetic field .",
    "the equation that leads to a constant magnetic field as a possible solution to the field equations appeared already in ref .",
    "@xcite but was disregarded .",
    "the presence of a time varying @xmath0 gives physical meaning to such a solution .",
    "the time dependence for @xmath0 is univocally determined and represents a slightly modification of a form that has been suggested frequently in the literature ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 constant @xcite ) .",
    "the universe described by this latter solution begins arbitrarily small in the far past , expands towards a maximum size @xmath8 at the point where the vacuum energy reaches its minimum and then contracts towards an arbitrarily small size in the distant future .",
    "a remarkable feature of this model is that it has an inflationary dynamics , except during a short period of time near @xmath8 .",
    "this scenario obviously violate the standard evolution law for the magnetic field ( @xmath9 ) , which is commonly used to rescale to present time the several constraints on primordial magnetic fields presented in the literature @xcite .",
    "we also discuss the restrictions on the domain of validity of the solutions found , due to the use of the first order approximation for the effective electromagnetic lagrangean .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ s2 ] we set down the basic equations . in section [ s3 ]",
    "we generalize the solution derived in @xcite which assumes a vanishing cosmological term and a time - dependent magnetic field .. in section [ s4 ] we obtain a new solution that takes into account the presence of a constant @xmath0 . a new solution involving the presence of a @xmath10 plus a constant magnetic field",

    "the magnetic field @xmath12 @xcite is measured in tesla @xcite and the fine structure constant is given by @xcite @xmath13 so that the magnitude of the electron charge is @xmath14 ( see the appendix a of ref . @xcite and the appendix on units and dimensions of ref .",

    "in the system of units used in this paper , the lagrangean density for free fields in classical maxwell electrodynamics is written as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the electromagnetic field strength tensor .",
    "canonical energy - momentum tensor is then given by @xmath17    the quantum corrections to classical electrodynamics that should be considered in order to describe the process of creation of electron - positron pairs by the electromagnetic field were evaluated by heisenberg and euler @xcite . a clear derivation of the effective lagrangean that describes these quantum effects can be found in @xcite , where one should be aware that the gaussian system of electromagnetic units is used .",

    "recent observations that have led to the so called age problem [ 13  15 ] have driven attention to cosmological models with a non - vanishing @xmath0 .",
    "estimates of the density parameter and some kinematical tests also point to the existence of an effective vacuum component @xcite .",
    "even more recently , some evidence for an accelerated cosmic expansion has arised from measurements involving type 1a supernova at high redshifts @xcite . on the other hand , quantum field theory and inflationary cosmologies have pointed out to the possibility of treating @xmath0 is a dynamical quantity [ 4,16,20  22 ] several mechanisms have been identified as possible sources of fluctuating vacuum energy ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) .    as it will be shown below",
    ", the field equations lead to a possible solution corresponding to a constant magnetic field plus a time - dependent cosmological term . in this case",
    "the time dependence of @xmath0 is univocally determined .    replacing ( [ e23 ] ) and ( [ e24 ] ) in the einstein equations ( [ e28 ] ) - ( [ e29 ] ) and in the energy conservation equation ( [ e30 ] )",

    "this is the case studied in @xcite where a particular solution for the scale factor was found .",
    "we will find the corresponding general solution and indicate how to recover this previous result .",

    "> from ( [ e38 ] ) we see that , for large @xmath50 , we recover the usual solution for radiation dominated universes , @xmath76 . however , the more interesting feature of ( [ e38 ] ) is that the quadratic function inside the parenthesis does not have real roots , being positive for any @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , the model is non - singular with @xmath59 reaching the minimum value @xmath77 at @xmath78    the universe thus obtained is a bouncing one : it begins arbitrarily large at @xmath79 , decreases until the minimum value ( [ e45 ] ) at @xmath80 and then begins to expand .",
    "a crucial feature of the above results is that the magnetic field at @xmath80 is @xmath81 a value much greater than the minimal critical value given by eq .",
    "( [ e10 ] ) which limits the domain of validity of the first order correction given by ( [ e5 ] ) .",
    "we are forced to conclude that the above solution does not apply all the way back to the point of minimum size of the universe .",
    "this point has not been acknowledged explicitly by the authors of reference @xcite , although their numerical calculations @xcite based on the exact effective lagrangean density ( beyond the first order approximation ) seems to confirm the non - singular behaviour of the model .",
    "we should remark that , in @xcite , the requirement ( [ e8 ] ) is mentioned , but not the condition ( [ e10 ] ) , which is established only in equation ( 6.84 ) of @xcite . note also that @xmath82    the times for which the constraint ( [ e10 ] ) is obeyed may be easily determined using ( [ e42 ] ) .",
    "we find that the solution ( [ e38 ] ) fulfill the above requirement for @xmath83 where @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the planck mass .",
    "this seems to be a disappointing conclusion about the capability of the first order quantum correction ( [ e5 ] ) to describe the very early stages of the universe . in the next two sections we try to evade this problem by allowing for the existence of a non - vanishing cosmological term , as it has been increasingly indicated by recent theoretical and observational results @xcite .",
    "one could speculate that models with a time varying fine structure `` constant '' could perhaps evade the above mentioned problem .",
    "in fact , if @xmath86 , and consequently @xmath87 , was grater at early times , the value of @xmath88 could reach values below the constraint ( [ e10 ] ) .",
    "however , in spite of the fact that models with oscillatory variation of the fundamental constants have been proposed @xcite , recent calculations using the keck telescope data seems to indicate a negative variation of @xmath86 at high redshift ( @xmath89 ) : @xmath90 @xcite .    before going to this next step ,",
    "let us mention that , if ( [ e38 ] ) could describe the entire evolution of the universe in the distant past , it would imply the existence of an inflationary era ( @xmath91 ) in the interval @xmath92 where @xmath93    figure 1 shows the scale factor , the magnetic field , the energy density and the pressure as a function of time for a definite value of @xmath56 .",
    "the time interval where the weak field approximation breaks down is also indicated .",

    "thereafter , the contraction phase takes place .",
    "the vacuum energy then grows , becoming positive at @xmath157 whereas @xmath38 remains constant .",
    "the expected tendency of @xmath38 growing adiabatically with the decreasing @xmath158 is compensated by the increase in @xmath159 .",

    "if one expects any such model to properly describe the evolution of the real universe , it would be advisable to take into account other matter fields , such as ultrarelativistic matter , scalar fields or dust .",
    "in @xcite , it was demonstrated , for the case @xmath164 , @xmath165 , that the presence of ultrarelativistic matter with an equation of state @xmath166 would just amount for a reparametrization of the constants @xmath56 and @xmath87 .",

    "we have found a new solution when @xmath0 is a non - vanishing constant . in both cases ,",
    "the universe is non - singular , bouncing at a critical time when it reaches its minimum size .",
    "however , we have shown that , near this critical time , the magnetic field increases beyond the value allowed by the use of the first order approximation to the effetcive lagrangean density . the time range where this weak field approximation does apply was evaluated . on the other hand , numerical work , that takes into account higher order terms ,",
    "indicates that the non - singular behaviour is preserved @xcite .",
    "we have derived a third solution that describes a universe driven by a time dependent @xmath0 that sustains a constant magnetic field . in this case",
    ", the time behaviour of the cosmological term is univocally determined and depends on the logarithym of the scale factor . for small enough values of the magnetic field strength",

    "it therefore decays during the expansion phase and increases during the contraction era , so as to keep the magnetic energy constant .",
    "the dynamics is inflationary during most of the cosmic history , except near @xmath138 .",
    "we are presently attempting to generalize our results for universes with non - zero curvature as well as analysing how our models would be modified by the presence of other matter fields .",
    "another possibility is to study how the time evolution for the magnetic field , to be derived from ( [ e33 ] ) , would be modified by imposing a definite decaying law for @xmath0 .",
    "this could be chosen among the several forms presented in the literature ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
