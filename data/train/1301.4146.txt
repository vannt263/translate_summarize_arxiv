    "non - equilibrium steady states for open mechanical particle systems have been extensively studied in recent years as a part of the efforts to derive the fourier law from the laws of microscopic dynamics @xcite .",
    "the existence of non - equilibrium steady states has been rigorously shown for only a handful of systems , mostly by using either spectral - theoretic arguments @xcite or harris ergodic theorem @xcite ; these methods automatically yield exponential mixing and exponential rates of convergence of initial distributions to the unique steady state . for systems that do not mix exponentially fast , which is frequently the case for continuous - time mechanical particle systems driven by heat reservoirs , general methods to prove the existence of non - equilibrium steady states are virtually nonexistent . in some special cases ,",
    "one may show tightness using direct estimates on the return times to the heat reservoirs @xcite , and , provided that the heat reservoirs randomize velocities fully , show the existence of the steady states .",
    "a great exposition of ideas and difficulties associated with this task is presented in @xcite .",
    "this paper , together with @xcite , provides a rigorous proof of the existence of a unique steady state with sub - exponential mixing rates for a class of random billiards driven by thermostats which randomize the velocities only in one direction , leaving a large memory trace in the system .",
    "in addition , for a large class of initial distributions , we obtain polynomial lower bounds on the rates of convergence of to the steady state .    in the system we consider , the particles move freely between collisions with non - intersecting disk - shaped random scatterers arranged on a torus so that no particle can move indefinitely without colliding with a scatterer . upon a collision of a particle with a scatterer ,",
    "an energy exchange occurs , in which the tangential component of the particle s velocity is randomized according to a gaussian distribution with variance proportional to the temperature assigned to the random scatterer , and the normal component of the velocity changes sign .",
    "the disk - shaped random scatterers act as thermostats in the following sense : assume we set all the random scatterers at temperature @xmath0 and start with an ensemble of @xmath1 particles at temperature @xmath2 , i.e. , the probability that a given particle has kinetic energy within @xmath3 near @xmath4 is approximately @xmath5 , which corresponds to the gibbs distribution at temperature @xmath6 .",
    "we show , inter alia , that the distribution of the particle kinetic energies converges to the gibbs distribution at temperature @xmath0 .",
    "heat conduction in this system may be studied by assigning one thermostat a temperature @xmath7 different from @xmath0 assigned to all others .",
    "further understanding of the properties of the non - equilibrium steady states is required for this task ; we leave heat conduction studies of this system for future work .",
    "the particles in this system do not interact , so the analysis can be simplified by considering a system with only one particle .",
    "in this situation , it is convenient to study the discrete dynamics of particle collisions with the boundaries of the thermostats . upon collisions with thermostats , the normal component of the particle s velocity represents the memory kept in the system , while the tangential component gets fully randomized .",
    "therefore , one can define a discrete markov chain in position and normal velocity variables that represents the original dynamics at collisions . for this markov chain , the existence and uniqueness of the invariant probability measure , which describes the steady state , along with exponential rates of convergence of the initial distributions to the invariant measure",

    ". however , one of the key observations in our proof is that the potential ( lyapunov ) function and the minorization condition required for application of harris ergodic theorem in the discrete case can be used to obtain upper and lower bounds on certain integrals and the measures of certain sets .    before proceeding with the actual proof we briefly review the results in @xcite in [ subsect : review ] . in [ subsect : finiteness ] we prove the existence of a unique invariant probability measure ( the steady state ) by constructing a suspension flow over the discrete dynamics and showing that the average of the roof function is finite . the mixing and convergence of initial distributions to the invariant measure",
