    "a laboratory - generated dusty plasma is a suspension of micron - sized particles immersed in a usual plasma with ions , electrons and neutral gas molecules @xcite .",
    "dust particles acquire a few thousand of electron charges by absorbing the surrounding electrons and ions , and they consequently interact with each other via a dynamically - screened coulomb potential @xcite , while undergoing brownian motions due to frequent collisions , mainly with the neutral gas molecules .",
    "when the interaction potential energy between charged dust particles significantly exceeds their kinetic energy , they become strongly coupled and , consequently , they can form ordered structures characteristic of a liquid or solid state .",
    "such structures are commonly referred to as strongly coupled dusty plasmas ( scdps ) .    two - dimensional ( 2d )",
    "scdps have become particularly favored in recent laboratory experiments , because in 2d geometry the complication due to ion wake effect ( see , e. g. , @xcite and references therein ) should be absent and the particle interaction can be well approximated by the yukawa potential @xcite .",
    "of particular interest in 2d dusty plasmas are their collective and dynamical properties , such as longitudinal and transverse wave modes , which have been studied extensively over the past decade in experiments @xcite , theories @xcite , and numerical simulations @xcite . on the experimental side , externally excited ( longitudinal ) dust lattice waves ( dlws ) were first observed by homann _",

    "next , thermally excited phonon spectrum in a 2d plasma crystal was observed in an experiment by nunomura _",
    "@xcite , who demonstrated a good agreement of this spectrum with theory @xcite for both the longitudinal and transverse modes in the entire first brillouin zone .",
    "that experiment was later extended by zhdanov _",
    "@xcite , who studied the polarization of wave modes in a 2d plasma crystal , and by nunomura _",
    "@xcite , who studied the wave spectra in both liquid and solid states for a wide range of wavelengths .",

    "@xcite , as well as the standard dust acoustic wave ( daw ) theory @xcite along with its 2d derivatives @xcite , there have been many other studies of scdps . for example , a semi - analytic approximation was used to study wave propagation in 2d scdps @xcite .",

    "the latter method was used , in particular , to study critical wavenumbers for transverse modes in a 3d dusty plasma in liquid phase @xcite . on the other hand , computer simulations @xcite , as an essential supplement to real experiments , have played important roles in validating various analytical theories and in explaining experimental observations . both molecular dynamics ( md ) and the particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations",

    "@xcite to study longitudinal wave dispersion in one - dimensional systems .",
    "results were compared with the daw mode and with the 3d qlca @xcite including the strong - coupling effects , and an agreement with the qlca was found only at very long wavelengths due to the small system size .",
    "later on , ohta and hamaguchi @xcite studied both longitudinal and transverse dispersion relations in 3d dusty plasma liquids , and results were compared with both the qlca @xcite and the gh model @xcite .",
    "it was found that , for the longitudinal mode , both theories were in close agreement with simulations in the entire first brillouin zone , whereas , for the transverse mode , good agreements with simulations were found for both theories , except in the very long wavelength region , where the gh model successfully predicts a cutoff but the qlca does not .",
    "this deficiency of the qlca can be rectified by introducing a phenomenological damping which accounts for the diffusional and other damping effects , as was shown more recently in the work by kalman _",

    "secondly , no simulations have been conducted to show a transition from the random phase approximation ( rpa ) based daw to the harmonic approximation ( ha ) based dlw when dusty plasma goes from a high temperature liquid ( or non - ideal gaseous ) state to a low temperature crystalline state .",
    "third , an analytical theory based on the rpa @xcite predicted a so - called dust thermal wave ( dtw ) due to the direct thermal effect of dust , and its existence was verified in a subsequent experiment @xcite .",

    "is also investigated in the simulation .",

    "our simulation is based on the brownian dynamics ( bd ) method @xcite , which may be regarded as a generalization of the standard md method .",
    "namely , while the md simulation is based on newton s equations of motion , the bd method is based on their generalization in the form of langevin equation ( and its integral ) , viz . , @xmath0 where , as usual , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are , respectively , the mass , velocity and position of a brownian particle , and @xmath4 is the systematic ( deterministic ) force coming from the inter - particle interactions within the system and , possibly , from external force fields .",
    "what is different from newton s equations is the appearance of dynamic friction , @xmath5 , and the brownian acceleration , @xmath6 , which represent complementing effects of a single , sub - scale phenomenon : numerous , frequent collisions of brownian particle with molecules in the medium .",
    "while the former represents the average effect of these collisions , the latter represents fluctuations due to discreteness of the collisions , and is generally assumed to be well represented by a delta - correlated gaussian white noise .",
    "they are both related to the medium temperature through a fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",

    "( [ eqlangevin ] ) may be numerically integrated in a manner similar to the integration of newton s equations in the md method , and such a technique is generally called brownian dynamics .",
    "( note that several different names are used in literature to designate methods for numerical integration of langevin equation , for example , brownian dynamics , langevin dynamics , or langevin molecular dynamics , depending on the background , area , or preferences of different researchers .",
    "those names may refer to the same technique that we discuss here , or they may involve subtle differences in derivations of the simulation formulae , and/or in implementations of simulation .",
    "we follow here definitions given by allen and tildesley @xcite . )",
    "the advantages of bd here are as follows .",
    "firstly it brings the simulation closer to real dusty plasma experiments by taking into account both the brownian motion and damping effect self - consistently .",
    "and secondly it simplifies the simulation in a sense that no external thermostat is need .",
    "we employ here the 5th order gear - like predictor - corrector algorithm @xcite for bd simulation , which was used successfully in simulating shock wave propagation @xcite , heat conduction @xcite , and diffusion processes in scdps @xcite . when compared with several other popular methods for bd simulation , such as euler - like , beeman - like and verlet - like methods @xcite",
    ", the present method can cover a wider range of friction coefficients @xmath7 , and is particularly reliable in the low - damping regime while exhibiting higher - order accuracy , good stability , and negligible drift on long time scales .",
    "therefore , the present algorithm appears to be especially suitable to simulate dusty plasmas , which are often slightly damped .       for @xmath8 and different @xmath9.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    typically , @xmath10 dust particles are simulated in a square with periodic boundary conditions .",

    "note here that the yukawa interaction is not merely an assumption , but is rather consistent with theoretical derivations , described in the following section .",
    "such a system can be fully characterized by three parameters @xcite : the coulomb coupling parameter , @xmath16 , the screening parameter , @xmath17 , and the damping rate , @xmath18 , due to the neutral gas , where @xmath19 is the system temperature ( in energy units ) , @xmath20 the wigner - seitz radius , and @xmath21 the equilibrium dust number density .",

    "for the ha @xcite , results are quite similar to those of qlca .",
    "there are two branches given by , @xmath139 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\pm & \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{[m_{xx}+m_{yy}]^2 + 4(m^{2}_{xy}-m_{xx}m_{yy } ) } , \\label{eq_wk_ha}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath140 is given by eq .",

    "( [ eq_wk_ha ] ) , respectively .",
    "therefore , wave propagation depends on the angle @xmath141 , and its dispersion relations are functions with the period of @xmath130 due to the hexagonal symmetry @xcite .",
    "the angular dependence arises because the system is now anisotropic at short wavelengths .",
    "figure [ fig_lt_ha ] shows wave spectra of both longitudinal and transverse modes in a crystalline state with @xmath129 .",
    "also shown are the dispersion relations of the ha , eqlca and daw .",
    "the ha curves cover the whole period of @xmath130 with an increment of @xmath131 degrees .",
    "it is seen that the simulation agrees very well with the ha , and that the polarization effects in the simulation spectra are fully captured by the ha .",
    "good agreement between the eqlca and the simulation is retained in the first brillouin zone . for large wave - numbers",
    ", the eqlca can not resolve the polarization , i.e. , the angular - dependence of the dispersion .",
    "nevertheless , it captures the correct tendency for oscillations .",
    "moreover , at this range of @xmath9 values , the qlca regains its credibility because both the thermal effect and the long wavelength cutoff corrections become unimportant , and the eqlca essentially reduces to the standard qlca . at the same time",
    ", it is remarkable to see that the mean field daw is so robust , even in a crystalline state , where it still offers a fairly good agreement with the simulation at long wavelengths .    , @xmath94 but different damping rate @xmath7.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]       of both longitudinal and transverse wave spectra for @xmath8 , @xmath94 but different neutral gas damping rate @xmath7.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    we finally investigate the effects of damping on wave spectra . generally speaking , there are two types of damping mechanisms for collective modes , i.e. , the intrinsic and external ones .",
    "the former type includes damping due to diffusion , viscosity , thermal conduction and , possibly , also landau - like damping @xcite , while the latter type mainly comes from the neutral gas .",
    "the external damping is simply given by the imaginary part of the dispersion relation by @xmath146 , , whereas the intrinsic damping of collective modes involves complicated physical processes , and so far there has been no well founded theory of such processes for scdps .",
    "development of such a theory may be an interesting topic for future research , while , at this stage , we present several results from our simulation .",
    "figure [ fig_l_damping ] shows the profiles , or , more precisely , the cross sections at several fixed wave numbers , of the longitudinal wave spectra , @xmath32 , for @xmath94 and with different neutral damping rates @xmath7 .",
    "these profiles exhibit typical resonance shapes which describe the spectral distributions shown in figs .  1 - 7 , while their peak positions in the @xmath147-@xmath128 plane correspond to the dispersion relations .",
    "the above mentioned analytical theories give only the peak positions in the @xmath147-@xmath128 plane .",
    "in reality , these peaks are never delta - like functions , but rather have finite amplitudes and consequently finite widths due to various damping effects , as is shown in fig .  [ fig_l_damping ] .",
    "physically , the peak amplitudes indicate the amount of energy concentrated in various modes , while the widths of the peaks at half heights ( denoted as the half - widths , @xmath148 ) are related to damping @xcite .",
    "one notices a general tendency that the peak amplitudes decrease with the increase of wave - number .",
    "similar tendency was also observed in classical md simulation @xcite .",
    "in addition , with the increase of the neutral gas damping rate @xmath7 , all the heights decrease , while the widths increase .",
    "these tendencies are depicted more clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig_lt_damping ] , which shows the amplitudes and the half - widths of @xmath32 and @xmath33 versus wave - number for different @xmath7 .",
    "by using the brownian dynamics simulation , we have investigated the wave spectra of 2d dusty plasmas in states that cover a full range from a non - ideal gas to crystalline .",
    "the results are critically compared with dispersion relations for the dust - acoustic wave , dust - thermal wave , and those from the quasi - localized charge approximation and the harmonic approximation . in particular , simply extensions are considered to include the direct thermal effect and the critical cutoff wavenumber into the qlca .",
    "it is found that , for a non - ideal gaseous state ( e.g. , with @xmath79 ) , the longitudinal dtw is in a remarkably good agreement with the simulation , while for a perfect crystalline state ( e.g. , @xmath129 ) , the ha agrees very well with the simulation . in the states between those two opposing ends ,",
    "an overall good agreement between the extended versions of the qlca and the simulation was found for a wide range of wavelengths .",
    "the damping effect is also briefly discussed in terms of the peak amplitudes and the half - widths of the current - current correlation function for different neutral gas damping rate @xmath7 .",
    "a general tendency is that the peak amplitudes decrease with the increase of wave - number and the increase of @xmath7 , while the widths increase during these courses .",
