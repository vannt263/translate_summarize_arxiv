    "one of the main candidates for quantum gravity is loop quantum gravity which is canonical quantization of gravity using connection variables .",
    "it is background independent and non - perturbative .",
    "this last property makes it suitable for considering quantum effects on black holes and big bang .",
    "applying the theory to cosmology leads to loop quantum cosmology ( lqc)@xcite whose main equation for the evolution of the scale factor , that is the hamiltonian constraint , is a difference equation .",
    "this difference equation may be solved numerically@xcite , or exactly in some cases@xcite . also continuous approximation , in which the difference equation is approximated by a differential equation , maybe useful at least for some parts of the domain of the difference equation@xcite .",
    "the most important result of lqc is the resolution of big bang singularity@xcite .",
    "also there are phenomenological results from the effective equations that incorporates the modiffications of matter hamiltonian due to quantum gravity ( see e.g. @xcite )    here we shall study the possibility of adopting approximate methods based on variational methods for solving lqc difference equation . first we shall briefly review the variational methods for difference equations@xcite .",
    "then , we shall write an action functional appropriate for the difference equation of lqc and obtain the first integrals of the equation . next we shall find approximations to the solutions , not by solving the difference equation but by guessing a solution and optimizing the action , and compare these approximate solutions with the exact ones .",
    "here we summarize the results of ref .",
    "@xcite for a case suitable for our problem .",
    "suppose that we have an action of the form : @xmath0 in which @xmath1 is the degree of freedom of the system with lagrangian @xmath2 .",
    "the equation of motion is derived using the least action principle stating that the action should be stationary with respect to the variations @xmath3 .",
    "the variation in the lagrangian is : @xmath4 where the operators @xmath5 and @xmath6 are defined as : @xmath7 @xmath8 and the lowering operators @xmath9 and @xmath10 are defined as : @xmath11 defining the adjoint operators : @xmath12 @xmath13 and using the lagrange identity proved in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 means evaluation of the difference of the quantity at @xmath16 and @xmath17 and with : @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath19 and substituting in the action , one sees that the @xmath15 terms are zero by not varying the boundary ( initial ) conditions and the @xmath21 adjoint terms leads to the equation of motion as : @xmath22 and its complex conjugate .    in order to find first integrals of the above difference equation ,",
    "one first should define a symmetry of the lagrangian .",
    "a lagrangian is said to be symmetric under the transformation : @xmath23 provided one can find some @xmath24 for which : @xmath25 if a lagrangian is symmetric in this way , we have a constant of motion as : @xmath26",
    "the suitable lagrangian for lqc difference equation is : @xmath27 leading to the well  known equations of motion : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the matter contribution to the difference equation . ]",
    "@xmath30 in which @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the matter ( @xmath33 ) hamiltonian , and @xmath34 is the planck length .",
    "@xmath35 is the spin connection parameter defined as @xmath36 , so @xmath37 for a flat model and @xmath38 for a closed model . @xmath39 and @xmath40 are quantum ambiguities , @xmath41 is immirizi  barbero parameter , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 are the eigenvalues of the volume operator . changing to the variable @xmath44 and",
    "choosing @xmath45 leads to the difference equation mentioned in the text .",
    "although this discussion is about a massless scalar field , it is not hard to see that other matter sources as well as cosmological constant leads to the same form of difference equation . ]",
    "let us now investigate the first integrals .",
    "first consider the case @xmath37 and @xmath46 .",
    "then the lagrangian has translational symmetry generated by @xmath47 .",
    "this leads to @xmath48 .",
    "the corresponding conserved quantity is : @xmath49 which can be simply checked that it is conserved .",
    "for this case the equation of motion can be solved as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is an integer , and @xmath52 and @xmath53 are constants@xcite .",
    "it can be checked that @xmath54 .",
    "a more useful result can be obtained when one considers the complete lagrangian ( with matter and curvature contributions ) .",
    "the lagrangian has global phase transformation invariance .",
    "that is to say , under transformations @xmath55 or in its infinitesimal form @xmath56 , the corresponding @xmath57 is zero , and the conserved quantity can be found as : @xmath58 this conserved quantity can give some information about the relation between the real part and imaginary parts of @xmath59 .",
    "assuming @xmath60 one shall get @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a constant , and @xmath63 .",
    "the solution for @xmath64 is @xmath65 where @xmath66 is another constant .",
    "writing @xmath67 we have @xmath68 which can be solved for @xmath69 leading to the following relation between the real and imaginary parts of @xmath1 : @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are two other constants .",
    "the variational principle can also be used for deriving approximate solutions for cases in which one has not an exact solution .",
    "this can be done by guessing a solution and choosing the parameters such that the action takes its extremum value .",
    "we shall illustrate this method with some examples for which we have the exact solutions .",
    "the action is : @xmath73 one can guess a solution of type @xmath74 . substituting in the action we have : @xmath75 minimizing this leads to either @xmath76 or @xmath77 .",
    "both are exact solutions .",
    "a more general guess for @xmath59 is @xmath78 , leading to action : @xmath79 minimizing this leads to either @xmath77 , @xmath80 for which the solution is @xmath81 , or @xmath77 , @xmath82 where the solution becomes @xmath83 .",
    "both are exact solutions@xcite .",
    "now the action would be : @xmath85 guessing a solution of the form @xmath86 , we have : @xmath87 @xmath88 the problem is that these summations are divergent , so first we have to make them meaningful by changing the summation limits to @xmath89 . let s assume @xmath90 is real and positive .",
    "then we have @xmath91 since @xmath92 should goes to infinity we have @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "so the action is ( apart from a positive diverging term ) sum of two positive terms , one increasing ( with respect to @xmath90 ) and one decreasing , as it is seen in the figure ( [ fig ] ) .",
    "the minimum value is achieved when one puts this terms nearly equal .",
    "the minimization of the action , therefore is done by letting @xmath96 leading to @xmath97 with @xmath98 .",
    "so the solution is @xmath99 , which is again the exact solution@xcite .    as a result of introducing a cut  off ,",
    "the minimization depends on it .",
    "that is , if we translate the cut  off point from @xmath92 to @xmath100 ,",
    "the minimum point moves from the point where the derivative of @xmath101 is zero to the point where the derivative of @xmath101 equals to @xmath102 .",
    "the solution is to renormalize the regularized action via introducing the physical gravitational constant as : @xmath103 .",
    "now the action would be : @xmath105 guessing a solution of type @xmath106 , we have : @xmath107 @xmath108 again we make the action extremum by letting these two terms equal . to see why this is true , we note that the lagrangian ( [ last1 ] ) consists of two terms @xmath109 and @xmath110 ( where we have shifted @xmath17 by one ) . on the equation of motion ( [ last2 ] ) the second term would be @xmath111 .",
    "expanding @xmath112 and @xmath113 around @xmath114 we have @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "these are equal provided we assume either @xmath117 is real or purely imaginary .",
    "note that this is an approximate result since we expanded @xmath117 and choose only the first term of expansions .",
    "the condition that these two terms be of the same order leads to : @xmath118 which is clear that is either real or purely imaginary as we assumed .",
    "since we had expanded the first term , we have to have @xmath119 for usability of this solution . for @xmath120 with @xmath121 an arbitrary number , this condition holds .",
    "as an example let us find the solution for the special case in which the matter contribution is cosmological constant .",
    "the source term is : @xmath122 where @xmath123 is proportional to the cosmological constant .",
    "* @xmath124 in this case we have : @xmath125 @xmath126 which is very close to exact solution@xcite .",
    "* @xmath127 in this case we have : @xmath128 @xmath129 using the asymptotic forms of bessel functions one can see that this solution is in agreement with the exact ones , which are @xmath130 and @xmath131@xcite .",
    "in general , matter sources in large or small @xmath17 limit lead to a source term like @xmath132 . for different values of @xmath121",
    "the integral for @xmath114 can be calculated :    * @xmath133 ( large @xmath17 , massless matter ) @xmath134",
    "@xmath135 @xmath136 @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the elliptic function defined as : @xmath139 . * @xmath140 ( small @xmath17 , massless matter with the quantum ambiguity @xmath141 ) is the same as small @xmath17 , cosmological constant .",
    "* @xmath142 ( small @xmath17 , massless matter with @xmath143 ) is the same as large @xmath17 , cosmological constant .",
    "the continuous approximation can be simply achieved by expanding any @xmath59 around @xmath1 up to second order .",
    "the equation of motion is @xmath144 and the conserved quantity emerging from the phase invariance is @xmath145 this is the conserved current expected from the above equation of motion .",
    "we saw that it is possible to study the lqc difference equation using action functional formulation .",
    "we have shown that one can get acceptable solutions by guessing one and making the action optimized .",
    "the results are in agreement with numerical and other analytical methods in the literature ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "therefore the method presented here is useful for obtaining analytical solutions in different regimes and for different matter sources ."
