    "sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 , the only layered perovskite that becomes superconducting without the presence of cu , was predicted to be a candidate spin - triplet superconductor with a pairing symmetry analogous to that of superfluid @xmath3he - a phase.@xcite experimental data has been accumulating in the past two decades supporting that sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1  is an odd - parity , spin - triplet ( possibly chiral @xmath2-wave ) superconductor.@xcite one of the most remarkable phenomena expected for spin - triplet states is the emergence of the half - quantum vortices which is associated with the magnetic flux just half of the flux quantum @xmath4.@xcite however , confirmed evidence for such a state is still lacking in superfluidity of @xmath3he .",
    "recently , half - height magnetization steps found in cantilever torque experiments on micron - sized doubly - connected samples of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1  suggest that half flux quantum  states may indeed exist in a spin - triplet superconductor.@xcite    in a conventional singlet superconductor , the single - valuedness of the order parameter demands that the scalar phase changes by integral multiples of @xmath5 in a closed path ; therefore , the magnetic flux trapped around a singularity must be integral multiples of @xmath6 .",
    "the flux quantization was experimentally proved first by the magnetic torque measurements.@xcite in a thin - wall , doubly - connected cylinder , where the wall thickness ( @xmath7 ) is much smaller than the penetration depth ( @xmath8 ) , the supercurrent velocity @xmath9 is not necessarily zero .",
    "it is essentially the fluxoid @xmath10 rather than the flux @xmath11 through the cylinder which is quantized , defined as @xmath12d@xmath13 .",
    "therefore , @xmath9 is a periodic function of @xmath11 , given by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the radius of the cylinder .",
    "the periodicity in @xmath9 results in an oscillating superconducting transition temperature ( @xmath16 ) and hence the oscillation of sample resistance ( @xmath17 ) in the transition regime .",
    "this is so - called little - parks ( lp ) effect , which provided a precise measurement of the periodicity of flux quantum.@xcite    half flux quantum states are allowed in a spin - triplet superconductor due to the presence of a spin current .",
    "the single - valuedness of the order parameter can be achieved by simultaneously changing the spin - phase and the orbital - phase by @xmath18 .",
    "only the winding of the orbital - phase couples to the magnetic vector potential , leading to a flux of @xmath6/2 .",
    "an equivalent view is that the two cooper - pair spin components in the equal spin pairing ( esp ) states , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , have different windings .",
    "when the winding numbers of spin up and down components differ by unity , the total winding number for the charge current has a half - integer value , accompanied by non - zero spin current .",
    "the existence of half flux quantum  states has been supported by recent cantilever experiments on micron - sized annular sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1  crystals.@xcite the magnetic moment of the samples is measured , which is proportional to the flux generated by the supercurrents circulating around the hole .",
    "only the jumps of magnetic moment corresponding to the entry of a full flux quantum into the annulus were found as sweeping the axial magnetic field . however , by simultaneously applying a constant in - plane magnetic field , these jumps split into two separate jumps with half the height of the original , which can be explained by the entry of half flux quantum . by further increasing the in - plane field , the stability region of the half - height states grows broader .",
    "the lp effect measurements on micron - sized rings of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1  have been recently carried out by our group with the application of an out - of - plane field alone@xcite .",
    "the observed oscillation period is consistent with that expected for a flux of @xmath6 , with no indication of half flux quantum  states . at a sufficiently large magnetic field @xmath21200 g , an abrupt increase in the oscillation period occurs for thick wall rings , which is proposed to be relevant to the decoration of vortex lattice . large amplitude and number of magnetoresistance oscillations were observed at a broad temperature range , suggesting a nature of unconventional lp effect , which is vortex motion involved fluxoid quantization . by applying a large enough measurement current , vortex - flow - dominated resistance oscillations allows us to detect the samples at low temperatures away from @xmath16 . however , how the vortex motion with a strong current dependence affect the free energy in a @xmath2-wave superconductor has not been well understood .",
    "further detailed studies are required . in the calculation discussed below ,",
    "we only consider free energy modulation without the vortex motion .",
    "the stability condition of half flux quantum  states is determined by its energy cost relative to that of full flux  states .",
    "different from the neutral systems in @xmath3he , the screening effect of the charged currents in a spin - triplet superconductor needs to be considered , which requires the use of the gibbs free energy .",
    "based on phenomenological theories with fermi liquid corrections , the gibbs free energy per unit length of thin - walled circular geometry , obtained analytically @xcite , has the form @xmath22 -\\left(\\frac{\\phi_a}{\\phi_0}\\right)^2\\right ) \\end{multlined}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the screening parameter , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are charge and spin supercurrent densities , and @xmath26 is the applied flux through the ring . in terms of the integer - valued winding numbers of spin up ( @xmath27 ) and down ( @xmath28 ) components ,",
    "the winding numbers for orbital and spin parts of the order parameter are introduced as @xmath29 and @xmath30 . by making the energy of half flux quantum  state , @xmath31 , lower than that of full flux  states , @xmath32 or @xmath33 , at @xmath34",
    ", we obtain the stability condition for the half flux quantum  states as @xmath35 the stability condition indicates that the sample size needs to be sufficiently small for a given @xmath36 in order to keep the half flux quantum  energetically favorable .",
    "the energy cost of half flux quantum  diverges with the sample size , because the spin current is not screened within the penetration depth as charge currents do .",
    "recent theoretical studies suggest that the stability region of half flux quantum states can be expanded by applying an in - plane magnetic field.@xcite a non - zero spin polarization develops in the @xmath37-plane in half flux quantum  states , due to a velocity mismatch of the two cooper - pair spin components . by being coupled to an in - plane magnetic field ,",
    "the half flux quantum  states become energetically more favorable compared to full flux  states , and therefore the stability region of the half flux quantum  states grows .",
    "the free energy contribution from the in - plane field coupling is given@xcite @xmath38 however , one down - side of applying an in - plane field is when it reaches @xmath39 , parallel abrikosov vortices will penetrate the samples . in the cantilever measurements , the entry of parallel vortices",
    "is accompanied by the field shift of the transitions and the reduction in the stability region of the half flux quantum  states . a london theory approximation for a tall cylinder with a diameter of 1.6 @xmath40 m gives an estimated value of @xmath41 210 oe.@xcite    we carried out magnetoresistance measurements on micron - sized superconducting rings of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1  to study the competition between the full and the half flux quantum  states .",

    "an anomalous transition with negative d@xmath17/d@xmath42 is found , which can be explained by charge imbalance effect due to the non - uniformity of superconductivity in mesoscopic samples .",
