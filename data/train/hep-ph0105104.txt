    "strangeness follows this systematics and since their production mechanism is quite different at low and at high energies it seems that particle yields are losing information about dynamics . however , there are some characteristic features of the system at chemical freezeout in central a+a collisions being only present at sps and rhic : i ) chemical freezeout temperature is within errors consistent with the critical temperature and ii ) strangeness is un - correlated and redistributed in the whole volume of a thermal fireball .",

    ", strangeness is strongly correlated in the volume @xmath55 and thus has to be conserved exactly and locally ( canonical description ) . in high energy a+a reactions , there are already sufficiently many strange particles being produced per event such that strangeness is conserved on the average and is distributed in the whole volume of the fireball ( grand canonical description ) .",
    "if thermal description of particle productions is correct , strangeness enhancement from p+p to a+a collisions appears naturally as a transition from the canonical to the grand canonical regime .",
    "hence strangeness enhancement does not necessarily require deconfinement and should also be observable at lower collision energies where the conditions for deconfinement are not satisfied .",
