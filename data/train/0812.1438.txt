    "enigmatic extended radio sources in rich galaxy clusters have been known for over 30 years ( willson 1970 ; for recent review , see feretti 2005 ) .",
    "sources located at the cluster center are referred to as `` radio halos '' , while those on the cluster periphery are called `` relics '' .",
    "steep spectra and spectral cutoffs at a few ghz detected in several halos / relics indicate that relativistic electrons with typically gev energy are undergoing cooling due to synchrotron and inverse compton ( ic ) emission . in every case ,",
    "the radio halos / relics are found in irregular clusters which are apparently undergoing mergers .",
    "this suggests that the radio emitting electrons are accelerated by shocks or turbulence generated by energetic cluster merging .",
    "the same relativistic electrons scatter cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons up to the hard x - ray band ( ic emission ) . by comparing the radio and the hard x - ray emissions , not only the electron energy density but",
    "also the intra - cluster magnetic field intensity can be estimated ( e.g. sarazin 1988 ) .",
    "detecting the ic emission is difficult because of the strong icm component dominant below @xmath9 kev and the low expected flux of the emission in hard x - rays above this energy . currently , there are only a few reports claiming its detection , mostly from the _ beppo - sax _ pds in the energy band around 40 kev or higher ( e.g. fusco - femiano et al .",
    "1999 ; nevalainen et al .",

    "2006 ; rephaeli et al . 2006 ) as well .",
    "another case includes the _ asca _ gis results around 4 kev on galaxy groups ( fukazawa et al .",

    "these results would require a magnetic field as low as 0.1 @xmath10 g",
    "( e.g. fusco - femiano et al .  1999 ) , which at the first glance is inconsistent with the radio rotation measure estimation of @xmath11 @xmath10 g ( e.g. clarke et al .",

    "further observations by independent instruments of ic and other hard x - ray emission processes ( e.g. inoue et al .",
    "2005 ) , is thus desirable .",
    "significant heating of the icm itself must also be taking place in merging clusters ( e.g. takizawa 2000 ; ricker & sarazin 2001 ) .",
    "x - ray hardness ratio images sometimes show temperatures exceeding 10 kev ( e.g. watanabe et al .  1999 ; briel et al .",
    "2004 ) . since the emission can be multi - phase within the line of sight",
    ", the actual highest temperature can be much higher , though it is not easy to identify using the contemporary imaging x - ray detectors working below @xmath12  kev .    in many ways ,",
    "abell 3667 is the ideal cluster to study mergers , radio relics and hard x - ray emission .",
    "it is a very bright x - ray cluster at a low redshift of @xmath13 ( struble & rood 1999 ) .",
    "rosat _ and _ asca _ observations showed that it is a spectacular merger with shock heated gas ( markevitch et al .",
    "_ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations have shown much evidence for an ongoing merger , such as a cold front ( vikhlinin et al .  2001a , b ) and highly inhomogeneous temperature structure with temperature ranging from 4 to @xmath0 kev ( mazzotta et al .",
    "2002 ; briel et al .",
    "the optical galaxy distribution shows elongation towards the north - west south - east axis ( sodre et al .",
    "1992 ; johnston - hollitt et al .",
    "2008 ) , supporting the binary merger scenario as well .",
    "the cluster is famous for its pair of radio relics ( e.g. roettgering et al .",
    "the relic to the north - west is the brightest and largest among the diffuse radio sources associated with cluster of galaxies , having a flux of 3.7 jy ( johnston - hollit 2004 ) and a width of @xmath14 at 1.4 ghz .",
    "it is located about @xmath15 or 2 mpc from the cluster x - ray centroid .",
    "the radio signal is detected from 85 mhz to 2.3 ghz , and its average photon index is @xmath16 ( roettgering et al .",
    "here the photon index @xmath17 is defined as @xmath18 .",
    "the radio relics have very sharp outer edges and the radio spectra steepen with distance from the edge .",
    "thus , the radio relics are considered to reflect the position of the particle acceleration in a merger shock .",
    "the cluster is also a good candidate for detection of ic emission .",
    "the _ beppo - sax _ pds provided a rather marginal evidence of hard excess emission from the cluster ( fusco - femiano et al .",
    "2001 ; nevalainen et al .",
    "however , the large field of view ( fov ) of the pds makes the data strongly affected by contamination from thermal emission from the entire cluster , mainly from its central region , and possible agns .    the hard x - ray detector ( hxd ; takahashi et al .",

    "in addition , the x - ray ccd cameras ( xiss ; koyama et al .",
    "2006 ) onboard _ suzaku _ are characterized by their large effective areas and low and stable detector backgrounds , which make them very powerful devices to observe extended hard emission .    in may 2006 , we observed abell 3667 cluster using _ suzaku _ with three pointings running from the north - west relic to the center , each separated by @xmath20 .",
    "here we report the results obtained by these observations .",

    "+    since the region coincides in position with the diffuse radio emission , the detected x - rays might be of non - thermal origin . as an extreme case",
    ", we fit the spectra with a power - law model . because of the 0.9 kev hump , which indicates a contribution from @xmath26 kev thermal component",
    ", we utilized the energy band above 1.5 kev in this fitting .",
    "we also limit it to below 6.0 kev since the nxb systematic error dominates above this energy .",
    "the results are listed in table [ table : pl_1/3nwr ] .",
    "the power - law fit is acceptable with a null - hypothesis probability of 51% .",
    "taking into account the large systematic errors associated with the nxb and cxb ( see figure [ fig:17_nwr_spec1]c ) , we can not distinguish whether the emission is thermal or non - thermal from spectroscopy only .    in figure [",
    "fig : a3667_projection ] , we present the projected x - ray count - rate map in the energy bands of 12 kev , 24 kev and 48 kev derived from all the three xis - fi detectors . here , the bi chip is not utilized because of its higher background .",
    "regions around the two point source in the nwr data are excluded in the plot .",
    "overlaid is the profile of the sumss 843 mhz radio image , which clearly shows the relic , located @xmath27 mpc ) away from the x - ray centroid . from the 12 kev and 24 kev profiles ,",
    "it is clear that the cluster emission was detected out to the region @xmath28 from the cluster x - ray centroid , which corresponds to 2.6 mpc in projected distance . on the other hand ,",
    "there is apparently no excess signal associated with the radio relic , smoothly connecting the inner icm x - rays to the cxb component at the outermost region .",
    "thus , a significant fraction of the x - rays in the nwr region was naturally assumed to be of thermal origin .    using this plot",
    ", we roughly evaluated the upper - limit of the projected non - thermal count rates associated with the relic . here",
    ", we assumed that the ic emission has the same morphology to that of the radio emission , and the 28 kev x - ray counts within region b in figure [ fig : a3667_projection ] are the upper - limit to the ic emission .",
    "the cxb is estimated from region c , and its fluctuation is calculated to be 22% on both the region a and b. taking the statistical error and the cxb fluctuation into account , relative count - rate of region b to that of region a is derived as @xmath29 while that of the radio flux is @xmath30 .",
    "thus , we concluded that @xmath31% , i.e. larger than 24% , of the emission in region a+b is of thermal origin .",
    "since the region a+b coincides with the norht - west relic region , we combine this result with the power - law fitting results ( table [ table : pl_1/3nwr ] ) .",
    "in addition , because the radio emission within the spectral fitting region only covers 90% of the total relic flux in the sumss image , we multiply the xis flux by a factor of 1.1 to account for any missing nonthermal flux .",
    "finally , we obtain the 1040 kev upper limit ic flux for the north - west radio relic as a whole as @xmath7 erg s@xmath5 @xmath6 allowing @xmath17 to vary , at the 90% confidence level . with this flux",
    ", the photon index is required to be @xmath32 .",
    "if we fix it to @xmath16 , the 1040 kev upper limit flux become @xmath33 erg s@xmath5 @xmath6 .",
    "we analyzed the _ suzaku _ mapping observation data of a merging cluster abell  3667 .",
    "the xis detects emission from the cluster out to @xmath34 or 2.6 mpc from the cluster x - ray centroid .",
    "the pin spectra of the three pointings commonly prefer soft - shaped spectra , suggesting that the thermal contribution from the cluster icm is the major origin of these signals . from the xis+pin combined analysis of the center pointing , a multi - phase picture such as the @xmath35 model , the @xmath36 model or the @xmath37 model is suggested . in the former case",
    ", @xmath38 is derived to exceed 13.2 kev , with the best fit value around 20 kev , while @xmath39 is around @xmath40 kev . using the @xmath37 model with one of the temperature fixed at 7.5 kev ,",
    "the fit is also acceptable , while a component wiht @xmath41 kev is still required .",
    "this result suggests the existence of a very hot ( @xmath42 kev ) component around the cluster center .",
    "the xis spectra of the 17@xmath43 offset pointing can be fitted using the @xmath44 model with @xmath45 kev , while that of the southern one third of the nwr pointing ( the 1/3 nw - south region ) requires a cooler value , around 4 kev .",
    "the pin signal in the nwr pointing , as well as the @xmath46 offset pointing , can be explained by the icm contribution with either the @xmath35 picture suggested by the center pointing or the @xmath44 picture fitted to the @xmath46 offset xis data .",
    "the shape of the pin spectra of the center and 17@xmath43 offset pointings are too soft to account for the @xmath16 ic emission suggested from the radio observation .",
    "thus , the wide - band _ suzaku _ x - ray spectra do not show any signature of the ic emission associated with the strong ( @xmath47 jy at 1.4 ghz ) radio synchrotron emission .    using the hxd , the overall upper - limit 1040 kev flux on the non - thermal emission within a @xmath3 fov around the north - west radio relic",
    "is derived to be @xmath48 erg s@xmath5 cm @xmath49 with the @xmath44 icm modeling .",
    "the icm modeling using the _ xmm_-pn spectra gives a similar upper limit . using the xis , the upper - limit on the ic emission from the radio relic itself is derived to be @xmath33 erg s@xmath5 cm @xmath49 , when converted into the 1040 kev band and assuming @xmath16 . if we allow the index to be free , i.e. assume that there is a spectral break somewhere above 10 kev , the upper - limit value became @xmath7 erg s@xmath5 @xmath6 .      by combining the radio and x - ray observations , here",
    "we estimate the magnetic field strength in the north - west radio relic . from the radio observation ,",
    "the relic has a flux of 3.7 jy at 1.4 ghz ( johnston - hollit 2008 ) .",
    "its radio fluxes at 85 mhz , 843 mhz , 1.4 ghz and 2.3 ghz are reported to roughly follow the power law with @xmath16 ( roettgering et al .",
    "1997 ) . with a magnetic field of @xmath50 g , the 85 mhz radio emission requires electrons with a lorentz factor @xmath51 of @xmath52 , which in turn emits ic photon at around 20 kev . in the case of 1.4 ghz radio emission , they are @xmath53 and 350 kev , respectively .",
    "thus , we will assume that the photon index is similar to @xmath16 above 20 kev , when the magnetic field is stronger than 1 @xmath10 g .",
    "the radio flux at the 80320 mhz band , which corresponds to the @xmath9 kev ic emission with @xmath54 g , is derived as @xmath55 , assuming a @xmath56 power - law emission and a flux of 3.7 jy at 1.4 ghz .",
    "the xis upper - limit right on the north - west radio relic region is derived as @xmath57 , again assuming a simple @xmath56 power law . by dividing these two values ,",
    "we obtain @xmath58 @xmath59 here , @xmath60 g is the equivalent magnetic field of the energy density of the cmb .",
    "thus , the magnetic field in the north - west radio relic is inferred to be @xmath61 g .",
    "since the radio emission is detected only down to 85 mhz , the ic spectra below @xmath9 kev might have a break .",
    "for the electrons with @xmath62 within a thermal gas density of @xmath63 @xmath64 ( derived from the xis results ) , the dominant cooling processes are the ic and the synchrotron emissions .",
    "these give a cooling time of @xmath65 years .",
    "if the duration of electron injection is shorter than this time - scale , the electron distribution below this energy is not affected by the cooling , and the resultant ic ( and synchrotron ) photon index can be harder , typically @xmath66 . from the @xmath17 free power - law fitting to the xis spectra obtained from the north - west relic region , we know that the upper - limit ic flux in the 1040 kev band is @xmath67 . in this model ,",
    "the photon index is 1.6 around 4 kev , and breaks to 2.1 above @xmath9 kev . in this case , the magnetic field strength is inferred to be @xmath68 g .",
    "these results are consistent with the radio rotation measure observations of this relic , suggesting 35 @xmath10 g ( johnston - hollitt 2004 ) .    based on the observable parameters , we calculate the energy density of individual components in the north - west radio relic .",
    "the thermal particle density and temperature give an energy density @xmath69 of 1.0 ev @xmath64 . here",
    ", we simply assume that all x - rays in the north - west relic are of thermal origin . with a magnetic field strength of @xmath70 @xmath10 g and @xmath71 @xmath10 g ,",
    "the energy density @xmath72 is derived as @xmath73 ev @xmath64 or @xmath74 ev @xmath64 , respectively . here , on the contrary , we assume that most of the x - rays are of ic origin to give an upper limit on @xmath75 . if a power - law distribution of relativistic electrons are assumed within @xmath76 , the energy density of electrons @xmath75 is @xmath77 ev @xmath64 . here",
    "the minimum @xmath51 is assumed to be the critical lorentz factor below where ionization losses dominate ( sarazin 1999 ) .",
    "although @xmath75 strongly depends on the unknown electron distribution below @xmath78 , the calculated upper - limit value is not so far from the equi - partition condition .",
    "the ratio between the non - thermal ( @xmath72 and @xmath79 ) and thermal ( @xmath69 ) energy density is inferred to be as large as 20% .",
    "although @xmath75 has a large uncertainty , the lower limit on @xmath80 is much more robust . in addition",
    ", @xmath81 is a strong limit . if we assume , for example , that about a half of the x - rays in the north - west relic are of thermal origin and the latter half is of ic origin , @xmath69 is decreased by a factor of @xmath82 and the lower limit on the @xmath83 is doubled . in this case",
    ", the ratio becomes as high as 19% , excluding the @xmath75 contribution .",
    "our results are generally consistent with those by rottgering et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , though they do not discuss in detail the magnetic field .",
    "this demonstrates that magnetic fields stronger than 1 @xmath10 g exist on scales as large as the cluster virial radius and exert non - negligible pressure compared to the thermal one , at least around the region of the north - west relic .",
    "recent observations of radio relics around other clusters have also revealed similarly strong magnetic fields of @xmath84 g ( e.g. henriksen & mushotzky 2001 ; feretti & neumann 2006 ; hubert et al .",
    "2008 ) . that of the abell 3667 north - west relic is the",
    "strongest yet observed .",
    "it is important to note that the large magnetic field we have found applies only to the interior of the radio relic .",
    "thus , it is possible that most clusters do not have such large fields at such outer radii .",
    "the relic is the brightest diffuse cluster radio source known , and its interior may not be typical of the diffuse intracluster medium outside the relic , or in other clusters .",
    "it may be that the magnetic field and seed relativistic particles were injected into this region by an agn in the past ( e.g. ensslin & gopal - krishna 2001 ) .",
    "if the relativistic electrons were accelerated by a merger shock , the same shock may have amplified the magnetic field , perhaps by some mechanism like the weibel instability ( e.g. okabe & hattori 2003 ; fujita et al .",
    "2006 ; kato 2007 ) or the cosmic ray streaming instability ( lucek & bell 2000 , bell 2004 ) . also , abell  3667 has undergone a very dramatic merger , and may not be typical of more relaxed clusters .",
    "the hxd - pin data of the nwr pointing provides an upper - limit on the ic emission as @xmath85 erg s@xmath5 @xmath6 .",
    "since the fov of the pin is @xmath86 times larger than the region used in the xis analysis , it provides valuable limits on any non - thremal electrons that may be distributed on scales larger than the north - west relic .",
    "these electrons , in addition , are not readily observable in the radio band . for example , if the relic is surrounded by a larger region with lower magnetic field , say @xmath87 g , electrons therein with @xmath78 would be unobservable through their synchrotron emission since its frequency is less than 10 mhz .    using the _ beppo - sax _",
    "pds data with an equivalent exposure ( 113 ks ) to the nwr pointing , fusco - femiano et al .",
    "( 2001 ) derived the upper - limit hard x - ray flux of @xmath88 erg s@xmath5 @xmath6 in the 2080 kev band assuming a @xmath56 power - law emission . here",
    ", they fixed the icm temperature to 7 kev and included only the statistical errors . using the same data with similar thermal model , nevalainen et al .",
    "( 2004 ) presented a 90% confidence upper limit flux of @xmath89 erg s@xmath5 @xmath6 in the same energy band assuming a power - law with @xmath90 .",
    "the main difference in the two results is that the latter author took into account the possible systematics in the pds background modeling and agn contribution derived in their own manner .    by comparing the observational results on the crab",
    ", we found that the 2080 kev flux derived from _ beppo - sax _",
    "pds is 21% smaller than those derived from _",
    "suzaku_. thus , results from fusco - femiano et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and nevalainen et al .",
    "( 2004 ) can be converted into _",
    "suzaku_-equivalent fluxes of @xmath91 and @xmath92 erg s@xmath5 @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "therefore , our _ suzaku _ result provides more stringent upper limit on the flux , compared to these two results .",
    "furthermore , it is focused on a more spatially restricted region around the north - west radio relic , thanks to the narrow fov of the hxd ( @xmath93 fwhm ) compared to that of the pds ( @xmath94  fwhm ) .",
    "the hxd - pin results from the cluster center shows a `` soft - shaped '' hard component with @xmath95 , which can be best interpreted as a very hot component with a temperature of @xmath96 kev , in addition to the @xmath97 kev component in the @xmath35 picture combined with the xis spectra . using the @xmath37 model , the temperature of the very hot component is required to be higher than 20 kev . since the spectra can be marginally fitted with a @xmath98 power - law component as well",
    ", the emission could be of non - thermal origin , or contamination from a yet unknown compton - thick agn .",
    "however , our contaminating point - source survey ( appendix [ apdx : point_src ] ) and the softness of the spectral shape itself suggests the thermal interpretation . since the excess signal to the @xmath44 component is significant in the center pointing , the very hot component can be significant around the cluster center .",
    "detailed modeling of the icm using all the available data , including our new xmm data to be obtained soon , will help clarifying the actual value .",
    "from the _ asca _ observations , this cluster is known to host significant temperature inhomogeniety , showing regions with a temperature as high as 10 kev together with the 46 kev dominant emission ( markevitch 1998 ) .",
    "later , briel , finoguenov & henry ( 2004 ) also showed the complex multi temperature nature of the icm using the _ xmm _ data .",
    "the temperature ranges from 4 kev to 8 kev , and several hot regions are visible around the cluster center .",
    "since these analyses are based on the projected x - ray color maps , the temperature of the actual hottest component can be higher considering the convolution along the line - of - sight .",
    "the _ beppo - sax _ pds spectrum is consistent with the center-@xmath35 model taking into account all the systematic errors .",
    "thus , our results on `` soft - shaped '' hard component is basically consistent with existing data .",
    "such a very hot component , with a temperature as high as 20 kev , is suggested by many hydrodynamical simulations of merging clusters right after the time of impact ( e.g. takizawa 2000 ; ricker & sarazin 2001 ) .",
    "since the abell  3667 cluster is considered to be at this stage , the very hot component will be the hottest heated icm emission .",
    "we note that a similar very hot component is suggested in the cluster rxj1347.51145 ( ota et al .",
    "2008 ) using the _ suzaku _ wide - band data combined with _",
    "its high temperature and relatively large luminosity means that the very hot component can not be in pressure balance with the cooler one , otherwise , it will dominate the volume in the cluster .",
    "thus , the emission should be temporary originating from the shock and/or the compression heating , and is expected to disappear soon by adiabatic expansion . to investigate the location of the emission",
    ", we will need much wider energy band coverage in the imaging detector , specifically , arcmin - scale imaging spectroscopy up to @xmath99 kev .",
    "from _ suzaku _ mapping observations of abell  3667 , upper - limits on the non - thermal ( hard ) x - ray emission were obtained . on the north - west radio relic itself , the xis limit of 7.3@xmath100 erg s@xmath5 @xmath6 extrapolated to the 1040 kev band",
    "provides a lower - limit magnetic field of @xmath101 g .",
    "the non - thermal energy density there is estimated to be higher than 7% , and likely near 20% .    by combining the xis and the _ xmm _ mapping data to the hxd - pin spectra ,",
    "the upper limit on the 1040 kev excess hard emission is derived as 1.05.3@xmath4 erg s@xmath5 @xmath6 , depending on the modeling of the icm . since the north - west relic has a magnetic field of @xmath102 @xmath10 g and",
    "hence must be almost an order of magnitude darker than this hard x - ray limit , the relativistic electrons must be distributed in regions other than the relic with low magnetic field ( of @xmath103 g ) if ic hard x - ray emission near the flux limit exists .",
    "the pin data from the pointing on the cluster center shows hard x - rays in excess to the averaged icm emission , which is thought to have a temperature of around 7  kev .",
    "although other interpretations can not be rejected , its soft spectral shape indicates the emission to be possibly from a very hot thermal component with a temperature of @xmath9 kev , generated temporary in the cluster merger phase .    in the near future ,",
    "x - ray observatories with hard x - ray imaging optics operating up to 40 kev will be launched , such as the astro - h ( former next ; e.g. takahashi et al 2006 ) , nustar and simbol - x ( e.g. ferrando et al .",
    "these detectors will drastically improve the sensitivity to both point sources and relatively clumpy extended hard x - rays , such as the local non - thermal emission associated with the radio halos / relics and the very hot component .",
    "in addition , the soft gamma - ray detector onboard astro - h , ( a collimated instrument ) features the highest sensitivity at around 100 kev using the novel narrow - field - of - view compton camera concept . it will open a new window to the widely distributed non - thermal emission , which is difficult to separate from the icm thermal emission below @xmath104  kev .",

    "it gave a @xmath108 16% higher normalization for the power - law component , which is consistent with the expected fluctuation of cxb , discussed later in this section .",
    "the `` galactic component '' parameters are similar , but the flux is brighter by a factor of 25 , which is also consistent with its sky fluctuations . because the 1/3 nw - north region could be contaminated by the outskirts of the cluster icm emission , we modeled the cxb with the power - law component fixed at the value obtained from the lockman hole observation , while the `` galactic component '' was fixed at that of the 1/3 nw - north region .",
    "the cxb fluctuations can be modeled as @xmath109 . here",
    ", @xmath110 is the effective solid angle and @xmath111 is the upper cutoff flux . from the heao-1 a2 results , shafer ( 1983 ) derived @xmath112% , with @xmath113 deg@xmath114 and @xmath115 erg s@xmath5 @xmath6 . by scaling this result with the xis parameters , i.e. @xmath116 deg@xmath114 and @xmath117 erg s@xmath5 @xmath6 in the cluster vicinity , we obtain the cxb fluctuation over the xis full fov as 11% ( 90% confidence level ) . for the nwr 1/3 nw - north region ,",
    "the value is then 19% . for the north - west relic region with @xmath118 deg@xmath114 and",
    "@xmath119 erg s@xmath5 @xmath6 , it becomes 15.9% .",
    "note that this scaling relation is consistent with the _ asca _ and _ ginga _ cxb analysis ( ishisaki 1997 ) .",
    "the cxb flux in the pin is modeled as a cutoff power - law , described as @xmath120 in @xmath121 . here , @xmath122 is an folding energy , and @xmath123 is the normalization . in energies below @xmath124  kev ,",
    "the hxd energy response for a diffuse source is the same to that for a point source except for its normalization .",
    "thus , we simply scaled our cxb model to the solid angle of the hxd , @xmath125 deg@xmath114 and utilized the hxd nominal response .",
    "we first used the parameters based on the heao-1 results ( boldt 1987 ) , which gave @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "we then compared this model to the xis observation of lockman hole , on which our xis cxb modeling is based on .",
    "it was found that the model predicts a flux 8.6% lower in the xis 3 - 8 kev band data .",
    "thus , we modified the pin cxb model normalization to match the difference , as @xmath129 .",
    "note that although there is an apparent difference in photon index between the cxb model of the xis and pin , the cutoff function in the later makes two models perfectly matched in the energy band at 38 kev . through the same approach applied to the xis data , the cxb fluctuation in the hxd fov",
    "is expected to be @xmath130% , with @xmath125 deg@xmath114 and a conservative upper cutoff flux of @xmath131 erg s@xmath5 @xmath6 in the 1040 kev band .",
    "( 7.5cm,7.5cm)figure13.eps    since the pin has a wider fov ( @xmath132 bottom to bottom ) than that of the xis ( @xmath133 ) and also lacks imaging capability , signal contamination from point sources within the fov should be carefully estimated .",
    "figure  [ fig : pspc_src ] shows the pspc image of abell  3667 with the fovs of the pin superposed .",
    "the pspc data is processed through the method described by snowden et al .",
    "there exists seven x - ray point sources in the pin fovs .",
    "we identified these sources using the simbad astronomical database .",
    "source 4 and source 6 are in the fov of xis , and thus their flux is estimated by the xis data .",
    "although the other sources are outside the fov of xis , archival data of _ asca _ gis are available for the sources 1 , 2 , 3 , and 5 .",
    "we therefore extracted the gis spectra of source 1 thorough source 6 and fitted them with a power low modified by galactic absorption .",
    "blank sky observations of the gis were used for the background of source 1,2 and 3 , while neighboring field is used for source 5 .    using the best - fit parameters",
    ", we simulated the pin spectra of the six sources for the three pointings , considering the pin transmission to each of them on the three pointings .",
    "the total contribution of the six point sources thus estimated is more than an order of magnitude lower than the detected signal , and hence negligible .",
    "source 7 , not included in this estimation , is located at the boundary of the pin fov of the center pointing .",
    "it is also a weak hard x - ray source , since it is a distant cluster of galaxies ."
