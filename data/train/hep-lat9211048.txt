    "last year we reported preliminary results @xcite for the heavy - light decay constants @xmath3 and @xmath4 from wall - source lattices at .",
    "we found that systematic effects contributed to the previously - observed discrepancy @xcite between the large - mass extrapolation of `` conventional '' lattice calculations ( i.e. , two propagating wilson quarks ) and the static method of eichten @xcite .    in this paper , we present our final results for this calculation and focus primarily on the issues which led to the elimination of the discrepancy .",
    "first , we discuss briefly the way in which wilson quarks have been adapted for use when the mass is near or larger than the lattice cut - off ( i.e. , where @xmath5 ) .",
    "second , we present a more comprehensive study of the static computation at  and attempt to reduce higher - state contamination in this result . to compute the physical @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons , we interpolate between these two methods ; our results include estimates of various possible systematic errors .",
    "the calculation of the heavy - light decay constant is best formulated in terms of the large - mass scaling quantity @xmath6 , where we use @xmath7 to refer to a pseudoscalar of arbitrary heavy- and light - quark masses .",
    "we compute it using the formula @xmath8^{1/2}\\phantom{;}a^{-3/2}.\\ ] ] the quantities @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the fitted large - time amplitudes of the two correlation functions , @xmath11 , the `` smeared - point , '' and @xmath12 , the `` smeared - smeared . ''",
    "( here `` point '' refers to the local lattice axial current and `` smeared '' to an extended pseudoscalar interpolating operator defined in coulomb gauge . )",
    "@xmath13 normalizes the lattice current to the continuum one , i.e. , @xmath14 .",
    "for the conventional method , we use @xmath15 where , for example , @xmath16 here @xmath17 refers to the heavy , light quark .",
    "comparison to the spatially summed free - quark propagator gives the quark - field normalization at leading order in large @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "one expects corrections of order @xmath18 and of order @xmath19 ; the former can be further reduced by tadpole improvement @xcite , embodied in the use of @xmath20 and @xmath21 , instead of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , in ( [ am ] ) .",
    "we attempt to estimate the size of the latter below .",
    "note that only in the factor @xmath24 is the tadpole approximation used .",
    "for the leading perturbative correction to the axial current we retain the full result @xcite , @xmath25 , and use a `` boosted '' value of the coupling ( @xmath26 at ) @xcite .    for the static calculation , we extract residues of the bare correlation functions , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , to determine @xmath29 in a formula analogous to ( [ fplatt ] ) . here",
    "we use the normalization constant @xcite @xmath30 this form is convenient for later purposes .",
    "note that equation ( [ ca ] ) produces the usual normalization for the decay constant when _ both _ quarks are light , since the factors of @xmath31 .",
    "furthermore , it matches to the static limit ( up to perturbative corrections ) , since , in the tadpole approximation , @xmath32 as @xmath33 .",
    "consider , though , the error made in the intermediate mass regime , where one hopes to obtain the @xmath34 correction to the static limit . in a hopping expansion for the heavy quark , one finds that @xmath35 , and that sub - leading terms enter with additional powers of @xmath22 .",
    "thus from the standpoint of nrqcd @xcite , the @xmath34 corrections to the static term will be exponentially suppressed , and the relative importance of the kinetic and @xmath36 contributions will be misrepresented .",
    "we improve the situation as follows . in the non - relativistic limit , at arbitrary @xmath2 , the ( tadpole improved ) free - quark dispersion relation , @xmath37 ,",
    "contains the kinetic mass @xmath38 in this limit , the rest mass @xmath39 is irrelevant in the calculation of @xmath40 , but it clearly contributes to the pole mass , @xmath41 .",
    "thus , assuming that non - tadpole - interaction effects are sub - dominant , the shifted value @xmath42 will correspond to an amplitude @xmath40 where the heavy - quark kinetic term is properly included .",
    "unfortunately , we can not simultaneously correct for @xmath36 interactions without a more sophisticated approach  i.e . , a modification to the action and the tuning of an additional parameter @xcite .",
    "as the best approximation that we can make within these limitations , we use the shift described by ( [ mshift ] ) in our analysis but include its full effect on the final results as an additional systematic error .",
    "its effect is actually quite small .",
    "for the static limit at , we have used both wall sources @xcite and `` cube '' sources ( see , for example , @xcite ) . the latter",
    "are constructed , also in coulomb gauge , from point - source propagators , and the smearing volume can be adjusted .    in fig .",
    "1 we show the results of the static decay amplitude for various smearing volumes . for each volume , we show in addition the dependence on the fitted time interval of the correlator @xmath11 , while that for @xmath12 has been held fixed .",
    "each analysis consists of a coupled fit ( i.e. , both correlators fit simultaneously , extracting a single ground - state mass ) and includes correlations in the data .",
    "we mark the fits which satisfy @xmath43 with `` @xmath44 . ''",
    "a search for an early plateau in the effective masses , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , or in @xmath47 , can lead to some judgement of the `` best '' smearing volume to use .",
    "however , the following difficulties arise : ( 1 ) the possibility of short - range false plateaus in @xmath48 coupled with a decreasing signal - to - noise ratio at large times ; ( 2 ) the location of the plateaus in @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 may not coincide , making the ratio @xmath47 difficult to interpret unambiguously ; and ( 3 ) a noticeable variation in the optimum volume as the light - quark mass is changed complicates extrapolations to @xmath23 .",
    "1 provides an example where reasonable fits are obtained at early times for three different smearing volumes , namely @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , but where systematic differences are clearly evident in the raw amplitude .",
    "however , the later - time fits for these three smearing sizes are in good agreement , and they show consistency with the wall source results which were extracted using a different method , as discussed below . with these rather crude smearing techniques , and with our level of statistics , we view the safest choice for a quoted result to be a later - time fit where the choice of the `` optimum '' volume is less of an issue , since here we obtain consistent results over a range of smearing sizes , including the wall sources .",
    "similar analysis of the static computations at @xmath52 @xcite gave a considerably smaller value for @xmath6 than initially reported .",
    "note that we do _ not _ expect that the projection onto the ground state will continue to improve as we enlarge the smearing volume .",
    "as we have previously pointed out @xcite , the relative higher - state contamination is expected to increase due to the large extent of the wall source .",
    "however , the wall has an advantage in terms of statistics ( sources for both light and heavy quarks at every point on a timeslice ) , and ultimately its performance must be evaluated empirically .",
    "we have indeed found a two - state fit necessary for the wall sources , indicating a substantial admixture of an excited state .",
    "nonetheless we find good agreement ( both in central value and size of errors ) in the ground - state quantities with the best cube - source results .",
    "since we view a single - state fit as a safer alternative , we have now chosen the @xmath53 source ( presented in table 1 ) for our combined analysis leading to @xmath3 and @xmath4 . due to the limitations of our sources",
    ", we can not rule out a systematic error in the static results of roughly @xmath54 .    in fig 2 ,",
    "we show the results of two analyses combining the static point ( @xmath53 source , single - state fit ) and the conventional data ( wall - source , two - state fit ) , both with and without the large-@xmath2 corrections .",
    "the light quark has been extrapolated to the chiral limit .",
    "the analysis procedure is : ( 1 ) divide the conventional amplitudes by @xmath55 ; ( 2 ) fit to a quadratic in @xmath34 and interpolate to the @xmath1 and @xmath0 masses ; ( 3 ) re - introduce @xmath55 in the interpolated results .",
    "the fit is made using a jackknife estimation of the covariance matrix to account for correlations .",
    "when the @xmath56 normalization is used , we obtain good fits using the heaviest of the conventional data ( @xmath57 for the chiral extrapolation , @xmath58 for the strange ) . if we attempt to fit the same set of points with the `` old '' normalization , or even if we throw out the heaviest points , thereby attempting to avoid large-@xmath2 errors , we obtain much poorer fits .",
    "( the latter option is shown as `` old normalization '' in fig .  2 .",
    "the fit has @xmath59 . )",
    "these data strongly indicate that the @xmath56 normalization is necessary to get agreement between the two methods .",
    "although we can not rigorously bound the systematic error associated with the approximate techniques which we have used , we expect that a rough estimate will be given by the size of the change due to ( [ mshift ] ) , since this directly addresses @xmath34 effects in a region where we expect the heavy quark to behave non - relativistically .",
    "however , since the corrections to the lighter masses are small , and the static point remains unchanged , the difference in the fit with and without ( [ mshift ] ) is minimal , as reflected in the `` @xmath34 '' values in tables 2 and 3 .",
