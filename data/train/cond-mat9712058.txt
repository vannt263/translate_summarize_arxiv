    "silicon is one of the most intensely investigated materials .",
    "interest in silicon is mostly motivated by its great technological importance , but it is also regarded as the prototypical covalent solid , on which theoretical concepts about covalent bonding can be tested , and new ideas can be explored .",
    "the nature of covalent bonding often makes the description of complicated phenomena difficult : the covalent bond can only be described properly by quantum theory , while many interesting phenomena involve large numbers of atoms ( in the range 10@xmath1 - 10@xmath2 ) , which quantum mechanical approaches can not handle @xcite . in this sense , silicon represents an ideal candidate for modeling by an empirical interatomic potential : the development of a potential will at once put to a rigorous test our understanding of the physics of covalent bonding and , if successful , will enable the simulation of important complex processes that involve large number of atoms .",
    "many attempts to construct an empirical model for interatomic interactions in si have already been reported @xcite .",
    "of all these models , the stillinger and weber ( sw ) @xcite and the tersoff @xcite potentials are the most widely used @xcite .",
    "the sw potential consists of two- and three - body terms and was fitted to experimental properties of the diamond cubic ( dc ) and molten phase of silicon @xcite .",
    "it has been used , for example , to study lattice dynamics @xcite , point defects @xcite , surfaces @xcite , and the liquid and amorphous phases @xcite .",
    "the tersoff potential ( its three versions usually referred to as t1 @xcite , t2 @xcite , and t3 @xcite ) consists of many - body interactions included in a bond order term and was fitted to _ ab initio _",
    "results for several si polytypes .",
    "it has been used to study lattice dynamics @xcite , thermomechanical properties @xcite , point defects @xcite , and the liquid and amorphous phases @xcite .",
    "although the sw and tersoff functional forms have enough flexibility to describe a number of different configurations , their transferability to a wide class of structures remains in question .",
    "several models have attempted to improve the description of configurations far from equilibrium and far from the database used to construct the potential , by changing the functional form , using higher order ( up to five - body ) expansion terms , increasing the number of fitting parameters ( up to 36 ) , or expanding the set of fitted structures @xcite . despite the increased complexity",
    ", these models have been able to improve the description of local configurations only selectively , and often at a considerable increase in computational cost .",
    "this suggests that a simple extension to more elaborate functional forms or larger databases does not necessarily provide better description of covalent bonding .",
    "considering the lack of transferability of existing models , it is of interest to develop a model for silicon with the following ingredients : superior description of local structures and computationally efficient evaluations of the energy and interatomic forces .    in this article",
    "we present a new empirical potential for silicon using a theoretically motivated functional form which emphasizes chemical and physical trends @xcite , and which is determined by fitting to a fairly small _ ab initio _ database with only 13 parameters .",
    "this potential represents a considerable improvement over existing models in describing local structures and extended defects .",
    "it provides a good description of point defects in the bulk , the concerted exchange path for self - diffusion , and elastic properties of bulk silicon .",
    "it also predicts core structures of partial dislocations in the glide set \\{111 } in excellent agreement with _",
    "ab initio _ results .",
    "disordered structures and phase transitions are also well - described , particularly the amorphous phase , which is better modeled by dynamical simulations using our potential than by any empirical preparation method .",
    "the article is organized as follows : the functional form is presented in detail in section [ sec : ff ] .",
    "the fitting of the model is discussed in section [ sec : fit ] , along with tests of transferability for bulk crystal structures , defects and activation complexes .",
    "the fitted potential is then used to calculate core properties of physically relevant dislocations in section [ sec : dis ] and the structure of disordered phases in section [ sec : amo ] .",
    "here we describe the functional form of the new potential , which we call the environment dependent interatomic potential ( edip ) for bulk silicon , and refer the reader to the companion paper @xcite for theoretical justification of all the terms .",
    "the energy of a configuration @xmath3 is expressed as a sum over single - atom energies , @xmath4 , each containing two- and three - body terms , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is an interaction between atoms @xmath7 and @xmath8 representing pairwise bonds , and @xmath9 is the interaction between atoms @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath10 centered at atom @xmath7 representing angular forces .",
    "both types of interactions depend on the local environment of atom @xmath7 through its effective coordination number , defined by , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a cutoff function that measures the contribution of neighbor @xmath13 to the coordination of atom @xmath7 in terms of the separation @xmath14 .",
    "the neighbor function , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , is unity for @xmath15 , with a gentle drop from 1 to 0 between @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and is 0 for @xmath18 : @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "a neighbor of atom @xmath7 at a distance @xmath15 is considered a full neighbor , while the neighbors between @xmath16 and @xmath17 give only a partial contribution to @xmath21 .",
    "the cutoffs are constrained to reproduce the coordinations of important crystal structures , _ e. g. _",
    "@xmath22 for the diamond lattice .",
    "the two - body term includes repulsive and attractive interactions , @xmath23 \\exp \\left ( \\frac{\\sigma}{r - a } \\right ) , \\ ] ] which go to zero at the cutoff @xmath24 with all derivatives continuous .",
    "although this choice is quite similar to the sw two - body term ( and indeed reduces to it exactly for small distortions of the diamond lattice ) , the bond strength adapts to changes in the local atomic environment .",
    "the coordination dependence introduces an asymmetry , @xmath25 , similar to the tersoff potential in that the strength of the attractive force is controlled by a bond order function @xmath26 that depends on the local coordination .",
    "this dependence is motivated by theoretical calculations which have demonstrated the weakening of the attractive interaction and the corresponding increase in bond length for increasing coordination @xcite .",
    "these studies reveal a shoulder in the function @xmath26 at the ideal coordination @xmath27 , where the transition from covalent ( @xmath28 ) to metallic ( @xmath29 ) bonding occurs .",
    "this theoretical dependence can be accurately captured by a gaussian function @xcite , @xmath30 figure [ fig2 ] shows the @xmath31 term for several coordinations , compared to the two - body part of the sw potential @xmath32 .",
    "note that the fitted @xmath31 resembles closely the inverted _ ab initio _",
    "pair potentials for silicon crystals with the same coordinations @xcite , a feature built into the function form @xcite .",
    "the three - body term contains radial and angular factors , @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "the radial function is chosen to have the sw form , @xmath35 and goes to zero smoothly at the cutoff distance @xmath17 .",
    "the angular function @xmath36 is strongly dependent on the local coordination through two functions @xmath37 and @xmath38 that control the equilibrium angle and the strength of the interaction , respectively .",
    "theoretical considerations lead us to postulate the following form @xcite : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a generic function satisfying the constraints , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "our specific choice is @xmath45 .\\ ] ] we make the choice @xmath46 to control the strength of angular forces as function of coordination .",
    "the three - body angular function becomes flatter ( and hence angular forces become weaker ) as coordination increases , representing the transition from covalent bonding to metallic bonding .",
    "the angular function @xmath36 has two major contributions .",
    "the first , @xmath47 , is symmetric about the minimum , becoming flat for small angles .",
    "this choice of shape for the angular function was also used by mistriotis , flyntzanis and farantos ( mff ) @xcite , but due to its environment - dependence our angular function is fundamentally different . in a preliminary fitted version of edip , we included only this flat , symmetric term @xcite , but we found that it is not suitable for several structures ( particularly the amorphous phase ) .",
    "indeed , a more asymmetrical angular function is suggested by approximations of quantum - mechanical ( tight - binding ) models @xcite and exact inversions of _ ab initio _ cohesive energy curves @xcite , so the present form of edip also contains a second term , @xmath48 ( identical in shape to the sw form but containing environment - dependence ) , which gives a stronger interaction for small angles .    the function @xmath49 controls the equilibrium angle @xmath50 of the three - body interaction as a function of coordination .",
    "this feature of the potential makes it possible to model the proper hybridization of atoms in different environments @xcite : if a silicon atom is three- or four - fold coordinated , it will prefer to form @xmath51 or @xmath52 hybrid bonds with equilibrium angles @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively . for coordinations 2 and 6",
    ", we take @xmath55 or @xmath56 . for two - fold coordination",
    ", this choice describes the preference for bonding along two orthogonal @xmath57-states with the low - energy nonbonding @xmath58 state fully occupied . for six - fold coordination ,",
    "the choice @xmath59 reflects the @xmath57 character of the bonds ( which are also metallic , as discussed below ) .",
    "we construct @xmath60 to interpolate smoothly between the special points ( @xmath61 ) with the following form , @xmath62 with the parameters chosen as @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 , resulting in the curve shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2a ] , which is consistent with the results of quantum - mechanical approximations @xcite .",
    "note that these parameters are theoretically determined and are not allowed to vary in the fitting described in the next section .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the three - body term @xmath67 for three atoms at a distance @xmath68  , and for different coordinations .",
    "we also compare the three - body term to the sw three - body potential @xmath69 .",
    "the sw angular form @xmath70 penalizes the configurations with angles smaller than @xmath71 with a large positive contribution . in contrast , the angular function of our model potential gives a considerably weaker interaction at small angles .    in summary , this implementation of edip for bulk silicon has 13 adjustable parameters : @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath17 , @xmath16 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "it also has continuous first and second derivatives with respect to the atomic position vectors .",
    "the functional form already contains considerable information about chemical bonding in bulk silicon taken directly from theoretical studies , mostly of ideal crystal structures .",
    "the ( relatively few ) adjustable parameters provide the necessary freedom to extrapolate these bonding dependences for defect structures strictly outside the theoretical input , as described below .",
    "we close this section by addressing the crucial issue of computational efficiency ( which motivates the use of empirical methods in the first place ) .",
    "the environment terms in the two- and three - body iterations require extra loops in the force calculation . in the case of the three - body interaction",
    ", it requires a four - body loop , that would make a force evaluation more expensive than with the sw potential .",
    "however , the four - body loop needs to be performed only for those neighbors @xmath83 of atom @xmath7 in which @xmath84 .",
    "this happens only when atoms are in the range @xmath85 , i.e. only for a small number of the neighbors .",
    "therefore , one force evaluation using our model is approximately as efficient as one using the sw potential , showing that increased sophistication and realism can be achieved with insignificant computational overhead .",
    "in fact , since the fitted cutoff distance ( given in the next section ) is smaller than the corresponding sw cutoff , computing forces with our model is typically faster than with the sw potential . for example , in liquid phase simulations on a silicon graphics r-10000 processor it takes 30 @xmath81sec / atom to evaluate forces using edip , compared with 50 @xmath81sec / atom using the sw potential .",
    "in order to determine the values of the adjustable parameters , we fit to a database that includes _ ab initio _ results @xcite , based on density functional theory in the local density approximation ( dft / lda ) , for bulk properties ( cohesive energy and lattice constant of the dc structure ) , selected values along the unrelaxed concerted exchange ( ce ) path @xcite for self - diffusion , some formation energies of unrelaxed point defects ( vacancy and interstitial at the tetrahedral and hexagonal configurations ) @xcite , a few key values in the generalized stacking fault ( gsf ) energy surface @xcite , and the experimental elastic constants @xcite .",
    "this rich set of configurations contains many of the important local structures found in condensed phases and bulk defects and thus improves the transferability of the model .",
    "the database does not include other high symmetry configurations , such as sc , bcc or fcc ( as many of the existing empirical potentials have done ) , although the dc structure is required to be the lowest in energy .",
    "these hypothetical metallic structures have large enough energies compared to covalent ones to be considered irrelevant",
    ". incidentally , fitting the model simultaneously to such a wide set of configurations and properties represents a considerable computational challenge .",
    "the fitting is accomplished using a least - squares approach , with each configuration in the database weighted appropriately .",
    "all parameter values are allowed to vary at once through a simulated annealing process .",
    "theoretical estimates of the parameters were also used to restrict the range of parameter - space that needed to be explored @xcite .",
    "table [ tab1 ] provides the best set of parameters we obtained .",
    "the calculated energies and properties of several bulk structures as obtained from our potential and from _ ab initio _ and other empirical potential calculations are given in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "this compilation of results includes the dc structure which is the ground state of si , and several other high - coordination bulk structures .",
    "although the latter structures were not included in the fitting database , our model provides a reasonable description of their energies and a good description of equilibrium lattice constants .",
    "structures such as @xmath75-tin and bct5@xcite are also of interest because they have low - energy and relatively low - coordination ( 5 for bct5 and 6 for @xmath75-tin ) @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the dc phase transforms into the @xmath75-tin structure under pressure . for the @xmath75-tin structure ,",
    "our model predicts a cohesive energy per atom higher than that of dc by @xmath86 ev , and a lattice parameter @xmath87  , as compared to _ ab initio _ results of 0.21 ev and 4.73  respectively . for the bct5 structure ,",
    "our model predicts @xmath88 ev and @xmath89  , as compared to _ ab initio _ results of 0.23 ev and 3.32  , respectively .",
    "most existing empirical potentials give a poor ( or marginally acceptable ) description of elastic properties of the dc crystal , which directly affects the description of the crystal deformation . in the fitting database we included the three independent elastic constants",
    "@xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 from experiment .",
    "table [ tab3 ] compares elastic constants , obtained with the homogeneous deformation method @xcite , as given by our model with the results from other empirical potentials and with experimental results .",
    "the shear constant @xmath92 is particularly important for the description of long range interactions @xcite .",
    "although @xmath92 is underestimated by most empirical models , ours is reasonably close to the experimental value .",
    "our potential also almost perfectly reproduces the _ ab initio _ value of the shear modulus @xmath93 without internal relaxation@xcite , as anticipated by theory @xcite .",
    "table [ tab3 ] also includes other elastic properties , such as the second shear constant , @xmath94 , and the cauchy discrepancy , @xmath95 , both important for determining crystal stability @xcite . by predicting a negative cauchy discrepancy ,",
    "our potential offers a qualitative improvement over most other existing potentials @xcite and several tight - binding ( tb ) models @xcite which give positive values .",
    "it also provides a quantitative improvement over other tb models that get the correct sign of @xmath96 @xcite . in summary ,",
    "our potential gives elastic constants in excellent agreement with experimental and _ ab initio _ results . as we have shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , accurate elastic behavior is not simply the result of good fitting , but is rather a built - in feature of our functional form .",
    "point defects in the dc crystal involve large atomic relaxations and rebonding , thus representing the first test for the transferability of our model in describing local structures away from equilibrium .",

    "the relaxed structures are computed using an energy minimization conjugate - gradient method @xcite .",
    "although the sw and tersoff potentials give a reasonable description of relaxed structures , they clearly fail in describing the energy released upon relaxation . in our model , on the other hand , the relaxation energies are much lower and in reasonably good agreement with _",
    "ab initio _ calculations .",
    "we emphasize that none of the relaxation energies or structures were used in the fitting database .",
    "the @xmath99 split interstitial ( the lowest energy interstitial configuration ) is well described by our model , in spite of also not being included in the fitting .",
    "the formation energy for the relaxed structure of the @xmath99 split interstitial is 3.35 ev in our model , compared to 3.30 ev from _ ab initio _",

    "the results using our model agree reasonably well with those from dft / lda calculations , and are considerably better than those using the sw or tersoff potentials .",
    "the activation energy for ce ( an important quantity that enters in the calculation of diffusion rates ) obtained from our model is 5.41 ev , compared to 5.47 ev from _ ab initio _ calculations , 7.90 ev from the sw potential , and 6.50 ev from the tersoff potential .",
    "the energy of the relaxed structure , which was not included in the fitting database , is 4.82 ev using our model , in good agreement with the _ ab initio _ result of 4.60 ev .",
    "the fitting database also included selected unrelaxed configurations of the generalized stacking fault ( gsf ) energies .",
    "we considered three points for the the glide set and three for the shuffle set @xcite of the \\{111 } glide plane . table [ tab4a ] shows the unstable stacking fault energy for the unrelaxed glide and shuffle @xmath100 planes as obtained from calculations using dft / lda @xcite , sw , and the present interatomic potential .",
    "our model gives good agreement with dft / lda calculations for the @xmath101 glide set , but underestimates the energy for the @xmath99 glide set . since our potential is short - ranged , it gives zero energy for the stable stacking fault , while the experimental value is 0.006 ev / @xmath102 .",
    "the sw and tersoff models , which are also short - ranged , give the same zero energy for the stable stacking fault .",
    "the tb model @xcite , on the other hand , gives 0.005 ev / @xmath102 , in agreement with dft / lda results .",
    "nevertheless , given that the accuracy of empirical models is rarely better than a few tenths of an ev per atom , our vanishing stable stacking fault energy is not particularly problematic .",
    "in summary , our potential provides an excellent description of configurations near equilibrium as well as a wide range of point defects in the dc structure .",
    "although a number of these properties were explicitly fit , the superior description has been achieved with a small number of adjustable parameters that is greatly exceeded by the number of degrees of freedom inherent in these configurations .",
    "thus , we suggest that it is our physically appropriate functional form rather than a flexible fitting strategy that has led to the improved description , a conclusion that is further supported by our results for extended defects and disordered phases discussed next .",
    "a stringent test of the transferability of our model to local structures is obtained by calculating core properties of dislocations , about which no information was included in the fitting database .",
    "ab initio _ @xcite and tight - binding calculations @xcite have been performed for dislocations in silicon .",
    "although such calculations are feasible only for small systems containing of order few hundred atoms , they provide important information , such as the core structure of the 90@xmath0-partial dislocation @xcite , the kink structure in the 30@xmath0-partial dislocation @xcite , and dislocation interactions @xcite . however , full simulations of dislocation dynamics and its effect on the mechanical properties of the solid require much larger cells owing to the long range interaction of the stress fields , and therefore can only be performed using methods that are computationally less expensive .",
    "empirical models have been used to study several aspects of dislocations in silicon @xcite .",
    "no such model has proven reliable enough to provide a description of long range @xcite as well as core properties @xcite of dislocations at the same time .",
    "the flaw in describing long range interactions is due to a poor description of elastic forces @xcite , while the flaw in describing core properties is due to a poor description of local structures @xcite .",
    "existing models do not give the correct structure for reconstructed cores : for example , the sw potential gives reconstruction only for the 30@xmath0-partial dislocation , and the tersoff potential gives reconstruction only for the 90@xmath0-partial .",

    "the melting point was measured for a finite sample with @xmath119 surfaces , heated from 300 k to 1500 k in 2 ns ( over 10 million time steps ) . a bulk solid with periodic boundary conditions superheats and melts around 2200 k. the latent heat of melting is 37.8 kj / mol , in reasonable agrement with the experimental value of 50.7 kj / mol , closer than the sw value of 31.4 kj / mol @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "although the liquid has some unphysical features with our potential , it offers some improvements , particularly in describing bond angles .",
    "it is important to emphasize that reasonable liquid properties are predicted by our model without any explicit fitting to the liquid phase ; in contrast , the only two potentials reported to give an adequate description of the liquid , sw and mff , were each fit to reproduce the melting point @xcite . with our model , the reduced density and excess of covalent bonds may be artifacts of the short cutoff of our potential , which is appropriate for the covalently - bonded structures used in the fitting , but is perhaps too short to reproduce overcoordination in metallic phases like the liquid@xcite .",
    "_ amorphous phase .",
    "_ experimentally , amorphous silicon is known to form a random tetrahedral network , with long - range disorder and short - range order similar to that of the crystal @xcite . _",
    "ab initio _ molecular dynamics simulations of quenching a 64-atom liquid predict almost 97% four - fold coordination @xcite .",
    "an empirical potential would be invaluable in exploring larger system sizes and longer relaxation times than are feasible from first principles , but unfortunately no existing potential is capable of quenching directly from the liquid to the amorphous phase . instead , empirical model liquids typically transform into glassy phases upon cooling , characterized by frozen - in liquid structure @xcite .",
    "alternatively , in the case of the t2 potential , quenching results in a reasonable amorphous structure @xcite , but the original liquid phase is not realistic and already contains excessive tetraherdal order @xcite .",
    "therefore , it has been impossible to simulate an experimentally relevant path to the amorphous structure ( _ e.g. _ laser quenching @xcite ) , and artificial preparation methods have been required to create large - scale amorphous structures with empirical potentials @xcite .",
    "for example , the so - called indirect sw amorphous ( isw ) structure is created by increasing the strength of the sw three - body interaction during the quench @xcite .",
    "the isw structure is stable with the unaltered sw potential , but since it has 81% four - fold coordinated atoms @xcite , it only bears a weak resemblance to the real amorphous structure @xcite . abandoning molecular dynamics ,",
    "an improved amorphous phase with close to 87% four - fold coordination can be generated using the bond - switching algorithm of wooten , winer and weaire @xcite , but such a method does not permit accurate simulation of atomic motion .",
    "a more realistic , large - scale amorphous structure can be prepared using a hybrid of these methods : holender and morgan create an amorphous structure of over @xmath120 atoms with almost 94% four - fold coordination by patching together a number of smaller www structures , thermally treating the sample at high temperatures and then relaxing it using molecular dynamics with the sw potential modified for stronger angular forces @xcite . as these authors emphasize , however , this preparation method ( which we call the hm2 model ) was designed by trial - and - error to fit the experimental structure factor and bears no resemblance to the real experimental generation of a - si .",
    "they also report that if the sw potential is not modified , their preparation method results in a structure ( which we call the hm1 model ) with only 74% four - fold coordination .",
    "remarkably , the present model predicts a quench directly from the liquid into a high - quality amorphous structure .",
    "the phase transition is quite robust , since it occurs even with fast cooling rates .",
    "for example , quenching at -300 k / ps leads to a reasonable structure with 84% four - fold coordination . at much slower quench rates of -1",
    "k / ps , an improved structure of 1728 atoms at @xmath121 k and zero pressure is produced with almost 95% four - fold coordination .",
    "the excess enthalpy of the amorphous phase compared with the crystal is 0.22 ev / atom , closer to experimental values @xmath122 ev / atom @xcite than the _ ab initio _ value 0.28 ev / atom ( probably due to the constrained volume and small system size used in the _ ab initio _ study @xcite ) .",
    "the coordination statistics of the amorphous phase obtained with our model , given in table [ tabamo ] , are closer to _ ab initio _ results @xcite than with most of the empirical models described above .",
    "the hm2 model provides a comparable description , but we stress that its preparation procedure is unphysical and that the modification of the sw potential necessary to achieve the improved description ( see the difference between hm1 and hm2 in table [ tabamo ] ) degrades many important properties , such as elastic constants , defect formation energies and the melting point .",
    "since realistic preparation methods and dynamics have not been achieved with interatomic potentials , in the following we compare our results only with experiments and _ ab initio _ simulations .",
    "the pair correlation function shown in fig .",
    "[ figamo ] ( a ) is in good agreement with _ ab initio _",
    "results @xcite .",
    "moreover , fig .",
    "[ figamoexpt ] shows that the radial distribution function @xmath123 is in excellent agreement with the results of neutron scattering experiments by kugler _ et .",
    "@xcite ( using their experimental density @xmath124 atoms / @xmath1 for comparison ) .",
    "the persistence of intermediate - range order up to 10 captured by our model as in experiment is a strength of the empirical approach , since this distance is roughly the size of the periodic simulation box used in the _ ab initio _",
    "studies @xcite .",
    "given the limited resolution of the experimental data , especially at small @xmath125 ( large @xmath126 in the structure factor ) , the sharper first three peaks with our model may be interpreted as refinements of the experimental results . in table",
    "[ tabamoexpt ] we summarize a detailed comparison of features of a - si as obtained with our model and from ab - initio results , against those revealed by experiment .",
    "overall the agreement between experiment is very satisfactory , with the results of the present model somewhat closer to experimental values than _ ab initio _ results as in the case of the enthalpy ( @xmath127 ) and the bond - length ( @xmath128 ) and bond - angle ( @xmath129 ) deviations .",
    "the bond angle distribution @xmath114 shown in fig .",
    "[ figamo ] ( b ) is narrowly peaked just below the tetrahedral angle , and also reproduces the small , well - separated peak at 60@xmath0 observed in _ ab initio _",
    "simulations @xcite ( unlike in previous empirical models ) .",
    "the average angle is 108.7@xmath0 and standard deviation 13.6@xmath0 in close agreement with the experimental values@xcite of 108.6 @xmath130 and 10.2 @xmath131 and _ ab initio _ values@xcite of 108.3@xmath0 and 15.5@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "notice that the peaks in both @xmath111 and @xmath114 are narrower and taller with our model than with _ ab initio _ methods , which probably reflects the small system size and short times of the _ ab initio _",
    "simulations compared to ours . in summary , our potential reproduces the random tetrahedral network of amorphous silicon very well , following a realistic preparation procedure that starts with a liquid phase and cools it down without any artificial changes .",
    "we have developed a new empirical potential for silicon that provides a considerable improvement over existing models in describing local structures away from equilibrium .",
    "the model introduces a theoretically motivated functional form that incorporates several coordination dependent functions to adapt the interactions for different coordinations .",
    "the fitted potential faithfully reproduces the elastic constants of the equilibrium dc structure and also captures the energetics of a wide range of point and extended defects and related activation energies .",
    "the superior description of bulk phases and defects is achieved with only thirteen fitting parameters , indicating exceptional transferability of the edip functional form .",
    "its extended range of success over existing models with comparable numbers of parameters can not be attributed to fitting alone .    for dislocations ,",
    "this is the first empirical model to give a full description of core properties .",
    "it predicts the correct reconstruction for both the @xmath71- and @xmath110-partial dislocations , and the reconstruction energies are in agreement with _",
    "ab initio _ data .",
    "the bond stretching is also in good agreement with _ ab initio _ results , pointing to the fact that this model predicts reasonably accurately not only the energies but also the local structure of dislocation cores .",
    "this is the also the first empirical model to predict a quench directly from the liquid to the amorphous phase .",
    "the quality of the resulting amorphous phase , with almost 95% four - fold coordination , is better than with any existing empirical preparation method . in some ways",
    "the amorphous phase with our model is even somewhat closer to experiment than with _ ab initio _",
    "simulations ( surely because the latter are limited to very small system sizes and very short times ) , which is an encouraging success of the empirical approach to materials modeling .",
    "our model possesses the same level of efficiency as the sw potential , and simulations involving thousands of atoms may be readily performed on typical workstations .",
    "therefore , it holds promise for successful applications to several systems that are still inaccessible to _ ab initio _ calculations and are outside the range of validity of other empirical models . taking into account the success of our model in describing dislocation properties , we suggest that it may also provide a reasonable description of small - angle grain boundaries and other such extended bulk defects . considering its success with the amorphous and crystalline phases , the model may also describe the a - c interface and solid - phase epitaxial growth .",
