    "the notion of spacings , which for one dimensional data are just the differences between two consecutive order statistics , have been extensively studied in the one dimensional setting ; see , e.g. , the review papers @xcite . many important applications to testing and estimation problems have been derived from the study of the asymptotic behaviour of the spacings .",
    "applications to testing problems date back to @xcite , who address the asymptotic theory of a class of tests for increasing failure rate . for estimation problems ,",
    "@xcite propose the maximum spacing estimation method to estimate the parameters of a univariate statistical model .    in the multidimensional case ,",
    "several different notions of maximal - spacing have been proposed .",

    "in contrast , this is the case with the different and global notion proposed in @xcite , and generalized in @xcite .    in @xcite ,",

    "the notion of maximal multivariate spacing , and in particular janson s result , has been used to solve different statistical problems . in set estimation ( see , for instance , @xcite and @xcite ) , it is used to prove the optimality of the rates of convergence . + the aim of this paper is to extend janson s result to hlder continuous densities , and develop , using that extension , a test to decide whether the support is convex or not .",
    "it is organized as follows : section @xmath7 is devoted to the extension of janson s results . a new definition ( which includes janson s as a particular case ) is given and the associated theoretical results are presented . the proofs of these results are given in appendix a. section @xmath8",
    "is dedicated to the problem of testing the convexity of the support .",
    "the corresponding proofs are given in appendix b. just to mention some application of this test , let us recall that when dealing with support estimation , if the support is known to be convex , the convex hull of the observations provides a consistent and well studied ( see for instance @xcite,@xcite and @xcite ) estimator of @xmath5 which does not require any smoothing parameter . also , a convexity test can be used to , a posteriori , select a tuning parameter . in @xcite a test for convexity is also proposed , and applied to choose the parameter of the isomap ( see @xcite ) method for dimensionality reduction . the convexity test based on janson s extension",
