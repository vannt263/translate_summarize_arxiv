    "matter containing a large number of strange quarks may have a lower energy per baryon than ordinary nuclei and be absolutely stable@xcite .",
    "this intriguing possibility has generated a great deal of interest across many subfields of physics .",
    "a crucial implicit assumption for the stability of this new kind of matter , called strange matter , is that the baryon number @xmath3 is exactly conserved .",
    "of course , we know nuclei are stable against @xmath4 decays .",
    "the best mode - independent experimental lower limit to date is @xmath5 years@xcite .",
    "however , there may be effective @xmath4 interactions which are highly suppressed for nuclei but not for strange matter .",
    "we examine such a hypothesis here and show that whereas such exotic decays are possible , the relevant lifetime should be longer than @xmath2 years .    in sec .  2 we review briefly the present experimental constraints on @xmath4 interactions",
    "these come mainly from the nonobservation of proton decay and of neutron - antineutron oscillation .",
    "we then point out the possible consequences of an effective @xmath6 , @xmath7 operator ( where @xmath8 denotes the number of @xmath9 quarks ) on the stability of strange matter .",
    "we proceed to discuss some possible theoretical origins of such an operator in sec .  3 and sec .  4 .",
    "we deal first with the supersymmetric standard model with @xmath10-parity nonconserving terms of the form @xmath0 and show that their effects are negligible .",
    "we then discuss two possible extended models where the effects may be large . in sec .",
    "5 we consider this operator in conjunction with the usual weak interaction and show that the suppression coming from the stability of ordinary nuclei translates to a phenomenological lower limit of @xmath2 years on the lifetime of strange matter . finally in sec .",
    "6 , there are some concluding remarks .",
    "given the standard @xmath11 gauge symmetry and the usual quarks and leptons , it is well - known that the resulting renormalizable lagrangian conserves both the baryon number @xmath3 and the lepton number @xmath12 automatically .",
    "however , new physics at higher energy scales may induce effective interactions ( of dimension 5 or above ) which do not respect these conservation laws .",
    "the foremost example is the possibility of proton decay . for this to happen",
    ", there has to be at least one fermion with a mass below that of the proton .",
    "since only leptons are known to have this property , the selection rule @xmath13 , @xmath14 is applicable .",
    "the most studied decay mode experimentally is @xmath15 , which requires the effective interaction @xmath16 it is now known@xcite that @xmath17 years , hence @xmath18 gev . [ here @xmath19 should be considered an effective mass , because in some scenarios the denominator of the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( 1 ) is really the product of two different masses . ]",
    "this means that proton decay probes physics at the grand - unification energy scale .",
    "the next simplest class of effective interactions has the selection rule @xmath6 , @xmath20 .",
    "the most well - known example is of course @xmath21 which induces neutron - antineutron oscillation and allows a nucleus to decay by the annihilation of two of its nucleons .",
    "note that since 6 fermions are now involved , the effective operator is of dimension 9 , hence @xmath19 appears to the power @xmath22 .",
    "this means that for the same level of nuclear stability , the lower bound on @xmath19 will be only of order @xmath2 gev .",
    "the present best experimental lower limit on the @xmath23 oscillation lifetime is@xcite @xmath24s .",
    "direct search for @xmath25 decay in iron yields@xcite a limit of @xmath26y .",
    "although the above two numbers differ by 30 orders of magnitude , it is well established by general arguments as well as detailed nuclear model calculations that@xcite @xmath27 hence the two limits are comparable .",
    "to estimate the magnitude of @xmath19 , we use @xmath28 where the effective wavefunction at the origin is roughly given by@xcite @xmath29 hence we obtain @xmath30 gev . bearing in mind that @xmath31 is likely to be suppressed also by products of couplings less than unity , this means that the stability of nuclei is sensitive to new physics at an energy scale not too far above the electroweak scale of @xmath32 gev . it may thus have the hope of future direct experimental exploration .    consider next the effective interaction @xmath33 this has the selection rule @xmath6 , @xmath34 . in this case , a nucleus may decay by the process @xmath35@xcite .",
    "although such decay modes have never been observed , the mode - independent stability lifetime of @xmath5y mentioned already is enough to guarantee that it is very small .",
    "however , consider now @xmath36 which has the selection rule @xmath37 to get rid of four units of strangeness , the nucleus must now convert two nucleons into four kaons , but that is kinematically impossible .",
    "hence the severe constraint from the stability of nuclei does not seem to apply here , and the following interesting possibility may occur .    strangelets ( _ i.e. _ stable and metastable configurations of quarks with large strangeness content ) with atomic number @xmath38 ( which is of course the same as baryon number @xmath3 ) and number of strange quarks @xmath8 may now decay into other strangelets with two less units of @xmath38 and one to three less @xmath9 quarks . for example",
    ", @xmath39 for the states of lowest energy , model calculations show@xcite that @xmath40 , hence the above decay modes are efficient ways of reducing all would - be stable strangelets to those of the smallest @xmath38 .    unlike nuclei which are most stable for @xmath38 near that of iron , the energy per baryon number of strangelets decreases with increasing @xmath38",
    "this has led to the intriguing speculation that there are stable macroscopic lumps of strange matter in the universe . on the other hand , it is not clear how such matter would form , because there are no stable building blocks such as hydrogen and helium which are essential for the formation of heavy nuclei . in any case , the above exotic interaction would allow strange matter to dissipate into smaller and smaller units , until @xmath38 becomes too small for the strangelet itself to be stable . a sample calculation by madsen@xcite shows that @xmath41 assuming @xmath42 mev , and the bag factor @xmath43 mev .",
    "hence the @xmath44 and @xmath45 decays would continue until the ground - state mass @xmath46 exceeds the condition that the energy per baryon number is less than 930 mev , which happens at around @xmath47 .",
    "if the standard model of quarks and leptons is extended to include supersymmetry , the @xmath4 terms @xmath0 are allowed in the superpotential . in the above notation , all chiral superfields are assumed to be left - handed , hence @xmath48 denotes the left - handed charge - conjugated quark , or equivalently the right - handed quark , and the subscripts refer to families , _ i.e. _ @xmath49 for @xmath50 and @xmath51 for @xmath52 .",
    "since all quarks are color triplets and the interaction must be a singlet which is antisymmetric in color , the two @xmath53 quark superfields must belong to different families . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ,",
    "these terms are forbidden by the imposition of @xmath10-parity . however , this assumption is not mandatory and there is a vast body of recent literature exploring the consequences of @xmath10-parity nonconservation@xcite .    starting with yukawa terms of the form @xmath0 , where two of the fields are quarks and the third is a scalar quark , we can obtain the effective interaction of eq .",
    "( 7 ) in several ways@xcite . in ref .  [",
    "10 ] the @xmath54 box diagram ( where @xmath55 denotes the supersymmetric scalar partner of @xmath56 ) is considered to obtain the effective interaction of eq .",
    "( 2 ) for @xmath23 oscillation using @xmath57 . here",
    "we take @xmath58 and use @xmath59 instead .",
    "the box diagram involves the exchange of the @xmath60 quarks , the @xmath61 boson , and their supersymmetric partners . since only gauge couplings appear , the glashow - iliopoulos - maiani ( gim ) mechanism@xcite is operative and this diagram vanishes if the @xmath62 scalar quarks have the same mass and that the @xmath60 quark masses can be neglected .",
    "thus in fig .  3 of ref .",
    "[ 10 ] , there is a peak at @xmath63 gev .",
    "however , there are actually two scalar quarks @xmath64 for each quark @xmath56 .",
    "consider just @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the @xmath67 mass matrix is given by @xmath68.\\ ] ] since only @xmath69 couples to @xmath70 through the gauge fermion @xmath71 and @xmath69 is not a mass eigenstate , its approximate effective contribution is given by @xmath72 unless this somehow cancels the @xmath73 and @xmath74 contributions accidentally , the box diagram will not vanish .",
    "furthermore , it is often assumed that the soft supersymmetry - breaking terms @xmath75 and @xmath76 are universal , in which case this amplitude would be zero if the @xmath60 quark masses were neglected . rewriting eq .",
    "( 7 ) more specifically as @xmath77 where the color indices and chiralities of the quarks are noted , the contribution of eq .  ( 12 ) is then given by@xcite @xmath78 where we have assumed universal soft supersymmetry - breaking scalar masses , @xmath79 is the quark - mixing entry for @xmath65 to @xmath9 through the @xmath61 boson , and @xmath80 with the function @xmath81 given by@xcite @xmath82 using the correspondence of @xmath23 oscillation to @xmath83 annihilation inside a nucleus , we estimate the lifetime of strangelets from the above effective interaction assuming @xmath84 gev , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 gev , to be @xmath87 this tells us that such contributions are negligible from the supersymmetric standard model .",
    "recently , another contribution to eq .",
    "( 2 ) has been identified@xcite involving @xmath88 and @xmath89 without the gim suppression of eq .  ( 16 ) .",
    "the form of its contribution to eq .",
    "( 7 ) is @xmath90 which is not the same as eq .",
    "the important coupling is now @xmath91 , but @xmath92",
    "is also suppressed relative to @xmath93 by @xmath94 , hence this contribution to eq .",
    "( 7 ) is even more negligible .",
    "although the supersymmetric standard model can not have a sizable contribution to the @xmath6 , @xmath7 operator of eq .",
    "( 7 ) , an extended model including additional particles belonging to the fundamental * 27 * representation of @xmath95 , inspired by superstring theory@xcite , may do better . consider a slight variation of the model of exotic baryon - number nonconservation proposed some years ago@xcite .",
    "in addition to the usual quark and lepton superfields @xmath96 @xmath97 we have @xmath98 @xmath99 each transforming under the standard @xmath11 gauge group as indicated . imposing the discrete symmetry @xmath100 under which @xmath101 we get the allowed terms @xmath102 in the superpotential , but not @xmath103 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath104 does not develop a vacuum expectation value , so that @xmath3 is broken explicitly by the above @xmath105 term only .",
    "[ note that without this last term , we can assign @xmath106 to @xmath107 respectively and @xmath3 would be conserved . ]",
    "this model allows us to obtain an effective @xmath108 operator without going through a loop , as shown in fig .  1 .    using the formalism of ref .  [ 10 ] for the process @xmath109 we estimate the lifetime to be @xmath110^{10 } \\sim 1.2 \\times 10^{-28 } \\left [ { m \\over \\tilde \\lambda }   \\right]^{10 } { \\rm y},\\ ] ] where @xmath111 gev",
    ", @xmath112 @xmath113 is the nuclear density , and @xmath114 gev is the effective interaction energy scale corresponding to eq .",
    "if we assume @xmath115 tev , then @xmath116 in the above , we have assumed that @xmath117 is unconstrained phenomenologically .",
    "however , consider the term @xmath118 where @xmath119 and @xmath120 so that @xmath121 . hence from this term alone , @xmath122 .",
    "since @xmath123 may now combine with @xmath124 to induce @xmath125 decays , its magnitude is seriously suppressed and @xmath117 would be too small for eq .",
    "( 31 ) to be valid .",
    "however , there is also a third generation , allowing us the @xmath126 term which may then be fine - tuned to eliminate the @xmath123 component , thus saving eq .",
    "this is of course not a very natural solution , but can not otherwise be ruled out .",
    "we may also consider the following tailor - made extension .",
    "let there be a new exotic scalar multiplet @xmath127 with @xmath128 and a new exotic fermion multiplet @xmath129 with @xmath130 .",
    "assume the existence of yukawa terms @xmath131 , @xmath132 , and the @xmath3-nonconserving majorana mass term @xmath133 , then an effective @xmath108 term is possible , as shown in fig .  2 .",
    "note that the @xmath134 combination is now a color octet .",
    "this may in fact be a more efficient way to dissipate strange matter which is presumably not clumped into color - singlet constituents as in ordinary nuclei .",
    "since @xmath135 depends on @xmath136 to the power 10 in eq .",
    "( 30 ) , it appears that a much shorter lifetime than that of eq .",
    "( 31 ) is theoretically possible .",
    "however , there is a crucial phenomenological constraint which we have yet to consider .",
    "although two nucleons can not annihilate inside a nucleus to produce four kaons , they can make three kaons plus a pion .",
    "the effective @xmath108 operator must now be supplemented by a weak transition @xmath137 .",
    "we can compare the effect of this on @xmath138 versus that of the @xmath139 operator on @xmath125 discussed in ref .",
    "first let us look at the phase - space difference .",
    "consider a nucleus with atomic number @xmath38 decaying into one with atomic number @xmath140 plus two kaons with energy - momentum conservation given by @xmath141 .",
    "the decay rate is proportional to @xmath142 where @xmath143 , @xmath144^{1/2}$ ] , and @xmath145 .",
    "consider next @xmath146 with @xmath147 .",
    "because of the limited phase space , we assume the kaons to be nonrelativistic .",
    "hence @xmath148 where @xmath149 ^ 2 - m_\\pi^2 \\}^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "the above integral can be evaluated by treating @xmath150 as cartesian coordinates and then convert them to three - dimensional polar coordinates .",
    "the angular integration over the @xmath151 octant yields a factor of @xmath152 and we get @xmath153 where @xmath154^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "the effective interaction here also differs from that of eq .",
    "( 32 ) by the appearance of a third kaon and an extra pion which can be thought of as having been converted by the weak interaction from a fourth kaon .",
    "we thus estimate the suppression factor to be @xmath155 ^ 2   { f_2 \\over f_1 } \\sim 10^{-20},\\ ] ] where @xmath156 mev , and @xmath157 mev@xmath158 is obtained using the symmetric soft - pion reduction@xcite of the experimental @xmath159 amplitude .",
    "we have again invoked the effective interaction energy scale @xmath160 gev used in eq .",
    "obviously , our estimate depends very sensitively on this parameter , but that is not untypical of many calculations in nuclear physics . since the stability of nuclei is at least @xmath5 years , the reduction by @xmath161 of the above yields @xmath162 for the lifetime of strangelets against @xmath6 , @xmath7 decays .",
    "we have pointed out in this paper that an effective @xmath108 interaction may cause stable strange matter to decay , but the lifetime is constrained phenomenologically by the stability of nuclei against decays of the type @xmath146 and we estimate it to have a lower limit of @xmath2 years .",
    "this result has no bearing on whether stable or metastable strangelets can be created and observed in the laboratory , but may be important for understanding whether there is stable strange bulk matter left in the universe after the big bang and how it should be searched for .",
    "for example , instead of the usual radioactivity of unstable nuclei , strange matter may be long - lived kaon and pion emitters .",
    "the propagation of these kaons and pions through the matter itself and their interactions within such an environment are further areas of possible study .",
    "since energy is released in each such decay , although the amount is rather small , it may be sufficient to cause a chain reaction and break up the bulk matter in a cosmological time scale .",
    "furthermore , if the particles mediating this effective interaction have masses of order 1 tev as discussed , then forthcoming future high - energy accelerators such as the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at the european center for nuclear research ( cern ) will have a chance of confirming or refuting their existence .",
