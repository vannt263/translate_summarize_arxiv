    "topological quantum computation ( tqc ) is expected to be physically realized on quantum systems in _",
    "topological phases_. for example , the quasi - particle excitations in fractional quantum hall liquids are conjectured to exhibit the topological behavior necessary to support tqc . a definition of topological phase is found in @xcite : `` _ _ ... a system is in a topological phase if its low - energy effective field theory is a topological quantum field theory ( tqft ) _ _ '' .",
    "thus all observable properties of topological phases should be expressible in terms of the structure of the corresponding tqft .",
    "on the other hand , it is known @xcite that _ modular categories _ faithfully encode ( 3d ) tqfts in algebraic terms .",
    "these relationships between modular categories , tqft , topological phases and topological quantum computers are illustrated in figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "the solid arrows represent well - established or ( tautological ) one - to - one correspondences , while the dashed arrows represent theoretical expectations .",
    "while the algebraic axioms defining modular categories may seem quite distant from condensed matter physics and quantum computation , certain natural statistics in modular categories appear to correspond to important computational properties in tqc .",
    "most significantly , the images of the braid group representations associated to a modular category are intimately related to the computational power of the corresponding tqc .",
    "we illustrate this with two well - known examples :    consider the ( unitary ) modular category @xmath0 obtained as a subquotient of the representation category of the quantum group @xmath1 with @xmath2 ( associated with the @xmath3-chern - simons - witten tqft at level @xmath4 ) .",
    "we note the following :    1 .",
    "the images of the associated braid group representations are as large as possible , i.e. _ dense _ in the group of special unitaries @xcite .",
    "a topological quantum computer realized upon a physical system algebraically modeled by @xmath0 is _",
    "universal_. 3 .",
    "the associated link invariant is @xmath5 the jones polynomial evaluated at @xmath6 , which has computational complexity @xmath7-hard @xcite .",
    "moreover , approximate computation of the jones polynomial at a @xmath8th root of unity is known to be @xmath9-complete , so that it is essentially the hardest problem any quantum computer can hope to solve .    consider the ( unitary ) modular category @xmath10 obtained as a subquotient of the representation category of the quantum group @xmath1 with @xmath11 ( associated with the @xmath3-chern - simons - witten tqft at level @xmath12 ) .",
    "we note the following :    1 .",
    "the images of the associated braid group representations factor over finite groups @xcite .",
    "a topological quantum computer realized upon a physical system algebraically modeled by @xmath10 , while highly - entangling ( see @xcite , @xcite ) is not universal .",
    "the associated link invariant is @xmath13 the jones polynomial evaluated at @xmath14 , which can be computed in polynomial time @xcite .",
    "two paradigms based upon these examples might then associate density of the braid group image with universal quantum computers and @xmath7-hard computational problems , and finite braid group images with non - universal ( but potentially entangling ) quantum devices and polynomial - time computational problems .",
    "indeed , all evaluations of the jones , homflypt and kauffman link invariants that are polynomial - time computable on a classical computer are associated with `` classical '' link invariants ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorems 6.3.2 , 6.3.5 and 6.3.6 ) ) , by which we mean link invariants pre - dating quantum topology . moreover , the corresponding braid group images in these cases have been shown to be finite in essentially all cases ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . however",
    ", a deeper examination of further examples reveals that this is not quite correct and a slight refinement is necessary .",
    "in this paper we intend to describe such a refinement of these two paradigms .",
    "our aim is three - fold : to give paradigms that can be of theoretical value to physicists , to describe a few conjectures of mathematical interest , and to present one perspective on the landscape of inter - related fields represented in the topological quantum computation endeavor .",
    "any attempt to be fully self - contained would require the introduction of many concepts from category theory , low - dimensional topology , complexity theory and condensed matter physics . for brevity s sake , we will content ourselves with providing the reader with a few references . for an excellent survey of the physical and theoretical set - up for tqcs ,",
    "see @xcite . for the categorical and topological concepts ,",
    "see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for complexity theory applied to topological invariants , see @xcite .",
    "the author would like to thank the following people for their generosity in valuable correspondence and conversations : s. witherspoon , l. goldberg , y. zhang , j. ospina , m. rojas , a. bulatov , z. wang , g. kuperberg , t. stanford , and m. thistlethwaite .",
    "we briefly describe some of the important features of modular categories and their relationships with topological phases , link invariants and topological quantum computers .    a unitary modular category ( umc ) @xmath15 is a semisimple @xmath16-linear rigid ribbon category of finite rank satisfying a certain non - degeneracy condition , such that the morphism spaces are equipped with a positive definite hermitian form compatible with the other structures .",
    "the representation category of a finite group is an example of a category that satisfies all but one of the defining axioms of unitary modular tensor categories : namely it fails the _ modularity _ ( non - degeneracy ) condition .",
    "umcs are constructed in a diversity of ways from various fields of mathematics .",
    "often very different constructions yield equivalent categories , so we will only list a few well - known explicit constructions .    1 .   * quantum groups . * to any finite dimensional simple lie algebra @xmath17 and a root of unity @xmath18 one may associate a pre - modular category @xmath19 .",
    "these are obtained as subquotients of the category of finite dimensional representations of the quantum group @xmath20 , see @xcite for a survey .",
    "such a category may fail to be modular or unitary ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , but such circumstances can be avoided by certain restrictions on @xmath21 . specifically , define @xmath22 for lie types @xmath23 and @xmath24 , @xmath25 for lie types @xmath26 and @xmath27 and @xmath28 for lie type @xmath29 .",
    "then @xmath19 is a umc provided @xmath30 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "* finite groups .",
    "* fix a finite group @xmath31 and a 3-cocycle @xmath32 .",
    "then the twisted double of @xmath31 , @xmath33 , is a finite dimensional quasi - triangular quasi - hopf algebra .",
    "the representation category @xmath34 is always a umc , see @xcite for details .",
    "3 .   * doubled spherical categories .",
    "* there is a doubling procedure from which one obtains a modular category @xmath35 from a _ spherical category _",
    "@xmath36 ( see @xcite for the precise definition , and @xcite for the double construction ) .",
    "briefly , a spherical category is a tensor category that is not necessarily braided but for which one has a canonical trace function .",
    "examples are ribbon categories and certain categories obtained from von neumann algebras ( see @xcite for a description of the latter ) . in fact",
    ", the representation categories of twisted doubles of finite groups can be obtained as the double of the spherical category @xmath37)$ ] of representations of the group algebra of @xmath31 .",
    "very few explicit `` new '' examples of modular categories obtained in this way have been worked out .",
    "a few infinite families can be found in @xcite , and the analysis of two examples are worked out in detail in @xcite .",
    "if the spherical category @xmath36 is unitary the double @xmath35 will be a umc .",
    "the axioms of a umc imply that for any object @xmath38 in a umc @xmath15 one obtains a ( highly non - degenerate ) unitary representation @xmath39 . recall that @xmath40 , the braid group on @xmath41-strands , is the group with @xmath42 generators @xmath43 satisfying :    1 .",
    "@xmath44 if @xmath45 2 .",
    "@xmath46 for @xmath47 .",
    "the braiding on @xmath15 requires that there is are natural braiding isomorphisms @xmath48 .",
    "in particular one obtains natural isomorphisms @xmath49 so that the left action of @xmath50 on itself induces the representation @xmath51 by @xmath52 the unitarity of @xmath51 is due to the fact that @xmath50 is a hilbert space , the naturality of the braiding isomorphisms and the compatibility of the hermitian form with the other structures .",
    "given such a representation it is natural to ask    what is the closure of @xmath53 in @xmath54 ?",
    "indeed , this question was asked by jones in @xcite long before its relevance to quantum computing was realized .",
    "let us suppose that we have a decomposition @xmath55 into irreducible @xmath40-representations , and fix one irreducible subrepresentation @xmath56 .",
    "denote by @xmath57 the closure of the image of @xmath40 in @xmath58 .",
    "then @xmath57 modulo its center is exactly one of the following :    1 .   a finite abelian group 2 .   a finite non - abelian group 3",
    "an infinite compact group containing @xmath59 4 .   an infinite compact group not containing @xmath59",
    "these motivate the following :    1 .   if @xmath60 is always a finite group for all objects @xmath38 in @xmath15 , all @xmath61 , and all irreducible subrepresentations @xmath62",
    "then we say @xmath15 has * property f*. 2 .   if @xmath60 is always a finite _ abelian _ group for all objects @xmath38 in @xmath15 , all @xmath61 , and all irreducible subrepresentations @xmath62 then we say @xmath15 has * property a*. ( observe that this is the case whenever @xmath63 for all @xmath64 and @xmath65 . ) 3 .   if there exists an object @xmath38 in @xmath15 and @xmath66 such that for all @xmath67 and for each irreducible subrepresentation @xmath62 the group @xmath60 contains @xmath68 we say @xmath15 has the * density property*.    in nearly all cases one encounters in the literature , @xmath15 has either property * f * or the density property ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "one may generalize the construction above in the following way .",
    "the _ pure braid group _",
    "@xmath69 is the ( normal ) subgroup of @xmath40 generated by the conjugacy class of @xmath70 , or equivalently , the kernel of the obvious homomorphism @xmath71 that sends @xmath72 to the transposition @xmath73 .",
    "so geometrically @xmath69 consists of the braids whose strands begin and end at the same position .",
    "now fix any set of @xmath41 objects @xmath74 .",
    "then @xmath69 acts on @xmath75 in the obvious way using the braiding operators of the form @xmath76 and their conjugates .",
    "one might ask if the image of @xmath69 is finite or infinite for all @xmath41 and all choices of @xmath77 .",
    "but this is not a more general question : if we define @xmath78 then if @xmath15 has property @xmath79 , @xmath40 has finite image on @xmath50 , so that by restricting to @xmath69 and to the subspace @xmath80 , one sees that the @xmath69 image is finite as well .",
    "obviously the converse is true as well : since @xmath69 has finite index , we may take @xmath81 for all @xmath82 and so finiteness of the @xmath69 image implies finiteness of the @xmath40 image .",
    "similar statements can be made if we replace @xmath69 by any finite index subgroup of @xmath83 obtained as a pull - back of a subgroup of @xmath84 via the homomorphism above .",
    "for example , the subgroup of @xmath40 generated by those elements with the first strand beginning and ending at the same vertical position is the pull - back of the subgroup of @xmath84 that fixes @xmath85 .",
    "associated to any modular category @xmath15 is a @xmath86-tqft , which gives rise to @xmath4-manifold and link invariants .",
    "in essence the link invariants are obtained by representing a link @xmath87 as the closure of a braid @xmath88 , and then taking the trace of the image of @xmath89 in one of the representations @xmath51 of @xmath40 described above .",
    "more generally , one colors each component of @xmath87 with objects @xmath77 of @xmath15 and represents the colored link as the closure of a braid @xmath90 where the strands of @xmath90 must respect the given coloring .",
    "then one takes the trace of the image of @xmath90 in the appropriate endomorphism space",
    ". see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter ii ) for full details .",
    "there are two standard choices that will appear below .",
    "we consider the invariants corresponding to coloring all components with either a fixed simple object @xmath91 or the sum of all simple objects .",
    "the link invariants associated to the modular categories mentioned above are as follows , where @xmath18 :",
    "the link invariant associated to @xmath92 where we color each component with the object analogous to the irreducible @xmath12-dimensional representation of @xmath93 is the jones polynomial @xmath94 .",
    "2 .   more generally , the link invariant associated to @xmath95 is a one - variable specialization of the ( reparameterized ) homflypt polynomial @xmath96 . as above",
    ", the invariant @xmath97 corresponds to coloring each strand with the object analogous to the @xmath41-dimensional representation of @xmath98 . in the setting of hecke algebras",
    ", this corresponds to the @xmath41-row quotient .",
    "3 .   consider the category @xmath19 where @xmath17 is of lie type @xmath26 or @xmath99 , and in the first two cases @xmath21 is even , and let @xmath38 be the object analogous to the vector representation of @xmath17 .",
    "then the invariant associated to @xmath38 is a specialization of the ( dubrovnik version ) of the kauffman polynomial @xmath100 , where @xmath65 depends on the rank of @xmath17 .",
    "link invariants associated with @xmath19 for @xmath17 of other lie types have not been extensively studied , nor have invariants associated with objects other than those analogous to the vector representation .",
    "there are two exceptions .",
    "explicit skein relations have been worked out by g. kuperberg for lie type @xmath29 .",
    "also , the invariant associated with the object analogous to the fundamental spin representation of @xmath101 in @xmath102 with @xmath103 , @xmath104 an odd prime is known to be related to the homology modulo @xmath104 of the double cyclic cover @xmath105 of @xmath106 branched over the given link @xmath87 ( see @xcite and @xcite ) . 5 .",
    "the link invariants associated to the modular categories @xmath34 with @xmath107 are described in @xcite .",
    "specifically , if we color each component of @xmath87 with the sum of the simple objects ( or with @xmath108 itself ) , one gets ( a normalization of ) the classical link invariant @xmath109 that is , for a fixed link @xmath87 it counts the homomorphisms from the fundamental group of the link - complement to the finite group @xmath31 .",
    "the tqfts associated with doubled spherical categories are usually called turaev - viro(-ocneanu ) tqfts .",
    "the associated link invariants are not well - studied , although some attention has been paid to two of these `` exotic '' examples , see @xcite .",
    "later the computational complexity of evaluating these link invariants will be discussed .",
    "two important complexity classes are @xmath110 and @xmath7 .",
    "the class of functions that are computable in polynomial time in the length of the input are of complexity @xmath110 , which is most closely associated with decision problems of complexity @xmath111 .",
    "the class of counting functions of complexity @xmath7 are related to decision problems of complexity @xmath112 , where instead of asking if there exists a `` yes '' answer one counts the number of `` yes '' answers .",
    "for example , deciding if a given boolean expression @xmath24 has an assignment of truth values that satisfy @xmath24 is @xmath112-complete , while counting the number of such assignments is @xmath7-complete .",
    "the two paradigms are shown in figures [ fig : dense ] and [ fig : finite ] respectively .",
    "each has three boxes representing braid group images , complexity of link invariants , and utility in quantum computation .",
    "our limited expertise in physics led us to exclude any corresponding speculations from the paradigm , however , see remark [ conclusions ] below .",
    "the `` link invariant '' box requires some explanation .",
    "we say computation of the link invariants are @xmath7-hard because in each known case the exact computation of the invariant can be reduced to a counting problem .",
    "for example , an evaluation of the jones polynomial of a link @xmath87 at a root of unity @xmath6 is an integer linear combination of the galois conjugates of @xmath113 , so that computing each coefficient may be regarded as a counting problem . that such an evaluation is _ hard _ means that if we could find an efficient algorithm for such a problem , we could ( in principle ) adapt our algorithm to efficiently solve any @xmath7 problem .",
    "however , comparing the quantum computation of a link invariant to classical exact computation is at some level unrealistic for at least two reasons : 1 ) quantum computation is probabilistic , while classical computation is deterministic and 2 ) most quantum computations will involve approximate application of some quantum gate ( unitary operator ) , so that the output will be an approximate evaluation as well . a more relevant question to ask is : does a link invariant @xmath114 have a _ fully polynomial randomized approximation scheme _ ( fpras ) ? that is , does there exist an algorithm whose input is a link @xmath87 with braid index at most @xmath41 and an error threshold @xmath115 , whose output is a number @xmath116 so that @xmath117 that runs in polynomial time in @xmath41 and @xmath118 ?",
    "of course by running such an algorithm multiple times , one may improve the certainty that the approximation of @xmath119 is correct within an @xmath120 factor of @xmath119 .",
    "the associated decision problem complexity class is @xmath121 ( _ radomized polynomial time _ ) .",
    "it is widely believed that @xmath122 , and the non - existence of an @xmath123 for a given problem is usually proved under this assumption .",
    "most of the relationships in the finite image paradigm ( figure [ fig : finite ] ) can be understood from the remarks on the dense image paradigm above .",
    "notice that we have excluded the finite abelian braid group images from the description .",
    "this is because the cases where the images of the braid group are finite abelian are mathematically trivial , corresponding to _",
    "abelian anyons_. firstly , the link invariant will essentially count components or at best linking numbers , which can be done classically in polynomial time . secondly , the representations of the braid group in these cases are all @xmath85-dimensional . because of this",
    ", there is no ground state degeneracy and hence any device based upon such systems would not even be capable of efficiently storing information , i.e. they would be non - entangling .",
    "it is interesting to note that , to date , the only topological phases that have been convincingly shown to exist are abelian anyons ( see @xcite ) .",
    "non - universal quantum devices that can at least produce entangled qubits could potentially be used to store quantum information and even be useful in quantum error correction ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a well - known example is the bell basis change matrix which is related to the jones polynomial at @xmath124 .",
    "analyses of the braid group images and the computational complexity of the link invariant evaluations associated to many of the modular categories described above have been carried out .",
    "we discuss each in turn , recording the precise evidence for the two paradigms in table [ evidence ] where speculations are in bold type .",
    "for notational convenience , set @xmath18 , and denote by @xmath125 the number of components of a link @xmath87 .",
    "let @xmath126 be the dimension of the homology space modulo @xmath65 of the double cyclic cover of @xmath106 branched over @xmath87 .",
    "@xmath127 is a classical invariant that only depends on the linking matrix of @xmath87 .      for @xmath92 with @xmath18 , @xmath128 and @xmath129",
    "the object corresponding to the fundamental @xmath12-dimensional representation of @xmath93 the algebra @xmath130 is isomorphic to the temperley - lieb algebra @xmath131 .",
    "jones determined precisely when the braid group images are finite in @xcite , and in all other cases it is shown in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 0.1 ) that the braid group images are dense .",
    "the ( exact ) computational complexity of the corresponding link invariant the jones polynomial @xmath94 was worked out in @xcite , where it is shown that , except for @xmath132 the complexity class is @xmath7-hard .",
    "this was accomplished by using a result of thistlethwaite that evaluating the jones polynomial at @xmath133 for @xmath87 an alternating link is essentially equivalent to computing the tutte polynomial of an associated plane graph @xmath134 at @xmath135 , which is shown to be @xmath7-hard except at the special points described above .",
    "the jones polynomial at these special points degenerates to a `` classical '' link - invariant that is computable in polynomial time .",
    "we conjecture the following :      this conjecture is partially motivated by the belief that quantum computers are strictly more powerful than classical computers .",
    "if this conjecture were false , there would be an @xmath123 for a @xmath9-complete problem . a second",
    ", less philosophical , piece of evidence is found in @xcite , where it is shown that , away from the positive quadrant in the rational @xmath136-plane and a few exceptional curves , no @xmath123 exists for evaluating the tutte polynomial at @xmath137 .",
    "this result does not apply to complex pairs @xmath137 and so does not give any information for the jones polynomial at roots of unity , but is nonetheless compelling evidence for our conjecture .",
    "generalizations of the results above to the categories @xmath95 with @xmath18 and the corresponding specializations of the the homflypt polynomial are found in @xcite ( due to vertigan ) , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the role of the temperley - lieb algebra is taken by specializations of the two - parameter hecke - algebra ( see @xcite ) , and the results are of the same format with one exception : for @xmath138 one may have infinite braid group images that are not dense , see ( * ? ? ? * theorem 4.1 ) .",
    "see also @xcite for a related invariant obtained by summing over all simple objects .",
    "the computational complexity of evaluating of the kauffman polynomial has been worked out by vertigan , see @xcite .",
    "the relevant modular categories are obtained from the categories of the form @xmath19 with @xmath139 . in these cases",
    "the algebras @xmath50 are related to specializations of the form @xmath140 of @xmath141-algebras @xmath142 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "2.1 ) ) , where as usual @xmath38 is the quantum analogue of the vector representation .",
    "the braid group images are worked out in all non - trivial cases except @xmath143 in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in general",
    "the images are either finite or dense , although exceptions are found in @xcite , and are expected for @xmath143 .",
    "the categories @xmath145 with @xmath146 may be regarded as the extension of the series of modular categories whose first two terms are @xmath147 and @xmath148 . at least for @xmath149 prime ,",
    "the corresponding link invariants are @xmath150 where @xmath151 with @xmath105 the double cyclic cover of @xmath106 branched over @xmath87 , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "polynomial algorithms exist for computing the dimension of these homology spaces , and the braid group images are shown to be finite ( symplectic ) groups in @xcite .",
    "it seems reasonable that this should hold for arbitrary @xmath152 as well .",
    "while the fact that the invariant corresponding to the modular category @xmath154 for @xmath31 a finite group is the classical invariant @xmath155 has been known for some time , the computational complexity has not been studied to our knowledge . moreover ,",
    "the fact that @xmath154 has property @xmath79 was shown only recently @xcite .            1 .",
    "clearly if @xmath31 is an abelian group and @xmath87 has @xmath65 components , then @xmath156 .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that if @xmath31 is nilpotent and @xmath87 is a knot then @xmath157 is constant .",
    "so at least for knots , @xmath155 is polynomial time computable for @xmath31 nilpotent .",
    "3 .   in @xcite",
    "an algorithm for computing the number of homomorphisms from a given finitely presented group @xmath158 to a finite solvable group is given .",
    "it is not clear if this algorithm finishes in polynomial time ( in , say , the number of generators of @xmath158 ) , but it certainly supports the case for ( b ) .",
    "moreover , in preliminary computations ( worked out with s. witherspoon ) for @xmath31 a generalized dihedral group we found that the corresponding braid group representation is equivalent to a finite field evaluation of the burau representation .",
    "this is significant , as the burau representation supports the alexander polynomial , which is known to be polynomial - time computable .",
    "even in the non - solvable case , an algorithm exists : @xmath159 has presentation @xmath160 with @xmath41 and @xmath161 are bounded by @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the number of strands in some projection of @xmath87 and @xmath164 is the number of crossings .",
    "one checks all @xmath165 @xmath41-tuples against the @xmath161 relations to find homomorphisms .",
    "one could improve this algorithm slightly by applying automorphisms of @xmath31 , but the algorithm would still be exponential in @xmath41 .",
    "perhaps a randomization of this algorithm where one samples a moderately - sized subset of the @xmath41-tuples of elements of @xmath31 and then approximates @xmath155 by proportion would provide an @xmath123 . whether this could be done efficiently and accurately would require some analysis . we should mention that it is widely believed that an @xmath123 exists for computing @xmath155 ( @xcite ) .                                                                  1 .",
    "we speculate that an appropriate physical aspect of the paradigm would be as follows : when the braid group image is dense , then it is unlikely that there is an efficient way to approximately simulate the corresponding physical system .",
    "our expertise in the subject is not sufficient to say anything authoritative , but it seems reasonable that an efficient approximate simulation of the physical system could be used to construct an fpras for the link invariant . when the braid group image is finite , we might expect that efficient numerical methods ( such as quantum monte carlo ) exist for ( approximately ) simulating the corresponding quantum mechanical systems ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "2 .   there is a related conjecture characterizing umcs with property @xmath79 by the categorical dimensions of their simple objects .",
