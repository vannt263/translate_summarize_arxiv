    "wide - angle tail ( wat ) galaxies form a class of radio galaxies , usually found in clusters , whose radio jets have been bent into a wide * c * shape .",
    "the general morphology of wats suggests that the sources interact significantly with their external environment .",
    "the most natural interpretation of the jet bending is that the jets are being swept back by ram pressure resulting from the high velocity motion of the associated active elliptical galaxy through its surrounding intra - cluster medium ( icm ) , first developed by begelman , rees & blandford ( 1979 ) and applied by a number of investigators ( e.g.  burns 1981 , pinkey 1994 ) .",
    "in addition to ram - pressure , buoyancy forces were introduced to explain the bending of the jets ( e.g.  gull & northover 1973 , sakelliou 1996 ) .",
    "if the jet density is lower than the density of the surrounding medium , buoyancy forces will drag the jets towards regions of the icm where the densities are equal .",
    "a point first noticed by burns ( 1981 ) was that wats are usually associated with brightest cluster galaxies ( bcg ; d or cd galaxies ) , which are expected to reside at rest at the bottom of the clusters gravitational potential well ( quintana & lawrie 1982 , merritt 1984 , bird 1994 ) .",
    "thus the large velocities of the wat host galaxies relative to the icm needed for the ram pressure models to shape the jets seemed to be inconsistent with velocities typical for bcgs .  ; recently oegerle ( 2005 ) , analyzing 25 abell clusters , showed that peculiar velocities of cd galaxies differ only by @xmath2  from the mean cluster velocities . ] therefore , it was necessary to evoke alternative scenarios to explain the bent shape of wat galaxies ( e.g.  eilek 1984 ) .",
    "however , the most prominent explanation is that the jets are bent by ram pressure .",
    "it has been suggested in numerous studies that the necessary ram pressure may be provided during cluster mergers ( e.g.  pinkey , burns & hill 1994 , loken 1995 , gomez 1997 , sakelliou 1996 , 2000 ) .",
    "this merger scenario is consistent with cosmological models , such as the cold dark matter model ( cdm ) , which propose that the structure in the universe is formed hierarchically with large features forming from mergers of smaller groups .",
    "the cluster potential well deepens then through accretion of poor clusters , dark matter and gas into more massive systems .",
    "the material is accreted from supercluster filaments which connect clusters into the large - scale structure of the universe ( evrard 1990 , jing 1995 , frenk 1996 , burns 2002 ) .",
    "based on rosat pspc x - ray observations of a sample of 9 abell clusters containing wat galaxies , gomez ( 1997 ) find evidence for statistically significant x - ray substructure in 90% ( @xmath3 out of @xmath4 ) of the clusters hosting wats , as well as a strong correlation of the orientation of the jets and the direction of x - ray elongation within the core of the cluster . combined with numerical hydro / n - body simulations their results are consistent with wat clusters undergoing mergers with groups or subclusters of galaxies .",
    "sakelliou & merrifield ( 2000 ) show that wats are not generally located at the centers of their host clusters as defined by their x - ray emission .",
    "they also find that the orientation of the bent jets is found to be preferentially pointed directly towards or away from the cluster center .",
    "thus , if the morphology is due to ram pressure , wats are then primarily on radial orbits through the cluster .",
    "these results are explained as a natural consequence of cluster mergers creating wat galaxies ( for details see sakelliou & merrifield 2000 and references therein ) .",
    "blanton ( 2001 ) present optical imaging and spectroscopic observations of environments surrounding 10 bent radio sources .",
    "they find that the clusters display a range of line - of - sight velocity dispersions , @xmath5 , from about @xmath6 .",
    "the upper limit of @xmath5 suggests that the host clusters are either massive clusters and/or merging systems with significant substructure .",
    "since wats are usually found in cluster environments , they can be used as an efficient tool for cluster search , especially for high - redshift clusters where we are biased by the dimming of galaxies in the optical and the icm in x - ray emission .",
    "this approach has been successfully tested by blanton ( 2000 , 2001 , 2003 ) using the vla first survey ( faint images of the radio sky at twenty centimeters survey ; becker , white & helfand 1995 ) to search for galaxy clusters via wat galaxies .",
    "the highest redshift cluster they have identified to date is at @xmath7 ( blanton 2003 ) .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the properties of a wat radio galaxy ( hereafter cwat-01 ) found in the vla - cosmos @xmath8 survey , previously detected , but not resolved by the nvss ( nrao vla sky survey ; condon 1998 ) survey and not detected in the vla first survey ( becker , white & helfand 1995 ) . the multiwavelength data set of the cosmos survey ( scoville 2006a ) enables us to use the radio data to derive the properties of this radio galaxy and the optical / x - ray data to investigate its host environment . in ",

    "the final @xmath12 map has a typical rms of @xmath15  @xmath16  @xmath17jy / beam in the inner @xmath18  @xmath19  @xmath20 with a resolution of @xmath21 , thus making it the largest contiguous area covered in the radio - wavelengths regime with such a high sensitivity .",
    "the vla - cosmos large project catalog ( presented in schinnerer 2006 ) contains @xmath22 radio sources , @xmath23 of which are clearly extended ( most of them are double - lobed radio galaxies ) .",
    "the sensitivity of the survey combined with the high resolution and the large area coverage makes the vla - cosmos project extremely valuable for e.g.  studies of the sub - mjy radio population ( i.e. the faint end of the radio luminosity function ) , dust - obscured star - formation history of the universe , evolution of radio - loud active - galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",

    "the flux limit for the cluster identification in the @xmath34  kev energy band is @xmath35  erg  @xmath36 s@xmath37 .",
    "finoguenov ( 2006 ) report four diffuse structures within @xmath38 of cwat-01 , one of them containing cwat-01.we perform the spectral analysis of the extended emission associated with the four identified clusters in the following way .",
    "the epic pn observations of the cosmos field have been merged together and a uniform cleaning criterion for background flares has been subsequently applied .",

    "we achieve a uniform background level for the clean dataset .",

    "however , the region around cwat-01 is still covered at an effective depth of @xmath40  ksec as the removed observations are all located at the edge of the cosmos field .",
    "since the instrumental background is not uniform over the detector ( lamb et al . 2002 ) , in order to estimate the background , we produce a background file from the same merged event file by excluding the area containing a detected x - ray source .",
    "this removes @xmath41 of the area , which we account for in correcting for the background .",
    "the background is further assumed to be the same in detector coordinates . in calculating the background spectrum , the sky position of the cluster",

    "thus , the derived velocity is a rough estimate of cwat-01 s velocity relative to the icm as a function of @xmath253 .    another hydrodynamical model , that we apply to cwat-01 to estimate the galaxy velocity , was first proposed by begelman ( 1979 ) to explain the jets in ngc1265 .",
    "the curvature of the jets is again assumed to be produced by ram pressure exerted on the galaxy as it moves through the icm .",
    "the ram pressure is balanced by the centrifugal force exerted by the jet as it curves :    @xmath258    where @xmath259 is the bulk jet velocity , @xmath246 is the scale hight , @xmath260 is the radius of curvature , @xmath245 is the galaxy velocity and @xmath248 and @xmath247 are the icm and jet densities , respectively . placing the mean jet velocity of the velocity range derived in ",
    "[ lifetime ] , @xmath261 , into eq .",
    "[ [ begelman ] ] , using an estimate of the scale height ( at point c0 in fig .",
    "[ loop_1.4 ] ) of @xmath262 ( @xmath263 kpc ) and the radius of curvature of @xmath264 ( @xmath265 kpc ) , we show the galaxy velocity as a function of the @xmath266 ratio in fig .",
    "[ vgal ] ( dashed lines ) .",
    "indicated is the galaxy velocity range corresponding to the jet velocity range , @xmath267 ( narrow hatched region ) .    requiring that the conditions of both equations , eq .",
    "[ [ bend_point ] ]  and  [ [ begelman ] ] , are satisfied ( as illustrated in fig .  [ vgal ] ) , we obtain an estimate of both , the galaxy velocity , @xmath245 , and the jet density , @xmath247 .",
    "@xmath245 is in the range of about @xmath268 and @xmath247 is @xmath269 , respectively .",
    "the icm density is known from the spectral analysis , @xmath270 , thus the estimated jet density with the corresponding errors is about @xmath271 .",
    "so far we have neglected possible _ in situ _ particle acceleration within the jets .",
    "if particle re - acceleration occurs then the bulk lifetime of the synchrotron electrons in the jets would be higher than the @xmath272  myr estimated in  [ lifetime ] . a lower limit of the galaxy velocity",
    "can then be estimated by assuming efficient conversion of kinetic energy into internal energy in the plasma jet flow ( e.g.  eilek 1979 ) . if the observed luminosity , @xmath273 , of the jets is supplied by conversion of the bulk kinetic energy with an efficiency , @xmath274 , then @xmath275 ( e.g.  burns 1981 , odonoghue 1993 ) . substituting @xmath259 in terms of the luminosity into eq .",
    "[ [ begelman ] ] , one gets :    @xmath276    which is only weakly dependent on the jet density , @xmath247 . for an efficiency of @xmath119 , assuming the above derived jet density , the galaxy velocity is roughly @xmath277  which is consistent with the results from the previously applied models .",
    "the models we applied to cwat-01 in the above discussion thus suggest that the galaxy velocity relative to the icm is in the range of about @xmath1 .",
    "beers ( 1995 ) report a median velocity dispersion of @xmath278   ( which is in agreement with e.g.   ramella 1994 and ledlow 1996 ) for a sample of mkw / awm poor clusters  .",
    "they find a velocity offset between the velocity of the central galaxy and the mean velocity of the rest of the galaxies of @xmath279   for clusters with no evidence for subclustering .",
    "the velocity range of @xmath1   we found for cwat-01 s host galaxy , which is the dominant galaxy ( bcg ) in its parent cluster , is significantly higher than this limit which indicates recent merger events between less massive systems of galaxies ( bird 1994 ) .",
    "high peculiar velocities are strongly correlated with the presence of substructure in the system ( bird 1994 ) .",
    "indeed , the vta results indicate subclustering in the cwat-01 parent cluster ( @xmath233 and @xmath234 in fig .  [ wat_cluster ] ) . furthermore",
    ", the brightest galaxies in the cluster are strongly concentrated around cwat-01 .",
    "we speculate that sc1 and sc2 interact and , furthermore , that sc2 may be infalling into the gravitational potential of sc1 .",
    "this interaction may cause a dynamical state of the cluster violent enough to produce the inferred relative velocity of the cwat-01 host galaxy to the icm needed to bend the jets in the observed way .",
    "moreover , the irregular assembly of early type galaxies in the cwat-01 parent cluster ( see fig .  [ wat_cluster ] ) suggests that it is not a relaxed system .",
    "the elongated and irregular diffuse x - ray emission of this cluster indicates independently possible merger or accretion events in the cluster .",
    "finoguenov ( 2005 ) have shown that x - ray elongations are often seen at the outskirts of clusters and that their spectral characteristics correspond to a colder , dense gas in pressure equilibrium with the cluster .",
    "this gas is associated with accretion zones in clusters where dense parts of the filaments survive the accretion shock and penetrate the cluster outskirts .",
    "our results suggest that merger events within the cwat-01 parent cluster caused such a dynamical state in the cluster which is needed for bending the radio jets of cwat-01 in the observed way .",
    "such a merging scenario is consistent with conclusions of previous studies which have suggested that the bent shape of wat galaxies is caused by mergers ( e.g.  gomez 1997 , sakelliou 1996 , 2000 ) .",
    "based on a sample of @xmath280 wat galaxies which are located in abell clusters and have rosat x - ray observations sakelliou ( 2000 ) have shown that wats travel predominantly radially towards or away from the center ( as defined by the x - ray centroid ) of their host cluster .",
    "cwat-01 does not seem to be on a radial motion in the projected plane of the sky , as is evident in fig .",
    "[ wat_cluster ] ( bottom panel ) .",
    "this may be a bias caused by projection effects .",
    "however , the gravitational influence of the neighboring clusters may have played a significant role in causing the inferred velocity modulus and direction of cwat-01 s host galaxy relative to the icm .",
    "based on the above arguments we suggest that the radio jets of cwat-01 were bent as a consequence of the motion of cwat-01 relative to the icm induced through interactions between subclusters ( sc1 and sc2 ) and/or interactions between the cwat-01 parent cluster and the other identified clusters .      since cwat-01 seems to be part of a very complex large - scale structure , the possible gravitational influence of the other clusters on the galaxy and its immediate environment can not be neglected .",
    "[ color ] shows the distribution of emission from different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum within the cluster area .",
    "the diffuse x - ray emission has revealed that the cwat-01 parent cluster is only one of the poor clusters encompassed in a larger cluster structure .",
    "the cluster assembly contains a minimum of four x - ray luminous clusters within @xmath0 mpc distance .",
    "in addition , the vta indicates that there is at least one more loose group ( lg - n ; fig .  [ cluster ] ) on the outskirts of the x - ray cluster assembly but not detected in the x - rays .",
    "furthermore , the whole cluster assembly is part of a large - scale structure component ( , scoville 2006c ) extended over @xmath281 mpc in ns direction .",
    "the direction of the jets of cwat-01 is almost perpendicular to the x - ray elongation of the cwat-01 parent cluster as well as to the large - scale elongation of the x - ray emission .",
    "although  spatially extends @xmath281  mpc in ns direction , the direction of its _ long axis _",
    "( as defined in e.g.  novikov 1999 ) is in the nw - se direction ( see fig .  3 in scoville 2006c ) .",
    "hence , the direction of the jets of cwat-01 is almost perpendicular also to the long axis of .",
    "this is in disagreement with the correlation of the alignment between the direction of the jets and a ) the central x - ray emission elongation ( burns 1994 , gomez 1997 ) and b ) the supercluster axis as defined by the distribution of the nearby abell clusters ( novikov 1999 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the misalignment seen in cwat-01 s orientation compared to the parent cluster and to   elongations may not be unexpected if we assume an early stage of cluster formation .",
    "rich clusters form at the intersection of large - scale filaments . compared to numerical simulations ( e.g.  burns 2002 , springel 2005 ) of cluster evolution at @xmath282",
    "the final cluster has not yet formed or relaxed at the intersection of filaments where matter is accreted from numerous filaments .",
    "thus , in such an environment it would not be unexpected to observe a wat galaxy with its jets not aligned with the cluster or large - scale structure elongations .",
    "the x - ray and optical analysis indicate that each individual poor cluster within the cluster assembly is not spherically - symmetric , both in the diffuse x - ray emission and in the spatial distribution of galaxies in the optical ( vta ) .",
    "this strongly indicates that the poor clusters are not in a dynamically relaxed state .",
    "in addition , the overall , large - scale distribution of the cluster assembly is very complex and irregular .",
    "it is likely that the loose group lg - n is bound to the system .",
    "the lack of x - ray emission from this group suggests that the system is not very massive .",
    "the flux limit for the cluster search ( see  [ sec : xdata ] ) allows a detection of an object at @xmath74 with a limiting luminosity of @xmath283  erg  s@xmath37 , which corresponds to a low - mass group ( e.g.  mulchaey 2003 ) . following the luminosity - temperature ( l - t ) relation for groups ( osmond & ponman 2004 ) the limiting temperature then equals @xmath284  kev .",
    "using the mass - temperature ( m - t ) relation from finoguenov ( 2001 ) the minimum mass of a system to be detected in the diffuse @xmath34  kev band at @xmath74 then corresponds to @xmath285 .",
    "thus , the total mass of lg - n has to be less than this mass .",
    "although spectroscopic verification is needed for the physical connection of the clusters , we believe that we are witnessing a protocluster in the process of being built up of multiple galaxy clusters and groups . adding up the estimated masses for the four clusters identified via diffuse x - ray emission ( see tab .",
    "[ t : x2 ] ) and the limiting mass inferred for lg - n the resulting combined mass is @xmath286 .",
    "this is a rough estimate of the total mass of the cluster system once it is formed since it does not include the material between the clusters nor other loose groups that may be bound to the cluster assembly ( the cluster assembly is only part of ) .",
    "thus , the estimated mass that the final cluster may have after the individual clusters merge would correspond to @xmath41 of the coma cluster s total mass .",
    "this is the first time such a complex dynamically young cluster system in the process of formation is identified via a wat radio galaxy .",
    "we have analyzed a wide angle tail ( wat ) radio galaxy , cwat-01 , first resolved in the vla - cosmos survey .",
    "the multiwavelength data set of the cosmos survey have enabled us to identify and analyze the environment of cwat-01 in several independent ways .",
    "the cluster structure revealed via cwat-01 seems to be more complex than any structure hosting wat galaxies reported in the past .",
    "we summarize the basic findings of this analysis as follows :    * the lengths of the eastern and western radio jets of cwat-01 are @xmath87  kpc and @xmath287  kpc , respectively , and the bending angle is @xmath91 in the projected plane of the sky .",
    "it seems to be asymmetric and at this point we can not rule out that the asymmetry is caused by projection effects .",
    "the @xmath13 ghz radio power of @xmath288 puts cwat-01 on the lower end of the fri - ii break region where wats are usually found . *",
    "the host galaxy of cwat-01 is an elliptical galaxy with a shallower surface brightness profile than predicted by the de vaucouleurs law .",
    "it is the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) in the cwat-01 parent cluster .",
    "the surface brightness profile is very well fit by the sersic @xmath289 law with @xmath290 , @xmath291  kpc and @xmath292 consistent with values typical for brightest cluster galaxies ( cd / d ) . *",
    "applying several hydrodynamical models , taking ram pressure and buoyancy forces into account , to explain the observed bending of the radio jets of cwat-01 , the allowed range of the galaxy velocity relative to the icm is approximately @xmath1 . both , the upper and lower velocity are higher than is expected for dominant galaxies ( i.e. bcgs ) in relaxed systems . *",
    "the cluster hosting cwat-01 ( cwat-01 parent cluster ) was detected in diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "the luminosity weighted temperature of the cluster is @xmath199  kev consistent with poor cluster temperatures .",
    "the total mass within the @xmath196 radius is @xmath293 .",
    "the cluster shows evidence for subclustering , both in diffuse x - ray emission and in the spatial distribution of galaxies found from the optical analysis applying the voronoi tessellation - based approach ( vta ) .",
    "the distribution of early type galaxies is not centrally concentrated , it is irregular and partitioned into two apparently distinct subclumps . *",
    "the cwat-01 parent cluster itself is part of a larger cluster assembly consisting of a minimum of 4 clusters within @xmath0  mpc distance identified via diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "the icm temperatures of the three clusters surrounding the cwat-01 parent cluster are in the @xmath294  kev range consistent with temperatures of poor clusters .",
    "the total masses of the clusters within the @xmath196 radius are in the range of about @xmath295 . * the voronoi tessellation - based approach ( vta )",
    "results indicate that there is at least one more loose group that is likely bound to the system . from the x - ray detection limit for diffuse sources",

    "our results strongly indicate that we are witnessing the formation of a large cluster from an assembly of multiple clusters , consistent with the scenario of hierarchical structure formation .",
    "if this is the case , then the estimated minimum total mass of the final single cluster after the poor clusters merge would correspond to @xmath286 or @xmath297 of the coma cluster mass . in this scenario , the large velocity of the cwat-01 host galaxy relative to the icm",
    "can easily be explained .",
    "the cwat-01 parent cluster seems not to be relaxed , thus a plausible explanation of the motion of the galaxy relative to the icm is interaction of the two identified subclumps ( sc1 and sc2 ) within the cluster . on the other hand , we can not rule out the gravitational influence of the other poor clusters as a cause for inducing such a velocity .    resolving the detailed physics causing the bending of the radio jets of cwat-01",
