    "the old problem of hydrodynamic turbulence has in recent years attracted resurgent interest stimulated by the new generation of laboratory experiments and the newly acquired ability of the direct numerical simulations to probe interesting aspects of turbulence . in the light of the new ideas and developments",
    "there has also been new appreciation of the seminal contributions of kolmogorov , reviewed in a recent book by frisch @xcite , and of kraichnan to whom the present volume and this article are dedicated .",
    "the key issues and the progress of the last years have been well reviewed@xcite and are well represented in the present festschrift .",
    "much effort has been dedicated to 1 ) documenting and understanding the anomalous ( i.e. non - kolmogorov 41 ) scaling of high moments@xcite associated with intermittency , 2 ) understanding the structure and the local geometry of the intermittent regions of the flow@xcite .",
    "on the theory side new ideas derived from the new understanding of anomalous scaling of the passive scalar problem @xcite and of the burger s",
    "turbulence@xcite both pioneered by kraichnan@xcite .",
    "yet , the theoretical description of turbulence based on first principles , i.e. on a controlled approximation to the navier - stokes equations , is still over the horizon and to proceed in the right direction one must rely on phenomenology .",
    "one reason for pursuing the modeling approach is the need to bridge the existing gulf between our understanding of the scaling@xcite of turbulent fluctuations and their structure or",
    " statistical geometry@xcite .",
    "a step in this direction will be the subject of the present paper .",
    "our goal here is to advance a phenomenological model for the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of turbulent velocity fluctuations .",
    "we shall start by noting that the longitudinal velocity difference between two observation points@xcite , while being most readily observable , seems a poor candidate for a fundamental dynamical field in terms of which to attempt a closed statistical description .",
    "the intuitive reason is that the longitudinal velocity difference senses only one of the 8 locally independent components of the velocity gradient tensor which govern the dynamics of the velocity field .",
    "instead we shall choose the fundamental field to be the coarse grained velocity gradient tensor @xmath0 defined over a region @xmath1 with characteristic scale @xmath2 lying in the inertial range .",
    "this region may be best thought of as a local correlation volume of the velocity gradient coarse - grained on scale @xmath2 - an `` eddy '' of sort .",
    "the phenomenological model then will be based on the lagrangian dynamics of the @xmath3-volume , parametrized by four points - the `` tetrad '' - and its strain and vorticity fields as described by @xmath4 .",
    "effort will be made to preserve the essential non - linear dynamics governing evolution of coarse grained strain and vorticity and the concomitant distortion of the lagrangian volume .",
    "this dynamics expresses the fundamental constraints due to the conservation of energy and circulation .",
    "in contrast , the dynamics of velocity fluctuations arising from the scales smaller than that of the tetrad ( and generating incoherent motion of the points ) will be modeled as a gaussian white process obeying k41 scaling .",
    "essential element of the theory advanced below will be the decomposition of the pressure into the local part determined by the m - field via incompressibility and the non - local part due to the contribution of distant regions , which will again be modeled as a gaussian random force .",
    "such an approximation for the pressure may perhaps be justifiable in large spatial dimension @xcite , but we shall be content with exploring its consequences and comparing the results with the direct numerical simulations .    we can not hope to review here the evolution of the phenomenological modeling ideas , yet we shall put the present work into the context of two recent efforts .",
    "the `` pdf models '' of pope and coworkers@xcite attempt to close the equation for the velocity probability distribution function ( pdf ) on the level of @xmath5 point : in contrast , our model deals with relative velocity differences on 4 points which naturally brings in kolmogorov s ideas and allows to address the intermittency phenomenon .",
    "the two approaches however share the need to model the pressure hessian / strain- rate correlations ( in our case on the coarse - grained level ) and share the realization that this model is improved by incorporating dynamical information about local anisotropy@xcite(in our case furnished by the moment of inertia tensor of the evolving lagrangian volume ) .",
    "another point of reference is the @xmath6 pdf closure advanced by yakhot@xcite on the basis of the work of kraichnan@xcite and polyakov@xcite . there",
    "too one arrived at a fokker - planck type equation for the pdf of velocity differences at given point separation , yet the approach differs from the present one in the treatment of the correlations of large and small scale fluctuations and our approach , by virtue of tracking a tetrad rather than a pair will retain more of the geometry of the flow .",
    "the model will be presented in section 2 in the form of the stochastic equations of motion for two tensors specifying the coarse - grained velocity gradient and the shape ( i.e. moment of inertia ) of the evolving lagrangian volume .",
    "we shall write down the corresponding fokker - planck equation for the probability distribution function and discuss the energy transfer considerations which played the key role in the formulation of the model .",
    "section 3 relates the deterministic aspects of the model to the so called restricted euler ( re ) dynamics that has been investigated by vieillefosse@xcite originally in the context of the finite time singularities ( see also lorat@xcite ) and cantwell and coworkers @xcite with the emphasis on the local topology of the flow .",
    "re describes the evolution of the velocity gradient at a point within an isotropic approximation for the pressure which allows to close the euler equation locally .",
    "we shall see that elevation of the dynamics to the coarse - grained level and the introduction of the second dynamical field to keep track of the shape of the lagrangian correlation volume ( which depends on the @xmath7 of the strain ) allows to go beyond the isotropic pressure approximation : the unphysical finite time singularity of re is removed , while the sensible short time dynamical properties ( related for example to the vorticity strain alignment @xcite ) are retained . finally in section 3",
    "the deterministic dynamics will be compared with the empirical ",
    "mean field ",
    "equation of motion for the coarse grained velocity tensor @xmath8 , constructed from the conditional average @xmath9 measured in the dns of the navier - stokes at @xmath10 . in section 4",
    "we return to the stochastic model and write down the formal solution of the fokker - planck equation in terms of the path integral relating the probability of a given coarse grained velocity gradient on a given inertial range tetrad to the velocity pdf on the integral scale .",
    "this path integral representation serves as a point of departure for the semiclassical approximation .",
    "it also has a well defined deterministic limit where the effect of the stochastic terms in the tetrad dynamics can be neglected . in the latter limit",
    "the probability of `` observing '' any given coarse - grained velocity gradient on an inertial range tetrad is determined by the probability of its integral scale preimage and can be calculated by integrating the equations of motion backward in time .",
    "this crude but simple approximation is employed in section 5 in order to gain insight into the behavior of the model and to elaborate its statistical predictions emphasizing energy transfer , enstrophy and its production and the alignment of vorticity and strain .",
    "the comparison of the results with the direct numerical simulation of the navier - stokes equations is quite encouraging .",
    "the calculated probability distribution function also exhibits anomalous scaling of high moments . in conclusion ,",
    "section 6 is a summary and the outline of further inquiry .",
    "the minimal parametrization of the @xmath3 volume is a tetrahedron ( more generally a @xmath11-dimensional simplex ) defined by four , hence _",
    "tetrad _ , ( or @xmath12 ) lagrangian points , @xmath13 , which upon elimination of the center of mass define a triad of vectors @xmath14 : @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17",
    ". it will be useful to treat this triad of vectors as @xmath18 matrix , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the spatial index .",
    "analogously , by eliminating the center of mass velocity from the instantaneous velocity of the vertices , @xmath21 , one can define a triad of relative velocities , @xmath22 .",
    "the coarse grained gradient field can now be defined simply by interpolation : @xmath23    alternatively and more generally one may decompose the  observed  velocity differences , @xmath24 into a slow component arising from the scales greater than the radius of gyration , @xmath25 , represented by the coarse grained velocity gradient matrix @xmath4 and the rapidly fluctuating incoherent component , @xmath26 arising from scales @xmath27 . @xmath28 the strategy will be to derive the dynamics of @xmath4 and @xmath29 while treating @xmath30 as a gaussian white noise with the statistics depending on the kolmogorov s energy dissipation rate @xmath31 as well as the instantaneous @xmath32 and @xmath8 .",
    "lagrangian dynamics is governed by @xmath33 and @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the random external force and @xmath36 is the pressure gradient , both properly differenced between the observation points .",
    "the dynamics of the coarse grained velocity gradient tensor , @xmath8 , and the tetrad tensor @xmath37 has the form :    @xmath38    with matrix @xmath39 .",
    "the left hand sides of ( [ 3a],[3b ] ) describe the self - advection and stretching of the tetrad by the coherent ( on the scale of @xmath40 ) component of the velocity field .",
    "the right hand side of ( [ 3a ] ) derives from the pressure gradient and the random force differences as well as from the coupling to incoherent small scale fluctuations .",
    "the @xmath41 term , with @xmath42 on the left hand side represents the  local  component of the pressure needed to insure conservation of @xmath43 as required by incompressibility .",
    "tensor @xmath44 is a measure of tetrad anisotropy representing the anisotropy of the lagrangian correlation volume built up by prior evolution @xcite .",
    "this choice of the local term , in contrast with the simpler , isotropic form @xcite is dictated by the requirement that the pressure forces should do no work and drop out of the energy balance ( see below ) .",
    "in addition it reintroduces proper reduction of the deterministic dynamics ( left hand side of ( [ 3a ] ) ) to 2d : i.e. a 2d velocity gradient configuration remains 2d provided that the tetrad has the shape of a filament , i.e. @xmath45 is a tensor of rank one .",
    "the remaining non - local part of the pressure is subsumed in @xmath46 .",
    "we now define the stochastic components of the model appearing on the right hand sides of ( 3a - b ) .",
    "it is appealing to model the non - local part of the pressure retained in @xmath47 , along with the contribution of small scales , as @xmath48-correlated gaussian random noise with the variance depending on the energy flux @xmath31 as well as the instantaneous @xmath32 and @xmath8 .",
    "let us consider a polynomial :    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is a random matrix , and @xmath51 a random function .",
    "the dimension of both @xmath47 and @xmath52 is time@xmath53 so that @xmath54 is a constant .",
    "the last term is clearly not the most general one can write .",
    "it is however the one suggested by the numerical study of the statistics of the right hand side of ( [ 3a ] ) , originally by borue and orszag @xcite .",
    "according to the dns the average @xmath46 conditioned on @xmath8 is not zero , but is reasonably well approximated by @xmath55 with @xmath56 , depending on the scale , at least for the isotropic tetrad ( i.e. @xmath57 .",
    "we shall assume that in the inertial range @xmath54 is constant ( which corresponds to keeping only the deterministic component of the 3d term in ( 4 ) ) and take it to be a model parameter .",
    "this @xmath54 term  renormalizes  the time scale of the deterministic dynamics described by the left hand side of the equation ( [ 3a ] ) and will have an important consequence for the energy transfer in the model , as we shall see shortly .",
    "let    @xmath58\\,\\delta ( t )   \\label{5a}\\ ] ]    which is the simplest form respecting incompressibility , with kolmogorov s energy flux @xmath31 and @xmath59 - a dimensionless parameter .",
    "random @xmath60 causes diffusion in velocity space ; note that @xmath31 has the dimension of corresponding diffusivity .",
    "the appearence of @xmath61 in ( 5a ) is further supported by the fact that @xmath62 fluctuations contribute to the energy transfer as we shall see below . in the  minimal  model , which we are now constructing",
    "we shall drop the possible multiplicative random field @xmath63 ( see eq.([4 ] ) ) .",
    "the fluctuations of the small scale@xcite @xmath30 can be resolved into parts which are longitudinal and transverse to @xmath19 : @xmath64 where with the k41 scaling in mind we take the characteristic time to be the ",
    "eddy turnover  time , @xmath65 .",
    "the longitudinal part of @xmath30 in the @xmath40-equation ( [ 3b ] ) would by itself produce richardson diffusion behavior , @xmath66 provided that the kolmogorov scaling @xmath67 holds .",
    "however , richardson diffusion would also arise from the non - gaussian coherent stretching term @xmath68 , and the gaussian longitudinal fluctuations , @xmath69 , do not appear to be essential .",
    "we shall set @xmath70 .",
    "the transverse fluctuations @xmath71 however are very important , because in their absence the effect of volume preserving coherent stretching would lead to the rapid growth of anisotropy of the tetrad .",
    "the incoherent transverse velocity fluctuations act to redistribute the vertices of the tetrad uniformly on the surface of the @xmath72 hyper - sphere in @xmath73 dimensions , thus introducing the isotropisation mechanism .",
    "the competition of the coherent stretching which leads to the growth of the radius of gyration @xmath74 ( both forward _ and backward _ in time ) and the isotropisation over the @xmath75 shell will play the key role in setting up the energy flux .",
    "the stochastic tetrad dynamics defined by eq .",
    "( 3 - 5 ) determines the lagrangian transition probability from tetrad @xmath76 to @xmath77 at a time @xmath78 later , @xmath79 , which satisfies a fokker - planck equation    @xmath80    with the evolution operator @xmath81    the invariant joint distribution , @xmath82 , satisfying @xmath83 can be interpreted as the eulerian pdf @xmath82 provided that the normalization @xmath84 is imposed @xcite .",
    "equations ( 7 - 8 ) once supplemented with the boundary condition specifying the eulerian pdf on the integral scale , @xmath85 , completely define our model .    before proceeding with the analysis of the fokker - planck equation ( 8) ,",
    "let us examine the energy balance , which was one of the key consideration in the formulation of the model : @xmath86 which is obtained by multiplying eq ( [ 8 ] ) by @xmath87 ( where @xmath88 ) and averaging with respect to @xmath89 .",
    "note that the average @xmath90 is taken at fixed @xmath40 and remains a function of it .",
    "the first two terms on the right hand side may be identified as the divergence of the large scale energy flux and the eddy damping respectively .",
    "note that the term originating from the deterministic component of the pressure @xmath91 drops out : the particular form of @xmath92 was chosen for that purpose on the grounds that the pressure gradients should not contribute to the energy transfer as seen in the von krmn - howarth derivation @xcite . however , since @xmath93 is only the coarse grained and not the full local velocity , in contrast with the von krmn - howarth analysis the divergence of the energy flux is balanced not directly by the viscous dissipation term , but by the eddy damping .",
    "there are also additional contributions due to the coupling with small scale fluctuations represented by the last three terms in ( [ 9 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath94 term represents the _ diffusive _ component of the energy flux arising from the small scale fluctuations and the coupling of the tetrad to the neighboring regions ( entering via gaussian @xmath50 ) .",
    "the @xmath95 term represents the transverse energy flux with : @xmath96   \\label{10}\\ ] ] which redistributes the energy within the @xmath97 shell , while the @xmath98 is the diffusive contribution to the eddy damping :    @xmath99\\right\\rangle \\,_{\\rho } .",
    "\\label{11a}\\ ] ]    this @xmath100 is reminiscent of the smagorinsky@xcite form of eddy damping ( popular in sub - grid simulations @xcite ) but with significant difference that in the latter the @xmath11-wave projector @xmath101 appearing in ( [ 11a ] ) is replaced by the simple scale factor @xmath74 .",
    "hence , in contrast with the smagorinsky model , our diffusive damping term is only active to the extent that the @xmath102 tensor is correlated with @xmath103 tensor within the @xmath74 shell .",
    "strictly speaking @xmath100 is not positive definite and its interpretation as the _ damping _ term is contingent on the expectation that the tetrad dynamics builds up the alignment of the principal axis of @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "notably , the deterministic eddy damping term which has appeared in ( [ 9 ] ) @xmath106 is a direct generalization of the so - called _ non - linear _ eddy damping @xmath107 advanced by bardina et al.@xcite and reduces to it for isotropic tetrads @xmath108 . in this limit @xmath109 , where @xmath110 and @xmath111 are respectively the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of @xmath8 .",
    "thus the energy transfer down scale is due to negative strain skewness or positive enstrophy production @xcite ( i.e. vortex stretching ) .",
    "we can define the energy flux by averaging over the fixed @xmath74 shells .",
    "let @xmath112 and @xmath113 denote the longitudinal velocity , then    @xmath114    is balanced by eddy damping @xmath115 . here",
    "@xmath116 denotes an additional average over @xmath117 shell .",
    "below we will often think of the diffusive contributions as being small compared to the non - linear interactions on current scale : that is , we shall assume @xmath118 and treat them as ( a singular ) perturbation of the deterministic dynamics .",
    "another tractable and perhaps physically more plausible limit is @xmath119 .",
    "note that the equation of the form ( [ 3a ] ) also governs the lagrangian evolution of the actual @xmath120 velocity gradient matrix @xmath121 ( we use lower case @xmath122 to avoid confusion with the coarse grained object )    @xmath123    as derives from the euler equation .",
    "lorat @xcite and vieillefosse @xcite have considered ( [ 13a ] ) retaining only the _ local _ and _ isotropic _ contribution to the pressure @xmath124 as a model of vorticity dynamics and observed that ( [ 13a],[13b ] ) leads to a finite time singularity with @xmath125 .",
    "the dynamics governed by ( [ 13a],[13b ] ) - the  restricted euler dynamics  , to use cantwell s terminology @xcite lies entirely in the two - dimensional phase space defined by the two invariants @xcite @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "this reduction stems from the @xmath128 invariance , @xmath129 with @xmath130 being an arbitrary @xmath18 matrix , which allows one to bring @xmath131 to diagonal form @xmath132 by a _",
    "time independent _ similarity transformation @xmath133 .",
    "there is yet one more independent constant of motion found by viellefosse@xcite : the  discriminant ",
    "@xmath134 , where @xmath135 are the ( in general complex ) eigenvalues of @xmath131 .",
    "the re dynamics thus reduces to 1d flow , i.e. it is integrable !",
    "figure 2 shows the flow in the 2d phase plane of the cantwell s invariants @xcite @xmath136 , @xmath137 and the finite time singularity corresponds to the @xmath138 , @xmath139 asymptotically approaching the @xmath140 separatrix .    along the @xmath140 separatrix",
    "the flow is particularly simple :    @xmath141    with @xmath142 making the finite time singularity at @xmath143 explicit .",
    "the region above the separatrix , @xmath144 , is elliptic : the eigenvalues of the velocity gradient eigenvalues become complex and the lagrangian trajectories are rotating ; the region below the separatrix , @xmath145 , is hyperbolic : the eigenvalues are real and the trajectories are strain dominated .",
    "these topological aspects of re dynamics were emphasized by blackburn et al@xcite .    as a model of finite time singularity",
    "re solutions were rejected@xcite on the reasonable ground that if considered as global solutions of euler equations these do not satisfy sensible boundary conditions and have unbounded energy .",
    "ashurst et al@xcite however noted that the statistics of the vorticity / strain alignment observed in the dns of navier - stokes may be qualitatively understood in terms of re .",
    "subsequently cantwell and coworkers @xcite proceeded to investigate the dns generated statistics of @xmath146 invariants and observed that the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of @xmath147 exhibits a pronounced tail along the viellefosse @xmath140 asymptote as can be seen on fig.3 .",
    "these two observations suggest that despite the draconian local and isotropic approximation to pressure and the unphysical finite time singularity the re dynamics does capture certain statistical features of the physical flow .    the deterministic part of the lagrangian tetrad dynamics defined in section 2 generalizes re by reinterpreting the velocity gradient tensor as a coarse - grained field defined over the tetrad @xmath32 and completing the lagrangian picture by adding the dynamical equation for @xmath148 .",
    "the @xmath32 field introduces the measure of current length scale and the dependence on the history of the strain which controls the  shape  of the tetrad .",
    "the @xmath32-dynamics ( [ 3b ] ) is coupled to @xmath8 *  * via the anisotropy tensor @xmath149 .",
    "for an isotropic tetrad ( i.e. regular tetrahedron ) @xmath150 and the @xmath151-dynamics ( the left hand side of ( [ 3a ] ) ) reduces instantaneously to re equation ( [ 13a],[13b ] ) . in the next instant",
    "however the tetrad will become distorted through the action of the volume preserving @xmath8 following the @xmath40-dynamics equation ( left hand side of ( [ 3b ] ) ) and the trajectory will come out of the re plane .",
    "its evolution will depart from re as the anisotropy increases and at some point the growth of @xmath152 will be cut off .",
    "this is most easily seen for the @xmath140 vieillefosse line .",
    "the dynamics of @xmath153 ( see ( [ 14 ] ) ) becomes @xmath154 , with @xmath155 where @xmath156 evolves according to @xmath157 .",
    "the isotropic tetrad corresponds to @xmath158 .",
    "starting from isotropy and @xmath159 both @xmath160 and @xmath161 grow .",
    "the growth of @xmath162 corresponds to the contraction of one of the principle axis of the @xmath104 tensor as the tetrad is flattened in a pancake .",
    "however when @xmath163 the growth of @xmath164 reverses .",
    "thus , anisotropy caused by the stretching of the tetrad cuts off the viellefosse finite time singularity@xcite .",
    "the modified re dynamics however retains the initial growth of @xmath8 with two expanding and one contracting strain directions and the consequent deformation of the tetrad into a pancake or ribbon.@xcite this process is the fundamental step of energy transfer@xcite . in the next section",
    "we will see that the viellefosse tail ( large @xmath165 region ) of the cantwell pdf on fig.3 which is generated through this process , indeed corresponds to large negative strain skewness associated with the energy transfer @xcite .",
    "another retained aspect of the re dynamics is the evolution of the vorticity / strain alignment from configurations where vorticity is parallel to @xmath54-strain ( i.e. the fast stretching direction ) to configuration where vorticity is aligned with the intermediate , @xmath166-strain as observed numerically@xcite .",
    "the new feature of the modified model is that while in the isotropic re all 2d configurations of @xmath8 evolve into 3d , ( e.g. @xmath167 will in the next instant acquire , due to low local pressure , a contracting component of strain acting along the @xmath168-direction which will act to destroy @xmath169 ) , the new anisotropic model allows the @xmath170 configurations of @xmath8 to persist provided that the @xmath171 tensor is rank two ( @xmath104 rank one ) which correspond to filament like tetrads .",
    "note that both intense vorticity and quasi - one dimensional tetrads will be produced by the action of strain with one stretching and two contracting directions @xmath172>0 $ ] , thus there potentially is a chance of describing vortex ",
    "we shall return to the discussion of the kinematics of energy transfer and vortex stretching in section 5 .",
    "how can one compare the deterministic tetrad dynamics model with the real navier - stokes dynamics ?",
    "the relevant empirical object is the average @xmath173 and @xmath174 conditioned on @xmath8 , @xmath32 but to simplify matters we will restrict to isotropic tetrads and examine the flow in the @xmath175 phase space generated by the conditional averages @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",

    "our code is fully de - aliased .",
    "we used up to @xmath178 collocation grid points , and the effective resolution was maintained to be higher than @xmath179 , where @xmath180 is the highest wave - vector in the simulation , and @xmath181 the kolmogorov length scale ( @xmath182 ) .",
    "statistics were accumulated for at least @xmath183 eddy turnover times . in the following ,",

    "the latter were increasing from the dissipation range to large scale .",
    "for isotropic @xmath32 our @xmath8-dynamics is instantaneously tangent to the re and therefore the empirical flows can be compared with fig .",
    "remarkably , while there are significant deviations in the topology of the flow for @xmath40 in the dissipative range ( fig.4a ) , the instantaneous flow for large scale @xmath40 is surprisingly close to re .",
    "the deviations at small scales are presumably due to the viscous effects .",
    "the conditional flow for @xmath189 can be fitted by the modified re : @xmath190 with @xmath54 decreasing with increasing @xmath191 from .8 to 0 . for the reasons related to the energy transfer , discussed in section 2 , we believe that @xmath54 should be constant in the inertial range . the continuous scale dependence observed in the fit to dns however is not unexpected , because the inertial range at the accessible @xmath192 is quite limited . on the other hand the approximate validity of ( [ 15 ] ) as a description of the coarse - grained lagrangian evolution is quite encouraging .",
    "it would be important to extend the comparison of the deterministic dynamics ( [ 15 ] ) with the numerical simulation for anisotropic tetrads , however in that case the sl(3 ) invariance of ( [ 15 ] ) is lost and in addition to the @xmath147 invariants the time derivative must be conditioned on the vorticity , which makes the computation more demanding statistically .",
    "it would also be important to investigate systematically the deviations of the conditional flow from ( [ 15 ] ) : these are expected to arise from the possible additional deterministic terms in ( [ 15 ] ) ( e.g. @xmath193 ) as well as the stochastic dynamics .",

    "let us compute the distribution in @xmath146 plane of the average enstrophy @xmath261 and enstrophy production @xmath262 which measures the rate of vortex stretching@xcite .",
    "the enstrophy density is defined by @xmath263 but in order to save computer time will only be evaluated in the saddle approximation by varying the integrand w.r.t .",
    "@xmath264 . for all of the hyperbolic region",
    "the saddle of the integral occurs at a non - zero values of @xmath265 parameters ( [ 22a],[22b ] ) .",
    "the result is presented in fig.7 .",
    "we see that the average enstrophy peaks at @xmath266 and small positive @xmath267 .",

    "the average enstrophy production @xmath273 is also dominated by a non - trivial saddle and has the @xmath146 dependence shown in fig.8 .",
    "we observe that enstrophy is produced predominantly in the upper left quadrant of the @xmath146 plane , it is ( partially ) destroyed in the upper right quadrant and there is weak vortex stretching in the @xmath140 tail .",
    "the tail region is not well resolved on fig.8 and the positive enstrophy production is confined to the narrow strip delineated by the zero contours .",
    "this strip becomes progressively more and more narrow as one looks at smaller scales , @xmath274 , ( which is why we limited our figures to rather large @xmath275 ) however , the existence of positive vortex stretching in the tail domain was verified analytically via the arguments presented later in this section ( and in appendix a ) .",
    "next we compute the average strain skewness , @xmath276 , which is the object associated with energy transfer @xcite , and find that it is strongly localized in the @xmath140 vieillefosse tail as shown in fig.9 .",

    "note that the energy transfer term in ( [ 9 ] ) is actually @xmath277 so that vortex stretching also contributes to the energy flux.@xcite vortex stretching however does not dominate the energy transfer : while most of the enstrophy production is in the upper left quadrangle , fig.8 , the energy flux distribution @xmath278 is localized in the @xmath140 tail where the negative @xmath279 lives , see fig.10 .",
    "thus we arrive at the conclusion that from the energy transfer point of view , the active regions are dominated by the strain and not vorticity @xcite . also of interest is the appearance of distinct regions of weak _ negative _ energy transfer : e.g. the @xmath280 quadrangle where both @xmath281 and the energy flux are negative@xcite .    remarkably , as seen from the comparison of fig.7 - 10 and figs .",
    "11 - 14 the dns exhibits a rather similar distribution of average enstrophy , enstrophy production and strain skewness in the @xmath175 plane .",
    "both dns and the model have positive enstrophy production in the upper left quadrant and in the @xmath140 , @xmath256 tail , and negative @xmath282 in the upper right quadrangle ; both have strain skewness strongly confined to the @xmath140 , @xmath256 tail , and both exhibit the dominance of the strain skewness in the energy transfer .",
    "furthermore , there is a clear correspondence of the positive and negative regions of @xmath283 ( fig.9 and 13 ) and energy flux ( fig.10 and 14 ) .",
    "much of this behavior can be understood by considering the  statistical geometry  of the flow ( see ashurst et al@xcite , constantin @xcite and tsinober et al@xcite for excellent discussions ) and is inherited from the re dynamics .",
    "most of the vortex stretching occurs for @xmath284 where the vorticity is aligned with the large positive eigenvector of the strain ; this is immediately evident from the structure of the @xmath8 matrix at the saddle point controlling @xmath285 :    @xmath286    where@xcite@xmath287 , since the off - diagonal elements of ( 24 ) define the vorticity along the direction with the strain eigenvalue @xmath288 .",
    "the tetrad dynamics then takes the @xmath8 field into the @xmath289 region where @xmath153 and hence the stretching rate @xmath281 vanish before changing sign .",

    "@xmath8 tensor has the form : @xmath290 with @xmath291 and @xmath292 , so that the flow is essentially two dimensional with vorticity aligned with the nearly neutral strain direction .    the alignment of intense vorticity with the intermediate strain axis is well known @xcite and its reappearance in the model is encouraging .",
    "the fate of the typical @xmath170 vorticity is to implode under the action of the contracting strain ( brought about by the low pressure of the vortex ) @xcite .",
    "the energy is transfered to larger scale . to conclude we examine the geometry of @xmath8 in the @xmath140 tail . here",
    "the predominant @xmath8 configuration is @xmath293 which leads to the strain eigenvalues @xmath294 and @xmath295 .",

    "the most probable configurations have @xmath302 and are close to plane shear or @xmath170 vorticity .",
    "note that these most probable configurations have @xmath303 or @xmath304 which means approximate @xmath120 homogeneity - a much stronger statement than the homogeneity on average , i.e. @xmath305 ! this must have serious implications for the pressure .",
    "the exagerated non - gaussianity ( i.e. vieillefosse tail ) of the deterministic model aside , there are also other qualitative differences between the results of the model and the dns : e.g. the vorticity density in the dns peaks at the origin and is skewed in the upper half plane , towards @xmath306 .",
    "this effect is even stronger for the vorticity distribution measured in the dissipative range : an asymmetry also visible in @xmath272 shown on fig.3a .",
    "this can be understood as a result of enstrophy dissipation by viscosity which shifts the locus of null enstrophy growth and hence maximal enstrophy to configurations where of vorticity is still aligned with positive strain .",
    "let us further explore the results of the deterministic approximation .",
    "the exact solution on the @xmath140 line ( see appendix a ) exhibits strong asymmetry : even though the pdf is gaussian along the @xmath140 line both for @xmath256 and @xmath306 , @xmath307 the characteristic exponents on the two sides are different , @xmath308 .",
    "it is the @xmath309 exponent which controls the behavior of low moments including the 3d and in order to impose constant energy flux we must require @xmath310 which forces k41 scaling on the  head  of the pdf in fig.5a , b .",
    "the constant flux condition thus fixes a specific relation ( determined in the appendix a ) between the model parameters : as @xmath166 increases from 0 to @xmath311 , @xmath54 decreases from @xmath312 to 0 .    however , while the scaling in the bulk of the pdf is k41 , the scaling in the vieillefosse tail is anomalous . introducing rescaled variable @xmath313 , @xmath314 , and @xmath315",
    "we find that the @xmath316 dependence of the action in the hyperbolic vicinity of the tail ( which determines its width in the @xmath146 plane ) has the asymptotic form : @xmath317 where the scaling function @xmath318 and @xmath319 for @xmath320 with @xmath321 .",
    "similarly , the vorticity distribution on the @xmath140 ( @xmath256 ) line is governed asymptotically by @xmath322 where @xmath323 for @xmath324 and @xmath325 for @xmath320 with @xmath326 .",
    "the anomalous exponents depend on @xmath166 : @xmath327 varies from 0 at @xmath328 , ( @xmath329 ) to 1/2 at @xmath330 , @xmath331 . over the same range",
    "@xmath50 varies from 1 to 3/2 .",
    "the exponents as a function of @xmath166 are tabulated in the appendix a it follows that the conditional enstrophy in the vieillefosse tail behaves for large @xmath153 as : @xmath332 implying an interesting non - trivial scaling relation between the strain and vorticity of the velocity gradient sheets associated with the high energy transfer regions .",
    "we can also compute the contribution of the @xmath140 , @xmath256 tail to the monts of the velocity gradient .",
    "e.g. we compute @xmath333 where the normalization factor @xmath334 because it is dominated by the ",
    "head  of the pdf with k41 scaling , already factorized explicitly .",
    "thus we conclude that the tail contribution is important only for sufficiently large @xmath335 , when @xmath336 and the anomalous scaling becomes dominant over the normal contribution of the bulk of the pdf .",
    "we find that in the limit of @xmath337 and @xmath338 , @xmath339 and the shape of the pdf , although non - gaussian , becomes independent of the scale .",
    "this limit recovers the kolmogorov 41 theory .",
    "the intermittency effect is maximized as @xmath340 and @xmath341 , where anomalous scaling appears for @xmath342 .",
    "it is clear that although the pdf found in the present deterministic approximation of the model is on the whole far from gaussian ( imposed on integral scale ) the approximation underestimates the intermittency effects . e.g.",
    "it predicts no deviations from k41 in the vorticity dominated @xmath270 region , in contrast to the dns result which in that region exhibits @xmath230-dependence associated with the development of an exponential ( or sub - exponential ) tail on smaller scales .",
    "it is equally clear that the description of such a tail is beyond the currently employed approximation .",
    "after all , the asymptotic behavior of the pdf , i.e. the statistics of large fluctuations , is dominated by fluctuations .",
    "one does however expect to find the exponential asymptotics @xcite once the fluctuations are accounted for via a proper semi - classical calculation .",
    "there thus appears to be two mechanisms contributing to the intermittency : 1 ) the deterministic non - linear interactions in the energy transfer region as indicated by our present calculation and 2 ) the effect of small scale fluctuations responsible for the exponential asymptotics of the pdf .",
    "the latter mechanism is analogous to the one responsible for the intermittency of the passive scalar@xcite .",
    "in the preceding sections we have introduced and began to analyze the phenomenological model of inertial scale velocity fluctuations defined through the velocity gradient tensor coarse - grained over a region specified by a tetrad of points .",
    "the dynamics of this field was decomposed into the non - linear deterministic component representing local same - scale interactions and a gaussian stochastic component with embedded k41 scaling representing interactions non - local in space and the incoherent contribution of the velocity fluctuations from scales smaller than that of the tetrad .",
    "the deterministic component is closely related to the re dynamics of vieillefosse @xcite model .",
    "the latter , although marred by the unphysical finite time singularity , @xcitehas been an appealing candidate description for the dynamics of the local velocity gradient @xcite .",
    "a novel aspect of our model is the elevation of the velocity gradient dynamics to the coarse - grained level and the introduction of the tetrad tensor ( @xmath32 ) dynamics which explicitly introduces the scale and the measure of anisotropy generated through the strain induced distortion of the lagrangian volume .",
    "this allows to construct an anisotropic model of the coarse grained pressure hessian which eliminates the finite time singularity from the deterministic dynamics by suppressing the work done by the pressure on the distorted fluid element .",
    "furthermore , the explicit appearance of the current scale allows to build in k41 spectrum in the stochastic component @xcite of the dynamics .",
    "an important reason for working with the coarse grained field is that in the dynamics of the purely inertial range fields the direct contribution of the viscosity can be neglected @xcite . instead",
    ", the ultimately viscous dissipation is incorporated through the effect of the incoherent small scales acting through the eddy damping @xmath343 terms in the model .",
    "the deterministic dynamics plays the key role in transferring energy down scale .",
    "this transfer occurs due to the volume preserving distortion of the fluid element which leads to the reduction of at least one of its principle axis .",
    "our heuristic derivation of the model was fortified by the numerical test of ( [ 3a ] ) through the construction of the conditional flow for the invariants of @xmath8 .",
    "the deterministic part of ( 3a ) appears to be quite close to the conditional flow at least for isotropic tetrads @xmath344",
    ". it will be important to extend the numerical study to anisotropic @xmath40 and to find a way of examining the stochastic contribution to the dynamics .",
    "the validity of the local approximation of the pressure hessian @xcite and the neglect of non - local correlations remain the key issues .    the tetrad model respects k41 scaling ( @xmath345 , @xmath346 ) , both on the operator ( [ 7 ] ) and the integral scale boundary condition ( [ 16 ] ) levels .",
    "yet , as illustrated by our crude deterministic approximation the resulting pdf has non - trivial , model parameter dependent anomalous scaling .",
    "the kolmogorov scaling has to be re - imposed on the level of the 3d moment by choosing the parameters so as to make the energy flux scale independent . except for one particular limit ( @xmath337 , @xmath347 ) where the pdf has k41 behavior ,",
    "high moments exhibit anomalous scaling .",
    "remarkably , while this anomalous scaling has little to do with the kolmogorov - obukhov arguments @xcite it does originate in the domain of energy transfer : the vieillefosse tail .",
    "the deterministic approximation employed in section 5 grossly overestimates the extent of the vieillefosse tail in @xmath253 but it does bear resemblance to the pdf observed in the dns .",
    "it also generates plausible distributions of enstrophy , enstrophy production and strain skewness .",
    "the present analysis provides a clear dissection of the high enstrophy and the high enstrophy production regions , identifies the difference in the vorticity- strain alignment in the two regions @xcite and exhibits their dynamical connection . as explained in section 3 , much of this sensible phenomenology was inherited from the re dynamics @xcite .",
    "the elimination of the vieillefosse finite time singularity was however essential in order to have a model with stationary statistics .",
    "the energy transfer for isotropic @xmath40 configurations occurs via non - linear eddy damping @xcite @xmath348 term ( [ 9 ] ) , which combines contributions of strain skewness and vortex stretching . within our present crude deterministic approximation ,",
    "the energy transfer occurs largely in the viellefosse tail and is due to large negative @xmath349 . in this region strain",
    "has two positive eigenvalues and lagrangian volumes are deformed into pancakes or ribbons , i.e. this is the region of sheet formation @xcite . in contrast , the vortex filaments are generated in the @xmath350 quadrant where enstrophy production is peaked .",
    "this region does not contribute as much to the energy flux .",
    "furthermore , the maximal vorticity region is characterized by nearly @xmath170 configurations and does not contribute at all - a notion consistent with recent numerical results @xcite . yet , whereas we are optimistic about correct description of the high @xmath351 tail in the model , the correct description of the high @xmath281 region may be more difficult because of the importance of long - range strain in vortex stretching .",
    "in order to enable a more quantitative comparison of the model and the dns the treatment of the model must include the effect of the fluctuations which control the asymptotic behavior of the pdf . our present , deterministic , approximation overestimates the pdf in the narrow vieillefosse tail , while underestimating the asymptotic behavior of the pdf elsewhere in the @xmath175 plane .",
    "both effects are due to the neglect of the fluctuations .",
    "since the relevant fokker - planck equation lives in the @xmath352 dimensional @xmath8 , *  * @xmath40 space the direct numerical approach seems out of question .",
    "however one may hope to make progress with the semi - classical analysis of the path integral representation ( [ 20 ] ) along the lines of @xcite .",
    "this approach is valid for the calculation of the pdf tails and associated anomalous scaling .",
    "we expect that the fluctuation effects will change the gaussian decay of the pdf tails found in the deterministic approximation to the exponential,@xcite e.g. : @xmath353 .",
    "an interesting simplification appears in the limit of strong transverse diffusion @xmath354 which corresponds to the physically sensible regime of strong re - isotropisation of the tetrads arising from the action of incoherent small scale fluctuations . in that limit",
    "the pdf becomes nearly uniform over the @xmath97 shells and can be projected onto the @xmath355 and @xmath11 representations of @xmath356 acting on @xmath19 : @xmath357    curiously , this nearly isotropic approximation doubles as a @xmath358 expansion @xcite because the @xmath11-wave mode of @xmath359 is suppressed by the @xmath360 total angular momentum factor with @xmath361 .",
    "this expansion allows a considerable simplification of ( [ 7 ] ) and ( [ 20 ] ) .",
    "several related models are worth mentioning .",
    "the present model appears to be the real space , lagrangian counterpart of the momentum space , eulerian  shell  model proposed by siggia @xcite .",
    "yet , the geometrical and statistical implications of that model have not been fully explored and we do not at present understand the relative merits of the assumptions involved in the two models .",
    "the logic which led to ( [ 3a],[3b ] ) can and has been applied to the passive scalar problem , in which case one would replace @xmath8 by a gaussian random field .",
    "this would lead to a ps model of the type considered in @xcite closely related to the kraichnan s @xcite model .",
    "it would be interesting also to explore whether the 2d version of ( [ 3a],[3b ] ) could provide a sensible description of 2d turbulence where the physics is very different . in that case the deterministic left hand side of ( [ 3a ] ) would vanish for isotropic  triads  .",
    "we do not presently know if the model can generate the inverse cascade . finally ,",
    "if the tetrad model provides a reasonable description of turbulent fluctuations in the homogeneous case , it will be interesting to attempt to generalize it to the inhomogeneous and anisotropic case : e.g. one could study the statistics of tetrads moving away from the wall in the boundary layer .",
    "last but not least , two remarks concerning the relation with the experiment .",
    "the traditional approach to turbulence and most of the existing data involves velocity difference at two points .",
    "this two point statistics can be extracted from the tetrad statistics by averaging over  unobserved ",
    "variables @xmath362 .",
    "conversely , it would be very interesting to study tetrad statistics experimentally . for",
    "that we need a velocity measurement at 4 points in the inertial range , which can be obtained from 3 ( crossed wire ) probes ( say a fixed probe at the origin and two movable probes at @xmath363 in a flow with @xmath364 .",
    "the time lag ( on the static probe ) then can be used to provide the 4th measurement @xcite .",
    "the pdf coarse grained velocity gradient may then be obtained . quite independently of the predictions of the present model , the @xmath186-plane density of the 2nd and 3d order invariants ( e.g. figs .",
    "8 - 14 ) are quite illuminating in dissecting the role of vorticity and strain in intermittency and the possible difference in their anomalous scaling .",
    "we conclude finally that despite its relative simplicity the tetrad model is surprisingly rich in physics , offering an insight both into the geometry and dynamics as well as the statistical and scaling properties of the inertial range fields .",
