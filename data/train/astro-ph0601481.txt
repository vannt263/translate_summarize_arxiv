    "observation of the temperature anisotropies of the cmb directly constrain the curvature perturbation somewhat before cosmological scales re - enter the horizon .",
    "current observations show that the curvature perturbation is gaussian with a scale - invariant spectrum to within experimental limits , which is consistent with the predictions of inflation .",
    "nevertheless , some nongaussianity is expected to be generated during inflation @xcite-@xcite ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "it is interesting to study the level of nongaussianity , usually parameterized by a dimensionless nonlinearity parameter @xmath0 , in various scenarios for inflation , since it can be an important way to discriminate between different models .",
    "for example , the curvaton mechanism @xcite for the generation of cosmological perturbations may be ruled out by future non - observation of nongaussianity @xcite ( see , however , @xcite ) .",
    "one way to generate significant levels of nongaussianity at the end of inflation is by preheating @xcite-@xcite .",
    "preheating refers to the nonperturbative production of particles which arises either due to coherent oscillations @xcite or tachyonic ( spinodal ) instability @xcite-@xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it has also been suggested that preheating might affect the first order variation of the curvature perturbation , perhaps dominating the contribution of the inflaton and thus modifying the standard predictions of inflation @xcite-@xcite .    in this paper",

    "see @xcite for constraints on the parameter space of hybrid inflation coming from the wmap data . during hybrid inflation",
    "the inflaton field @xmath6 is displaced from its preferred value , and inflation is driven by the false vacuum energy of the `` waterfall '' or tachyon field @xmath7 which is trapped in its false vacuum by interactions with the inflaton . when the inflaton reaches some critical value the tachyon effective mass squared becomes negative and its fluctuations grow exponentially due to the spinodal instability .",
    "the exponential growth continues until the fluctuations of the tachyon start to oscillate about the true vaccuum . at this stage",
    "the tachyon fluctuations become nonperturbative and their back - reaction brings inflation to an end . here",
    "we study the evolution of the second - order curvature perturbation due to the tachyonic instability and find that it can lead to a large level of nongaussianity , if the tachyon was lighter than the hubble scale @xmath8 , during a sufficient part of the inflationary epoch .",
    "( if @xmath9 , the fluctuations of @xmath7 are exponentially suppressed during inflation . ) in the hybrid inflation model , it can be natural to have @xmath8 during inflation , since @xmath10 changes sign at the end of inflation .",
    "if the inflaton is rolling slowly enough , @xmath10 will naturally already be close to zero even before the end of inflation , at the time of horizon crossing .",
    "the scenario is summarized as follows . during inflation the squared mass of the tachyon field",
    "varies linearly with the number of e - foldings of inflation , in the vicinity of the point where it passes through zero : @xmath11 , taking @xmath12 to be the value where @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is a function of the parameters of hybrid inflation .",
    "inflation starts at some @xmath15 , and ends at @xmath16 , for a total of @xmath17 e - foldings .",
    "we are going to limit our inquiry to regions of parameter space where the linear behavior of @xmath18 is valid during the full duration of inflation , since this technical assumption makes the calculations tractable ; however we will show that this assumption must often be satisfied anyway , as a consequence of the experimental limit on the inflationary spectral index . at @xmath12 ,",
    "fluctuations of the tachyon field start to grow exponentially , and can make a large contribution to the curvature perturbation at second order in cosmological perturbation theory , resulting in a scale - noninvariant component both in the cmb temperature power spectrum , and its nongaussian correlations .",

    "if they agree to set up perturbations with small wavelengths in their hubble patches at the end of inflation , this will induce large - scale correlations between different hubble patches .",
    "since the tachyon field is synchronized across these different hubble patches it is able to amplify the large - scale perturbations in a coherent way .",
    "one avenue for future study is the more realistic class of models where @xmath7 is complex and the defects which form are cosmic strings instead of domain walls .",
    "however , this is a much more technically difficult model to study than the case of the real scalar . in the latter case ,",
