    "the study of relativistic fluids with spin has a long history . among the early major contributors to the subject are mathisson @xcite and weyssenhoff @xcite .",
    "the latter formulated a model enforcing the condition of vanishing projection of the spin density tensor over the four - velocity field , namely : @xmath6 also known as _",
    "frenkel condition_. this auxiliary constraint onto the fluid motion did not seem justified by established physical principles and for a system of pointlike relativistic massive particles in general does not apply @xcite .",
    "this condition was in fact critically reexamined in a later work by bohm and vigier @xcite where they proposed to extend the theory to a more general motion allowing the four - vector @xmath7 , yet without obtaining a conclusive quantitative formulation .",
    "a major step in formulating a theory of relativistic fluid with spin was made in 1960 by f. halbwachs @xcite who worked out a lagrangian variational approach , yet keeping the frenkel condition as auxiliary equation of motion .",
    "the hydrodynamics of relativistic fluids with spin has since become the subject of specialized literature in general relativity @xcite , especially in the framework of einstein - cartan gravity theory @xcite .",
    "most of these studies assume the frenkel condition ( [ frenkel ] ) , which implies a considerable simplification in the calculations .",
    "since this condition , as has been mentioned , does not derive from any major physical principle , it would be interesting to test it in a simple situation .    indeed , a system which allows to perform a theoretical independent test exists : the macroscopic ideal spinning gas of particles with spin at full thermodynamical equilibrium .",
    "the condition of full thermodynamical equilibrium implies that this study can be carried out within the framework of statistical mechanics , independently of any previous formulation of a hydrodynamical theory and freely from the danger of begging the question .",
    "one of us studied in a previous work @xcite the physics of the ideal rotating relativistic gas of particles with spin ( in the boltzmann statistics ) at full thermodynamical equilibrium obtaining the expression of the polarization four - vector and momentum spectra . in this paper",
    ", we resume that study and derive the local expression of all thermodynamical quantities for this system seen as a fluid .",
    "particularly , we will obtain the expression of the spin tensor and the spin density tensor and show that the latter enters in the general thermodynamical equation relating proper entropy density , proper energy density and pressure , coupled to the acceleration tensor .",
    "the nature of this additional term , which has been already extensively used in the aforementioned works @xcite , is that of a quantum correction to thermodynamics owing to the presence of spin as a further degree of freedom of particles .",
    "we will provide the expression of the single - particle spin - dependent phase space density showing that it is a non - diagonal matrix in spin coordinates .",
    "we will finally demonstrate that even for this simple system ( indeed the simplest among all possible relativistic fluids ) the four - vector @xmath8 defined in ( [ frenkel ] ) is non - vanishing , thus violating the frenkel condition .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "[ eqgas ] we summarize and further explain the main results obtained in the work @xcite . in sect .",
    "[ fluid ] we calculate the local thermodynamical densities of the rotating gas viewed as a macroscopic fluid . in sect .",
    "[ angvel ] we introduce and derive the angular velocity tensor for a rotating fluid and in sect .",
    "[ spin ] the spin tensor showing its proportionality to the acceleration tensor . in sect .",
    "[ accel ] we briefly take the viewpoint of the accelerated fluid cell in the rotating gas .    throughout this work , we will confine our attention to a special relativistic fluid , i.e. we will disregard gravitational effects and assume a flat minkowski spacetime .      in this paper",
    "we adopt the natural units , with @xmath9 .",
    "+ the minkowskian metric tensor is @xmath10 ; for the levi - civita symbol we use the convention @xmath11 .",
    "+ we will use the relativistic notation with repeated greek indices assumed to be saturated .",
    "contractions will also be denoted by a dot for both vectors and tensors ; the saturated index in a contraction between a vector and a rank 2 tensor is specified by the position of the vector , either on the left or right .",
    "double contraction of rank 2 tensors @xmath12 and @xmath13 will also be denoted by a colon , i.e. @xmath14 .",
    "+ space - time linear transformations ( translations , rotations , boosts ) and sl(2,c ) transformations are written in serif font , e.g. @xmath15 , @xmath16 ; @xmath17 $ ] will denote the lorentz or sl(2,c ) transformation taking the timelike vector @xmath18 to four - momentum @xmath19 .",
    "operators in hilbert space will be denoted by an upper hat , e.g. @xmath20 .",
    "unit vectors will be denoted with a smaller hat e.g. @xmath21 ; even though the notation is unambiguous , we will make explicit mention of either possibility whenever confusion may arise .",
    "a macroscopic system with given angular momentum at complete thermodynamical equilibrium can only have a rigid velocity field : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a constant vector , as seen from the inertial system where the system is at rest .",
    "this is a simple consequence of enforcing statistical equilibrium and is a well known result for non - relativistic systems @xcite which can be easily extended to relativistic ones with the additional bound @xmath24 ( see appendix b in ref .",
    "obviously , for an isolated system , @xmath23 can be constant only if it is directed along one of the system s principal axes .",
    "hence , thermodynamical equilibrium of a rotating body requires @xmath23 to be parallel to @xmath25 and , therefore , that the system s shape is symmetric for rotation around @xmath23 .",
    "the whole physics of an equilibrated system with finite angular momentum @xmath25 , chemical potential @xmath26 and temperature @xmath27 is fully contained in the density operator @xmath28 : @xmath29     \\pro_{\\bf j } \\pro_v\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the quantum wigner projector onto a given state @xmath31 : @xmath32 @xmath33 is the partition function : @xmath34 \\pro_{\\bf j } \\pro_v\\ ] ] and @xmath35 is the projector onto _ localized states _",
    "@xmath36 @xmath37 which form a complet set of quantum states for the system in its finite region @xmath38 . in a first quantization scheme ,",
    "these states are a complete set of functions which vanish outside the domain @xmath38 .",
    "on the other hand , in a quantum field theory , there are some complications which have been discussed extensively in refs .",
    "@xcite , yet they do not essentially modify the first - quantization scenario ( see also appendix a ) .",
    "the density operator ( [ denmat1 ] ) defines a grand - canonical ensemble with fixed angular momentum .",
    "if both @xmath38 and @xmath25 are large , it can be shown @xcite that this ensemble is equivalent ( at least for first moments of statistical distributions ) to the _ rotational grand - canonical ensemble _ whose density operator reads : @xmath39 \\pro_v\\ ] ] being @xmath23 the angular velocity vector and @xmath40 the relevant partition function : @xmath41 \\pro_v\\ ] ] the transition from ( [ denmat1 ] ) to ( [ denmat2 ] ) , or from ( [ zj ] ) to ( [ zomega ] ) can be carried out through a large @xmath42 limit of the wigner rotation matrices in ( [ wigner ] ) and a subsequent saddle - point expansion in the angular variables defining the su(2 ) parameters in the integral ( [ wigner ] ) ; for details see refs .  @xcite . for studying macroscopic rotating systems ,",
    "the ensemble ( [ denmat2 ] ) is thus the most natural choice .",
    "it can be shown that indeed , as long as @xmath43 , the partition function ( [ zomega ] ) can be written as the product of grand - canonical partition functions of infinitesimal cells moving with a velocity ( [ rigid ] ) , according to the general wisdom that equilibrated macroscopic systems must be rigidly rotating .",
    "it is worth showing this in some detail for an ideal relativistic gas of massive particles with spin @xmath44 in the limit of boltzmann statistics , i.e. considering particle as distinguishable objects . in this case , we can simply write the partition function ( [ zomega ] ) as a product of single - particle partition functions and the calculation of ( [ zomega ] ) in fact reduces to compute matrix elements of single - particle compatible operators @xmath45 , like this : @xmath46 \\pro_v { |p , \\sigma\\rangle } =    { { \\rm e}}^{-\\varepsilon / t + \\mu q / t } { \\langle p,\\tau| } \\exp[{\\boldsymbol{\\omega}}\\cdot \\widehat { \\bf j}/t ] \\pro_v { |p , \\sigma\\rangle}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 and @xmath48 label polarization states .",
    "we follow the convention in @xcite , where they are defined as eigenvalues of the projection of the pauli - lubanski vector divided by the mass onto the third space - like four - vector orthogonal to the particle four - momentum . for more details",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite . ]",

    "( [ matel1 ] ) can be calculated by means of an analytical prolongation from imaginary @xmath50 values . after replacing @xmath51 with @xmath52",
    "we have a rotation @xmath53 around the axis @xmath23 of an angle @xmath54 appearing in the eq .",
    "( [ matel1 ] ) .",
    "we can then expand the matrix element on the right hand side as : @xmath55 note that this expansion would have been impossible for the operator @xmath56 $ ] itself because , for real @xmath50 , all its matrix elements calculated with momentum eigenstates turn out to be infinite . in other words , the correct procedure to make the analytic continuation of the matrix element is ,",
    "first , go to imaginary @xmath50 values and thereafter insert an identity resolution like in ( [ matel2 ] ) .",
    "the matrix element of the representation of a rotation is well known ; it involves a dirac s delta and a wigner rotation matrix : @xmath57^{-1 } { \\sf r}_{\\hat { \\boldsymbol{\\omega}}}(\\phi )   [ p'])_{\\tau \\sigma'}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 $ ] is defined as a lorentz transformation ( in fact its sl(2,c ) correspondant ) taking the timelike vector @xmath58 to @xmath19 and @xmath59 denotes , as usual , the ( 2s+1)-dimensional sl(2,c ) representation ( what is commonly labelled as the ( s,0 ) in fact ) .",
    "obtaining the matrix element of the projector @xmath35 over momentum eigenstates is not so straightforward .",

    "the formula ( [ prov ] ) gives the correct infinite volume limit @xmath62 , that is the momentum eigenstate normalization .",
    "for finite volumes , a striking feature is the presence of non - trivial matrix elements in spin coordinates ; their particular form can be justified also by requiring @xmath35 to commute with rotation operators ( see appendix a ) .    plugging ( [ rota ] ) and ( [ prov ] ) into ( [ matel2 ] ) , and neglecting @xmath35 vacuum expectation value , one obtains : @xmath63^{-1 } { \\sf r}_{\\hat { \\boldsymbol{\\omega}}}(\\phi)[p])+    d^s([p]^{\\dagger } { \\sf r}_{\\hat { \\boldsymbol{\\omega}}}(\\phi ) [ p]^{\\dagger-1 } )     \\right)_{\\tau \\sigma}\\ ] ] in order to get to this expression , advantage needs to be taken of the unitarity of the wigner rotation , i.e. : @xmath64^{-1 } { \\sf r}_{\\hat { \\boldsymbol{\\omega}}}(\\phi )   [ p ' ] ) =   d^s([{\\sf r}_{\\hat { \\boldsymbol{\\omega}}}(\\phi)(p')]^\\dagger    { \\sf r}_{\\hat { \\boldsymbol{\\omega}}}(\\phi ) [ p']^{\\dagger -1})\\ ] ] and the unitarity of @xmath15 itself as an sl(2,c ) matrix .",

    "( [ matel4 ] ) is hermitian and so , the expectation value on the left hand side ought to be real .",

    "showing that the integral on the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ matel4 ] ) is real requires a more elaborate calculation which is carried out in appendix b.    secondly , it should be pointed out that the matrix element in ( [ matel1 ] ) has a spacial integral form which allows us to readily write a phase - space distribution : @xmath69^{-1 } { \\sf r}_{\\hat { \\boldsymbol{\\omega}}}(i \\omega / t)[p])+    d^s([p]^{\\dagger } { \\sf r}_{\\hat { \\boldsymbol{\\omega}}}(i \\omega / t ) [ p]^{\\dagger-1 } )     \\right)_{\\tau \\sigma}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 $ ] is the fugacity .",
    "unlike its integral over the system s region , the function in ( [ phsp ] ) has , strictly speaking , no straightforward physical meaning and it does not need to be real or positive .",
    "eventually , one could could calculate from it some more meaningful function like the wigner s function .",
    "however , for very large systems , one expects the function ( [ phsp ] ) to become the actual phase - space single - particle distribution . for a cylindrically symmetric system to be macroscopic ,",
    "the product @xmath71 , being @xmath72 its maximal transverse radius , is supposed to be large , namely : @xmath73 hence , since a relativistic bound @xmath74 is implied in eq .",

    "for instance , it can be done by using purely geometrical considerations , like e.g. fermi - walker transport or considering the instantaneous lorentz boost without rotation connecting the tetrad to the inertial frame axes ; or , rather , it can be specified by directions relevant to actual physical quantities like e.g. the spin density tensor discussed in the next section . in general , we would like to have the most natural definition of the tetrad , possibly determined only by the four - velocity @xmath89 without invoking additional physical fields .",
    "such a natural tetrad exists and it is provided by the frenet - serret unit vectors associated to the world - lines of hydrodynamic cells @xcite , i.e. the four - velocity field tangent lines .",
    "even if this definition depends solely on the field @xmath89 , it is not unique because , at it is well - known , the four - velocity can be associated with the motion of charge ( eckart frame ) or energy ( landau frame ) .",
    "notwithstanding , in the present case of full thermodynamical equilibrium , all velocities must be the same @xcite and for a macroscopic fluid with finite angular momentum are given by ( [ rigid ] ) .",
    "we will later show , in sect .",
    "[ spin ] , that this tetrad is precisely the one which makes the spin density tensor , at least for an ideal boltzmann gas , proportional to the acceleration tensor .",
    "other choices would result in an acceleration tensor not proportional to the spin density tensor .",
    "= 2.5 in    for a uniformly rotating fluid , the frenet - serret vectors can be easily determined and are those corresponding to the axes of a rigidly rotating frame , that is , in the inertial frame components ( see fig .  [ system ] ) : @xmath165 whence we can calculate the derivatives along the world - lines . for @xmath166 : @xmath167 because @xmath85 and @xmath168 are constant along the field lines .",
    "therefore , the frenet - serret tetrad is such that the time derivative , in the fixed inertial frame , of the space vectors yields the simple law ( [ classic ] ) involving the assigned @xmath23 vector . taking the derivative of @xmath139 , one gets the acceleration four - vector @xmath12 : @xmath169 where , by definition , @xmath170 and we have used the explicit form of the velocity field ( [ rigid ] ) implying @xmath171 .",

    "however , such procedure does not leave the thermodynamic relation ( [ localfin ] ) invariant even when @xmath182 , because both energy density and pressure are affected by the belinfante transformation ( see appendix d for a detailed calculation ) and the transformed entropy would have a different local and global value , which is unacceptable .",
    "the profound reason of the lack of the freedom of changing spin tensor and stress - energy tensor in presence of thermodynamics , is the fact that entropy is an effective counting of degrees of freedom , a concept tightly related to the discrete and quantum nature of matter and definitely outside a purely classical field mechanical framework .    at full thermodynamical equilibrium",
    "we must have a symmetric stress - energy tensor in the form ( [ ideal ] ) and therefore the spin tensor must be conserved as well : @xmath183 furthermore , to meet the requirement that all currents must be parallel at full thermodynamical equilibrium , the spin tensor must be factorizable into an antisymmetric _ spin density tensor _ @xmath47 and the four - velocity : @xmath184 to determine the spin density tensor for a rotating ideal boltzmann gas , it is necessary to calculate total angular momentum density and subtract the orbital part .",

    "this makes it easy to calculate the spin density tensor , what can be done by simply summing up single particle contributions .",

    "now , to get it expressed in the inertial frame , it suffices to apply a pure lorentz boost ( without rotations ) to the components seen by the comoving observer , with an instantaneuous velocity * v * with respect to the inertial observer .",
    "therefore : @xmath327 where we also used @xmath328 .",
    "the last step is to provide a definition of angular velocity vector @xmath23 in the inertial frame .",
    "we could , for instance , define it as the spacial part of the @xmath50 four - vector in ( [ omegavect ] ) , but it would not coincide with the angular velocity vector @xmath23 that has been defined for a uniformly spinning system related to the velocity with eq .",

    "one one hand , the ( [ omegavect2 ] ) , along with the ( [ timelike ] ) , allows us to write the tensor @xmath136 in general as a function of the acceleration @xmath331 and the angular velocity @xmath23 seen by the inertial frame , by using the ( [ omega2 ] ) .",
    "this leads to , in the inertial frame : @xmath332 finally , comparing ( [ omegavect2 ] ) with ( [ omegavect ] ) we obtain the transformation rule of the angular velocity vector between the inertial and comoving frame : @xmath333",
    "the conservation of energy - momentum and angular momentum for a continuous system can be written as system of two partial differential equations : @xmath334 @xmath27 being the stress - energy tensor and @xmath335 the spin tensor .",
    "this set of two equations is invariant in form under a transformation @xcite : @xmath336 where @xmath337 is an arbitrary tensor of rank three which is antisymmetric in the last two indices .",
    "choosing @xmath338 , the new spin tensor @xmath339 vanishes and the new stress - energy tensor @xmath340 becomes symmetric ; this is the well - known belinfante symmetrization procedure .",
    "however , this transformation does not leave , for a system in full thermodynamical equilibrium , the basic relation ( [ localfin ] ) invariant , whether the @xmath341 term is included or not , and , moreover , it also changes the total entropy . to show this , we first remind the definitions of proper energy density and pressure for a given stress - energy tensor : @xmath342 for a system at full thermodynamical equilibrium , such as a rigidly rotating fluid , the stress - energy tensor _ must _ have @xcite the form : @xmath343 as well as a spin tensor which must factorize into a spin density second - order tensor and the four - velocity : @xmath344 the stress - energy tensor in ( [ stressene ] ) is already symmetric , yet the spin tensor is not vanishing .",
    "we could then think of applying the belinfante symmetrization procedure described above in order to make the new spin tensor @xmath339 vanishing , thereby obtaining a new symmetric stress - energy tensor @xmath345 .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ belinf ] ) and ( [ spinten ] ) , this new tensor reads : @xmath346 at thermodynamical equilibrium the last two terms vanish : the second one , because the velocity field is rigid , and the first one because of the ( [ omegadot ] ) and the vanishing of convective derivatives of @xmath241 , @xmath242 : @xmath347 thus , the ( [ belinf2 ] ) becomes : @xmath348 for the stress - energy tensor according ( [ belinf3 ] ) , the new energy density and pressure read , applying the ( [ rhop ] ) : @xmath349 the thermodynamical relation ( [ localfin ] ) in the new variables should read , as @xmath350 and assuming the invariance of @xmath132 : @xmath351 hence , in order to keep the thermodynamic relation invariant , the entropy should be modified by a term depending on the spin density tensor : @xmath352 the last expression can also be rewritten as , by using the definition ( [ tdef ] ) and taking advantage of the antisymmetry of @xmath47 : @xmath353 it can be shown that , for a rotating gas , all terms added to entropy density on the right - hand - side of the above equation are strictly positive . using eqs .",
    "( [ tvect ] ) , ( [ iotadef ] ) as well as ( [ contrac ] ) and ( [ omegatens ] ) , the eq .  ( [ deltaent ] ) can be rewritten as : @xmath354 the vector field @xmath355 is proportional to the centripetal acceleration and therefore has a negative divergence ; the curl of the vector field @xmath356 for the velocity ( [ rigid ] ) yields @xmath357 .",
    "hence , all three terms on the right - hand are positive and total entropy should be changed by a finite positive amount .",
    "the latter condition is clearly physically unacceptable .",
    "since the rigidly rotating gas is a system in full thermodynamical equilibrium , the new entropy density obtained after the belinfante transformation should at least have a vanishing integral over the system s region , which is not the case .",
    "therefore , we conclude that making the spin tensor vanishing is impossible and it must have a physical reality .",
    "the four - vector @xmath8 , for a single massive particle , is defined as the expectation value of the operator @xmath358 divided by the mass . if the particle is in a pure state @xmath359 then the expectation value : @xmath360 transforms as a vector because so does the relevant operator . in other words , by using the very definition of single particle states from the theory of poincar group representations @xcite : @xmath361}^{-1 }      \\widehat j^{\\mu \\nu } \\widehat p_\\nu \\widehat{[p ] } { |p^0,\\sigma\\rangle }     = \\frac{1}{m } { \\langle p^0,\\sigma| } [ p]^{\\mu}_{\\lambda }     \\widehat j^{\\lambda \\nu } \\widehat p_\\nu { |p^0,\\sigma\\rangle }     = [ p]^{\\mu}_{\\lambda } \\frac{1}{m } { \\langle p^0,\\sigma| }      \\widehat j^{\\lambda \\nu } \\widehat p_\\nu { |p^0,\\sigma\\rangle}\\ ] ] where @xmath362 . therefore , to prove that @xmath363 we just need to show it for a particle at rest . in this case : @xmath364 the boost generators @xmath365 however anticommute with the parity operator and since the states of a single particle at rest have a definite parity ( which is , by definition , the intrinsic parity of particles ) the right hand side of the above equation ought to vanish .",
    "thence , in view of ( [ t1 ] ) : @xmath366 the validity of eq .",
