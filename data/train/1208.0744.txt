    "ask if the degenerate distance - number of outerplanar graphs are uniformly bounded .",
    "we answer this positively by showing that the degenerate distance number of outerplanar graphs is at most @xmath4 .",
    "this result is derived by explicitly constructing a degenerate drawing for every such graph .",
    "[ thm : 3 degenerate ] for almost every triple @xmath5 , every outerplanar graph has a degenerate drawing using only edge - lengths @xmath6 and @xmath7 .    for matters of convenience , throughout the paper",
    "we consider all linear embeddings as mapping vertices to the complex plane .",
    "while the distance - number and the degenerate distance - number of a graph are two natural notions in the context of representing a graph as a diagram in the plane , this was not the sole motivation to their introduction .",
    "both notions were introduced by carmi , dujmovic , morin and wood in @xcite , and generalize several well studied problems . indeed , erds suggested in @xcite the problem of determining or estimating the minimum possible number of distinct distances between @xmath8 points in the plane .",
    "this problem can be rephrased as finding the degenerate distance - number of @xmath9 , the complete graph on @xmath8 vertices . recently , guth and katz , in a ground - breaking paper @xcite , established a lower - bound of @xmath10 on this number , which almost matches the @xmath11 upper - bound due to erds .",
    "another problem , considered by szemerdi ( see theorem 13.7 in @xcite ) , is that of finding the minimum possible number of distances between @xmath8 non - collinear points in the plane .",
    "this problem can be rephrased as finding the distance - number of @xmath9 .",
    "one interesting consequence of the known results on these questions is that the distance - number and the degenerate distance - number of @xmath9 are not the same , thus justifying the two separate notions . for a short survey of the history of both problems , including some classical bounds ,",
    "the reader is referred to the background section of @xcite .    another notion",
    "which is generalized by the degenerate distance - number is that of a unit - distance graph , that is , a graph that can be embedded in the plane so that two vertices are at distance one if and only if they are connected by an edge .",
    "observe that all unit - distance graphs have degenerate distance - number @xmath12 while the converse is not true .",
    "constructing `` dense '' unit - distance graphs is a classical problem .",
    "the best construction , due to erds @xcite , gives an @xmath8-vertex unit - distance graph with @xmath13 edges , while the best known upper - bound , due to spencer , szemerdi and trotter @xcite , is @xmath14 ( a simpler proof for this bound was found by szkely , see @xcite ) .",
    "note that this implies that the @xmath15 most frequent interpoint distances between @xmath8 points occur in total no more than @xmath16 times , and thus that a graph with degenerate distance - number @xmath15 may have no more than @xmath16 edges .",
    "katz and tardos gave in @xcite another bound on the frequency of interpoint distances between @xmath8 points in the plane , which yields that a graph with distance - number @xmath15 may have no more than @xmath17 edges .",
    "after introducing the notions of distance - number and degenerate distance - number , carmi , dujmovic , morin and wood studied in @xcite the behavior of bounded degree graphs with respect to these notions .",
    "they show that graphs with bounded degree greater or equal to five can have degenerate distance - number arbitrarily large , giving a polynomial lower - bound for graphs with bounded degree greater or equal to seven .",
    "they also give a @xmath18 upper - bound to the distance - number of bounded degree graphs with bounded treewidth . in the same paper ,",
    "the authors ask whether this bound can be improved for outerplanar graphs , and in particular whether such graphs have a uniformly bounded degenerate distance - number , a question which we answer here positively .",
