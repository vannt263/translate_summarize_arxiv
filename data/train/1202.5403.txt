    "these high-@xmath18 etgs are characterized by old stars ( 1 - 3 gyr ) , @xmath19-folding decaying star formation timescales @xmath200.10.3 gyr , low specific star formation rates ( ssfr@xmath21 gyr@xmath22 ) , low dust extinction , large stellar masses ( @xmath23 ) , spheroidal morphologies ( although some of these systems have a disk - like component ; van der wel et al .",

    "a puzzling property of etgs at @xmath16 is that they have smaller sizes , down to effective radii @xmath26 kpc , and correspondingly higher internal mass densities than present - day etgs with the same mass ( e.g. daddi et al . 2005 ; trujillo et al .",

    "it is not clear yet whether the environment plays ( e.g. papovich et al .",
    "2011 ; cooper et al . 2011 ) or not ( e.g. rettura et al . 2010 ) a role in the etg size evolution . the few available measurements of stellar velocity dispersions are consistent with those expected from the etg sizes and confirm that these systems are truly massive ( cenarro et al . 2009 ; cappellari et al . 2009 ; onodera et al . 2010 ; van dokkum , kriek & franx 2009 ; van de sande et al .",
    "several models have been proposed to explain the size  mass evolution , including dissipationless ( _ dry _ ) major and minor merging , adiabatic expansion driven by stellar mass loss and/or strong feedback , and smooth stellar accretion ( e.g. khochfar & silk 2006 ; bournaud , jog & combes 2007 ; fan et al .",

    "however , the global picture is far from being clear . in this paper",
    ", we exploit a large sample of etgs in order to investigate the evolution of their size as a function of redshift and mass , and compare it with the predictions of cosmological models of structure formation .",
    "in order to improve statistically on previous studies , we selected a large sample of 1975 etgs at @xmath27 by collecting data from the literature and public data , requiring the availability of spectroscopic redshifts ( or high - quality photometric redshifts for @xmath28 ) , stellar masses , sizes ( @xmath2 ) and , when possible , age of the stellar population ( see tab .",
    "1 ) . the etgs in the different subsamples share the global property to have been originally selected based on the combination of colors , spectra ( or sometimes also ssfr ) typical of old / passive galaxies with the confirmation of spheroidal ( e / s0 ) morphology , or vice versa .",
    "we recall that selection criteria for etgs are strongly correlated , with up to @xmath2985% color / spectra - selected etgs being also morphologically e / s0 ( e.g. renzini 2006 and references therein ) .",
    "the etg sizes were generally measured in the observed - frame red - optical for low-/intermediate - redshift samples and/or in the near - infrared for higher redshifts , i.e. typically sampling the rest - frame optical region at all redshifts .",
    "recently , damjanov et al . ( 2011 ) and cassata et al . (",
    "2011 ) have shown that the sizes measured in the rest - frame uv and in the optical correlate very strongly with each other , thus excluding substantial biases dependent on the wavelength at which the size was measured .",
    "the sdss sample of hyde & bernardi ( 2009 ) was included as the reference sample at @xmath30 .",
    ".etg subsamples [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     the different subsamples were harmonized to the same cosmology ( @xmath31 km s@xmath22 mpc@xmath22 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) , and the stellar masses and ages rescaled to the maraston ( 2005 ) stellar population synthesis models with the chabrier initial mass function ( imf ) by using empirical scaling relations of pforr et al .",
    "( 2012 ) .",
    "based on the information available in the literature , the stellar mass completeness of most subsamples is @xmath34 at all redshifts .",

    "the final sample was reduced to 1080 galaxies in order to avoid mass incompleteness effects ( see section 4 for details ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the size  mass relation in three redshift ranges with a comparable number of galaxy in each bin .",

    "this result is consistent with recent works ( damjanov et al .",
    "2011 ; newman et al .",
    "2011 ) , and does not depend significantly on the choice of the redshift bin limits or the minimum stellar mass cuts . in comparison , the sdss etgs with @xmath39 10.5 have @xmath430.58@xmath44 , consistent with shen et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "black and blue symbols indicate sdss and non - sdss etgs respectively .",
    "only sdss etgs older than 10 gyr are shown in order to avoid excessive crowding .",

    "( 2003 ) and its @xmath45 scatter ( dashed black lines ) .",
    "red dashed lines : best fit relations using @xmath38 . ]",
    "2 shows the redshift evolution of the etg size in two complementary ways : the mass - normalized radius ( @xmath46 , where @xmath47 m@xmath14 , adopting @xmath48 as representative value ) , and radius normalized to the average size of sdss etgs ( @xmath49 ) in three mass bins .",
    "both quantities are useful to derive the size evolution independently of the correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the evolution is parametrized by the usual functional form @xmath50 .",
    "clearly , this parametrization does not mean that _ all _ high-@xmath18 etgs are the direct progenitors of _ all _ low-@xmath18 etgs because these galaxies evolve in the redshift range @xmath0 through several processes and increase their number density and mass , but it has simply the statistical meaning of indicating how the _ typical _ sizes compare at different redshifts .    in order to mitigate the potential effects of stellar mass incompleteness , for each mass bin of fig.2 ( top three panels ) , the galaxies with @xmath51 were removed from each subsample .",
    "thus , each mass bin is always complete down to the minimum mass of the bin .",
    "for instance , the etgs with @xmath52 m@xmath14 at @xmath53 and @xmath54 m@xmath14 at @xmath55 have been excluded from the zcosmos and the cassata et al .",

    "this result is stable against changing @xmath41 between 0.4 and 0.7 , the boundaries of the redshift bins , and the minimum stellar mass .",

    "green and blue small symbols indicate individual sdss and non - sdss etgs respectively , whereas the large black and red filled circles are the average values ( @xmath63 ) of sdss and non - sdss respectively , each with the @xmath64 scatter .",
    "the black solid line is the best fitting function to the red and black points .",
    "the redshift bins adopted for the non - sdss etgs in this figure are @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 .",
    "the cyan dashed lines show the best fits for the case of etgs with @xmath70 ( redshift bins : @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 ) . ]",
    "2 ( top three panels ) shows @xmath2 normalized to @xmath74 .",
    "for the three bins of increasing mass , we derive @xmath56=-1.23@xmath75 0.15 , -0.87@xmath750.14 and -1.39@xmath750.13 .",
    "this suggests that @xmath56 does not significantly depend on stellar mass , although a steepening is suggested in the most massive bin .",
    "these results are stable , within the statistical uncertainties , against changes in the minimum stellar mass in the lowest mass bin , in the boundaries of the mass bins , and in the minimum age of the sdss etgs .    fig .",
    "2 also shows that the etg size growth rate seems to increase significantly at high redshift , suggesting a slower evolution at @xmath70 . for the mass - normalized radius ( bottom panel )",
    ", @xmath56 becomes -0.57@xmath750.15 if the etgs at @xmath76 are excluded .",
    "similarly for @xmath77 , @xmath56 becomes @xmath56=-0.73@xmath750.14 , -0.76@xmath750.13 and -0.75@xmath75 0.14 if etgs at @xmath10 are excluded in the three bins of increasing mass .",
    "we note that the flattening is particularly pronounced and significant in the bin of largest masses .",
    "the flattening of @xmath56 is also present , within the statistical uncertainties , against changing the limits of the redshift bins if we cut etgs around @xmath78 .",
    "for instance , if the etgs with @xmath79 are excluded in the bin with @xmath3910.9 , we derive @xmath56=-0.95(-0.72)@xmath750.15 .",
    "the overall results presented in this section do not change if median values are used instead of the average ones , nor if the sdss data points are excluded .",
    "the potential role of the so - called progenitor bias ( e.g. saglia et al . 2010 and references therein ) has been assessed through an _ age filtering _ by comparing the size of etgs having ages compatible with the cosmic time passed from high-@xmath18 to low-@xmath18 . for a given redshift range @xmath80 and average redshift @xmath81 , we estimated @xmath56 by comparing the average size of the etgs ( having an average age @xmath82 ) with the size of sdss etgs with ages at @xmath83 between @xmath84 + \\tau(z - z_0)$ ] and @xmath85+\\tau(z - z_0)$ ] , where @xmath86 is the cosmic time passed from @xmath18 to @xmath83 .",
    "based on this approach , no significant or systematic changes of @xmath56 have been found for a variety of tested redshift ranges .",
    "for example , for etgs with @xmath8710.9 at @xmath88 , we derive @xmath89 and @xmath90 respectively with and without applying the above age filtering. similarly , if we select the most distant etgs ( @xmath91 ) , we obtain @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "if we take these results at face value , this implies that most of the @xmath94 evolution is unlikely to be the result of a progenitor bias due to high-@xmath18 etgs being preferentially selected to be redder and more compact than lower-@xmath18 younger and larger etgs missed at high-@xmath18 .",
    "however , we recall that , due to the heterogeneous estimates of the stellar ages in our sample , this result should be confirmed with larger and more homogeneous samples . on the other hand , we note that large etgs are indeed absent at @xmath95 in the gmass subsample ( fig .",
    "2 ) , that is selected based solely on morphology irrespective of colours ( cassata et al .",
    "dissipationless ( _ dry _ ) merging is one of the few mechanisms known to make galaxies less compact ( e.g. , nipoti et al . 2003 ; naab et al .",
    "2009 ) , so it is often invoked to explain the observed size evolution of etgs . here",
    "we briefly address the question of whether the observed size evolution is consistent with the merger histories of concordance @xmath1 cold dark matter ( @xmath1cdm ) cosmology . for this purpose",
    ", we use the @xmath1cdm - based merger models presented in nipoti et al .",
    "( 2012 , hereafter n12 ) , which are such that the variation in surface - mass density is maximized , because dissipative effects are neglected . in particular , we adopt here model b of n12 , which is the most strongly evolving of their models , so the predicted size evolution must be considered an upper limit . here",
    "we briefly describe the main properties of the model , but we refer the reader to n12 for details . for an observed etg with measured stellar mass @xmath3 and effective radius @xmath2 , the model allows to calculate the redshift evolution of @xmath3 and @xmath2 via analytic functions calibrated on @xmath96-body simulations . the galaxy is first assigned a halo mass using the redshift - dependent stellar to halo mass relation of behroozi , conroy , & wechsler ( 2010 ) . the halo growth - history",
    "is then computed using fakhouri et al .",
    "( 2010 ) fit to halo merger histories in the millenium i and ii simulations ( springel et al . 2005 ; boylan - kolchin et al .",
    "the associated growth of @xmath3 is obtained by assigning stellar mass to satellite halos with behroozi et al .",
    "( 2010 ) recipe , and considering only mergers with mass ratio @xmath970.03 ( to exclude cases with too long merging time ) . finally , the corresponding variation in @xmath2 is computed using analytic functions verified with @xmath96-body simulations of minor and major dry mergers between spheroids . for observed high-@xmath18 etgs ,",
    "we compute the predicted @xmath98 and @xmath94 up to @xmath99 , which is the average redshift of massive ( @xmath100 ) sdss etgs .",
    "the evolution in the @xmath3-@xmath2 plane is shown in fig .",
    "3 , taking as progenitors the observed etgs with @xmath69 ( @xmath101 ) and those with @xmath68 ( @xmath102 ) . in both cases",
    "the present - day descendants tend to be more compact than real @xmath30 etgs , but the deviation from the sdss @xmath3-@xmath2 relation is larger than the observed scatter ( @xmath103 @xmath104 at given @xmath3 ) only when @xmath105 progenitors are considered : the @xmath106 descendants have median vertical offset from the sdss best - fit @xmath107(-0.1 ) for @xmath105(1.7 ) progenitors . in the case of @xmath108 progenitors , also the @xmath109 model descendants are more compact than real @xmath110 etgs .",
    "we conclude that the @xmath10 etgs are so compact that , even according to extreme pure _ dry_-merger models , their low-@xmath18 descendants are predicted to be significantly more compact than present - day etgs . on the other hand , the milder size evolution observed since @xmath111 is marginally consistent with @xmath1cdm _ dry_-merger models , though the model descendants are distributed in the @xmath3-@xmath2 plane with larger scatter than the observed etgs ( see also n12 ) .",
    "an additional problem is the presence , among the predicted @xmath30 descendants , of outliers , i.e. galaxies in regions of the @xmath112-@xmath2 in which there are no sdss etgs : for instance , three model galaxies with @xmath113 and @xmath114 kpc , and a model galaxy with @xmath115 and @xmath116 kpc ( fig .",
    "we recall here that the existence of compact low-@xmath18 etgs with sizes and masses comparable to those of compact etgs at @xmath10 is somehow unclear , with some results showing an absence of such galaxies ( e.g. taylor et al .",
    "2010 ) and others finding a few candidates ( e.g. shih & stockton 2011 ; valentinuzzi et al . 2010 ) .",
    "do our results necessarily imply that dry merging alone can not explain the observed size evolution ?",
    "in principle it could be the case that dry mergers are responsible for the whole size evolution , but the actual rate of mergers is higher than predicted .",
    "this hypothesis can be tested by further comparison with observations .",
    "a first constraint comes from the observed redshift evolution of the etg stellar mass function .",
    "let us take , for instance , the model describing the evolution of the @xmath117 etgs .",
    "at each @xmath118 we select only model galaxies with @xmath119 and for this subsample we measure the average stellar mass @xmath120 .",
    "the redshift variation of @xmath121 is found to be well represented by the fit @xmath122 , i.e. the average mass increase by @xmath123 from @xmath124 to the present .",
    "this is compatible with observed evolution of the etg stellar mass function at @xmath12 ( e.g. pozzetti et al .",
    "another testable feature of the model is the predicted merger rate .",
    "let us define major(minor ) mergers those with mass ratio@xmath97(@xmath125)1/4 .",
    "the predicted number of major mergers per unit time @xmath126 decreases for decreasing @xmath18 ( see fakhouri et al .",
    "2010 ) : for our model etgs we get , on average , @xmath127 at @xmath128 . these rates are higher by a factor of @xmath129 than estimated observationally at similar @xmath18 by bundy et al .",
    "( 2009 ; see also lotz et al .",
    "2011 ) , indicating that the considered model might be extreme also in this respect . in the model , both major and minor mergers contribute significantly to the growth of stellar mass ( for instance , @xmath130 each between @xmath131 and @xmath132 ) , so , at least within @xmath1cdm , massive etgs do not accrete most of their mass in very minor mergers , which would be more effective in increasing the galaxy size .",
    "the above arguments suggest that other processes not included in the model should contribute significantly to the size evolution .",
    "unfortunately , at the moment the proposals for additional mechanisms are not very promising : fan et al .",
    "( 2008 ) envisaged that feedback from qsos could play a role , but also this scenario is not without problems ( ragone - figueroa & granato 2011 ) .    cdm model described in section 5 .",
    "the progenitors ( circles ) are the etgs observed at @xmath69 ( @xmath101 , upper panel ) and those observed at @xmath68 ( @xmath102 , lower panel ) .",
    "the predicted descendants at @xmath109 and @xmath99 are represented , respectively , by the triangles and the squares .",
    "for comparison we plot sdss etgs ( green dots ) and the local sdss best - fit with its observed scatter ( black solid and dashed curves ; shen et al .",
    "the red dashed lines indicate the best - fits for etgs observed at @xmath133 . ]",
    "the analysis of a large sample of etgs at @xmath0 shows that their size evolves independently of stellar mass and possibily faster at @xmath10 ( especially for etgs with the largest masses ) .",
    "the interpretation of this result is not straightforward as the available information does not allow us to assess if this is an observational bias ( e.g. large etgs with low surface brightness are missed in high-@xmath18 samples ) , or it is an intrinsic change in the evolutionary pattern implying a very rapid growth of etgs from @xmath10 to lower redshifts .",
    "we explored the possibility of pure _ dry _ merging as the dominant growth mechanism within the @xmath1cdm framework , and found that this scenario is marginally consistent with the average size evolution at @xmath11 , but predicts descendants too compact for @xmath10 progenitor etgs .",
    "further studies and larger samples of etgs at @xmath134 , which will be obtained with future wide - field surveys ( e.g. _ euclid _ , laureijs et al .",
    "2011 ) , will shed light on these open questions .",

    "<S> we present the analysis of a large sample of early - type galaxies ( etgs ) at @xmath0 aimed at tracing the cosmic evolution of their size and compare it with a model of pure dissipationless ( _ dry _ ) merging in the @xmath1cdm framework . the effective radius @xmath2 depends on stellar mass @xmath3 as @xmath4 with @xmath5 at all redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> the redshift evolution of the mass- or sdss - normalized size can be reproduced as @xmath6 with @xmath7 , with the most massive etgs possibly showing the fastest evolutionary rate ( @xmath8 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this size evolution slows down significantly to @xmath9 if the etgs at @xmath10 are removed from the sample , suggesting an accelerated increase of the typical sizes at @xmath10 , especially for the etgs with the largest masses . </S>",
    "<S> a pure _ dry _ merging @xmath1cdm model is marginally consistent with the average size evolution at @xmath11 , but predicts descendants too compact for @xmath10 progenitor etgs . </S>",
    "<S> this opens the crucial question on what physical mechanism can explain the accelerated evolution at @xmath10 , or whether an unclear observational bias is partly responsible for that .    [ firstpage ]    </S>",
