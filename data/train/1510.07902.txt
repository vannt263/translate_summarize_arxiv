    "one goal of heavy ion collisions is to identify and study the properties of the deconfined matter , called quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "heavy - flavor bound states turn out to be valuable probes of this strong coupling medium produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "@xmath1 consists of @xmath2 and @xmath3 with large binding energy .",
    "its suppression was suggested as a signature of the deconfined medium due to color debye screening  @xcite .",
    "@xmath1 nuclear modification factor @xmath4  @xcite , the elliptic flows  @xcite , and the average transverse momentum square  @xcite tend to support the existence of qgp at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "however , at low colliding energies at the super proton synchrotron ( sps ) and the facility for antiproton and ion research ( fair ) , situation becomes more complicated , because effects of hadron gas are very important on charmonium production , compared with effects of qgp . in order to identify this",
    ", we need to include all the contributions such as the effects of cold nuclear matter from colliding nuclei , quark gluon plasma and hadron gas , at these low colliding energies  @xcite",
    ". the production of @xmath1 from the recombination of charm quark pairs in the fireball should also be considered  @xcite .",
    "the nuclear modification factor is defined as @xmath5 the numerator is charmonium yield in nucleus - nucleus collisions with medium modification .",
    "there are three contributions to it : initial production from the primordial nucleon collisions , @xmath2 and @xmath3 recombination in qgp , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 recombination in hadron gas .",
    "it helps to understand the mechanisms of charmonium suppression and production in the medium through detailed calculations about each of three parts .",
    "the denominator is charmonium production in proton - proton collisions , scaled by the number of binary collisions .",
    "this is to establish the initial number of charmonium without nuclear matter effects",
    "in order to understand the charmonium evolution in heavy ion collisions , both hot medium and charmonium evolution should be treated dynamically . at sps @xmath8 gev pb+pb and fair @xmath0 gev au+au collisions",
    ", we assume the boost invariant expansion of medium in longitudinal direction , and focus on the medium evolution at transverse plane  @xcite .",
    "we use ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional ideal hydro dynamics with the conservation equation of net baryon density , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is energy - momentum tensor , @xmath11 is velocity of fluid cells .",
    "@xmath12 is net baryon density . for the initialization of hydrodynamic equations at fair , the total multiplicity density at mid - rapidity",
    "is taken as @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "both the time scales of medium reaching local equilibrium at sps and fair are taken @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "for other inputs at sps , they are the same as in  @xcite , except that we abandon the approximation of entropy cut .",
    "that approximation assumes hydrodynamics does nt work for hot medium below a certain entropy density @xmath15 and all hydrodynamic variables are set as zero .",
    "this cut - off of hot medium will strongly underestimate effects of hadron gas on charmonium evolution .    in order to see the difference of hot medium and their effects on charmonium production between fair and sps",
    ", we plot the time evolution of temperature at the center point of the collisions , see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the maximum temperature of the medium at fair is about 215 mev , which is comparable with the result in  @xcite .    .",
    "]    we assume the first order phase transition between qgp and hadron gas phase .",
    "the temperature of phase transition @xmath16 depends on the baryon chemical potential @xmath17 .",
    "it increases with decreasing @xmath17 . in the mixed phase",
    ", medium continues expanding outside which will decrease the net baryon density and baryon chemical potential .",
    "this will increase @xmath18 .",
    "that s why even in the mixed phase , the temperature @xmath18 slightly increases with time instead of being constant .",
    "also , the net baryon density is larger at fair than the value at sps .",
    "this makes @xmath16 smaller at fair compared with the value at sps , just as fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] shows .",
    "the initial baryon density with rapidity is taken as @xmath19 at fair  @xcite . with the implements of hadron gas contribution in this work , we are able to discuss the relative contribution of qgp and hadron gas on charmonium production at sps and fair .",
    "for the initially produced charmonium , they may be dissolved by inelastic collisions with other nucleons .",
    "this suppression exist in pa collisions where qgp should be absent , and is called `` nucleon absorption '' , simulated by the inelastic cross - section with nucleons , @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath20 is taken as @xmath21 for @xmath1 and @xmath22  @xcite , and @xmath23 mb for @xmath24 at sps .",
    "gluons may also obtain extra energy by multi - scatterings with other nucleons before fusing into a @xmath25 .",
    "this effect ( called cronin effect ) will change the transverse momentum distribution of initially produced charmonium  @xcite , @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 is the average length gluon passes through before the reaction @xmath28 , @xmath29 is taken as @xmath30 @xmath31 by fitting the data of pa collisions .",
    "the time scale of producing heavy quark pair is @xmath32 , and can be neglected .",
    "but it takes much longer time for a charm pair to form the charmonium wave function . with uncertainty relation ,",
    "@xmath1 formation time is about @xmath33 in its local rest frame . with @xmath34 at fair and sps , we can get the lorentz factor between lab - frame and @xmath1 local rest frame .",
    "so @xmath1 formation time in lab - frame is about @xmath35 .",
    "it s smaller than @xmath36 , which supports the basic assumption that all initially produced @xmath1 are already formed before the transverse expansion of bulk medium . for excited charmonium states , situation becomes much more complicated and their decay contribution to the final yield of @xmath1 is not dominant .",
    "so we neglect the formation time effect for all charmonium states .",
    "this effect may be important at lhc where @xmath37 is larger and @xmath38 is smaller .",
    "charmonium mass is large and hard to be thermalized , we use a boltzmann - type transport equation  @xcite to describe the evolution of their phase space distribution in qgp and hadron gas , @xmath39 where @xmath40 = ( @xmath1 , @xmath22 , @xmath24 ) .",

    "when the contribution of qgp is included , it can explain the data well in central collisions .",
    "for the excited states of charmonium which contribute 40% to the final yield of total @xmath1 , most of them are dissolved in qgp by color debye screening , due to their small dissociation temperature @xmath86 .",

    "it overestimates the charmonium suppression in semi - central and peripheral collisions .",

    "when qgp is included , charmonium suppression by hot medium is stronger in the center of fireball , where cronin effect is also stronger .",
    "the dissociation of charmonium by qgp reduces the average transverse momentum square ( black dashed line ) .",
    "it explains the data well at central collisions . after the evolution of qgp , effects of hadron gas at @xmath89",

    "but at peripheral collisions , effects of hadron gas and nucleon absorption explain the data well , and there should be no qgp produced .",

    "the color band is caused by the uncertainty of qgp . ]    for the average transverse momentum square at fair , it shows similar tendency with the result of sps .",
    "the increasement of black dotted line in fig.[figpt2_fair ] is due to the cronin effect .",
    "this effect is proportional to the thickness of nucleus , and is stronger in central collisions .",
    "since the matter produced in central collisions is denser and hotter than that in peripheral collisions , the @xmath1 has more chance to be dissolved by qgp , especially for excited states of charmonium .",
    "this suppresses the @xmath83 after including the hot medium .",
    "that s why @xmath93 with qgp ( red solid line ) become smaller compared with the situation with only nuclear absorption ( black dotted line ) . with only hadron phase",
    ", the inelastic cross section between @xmath1 and ( @xmath69 ) is taken as a constance when @xmath94 is larger than a threshold .",
    "this results in a relatively small @xmath83 ( blue solid line ) compared with the situation of qgp .",
    "the real situation of @xmath4 and @xmath83 should be inside the color bands in fig.[figraa_fair ] and fig.[figpt2_fair ] .",
    "it should be close to the line with qgp ( red solid line ) at central collisions , and close to the line with only hadron phase ( blue solid line ) at peripheral collisions .",
    "in summary , based on a realistic description of open and hidden heavy flavor evolution in hot medium , we calculate charmonium suppression and production with and without the existence of qgp at sps and fair . with only nuclear absorption and hadron phase , both charmoinum nuclear modification factor @xmath4 and average transverse momentum square @xmath83 explain the data well at peripheral collisions , but it underestimate the charmonium suppression in central collisions . with contributions of qgp , color debye screening on excited charmonium states strongly suppress the final yield of @xmath1 , and can explain both @xmath4 and @xmath83 well . from two limits given in fig.[figraa_sps ] and",
    "fig.[figpt2_sps ] , one can come to a conclusion that qgp should be produced at the most central collisions and not produced at peripheral collisions at sps .",
    "charm and anti - charm quarks is hard to be thermalized at these colliding energies , and have small probability to recombine together during their evolution in the hot medium .",
    "the regeneration of charmonium is strongly suppressed . based on above conclusions , predictions of charmonium observables",
    "are given at fair @xmath0 gev au+au collisions .",
