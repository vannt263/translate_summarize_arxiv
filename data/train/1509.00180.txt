    "they tend to be dwarf galaxies but , unlike other dwarfs @xcite , their chemical composition may not be uniform , with the low metallicity only in regions of intense star formation .",
    "such non - uniformity is particularly revealing because the timescale for azimuthal mixing in normal galaxies is short , of the order of a fraction of the rotational period ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it would imply that the metal - poor gas in xmps was recently accreted from a nearly pristine cloud , providing long - sought evidence for cosmic accretion that has been difficult to observe directly .",
    "for example , gas flows have been observed on the periphery of distant galaxies using absorption lines in the spectra of background sources .",
    "however , the material is often not significantly lower in metals than the galaxy itself , suggesting gas recycled from previous outflows , and therefore dynamically detached from the large - scale cosmic web @xcite . here",
    "we put on firm observational bases the existence of chemical inhomogeneities in most xmps , thus unequivocally showing their star formation to be feeding from external metal - poor gas . measuring chemical inhomogeneities in xmps is technically challenging , requiring spectra of high quality from faint regions .",

    "the ten galaxies in table  [ table ] represent 7% of all known xmps when the project began @xcite , and they were chosen to be representative of the xmp family .",
    "they were observed with the long - slit mode of the spectrograph osiris at gtc .",
    "we used an intermediate resolution grism which renders the spectral range needed for abundance analysis in a single exposure ( from 3700  to 7000 ) with a dispersion of 7.8  per pixel , enough to spectrally resolve the required emission lines .",

    "the spectrum contains a number of collisionally excited emission lines that empirically provide electron - density and electron - temperature .",
    "given temperature and density , atomic properties yield the expected emission per ion , therefore , the total flux of a particular emission line directly gives the total number of ions in the nebula responsible for such emission .",
    "the case of oxygen is particularly favorable since , in hii regions , oxygen is in the form of o@xmath51 and o@xmath52 , and both species produce strong emission lines . the total oxygen abundance results from adding the contribution of o@xmath51 and o@xmath52 .",
    "a drawback of this technique ( the so - called direct method ; dm ) is the need to measure fluxes of weak lines often at the noise level .",

    "we circumvent the difficulty using hii - chi - mistry @xcite , a procedure that compares the brightest optical emission lines with predictions of a grid of photoionization models covering a wide range of possible physical conditions .",

    "this method leads to an oxygen abundance which is consistent with the dm determination within 0.07  dex , i.e. , within the intrinsic uncertainty of the dm @xcite .",
    "the agreement implies that hii - chi - mistry inherits the good properties of dm , so that the geometry and other assumptions needed to build the grid of models do not influence the inferred oxygen abundance .",

    "if the evolution proceeds as a closed - box , and it begins from pure metal - free gas , the fraction of mass in metals of the interstellar medium @xmath62 depends only on the gas that remains ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so that if a region of metallicity @xmath63 and gas mass @xmath64 evolves to reach a metallicity @xmath65 of gas mass @xmath66 , then @xmath67 with @xmath68 the stellar yield , i.e. , the mass of new metals eventually ejected per unit mass locked into stars . the red solid line in fig .",
    "[ infoa ] shows the evolution expected for a region at the red bullet assuming a typical oxygen yield .",
    "it renders metallicities too high to explain the metallicity of the host galaxy by close - box evolution of the starbursts .",
    "if gas is allowed to leak out of the system , the relationship between gas mass and metallicity remains formally as for the closed - box model , replacing the stellar yield with an effective yield @xmath69 that involves the fraction of mass in stars that returns to the interstellar medium @xmath70 , as well as the so - called mass loading factor @xmath71 , that gives the outflow rate in terms of the sfr ; @xmath72 .",
    "the blue solid line in fig .",
    "[ infoa ] corresponds to @xmath73 , or to @xmath74 given @xmath75 , which implies that for each solar mass of gas locked into stars , four solar masses of gas flow out of the system .",
    "figure  [ infob ] shows the scatter plot of metallicity vs galaxy stellar mass for both the host and the starburst .",
    "our objects are outliers of the mass metallicity relationship ( mzr ) observed in the local universe .",
    "the green and the blue lines in fig .  [ infob ] represent mzrs for the range of low - mass galaxies @xcite and high - mass galaxies @xcite , respectively , with the shaded areas portraying the observed standard deviation at a given mass .",
    "the high - mass metallicities have been decreased by 0.2dex to make the strong - line method of the original work consistent with the dm scale used here @xcite .",
    "the mzr is based on the metallicity of the brightest parts of the galaxies therefore , xmps must be represented by the metallicity of their starbursts , which clearly lie below the observed mzr ( fig .",
    "[ infob ] ) .",
    "the scatter at a given mass is known to be related to the sfr , so that the higher the sfr the lower the metallicity . the pink area in fig .",
    "[ infob ] represents the spread in metallicity to be expected if the sfr changes by @xmath76 times the mean sfr given by the red solid line @xcite , and this dependence naturally accounts for the large difference in metallicity between starburst and host .",
    "xmps are going through an active star - formation phase , with starbursts of low metallicity .",
    "the end of this phase will disclose a galaxy having properties close to those of the host , i.e. , a stellar mass similar to the present xmp but with low sfr and high metallicity .",
    "the xmps studied here have an off - center starburst of low metallicity but , otherwise , they are rather normal disk - like galaxies with exponential light profiles , modest rotational velocities , and significant random motions @xcite . under these conditions the time - scale for azimuthal gas - mixing is rather short ( see sect .  [ motivation ] ) , therefore , the metal - poor gas associated with the starburst must have arrived to the galaxy recently .",
    "the mass surface density at the starburst is unusually large for the outer parts of dwarf irregular galaxies , by a factor of @xmath77 .",
    "if the excess mass is from a recently accreted cosmic cloud , then it mixed with the ambient gas and diluted the ambient metallicity by the same factor , 10:1 .",
    "this dilution accounts for the metallicity drop in the starbursts .",
    "the accretion time is constrained by the localization of the star formation , which is not sheared or spiral - like .",
    "the confinement of the enhanced star formation to local regions several hundred parsecs in diameter ( table  [ table ] ) implies that the accretion time is shorter than the orbital time . for small galaxies like these the orbital time over one radian",
    "is @xmath78 myr .",
    "accretion lasting for @xmath78  myr or less corresponds to an impacting cloud with a vertical extent that is similar to the radius of the galaxy or several kpc , considering that the infall speed is likely comparable to the rotation speed since both are set by the gravitational potential . from these considerations , we conclude the following scenario for xmp galaxies with locally low metallicities studied here . sometime within a period of @xmath78 myr , a cosmic cloud with",
    "low metallicity impacted the outer region of a regular dwarf galaxy disk , compressing it , diluting the original metals , and triggering excess star formation , all by factors of 10 .",
    "this picture is consistent with the current ideas on how dwarf galaxies grow through gas accretion ( sect .",
    "[ motivation ] and * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , even though the interaction between gas streams and forming disks remains to be properly understood @xcite .",
    "explanations alternative to the cosmic origin of the gas can not be completely ruled out , although they are disfavored by observations .",
    "major mergers are not obvious in the optical images , and can be further discarded arguing that xmps reside in low density environments , with their large hi envelops showing only moderate distortions @xcite .",
    "minor gas - rich mergers could explain localized metallicity drops , provided that the gas in the accreted galaxy has a metallicity lower than the metallicity at the drop . a minor - merger scenario differs from a gas accretion scenario only if the merging galaxy has enough stars and dark matter",
    ". the additional mass would generally be much larger than the merging gas mass alone , and the distortion on the host would be larger as well . merging stars should also penetrate the host disk , unlike the merging gas , and these stars would orbit differently than the host stars , possibly producing star streams in the host halo . since neither large hi distortions nor stellar streams are evident in xmps ( see , e.g. , figs .  [ example ] and [ example2 ] ) , the hypothetical merging galaxy must have little dark matter and stars and , consequently , it could be likened to a gas stream . on the other hand , model cosmic gas streams",
    "are often clumpy , with some stars forming in the densest cores ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in which case the accretion of a clumpy stream is equivalent to a merger with a small very gas - rich dark - matter - poor satellite .",
    "the difficulty to distinguish a pure gas accretion event from a gas - rich minor merger can be linked to the problem of finding an operational definition of _ galaxy _ at the low - mass end of galaxy masses ( see * ? ? ?",
    "yet another possibility for feeding xmps could be gas accretion from the galaxy halo induced by galactic fountains @xcite . the metal - rich gas ejected from the stellar disk acts as a catalyst when it becomes mixed with the hot metal - poor halo gas .",
    "the mixing catastrophically decreases the halo cooling - time , and mass from the halo is dragged along when the fountain gas falls back onto the disk .",
    "several observations disfavor this possibility , though .",
    "the mass dragged along is only a fraction of the original mass , and so , the gas falling in is not very metal - poor . in addition , the accreted material is expected to spread out over the disk rather than being concentrated , and the gaseous haloes in dwarfs are not massive , suggesting the mechanism to be inefficient in our particular case .",
    "a unidirectional propagation of star - formation may produce a head - tail morphology , with decreasing surface brightness and increasing age and metallicity from the position of the current starburst .",
    "this mechanism was proposed by to explain the color gradient in the xmp galaxy sbs 0335 - 052e , and may work for other xmps as well .",
    "the required unidirectional propagation would naturally occur if the underlying gaseous structure is already very prolate . even if uncommon , cigar - like galaxies are theoretically conceivable ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and have been observed at high redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the gas - cloud impact scenario explains the lower limit for the metallicities of the xmps , which is around 1/50th the solar metallicity .",
    "the absence of objects with lower metallicity has challenged interpretation for decades @xcite .",
    "however , the threshold is naturally set in this context by the metallicity of the cosmic web gas at the present time , which is predicted to be around the observed limit ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the scenario also explains why xmps tend to be cometary .",
    "the impacting gas clouds have the largest effect on the outskirts of galaxies where the ambient pressure and column density are low . for most orientations of the galaxy , this gives a cometary shape ( like figs .",
    "[ example ] and [ example2 ] ) .",
    "if our scenario is correct , xmps should not be regarded as pristine galaxies but as objects that are still forming in the nearby universe .",
    "their gas traces the intergalactic medium in their immediate surrounding , providing a new method to characterize the cosmic web .",
