    "the general interest in networks of man - made and natural systems has lead to a careful analysis of various network instances using empirical , simulational , and theoretical tools .",
    "the emergence of this field is sometimes referred to as the birth of network science @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we use complex network concepts to analyze the statistical properties of public transport networks ( ptn ) of large cities .",
    "these constitute an example of transportation networks @xcite and share general features of these systems : evolutionary dynamics , optimization , embedding in two dimensional ( 2d ) space .",
    "other examples of transportation networks are given by the airport @xcite , railway @xcite , or power grid networks @xcite .",
    "routes and @xmath0 stations , some of them are shown in this map ( color online ) .",
    "[ fig1],width=302 ]    while the evolution of a ptn of a given city is closely related to the city growth itself and therefore is influenced by numerous factors of geographical , historical , and social origin , there is ample evidence that ptns of different cities share common statistical properties that arise due to their functional purposes @xcite .",
    "some of these properties have been analyzed in former studies , however , the objective of the present study is to present a comprehensive survey of characteristics of ptns and to provide a comparative analysis .",
    "based on this empirical survey we are in the position to propose a growth model that captures many of the main ( statistical ) features of ptns .",
    "a further distinct feature of our study is that the ptns we will consider are networks of _ all _ means of public transport of a city ( buses , trams , subway , etc . )",
    "regardless of the specific means of transport . a number of studies have analyzed specific sub - networks of ptns @xcite .",
    "examples are the boston @xcite and vienna @xcite subway networks and the bus networks of several cities in china @xcite .",
    "however , each particular traffic system ( e.g. the network of buses or trams , or the subway network ) is not a closed system : it is a subgraph of a wider transportation system of a city , or as we call it here , of a ptn . therefore to understand and describe the properties of public transport in a city as a whole",
    ", one should analyze the complete network , without restriction to specific parts .",
    "indeed , for the case of boston it has been shown that changing from the subway system to the network  subway + bus \" the network properties change drastically @xcite .",
    "urban public transport networks of general type have so far been analyzed mainly in two previous studies @xcite . in the first one , ref .",
    "@xcite , the ptns of berlin , dsseldorf , and paris were examined , whereas the subject of ref .",
    "@xcite were public transport systems of 22 polish cities .",
    "@xcite concentrated on the scale - free properties .",
    "for the cities considered , the node degree distribution was shown to follow a power law .",
    "moreover power laws were found for a number of other specific features describing the traffic load on the ptn . however , the statistics in this study was too small for definite conclusions . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was found that the node degree distribution may follow a power law or be described by an exponential function , depending on the assumed network representation . besides , a number of other network characteristics ( clustering , betweenness , assortativity ) were extensively analyzed .    in the present paper , we analyze ptns of a number of major cities of the world ( see table [ tab1 ] ) @xcite .",
    "our choice for this data base was motivated by the requirement to collect network samples from cities of different geographical , cultural , and economical background .",
    "our current analysis extends former studies @xcite by considering cities with larger public transport systems ( the typical number of stops in the systems considered in ref .",
    "@xcite was several hundreds ) as well as by systematically analyzing different representations .",
    "the idea of different network representations naturally arises in the network science @xcite . for the ptn",
    "the primary network topology is given by the set of routes each servicing an ordered series of given stations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] as an example ) . for the transportation networks studied so far mainly two different neighborhood relations were used . in the first one ,",
    "two stations are defined as neighbors only if one station is the successor of the other in the series serviced by this route @xcite .",
    "in the second one , two stations are neighbors whenever they are serviced by a common route @xcite .",
    "we will exploit both representations in our study .",
    "moreover , we introduce further natural representations ( described in detail in section [ ii ] ) which make the description of the ptns of table [ tab1 ] comprehensive . in particular , this includes a bipartite graph representation of a transportation network that reflects its intrinsic features @xcite .",
    "1.5 mm    .cities analyzed in this study .",
    "@xmath1 : urban area ( km@xmath2 ) ; @xmath3 : population ( million inhabitants ) ; @xmath4 : number of ptn stations ; @xmath5 : number of ptn routes ; @xmath6 : mean route length .",
    "type of transport which is taken into account in the ptn database : bus , electric trolleybus , ferry , subway , tram , urban train . [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      let us first investigate the global topology of this model as function of its parameters .",
    "we first fix both the number of routes @xmath5 and the number of stations @xmath6 per route as well as the size of the lattice @xmath7 .",
    "this leaves us with essentially two parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 , eqs .",
    "( [ 6.1 ] ) , ( [ 6.2 ] ) .",
    "dependencies on @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 will be studied below .    for the real - world ptns as studied in the previous sections , almost all stations belong to a single component , gcc , with the possible exception of a very small number of routes . within the network",
    "however we often observe what above we called the harness effect of several routes proceeding in parallel for a sequence of stations .",
    "let us first investigate from a global point of view which parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 reproduce realistic maps of ptns . in fig .",
    "[ fig17 ] we show simulated ptns on lattices @xmath10 for @xmath11 , @xmath12 and different values of the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "each route is represented by a continuous line tracing the path along its sequence of stations . for representation purposes ,",
    "parallel routes are shown slightly shifted .",
    "thus , the line thickness and intensity of colors indicate the density of the routes .",
    "parameter @xmath9 governs the evolution of each single subsequent route .",
    "if @xmath13 each subsequent route is restricted to follow the previous one .",
    "the change of simulated ptns with @xmath9 for fixed @xmath14 is shown in the first row of fig .",
    "[ fig17 ] . for small values of @xmath15",
    "the ptns obtained result in almost all routes following the same path with only a few deviations .",
    "increasing @xmath9 from @xmath16 to @xmath17 the area covered by the routes increases while the majority of the routes are concentrated on a small number of paths .",
    "further increasing @xmath9 to @xmath18 and beyond we find a wider distributed coverage with the central part of the network remaining the most densely covered area .",
    "this is due to the non - equilibrium growth process described by eqs .",
    "( [ 6.1 ] ) , ( [ 6.2 ] ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath8 quantifies the possibility to start a new route outside the existing network . for vanishing @xmath14",
    "the resulting network always consists of a single connected component , while for finite values of @xmath8 a few or many disconnected components may occur .",
    "the results found for @xmath14 and varying @xmath9 parameters are completely independent of the lattice size @xmath7 provided @xmath7 is sufficiently large .",
    "when introducing a finite @xmath8 parameter , however , new routes may be started anywhere on the lattice which results in a strong lattice size dependency . to partly compensate for this",
    ", the impact of @xmath8 has been normalized by @xmath19 in ( [ 6.1 ] ) .",
    "the dependence of the simulated ptn maps on @xmath8 for fixed @xmath18 is shown in the second row of fig .",
    "[ fig17 ] . for @xmath20",
    "one observes the formation of a single large cluster with only a few individual routes occurring outside this cluster .",
    "slightly increasing @xmath8 beyond @xmath21 one finds a sharp transition to a situation with several ( two or more ) clusters . for much larger values of @xmath8",
    "the number of clusters further increases and the situation becomes more and more homogeneous : the routes tend to cover all available lattice space area .",
    "* a *        * a *    from the above qualitative investigation we conclude that realistic ptn maps are obtained for small or vanishing @xmath8 and @xmath22 .",
    "to quantitatively investigate the behavior of the simulated networks on their parameters including @xmath5 and @xmath6 let us now compare their statistical characteristics with those we have empirically obtained for the real - world networks . in table",
    "[ tab5 ] we have chosen to list the same characteristics of the simulated ptn as they are displayed for the real - world networks in table [ tab2 ] . to provide for additional checks of the correlations between simulated and real - world networks , we present the characteristics in all @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25-spaces .",
    "let us note that our choice of the underlying grid to be a square lattice limits the number of nearest neighbors of a given station in @xmath23-space to @xmath26 .",
    "moreover , as far as no direct links between these neighbors occur , the clustering coefficient in @xmath23-space vanishes , @xmath27 .",
    "nonetheless , as we discuss below , both characteristics display nontrivial behavior similar to real - world networks when displayed in @xmath24 and @xmath25-spaces .    for reasons explained above",
    "we choose a vanishing parameter @xmath14 and @xmath18 and for comparison @xmath28 .",
    "the data shown in the table was obtained for simulated ptns of different numbers of routes , @xmath29 and route lengths @xmath30 . in the range of parameters covered in the table",
    "we observe only weak changes of the various characteristics .",
    "natural trends are that with the increase of the number of routes @xmath5 the maximal and mean shortest path length increases in all spaces .",
    "most pronounced this is observed in @xmath23-space , while it is weakest in @xmath25-space . a similar increase is observed in @xmath23-space when increasing the number of stations @xmath6 per route . choosing the values of @xmath5 in the range @xmath31 and @xmath32 ,",
    "@xmath33 the average and maximal values of the characteristics studied here are found within the ranges seen for real - world ptns , see table [ tab2 ] .",
    "more detailed information is contained in the distributions of these characteristics and their correlations .",
    "we restrict the further discussion to simulated ptns described by @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath14 , @xmath18 , which appear to reproduce many of the characteristics of real - world ptns . in figure [ fig18 ]",
    "we display the mean shortest path length distribution for these selected ptns in @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25-spaces .",
    "in @xmath23-space we observe two groups of distributions which correspond to the two route lengths @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the most probable values for the path length @xmath36 being of the order of the corresponding @xmath6 . in @xmath24 and @xmath25-spaces the distributions are very similar with most probable path lengths @xmath37 , @xmath38 . in all cases the distributions",
    "are well fitted by the asymmetric unimodal distribution ( [ 4.3 ] ) and resemble those of the real - world networks shown in fig .",
    "varying @xmath39 does not significantly change this picture .        *",
    "a *         * a *    let us now examine the node degree distributions of the simulated ptns selected above .",
    "as explained above , the @xmath23-space degrees are restricted by the geometry of the underlying square lattice .",
    "thus of the representations discussed here one may observe non - trivial distributions only in @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath40-spaces .",
    "[ fig19]*a * shows the cumulative node degree distribution in @xmath24-space in semi - logarithmic scale .",
    "recall that for the majority of real - world ptns studied in section [ iii ] as well as in other works @xcite , the @xmath24-space node degree distribution was found to decay exponentially .",
    "all distributions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig19]*a * display two regions each governed by an exponential decay with a separate scale .",
    "note that increasing both @xmath6 and @xmath5 leads to an increase of the ranges over which these regions extend . comparing these results with those of fig .",
    "[ fig4]*b * for real - world ptns we find that all ranges observed there are also reproduced here . within",
    "the parameter ranges chosen here the current model does not seem to attain a power law node degree distribution in @xmath24-space .    comparing the@xmath25-space node degree distributions for real - world and simulated ptns ( figs .",
    "[ fig4]*c * and [ fig19]*b * , correspondingly ) one finds a definite tendency to an exponential behavior with two different scales in both cases .",
    "note however that for the simulated ptns the scales increase with the number of routes @xmath5 while they decrease with the number of stations per route @xmath6 .",
    "the simulated results discussed so far concerned data obtained for individual instances of modeled ptns .",
    "one of the reasons for this was to reduce the computational effort required for the calculation of path lengths , betweennesses , and related global characteristics . furthermore ,",
    "in particular for the simulations involving high number of routes some self averaging may be expected to occur .",
    "the latter assumption was tested and verified by ( i ) simulating a reasonable set of ptns with the same choice of parameters and ( ii ) by performing large - scale simulations calculating local characteristics .",
    "a result of the latter procedure involving averages over up to @xmath41 instances of simulated networks is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig20]*a*. there we show the node degree distribution of the station nodes in @xmath40-space , i.e. the bipartite network of routes and stations with the inherent neighborhood relation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . as can be seen in the double logarithmic plot shown in fig .",
    "[ fig20]*a * a power - law like behavior of this distribution that extends over a wider range is found for small values of the parameter @xmath9 .",
    "this corresponds to a situation where one finds many routes to proceed in parallel ( compare with the maps shown in fig .",
    "[ fig17 ] ) . for the more realistic choices of the @xmath9 parameter the overall behavior of this distribution",
    "is described by an exponential decay .",
    "the scale of this decay strongly depends on @xmath9 .",
    "[ fig20]*b * shows that similar distributions for the real cities have oscillating character , which is caused by the fact that non - cumulative distributions are plotted .",
    "similarly , individual distributions for simulated ptns are in general non - monotonous , however the large number average of the distribution appears to be monotonously decreasing . nevertheless , comparing plots in figs .",
    "[ fig20]*a * and [ fig20]*b * one sees that in general the model is capable to reproduce the global decay properties of the station node degree distributions in @xmath40-space .    in fig .",
    "[ fig21 ] we show the betweenness - degree correlation for the simulated ptn with @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath14 , and @xmath18 .",

    "[ fig21]*a * - [ fig21]*c * qualitatively reproduce the behavior of @xmath45 observed for the real world networks in @xmath25 , @xmath24 , and @xmath40-spaces . @xmath23-space behavior can not be reproduced due to the restrictions caused by the geometry of the underlying square lattice .    in figs .",
    "[ fig22]*a * and [ fig22]*b * we plot the cumulative harness distributions @xmath46 for two simulated networks with @xmath47 , @xmath33 , @xmath14 and different values of parameter @xmath9 : @xmath17 ( fig .",

    "[ fig22]*b*. a prominent feature demonstrated by fig .",
    "[ fig22 ] is that one can tune the decay regime by changing the parameter @xmath9 . for small values of @xmath9",

    "this is reflected by a power - law decay of the distribution .",

    "this is especially evident if one includes into the the comparison different network representations ( different spaces ) as performed above .",
    "this paper was driven by two main objectives towards the analysis of urban public transport networks .",
    "first , we wanted to present a comprehensive survey of statistical properties of ptns based on the data for cities of so far unexplored network size ( see table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "based on this survey , the second objective was to present a model that albeit being simple enough is capable to reproduce a majority of these properties .    especially helpful in our analysis was the use of different network representations ( different spaces , introduced in section [ ii ] ) . whereas former ptn studies used some of these representations , here within a comprehensive approach we calculate ptn characteristics as they show up in @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath40-spaces .",
    "it is the comparative analysis of empirical data in different spaces that enabled , in particular , an adequate ptn modeling presented in section [ vi ] .",
    "the networks under consideration appear to be strongly correlated small - world structures with high values of clustering coefficients ( especially in @xmath23 and less in @xmath25-spaces ) and comparatively low mean shortest path values , as listed in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "standard network characteristics listed there correspond to the features a passenger is interested in when using public traffic in a given city . to give several examples , any two stops in paris are on the average separated by @xmath49 stations ( with a maximal value of @xmath50 ) and to travel between them one on average",
    "should do @xmath51 changes .",
    "evidence of correlations present in ptns are the power - law node degree distributions observed for many networks in @xmath23 and for some in @xmath24-space ( see table [ tab3 ] ) .",
    "currently , we find no explanation why some of the networks of our survey are governed by power - law node degree distributions whereas others follow an exponential decay . in the analysis of urban street networks",
    "a classification has been found @xcite that allows to discriminate between properties of different classes of city organization .",
    "let us note however that as a rule the latter analysis is performed for restricted regions of street networks i.e. either the historical or the suburban part .",
    "in the case of a ptn , however , one usually deals with a structure that spreads over all the city , covering both the inner and outer regions .    besides looking on traditional network characteristics ( as described in sections",
    "[ iii ] - [ v ] ) we addressed here a specific feature which is unique for ptns and networks with similar construction principles .",
    "namely , we analyzed statistical distributions of public transport routes that go in parallel for a sequence of stations .",
    "as we have shown such distributions ( we call them harness distributions ) are well defined for the networks under consideration and may be also be used for a quantitative description of similar networks embedded in 2d or 3d space as cables , pipes , neurons , or ( blood- ) vessels , etc .",
    "the common statistical features of the networks considered emerge due to their common functional purposes and construction principles also reflected in the underlying bipartite structure @xcite .",
    "it is this structure that explains parts of the correlations present in ptns @xcite .",
    "the network growth model we present in section [ vi ] captures this structure describing network evolution in terms of adding public transport routes , each of them being a complete graph in @xmath24-space .",
    "our choice to use a self avoiding walk ( saw ) as a route model in lattice simulations was motivated by geographical observations and other reasons , as argued in section [ vi ] . in support of the scaling argument given there",
    ", one may note that the fractal dimension of a saw on a lattice does not change if a weak uncorrelated disorder is present , i.e. when some lattice sites can not be visited @xcite . in turn",
    ", this tells that the model is robust with respect to weak disturbances of the underlying lattice structure",
    ". further analysis of simulated ptns performed in section [ vi ] established strong similarities in the statistical characteristics of simulated and real - world networks .    obviously , the two objectives in the ptn study we have so far achieved in this paper - the empirical analysis and the modeling - naturally call for an analytic approach . in particular , such approach may be used in parallel with numerical simulations to derive statistical properties of the model proposed in section [ vi ] .",
    "this will be a task for forthcoming studies .",
    "another natural continuation of this work will be to analyze different possibly dynamic phenomena that may occur on and with ptns .",
    "a particular task will be to study robustness of ptns to targeted attacks and random failures @xcite .",

    "<S> we use complex network concepts to analyze statistical properties of urban public transport networks ( ptn ) . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , we present a comprehensive survey of the statistical properties of ptns based on the data of fourteen cities of so far unexplored network size . especially helpful in our analysis </S>",
    "<S> are different network representations . within a comprehensive approach </S>",
    "<S> we calculate ptn characteristics in all of these representations and perform a comparative analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the standard network characteristics obtained in this way often correspond to features that are of practical importance to a passenger using public traffic in a given city . </S>",
    "<S> specific features are addressed that are unique to ptns and networks with similar transport functions ( such as networks of neurons , cables , pipes , vessels embedded in 2d or 3d space ) . </S>",
    "<S> based on the empirical survey , we propose a model that albeit being simple enough is capable of reproducing many of the identified ptn properties . </S>",
    "<S> a central ingredient of this model is a growth dynamics in terms of routes represented by self - avoiding walks . </S>"
