    "most individual level network oriented studies ask respondents to recall their own direct social ties . cognitive social structure ( css ) based studies on the other hand , collect data not only on the actor s own relations , but also his / her perception of social ties among all other actors in the network . in complete css designs for networks of size @xmath0 ,",
    "each respondent is required to answer questions about @xmath1 possible relations in the network .",
    "formalized by david krackhardt ( 1987 ) , css scholarship mostly centers around determinants of accuracy of network cognition such as personality traits , ( casciaro , 1998 ; casciaro et al .",
    "1999 ) , power ( krackhardt , 1990 ; simpson et al .",
    "2011 ) , need for closure and homophily ( flyn et al , 2010 ) , social exclusion ( oconnor and gladstone , 2015 ) , network centrality ( krackhardt , 1987 ; grippa and gloor , 2009 ; simpson and borch , 2005 ) , and egocentric biases ( kumbasar et al . , 1994 ; johnson and orbach , 2002 ) .",
    "this paper deviates from traditional css studies and aims at ( 1 ) presenting a tool for css researchers to classify and analyze different errors of perception , and ( 2 ) providing a new network estimation method that is designed to minimize overall errors while controlling for different error types .",
    "the method is based on randomly selected css slices ( actors perception matrices ) and therefore does not require high response rates to estimate the network structure .",
    "the proposed density weighted receiving operator characteristic ( roc ) curve based method is shown to produce network estimates with relatively low errors .",
    "moreover , this new method provides a decision tool for researchers for determining the threshold @xmath2 ( the minimum required number of actors claiming the presence of a tie to assign a tie between two actors in the estimated network ) that enables them to visually inspect the distribution of errors at every level of @xmath2 .",
    "the recognition of error variation in data collection is likely to benefit network scholars in areas in which costs of making an error of omission or commission may be significantly different .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in section [ types ] we introduce the five data sets we consider and present summaries of different error types in individuals perceptions . in section",
    "[ estimation ] we propose a network estimation method controlling these error types . section [ numerical ] reports the results of a numerical study for evaluating the performance of the proposed estimation methodology , and section [ conclusion ] concludes .",
    "the paper is accompanied by an r package , ` csstools ` ( yenign et al .",
    "2016 ) , that allows users to manage and dissect css data and to estimate networks based on random samples of css slices .",
    "to date most css based studies conceptualized errors as absent or present , only very few studies looked at the specific type of perception errors , and to our knowledge none compared the relationship between error types .",
    "for example , based on an experimental study oconnor and gladstone ( 2015 ) found that experience of social exclusion leads to false positives , in other words , errors of commission .",
    "flyn et al . (",
    "2010 ) showed that need for closure is also associated with false positives due to respondents tendency to perceive transitive ties . in another experimental study dessi",
    "et al . ( 2016 ) showed that individuals tended to underestimate mean degree of the networks that they were asked to recall during the experiments .    unlike this line of research ,",
    "we first conceptualize and assess cognitive errors as type 1 ( errors of commission , or false positives ) and type 2 ( errors of omission , or false negatives ) , and examine the relationship between the two types of cognitive inaccuracy and their association with overall respondent reliability .",
    "to be more specific , we define type 1 error as an instance of error when an individual perceives there to be a tie between two actors when in fact there is no tie , and type 2 error as an instance when perception says there is no tie when in fact there is a tie .",
    "we use the following five data sets to analyze the errors and test our estimation technique : ( 1 ) high tech managers : 21 managers in a machinery firm ( krackhardt , 1987 ) ; ( 2 ) silicon systems : 36 semiskilled production and service workers from a small entrepreneurial firm ( krackhardt , 1990 ) ; ( 3 ) pacific distributers : 33 key personnel from the headquarters of a logistics company ( krackhardt and kilduff , 1990 ) ; ( 4 ) government office : 36 government employees at the federal level ( krackhardt and kilduff , 1999 ) ; and ( 5 ) italian university : 25 researchers across partner research centers at a university ( casciaro , 1998 ) .",
    "all five data sets are collected according to the css method , where each actor not only reports his or her self - ties , but also answers questions on all possible dyads in the network .",
    "a css for a network involving @xmath0 individuals is usually represented by a three dimensional array @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) , where @xmath5 is the sender , @xmath6 is the receiver , and @xmath7 is the perceiver of the relationship ( krackhardt , 1987 ) . as mentioned avbove , an actor s network perception matrix is referred to as a css slice .",
    "based on the work of krackhardt ( 1990 ) , for a given css array we construct the true network using the locally aggregate structures ( las ) intersection rule , according to which a tie is considered to be present in the true network if and only if both parties in a dyad report the tie . note that these ties considered in the networks are directional , and thus for the @xmath5-@xmath6 tie to exist , @xmath5 must claim to send a tie to @xmath6 , and @xmath6 must claim to receive a tie from @xmath5 .",
    "after constructing the true network in this fashion , we explore the different types of errors in perceptions .",
    ".summary statistics for error rates across five data sets . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     figure [ fig : illustration]-a illustrates the classical roc curve produced by varying @xmath2 from 0 to @xmath8 , along with the value of @xmath2 at each step .",
    "we may see that when @xmath9 , the curve is closest to top left corner , i.e. , @xmath10 is minimized at this point .",
    "figure [ fig : illustration]-b indicates the actual number of type 1 and type 2 errors committed for each @xmath2 .",
    "we may see that when @xmath9 we commit 26 type 1 errors out of 88 possible instances ( @xmath11 ) , and one type 2 error out of 12 possible instances ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the potential drawback here is that the classical roc approach minimizing @xmath10 assigns equal importance to both error types , and it gives the optimal @xmath2 based on error rates , not the actual counts .",
    "however , in low density networks reducing type 1 error may be more critical compared to type 2 error rate since the true network contains much more zeroes than ones , creating much more potential type 1 error instances .",
    "this can be easily seen in figure [ fig : illustration]-b , where increasing @xmath2 from one to two reduces the type 1 error count by 13 at the expense of only three type 2 error counts , and similarly for the next increment of @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , we consider a weighted distance @xmath13 to be minimized in the roc analysis ,    @xmath14    where a choice of @xmath15 gives more emphasis on type 1 error , a choice of @xmath16 gives more emphasis on type 2 error , and the choice of @xmath17 corresponds to classical roc distance @xmath10 . based on our observation on the effect of network density on the potential error rates , we propose that @xmath18 is a reasonable choice of @xmath19 for the low density networks , where @xmath20 is the average density of all css slices in the random sample . in the illustrative example",
    "@xmath21 , so we set @xmath22 .",
    "as marked in figure [ fig : illustration]-a ( as well as in table [ tab : illustration ] ) , when @xmath23 the minimum @xmath13 is attained for @xmath24 , which produces a type 1 error rate of @xmath25 and type 2 error rate of @xmath26 . then employing ftm with @xmath24",
    "is considered to give a better estimate of the unknown network based on the sample information . as an evidence of the improvement in estimation",
    ", we note that when @xmath10 is minimized ( @xmath9 ) the correlation between the estimated network and the true network is 0.644 , however , when @xmath13 is minimized ( @xmath24 ) the correlation is 0.749 . here",
    "we also note that the correlation measure we use in this study is the similarity index @xmath27 suggested by krackhardt ( 1990 ) .",
    "_ proposed estimation method _    based on our observations on the above illustrative example , as well as our investigation on other data sets , we observed that the roc approach is a powerful one for estimating networks from a random sample of css slices since it seeks for a balance between the committed type 1 and type 2 errors .",
    "we also observed that giving more emphasis on type 1 error rate improves the estimation in sparse networks .",
    "therefore , we control the level of this emphasis to be inversely proportional to the average density of the observed css slices",
    ". our estimation method is summarized in the following algorithm . in what follows",
    ", we will refer to this method as the _ roc based threshold method _ ( rtm ) .",
    "0.5     0.5     _ rtm algorithm : network estimation form css slices , controlling both type 1 and type 2 error rates _    1 .",
    "draw a random sample of size @xmath28 and observe the css slices .",
    "calculate the average density @xmath20 of all css slices in the sample , and set @xmath18 .",
    "3 .   perform the weighted roc analysis to find the @xmath2 such that @xmath13 is minimized , and denote it by @xmath29 .",
    "4 .   compute the estimated network by aggregating the css slices using ftm with threshold @xmath29 .    as will be illustrated in the following section ,",
    "our numerical study across five data sets indicate that setting the weight to @xmath18 is a reasonable choice .",
    "however , for various reasons , a researcher might want to use a different weight , and our roc based methodology may be employed for any choice of @xmath19 .",
    "this may be needed for certain social networks such as terrorist networks in which costs of type 2 errors may be considered to be significantly larger than type 1 errors .",
    "we finalize this section by noting that ftm , atm , and rtm algorithms may be implemented by the functions ` ftm ` , ` atm ` and ` rtm ` , respectively , in the ` csstools ` package for the statistical software r. the illustrative high tech managers data set is also included in the package , along with functions for producing tables and figures similar to table [ tab : illustration ] and figure [ fig : illustration ] , and some useful tools for the analysis of css data .",
    "in this section we present the results of a numerical study aiming to illustrate the performance of the proposed estimation methodology . since the adaptive threshold method ( atm ) of siciliano et al .",
    "( 2012 ) for estimating networks from a random sample of css slices is known to outperform traditional roster and ego network methods , we only compare the proposed roc based adaptive threshold methodology ( rtm ) with atm . for each data set introduced in section [ types ] , we generate random samples of sizes 4 to @xmath0 , estimate the network based on the sample information only , and compute the correlation ( @xmath27 ) between the estimated network and the true network obtained by the intersection method .",
    "our results across five data sets are displayed in figures [ fig : italian_cor ] to [ fig : pacific_cor ] , which display the boxplots of the observed correlations for different estimation methods . in each plot",
    ", the horizontal axis represents the sample size , the vertical axis represents the correlation , and the boxplots illustrate the distribution of the observed correlations based on 1000 simulations . in other words",
    ", for each sample size the vertical boxes represent the middle 50@xmath30 , and the vertical lines represent the lower and upper 25@xmath30 of the distribution of the observed correlations between the true and estimated networks .",
    "the colors indicate the method used for estimation .",
    "we may see from the figures that the overall performances of both methods considered seem to be satisfactory .",
    "as expected , for all data sets and methods , the correlation between the estimated and true networks increase as the sample size increases , and when all individuals are included in the sample the correlation equals one .",
    "the performances of the two methods considered seem to be comparable , however , atm turns out to be sensitive to the selection of tolerable type 1 error rate @xmath31 . when using atm , setting @xmath31 to a larger value such as 0.15 generally seem to be a poor selection , which is most visible for silicon systems and pacific distributers data sets ( figures [ fig : silicon_cor ] and [ fig : pacific_cor ] , respectively ) .",
    "this is an expected result as too much type 1 error is allowed in the estimation procedure . on the other extreme ,",
    "setting @xmath31 to a smaller value such as 0.01 seems to produce better results across most data sets , however , as we see in pacific distributers data for small to moderate sample sizes , choice of 0.15 may outperform choice of 0.01",
    ". this may be because of the fact that forcing to reduce type 1 error to a great extent may trigger more type 2 errors and thus result in a larger overall error rate .",
    "across the five data sets considered , setting @xmath31 to 0.05 or 0.10 seem to be safer , but this feature can not be generalized to any data set . in short , a researcher to employ atm may be advised to set @xmath31 to 0.05 or 0.10 , but , they must also be advised that these are the preferable levels for the five data sets investigated , and it is not guaranteed that they will be the best choices for any data set .    on the other hand , the proposed rtm performs as good as atm with a good choice of @xmath31 , and it provides consistent results across all data sets . in this sense",
    "it is a robust method for estimating networks , and the fact that it does nt require a pre - determined decision threshold such as @xmath31 is appealing .",
    "rtm has an automatic way of balancing type 1 and type 2 errors , and our numerical study shows that its estimation performance is comparable with atm , even when the atm user is assumed to choose the best @xmath31 level .",
    "we first presented the common patterns of errors across five css data sets .",
    "consistent in all data sets is the strong negative association between type 1 and type 2 errors . for the individuals with lower overall errors , most of the errors are of type 2 , whereas for the individuals with higher overall errors most of the errors are of type 1 . due to low density of the true networks considered ,",
    "a common feature in many social networks , the uninformed perceivers tend to make much more type 1 errors .",
    "these findings have especially important implications for measurement of network data , hence investigation of the determinants of tendency for different error types may be a useful next step in css research .",
    "next , we presented a novel estimation method , rtm , which requires a sample of css slices from the network of interest , and returns an estimate of the network while controlling for both type 1 and type 2 errors .",
    "rtm utilizes the roc curve for balancing two error types , and it does not require a user decision on any cut - off values ( such as @xmath31 of atm ) .",
    "our comparative numerical study shows that the proposed method performs well .",
    "rtm gives weights to error types based on the network density , however , researchers may also choose to set their preferred weights depending on the emphasis they need to give to error types depending on their consequences .",
    "using rtm , it is possible to incorporate network data collection to random survey studies covering multiple organizations .",
    "likewise more scholars are recognizing the need to study organization networks at multiple levels ( brass et al .",
    "2004 ; zappa and lomi , 2015 ; tranmer et al . ,",
    "2016 ) , however , data collection requirements are extremely demanding for studying inter - organizational and intra - organization networks simultaneously .",
    "rtm provides a convenient approach to meet data requirements for multi level organization research as well .",
    "one limitation of rtm is the network size . due to obvious individual cognitive limitations",
    ", it may not be wise to apply rtm to networks involving more than 70 individuals . for large networks ,",
    "a clustered version of rtm that is based on major departments or units in organizations can be considered .    despite the promise of random sampling , gathering complete network data on the actors under study",
    "remains the best and recommended approach for collecting network data .",
    "we see these methods as useful when a researcher expects or obtains a low response rate or when the scope of the study prohibits the collection of network data from all participants , such as one looking at networks in a large number of organizations .",
