    "the possible existence of an elementary fermionic particle with the distinguishing property of being its own antiparticle @xmath2 a majorana fermion @xmath2 remains an outstanding puzzle , almost 80 years after the idea was first advanced @xcite .",
    "by contrast , _ emergent _ majorana fermions are well known to appear in disguise in condensed matter systems @xmath2 the bogoliubov quasiparticle in a superconductor being a notable example @xcite .",
    "different , and more intriguing , is the concept of an emergent quasiparticle which is its own antiparticle but exhibits non - abelian statistics @xcite @xmath2 a _ majorana zero - energy mode _ ( mzm ) , bound to a defect or a boundary @xcite .",
    "possible hosts for these particles are fractional quantum hall systems @xcite , cold gases of fermionic atoms @xcite and topological superconductors in 1d @xcite and 2d @xcite .",
    "as first realized by fu and kane @xcite , the required spinless @xmath0-wave pairing which makes a superconductor topological may be engineered in a semiconductor structure hybridized with an ordinary @xmath1-wave superconductor .",
    "this has made the topological superconductors the preferred hunting grounds for mzms @xcite , and there is now a variety of theoretical proposals for how to access them in the laboratory .",
    "two schemes , both for proximity - induced 1d @xmath0-wave pairing , have so far been explored in experiments : a rashba spin - orbit coupled quantum wire in proximity to an @xmath1-wave superconductor and subject to a magnetic field @xcite , and a setup with a chain of magnetic impurities deposited on top of an @xmath1-wave superconductor @xcite . while the experimental results are promising @xcite , the verdict is still out as to whether any of them unambigously points to mzms .    to produce a topological superconducting state in one dimension ,",
    "the basic trick is to make the fermi level cross only a single spin - split quasiparticle band . with this , the pairing of the resulting helical ( spin - momentum locked ) states must then effectively have @xmath0-wave symmetry so as to make the pair wave function antisymmetric @xcite . in the quantum wire proposals of refs .",
    ", the trick is carried out by combining a strong rashba spin - orbit interaction ( which causes the spin splitting ) with a zeeman interaction ( which pushes one of the bands away from the fermi level ) . in the more recent scenario with a magnetic impurity chain on top of an @xmath1-wave superconductor @xcite",
    ", the microscopic spin texture of the chain emulates a combined rashba and zeeman interaction to effectively produce a protected set of one - dimensional @xmath0-wave states in the surface layer of the superconductor .",
    "while this latter setup has an advantage in allowing for stm probes of the predicted mzms , it is more difficult to manipulate and control , and therefore probably less useful for future applications . the quantum wire setup , on the other hand , is easily controllable , with tunable gate voltages that may be used to move around the mzms in networks of quantum wires @xmath2 as envisioned in certain architectures for topological quantum gates @xcite .",
    "a potential drawback of the quantum wire setup , however , is the reliance on a magnetic field .",
    "while the strength of the field can be varied , and allows to tune across the topological quantum phase transition @xmath2 in this way uncovering experimental signatures of the mzms @xmath2 its presence also makes the device less robust against disorder @xcite",
    ". moreover , magnetic fields of the required strengths are difficult to apply locally @xcite , and therefore , integrating them into useful designs for quantum computing with mzms may prove a challenge .",
    "this is particularly so since a universal set of quantum gates @xcite using mzms is obtainable only by supplying ancillary nontopological states @xcite . these states ,",
    "in turn , may become fragile when subject to a magnetic field . a case in point",
    "is when the ancillary states are taken to be spin qubits , as in the proposal in ref . .",
    "to ensure spin degeneracy , the magnetic field must here be precisely tuned , with the spin - up and spin - down states belonging to different orbitals in the quantum dot which hosts them .",
    "this sets additional demands on the experimental setup . from a more fundamental point of view",
    ", one asks whether there could be a less invasive way to obtain 1d helical electrons ( the prerequisite for @xmath0-wave superconductivity ) than breaking time reversal symmetry explicitly , as is the case with magnetic field - based proposals .    in view of this , it is interesting to inquire whether mzms may be produced in a quantum wire ( or network of wires as required for braiding and quantum information processing ) using an all - electric scheme , disposing of the magnetic field altogether .",
    "in fact , there is already an abundance of theoretical proposals which employ  non - magnetic \" schemes : @xmath3 @xcite or @xmath4-wave proximity pairing @xcite , noncentrosymmetric superconductivity @xcite , two - channel quantum wires with channel - dependent spin - orbit interactions @xcite , or some other mechanism @xcite .",
    "common to these proposals is that they describe quasi-1d (  multichannel \" ) topological superconductors @xcite , hosting _",
    "paired _ mzms at each end of the wire ( `` majorana kramers pairs '' ) @xcite . in this work",
    "we shall instead explore the possibility to generate _ unpaired _ mzms at the ends of a _ single - channel _ proximity - coupled quantum wire without applying a magnetic field . in our proposed setup ,",
    "the breaking of time - reversal symmetry ( necessary to escape the time - reversal analog of  fermion doubling \" in 1d @xcite and obtain helical electron states ) is _ spontaneous _ , and comes about from an interplay between a spatially modulated spin - orbit interaction and the electron - electron ( e - e ) repulsion .",
    "as we shall show , this makes possible a magnetic field - free 1d topological superconductor with a single unpaired mzm at each end of the wire . to the best of our knowledge , schemes for producing unpaired mzms without the use of a magnetic field has so far been discussed only for especially coupled double - nanowires or multichannel wires @xcite , and for floquet topological superconductors with a periodic high - frequency driving of the spin - orbit interaction @xcite . here , we instead make use of a _ spatially _ periodic rashba spin - orbit interaction in a _ single _ quantum wire .",
    "specifically , we shall build on a recent proposal of ours , where a 1d helical system is engineered using a quantum wire subject to a periodically modulated electric field @xcite .",
    "the electric field gives rise to a spatially modulated rashba spin - orbit interaction , which , when assisted by e - e interactions and a uniform dresselhaus spin - orbit interaction , opens a gap at two of the spin - orbit shifted fermi points .",
    "as an outcome , a helical luttinger liquid ( hll ) @xcite emerges at the two remaining gapless fermi points . in the present work we inquire about the conditions under which the proximity of an ordinary @xmath1-wave superconductor could turn this hll into a 1d spinless @xmath0-wave superconductor hosting mzms .",
    "the problem becomes nontrivial considering that the induced superconducting pairing competes with the insulating gap - opening process from the modulated rashba interaction . using a perturbative renormalization group ( rg ) argument , we shall find that both processes _ can _ play out concurrently .",
    "this establishes a  proof - of - concept \" that a single - channel quantum wire may host unpaired mzms without the assistance of a magnetic field ( or a high - frequency driving of the spin - orbit interaction @xcite ) .",
    "however , a case study with an inas - based device shows that the required values of the parameters lie outside the experimental range reported for inas quantum wells . a variant of our scheme with a cold - atom emulation of a quantum wire @xmath2 where interacting and spin - orbit coupled fermionic atoms are in contact with a bec reservoir of feshbach molecules @xmath2 looks more promising .",
    "we shall elaborate on this and argue that a spinless @xmath0-wave superfluid phase with unpaired mzms is well supported by a cold atom platform within the parameter regime where our scheme is workable .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce a microscopic model for a spin - orbit coupled and periodically gated quantum wire in proximity to an @xmath1-wave superconductor and advance , through general arguments , that this system may be turned into a spinless @xmath0-wave superconductor .",
    "as mentioned above , the scheme calls for the assistance of e - e interactions and this is discussed in sec .",
    "iii through a low - energy effective description of the model .",
    "bosonizing the theory , we then carry out a detailed rg study which allows us to establish the flow equations of the theory in the various parameter regimes . in section",
    "iv we arrive at the phase diagram of the system and provide the minimum practical conditions for sustaining the topological phase in the laboratory .",
    "the number of mzms hosted by the topological superconductor and its possible symmetry classes are discussed in section v. finally , in section vi , we present two case studies - one with a periodically gated inas quantum wire and the other with an ultracold gas of optically trapped fermionic atoms - intended to assess the experimental viability of our scheme .",
    "our conclusions are given in section vii .",
    "in what follows we present and discuss the microscopic model that captures the physics of the system illustrated in fig . 1 :",
    "a quantum wire is gated by a periodic sequence of equally charged top gates and proximity coupled to an @xmath1-wave superconductor .",
    "the electrons in the wire are subject to e - e interactions and two types of spin - orbit interactions : the _ dresselhaus _ and _ rashba _ interactions . the rashba coupling , being sensitive to an external electric field , will pick up the same modulation of the field from the electrodes .",

    "this is not so , however , since kramers theorem forces these states to remain degenerate at the time - reversal invariant points @xmath54 and @xmath47 .",
    "so , while @xmath50 will cause some distortion of the subbands in fig .",
    "2(b ) , the bands remain connected at @xmath55 .",
    "the picture changes if time - reversal symmetry gets broken , either explicitly ( by adding e.g. a magnetic field ) or spontaneously , opening a bypass which avoids kramers theorem . in this context ,",
    "recall that strong to intermediate umklapp scattering in a hll ( which is here suppressed due to the assumed low electron density , being far from half - filling ) causes a spontaneous breaking of time - reversal symmetry , with a concurrent opening of a gap in the spectrum @xcite . as we shall demonstrate ,",
    "time reversal symmetry similarly gets spontaneously broken when a coulomb e - e repulsion @xmath56 is added to the hamiltonian @xmath5 .",
    "in fact , the combined modulated spin - orbit _ and _ e - e- interactions produce a spin - density wave for the electrons at the outer fermi points , leading to a spontaneous breaking of time - reversal invariance .",
    "the presence of the spin - density wave , while being a highly nontrivial phenomenon driven by the collective dynamics , is easy to establish within a bosonization formalism .",
    "we will turn to this matter in sec iii.b .    by triggering a spontaneous breaking of time - reversal symmetry in the wire , e - e interactions enable , in effect , the detachment of the bands at the boundaries of a reduced bz . specifically , in the next section we show that in the presence of e - e interactions , with the two outer fermi points residing close to the boundaries of one of the reduced bzs such that @xmath57 ( this will be the first reduced bz if @xmath49 , the second if @xmath58 , etc . ) , gaps open up at these boundaries , lifting the degeneracy of the corresponding states with spin projection @xmath53 . as a result , the interior of this reduced bz will support a hll at the two remaining gapless fermi points , with the @xmath53 spin content of these states locked to the direction of motion of the electrons .",

    "as a result , and as we shall derive formally , the amplitude of the combined process becomes quadratic in the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the modulation of the spin - orbit interaction is crucial for making the process _ selective _ , taking place only for electrons at _ one _ of the pairs of fermi points , specifically : the outer pair whose separation matches the wave number @xmath42 of the external modulation ( see fig .",

    "if @xmath83 is a ground state , then @xmath84 is also a ground state , differing from the first by the presence of an extra electron .",
    "as we shall see , in the present case there is always only a single unpaired mzm ( @xmath85 ) at each end of the wire .",
    "having outlined the backbone of our proposal , we close this section by stating the three basic conditions for it to work . first , the proximity gap must be smaller than the dynamically generated insulating gap at the zone boundaries , so that the states of the insulating and empty bands do not mix with the @xmath0-wave superconducting states .",
    "secondly , the smaller proximity gap must itself exceed the thermal energy so that the device is robust against thermal leakage .",
    "finally , the scaling lengths at which the gaps open up ( in the language of rg@xcite ) must fit within the system s cutoff length .",
    "the wire has to be sufficiently long also for suppressing the overlap between a left and right mzm wave function ( which would otherwise produce a spectral weight for a finite - energy electronic mode ) .",

    "supposing the same rate would be maintained in the next voltage injection , a two - fold boost in @xmath296 would be possible by raising the voltage to around 1.3 v. whereas this gives a first estimate , the actual relation between the rashba coupling energy and the voltage depends on various microscopic details of the material and setup and , hence , might not be a simple linear one . in any case",
    ", the tuning of the rashba coupling through the amplitude of the modulated electric field is a general feature of the system and can be exploited , possibly in association with other techniques .",
    "coming to the estimate @xmath264 , and recalling that @xmath297 , gives ( with the same values for @xmath20 and @xmath254 as above ) @xmath298 k. the estimated zero - field proximity gap in an insb - nbtin hybridized device @xcite is @xmath299 k , with this value being in the upper range of what has so far been reported from experiments .",
    "therefore , our lower bound is two orders of magnitude above the present experimental capability , calling for a material and engineering breakthrough if our scheme is to become viable .",
    "we conclude that a realization of the proposed setup using an inas quantum well is not feasible with present day technologies and within the regime of parameter values for which our formalism applies , especially in regard to the required strength of the proximity effect .",
    "nonetheless , it is worth noting that should the @xmath0-wave superconducting phase penetrate into the grey unknown region of fig .",

    ", a proximity - type pairing can be engineered via the coupling of the fermions to a bec bulk reservoir of feshbach molecules , as discussed in ref .. the coupling between the two systems is here transmitted by a pulsed rf field with a rabi frequency that sets the scale of the effective proximity pairing .    finally , considering ( iv )",
    ", we note that a theoretical proposal for emulating a _ position - dependent _ rashba - type interaction for atomic becs has very recently been put forward by su _",
    "the scheme relies on cyclically laser coupling internal atomic states in an environment where the detuning from resonance depends on the spatial position . in ref .",
