    "spin glasses @xcite have attracted much interest for quite a while . due to the considerable complexity of real materials",
    "much computational effort has gone into studies of a simplified model @xcite that is nevertheless thought to include the essential ingredients that lead to spin glass behaviour .",
    "since even this model is not trivial , a considerable industry has developed over time devoted to particular models that , although probably unphysical , have provided subjects for the development of numerical techniques @xcite .",
    "systems known as spin glasses are disordered magnetic systems characterised by a random mixture of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic exchange interactions leading to frustration @xcite .",
    "typically , at low temperatures below a critical temperature @xmath4 , a system undergoes a phase transition from a ferromagnet to a spin glass at some critical concentration @xmath5 of antiferromagnetic interactions .",
    "the model studied in this work is the bimodal , or @xmath6 , ising spin glass in two dimensions .",
    "this system has quenched bond ( short range , nearest neighbour ) interactions of fixed magnitude @xmath7 but random sign .",
    "the concentration @xmath8 of negative , or antiferromagnetic , bonds is varied from zero up the canonical spin glass at @xmath9 .",
    "it is believed that the spin glass can only exist at zero temperature @xcite where @xmath10 with @xcite @xmath11 .",
    "this is clearly below the concentration @xmath12 at the ( finite temperature ) nishimori point , indicating a reentrant phase transition as confirmed by monte carlo work @xcite .",
    "the ground state is highly degenerate with an entropy per spin @xcite of @xmath13 .",
    "consequently spin correlation functions are not guaranteed to take values @xmath14 .",
    "if a nearest - neighbour bond correlation function does have a value @xmath14 then we call that bond a rigid bond @xcite .",
    "this means that the spin alignment across the bond is the same in all ground state configurations .",
    "a recent study @xcite suggests that the rigid lattice does not percolate in the spin glass phase .",
    "this is consistent with the idea that the ferromagnetic phase is characterised by percolation of rigid bonds .",
    "droplet theory @xcite has enjoyed much success with regard to understanding the spin glass phase .",
    "the essential idea is that reversing all the spins in a compact cluster with respect to a ground state provides a low energy excitation .",
    "typical droplet excitations dominate the thermodynamic behaviour .",
    "a closely related idea is the domain wall defect @xcite ; essentially a droplet perimeter that extends to infinity . with a continuous distribution of disorder",
    "these related views seem to be equivalent @xcite according to the predictions of droplet theory .    for the bimodal model domain wall defects have , for example , been applied @xcite to the determination of the value of the critical defect concentration @xmath5 .",
    "nevertheless , it still remains unclear whether droplet theory is appropriate @xcite .",
    "the ground state is not unique and a droplet may represent some different ground state ; not an excitation .    for this study",
    "the @xmath15 square lattice is wound around a cylinder , that is we use periodic boundary conditions in one dimension . in the second dimension the system is nested in an infinite unfrustrated environment .",
    "there are no open boundaries .",
    "if the circumference @xmath2 of the cylinder is even then the energy gap is @xmath0 .",
    "otherwise it is @xmath1 . in the spin glass phase the distribution of degeneracies of the first excited state is extreme with a long tail representing large values @xcite .",
    "we have also looked at systems with open boundaries and have found extreme distributions of @xmath1 excitations in some agreement with wang @xcite .",
    "the issue of the size of the energy gap of the bimodal ising spin glass dates back to the proposal of wang and swendsen @xcite that it should be @xmath1 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "it now seems clear that in fact there is no energy gap at all and the low temperature specific heat varies as a power law @xmath16 .",
    "the first indications of this appeared in ref . and",
    "confirmation @xcite from the evaluation of very large pfaffians has recently appeared .",
    "the issue that remains unclear is the value of the critical exponent @xmath17 .",
    "for the case of continuous ( gaussian ) disorder , direct calculations @xcite report that the specific heat is linear with @xmath18 . for bimodal disorder monte carlo work @xcite",
    "reports that @xmath19 while droplet theory @xcite suggests that @xmath20 although the temperature range used is extremely narrow .",
    "other monte carlo results @xcite for the correlation length with the assumption of hyperscaling gives @xmath21 .",
    "universality is hard to prove .",
    "the exponent @xmath17 is difficult to estimate .",
    "one reason that makes this so for the bimodal case is that the specific heat is not normally distributed .",
    "we have performed some calculations with open boundaries and find that the distribution of the specific heat has a tail for low temperature and small values of linear sample size @xmath2 .",
    "the methods used were direct evaluation of pfaffians as well as summing the density of states @xcite .",
    "although it is reasonable to believe that the specific heat will be normally distributed in the thermodynamic limit , it is not clear what value to use from calculations with finite @xmath2 .",
    "it is at least clear now that the low - temperature specific heat contains contributions from excitations having a range of energies .",
    "this fits well with droplet theory @xcite where it is predicted that @xmath22 with the fractal dimension of domain walls given by @xmath23 .",
    "if @xmath24 as reported @xcite then @xmath20 .",
    "however , other work @xcite predicts values @xmath25 that imply @xmath26 .",
    "it seems unlikely that droplet theory can predict a value in agreement with @xmath19 or @xmath21 .    to obtain a simple description of the ferromagnetic phase we can start with the case of low defect concentration @xmath8",
    "the defect bonds are widely separated and the ground state is unique ( aside from global inversion ) .",
    "so the degeneracy of the ground state is @xmath27 .",
    "we can find first excited states by flipping a spin at either end of a defect bond .",
    "thus the degeneracy of the first excited state is @xmath28 where the square lattice has @xmath29 sites and @xmath30 bonds .",
    "the value of the density of states @xmath31 per spin is @xmath32 .",
    "we can think of clusters of disorder each composed of one negative bond and two frustrated plaquettes .    as the concentration @xmath33 increases",
    "the clusters of disorder grow in size and influence .",
    "the distribution of the density of states becomes less normal and its peak moves above @xmath32 .",
    "nevertheless , the rigid lattice still percolates and there remains some finite magnetisation . with a lattice of finite size , wound in one direction",
    ", the @xmath0 excitations occur in two classes .",
    "some are derived locally and are not influenced by the boundary condition ; just like the simple case of low concentration .",
    "others are formed by extending all the way around the system .",
    "since it is not easy to distinguish between these two classes , we employ the device of fixing an odd value of the circumference @xmath2 of the cylinder . in this case",
    "the @xmath1 excitations are entirely nonlocal .",
    "[ f : fig1 ] shows an example .",
    "the excitation depends on the boundary condition and would not exist otherwise .",
    "all @xmath1 excitations involve flipping all spins on one side of some closed path around the system .",
    "other closed paths can give excitations with energies equal to an odd multiple of @xmath1 .",
    "a @xmath0 excitation requires two paths .",
    "( color online ) an example of a @xmath1 excitation . on",
    "the left is a ground state configuration with six frustrated plaquettes and five unsatisfied ( jagged ) bonds . on the right",
    "is a first excited state obtained by flipping all spins on one side of the vertical broken line .",
    "the excited state has six unsatisfied bonds .",
    "periodic bcs are indicated by the top and bottom dashed vertical lines.,width=321 ]    our main message here is that it is possible to essentially define the ferromagnetic phase by the absence of these @xmath1 excitations .",
    "alternative approaches @xcite include the imposition of domain wall defects and the calculation of magnetisation .",
    "these nevertheless lack clear systematics due to the large degeneracy of the ground state .",
    "domain wall defects may not represent excitations at all since they can correspond to alternative ground states .",
    "sampling of domain walls can not be done in a controlled way and it is not obvious @xcite how we can obtain typical representative domain walls .",
    "calculation of the magnetisation is also problematic as a result of the ground state degeneracy . in ref .",
    ", for example , the algorithm starts with a ground state and proceeds with a monte carlo simulation to determine a typical value of the magnetisation .    in this work",
    "we propose a simple picture of the ferromagnetic phase that is evaluated from the response to temperature alone .",
    "the number of lowest energy excitations is counted exactly . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "these excitations can only exist in the spin glass phase .",
    "details of our results are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] after a brief account of our method .",
    "we use the pfaffian method and degenerate state perturbation theory to calculate the degeneracies of the excited states .",
    "the planar ising model can be mapped onto a system of noninteracting fermions .",
    "each bond is decorated with two fermions , one either side .",
    "a square plaquette then has four fermions inside and four others across the bonds , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . for a system with @xmath29 lattice sites",
    "we have @xmath34 fermions in total .",

    "the factor @xmath41 is precisely the pfaffian @xcite .",
    "this formalism is applicable to any distribution of disorder . for the bimodal model @xmath42 .    at zero temperature",
    "there are defect eigenstates of @xmath37 with eigenvalues equal to zero .",
    "each defect eigenstate can be expressed as a linear combination of the fermions localized in a frustrated plaquette .",
    "the number of these defect eigenstates is exactly equal to the number of frustrated plaquettes . at low temperature each defect eigenvalue approches zero as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is an integer and",
    "@xmath45 is a real number .",
    "these quantities @xmath44 and @xmath45 can be obtained using degenerate state perturbation theory @xcite .",

    "we have calculated @xmath31 for system sizes up to @xmath77 and concentrations @xmath8 ranging from 0.050 to 0.150 .",
    "the number of disorder realizations ranges from 20000 for the smallest size to 2000 for the largest .",

    "it is not necessary to work with some typical ground or excited state .",
    "distributions of the number of @xmath1 excitations are shown to differ in character between the phases . in the ferromagnetic phase the number declines as the ( odd ) circumference @xmath2 of the cylindrical winding increases .",
    "a finite - size scaling analysis produces a data collapse of excellent quality to support our conclusion that @xmath1 excitations do not exist in the thermodynamic limit of the ferromagnetic phase . in the spin glass phase",
    "the situation is reversed with the degeneracy of the first excited state increasing with @xmath2 .",
    "the energy gap in the ferromagnetic phase is @xmath0 . for even values of @xmath2 the first excitations have energy @xmath0 .",
    "we have also presented distributions of @xmath0 excitations so as to indicate that there is no essential dependence on whether @xmath2 is even or odd . in the ferromagnetic phase the peak grows taller and narrower with increasing @xmath2 and",
    "will presumably lead to a unique value of the low temperature specific heat in the thermodynamic limit .    in the spin glass phase the behaviour of the distributions is quite different .",
    "essentially they are extreme with long tails .",
    "as @xmath2 increases the tails become fatter and the peak collapses .",
    "we believe that this is consistent with a power law behaviour for the low temperature specific heat .",
    "the extreme distributions only indicate spin glass behaviour ; a proper statistical mechanical description of the model requires a summation over the entire density of states .",
    "this seems to suggest that thermally active droplets can indeed take many different values of energy .",
