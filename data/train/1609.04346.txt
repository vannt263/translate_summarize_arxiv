    "dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs ) associated with the milky way ( mw ) and andromeda galaxies provide important constraints on the role of dark matter in galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "indeed , these faint stellar systems are largely dominated by dark matter with mass - to - luminosity ratios of 10 to 1000 or even larger in fainter systems , based on their stellar dynamics @xcite .",
    "thus , the basic properties of dsphs , such as their total number and spatial distributions inside a host halo like the mw , provide useful constraints on dark matter on small scales , in particular the nature and evolution of cold dark matter ( cdm ) in a @xmath4 dominated universe .",
    "one of the tensions between theory and observation is the missing satellite problem : the theory predicts a much larger number of subhalos in a mw - like halo than the observed number of satellite galaxies @xcite .",
    "solutions to this problem are to consider other types of dark matter than cdm ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or to invoke baryonic physics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "another possibility is that we have seen only a fraction of all the satellites associated with the mw due to various observational biases @xcite .",
    "motivated by this , a systematic search for new dsphs has been made based on large survey programs , such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite and the dark energy survey ( des ) @xcite .",
    "sdss discovered 15 ultra - faint dwarf galaxies ( ufds ) with @xmath5 mag ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and des recently reported the discovery of many more candidate ufds in the south ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these discoveries are consistent with the work by @xcite , anticipating that there exists a large number of yet unidentified dwarf satellites in the mw halo , especially in its outer parts .",
    "this paper reports the discovery of a new faint dwarf satellite in the mw , in the course of the subaru strategic program ( ssp ) using hyper suprime - cam ( hsc ) .",
    "hsc is a new prime - focus camera on the subaru telescope with a 1.5  deg diameter field of view @xcite , which thus allows us to survey a large volume of the mw halo out to a large distance from the sun , where a systematic search for new satellites has not yet been undertaken .",
    "the hsc - ssp is an ongoing optical imaging survey , which consists of three layers with different combinations of area and depth .",
    "our search for new mw satellites is based on its wide layer , aiming to observe @xmath6 deg@xmath7 in five photometric bands ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 ) , where the target 5@xmath0 point - source limiting magnitudes are ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) = ( 26.5 , 26.1 , 25.9 , 25.1 , 24.4 ) mag . in this paper , we utilize the ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) data in the early hsc survey obtained before 2015 november , covering @xmath13 deg@xmath7 in 5 fields along the celestial equator . the hsc data are processed with hscpipe v4.0.1 , a branch of the large synoptic survey telescope pipeline @xcite calibrated against panstarrs1 photometry and astrometry @xcite .",
    "we use the _ extendedness _ parameter from the pipeline to select point sources .",
    "this parameter is computed from the ratio between psf and cmodel fluxes , which are measured by fitting psf models and two - component psf - convolved galaxy models to the source profile , respectively @xcite .",
    "when the ratio between these fluxes is larger than 0.985 , a source is classified as a point source .",
    "we use the parameter measured in the @xmath10-band , in which the seeing is typically the best of our five filters with a median of about @xmath14 .",
    "in particular , the @xmath10-band seeing for the region around our new - found satellite is about @xmath15 . in order to characterize the completeness and contamination of our star / galaxy classification",
    ", we stack the cosmos data ( cosmos is one of our ultradeep fields , where we have many exposures ) to the depth of the wide survey and compare our classification against the hst / acs data from @xcite .",
    "we find that the completeness , defined here as the fraction of objects that are classified as stars by acs , and correctly classified as stars by hsc , is above 90% at @xmath16 , and drops to @xmath17 at @xmath18 . on the other hand , contamination , which is defined as",
    "the fraction of hsc - classified stars which are classified as galaxies by acs , is close to zero at @xmath19 , but increases to @xmath20 at @xmath18 .",
    "based on this test , we choose to use the extendedness parameter down to @xmath18 to select stars in this work .",
    "we further apply a @xmath21 cut to eliminate numerous m - type disk stars .    in order to search for the signature of new satellites , we count stars in @xmath22 bins in right ascension and declination , with an overlap of @xmath23 in each direction , where @xmath24 corresponds to a typical half - light diameter ( @xmath25  pc ) of an ultra - faint dwarf at a distance of 90  kpc .",
    "we then calculate the mean density and its dispersion over all cells for each of the wide layer fields to search for any spatial overdensities of stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the deviation from the mean density has close to a gaussian distribution .",
    "we have found one stellar overdensity with 5.5@xmath0 in one of the wide layer fields .",
    "the standard deviation is estimated separately for each survey field ( covering typically 20 to 30  deg@xmath7 ) ; each field is at different galactic coordinates .",
    "this overdensity is centered at @xmath26 . as figure",
    "[ fig : space ] shows , there is no corresponding overdensity in extended objects ( galaxies ) ) of the sources with @xmath27 has been identified in the survey region , but this appears an artefact related to scattered light from a nearby bright star . ] .    in figure",
    "[ fig : space_cmd](a ) , we plot the spatial distribution of the stars around this overdensity , which shows a localized concentration of stars within a circle of radius @xmath28 . to get further insights into this overdensity , in figure [ fig : space_cmd](c ) , we plot the @xmath29 color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of stars within the @xmath28 radius circle shown in figure [ fig : space_cmd](a ) .",
    "this cmd shows signatures of main sequence ( ms ) stars near its turn off ( msto ) as well as stars on the red giant branch ( rgb ) , whereas these features disappear when we plot stars at @xmath30 with the same solid angle , i.e. likely field stars outside the overdensity , as shown in figure [ fig : space_cmd](e ) . to investigate the distribution of the overdensity in the cmd further",
    ", we adopt a fiducial locus of stars in a typical ultra - faint dwarf galaxy based on a parsec isochrone @xcite , in which we assume an age of 13  gyr and metallicity of @xmath31 ( [ m@xmath32h]@xmath33 ) .",
    "we first derive this isochrone in the sdss filter system and then convert to the hsc filter system using the following formula calibrated from both filter curves and spectral atlas of stars @xcite , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and the subscript sdss denotes the sdss system .",
    "this isochrone , at the assumed distance modulus of @xmath37 mag as determined below , is shown in figure [ fig : space_cmd](d ) , which does a good job of tracing the distributions of msto and rgb stars . to test the statistical significance of the overdensity along this isochrone , we set the selection filter defined by the cmd envelope [ shaded region in figure [ fig : space_cmd](d ) ] , which consists of the above isochrone , 1@xmath0 @xmath38 color measurement error as a function of @xmath9-band magnitude , and a typical color dispersion of about @xmath39 mag at the location of the rgb arising from a metallicity dispersion of @xmath40 dex for dsph stars . by passing this filter over the stars in the relevant region ,",
    "we derive an overdensity that peaks at a distance modulus of 19.7  mag at a statistical significance of 10.8@xmath0 , much higher than without the filter .",
    "figure [ fig : space_cmd](b ) shows the distribution of the stars that pass this filter , revealing a higher overdensity contrast than figure [ fig : space_cmd](a ) .",
    "this suggests that the overdensity we have found here is indeed an old stellar system , either a globular cluster or dwarf galaxy .",
    "hereafter we refer to this system as virgo  i to 20 kpc and covering a much larger volume @xcite . ] .",
    "the stars selected by this isochrone filter lie along a clear stellar sequence even in a 2-color ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) diagram .",
    "we note that the statistical significance of this overdensity before ( after ) passing this isochrone filter remains basically unchanged when we adopt different magnitude limits for the sample : 5.6@xmath0 ( 10.3@xmath0 ) for @xmath43  mag and 4.8@xmath0 ( 9.6@xmath0 ) for @xmath44  mag .",
    "we estimate the basic structural properties of virgo  i. for this purpose , we adopt six parameters @xmath45 : @xmath46 for the celestial coordinates of the centroid of the overdensity , @xmath47 for its position angle from north to east , @xmath48 for the ellipticity , @xmath49 for the half - light radius , and @xmath50 for the number of stars belonging to the overdensity .",
    "the maximum likelihood method of @xcite is applied to the stars within a circle of radius @xmath51 passing the isochrone filter ; the results are summarized in table  [ tab : 1 ] .",

    "the overplotted line corresponds to the best - fit exponential profile with a half - light radius of @xmath69 or 38  pc .",
    "this spatial size is larger than the typical size of mw globular clusters but is consistent with the scale of dwarf satellites as examined below .",
    "the total absolute magnitude of virgo  i , @xmath70 , is estimated by summing the luminosities of the stars within the half - light radius , @xmath49 , and then doubling the summed luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . for the transformation from @xmath71 to @xmath72",
    ", we adopt the formula in @xcite calibrated for metal - poor population ii , which are appropriate for stars in ultra - faint dwarf galaxies .",
    "assuming that the distance to this stellar system is 87  kpc or @xmath37  mag , we obtain @xmath73 mag for @xmath69 .",
    "this value varies when we adopt different half - light radii or different distance moduli within their 1@xmath0 uncertainties .",
    "we find @xmath74 mag if we adopt @xmath75 and @xmath76 mag and @xmath77 mag for @xmath78 and and @xmath79 mag .",
    "the latter case yields a much brighter @xmath70 due to the inclusion of a bright rgb star inside the aperture .",
    "shot noise due to the small number of stars in virgo  i is a significant additional source of uncertainty in @xmath70 .",
    "we quantify this and other sources of error using a monte carlo method similar to that described in @xcite to determine the most likely value of @xmath70 and its uncertainty . as summarized in table  [",

    "to assess if virgo  i identified here is indeed a new mw dwarf satellite galaxy , we compare its size quantified by @xmath49 with globular clusters with comparable luminosity , in the range of @xmath88 to @xmath89 mag . in figure",

    "the red star with error bars shows virgo  i detected in this work .    as is clear from the figure , the current stellar system is systematically larger than mw globular clusters with comparable @xmath70 and is located along the locus of the mw and m31 dwarf galaxies .",
    "this is the case even if we adopt the brighter estimate of @xmath90 mag by considering the 1@xmath0 uncertainty in @xmath70 .",
    "thus , the overdensity of the stars we have found here is a candidate ultra - faint dwarf galaxy .",

    "the half - light radius of virgo  i is estimated to be @xmath94 pc , significantly larger than globular clusters with the same luminosity , suggesting that it is a dwarf galaxy . to set further constraints on virgo  i , follow - up spectroscopic studies of bright rgb stars will be useful to investigate their membership and to determine the chemical and dynamical properties in this dwarf satellite .",
    "virgo  i is located beyond the reach of the sdss : its limiting magnitude of @xmath95 implies that the completeness radius beyond which a faint dwarf galaxy like virgo  i will not be detected @xcite is 28  kpc . with subaru / hsc , this completeness radius for virgo",
