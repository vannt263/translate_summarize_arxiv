    "the manipulation and coherent control of electronic spin degree of freedom has emerged as an important area of research in recent years .",
    "it in turn requires the ability to generate , inject and control spin polarized charge current - an example of that is datta - das spin - transistor @xcite , where a semiconductor is sandwiched between two ferromagnetic contacts . the injection and detection of spin polarized current",
    "is achieved by using ferromagnetic contacts in which spin is easier to manipulate because it behaves as a collective degree of freedom . in the semiconductor region ,",
    "coherent control of spin polarized current is done using the band structure spin - orbit(so ) coupling , known as rashba so interaction which arises due to structural inversion asymmetry@xcite .    in recent years",
    "it has been realized that so coupling can be used to efficiently generate and detect spin - polarized current in semiconductor heterostructure without the ferromagnetic contacts@xcite . in finite size sample with so coupling when an unpolarized charge currents passes it generates spin currents(via so scattering ) in transverse direction which in turn leads to spin accumulation at the lateral edges of the sample and",
    "is known as spin -hall effect(she)@xcite .",
    "the spin accumulation due to she has been observed experimentally@xcite . in such systems",
    "the spin accumulation and its relation to bulk spin current is a complex issue .",
    "this is because in finite size sample , the lateral edges of the sample acts like an impenetrable barrier for particles which carries spin .",
    "therefore the boundary spin accumulation in such systems is affected by the elastic scattering of spin polarized carriers from the sample boundary in presence of so coupling .",
    "more precisely , spin - dependent elastic reflection from an impenetrable barrier in the presence of soc depends on the spin - orientation of particles which in - turn affects the spin accumulation .",
    "hence spin accumulation at sample boundary not only depends on the bulk spin current but also on the spin - dependent scattering from the lateral impenetrable barrier .",
    "for system with only rashba so coupling , spin - dependent elastic reflection of 2deg from an impenetrable barrier in the presence of rashba soc was studied in ref.@xcite , where it was shown to generate spin polarized reflected beam .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling owes its origin to appearance of inversion symmetry breaking electrical fields whether they arise intrinsically in the band structure(lack of inversion center ) or by an external confining potential . in the former case inversion symmetry",
    "is broken locally and resulting so interaction is known as dresselhaus spin - orbit coupling@xcite , while in the later case confining potential leads to structure inversion asymmetry which breaks inversion symmetry globally and leads to appearance of rashba spin - orbit coupling@xcite .",
    "beside these two , another type of soc arises due to presence of heavy impurity known as impurity induced soc . in low - dimensional nano - system",
    "all these different type of so couplings may be present simultaneously and compete with each other . among all",
    "these rashba soc is more important because of its tunability via external gate voltage @xcite , while dresselhaus and impurity induced soc are fixed and determined by the material properties like crystal structure and impurity type and it s concentration .",
    "rashba and dresselhaus soc are also known as _",
    "intrinsic _ soc because of their origin in the band structure while impurity induced soc is known as _",
    "extrinsic _ soc .",
    "although both rashba and dresselhaus soc are linear in momentum , however , there is an important difference , the rashba coupling is isotropic while dresselhaus coupling is anisotropic , i.e. depends on the orientation of crystal .",
    "this is so because the rashba coupling is determined by globally inversion asymmetry and is independent of crystal structure while dresselhaus crucially depends on the crystal structure as it originates due to local inversion asymmetry@xcite .",
    "the simultaneous presence of both rashba and dresselhaus couplings together with the tunability of rashba soc allows greater control over spin polarized transport @xcite which in turn gives rise to many interesting and novel phenomena such as , ballistic spin field effect transistor@xcite , persistent spin helix and spin edge helices@xcite etc .    in view of this , we present a detailed study of spin dependent scattering in confined geometry in presence of both rashba an dresselhaus so coupling .",
    "the anisotropic nature of dresselhaus so coupling leads to an anisotropic fermi energy .",
    "this anisotropy in conjugation with the tunability of rashba coupling affects the spin dependent double refraction as well spin accumulation in a non - trivial way as we will see later .",
    "it is also shown that even if we take unpolarized incoming beam , the net polarization is coming out to be non - zero . in the over critical region all the three component of spin polarization",
    "are present and are exponentially decaying as distance from the barrier increases .",
    "the model hamiltonian including both rashba and dresselhaus coupling has the form , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the 2d in - plane wave vector and @xmath3 is effective mass . the second and third term in eq.(1 )",

    "therefore simultaneous presence of both rashba and dresselhaus spin orbit coupling provides a much better control over the spin splitting and we will see later that this leads to interesting phenomena for spin dependent elastic reflection from impenetrable barriers .",

    "this is consistent with the anisotropic fermi contours in fig(1 ) ( panel(c ) and ( panel(d ) ) . for @xmath18 at @xmath79 all four reflection coefficients become equal since at this point the two fermi contours cross each other .",
    "this is again reflected in the splitting angle which is poltted in fig.(4 ) , again the splitting vanishes for @xmath18 at @xmath0 and for all other cases it never vanishes . we stress that this vanishing of splitting angle or crossing of fermi contours happens only if both rashba and dresselhaus couplings are present and of equal strength .",
    "if only rashba or only dresselhaus coupling is present this is not so .",
    "in fact this is related to the fact that simultaneous presence of rashba and dresselhaus coupling of equal strength introduces anisotropy ( in _ k _ ) in the spin - splitting even in the linear term .",
    "@xcite this implies that at a particular angle of incident the reflection from impenetrable barrier would not produce spin polarization only for @xmath18 case and in this typical case only the boundary spin accumulation will be fully determined by the bulk spin currents .",

    "this non - propagating non - zero polarization gives rise to spin - accumulation near the barrier which is clearly an important consequence of spin - dependent elastic reflection from a impenetrable barrier in the presence of rashba and dresselhaus soc .",
    "so it is clear that spin - accumulation near the barrier is a typical phenomena in which spin - accumulation near the barrier will not only depend upon the bulk spin - current but also on the spin - dependent scattering from the lateral impenetrable barrier which can be think of the lateral edges of the sample .",

    "in addition , present work shows that the spin - orientation of the electrons changes because of the spin - dependent reflection from an impenetrable barrier in the presence rashba and dresselhaus soc .",
    "it gives rise to a new mechanism of multiple reflection analogous to the birefringence phenomena .",
    "also an important feature of anisotropy in the fermi energy surface come into appearance because of this reflection .",

    "a non - zero spin - polarized current is observed for all incident angle between 0 to @xmath66 except at angle of @xmath0 which is clearly an another important feature of rashba and dresselhaus soc interplay .",
    "also it is shown that in the over - critical region , there is some spin - accumulation at the edges which get modified because of elastic scattering at the lateral edges . in this simple picture scattering off the edge",
    "is not considered , however , in the present studies we have shown that at the edges the net polarization of the scattered beams has oscillatory nature and always has a non - zero polarization .",
    "it is also shown that all the three components of spin polarization will be present in the over - critical region . 0.5",
