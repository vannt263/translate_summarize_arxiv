    "the optical color - magnitude relation of galaxies shows a clear bimodality , with a narrow sequence of red ( predominantly spheroidal ) galaxies and a `` blue cloud '' of actively star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "studies of the evolution of the red galaxy luminosity function suggest that the stellar mass within the red sequence has increased since @xmath7 , perhaps by a factor of @xmath8 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the most likely cause of this growth is the transition of blue cloud galaxies to red sequence galaxies at @xmath9 .",
    "recent semi - analytic models of galaxy formation support such a scenario ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in order to reproduce the color bimodality ,",
    "one or more mechanisms must be introduced to shut down the star - formation ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and turn blue galaxies red .",
    "some authors suggest that feedback from merger - induced agn activity could be the quenching mechanism ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) , while others suggest that supernovae in a starburst galaxy may have the required energy to blow out enough gas @xcite .",
    "other possible mechanisms include virial shock heating of the galaxy halo @xcite or simple gas consumption .",
    "if we are to understand how galaxies shut off their star - formation and become red , it is clearly important to identify and study the population of sources that have recently moved onto the red sequence or are in a transition region between the red sequence and blue cloud commonly referred to as the `` green valley '' .",
    "these sources may still show signs of agn and/or residual star - formation as they move onto the red sequence .",
    "optical studies of the stellar populations of red galaxies generally show them to be dominated by an old component ( e.g. , @xcite ) , with perhaps a `` frosting '' of stars formed since @xmath10=1 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in studies of local ellipticals",
    ", the weak infrared emission is usually attributed to mass loss from the evolved stellar population ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . however , there has been recent evidence from @xmath11 and @xmath4 that both hidden agn and star - formation activity may occur in red galaxies out to @xmath12 ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "more than half of all red galaxies have narrow emission lines in their optical spectra indicative of agn activity ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "the red galaxies are likely to have bluer [ 5.8]-[8.0 ] colors because of the weakness or lack of pah emission features and/or the 1.6@xmath1 stellar photospheric feature ( the `` stellar bump '' ) that may still dominate the infrared emission in less active sources with large old stellar populations .",

    "the mean uv to 24@xmath1 flux density ratio of the 24@xmath1 excess red galaxies is a factor of 10(4 ) smaller than that of the irregular galaxy ( agn ) template and twice as high as that of the sbc spiral galaxy template .",
    "this suggests that they contain a larger amount of dust and/or host an older stellar population than typical irregular galaxies .",
    "if the 24 @xmath1 and uv excesses are due largely to agn , then the uv emission must be suppressed by dust .",

    "the fraction of 24@xmath1 excess red galaxies with a spiral morphology is much larger than the 11% of 24@xmath1 faint red galaxies with such morphologies and suggests that some fraction of the 24@xmath1 excess red galaxies are reddened edge - on disk galaxies . of the 24@xmath1 excess red galaxies within the pah region of the infrared color - color diagram , 50% have spiral morphologies ( compared to 32% of the `` non - pah '' sources ) .",

    "these results are more consistent with the 24@xmath1 excess population being dominated by merging red galaxies rather than quenched galaxies that have recently joined the red sequence . in the latter case , the `` downsizing '' of galaxies ( in which galaxies of decreasing mass are progressively joining the red sequence with time ) would imply that the masses of 24@xmath1 excess red galaxies should be less than that of 24@xmath1 faint red galaxies ( that joined the red sequence at a higher redshift ) . on the other hand , we show in section  [ sec : morph ] that the 24@xmath1 excess galaxies show no evidence for a larger fraction of sources with either a disturbed morphology or close companion than that of the 24@xmath1 faint red galaxies .",

    "roughly 40% are likely to be edge - on disk galaxies with high extinction .",
    "the rest are likely to be red galaxies whose 24@xmath1 emission comes from both obscured agn and star formation activity . they may be a transition population of sources that have only recently left the blue cloud to join the red sequence and in which the residual star - formation is being quenched by agn activity that becomes increasingly dominant in the optical band as the sources become redder . alternatively , they could be massive red galaxies undergoing a burst of obscured star - formation activity ( perhaps due to a merger ) .",
    "further work needs to be done to determine which of these mechanisms dominates and how this changes with redshift .",
    "by analyzing the infrared colors and optical line diagnostics of 0.15@xmath690.3 24@xmath1 excess red galaxies and comparing these to that of blue , green valley , and 24@xmath1 faint red galaxies within the ages survey , we find the following :    * of the total red galaxy population , 10% have 24 @xmath70 flux densities , f@xmath130.3 mjy .",
    "these correspond to infrared luminosities that are larger than we would expect from the infrared emission of local elliptical galaxies . * using their [ 5.8]-[8.0 ] irac colors , we show that 64% of the 24@xmath1 excess red galaxies are likely to have strong pah emission features in their infrared spectra ( compared to only 5% of the 24@xmath1 faint red galaxies ) .",
    "this result suggests that in a large fraction of the sources , the infrared emission is dominated by star - formation processes . * a much larger fraction of 24@xmath1 excess red galaxies are classified as star - forming using infrared diagnostics ( @xmath264% ) than optical line diagnostics ( @xmath215% ) .",
    "this result suggests that in many sources , both agn and star - formation activity are occurring simultaneously ( but that in the optical , the agn dominates the signal whereas in the infrared , the pah emission features dominate . ) * although the optical to near - ir seds of the 24@xmath1 excess and 24@xmath1 quiet galaxies are very similar , the 24@xmath1 excess red galaxies appear to also have a small uv excess over that of the 24@xmath1 quiet galaxies .",
    "the small uv to 24@xmath1 ratio suggests a large amount of dust and/or relatively old stellar population compared to that of irregular galaxies . *",
    "approximately 40% of 24@xmath1 excess red galaxies at low redshifts are likely to be dusty edge - on spiral galaxies , whose high optical extinctions make them red .",
    "the rest are likely to be red galaxies whose 24@xmath1 emission comes from both obscured agn and star formation activity .",
    "this may be triggered by minor mergers of red galaxies or , in some cases , may be the residual activity as blue galaxies are quenched to form red sequence galaxies .",
