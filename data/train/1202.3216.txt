    "be stars are b - type stars with luminosity class iii to v that show or have shown emission in balmer lines like h@xmath5 , which originate in a circumstellar disc .",
    "they occupy a region on or near the main sequence in the hr diagram , implying that they are still burning hydrogen in their core .",
    "these stars are rapid rotators and show both photometric and spectroscopic variability .",
    "detailed studies of be stars in environments with different metallicities , such as the magellanic clouds , have been performed in the recent past @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented a catalogue of 1056 be star candidates in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) by studying light curve variations using ogle ii data base @xcite .",
    "they classified these be star candidates of the smc in four categories : type 1 stars showing outbursts ( 139 stars ) ; type 2 stars showing sudden luminosity jumps ( 154 stars ) ; type 3 stars showing periodic or near periodic variations ( 78 stars ) ; type 4 stars showing light curves similar to galactic be stars ( 658 stars ) .",
    "they also classified type 1 stars with luminosity jumps in their light curves as type1/type2 stars ( 18 stars ) .",
    "they suggested that type 4 could be be stars .",
    "they also proposed that some of the type 1 and type 2 stars might be be stars with accreting white dwarfs in a be + wd binary , or they could be blue pre - main sequence stars showing accretion disc thermal instabilities .",
    "spectroscopy is needed to confirm the suggestion that some of these stars are be stars .",
    "also , more studies , especially in the near - infrared ( nir ) are required to confirm the pre - main sequence hypothesis . on the other hand",
    ", they suggested that type 3 stars should not be linked to the be star phenomenon at all .",
    "based on a similar inspection of ogle ii data , @xcite classified be candidates in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) also as type 1 ( 581 stars ) , type 2 ( 150 stars ) , type 3 ( 149 stars ) , type 4 stars ( 1468 stars ) and type 1/type 2 stars ( 98 stars ) .",
    "however many of the type 4 stars in the lmc are found to be reddened and located parallel to the main sequence , this feature was not found in the same diagrams of the smc .",
    "the photometric properties of type 1 and type 3 stars on the lmc are very different from those of the smc .",
    "thus , the various types of stars identified based on variability seem to differ between the lmc and the smc .",
    "the above studies identified a large number of candidate be stars which can be used to derive the parameters that are responsible for the be - phenomenon as these types of stars in the mcs are metal poor when compared to the galactic be stars .",
    "the above classification was based only on photometric variability .",
    "it is desirable to get some more properties like their nir magnitudes and colours to understand these stars .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the nir properties of various types of be star candidates in the l&smc by cross - matching irsf ( nir ) and ogle ii ( optical ) catalogs .",
    "we also present results from a spectroscopic study of 70 stars from types 1 , 2 and 3 in the smc and 49 stars belonging to type 1 and type 3 in the lmc .",
    "the spectral features are used to identify their spectral class and to see whether they show some properties of be stars .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows .",
    "details of the nir photometric data as well as the spectroscopic data are presented in section 2 .",
    "the results of the cross - correlation between the optical and nir properties as well the spectral classification are presented in sections 3 and 4 .",
    "the results are presented in section 5 .",
    "discussion and conclusion are presented in sections 6 and 7 respectively .",
    "catalogs of be star candidates in the smc and the lmc as identified by @xcite ( @xmath0 1000 stars ) and @xcite ( 2446 stars ) respectively were used . in order to obtain their nir properties",
    ", we used the nir irsf catalog ( @xcite ; http://pasj.asj.or.jp/v59/n3/590315 ) which has @xmath9 photometric data for about 15 million point sources spread over a 40 deg@xmath10 area of the lmc and 2.7 million sources spread over a 11 deg@xmath10 area of the smc .",
    "the 10@xmath11 limiting magnitudes of the above catalog are 18.8 , 17.8 and 16.6 mag at @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively .",
    "this catalog has better spatial resolution than the 2mass catalog .",
    "the optically identified stars were cross - matched with nir irsf catalog to confirm its candidature in irsf .",
    "matches between both catalogs were found by comparing the ra and dec co - ordinates in both the catalogs .",
    "we considered the closest candidates as nir counterpart , with an upper limit of 0.001 degree ( 3.6 arcsec ) for separation .",
    "we could cross - identify the nir counterpart of 1640 stars among the 2348 candidate be stars in the lmc ( excluding the type 1/2 candidates ) and 839 stars from the sample of 1029 stars in the smc .",
    "hence the cross identification is 70% successful in the lmc and 80% in the smc . due to crowding",
    "we could not cross - identify rest of the stars .",
    "these stars were used to study the nir properties of the various types .",
    "optical spectra were obtained for 120 candidate stars in the lmc and the smc .",
    "spectroscopic observations were conducted at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) and the las campanas observatory ( lco ) during 4 nights of october 2002 and 4 nights of november 2003 , respectively . at the ctio we used the 1.5-m telescope with the cassegrain spectrograph and the loral 1-k detector .",
    "this spectrograph details are available in the web page : http://www.ctio.noao.edu/spectrographs/60spec/60spec.html .",
    "we obtained 57 blue spectra with the grating @xmath12 .",
    "26 tilted at 16.2 degree and a slit width of 1.5 arcseconds , yielding a wavelength range of 3700@xmath85500  .",
    "52 red spectra were obtained with grating @xmath12 .",
    "36 tilted 28.7 deg , resulting in a wavelength range of 5700@xmath87000  . in both cases the resolution was about 3.7  .",
    "the spectra were reduced with standard iraf routines , like apall and doslit , including bad pixel rejection , spectroscopic flat fielding , 1d extraction and wavelength calibration .",
    "the typical error in the wavelength calibration is 5 km / s in h@xmath7 .",
    "in addition , 48 spectra were obtained in lco with the modular spectrograph and the site2 detector .",
    "technical details for this spectrograph can be found in the web page of the lco observatory .",
    "the combination of grating @xmath12 .",
    "600 blazed at 5000  , with a slit width of 1.5 arcseconds yielded a spectral range of 3870@xmath86100  , and a resolution of 2.5  .",
    "the log of observations are given in tables 1 and 2 ( see appendix ) .",
    "the spectra were reduced and wavelength calibrated using the standard iraf tasks .",
    "the typical error in the wavelength calibration is 12 km / s in h@xmath13 .",
    "these spectra were used to identify the spectral lines , determine spectral types and measure equivalent width .",
    "we cross - correlated 1640 stars ( 70% ) identified by @xcite with the irsf data in the lmc . among these , 399 are type 1 stars , 92 are type 2 stars , 91 are type 3 stars and 989 stars are type 4 stars .",
    "the smc sample contains 839 stars , of which 89 are type 1 stars , 131 are type 2 stars , 65 are type 3 stars and 554 are type 4 stars .    adopting an average value of @xmath4 = 0.1 and @xmath14 , on the basis of previously published values , colour magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) with @xmath15 vs @xmath16",
    "were plotted .",
    "figure 1 and figure 2 show @xmath16 versus @xmath15 cmds for the cross matched stars ( type 1 to type 4 shown in different colours ) for the lmc and the smc respectively .",
    "these figures show the location of all the types in the cmd , which indicates that the cross - identified stars span the full range of locii similar to the optically identified sample ( in comparison with the figures given in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "we notice the red sequence of type 4 stars located parallel to the main sequence in the range of @xmath17 = 0.4 to 0.7 mag , in figure 1 ( lmc ) , which is absent in figure 2 ( smc ) .",
    "this feature was noticed by @xcite .",
    "this shows that the cross - correlated sample contains these peculiar stars also .",
    "in order to quantify and thus verify whether we have evenly sampled all the types in both the galaxies , we estimated the fractions of various types ."
