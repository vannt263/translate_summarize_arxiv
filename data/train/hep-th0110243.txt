    "there are several reasons for studying gauge theories of the symmetric group @xmath0 in the large @xmath1 limit .",
    "the first one is of course that the problem is interesting in itself , as a simple but non trivial theory with non abelian gauge invariance .",
    "a second reason of interest is that gauge theories of @xmath0 on a riemann surface describe the statistics of the @xmath1-coverings of the surface , namely they address and solve the problem of counting in how many distinct ways the surface can be covered @xmath1 times , without allowing folds but allowing branch points ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the distinct coverings of a two - dimensional surface are on the other hand the string configurations of a two - dimensional string theory , so that @xmath0 gauge theories count the number of string configurations where the world sheet wraps @xmath1 times around the target space .",
    "another reason of interest is that gauge theories of @xmath0 are closely related to yang - mills theory in two dimensions , and to other gauge models , like the one introduced by kostov , staudacher and wynter ( in brief ksw ) in  @xcite . both ym2",
    "@xcite and the ksw model with @xmath7 gauge group can in fact be interpreted in the large @xmath2 limit in terms of coverings of the two dimensional target space .    in the present paper",
    "we consider the gauge theory of the symmetric group @xmath0 in its own right , in the limit where @xmath1 , namely the world sheet area , becomes large .",
    "the relation of this limit with the large @xmath2 limit of @xmath7 gauge theories will be discussed in section 5 .",
    "three main results have been obtained in this paper .",
    "the first is the discovery of a non trivial phase structure in the large-@xmath1 limit of the @xmath0 gauge theory on a sphere , with a phase transition at a critical value of the `` area '' of the target surface . at first sight",
    "this is reminiscent of the douglas - kazakov  @xcite phase transition for two dimensional yang - mills theories , but it turns out to be a different phenomenon , as shown in section 5 .",
    "the second result consists in the proof of the equivalence between gauge theories in two dimensions and random walks on group manifolds , which , in the case of @xmath0 , allows us to map our results , in particular the aforementioned phase transition , into statements about random walks on @xmath0 .",
    "the phase transition found in the @xmath0 gauge theory precisely corresponds to the cutoff phenomenon in random walks on @xmath0 discovered in  @xcite .",
    "finally we found that the same cutoff phenomenon occurs also in 2d yang - mills theory with a rescaling of the coupling constant with @xmath2 that differ from the standard t hooft rescaling by a factor @xmath3 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "2 we review the correspondence between @xmath0 gauge theories and branched coverings , defining the models we are going to study . in sec .",
    "3 we study the partition function on the sphere by a saddle point analysis of the sum over the irreducible representations of @xmath0 .",
    "this allows us to identify two lines of large-@xmath1 phase transitions in the phase diagram of the model . in sec .",
    "4 we show the equivalence between two - dimensional gauge theories and random walks on group manifolds .",
    "this equivalence allows us to reinterpret the phase transition as a cutoff phenomenon in the corresponding random walk .",
    "the approach through the equivalent random walk is particularly suited to study the partition function on a disk with free boundary conditions , where we find a similar , if less rich , phase diagram .",
    "a mapping into the theory of random graphs allows us to determine that the order parameter in the case of the disk is the connectivity of the world sheet , and to draw some conclusions also on the connectivity of the world sheet in the case of the sphere . in sec .",
    "5 we establish the relation between @xmath0 gauge theory in the large @xmath1 limit and @xmath7 gauge theories ( yang - mills theory , chiral yang - mills theory and ksw model ) in the large @xmath2 limit and we prove the existence of a cutoff phenomenon also for 2d yang - mills .",
    "section 6 is devoted to some concluding remarks and possible developments .",
    "some technical details are discussed in the appendices .",
    "the statistics of the @xmath1-coverings of a riemann surface @xmath8 of genus @xmath9 is given by the partition function of a @xmath0 lattice gauge theory , defined on a cell decomposition of @xmath8 .",
    "this can be seen by the following argument ( more details can be found in ref.@xcite ) . to construct a branched @xmath1-covering ,",
    "consider @xmath1 copies of each site of the cell decomposition : these will be the sites of the covering surface .",
    "for each link of the target surface , joining the sites @xmath10 and @xmath11 , join each of the @xmath1 copies of @xmath10 to one of the @xmath1 copies of @xmath11 ; repeat for all the links of the target surface to define a discretized covering . each possible covering",
    "is defined by a choice of the copies to be glued for each link of the target surface , that is by assigning an element of the symmetric group @xmath0 to each link .",
    "in general , such a covering will have branch points : consider a closed path on the target surface , and lift it to the covering surface , by starting on one of the @xmath1 sheets of the covering and changing sheet according to the element of @xmath0 associated to the links defining the path .",
    "the lifted path is not in general closed , that is the covering is branched .",
    "branch points are located on the plaquettes of the cell decomposition , and can be classified according to the conjugacy class of the element of @xmath0 given by the ordered product of the elements associated to the links of the plaquette .",
    "for example , let @xmath12 and consider a plaquette bordered by three links , to which the following permutations are associated @xmath13 then the permutation associated to the plaquette is @xmath14 so that a quadratic branch point is associated to the plaquette .",
    "the type of branch point on each plaquette is determined by the conjugacy class of the product of the @xmath0 elements around the plaquette , and is therefore invariant under a local @xmath0 gauge transformation defined according to the usual rules of lattice gauge theory .",
    "therefore _ a theory of @xmath1-coverings , in which the boltzmann weight depends only on the type of branch points that are present on each plaquette , is a lattice gauge theory defined on the target surface , with gauge group @xmath0 . _",
    "the phase structure of such theories in the large @xmath1 limit is the object of our study .",
    "let us consider first the case of unbranched coverings .",
    "the boltzmann weight associated to the plaquette @xmath15 is simply @xmath16 : the product of gauge variables around the plaquette is constrained to be the identity is one if @xmath17 is the identity in @xmath0 and zero otherwise]of @xmath0 : w(p_s ) = ( p_s ) = _ r d_r _ r(p_s ) [ delta1 ] in the l.h.s . of ( [ delta1 ] )",
    "the delta function is expressed as an expansion in the characters of @xmath0 , with @xmath18 labeling the representations of @xmath0 , @xmath19 the dimension of the representation @xmath18 and @xmath20 the character of @xmath17 in the representation @xmath18 .",
    "the partition function of this model on @xmath8 is simply given by  @xcite : z_n , g=_r ( ) ^2 - 2 g [ nobranch ] the partition function ( [ nobranch ] ) depends only on the genus @xmath9 of the surface , namely the underlying theory is a topological theory .",
    "when branch points are allowed , the topological character of the theory is lost , and the partition function develops a dependence on another parameter , which we shall call `` area '' and denote by @xmath21 , but which is not necessarily identified with the area of @xmath8 .",
    "all we require is that @xmath22 is additive , namely that if we sew two surfaces ( for instance two plaquettes ) the total `` area '' is the sum of the `` areas '' of the constituents .",
    "in fact , by mimicking ( generalized ) yang - mills theories , one can replace  @xcite the boltzmann weight ( [ delta1 ] ) of the topological theory with a boltzmann weight that allows branch points : w(p_s,_s ) = _ r d_r _ r(p_s ) e^_s g_r [ plaquette ] where @xmath23 are arbitrary coefficients and @xmath24 is the area of the plaquette @xmath15 .",
    "the crucial property of this boltzmann weight is that , if @xmath25 and @xmath26 are two adjoining plaquettes and @xmath27 the permutation associated with their common link , we have : _ q w(q p_1,_s_1 ) w ( p_2 q^-1,_s_2 ) = w(p_1 p_2,_s_1 + _ s_2 ) [ cruc ] that is by summing over @xmath27 we obtain the same boltzmann weight that we would have if the link corresponding to the variable @xmath27 had been suppressed in the original lattice .",
    "the partition function on a riemann surface of genus @xmath9 can be easily calculated from ( [ plaquette ] ) by using the orthogonality properties of the characters : z_n , g(a ) = _ r ( ) ^2 - 2 g",
    "e^a g_r [ zetag ] as discussed in  @xcite the exponential factor in the partition function ( [ zetag ] ) can be thought of as due to a dense distribution of branch points , in which a branch point associated to a permutation @xmath27 appears with a probability density @xmath28 , which is related to the coefficients @xmath23 by : g_r = _ q g_q [ cierre ] it is clear from ( [ cierre ] ) that @xmath28 is a class function , namely it depends only on the conjugacy class of @xmath27 . in the following sections we shall consider only the case in which @xmath29 for any @xmath27 , except the ones consisting in a single exchange . in this case the partition function takes the form : z_n , g(a ) = _ r ( ) ^2 - 2 g e^a [ zetag2 ] where by @xmath30 we denote a transposition , namely a permutation with one cycle of length @xmath31 and @xmath32 cycles of length @xmath33 . in ( [ zetag2 ] )",
    "the area has been redefined to absorb the factor @xmath34 .",
    "the quantity @xmath35 at the exponent is related to the quadratic casimir @xmath36 of a @xmath7 representation whose young diagram coincides with the one associated to the representation @xmath18 of @xmath0 : c_2(r)= n(n-1 ) + nn [ casi ] so the partition function ( [ zetag2 ] ) is the @xmath0 analogue of two dimensional yang - mills partition function , while ( [ zetag ] ) would correspond to a generalized yang - mills theory .",
    "a different way of introducing an additive parameter in the theory is to take the `` area '' proportional to the number of branch points .",
    "this amounts to expanding the partition function ( [ zetag ] ) or ( [ zetag2 ] ) in power series of @xmath22 and to taking as partition function the coefficient of @xmath37 ; in the case of only quadratic branch points the resulting partition function is : z_n , g , p = _ r ( ) ^2 - 2 g ( ) ^p [ zetapi ] where , as already mentioned , @xmath38 is the number of quadratic branch points , and is identified with the `` area . '' ) vanish for odd @xmath38 .",
    "] in fact the partition function ( [ zetapi ] ) can be obtained by starting from a lattice consisting of @xmath38 plaquettes , each by definition of unit area and endowed with just one quadratic branch point .",
    "the boltzmann weight of such plaquettes is : w(p_s)= _ r _ r ( ) _ r(p_s ) , [ plaquette2 ] if the @xmath38 plaquettes are joined together to form a closed surface of genus @xmath9 , then by using the orthogonality properties of the characters one reproduces the partition function ( [ zetapi ] ) . a more general model can be obtained by assigning to each plaquette a probability @xmath39 to have a single quadratic branch point and a probability @xmath40 not to have any branch point at all . this amounts to consider a model with @xmath38 plaquettes of boltzmann weight w(p_s)= _ r ( ( 1-x)d_r + x _ r ( ) ) _",
    "r(p_s ) , [ plaquette3 ] which leads to the following partition function : z_n , g , p(x ) = _ r ( ) ^2 - 2 g",
    "( ( 1-x ) + x ) ^p [ zetapix ] the partition function ( [ zetapix ] ) includes both ( [ zetapi ] ) and ( [ zetag2 ] ) as particular cases .",
    "in fact for @xmath41 the partition function @xmath42 coincides with @xmath43 and z_n , g , p(x ) e^-a z_n , g(a ) [ xzero ] with @xmath44 . in the following sections we shall study the partition functions ( [ zetag2 ] ) , ( [ zetapi ] ) and ( [ zetapix ] ) in the large @xmath1 limit and find that all of them show , on a sphere , a non trivial phase structure in the large @xmath1 limit : namely they display a phase transition at a critical value of the area @xmath38 ( @xmath22 for ( [ zetag2 ] ) ) .    a heuristic argument for the existence of such transition goes as follows : consider a disk of area @xmath38 , with holonomy at the border given by a permutation @xmath27 .",
    "the corresponding partition function ( consider for simplicity the case @xmath41 ) is then z_n , disk , p(q ) = _ r d_r _ r(q ) ( ) ^p [ zetadisk ] clearly for @xmath45 a permutation @xmath27 consisting of a number of exchanges larger than @xmath38 can not be constructed out of @xmath38 quadratic branch points , and @xmath46 is then necessarily zero for such @xmath27 . instead if @xmath47 it is conceivable ( and it will be proved in the following sections ) that all permutations have the same probability to appear on the border and then @xmath48 is independent of @xmath27 and constant in @xmath38 . as a result",
    "we expect in the large @xmath1 limit a phase transition at a critical value of the area , provided @xmath38 is rescaled with @xmath1 in a suitable way .",
    "we will show that a non - trivial phase structure indeed emerges when @xmath38 scales with @xmath49 .",
    "that is , if we put @xmath50 a phase transition occurs in the large @xmath1 limit at a critical value of @xmath51 .",
    "as a sphere is a disk with the holonomy @xmath52 , the same phase transition appears on the sphere as the critical point beyond which the partition function becomes constant in @xmath51 .    in the random",
    "walk approach that we will treat in sec .",
    "4 the same phase transition can be interpreted as a cutoff phenomenon , namely as the existence of a critical value of the number of steps after which the walker has the same probability to be in any point of the lattice .",
    "the more general model ( [ zetapix ] ) has , in the large @xmath1 limit , a phase diagram in the @xmath53 plane , with three different phases whose features we shall also study in the following sections .",
    "the large @xmath1 limit of the symmetric group @xmath0 is quite different from , say , the large @xmath2 limit of u@xmath55 .",
    "the difference consists mainly in the fact that the irreducible representations of su@xmath55 are labeled by young diagrams made by at most @xmath56 rows and an arbitrary number of columns .",
    "therefore in the large @xmath2 limit its rows and columns can simultaneously scale like @xmath2 .",
    "for instance in two dimensional yang mills theory on a sphere or a @xcite the saddle point at large @xmath2 corresponds to a representation whose young diagrams has a number of boxes of order @xmath57 .",
    "instead , the irreducible representations of @xmath0 are in one to one correspondence with the young diagrams made of exactly @xmath1 boxes .",
    "namely the area of the young diagrams , rather than the length of its rows and columns , scales like @xmath1 .",
    "let us first establish some notations .",
    "we shall label the lengths of the rows of the young diagram by the positive integers @xmath58 and the lengths of the columns by @xmath59 , with the constraint that the total number of boxes is equal to @xmath1 : _",
    "i=1^s_1 r_i = _",
    "j=1^r_1 s_j = n [ boxesn ] in order to evaluate the partition functions introduced in the previous section , in particular the ones given in ( [ zetag2]),([zetapi ] ) and ( [ zetapix ] ) , all we need is the explicit expression of the dimension of the representation @xmath19 and of @xmath35 .",
    "these are well known quantities in the theory of the symmetric group , and are given respectively by : d_r = [ dim ] and = ( _ i r_i^2 - _ j s_j^2 ) = [ cas ] the l.h.s .",
    "of ( [ cas ] ) coincides , up to a factor , with the quadratic casimir for the representation of a unitary group associated to the same young diagram",
    ".    as we are interested in the evaluation of these quantities in the large @xmath1 limit , we have first of all to characterize a general young diagram consisting of @xmath1 boxes in the large @xmath1 limit .",
    "the most natural ansatz , in order to have a diagram of area @xmath1 , would be to assume that the columns @xmath60 and the rows @xmath61 scale with @xmath1 respectively as @xmath62 and @xmath63 with @xmath64 .",
    "however this is far from being the most general case , as different parts of the diagram may scale with different powers @xmath51 . to be completely general let us introduce in place of the discrete variables @xmath65 ( resp .",

    "the extrema of @xmath109 and @xmath107 are a direct consequence of ( [ ln ] ) and ( [ dir ] ) respectively . for @xmath109",

    "it is clear from ( [ dir ] ) that the maximum , at fixed @xmath108 , occurs when the whole contribution comes from a diagram with @xmath112 , namely from a young subdiagram where both rows and columns scale as @xmath113 .",
    "the leading term is then : d_r = n n ( 1- ) [ drmax ] .",
    "consider first the partition function ( [ zetapi ] ) on a sphere , namely at @xmath114 .",
    "this can be written as : z_n , g=0,p = _ r e^2 d_r + p [ zetapisph ] in the large @xmath1 limit the exponent at the r.h.s .",
    "of ( [ zetapisph ] ) can be approximated to the leading term by using ( [ chdue ] ) and ( [ drmax ] ) . moreover , as the number of representations only grows like the number of partitions of @xmath1 , namely in the large @xmath1 limit as @xmath115 , their entropy is negligible compared to the leading term in ( [ zetapisph ] ) , and the sum over all representations is given by the contribution of the representation for which the exponent is maximum . as discussed in the previous section such representation",
    "is parametrized by @xmath116 , and we are led to the problem of finding the maximum , with respect to variations of @xmath116 , of n n [ espo ] where , in order to have both terms of the same order in the large @xmath1 limit , we have set p = a n n [ area ] the maximum of ( [ espo ] ) is at @xmath117 .",
    "this solution however is valid only for @xmath118 , as the value of @xmath116 is limited to the interval @xmath119 .",
    "so the model has two phases : for @xmath120 the young diagram of the leading representation consists of a single row ( or column ) of length @xmath121 and a part of area @xmath122 whose rows and columns scale like @xmath113 .",
    "for @xmath123 the sum over the representations is dominated by the representation consisting of a single row ( or column ) of length @xmath1 .",
    "let us consider now the more general model whose partition function is given in ( [ zetapix ] ) .",
    "a difference with respect to the previous case is that @xmath38 does not need to be even , and the symmetry with respect to the exchange of rows and columns in the representations is broken .",
    "so for each value of @xmath116 there are two representations , whose contribution differ for the sign of @xmath124 .",
    "it easy to check from ( [ zetapix ] ) that the contributions coming from representations with positive sign of @xmath124 are always greater in absolute value , and give rise to the leading term in the large @xmath1 limit .",
    "the leading representation is then obtained by finding the value of @xmath116 , constrained by @xmath125 , for which nn [ elibx ] is maximum .",
    "the phase structure is more complicated than in the previous case , and it is represented in the @xmath126 plane in fig .

    "this phase did not exist in the previous case ( @xmath41 ) except for the trivial point @xmath128 .",
    "phase ii and iii are the ones already studied at @xmath41 and correspond respectively to @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "the critical line that separates i from iii can be easily calculated , and is given by : a_i , iii= - [ crita ] while the critical line separating phase ii and iii is simply : a_ii , iii = [ crita2 ] finally the line that separates phase i and phase ii is given by a_i , ii= [ crita3 ] where @xmath131 can be expressed in terms of the coordinate @xmath132 of the triple point : @xmath133 .",

    "however the phase diagram discussed above shows that such naive expectation is not fulfilled everywhere .",
    "this can be understood by calculating the large @xmath1 limit of ( [ zetapix ] ) in a slightly different way .",

    "the variable @xmath39 ranges from @xmath98 to a maximum value @xmath241 and similarly @xmath242 ranges from @xmath98 to @xmath243 .",
