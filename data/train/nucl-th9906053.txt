    "the @xmath7 and @xmath0 reactions play important roles in astrophysics .",
    "the former process is an important ingredient in big - bang nucleosynthesis , while the latter one is a key reaction in the solar p - p ( proton - proton ) chains .",
    "the @xmath0 reaction produces @xmath5be in our sun , which is destroyed by either the capture of an electron or a proton in the @xmath8 process . in both cases ,",
    "neutrinos are generated which are observable by terrestrial detectors and thus contribute to the solar neutrino problems @xcite .",
    "the production rate of @xmath5be in the sun is determined by the competition of the @xmath0 and @xmath9 reactions .",
    "therefore , the precise knowledge of these cross sections at the most effective solar energies ( @xmath10@xmath11 kev ) is an important input to solar models and to the possible solution of the solar neutrino problems .    there",
    "exist several measurements on the @xmath12 cross section down to energies of about 100 kev . from these data ,",
    "the reaction rate at solar energies is obtained by extrapolation .",
    "the @xmath13 fusion reaction at low energies is usually viewed as an approximate external capture process @xcite .",
    "thus , the energy dependence of the cross section can then be obtained from a simple @xmath13 potential model , which in fact reproduces the energy dependence of the measured data rather well .",
    "the most recent compilation of the data quotes the @xmath14 cross section as @xmath15 kevb @xcite , where the rather small uncertainty mainly reflects differences in the absolute normalization of the cross section . as customary ,",
    "we have used the standard s - factor parametrization of the cross section ( the subscript ` 34 ' stands for @xmath13 ) @xmath16 } , \\hskip 0.5 cm \\eta ( e)={{\\mu z_1z_2e^2}\\over{k\\hbar^2}},\\ ] ] where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the charge numbers of the fragments in the incoming channel , while @xmath19 and @xmath20 are their reduced mass and wave number , respectively .",
    "there exist also more elaborate theoretical studies of the @xmath7 and @xmath0 reactions in the literature , which are based on the resonating group method or the related microscopic potential model @xcite .",
    "these microscopic studies , based on a single @xmath13 fragmentation , yield an energy dependence of the @xmath0 cross section , which is similar to the potential models .",
    "furthermore as a success of these approaches , they correctly predicted @xcite the low - energy @xmath7 cross section in absolute normalization and energy dependence , which has been subsequently confirmed by the precision measurement of brune _ et al .",
    ".    why do we then want to study these low - energy reactions again ? despite its apparently successful agreement with data , the dependence of the cross section on the enlargement of the model space has not been yet established .",
    "a first attempt has been made by mertelmeier and hofmann @xcite who included additionally a @xmath21 configuration in their model space .",
    "this multichannel rgm calculation shows a somewhat increased s - factor compared to the single - channel case , while the rise towards lower energies is reduced .",
    "given the astrophysical relevance it is important to determine whether this weaker energy dependence is physical or an artifact caused by the approximate treatment of the asymptotic whittaker functions in the bound states .",
    "second , we have found in ref .",
    "@xcite that taking into account the @xmath21 clusterization changes some of the key properties of the @xmath5be bound states considerably . for example , the @xmath5be quadrupole moment is increased by about @xmath22 @xmath23@xmath24 if the @xmath21 configuration is added to the dominant @xmath13 clusterization .    in the present work we study the @xmath25 and @xmath7 reactions in an extended two - cluster model , which can take into account the @xmath26 clusterization , in addition to the more important @xmath27 configurations .",
    "our main goal is to explore how much the energy dependence of the low - energy @xmath12 cross section is affected by the addition of the @xmath21 configuration .",
    "the simultaneous study of the @xmath7 reaction serves as a potential check , as in this case the low - energy cross section is known rather well .",
    "our study of the @xmath0 and @xmath7 reactions is based on the microscopic cluster model . as a model space",
    "we adopt the dominant @xmath28 clusterization , to which the @xmath3 configuration is added as well . for comparison",
    ", we also perform calculations based solely on the @xmath29 clusterization ; in this case our studies correspond to the microscopic calculations presented in @xcite .",
    "our wave functions thus have the general form @xmath30_{1/2}\\chi_l(\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\rho $ } _ 1)\\big ] _ { jm}\\bigg\\}+ \\sum_{l , s}{\\cal a}\\bigg\\{\\big [ \\big[\\phi^{^6{\\rm li}}\\phi^p\\big]_s \\chi_l(\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\rho $ } _ 2)\\big ] _ { jm}\\bigg\\ } \\label{be7}\\ ] ] and @xmath31_{1/2}\\chi_l(\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\rho $ } _ 1)\\big ] _ { jm}\\bigg\\}+ \\sum_{l , s}{\\cal a}\\bigg\\{\\big [ \\big[\\phi^{^6{\\rm li}}\\phi^n\\big]_s \\chi_l(\\mbox{\\boldmath",

    "the spin - parity of the @xmath42li ground state is @xmath43 , and the total parity is @xmath44 . using ( [ be7 ] ) or ( [ li7 ] ) in the seven - nucleon schrdinger equation , we arrive at an equation for the intercluster relative motion functions @xmath45 .",
    "these equations must be solved with high precision up to large @xmath46 value , because the electromagnetic transition strengths are shifted towards large @xmath46 at the low solar energies . for the @xmath2 scattering",
    "we neglect the @xmath47 channels and solve the relative - motion equations by using the variational kohn - hulthn method @xcite . for the bound states we use a version of the so - called siegert variational method , which was first applied in cluster model calculations by fiebig and weiguny @xcite . in this method",
    "the relative motions @xmath45 are expanded in terms of square integrable functions ( gaussians in our case ) plus a term with the correct asymptotics .",
    "we study only e1 transitions here . after setting up the initial scattering wave functions and final bound states ,",
    "the e1 cross section is calculated @xcite as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the electric dipole ( @xmath50 ) transition operator , @xmath51 represents the entrance channel , @xmath52 is the photon energy , and @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the total spin of the final and initial state , respectively .",
    "the initial wave function @xmath55 is a partial wave of a unit - flux scattering wave function .",
    "meaningful cluster calculations of the @xmath12 and @xmath7 reactions within our chosen model space of @xmath2 and @xmath26 configurations should satisfy the following conditions : ( i ) the experimental value of the @xmath56 ground state energy with respect to the @xmath2 threshold must be reproduced ; ( ii ) the experimental value of the spin - orbit splitting between the @xmath57 and @xmath58 states in @xmath56 has to be correct ; ( iii ) in the extended model spaces the @xmath3 threshold must be at the right position , relative to @xmath2 . besides calculations for the extended model space @xmath59 , we also perform studies in the single - channel @xmath2 model space , corresponding to the previous calculations ( e.g.  @xcite ) . in the later case only constraints ( i ) and ( ii ) have been fulfilled by adjustments of the nn interaction .",
    "the internal structure of the @xmath42li cluster is described in our model as an @xmath60 clusterization with an @xmath61-wave deuteron and @xmath62 relative motion between the @xmath63 and @xmath64 clusters .",
    "varying the size parameters of the @xmath63 and @xmath64 clusters inside @xmath42li should allow us to satisfy condition ( iii ) , while the other two conditions can be met by fine - tuning the effective nucleon - nucleon interaction . in our previous multicluster study of the @xmath8 reaction ,",
    "the minnesota ( mn ) force @xcite has been identified as the most reliable interaction .",
    "therefore we will also use it in the present calculation , even at the expense that it slightly overestimates the total cross sections for both reactions studied here . in the mn interaction , the exchange mixture parameter ( @xmath65 ) and spin - orbit strength are those parameters that are slightly varied .",
    "additionally , we perform calculations with the mhn interaction @xcite which , as shown by kajino , reproduces the measured cross section data for both reactions in a single - channel @xmath2 model quite well .    choosing the cluster size parameter @xmath66 @xmath67 and by fine - tuning the mn interaction we have exactly reproduced the binding energies of the two bound states in @xmath5be and @xmath5li with respect to the @xmath63+h / t threshold .",
    "this leads to @xmath68 and @xmath69 mev , @xmath70 and @xmath71 mev , @xmath72 and @xmath73 mev , and @xmath74 and @xmath75 mev , respectively for the exchange mixture parameter of the central force and the strength of the spin - orbit force in the cases of one - channel @xmath5li , two - channel @xmath5li , one - channel @xmath5be , and two - channel @xmath5be , respectively . for the @xmath42li binding energy",
    "we calculate 1.43 mev , to be compared with the experimental value of 1.475 mev @xcite . in the case of the mhn interaction , by choosing @xmath76 @xmath67 and fine - tuning the @xmath77 parameter in the gaussian of medium - size range ( the sum of the wigner and majorana parameters is kept fixed at the original mhn value ) , we reproduce the binding energies in @xmath5be and @xmath5li , while , however , the @xmath3 threshold energy is overestimated by about 1.5 mev , relative to @xmath2 ; i.e.  condition ( iii ) can not be satisfied .",
    "the corresponding potential parameters , following the same order as above , are @xmath78 and @xmath79 mev , @xmath80 and @xmath81 mev , @xmath78 and @xmath82 mev , and @xmath83 and @xmath84 mev , respectively , where @xmath85 is the strength of the long - range spin - orbit force .    in the partial waves which contribute significantly to the capture cross sections , our interactions give generally more repulsive higher - energy phase shifts than those indicated by phenomenological analyses . as an example , we show our @xmath86 phase shifts in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "it is particularly noteworthy that the phase shifts are more repulsive in the two - channel calculations than in the one - channel case .",
    "this is related to the fact that the point - nucleon matter radius of the combined nucleus increases by the enlargement of the model space ( see tables [ tab1 ] and [ tab2 ] below ) .",
    "the s - factors , calculated for the extended and single - channel model spaces and both interactions , are compared to the data in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . as mentioned above , in the single - channel case the mn interaction overestimates the low - energy @xmath0 and @xmath7 reactions , while the mhn force agrees with the data quite well .",
    "however , more importantly for the present study , the extended model space yields noticeably larger s - factors than in the single - channel model ( the reason for this increase will be discussed below ) for both interactions .",
    "but we also note that the slope of the low - energy s - factor changes slightly when comparing the results for the two model spaces .",
    "this finding can be quantified by the value of @xmath87 which decreases from @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) mev@xmath90 to @xmath89 ( @xmath91 ) mev@xmath90 for the mn ( mhn ) interaction in the case of the @xmath13 fusion reaction , if we add the @xmath21 configuration .",
    "this result is our first indication that the reaction can not be treated as a totally external process . as a consequence , the usual strategy to adopt the energy dependence of a potential model s - factor and normalize it to",
    "the measured data becomes slightly questionable as it explicitly assumes that the model differs from the data only by the asymptotic normalization constant .    in order to explore the origin of the cross section changes between the extended and single - channel model spaces ,",
    "we employ a strategy already applied in @xcite and , for the @xmath8 reaction , in @xcite . using the mn interaction for this exploration we repeat the calculations for different cluster size parameters ( @xmath92 and 0.56 @xmath67 ) and try to observe correlations between @xmath4 and other observables in @xmath5be and @xmath5li , respectively .",
    "the calculations have been performed again in both the single - channel @xmath2 and the extended @xmath59 model space . while the above conditions ( i)@xmath93(iii ) could be fulfilled in each study by a suited adjustment of the interaction ,",
    "the @xmath42li ground state energy is now underbound relative to the @xmath60 threshold ; we find @xmath94 mev and @xmath95 mev for @xmath92 and 0.56 @xmath67 , respectively . as a consequence of this underbinding ,",
    "the @xmath60 separation in the @xmath42li ground state is too large . at the same time , the radius of the @xmath63 particle inside @xmath42li gets smaller , if @xmath96 is increased from 0.4 @xmath67 to 0.56 @xmath67 .",
    "these too effects together will render the results obtained for @xmath92 @xmath67 and 0.56 @xmath67 rather unphysical , but might still allow to draw conclusions about the correlations of the cross section with other @xmath5be and @xmath5li properties .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we demonstrate the effect of the cluster size parameter on the elastic phase shifts , exemplified for the two - channel study of the @xmath37he+@xmath35he reaction .",
    "we observe that the phase shifts get increasingly more attractive if the width parameter @xmath96 increases .",
    "this is related to the fact that , with increasing @xmath96 , the sizes of the combined nuclei @xmath5li and @xmath5be shrink ( see tables 1 and 2 ) . without explicitly showing it in a figure , we note that the dependence of the phase shifts on the cluster size parameter is slightly stronger in the one - channel case .",
    "tables [ tab1 ] and [ tab2 ] list our results for the zero - energy cross sections , @xmath4 , and the quadrupole moments and point - nucleon matter rms radii of @xmath5be and @xmath5li .    .calculated quadrupole moments ( @xmath6 ) and point - nucleon matter rms radii ( @xmath97 ) of @xmath5be , and the zero - energy astrophysical s - factor [ @xmath4 ] and its derivative [ @xmath87 ] of the @xmath12 reaction in the various model spaces .",
    "the entries denoted by @xmath100 are for the mhn interaction , while the rest is for the mn force . [ cols=\"<,>,<,>,<,>,<,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , @xmath4 and the quadrupole moment @xmath6 of @xmath56 are nicely correlated in the single - channel @xmath2 models .",
    "although the results of the @xmath59 model space with @xmath101 @xmath67 fit well into the trend , the results for @xmath92 and 0.56 @xmath67 do not .",
    "we believe that in the case of @xmath5be this is due to the disappearing @xmath60 binding energy inside @xmath42li , while for @xmath5li , it is caused by the adverse behavior of the @xmath63 and @xmath42li sizes .    the correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath6 , shown in fig",
    ".  [ fig4 ] , can easily be understood by recalling that for external capture reactions , at energies deep below the coulomb barrier , the @xmath4 cross section is practically fully determined by the asymptotic normalization constants of the bound state wave functions ; the @xmath8 is a well - known example @xcite .",
    "these normalization constants in turn are sensitive mainly to the radii of the effective @xmath102 potentials .",
    "while going from @xmath76 to 0.4 @xmath67 in the @xmath2 model , the sizes of the clusters ( and thus the radii of the @xmath102 potentials ) increase , which explains the increase in @xmath4 and @xmath6 .",
    "when the @xmath3 channel is added , @xmath4 is further increased .",
    "note that @xmath42li is bigger than @xmath56 .",
    "thus the radii of the @xmath102 potentials are effectively increased by adding the @xmath3 component .    as we have already pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath21 channel has a substantial effect on the quadrupole moment of @xmath103 .",
    "as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) , the inclusion of the @xmath104 channel in the @xmath101 @xmath67 model results in a roughly 10% increase in @xmath6 . at the same time , the extension of the @xmath105 model space leads to just a 1.6% increase in the quadrupole moment of that nucleus .",
    "the explanation of this phenomenon is natural : the @xmath21 configuration brings in a large charge polarization , which strongly affects the quadrupole moment of @xmath5be , while there is no such effect for @xmath5li .    in ref .",
    "@xcite kajino suggested to determine the zero - energy @xmath0 astrophysical s - factor indirectly from the correlations between @xmath106 and the quadrupole moment of @xmath5li .",
    "this proposal , however , is spoiled if the @xmath5li quadrupole moment is indeed as large as @xmath107 @xmath23@xmath24 , as currently favored @xcite , and thus noticeably different than the value of @xmath108 @xmath23@xmath24 @xcite , accepted at the time kajino performed his analysis . from fig",
    "[ fig4 ] we observe that the large @xmath6-value corresponds to a cross section @xmath109 kevb for the @xmath7 reaction , which is about twice the value derived from the precision data of @xcite .",
    "this apparent shortcoming might point to the necessity to explicitly consider the interference with the internal @xmath42li quadrupole moment in cluster studies .",
    "as we mentioned , our @xmath4 values were determined by fitting the calculated @xmath110 functions by a polynomial form between 0.1 and 0.9 mev .",
    "additionally , tables [ tab1 ] and [ tab2 ] list the results for @xmath87 .",
    "in addition to this fit , we tested another functional form for the low - energy s - factors , suggested in ref .",
    "the @xmath111 expression reflects the fact that s has a pole at the binding energy @xmath112 of @xmath56 , relative to the @xmath2 threshold . in order to get good fits even at rather low energies",
    ", we needed to use higher - order terms in the numerator of eq .",
    "( [ pole ] ) .",
    "this shows the importance of the non - asymptotic contributions to the cross sections . with a fourth - order polynomial in the numerator in eq.([pole ] ) , we get practically the same results as shown in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "one might conclude from our results that the @xmath113 values , as determined in ref .",
    "@xcite or in ref .",
    "@xcite ( for both the @xmath5be and @xmath5li reactions ) , are more uncertain than currently believed .",
    "this is in agreement with the recent results of the nacre compilation @xcite . here",
    "the authors recommend to fit the low - energy @xmath7 s - factor by the polynomial @xmath114 .",
    "this would imply @xmath115 .",
    "this value is quite different from the one ( @xmath116 ) found in @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have studied the @xmath117 and @xmath0 reactions in an extended two - cluster model that can take into account @xmath3 rearrangement channels .",
    "we have found that the inclusion of the @xmath118 channel significantly affects the reaction cross sections and some key properties of @xmath5be and @xmath5li .",
    "for the known correlations between the cross sections and , e.g. , the quadrupole moments of @xmath5be and @xmath5li the results of the extended model ( provided the @xmath42li binding energy is described sufficiently accurate ) fit well into the trend , which is predicted by the simpler @xmath2 description .",
    "we have pointed out that the value of @xmath106 , determined from the @xmath119 correlation in ref .",
    "@xcite , seems now to be in conflict with the new accepted value of @xmath120 quadrupole moment .",
    "finally we have discussed that the low - energy slope of the @xmath12 cross section , i.e. the value of @xmath113 , might be more uncertain than currently believed .",
    "further studies in significantly larger model spaces ( e.g. , using a full seven - body dynamical description ) will be interesting to see how well the present - day @xmath2 cluster models reflect the true nature of the @xmath5be and @xmath5li nuclei .",
