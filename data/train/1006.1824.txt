    "when a gas of atoms or molecules is subjected to a strong laser field , high - harmonic generation ( hhg ) takes place @xcite .",
    "this process converts many of the laser photons into a single high - frequency photon in the extreme ultraviolet ( xuv ) or soft x - ray regime .",
    "the generation process can be understood in terms of the three - step model @xcite .",
    "first , the electron tunnels out under the influence of the laser field , and then it propagates freely in the laser field and can be driven back to the nucleus , where it can finally recombine .",
    "hhg has been used to generate coherent xuv radiation @xcite .",
    "concerning hhg from molecules , there has been a lot of attention of the community recently toward the relationship between the emitted radiation and molecular characteristics .",
    "one can for instance determine the internuclear distance in the diatomic molecules h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 and to a lesser extent co@xmath1 and o@xmath1 from a destructive interference minimum in the harmonic spectrum @xcite or reconstruct molecular orbitals from the emitted radiation @xcite .",
    "the correct explanation of the minimum in co@xmath1 , however , appears to require a multiorbital treatment @xcite .",
    "recent experiments on n@xmath1 indicate multiorbital contributions as well @xcite . preparing molecules to control",
    "the harmonic emission is also possible : ring current states were used theoretically to generate circularly polarized high harmonics @xcite .    in the three - step model @xcite or its quantum - mechanical formulation in terms of the strong - field approximation ( sfa ) @xcite , due to wave - packet",
    "spreading the on - axis continuum wave packet carries practically no signature of the ground - state wave function at the moment of recombination .",
    "therefore , the molecular characteristics imprinted on the emitted spectra must come from the recombination step ( or from multiorbital interference ) . in the existing practical molecular imaging techniques",
    "the influence of the laser field on the recombination step and often also the effect of the coulomb potential on the propagation step are ignored . to study the effects of these approximations ,",
    "we perform a numerical comparison between the harmonics emitted in a normal laser - induced hhg process and harmonics emitted when an artificially prepared wave packet collides with the molecular ion in the absence of any laser pulse @xcite .",
    "additionally , we compare the harmonics generated by both physical and artificial laser pulses to disentangle the influence of the different harmonic trajectories .",
    "we show that elliptically polarized hhg radiation from linearly polarized generating pulses occurs near the two - center interference .",
    "elliptical polarization of harmonics from linearly polarized generating pulses was also found in recent experiments @xcite .",
    "in this article  we solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) numerically in two dimensions for a molecular ion with a single electron .",
    "we consider two dimensions because in 2d many of the 3d characteristics of hhg are already present , such as the existence of directions perpendicular and parallel to the laser polarization axis . on the other hand",
    ", the tdse can be solved very quickly , allowing the tdse to be solved for many alignment angles of the molecule in the laser field .",
    "the tdse is solved using the split - operator method @xcite , and the ground - state wave function is found by imaginary - time propagation @xcite .",
    "atomic units are used throughout this article  unless indicated otherwise .",

    "@xmath18 is a standardly used temporal window that prevents high - frequency artifacts at the boundaries of the integration .    for h@xmath0 , one observes a minimum in the spectrum of emitted radiation polarized in the @xmath9-direction because of interference between the two centers of the molecule @xcite .",
    "using the plane - wave approximation for the returning electron , the ( first and usually only observable ) minimum occurs when the @xmath9-projection of the internuclear distance as seen by the returning wave packet is equal to half the de broglie wavelength . therefore the minimum will shift toward higher harmonics with higher angles between the laser polarization and molecular axis .",
    "since it is a structural minimum that depends only on the geometry of the bound state , one expects to see no shifts in the location of the minimum when different laser pulses are used or when instead gaussian wave packets are used to generate harmonics in a laser - field - free electron - ion collision @xcite .    for the wave - packet simulation without laser field ,",

    "we assume that @xmath98 is alignment independent over the range of the two - center minimum , as also indicated by numerical tests that we have performed , and that the alignment dependence of @xmath97 comes purely from the two - center interference with the phase lag @xmath119 , i.e. , @xmath120 @xcite .",
    "then the variation @xmath121 of the polarization direction on varying @xmath8 in the vicinity of @xmath116 is proportional to @xmath122 .",
    "thus the width @xmath123 should be such that @xmath124 is independent of harmonic frequency , provided that @xmath125 is frequency independent .",
    "the brown line in fig .",
    "[ fig : polarization3 ] is obtained for @xmath123 if we set @xmath124 arbitrarily equal to @xmath126 using @xmath127 .",
    "a comparison between the brown line and the other curves shows that at the high end of the spectrum the decrease in @xmath117 can not be explained any more exclusively by the geometric effect .",
    "since @xmath116 varies very slowly in this range , we expect only a slow variation in @xmath125 .",
    "this suggests that decreasing coulomb effects play a role , in accordance with fig .",
    "[ fig : intensity2 ] , where for harmonics 5080 we observe a transition toward the curve predicted by the sfa dispersion relationship , also indicating decreasing coulomb effects in this range .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : ellipticity1 ] we plot the ellipticity @xmath88 of the emitted radiation for harmonic 49 as a function of @xmath8 . again",
    "the polarization data was averaged over one harmonic order using the intensities as weights .",
    "the plot shows that both a gaussian wave packet and different laser pulses give rise to both significant and varying elliptical emission .",
    "nonzero ellipticity means that the harmonics in the @xmath9 and @xmath13-directions are emitted with different phases .",
    "using the plane - wave approximation for the returning electron , one would not expect to see any ellipticity for a symmetric molecule @xcite .",
    "since the ionization and propagation step are identical for the two components of the radiation , the ellipticity must come from the recombination step .",
    "therefore , this result confirms that the coulomb effects can lead to significant ellipticity .",
    "the ellipticity for parallel or perpendicular alignment is zero , because at these alignment angles , the perpendicular component of the emitted radiation vanishes .",
    "-pulse ( red dashed line ) , a five - cycle @xmath44-pulse ( blue dotted line ) , and a fifteen - cycle trapezoidal pulse ( green dot - dashed line ) . ]",
    "the ellipticity goes through zero at some intermediate alignment angle .",
    "if we plot the angle of zero ellipticity as a function of harmonic order , we arrive at fig .",
    "[ fig : ellipticity2 ] .",
    "this plot shows that in the close vicinity of the two - center interference minimum , the ellipticity goes through zero .",
    "this is as expected , because at the location of the minimum , the @xmath9-component of the emitted radiation is very small . because the @xmath9-component has opposite signs before and after the minimum , the ellipticity changes handedness through the minimum .    for each harmonic",
    ", we can also plot the extrema of the ellipticity that can be reached and the alignment angles at which those extrema are reached .",
    "the results are shown in figs .  [",
    "fig : ellipticity3 ] and [ fig : ellipticity4 ] , respectively .        .",
    "same wave packets and pulses as in fig .",
    "[ fig : ellipticity3 ] . ]",
    "we observe that for sufficiently high harmonic orders , the ellipticity extrema become smaller in absolute value and move closer to the two - center interference minimum with increasing harmonic order .",
    "since the ellipticity is an indicator of non - plane - wave character , the decreasing ellipticity is another signature of decreasing coulomb effects for higher harmonic orders , which correspond to higher return momenta .",
    "when a gaussian wave packet collides with an aligned h@xmath0-molecule , the resulting harmonic spectrum has a structural minimum from the two - center interference between the two lobes of the orbital .",
    "the position of this minimum is reproduced using an effective plane - wave momentum that transitions from the @xmath52-corrected @xmath50 at low harmonics to the sfa - based @xmath128 at high harmonics .",
    "a laser - induced hhg spectrum shows the same behavior if only a single electronic trajectory contributes per harmonic , as is the case for a typical experimental setup .",
    "this justifies using hhg for molecular imaging as the laser field has no significant effect on the amplitude of the recombination matrix element .",
    "when a single set of short and long electron trajectories contributes to the spectrum , the interference between the two trajectories causes a large but regular oscillation around the general trend .",
    "introducing more and longer trajectories by using longer pulses has the effect of averaging out the oscillations to a smaller scattering around the gaussian - wave - packet result and leads to a smoother interference minimum as a function of @xmath8 .",
    "our results show that the effect of the coulomb potential can lead to significant ellipticity of the emitted radiation . around the interference minimum",
    ", the main polarization angle makes a @xmath83-jump and the ellipticity goes through zero .",
    "the coulomb effects are less important at higher harmonics .",
    "therefore we observe decreasing overall ellipticity and a relatively sharp jump in the polarization direction at the high end of the spectrum .    in the wave - packet calculations ,",
    "the coulomb effects could be investigated in more detail by changing the strength of the potential for the evolution of the continuum part .",
    "this may be subject of future work .",
    "finally , we mention that for randomly oriented molecules , the perpendicular harmonic components and thereby also the ellipticity vanish due to the cylindrical symmetry of the system around the laser polarization axis .",
    "the behavior of the phase is more complicated . since , however , hhg is dominated in our case by the large orientation angles for geometrical reasons , we do not expect a clear signature of the phase jump for randomly oriented molecules .",
