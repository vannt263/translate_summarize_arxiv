    "heavy quarks are good probes to study the properties of strongly interacting matter , quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) . due to their large masses , they are produced mainly during initial hard parton scatterings at rhic , before the qgp phase .",
    "they are expected to interact with the medium differently from the light quarks . hot nuclear matter effects , such as heavy quark inteactions with the qgp , change the heavy quark kinematic distribution but do not change the total heavy quark yield .",
    "due to energy loss of heavy quarks in the qgp , their transverse momentum @xmath4 distributions in heavy ion collisions may fall steeper than those in p+p collisions . at small @xmath4 , heavy quarks may thermalize with the medium and exhibit collective flow effects @xcite .    at rhic",
    ", heavy quarks could be studied by measuring npe which are produced from semileptonic decays of d and b mesons .",
    "measurements of npe provide information on heavy quarks energy loss and elliptic flow in the hot and dense nuclear matter created in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "hot nuclear matter effects could be quantified by the nuclear modification factor ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "@xmath1 is defined as the ratio of the number of particles produced in nucleus - nucleus collisions to that in proton - proton collisions , scaled by the average number of binary collisions for a given centrality .",
    "@xmath5 may indicate heavy quark energy loss . in the case",
    "there are no medium effects the nuclear modification factor will be equal to unity .",
    "data reported in this proceedings were collected in p+p collisions at @xmath0 gev in 2009 , and in au+au collisions at @xmath3 gev in 2010 with minimum bias ( mb ) and high tower ( ht ) triggers , where mb triggered data are used for @xmath6 gev/@xmath7 results and high tower triggered data for @xmath8 gev@xmath9c results .",
    "the time projection chamber ( tpc ) is the primary tracking device for charged particle momentum determination at star .",
    "information from the tpc was used for particle identification together with information from the barrel electromagnetic calorimeter ( bemc ) , and the time of flight ( tof ) detector .",
    "the bemc was used for high @xmath10 electron energy measurement and online trigger .",
    "the tof detector was used to reduce hadron contamination at low @xmath10 .",
    "electron candidates are identified via ionization energy loss measured by the tpc combined with tof velocity information , which together provide good pid capability at low-@xmath10 region .",
    "electrons at high-@xmath10 are selected using the ratio of the track momentum and the energy deposited in the bemc , the bsmd shower profile , and the distance between tpc track projected position at bemc and reconstructed bemc cluster position .",
    "the raw npe yield is calculated as : @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is npe yield , @xmath13 represents inclusive electron candidate yield , @xmath14 is the purity of inclusive electron sample , @xmath15 is the yield of reconstructed photonic electron background , which mainly originates from photon conversion in the detector material and from dalitz decay of @xmath16 or @xmath17 mesons , and @xmath18 represents the photonic electron reconstruction efficiency .",
