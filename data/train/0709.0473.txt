    "the egg nebula is a prototypical bipolar pre - planetary nebula ( ppn ) : in the optical , the direct light from the central star is obscured by dust , while two lobes aligned along a `` polar axis '' scatter the starlight towards the observer @xcite . yet , at longer wavelengths , the egg nebula reveals a more complex geometry : multiple co outflows in the equatorial plane and at higher latitude @xcite ; dusty knots ( peak a ) and a dark lane at a pa=140  @xcite ; and h@xmath0 ( 2.12 ) emission line spatially coincident with the obscuring dust in the equatorial plane @xcite .",
    "the models presented in @xcite or @xcite do nt explain some of these features such as the existence of the multiple outflows .",
    "+ we present some of the near - infrared imaging and imaging - spectroscopy results at high spatial ( @xmath10.1 ) and spectral ( @xmath260 ) resolution from the egg nebula obtained with the keck ii laser guide star adaptive optics ( lgs - ao ) system .",
    "these lgs - ao images of the central regions show details on the dusty knots and the h@xmath0 emission with un - precedent spatial resolution .",
    "combined with acs / hst f606w images and lgs - ao 3-d imaging spectroscopy through the h@xmath0 line , we analyze the detailed structure of the outflows for the eastern part of the nebula . we tentatively propose that multiple highly collimated outflows , launched by intermittent and precessing mechanism could explain the egg morphology . a paper describing the full nirc2 imaging data set , compared to visible hst acs and including an analysis of the 3-d imaging spectroscopy over all outflows is in preparation @xcite .",
    "in july 2004 , we used the ao - dedicated near infrared camera nirc2 behind the keck ii laser guide star ( lgs ) adaptive optics ( ao ) system @xcite , @xcite , to record broad - band and narrow - band images .",
    "earlier lgs - ao observations of the egg were reported in @xcite and suffered from variable image quality . later in 2006 ,",

    "the map of continuum - subtracted h@xmath0 flux ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] bottom left ) shows that the h@xmath0 emission is not uniformly distributed over the observed region , but rather appears as 4 to 6 clumpy knots of angular size of @xmath2 1  or less , roughly aligned along an arc joining the east lobe to the n lobe .",

    "we measure a velocity shift amplitude for this part of the nebula of 100 , a factor 2 higher than previous work @xcite .",
    "the highest projected velocities are found near ( but not at ) peak a , at smaller spatial scales ( @xmath1 0.3 ) which could not be probed in earlier studies .",
    "the high - velocity outflows north of the central star ( cross ) coincide with the clumpy h@xmath0 knots closer to the n lobe and could be associated with a precessing jet , suggested in  [ sec:2.1 ] .",
    "from the preliminary analysis of our data sets , we conclude 1 ) the absence of continuum light in most ouflows , 2 ) a distribution of h@xmath0 emission coincident with dense , dusty clumps , 3 ) a possible nascent outflow at the peak a location , and 4 ) the existence of fast highly - collimated ouflows , possibly jets . we stress that any qualitative model must account for the non - detection of continuum light in the equatorial outflows , in contrast to the polar ones .",
    "the continuum light from the central star must be heavily obscured either in the equatorial ouflow cavity or before it reaches the cavity .",
    "we speculate a possible shaping mechanism that could account for these observables : the central engine of the egg is heavily obscured by a cocoon of dust and intermittent jet - like outflows may be launched by mhd mechanisms within the vicinity of the central engine @xcite .",
    "an outflow would break through the dust cocoon , heating and dissipating the surrounding dust and expands for a few hundreds of years @xcite .",
    "the continuum starlight would propagate through the cavity and be scattered .",
    "shocked emission would be detected primarly at the tip of the outflow .",
    "eventually , the continuum starlight becomes heavily obscured by dust again .",
    "in addition , new outflows would be launched rapidly and account for the multiple outflows with comparable dynamical age @xcite .",
    "the outflows where only h@xmath0 shocked emission is detected would correspond to past outflows .",
    "+ we are currently completing lgs high - spatial imaging spectroscopy over the entire nebula to further constrain the kinematics and discuss the possible launch mechanism for the outflows .",
