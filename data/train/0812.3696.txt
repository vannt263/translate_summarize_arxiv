    "a great deal of attention has been focused recently on the creation of strong nonlinear effects in single coherently prepared multi - level atoms  @xcite .",
    "the motivation for this interest is to fabricate an atomic medium with giant nonlinear properties produced with relatively low light powers .",
    "a particular attention has been paid to the third - order kerr - type nonlinearities which play an important role in nonlinear optics and have many fascinating applications in different areas of physics ranging from phase modulation  @xcite , generation of optical solitons  @xcite , optical switching  @xcite to optical communication and computing  @xcite .",
    "important for practical applications is to achieve enhanced or giant kerr nonlinearities in an atomic medium with significantly reduced or even completely cancelled absorption rate for the propagating light beam .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have proposed a scheme to produce giant kerr nonlinearities together with reduced absorption , by using quantum interference effects related to electromagnetically induced transparency . in a four - level double - dark resonance system",
    ", kerr nonlinearity can be enhanced several orders of magnitude accompanied by vanishing linear absorption under the condition of the effective interaction of double dark resonances  @xcite . a number of different atomic schemes",
    "have been suggested to achieve a large nonlinearity with vanishing absorption  @xcite .",
    "more recently , niu and gong  @xcite and yan _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have shown that the kerr nonlinearity can be enhanced with vanishing linear and nonlinear absorptions due to the spontaneously generated coherence  @xcite .",
    "the major obstacle in experimental investigations of the nonlinear properties of multi - level atoms is the difficulty to find suitable systems to create quantum interference effects between atomic transitions responsible for the cancelation of the absorption of a propagating field .",
    "most of the schemes proposed have assumed that the quantum interference occurs between two transitions with parallel or anti - parallel dipole moments . in atoms with quantum states close in energy the dipole moments are usually perpendicular .",
    "therefore , several schemes have been suggested to engineer quantum interference effects in atoms with perpendicular dipole moments .",
    "most of the schemes suggests to use single - mode optical cavities with preselected polarization in bad cavity limit   @xcite .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have found that the purcell effect @xcite can substantially influence the kerr nonlinearity .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a method to produce self- and cross - kerr photonic nonlinearities using light induced stark shifts arising from the interaction of a cavity mode with atoms . in addition to the purcell effect which is substantial in optical cavities , where spontaneous transitions occur only at selected frequencies , a cavity - induced quantum interference is expected to arise which is analog of the spontaneously generated interference  @xcite .",
    "thus , a question arises , to what extent a combination of the purcell effect and the cavity - induced interference effects will affect the susceptibility of driven @xmath0-type three - level atom .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to address this question and discuss in detail the possibility of obtaining giant kerr nonlinearities .",
    "we consider a three - level atom in the @xmath0 configuration in which one of the two dipole allowed transitions is driven by a strong laser field while the other is probed by a weak beam .",
    "the atomic transitions are simultaneously coupled to a tunable single - mode cavity .",
    "our interest will be centered principally on the effect of the cavity on the third - order susceptibility and determine if the driven system possesses enhanced or giant nonlinearities accompanied by vanishing absorption .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ ch2 ]",
    ", we introduce our model and outline the major steps in the derivation of the equations of motion for the density matrix elements . the iterative analytical solution for the coherences determining the susceptibility",
    "is presented in section  [ ch3 ] .",
    "the results are presented graphically and discussed in section  [ ch4 ] .",
    "we show the influences of the cavity field frequency , the cavity field - atom coupling constants and the atomic decay constants on the real and imaginary parts of the linear and nonlinear susceptibilities .",
    "we summarize our results in section  [ ch5 ] .",
    "we consider a @xmath0-type three - level atom composed of two excited states @xmath1 and @xmath2 coupled to a common ground state @xmath3 by transition dipole moments @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the atom is located inside a single - mode cavity field of frequency @xmath6 and polarization  @xmath7 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    .",
    "the atomic transition @xmath8 is driven by a strong laser field of frequency @xmath9 and is probed by a weak laser field of a tunable frequency @xmath10 coupled to the @xmath11 transition .",
    "each of the two laser fields couples only to one of the atomic dipole transitions , while the cavity field couples to both transitions.,width=302 ]    the polarization @xmath7 is chosen such that the cavity field is simultaneously coupled to both atomic transitions with the coupling strengths @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the atomic transition @xmath14 is driven by a strong laser field of frequency @xmath9 , whereas the @xmath15 transition is probed by a weak tunable laser beam of frequency @xmath10 .",
    "the cavity mode is damped at the rate @xmath16 , whereas the atomic transitions are damped by spontaneous emission to the modes other than the cavity mode at the rates @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively . in a frame rotating at the frequency @xmath9 ,",
    "the master equation of the density operator @xmath19 of the overall system ( the atom and the cavity field ) is of the form @xmath20+{\\cal l}_{a}{\\rho_{t}}+{\\cal l}_{c}{\\rho_{t } } , \\label{e1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the unperturbed hamiltonian of the coherently driven and weakly probed atom , @xmath22 is the hamiltonian of the cavity field , @xmath23 is the interaction hamiltonian of the cavity field with the atomic transitions , and @xmath24 are dissipative terms describing the damping of the atomic transitions by spontaneous emission and of the field by cavity decay .    here , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the annihilation and creation operators for the cavity field , @xmath27 are the atomic operators , @xmath28 is the frequency difference between the atomic transitions , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the detunings of the atomic frequency @xmath32 , the probe beam frequency  @xmath10 and the cavity frequency @xmath6 from the driving laser frequency @xmath9 .",
    "the parameters , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the ( real ) rabi frequencies of the driving laser field of amplitude @xmath35 and of the probe beam of amplitude @xmath36 .    in writing the master equation ( [ e1 ] ) , we have assumed that the atomic dipole moments are not orthogonal to each other , which results in the cross damping terms between the atomic transitions .",
    "these terms lead to quantum interference between the two transitions and are determined by the so - called cross damping parameter @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the angle between @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "when the dipole moments are parallel ( @xmath38 = 0 ) , the cross damping parameter is maximal with @xmath39 , whilst  @xmath40 when the dipole moments are perpendicular  @xcite . quantum interference has been studied intensively over years and has revealed new phenomena of both conceptual and practical importance .",
    "it has been shown that interference between atomic transitions induced by external fields or by spontaneously created atomic coherence can lead to novel phenomena such as electromagnetically induced transparency , lasing without inversion , enhanced index of refraction and also nonlinear processes such as enhanced the kerr nonlinearities .",
    "however , most of the predicted quantum interference effects have so far eluded observation , as it is very unlikely to find isolated atoms with two non - orthogonal dipole moments and states close in energy .",
    "therefore , we propose an alternative scheme where one can engineer coherence between atomic transitions with perpendicular dipole moments by coupling the transitions to a single - mode cavity field .",
    "as we shall see , crucial for the creation of the coherence is to couple the cavity mode simultaneously to both of the atomic transitions . in practice",
    ", it can be easily achieved by setting a cavity - field polarization making , for example , an angle @xmath41 with the direction of the atomic dipole moment @xmath4 and that simultaneously forms the angle @xmath42 with the dipole moment @xmath5 .",
    "the master equation ( [ e1 ] ) we have started with is written in the basis of the atomic states . since the atomic transition @xmath43",
    "is driven by a strong laser field , it prompts us to introduce dressed states which provide a good approach for studying the problem .",
    "the dressed states are eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath44 and are defined by the eigenvalue equation @xmath45 whose the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenstates , in the limit of a weak probe beam  @xmath46 , are @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the detuned rabi frequency of the driving field .",
    "we now introduce the interaction between the dressed atom and the cavity field and work in the bad cavity limit  @xcite , in which the cavity decay dominates over the coupling strengths @xmath50 and the atomic decay rates @xmath17 and @xmath18 , i.e. @xmath51 such a feature implies that the cavity mode response to the standard vacuum reservoir is much faster than that produced by its interaction with the atom . in other words , the cavity field forms a finite bandwidth ( markovian ) vacuum reservoir .",
    "working in the bad cavity limit , we can adiabatically eliminate the cavity variables .",
    "this yields a master equation where the damping terms have a structure dependent on the difference between the cavity field and the dressed - atom transition frequencies .",
    "details of the adiabatic approximation have been presented in ref .",

    "the parameters @xmath66 are quantum interference terms . they contain contributions of both , spontaneously generated and cavity effects , which clearly illustrate an analogy between the cavity engineered and the spontaneously induced coherence  @xcite .",

    "thus , in the system considered here , both the purcell and the cavity - induced quantum interference effects play an important role in the dynamics and properties of the system .    one can notice from ( [ e11])@xmath59([e15 ] ) that the coefficients in the differential equations are dependent on time .",
    "in fact , there is no reference frame in which the coefficients would be time independent .",

    "our purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that the combined effect of the purcell and the cavity - induced quantum interference phenomena can create giant linear and nonlinear susceptibilities in the three - level system .",
    "note that the cavity - induced quantum interference effects are more flexible to the parameters than those induced by the spontaneously generated coherence .",
    "the latter depend solely on the angle between the dipole moments of the two atomic transitions .",
    "the former depend on the rabi frequency of the driving field , damping rates of the atomic transitions , and the detunings of the fields from their resonances .",
    "this makes the cavity system more practical for creation of quantum interference effects than that induced by spontaneously created coherence .",
    "it is well known that the response of the atomic medium to the probe field is governed by its polarization @xmath70 , which can be expressed in terms of the complex susceptibility @xmath71 or related to the elements of the density matrix of the system as @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the number density of the atoms , and @xmath74 is the atomic coherence on the probed transition .",
    "the task then is to determine the atomic coherence @xmath75 , or equivalently @xmath76 and @xmath77 , which could be found by solving the set of equations  ( [ e11])@xmath59([e15 ] ) . in the stationary limit @xmath78",
    ", we may set all of the derivatives to zero and obtain a set of algebraic equations for the density matrix elements .",

    ", we employ the floquet method by expressing the density matrix elements as fourier series in terms of amplitudes that oscillate at the probe detuning and its harmonics .",
    "as we are interested in the response of the system to a weak probe field , we also make an expansion of the density matrix elements in terms of the powers of the probe field .",
    "these two decompositions combined together are given by the relation  @xcite @xmath80 where the expansion in the powers of @xmath81 is given in terms of a dimensionless parameter  @xmath82 that can take on values ranging continuously from zero ( no perturbation ) to one ( the full perturbation ) .",

    "it follows from the explicit solutions ( [ e25 ] ) and ( [ e26 ] ) that the magnitudes of the harmonics are proportional to @xmath98 , which ensures that their magnitudes are small even if the normalized susceptibilities @xmath99 and @xmath100 are large , since the probe beam strength is considered here to be weak , @xmath46 .",
    "this justifies the power expansion  ( [ e21 ] ) .",

    "we see that the susceptibilities exhibit resonance structures in the vicinity of the frequency @xmath117 . as we have already mentioned , at this frequency the quantum interference is maximal .",
    "the nonlinear ( kerr ) susceptibility is enhanced , but at the same time the linear and nonlinear absorptions are large . even at the frequency where the nonlinear absorption , im@xmath87 , vanishes ,",
    "the linear absorption im@xmath86 is large with the magnitude comparable to the magnitude of the kerr nonlinearity .",
    "this is not desirable for a practical application since the probe beam could be completely absorbed over a short distant of propagation inside the atomic medium .",

    "a close inspection of the analytical expressions ( [ e25 ] ) and ( [ e26 ] ) shows that the absorption rate of the probe beam depends on the difference @xmath118 between the populations of the lower and upper levels of the probe transition which , on the other hand , depends on the detuning @xmath60 .",
    "thus , we expect that the transparency of the propagation of the probe beam could be improved by applying the purcell effect , i.e. by varying the detuning @xmath60 to match the cavity frequency with the frequency of one of the rabi sidebands of the driven transition .    parts ( b ) and ( c ) of the figure show how the susceptibilities are modified when the cavity detuning @xmath60 is varied .",
