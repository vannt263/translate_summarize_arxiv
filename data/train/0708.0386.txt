    "recent years have seen a surge of interest in wireless networks . unlike the traditional point - to - point communication ,",
    "elementary modes of cooperation such as relaying are needed to improve both the throughput and reliability in a wireless network .",
    "although capacity of a relay channel  @xcite is still unknown in general , considerable progress has been made on several aspects , including some achievable capacity results  @xcite and capacity scaling laws of large networks  @xcite . in parallel , research on the cooperative diversity  @xcite , where the relays help the source exploit the spatial diversity of a slow fading channel in a distributed fashion , has attracted significant attention  @xcite .    in small relay networks where the source signal can reach the destination terminal via a direct link ,",
    "many results have been known in both the channel capacity  @xcite and the cooperative diversity .",
    "the capacity results are mostly based on the decode - and - forward  ( df ) and the compress - and - forward  ( cf ) strategies .",
    "the amplify - and - forward  ( af ) scheme , however , is rarely considered in this scenario due to the noise accumulation at the relays . on the other hand ,",
    "the af scheme is widely used for cooperative diversity .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the af scheme is as good as the df scheme at high snr as far as the diversity is concerned .",
    "furthermore , it is pointed out in @xcite that not needing to decode the source signal makes the relays more capable of protecting the source signal in some cases . the cf scheme , which works with perfect global channel state information  ( csi ) , is usually excluded in the cooperative diversity scenario for practical considerations . in larger relay networks , where direct source - destination links are generally absent",
    ", substantial results on the capacity scaling laws have been obtained in the large network size regime  @xcite . however ,",
    "much less is known about the cooperative diversity than in the case of small networks .",
    "this paper analyzes the cooperative diversity in relay networks with a single multi - antenna source - destination terminal pair .",
    "the source signal arrives at the destination via a sequence of @xmath0 hops through @xmath1 layers of relays .",
    "similar channel setting with a single layer has been studied in @xcite in different contexts . using large random matrix theory ,",
    "the ergodic capacity results of some particular relaying schemes have been established for large networks  @xcite .",
    "recently , the study has been extended to the case with multiple layers of relays  @xcite and the case with multiple source - destination pairs  @xcite .",
    "cooperative diversity in this setting was first studied in @xcite for the single - antenna case then in @xcite for the multi - antenna case , with distributed space - time coding .",
    "all the mentioned works assume linear processing at the relays and the df scheme is not considered . actually , one can figure out immediately that the df scheme is not suitable for the multi - antenna setting due to the suboptimality in terms of degrees of freedom .",
    "requiring the relays to decode the source signal restricts the achievable degrees of freedom .",
    "this is one of the fundamental differences between the large networks and small networks  : the degrees of freedom of the latter are determined by the source - destination link and not by the relaying strategy .    in this work ,",
    "we suppose that the network size is arbitrary  ( but fixed ) and the signal - to - noise ratio  ( snr ) is large . the multihop channel is investigated in terms of the diversity - multiplexing tradeoff  ( dmt ) .",
    "the dmt was introduced in  @xcite for the point - to - point multi - antenna  ( mimo ) channels to capture the fundamental tradeoff between the throughput and reliability in a slow fading channel at high snr .",
    "it was then extensively used in multiuser channels such as the multiple access channels  @xcite and the relay channels  @xcite as performance measure and design criterion of different schemes .",
    "our main contributions are summarized in the following paragraphs .",
    "first , we use the information theoretic cut - set bound  @xcite to derive an upper bound on the dmt of any relaying strategy . in the clustered case where the relays in the same layer can fully cooperate ,",
    "this bound is shown to be tight .",
    "an optimal scheme is the cooperative df scheme , where the clustered relays perform joint decoding and joint re - encoding .    while the clustered channel is equivalent to a series - channel and does not feature the distributed nature of wireless networks , the non - clustered case is studied as the main focus of the paper .",
    "since no within - layer cooperation is considered , linear processing at the relays is assumed .",
    "we start by the af strategy , which seems to be the natural first choice as a linear relaying scheme .",
    "we show that the af scheme is , in the dmt sense , equivalent to the rayleigh product  ( rp ) channel , a point - to - point channel whose channel matrix is defined by a product of @xmath0 gaussian matrices .",
    "that being said , we examine the rp channel in great detail .",
    "it turns out that the dmt of a rp channel has a nice recursive structure and lends some intuitive insights into the typical outage events in such channels .",
    "the study of the rp channel leads directly to an exact dmt characterization for the af scheme in multihop channels of arbitrary size .",
    "the closed - form dmt provides simple guidelines on how to efficiently use the available relays with the af scheme .",
    "one such example is how to reduce the number of relays while keeping the same diversity .",
    "while the maximum multiplexing gain is achieved , the achievable diversity gain of the af scheme can be far from maximum diversity gain suggested by the cut - set bound .",
    "specifically , the dmt of the af scheme is limited by a virtual `` bottleneck '' channel .",
    "the following question is then raised  : is the dmt cut - set bound tight in the non - clustered case ?",
    "the question is partially answered in this work  : there exists a scheme that achieves both extremes of the cut - set bound , that is , the maximum diversity extreme and maximum multiplexing extreme . in order to achieve the maximum diversity gain ,",
    "the key is space - time relay processing . noting that the af scheme is space - only",
    ", we incorporate the temporal processing into the af scheme . the first scheme that we propose",
    "parallel af _ scheme . by partitioning the multihop channel into @xmath2 `` af paths '' , we create a set of @xmath2 parallel sub - channels in the time domain .",
    "a packet that goes through the parallel channel attains an improved diversity if the partition is properly designed .",
    "it is shown that there is at least one partition such that the maximum diversity is achieved .",
    "however , the parallel af scheme does not have the maximum multiplexing gain in general , since the achievable degrees of freedom by the scheme are restricted by those of the individual af paths .",
    "in most cases , the af paths are not as `` wide '' as the original channel in terms of the degrees of freedom . in order to overcome the loss of degrees of freedom , we linearly transform the set of parallel af channels into another set in which each sub - channel has the same degrees of freedom as the multihop channel . in the new parallel channel ,",
    "each relay only need to flip the received signal in a pre - assigned mode , hence the name _ flip - and - forward _  ( ff ) .",
    "it is shown that the ff scheme achieves both the maximum diversity and multiplexing gains .",
    "furthermore , the dmt of the ff scheme is lower - bounded by that of the af scheme .    using the results obtained in the non - clustered case , we revisit the clustered case by pointing out that the cooperative df operation might not be needed in all clusters to get the maximum diversity .",
    "we also indicate that cross - antenna linear processing in each cluster helps to improve the dmt only when both transmitter csi and receiver csi are known to the relays .",
    "finally , coding schemes are proposed for all the studied relaying strategies . in the clustered case ,",
    "a series of perfect space - time block codes  ( stbcs )  @xcite with appropriate rates and dimensions are used at the source and each relay cluster that performs the cooperative df operation . in the non - clustered case ,",
    "construction of perfect stbcs for general parallel mimo channels is first provided .",
    "the constructed codes can be applied directly to the parallel af scheme and the ff scheme . all",
    "suggested coding schemes achieve the dmt despite of the fading statistics and are thus approximately universal  @xcite .    regarding the notations , we use boldface lower case letters @xmath3 to denote vectors , boldface capital letters @xmath4 to denote matrices .",

    "most detailed proofs are deferred to the appendices .",
    "the considered @xmath0-hop relay channel model is composed of one source  ( layer  @xmath41 ) , one destination  ( layer  @xmath0 ) , and @xmath1 layers of relays  ( layer  @xmath42 to layer  @xmath1 ) . each terminal is equipped with multiple antennas . the total number of antennas in layer  @xmath43 is denoted by @xmath44 . for convenience , we define @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "we assume that the source signal arrives at the destination via a sequence of @xmath0 hops through the @xmath1 layers and that terminals in layer  @xmath43 can only receive the signal from layer  @xmath48 . the fading sub - channel between layer  @xmath48 and layer  @xmath43 is denoted by the matrix @xmath49 .",

    "since we consider the non - ergodic case where the coherence time interval @xmath50 is large enough , we drop the time index @xmath55 hereafter .",
    "it is assumed that all relays work in full - duplex mode and the transmission is subject to the short - term power constraint @xmath56with @xmath57 being the average transmitted snr per layer .",
    "all terminals are supposed to have perfect channel state information at the receiver and no csi at the transmitter . from now on",
    ", we denote the channel as a @xmath58 multihop channel .",
    "slow fading channels are outage - limited , i.e. , there is an _ outage probability _ @xmath59 that the channel can not support a target data rate of @xmath60 bits per channel use at signal - to - noise ratio @xmath57 . in the high snr regime",
    ", this fundamental interplay between throughput and reliability is characterized by the diversity - multiplexing tradeoff  @xcite .",
    "the _ multiplexing gain _ @xmath61 and _ diversity gain _ @xmath62 of a fading channel are defined by @xmath63 a more compact form is @xmath64    note that in the definition we use the outage probability instead of the error probability , since it is shown in @xcite that the error probability of any particular coding scheme with maximum likelihood  ( ml ) decoding is dominated by the outage probability at high snr and that the thus defined dmt is the best that one can achieve with any coding scheme . in the rayleigh mimo channel , the dmt has the following closed form .",
    "[ lemma : dmt - rayleigh ] the dmt of a @xmath65 rayleigh channel is a piecewise - linear function connecting the points  @xmath66 , @xmath67 , where @xmath68    in the following , we will use the dmt as our performance measure . for convenience of presentation , we provide the following definition .",
    "two channels are said to be _ dmt - equivalent _ or _ equivalent _ if they have the same dmt .      before studying any specific relaying strategy",
    ", we establish an upper bound on the dmt of the multihop system as a benchmark .",
    "[ prop : dmt - ub ] for any relaying strategy @xmath69 , we have @xmath70 with @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the dmt of the point - to - point channel between layer  @xmath48 and layer  @xmath43 . in particular , by defining the maximum diversity gain and multiplexing gain as @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively , we have @xmath75    from the information theoretic cut - set bound  @xcite , the mutual information between the source and the destination satisfies @xmath76 for any relaying strategy @xmath69 .",
    "thus , the outage probability using a relaying scheme @xmath69 is @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the outage probability of the @xmath43th sub - channel . from ( [ eq : dmt - compact ] ) and ( [ eq : tmp999 ] ) , we prove ( [ eq : dmt - ub ] ) . finally , ( [ eq : dmax ] ) and ( [ eq : rmax ] ) are from the direct application of lemma  [ lemma : dmt - rayleigh ] .",
    "if we assume that the relays within the same layer are clustered , i.e. , they can perform joint decoding and joint re - coding operations , then each layer can act as a virtual multi - antenna terminal .",
    "this could happen either when the relays are controlled by a central unit via wired links or when they are close enough to each other to exchange information perfectly . in this case",
    ", the relay channel model is equivalent to a serial concatenation of @xmath0 independent mimo channels",
    ". let us consider the following cooperative decode - and - forward scheme .",
    "each layer tries to cooperatively decode the received signal .",
    "when a successful decoding is assumed , the embedded message is re - encoded and then forwarded to the next layer .",
    "we can show that this simple scheme is dmt optimal .",
    "[ prop : df ] when the relays are clustered , the cooperative df scheme achieves the dmt cut - set bound @xmath79 defined in ( [ eq : dmt - ub ] ) .    to show the achievability , note that the cooperative df scheme being in outage implies the outage of at least one of the sub - channels . by the union",

    "hence , the dmt cut - set bound is tight in the clustered case .",
    "however , relays in wireless networks are not clustered in general . in fact , one of the important and interesting attributes of wireless networks is the distributed nature . in the following two sections ,",
    "we will concentrate on the non - clustered case and analyze the achievable dmt .",
    "in this section , we consider the non - clustered case , where the relays work in a distributed manner and no within - layer communication is allowed . in this case , applying the df scheme at each individual relay might incur loss of degrees of freedom . to see this ,",
    "take the single - layer channel as an example . in the best case where all the relays succeed in decoding ,",
    "they transmit the message using a pre - assigned codebook .",
    "this scheme transforms the relays - destination channel into a @xmath82 virtual mimo channel . before this",
    "could possibly happen , however , the success decoding at the relays must be guaranteed with high probability .",
    "this constraint imposes that the degrees of freedom in this scheme must not be larger than @xmath83 with @xmath84 being the number of antennas at the @xmath85th relay .",
    "while this scheme achieves the maximum multiplexing gain in the single - antenna case , it could fail in the multi - antenna case .    since we do not know how to cooperate efficiently in this case , we start by the most obvious and naivest relaying scheme  : the amplify - and - forward scheme .",
    "this scheme in the considered setting has been studied in @xcite for the capacity scaling laws , and in @xcite for the dmt .",
    "it is worth noting that , in @xcite , a lower bound on the dmt of the af scheme in a symmetric network  ( @xmath86 , @xmath87 ) was obtained , while our work derives the exact dmt for a network of arbitrary dimension with a different approach .      in the considered af scheme",
    ", each antenna node normalizes the received signal to the same power level and then retransmits it .",
    "this linear operation can be expressed as @xmath88where , by the power constraint ( [ eq : power - constraint ] ) , @xmath89 the scaling matrix @xmath90 is diagonal due to the antenna - wise nature of the relaying scheme , with the normalization factors in ( [ eq : md ] ) by @xmath42 s . ]",

    "since it can be shown that @xmath99 , @xmath100 can be neglected in the dmt analysis and the af channel is equivalent to the mimo channel defined by the following matrix @xmath101the rest of the section is devoted to the dmt analysis of this channel .",

    "@xmath58 is called the _ dimension _ of the channel and @xmath0 is called the _ length _ of the channel .",

    "the comparison shows that the _ bottleneck _ of the channel is always one of the hops  ( inter - layer sub - channels ) , while the bottleneck of the af scheme is the virtual @xmath166 channel that does not correspond to any physical sub - channel in most cases .",

    "this condition is very stringent .",
    "it means that the two layers with minimum numbers of antennas must stand one next to the other and that the other layers must have a large number of antennas .",
    "moreover , note that the af scheme achieving the maximum diversity does not necessarily mean that it achieves @xmath79 for all @xmath61 .      in order to achieve the diversity upper bound ,",
    "intuitively , one should assure that the end - to - end channel is good if each sub - channel is good .",
    "however , this property does not hold for the af scheme that suffers from the _ mismatch _ of adjacent sub - channels .",
    "a concrete example is as follows .    in the symmetric two - hop channel with @xmath199  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ex ] ) , the diversity order of the af scheme is @xmath200 while the upper bound is @xmath201 .",
    "note that the af channel is in outage if the product channel @xmath202 is bad , i.e. , all the singular values of @xmath202 are close to zero .",

    "as we know , the first probability decays with @xmath57 as @xmath205 . to find out the snr exponent of the second probability , we assume without loss of generality that the vector @xmath206 is strong enough  ( since @xmath204 is not bad ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ex_canon ] .",
    "now , we apply an orthogonal basis change from the canonical basis to @xmath207 and get the equivalent channel in fig .  [",

    "the spatial correlation of the codewords is due to the fact that the received signal at different relays is from the same source . the temporal correlation , on the other hand",

    "with receiver csi at the relays , let us consider the following project - and - forward  ( pf ) scheme . at layer  @xmath43 ,",

    "the spirit of the pf scheme is not to use more antennas than necessary to forward the signal .",
    "since the useful signal lies only in the @xmath346-dimensional signal subspace , the projection of the received signal provides sufficient statistics and reduces the noise power by a factor @xmath357 . in this case , only @xmath346 antennas are needed to forward the projected signal .",

    "this is because in the pf case , less relay antennas are used than in the af case .",
    "since the power of independent noises from different transmit antennas add up at the receiver side , the accumulated noise in the af case `` enjoys ''",
    "a larger `` transmit diversity order '' than in the pf case .    on the other hand , if we could have receiver _ and",
    "_ transmitter csi at the clusters , the dmt could be improved as shown by the following example .",
    "[ ex : mf ] for a @xmath360 clustered multihop channel , the dmt cut - set bound can be achieved by linear processing within clusters if both transmitter and receiver csi are available at each cluster .",

    "we can further reduce the number of transmit antennas to @xmath27 to get a @xmath453 channel . unlike the reduction of relay antennas , the reduction of transmit antennas does not provide any gain because it does not impact the relayed noise .",
    "in contrast , it degrades the performance since the first hop @xmath454 is faded more seriously than the original first hop @xmath455 .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath453 channel is still better than the @xmath451 channel and is only @xmath456 db from the @xmath452 channel .",
    "the coded performance of the @xmath451 channel is then studied  fig .  [",

    "hence , the ff scheme also achieves the maximum diversity .",
    "the key point is shown in the following .",
    "first , let us divide the set of indices @xmath758 into @xmath759 groups , each one comprising exactly @xmath760 integers @xmath761 such that @xmath762 and @xmath763 varies from @xmath42 to @xmath760 .",
    "then , we partition the set @xmath270 according to the partition of the indices described above .",
    "hence , the matrices in the same group can be rewritten as @xmath764 with @xmath210 being some matrix .",
    "we have @xmath765 where @xmath766 is composed of @xmath767 blocks of matrices with the @xmath768-th block being @xmath769 if @xmath770 and @xmath771 otherwise .",

    "finally , we obtain @xmath747 and the total transformation is invertible , constant and linear .",
    "note that the parallel channel of the ff scheme is in outage for a target rate @xmath777 implies that at least one of the sub - channels is in outage for a target rate @xmath778 .",
    "therefore , one can show that @xmath779 , from which @xmath780 .",

    "we have thus @xmath805 .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the achievability holds for any fading statistics .",
    "thus , the code is approximately universal .",

    "although this construction is simple and suitable for both symmetric and asymmetric channels , the main drawback is that the coding delay is roughly @xmath2 times larger than the parallel nvd code constructed in section  [ sec : paranvd ] .",
