    "replacing an element with one of its isotopes is one of the most useful tools to study chemical mechanisms and equilibria . since isotopes differ only by the number of neutrons , the potential energy surface on which they evolve , which arises from the electron - proton interactions , is unchanged .",
    "if the nuclei behaved as classical particles , moving on the born - oppenheimer potential energy surface , the thermodynamic properties of systems containing different isotopes would be identical .",
    "however , light nuclei exhibit nuclear quantum effects such as zero - point energy and tunnelling , which are more pronounced for lighter isotopes .",
    "as such , isotope effects provide an experimental window through which the influence of nuclear quantum effects can be probed .",
    "accurate and efficient simulations of isotope effects would enable the investigation of many important processes such as acid - base chemistry , shifts in phase boundaries , geological fractionation ratios and equilibrium constants of chemical reactions @xcite .",
    "in addition , the shift in the free energy barrier along a particular reaction coordinate can be used to obtain the change in the rate of a chemical reaction via a quantum transition state theory @xcite or , when combined with a dynamics scheme such as centroid molecular dynamics or ring polymer molecular dynamics , an approximation to the full dynamical rate constant @xcite .",
    "isotope effects in these processes show a range of interesting behaviors .",
    "for example recent work on water and other hydrogen - bonded systems have demonstrated that quantum mechanical effects can act to strengthen short hydrogen bonds or to weaken long ones @xcite .",
    "this concept of `` competing quantum effects '' has recently been shown to explain the inversion in the atmospherically important fractionation of hydrogen and deuterium between the liquid and vapor phases of water where at ambient temperatures d is favored in the liquid whereas at higher temperatures d is favored in the vapor @xcite . accurately describing the cancellation between the quantum effects in water",
    "requires the inclusion of anharmonic terms in the potential and therefore conclusions drawn from simple harmonic approximations can be misleading .",
    "in addition the subtle nature of this cancellation means that fractionation ratios can be used as a sensitive test of a potential energy surface s ability to accurately predict quantum effects .",
    "modelling isotope effects requires the calculation of the free energy change upon isotope substitution . for some systems such as solids and simple molecular gases a reasonable approximation of the isotope effect can be gained from either a harmonic approximation or @xmath2 perturbation @xcite .",
    "however for liquids , which contain many anharmonic modes , or when treating more strongly quantum mechanical atoms such as h and d , these approximations can be inaccurate or inefficient @xcite .",
    "the exact calculation of isotope exchange free energies can be achieved by using the imaginary time path integral formalism of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "this formalism exploits the isomorphism between a quantum mechanical system and a classical system in an extended `` ring polymer '' phase space . as such",
    "it can be applied to any system for which a classical simulation can be performed , albeit traditionally with a significant computational overhead .",
    "a series of recent developments have dramatically decreased the computational cost of path integral simulations .",
    "these have taken the form of the introduction of efficient integrators and thermostatting schemes to address non - ergodicity @xcite .",
    "in addition , methods have been developed to reduce the number of force evaluations or points on the imaginary time path @xcite .",
    "these developments along with improvements in the ability to perform computationally efficient _ ab initio _ calculations make on - the - fly first principles path integral molecular dynamics a feasible proposition @xcite .",
    "such a combination is natural , since _ ab initio _",
    "calculations attempt to reproduce the exact born - oppenheimer potential energy surface . whereas nuclear quantum effects are often implicitly accounted for by empirical potential energy surfaces , which are typically parameterized to reproduce experimental properties , they are completely absent in _ ab initio _ calculations unless they are treated explicitly .    in this work",
    "we introduce a series of developments to allow the extraction of free energy changes upon isotope substitution from path integral simulations .",
    "firstly , we show how the free energy change can be computed efficiently by performing a physically motivated transformation of the thermodynamic integration variables .",
    "secondly , we address the failures of harmonic approximations when applied to liquids and other systems with anharmonic degrees of freedom in terms of both accuracy and , more remarkably , efficiency when compared to path integral simulations .",
    "thirdly , we introduce two path integral estimators , based on a free energy perturbation approach , that offer desirable features such as the ability to extract isotope free energy changes from a single path integral trajectory of the most abundant isotope .",
    "we benchmark these methods against the previously introduced thermodynamic integration approach @xcite using h / d substitution in liquid water as a prototypical model of a hydrogen bonded system . in doing so",
    ", we demonstrate the strengths and pitfalls which each possess , and identify which approach may be most advantageous for a given application .",
    "let us consider the thermodynamics of substituting an atom @xmath3 of mass @xmath4 in a system @xmath5 with a different isotope of the same element , having mass @xmath6 .",
    "more specifically , we will consider the process of taking an atom in a phase , molecule or compound , which we will label as @xmath7 , and exchanging it with an atom of the other isotope taken from a reservoir of non - interacting atoms , which we will label @xmath8 : @xmath9 the equilibrium is controlled by the free energy change corresponding to this process , @xmath10 . here",
    "we will consider the transformation to be performed at constant volume , but the extension to constant pressure is straightforward .",
    "one can compute @xmath10 by thermodynamic integration , by first writing out the quantum mechanical free energy at inverse temperature @xmath11 for the system @xmath5 containing an isotope of mass @xmath12 @xmath13,\\ ] ] and then differentiating with respect to mass , which yields an expression containing the expectation value of the quantum kinetic energy of the system : @xmath14 the thermodynamic integration for the free atoms is straightforward , and one is left with an expression for the free energy difference that reads @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the dimensionality of the problem and @xmath17 is the expectation value of the kinetic energy of atom @xmath3 with mass @xmath12 in the system @xmath5 .",
    "one observation that is immediately clear from this result is that if the atom behaved classically , its average kinetic energy would yield the classical equipartition value of @xmath18 per degree of freedom and the free energy difference in eq .",
    "would amount to zero . in order to compute @xmath10",
    "it is therefore necessary to evaluate the expectation value of the kinetic energy in a way that takes into account the quantum mechanical nature of the atoms .",
    "one can in practice discretize the integral in eq .   and",
    "compute the integrand for a few values of the isotope mass , @xmath12 . in previous studies a linear discretization in the isotope mass @xmath12 has been used @xcite .",
    "however , one can accelerate the convergence considerably by performing a change of variables that takes into account the physical nature of the problem . making such a change of variables acts to smooth the integrand so that a good approximation can be obtained with a very small number of integration points .",
    "if the mass - dependence of @xmath19 were known , one could make the integrand @xmath20 constant by performing the transformation @xmath21 where @xmath22 satisfies the differential equation @xmath23 where c is any constant .",
    "clearly @xmath19 is not known exactly beforehand , so one can not in practice solve eq .  .",
    "however , one can use physical intuition to make assumptions on the form of @xmath19 and derive a transformation which `` flattens '' the integral .",
    "a particularly useful limit for condensed phase systems is the limit where the problem is nearly harmonic and strongly quantized . in that case",
    "it can be shown that @xmath24 where the @xmath25 s are the spring constants of the various normal modes . with this assumption one",
    "obtains @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is an integration constant . in practice , by choosing @xmath28 and @xmath29 , the desired change of variable is simply @xmath30 .",
    ".   is therefore transformed into @xmath31 figure  [ fig : th - int ] shows the integrand of eqs .   and   for the h / d substitution in liquid water . using the coordinate transformation in eq .",
    "makes the integrand nearly constant , which simplifies greatly the integration . using eq .",
    ", one would obtain @xmath32  mev when computing six integration points , and @xmath33  mev where only the two extrema are used . from eq .",
    "one would instead obtain the fully converged value @xmath34  mev when using six points , and @xmath35  mev when using only two .",
    "panel ( a ) shows the integrand of eq .",
    ", as computed for a @xmath36 pimd simulation of liquid water with one hydrogen atom being transformed into deuterium .",
    "panel ( b ) shows that the integrand becomes nearly constant when a transformed integration variable is used , as in eq .  .",
    "lines are just guides for the eye , and statistical error bars are reported for each point .",
    "the dashed line shows the estimate from the two end points .",
    "note the difference in the scale : in panel ( a ) the integrand varies by a factor of 2 , whereas in panel ( b ) it varies by less than 3% . ]      for solids and gases nuclear quantum effects are usually accounted for using the harmonic approximation @xcite . within this approximation",
    ", the quantum kinetic energy can be estimated by first computing the normal mode frequencies @xmath37 and the corresponding normalized eigenvectors @xmath38 and then evaluating the kinetic energy for a given atom @xmath39 using @xcite @xmath40 here @xmath41 indicates the component of the eigenvector @xmath38 corresponding to atom @xmath39 in the cartesian direction @xmath42 . in solids , one would need to integrate over the brillouin zone . for gas - phase molecules",
    "one can include the ( classical ) contributions from rotations and translations by also summing over the zero - frequency eigenvalues of the dynamical matrix . including quantized rotations adds considerable additional complexity but is only necessary at very low temperatures .    for solids and simple gas - phase molecules",
    "this is often a good approximation which can be computed inexpensively .",
    "however , the cost of computing the hessian grows rapidly with the number of atoms .",
    "moreover , in systems such as liquids that contain many anharmonic modes it makes little sense to compute the hessian for finite - temperature configurations @xcite .",
    "however , one can compute the vibrational density of states for a given atom from the fourier transform of the velocity - velocity correlation function , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the velocity of atom @xmath39 .",
    "an approximation to the quantum kinetic energy can then be computed by normalizing @xmath45 such that @xmath46 and evaluating @xcite @xmath47 figure  [ fig : harmonic ] contrasts the values of the integrand that enter eq .",
    "for both liquid water and water vapor at @xmath48  k , as computed exactly by direct substitution ( see sec .",
    "[ sub : direct ] ) and by quasi - harmonic analysis ( eq .   for the vapor and eq .   for the liquid ) . for each phase ,",
    "the harmonic approximation is close to the corresponding exact path integral result .",
    "there are however two important observations to be made .",
    "the figure shows the integrand of the transformed thermodynamic integration   as a function of the mass of the isotope .",
    "the results from fully - converged pimd ( @xmath36 , blue lines ) are compared with those from a harmonic / quasi - harmonic approximation ( red lines ) .",
    "curves are shown for both liquid water ( full lines ) and an isolated molecule in the gas phase ( dashed lines ) .",
    "the harmonic approximation for the gas phase is based on static calculations and therefore has no error bars . for all other calculations lines",
    "are just guides for the eye , and statistical error bars are reported for each data point . ]",
    "firstly , one is generally interested in computing _ differences _ between isotope - substitution free energies such as isotopic fractionation ratios or acidity shifts , which are highly sensitive to subtle anharmonic effects .",
    "for instance the geochemically important process of isotopic fractionation between liquid water and its vapor corresponds to the free energy change associated with the process @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes the liquid phase , and @xmath51 denotes the vapor phase .",
    "typically this is expressed as a fractionation ratio , @xmath52 using the data in fig .  [ fig : harmonic ] to compute the fractionation ratio the quasi - harmonic approximation yields a value of @xmath53 compared to the exact path integral result of @xmath54 .",
    "a harmonic approximation would therefore substantially overpredict the amount to which h and d separate in the atmosphere .    secondly , although one might view the quasi - harmonic approximation in eq .   as a computationally inexpensive approach to obtain an estimate of the quantum kinetic energy of a liquid ,",
    "this is not the case .",
    "the reason for its inefficiency is that the kinetic energy is obtained from the integral of the fourier transform of the velocity autocorrelation function .",
    "hence any statistical noise in the velocity autocorrelation function must be very small to avoid the appearance of large statistical errors in the quantum kinetic energy .",
    "for example to obtain the exact results in fig .",
    "[ fig : harmonic ] we performed a @xmath36 bead path integral trajectory which in the most naive implementation is @xmath55 times more costly than a single classical simulation of the same length . despite the fact that we computed the quasi - harmonic estimate in eq .   from 64 independent classical trajectories of the same length",
    " which thereby required the same computational effort as the path integral simulation ",
    "the statistical error of the pimd results is 10 times smaller than that of the quasi - harmonic approximation . in other terms , for a given level of statistical accuracy , a quasi - harmonic approximation such as in eq .",
    "is 100 times more demanding than a fully converged pimd simulation , even if we considered a number of beads twice as large as what is generally deemed converged and we did not exploit the efficient estimators we introduce in section  [ sub : fep - estimators ] , ring - polymer contraction @xcite or the piglet method @xcite .    in summary , while harmonic approximations may be a viable way to crudely estimate the role of nuclear quantum effects and the change in isotope substitution free energies in the gas phase and in simple , harmonic solids by means of eq .",
    "they should be treated with caution in terms of both efficiency and accuracy for liquids and systems with anharmonicity .",
    "in particular whenever something as subtle as isotope fractionation ratios are required or whenever the system is strongly anharmonic , the path integral methods we discuss in the following section are not only more accurate , but paradoxically less computationally demanding than a quasi - harmonic approximation .      to move beyond the harmonic approximation to the kinetic energy in eq .   while including the quantum nature of the nuclei one can use the imaginary time path integral formulation of quantum mechanics .",
    "this approach allows one to exactly include the quantum nature of the nuclei for a system of @xmath56 distinguishable particles at a finite temperature . for simplicity we shall use a notation for a single particle of mass @xmath4 in one dimension , described by its position @xmath57 and momentum @xmath58 .",
    "the generalization to multiple degrees of freedom is routine and has been widely discussed elsewhere @xcite . for a system with a hamiltonian of the form @xmath59",
    ", one can show that the quantum mechanical partition function @xmath60 $ ] at inverse temperature @xmath11 is isomorphic to the classical partition function of an extended system  the so - called _ ring polymer _ : @xmath61 here @xmath62 is the ring polymer hamiltonian @xmath63 where cyclic boundary conditions @xmath64 are implied , and @xmath65 .",
    "equation   describes @xmath66 replicas ( beads ) of the physical system , where replicas with adjacent indices are connected by harmonic springs to form a closed loop . as @xmath67 the path integral partition function @xmath68 converges to the correct quantum mechanical one .",
    "the momenta in the partition function of eq .   simply provide a sampling tool and can be integrated out analytically .",
    "hence all the quantum mechanical information is encoded in the configurational part of @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , even a property which is directly related to the momentum such as the kinetic energy must be computed by means of a configurational average of an appropriate estimator . in what follows we will use @xmath69 to indicate the configurational average of the estimator @xmath70 over the canonical ensemble for a particle of mass @xmath4 , @xmath71 this phase - space average can be evaluated by generating a sequence of configurations consistent with the appropriate probability distribution , and averaging over the values of @xmath72 corresponding to the different configurations .",
    "this set of configurations can be generated for instance by means of a monte carlo procedure , or by molecular dynamics @xcite .    by differentiating the partition function with respect to @xmath11",
    ", one can derive the thermodynamic kinetic energy estimator , @xmath73 in practice however computing the kinetic energy from eq .",
    "is problematic , because the estimator @xmath74 exhibits a large variance that worryingly grows linearly with the number of beads , @xmath66 .",
    "hence the statistical error of a simulation of a given length grows as the number of beads is increased to reach convergence .",
    "it is however possible to derive a centroid virial estimator @xcite , @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the centroid coordinate .",
    "this estimator yields the same average value as that in eq .   but has a variance that does not grow with @xmath66 .      as shown in eq .",
    "in order to evaluate the free energy change induced by isotope substitution , one has to calculate the change in the quantum kinetic energy upon the change in mass of one of the atoms in the system .",
    "the most direct approach is to perform a series of independent simulations with different values of the isotope mass and compute @xmath77 for each . since in most cases",
    "one of the isotopes has very low natural abundance , this typically involves performing a simulation with a single particle of mass @xmath12 inside a large supercell containing several tens or hundreds of atoms of the naturally abundant isotope .",
    "this is far from ideal , because one has to perform multiple simulations , one for each value of @xmath12 , in order to evaluate the thermodynamic integration in eq .  , and because statistics are accumulated for just one atom out of the many present in the simulation .",
    "hence a highly appealing solution would be to compute @xmath78 from a single simulation of _ only _ the most abundant isotope by a free energy perturbation ( fep ) method .",
    "this approach involves evaluation of estimators that simultaneously compute the kinetic energy and correct the phase - space distribution to reproduce the statistics of the isotope - substituted system .",
    "these estimators can be obtained by writing the full expressions for the expectation values @xmath78 and @xmath79 as phase - space averages . by comparing the two expressions",

    "however , statistical re - weighting comes with its own set of problems which must be carefully scrutinized .",
    "the difference hamiltonian eq",
    ".   appears in the exponent of eq .  .",
    "if it exhibits large fluctuations the weights of different configurations will vary wildly and the average performed over many configurations will be dominated by a few outliers , resulting in very poor sampling efficiency .",
    "more quantitatively , recent work has shown that whenever one computes re - weighted averages of the form @xmath83 , the squared error in the mean for an average built out of @xmath84 un - correlated samples will be of the order of @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "hence the error grows _ exponentially _ with the variance of the difference hamiltonian , @xmath86 .",
    "in addition re - weighted averages are affected by a slowly - decreasing systematic error . for re - weighted sampling to be efficient",
    "it is therefore necessary for the fluctuations of the temperature - scaled difference hamiltonian to be small and certainly not much larger than one .    with this in mind eq .",
    "is worrisome in that it is closely reminiscent of the thermodynamic kinetic energy estimator in eq .   which is known to exhibit a variance which grows with the number of beads , @xmath66 .",
    "due to this similarity we will refer to the estimator in eq .   as the td - fep estimator .",
    "one may therefore wonder whether it is possible to derive an alternative expression which , just as the centroid virial kinetic energy estimator in eq .  , yields the same average with a variance which does not grow with @xmath66 . to this aim",
    ", we use a coordinate - scaling approach in the form of yamamoto  @xcite . in our case",
    ", the appropriate scaled coordinates are @xmath87 this scaling corresponds to a contraction / dilation of the ring polymer .",
    "starting from a configuration with a radius of gyration characteristic of the abundant isotope , it produces one that is more compatible with what would be expected for an isotope of mass @xmath12 . by performing such a change of variables in the configurational integral for @xmath88 , and then using manipulations analogous to those in ref .",

    "\\label{eq : sc - fep}\\ ] ]    again , the average is performed in the ensemble that contains only the majority isotope , but now the centroid virial estimator is evaluated at the scaled coordinates ( eq . ) and the temperature - scaled difference hamiltonian is @xmath90 unlike the td - fep estimator in eq .",
    ", it can be seen that the variance of @xmath91 does not grow with @xmath66 . due to the scaled coordinate transformation",
    "we will refer to this estimator as the sc - fep estimator .",
    "however , unlike the td - fep estimator which can be computed for an arbitrary mass ratio in a completely inexpensive way , the sc - fep estimator requires an additional @xmath66 energy and force evaluations for each mass ratio and tagged particle .",
    "such force evaluations can be made inexpensive if the potential consists only in a sum of pairwise or otherwise local contributions , because in that case only the interactions involving the tagged particle need to be updated .",
    "however , in other cases using the sc - fep estimator may entail a significant computational overhead due to the extra potential energy calculations .    because of the subtle issues connected with re - weighting methods , in order to assess the relative merits of these two fep estimators it is important to perform a careful quantitative analysis . in appendix  [",
    "sec : stats ] we examine the case of a harmonic potential , where such analysis can be performed analytically .",
    "let us consider here the resulting expressions for the fluctuations of the difference hamiltonian , under the further simplifying assumptions that the large-@xmath66 limit is being attained and that we are dealing with a strongly quantized normal mode having frequency @xmath92 ( i.e. @xmath93 ) .",
    "for the td - fep estimator we find that @xmath94 is proportional to @xmath66 , as one might have expected : @xmath95 in contrast , the difference hamiltonian for the sc - fep estimator yields a variance which does not grow with @xmath66 , @xmath96 as discussed earlier , re - weighting approaches are only reliable when @xmath97 @xcite .",
    "this imposes a limit on the range of values of the mass ratio , @xmath42 , for which the td - fep estimator can be used .",
    "the number of beads required to converge a path integral simulation depends on the maximum frequency in the system and a reasonable convergence criterion is @xmath98 @xcite . inserting this condition into   yields a constraint on the values of the mass ratio for which the td - fep estimator is reliable ,",
    "@xmath99 proceeding similiarly for the sc - fep estimator yields a range of acceptable mass ratios of , @xmath100 these analytic estimates allow us to predict how the two approaches might compare in a practical case .",
    "for example for liquid water at room temperature the highest frequency is the oh stretch which extends to frequencies around 3500 @xmath101 .",
    "this gives @xmath102 . inserting this into eqs .",
    "and yields acceptable mass ratios of @xmath103 and @xmath104 for the td - fep and sc - fep estimators respectively .",
    "hence the td - fep approach in eq .   would not even allow one to perform a fep that transforms @xmath105 into deuterium ( @xmath106 ) , whereas the sc - fep approach in eq .   would be reliable all the way to tritium ( @xmath107 ) . in the following section we assess the accuracy of these harmonic predictions as to the applicability of the fep estimators and",
    "contrast them with the direct substitution method for the calculation of free energy changes in liquid water .",
    "to assess the relative merits of the approaches introduced in the previous section we performed isotope substitution simulations in liquid water . despite its apparent simplicity liquid water provides a challenging test - bed since it contains a wide range of frequencies and exhibits a competition between two quantum effects , one of which acts to strengthen its hydrogen bonding network and one which weakens it @xcite .",
    "this competition is seen in a variety of other hydrogen bonded systems @xcite and arises from the anharmonicity along the hydrogen bond - covalent bond coordinate @xcite .",
    "as such water contains many of the features one may encounter in other liquids or hydrogen bonded systems and has an important but subtle anharmonic component which must be correctly captured in order to accurately compute the free energy change upon isotope substitution .",
    "the free energy change we will focus on is the isotopic fractionation of h and d between the liquid and the gas phase for water at room temperature defined in eq .   as well as the fractionation of @xmath0o and @xmath1o .",
    "the results are quoted as fractionation factors as defined in eq .   which correspond to the ratio of isotope in the liquid to that in the vapor .",
    "the fractionation of isotopes is a frequently used technique to understand processes as diverse as the water cycle in the earth s climate , biological function and the origins of the interstellar medium @xcite .    as can be seen from eqs .   and the liquid - vapor fractionation ratio probes the change in the quantum kinetic energy upon moving a water molecule from the liquid phase to the gas phase .",
    "an increase in kinetic energy occurs when a quantum particle is confined by the forces exerted on the particle by the surrounding molecules .",
    "computing fractionation ratios is particularly challenging , since their precise value depends on subtle cancellations of different quantum effects .",
    "as such , they could serve as a sensitive test of how well different potentials reproduce this delicate balance .",
    "we performed our simulations using the flexible simple point charge q - tip4p / f water model @xcite .",
    "this model was chosen as it has been shown to accurately predict the h / d fractionation between liquid water and its vapor @xcite as well as a variety of other properties of water such as its density maximum and melting point @xcite when used in pimd simulations .",

    "we will compare two approaches : an efficiently thermostatted implementation of pimd @xcite and the recently introduced piglet method @xcite .",
    "the difference in these approaches is in their convergence with respect to the number of beads employed . in conventional pimd @xcite in order to converge a simulation for a system whose fastest vibrational mode has a frequency @xmath92 , the number of beads , @xmath66 , must be two or more times the parameter @xmath108 . for water at room temperature typically @xmath109 yields results with an error of a few percent . in most simulations",
    "the computational effort is dominated by the calculation of the forces , and so the total cost of a conventional pimd simulation scales linearly with beads  hence making the pimd simulation @xmath110 times more expensive than a classical one .",

    "lines are just guides for the eye , and statistical error bars are smaller than the size of the points . ]",
    "recently introduced colored - noise langevin dynamics approaches can reduce the cost of path integral simulations by enforcing certain pre - determined bead - bead correlations to be exact in the harmonic limit  @xcite .",
    "this dramatically reduces the number of beads needed to converge many properties , even in anharmonic systems . of these colored - noise approaches the piglet method",
    "@xcite is particularly relevant to the present work since it was designed to ensure fast convergence of the quantum kinetic energy , @xmath88 which is all that is required to compute the free energy change by explicit isotope substitution .",
    "the fast convergence of the kinetic energy using piglet is demonstrated in figure  [ fig : p - converge]a . using pimd with @xmath109 yields an estimate of the kinetic energy with an error of about 2% .",
    "piglet yields results with similar accuracy to this using only 6 beads . figure  [ fig : p - converge]b shows the fractionation ratio evaluated from eq .  .",
    "this property is the small difference of two large quantities and is therefore very sensitive to errors in the description of anharmonicities , which is apparent in the very poor performance of the quasi - harmonic approximation ( see sec .",
    "[ sub : harm ] ) . nevertheless , piglet performs remarkably well : from 4 to 12 beads , the values of @xmath115 differ by less than 10% from the asymptotic value , an error which is much lower than the one stemming from the use of an empirical potential @xcite .",
    "however , even in the harmonic limit , the piglet approach does not enforce all the bead - bead correlations needed for the expectation values of the td - fep and sc - fep estimators in eq .",
    "and eq .  .",
    "therefore , there is no guarantee that piglet will converge much faster than conventional pimd when used together with one of the fep estimators .",
    "on the other hand , the earlier pi+gle colored noise approach @xcite was shown to enhance convergence of the kinetic energy even though it was not developed to enforce all the required correlations .",

    "the statistical uncertainty of a property computed out of a simulation of length @xmath116 decreases in proportion to @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the correlation time of that property .",
    "hence , for a given length of the simulation , observables with short correlation times will exhibit smaller statistical error . in this regard the pile - g thermostat we used for pimd calculations and piglet are both very efficient .",

    "we used a time - step of @xmath121  fs and hence @xmath122 force evaluations are enough to obtain a configuration where the kinetic energy estimator is uncorrelated .",

    "exactly the mass has to be changed for a single atom in a system that contains hundreds of instances of the naturally - abundant isotope , and the kinetic energy can be computed for that particle only . however , in a homogeneous system such as water it is interesting to explore how sensitive the kinetic energy , and hence the computed fractionation ratio , are to multiple isotope substitutions in the system .",
    "the advantage of making these multiple isotope substitutions is that one can then gather statistics from several atoms at the same time .",
    "momentum - dependent observables tend to be very local in nature , and one can hope that the error introduced by having an unnaturally high concentration of isotope substituted species will be small .",

    "one can also observe that when multiple substitutions are performed the statistical uncertainty of @xmath127 decreases with the square root of the number of substituted atoms .",

    "[ fig : piglet - fep - td]b , piglet reaches convergence with about 6 beads for both the kinetic energy and the fractionation ratio , which is just on the boundary of the region for which performing td - fep up to @xmath106 would become impractical . the fact that piglet was not parameterized to enforce the particular correlation needed for td - fep does not appear to limit its utility in converging it and indeed remarkably it even seems to converge as rapidly as kinetic energy , which is rigorously enforced in the harmonic limit .",
    "although by reducing the required number of beads piglet delays the failure of td - fep the statistical error blows up rendering the estimator unusable beyond 6 - 8 beads ( see figure  [ fig : td - fep - deltah ] ) .",
    "the extra window of mass ratio piglet opens is however incredibly useful since it allows h / d isotope substitution to be computed at room temperature and for ubiquitous aqueous and hydrogen - bonded systems , performing just a single trajectory and using as few as 6 beads .      in the previous section td - fep",
    "was shown to be limited due to possessing a statistical error that grows with the number of beads .",
    "based on our harmonic analysis the sc - fep approach should allow one to obtain a much wider range of mass ratios @xmath42 from a single trajectory .",
    "in addition the analytic predictions suggest that , unlike td - fep , the variance of the difference hamiltonian for sc - fep will show no dependence on the number of beads allowing the path integral simulation to be performed to high precision without the statistical inefficiency rising to unacceptable levels .",

    "figure  [ fig : piglet - fep - sc ] demonstrates that in this case the bead - bead correlations needed to converge the sc - fep estimator are clearly not included in the current piglet parameterization leading to very poor convergence . when using piglet with 6 beads , which is essentially converged for td - fep or direct substitution , the sc - fep estimator gives a kinetic energy estimate for deuterium with an error of 100% and a fractionation ratio which does not even possess the correct sign .",
    "it is reassuring to note that , by further increasing the number of beads , convergence will be eventually reached .",
    "this underlines the robustness of the piglet approach : when a sufficiently large number of beads are used , the non - equilibrium nature of the colored noise naturally vanishes and these methods reduce to conventional pimd .",

    "the direct substitution approach provides a baseline since it has been extensively used in previous studies @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we demonstrate a number of stratgies that greatly improve its efficiency . for a start , by performing a physically motivated smoothing of the integral ( section  [ sub : th - int ] ) one can usually perform the thermodynamic integration with only two simulations for the extremal values of the isotope mass .",
    "in addition the piglet approach can be used to reduce the number of force evaluations required for each simulation .",

    "the free energy perturbation approaches we introduce , however , are even more appealing , in that they allow one to obtain the isotope substitution free energy from a single simulation containing only the majority isotope , and allow one to gather horizontal statistics in an exact way .",
    "however , one must be careful of the statistical efficiency of re - weighting whenever large fluctuations occur in the difference hamiltonian . in the preceding sections",
    "we have presented both analytical and simulation evidence to determine when fep approaches are effective .",
    "this allows us to provide some simple practical guidelines :    * for heavy isotope substitution at temperatures above 100k , one should perform a piglet simulation containing only the most abundant isotope and use the td - fep estimator to extract the free energy change . * for h / d substitution in `` biological '' conditions ( room temperature , aqueous systems ) and at higher temperatures , one should also use td - fep and piglet .",
    "however , this more challenging regime sits on the edge of the td - fep estimator s applicability when combined with piglet .",
    "hence td - fep should not be used with pimd in this regime since the additional beads required for convergence cause the statistical efficiency to become unacceptable . * for isotope substitution below room temperature for h / d or at room temperature when making a substitution with a larger mass ratios than h / d ( e.g muonium / h or h / tritium ) a direct substitution calculation is the best option",
    ". the efficiency of direct substitution can be greatly enhanced by using our transformed integration variable , piglet and , where appropriate , using multiple substitutions .",
    "while the three cases above cover most practical applications , there are circumstances in which the sc - fep estimator becomes competitive . due to the requirement to evaluate the potential on a scaled ring polymer its main advantage lies in cases where the potential can be evaluated efficiently upon a single particle change such as for empirical potentials . as we demonstrated the convergence of the sc - fep",
    "is not improved by piglet and so pimd must be used to simulate the trajectory .",
    "however for empirical potentials pimd trajectories can be made extremely cheap by using ring - polymer contraction techniques@xcite .",
    "sc - fep is also more attractive in problems where only a single atom in the system is substituted such as for a particular proton in an enzyme active site .    since our analytic predictions of the fluctuations in the difference hamiltonians for the fep estimators",

    "we then critically discussed the advantages and shortcomings of these approaches predicating our reasoning on both analytic arguments and on extensive simulations of room - temperature water .",
    "the balance of pros and cons is fundamentally related to the statistical efficiency of sampling of the different techniques .",
    "this , in turns , depends on the `` quantumness '' of the system , as expressed by the ratio between the highest quantum of vibrational energy and the thermal energy , @xmath108 and on the ratio of the masses of the minority isotope and of the naturally abundant one .",
    "when this mass ratio is close to one , as is the case whenever one is dealing with relatively heavy elements such as oxygen , a `` thermodynamic '' fep estimator allows one to compute inexpensively the effect of isotope substitution based on a single simulation which only contains the majority isotope .",
    "this both simplifies and makes less computationally demanding the evaluation of quantities of great interest for geochemistry and climatology .    when instead the mass ratio is large , such as when one needs to substitute deuterium for hydrogen , or when the temperature is considerably below room temperature , the scenario is less clear - cut and one has to weight carefully a number of factors .",
    "the statistical efficiency of the `` thermodynamic '' estimator degrades dramatically with the number of beads , so it becomes mandatory to use piglet to ensure that convergence is achieved with a reduced number of beads . with this caveat ,",
