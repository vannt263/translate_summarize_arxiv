    "although the strength and spatial structure of magnetic fields in the milky way and some other galaxies are reasonably well known today , there is no commonly accepted theory about the origin of these magnetic fields ( see @xcite for recent reviews of the subject ) .",
    "there is a general agreement that the observed microgauss magnetic fields are the result of amplification of weak `` seed '' fields .",
    "the amplification mechanisms under discussion are the so - called `` @xmath2 '' dynamo ( in the case of spiral galaxies ) and/or compression and turbulent motions of plasma during the galaxy / cluster formation processes .",
    "the nature of the initial weak seed fields for the dynamo or turbulent amplification is largely unknown @xcite .",
    "it might be that the seed fields are produced during the epoch of galaxy formation by electrical currents generated by the plasma experiencing gravitational collapse within a proto - galaxy @xcite , or ejected by the first supernovae @xcite or active galactic nuclei @xcite .",
    "otherwise , the seed fields might originate from still earlier epochs of the universe expansion , down to the cosmological phase transitions or inflation times @xcite .",
    "wide uncertainties in both the mechanism of amplification of the seed fields and in the nature of the seed fields themselves have led , over the last half - a - century , to the appearance of a long - standing problem of the `` origin of cosmic magnetic fields '' ( in galaxies and galaxy clusters ) .",
    "it is clear that the clue for the solution of this problem might be given by the measurements of the initial seed fields .",
    "however , up to recently there was little hope that the extremely weak fields outside galaxies and galaxy clusters would ever be detected .    in what follows",
    "we show that direct measurements of the seed fields and derivation of constraints on their nature become possible with the newly available observations in the very - high - energy  band with space and ground - based  telescopes such as _ fermi _ , hess , magic , veritas and , in the near future , cta , agis and hawc .",

    "based on the knowledge of sensitivity of existing and future  telescopes , we find the range of egmf parameters , such as the field strength @xmath3 and the correlation length @xmath4 , in which the egmf is accessible for the measurements with one of the two available measurement techniques ( imaging @xcite or timing @xcite of the cascade signal ) .",

    "[ fig : exclusion_theory ] will not give positive results and the lower bound on egmf strength discussed in section [ sec : bound ] would be confirmed , this would signify that magnetic fields in excess of @xmath301  g are present all over the igm .",
    "a direct test of this result will be possible with the help of imaging of extragalactic  sources .",
    "strong egmf should cause a phenomenon of the presence of `` universal '' extended pair halos around _ all _ extragalactic multi - tev  sources @xcite , with properties which depend on the source redshift , but do not depend on the egmf strength .",
    "namely , if the magnetic field is strong enough , trajectories of @xmath193 pairs are strongly deflected over the cooling length @xmath198 , so that the deflection angle @xmath108 becomes @xmath302 . in this case",
    "the secondary ic photons are emitted isotropically from a region of the size @xmath246 around the primary  source .",

    "the angular size of the halo , @xmath303 , depends on the source redshift , but not on the intrinsic properties of the source or on the egmf strength .",
    "if the primary source ( e.g. a blazar ) emits the primary  flux anisotropically , in a jet with an opening angle @xmath304 , the cascade emission fills a cone with an opening angle @xmath304 and height @xmath305 , rather then forms a spherically symmetric halo around the source . in this case the size of extended source produced by the cascade emission is expected to be smaller , @xmath306 . at the same time , the flux in the extended source is expected to be suppressed by a factor @xmath307 , compared to the primary source flux at the energy @xmath176 .    the halos around sources which are distant enough , @xmath308 , and having significant fluxes at high energies , @xmath309 , should be readily detectable with the current and next generation vhe  telescopes .",
    "in fact , if the primary source flux is characterized by the photon index @xmath310 the extended halo flux could dominate over the primary source flux at the energy @xmath250 , in the case of an isotropic primary source and be moderately below the point source flux in the case of an anisotropic primary source .",
    "for example , the flux from the brightest tev blazars is at the level @xmath311  erg/@xmath289s at the energies @xmath312  tev . if the primary emission from the source is beamed into a jet with an opening angle @xmath313 ( plausible assumption which implies the bulk lorentz factor @xmath261 for the blazar jet ) , the expected egmf - independent extended emission flux at the energies i.e. at the level detectable by _",
    "the part of the @xmath8 parameter space in which the existence of non - zero egmf could be established via imaging  observations , but no measurement of egmf is possible , is shown as an upper light - grey shaded region in fig .",

    "we have discussed the prospects of detection of weak magnetic fields in the intergalactic medium with the novel techniques of timing and imaging observations with ground and space - based  telescopes .",
    "these techniques enable measurements of extremely weak magnetic fields with strengths much lower than the ones accessible for the measurements with radio telescopes ( via zeeman splitting and/or faraday rotation techniques ) .",
    "we have demonstrated that using  observations one can detect , or rule out the possibility of existence of cosmologically or astrophysically produced `` seed '' magnetic fields in the voids of the large scale structure , which are conjectured to exist in a range of theories of the origin of magnetic fields in galaxies and galaxy clusters ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : exclusion_theory ] ) .    to summarize",
