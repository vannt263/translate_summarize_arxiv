    "<S> it has been observed that the odderon problem is equivalent to the system of 3 conformal spins @xcite @xcite associated with each reggeon @xmath7 : @xmath8 here @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the odderon intercept @xmath10 is related to the eigenvalue @xmath11 of the interaction hamiltonian of the conformal spins : @xmath12 equation ( [ ham ] ) exhibits conformal separability into holomorphic and antiholomorphic parts , the latter depending only on @xmath13 . therefore @xmath14 and the wave function is given as a bilinear form @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> there are two conditions for the total wave function  1 ) @xmath16 has to be single - valued and 2 ) normalizable  which determine the spectrum of @xmath11 .    </S>",
    "<S> there are two scalars which can be constructed from three spins : @xmath17 it has been shown in refs.@xcite @xcite that the casimir operator @xmath0 ( denoted in the literature as @xmath18 ) and @xmath1 ( denoted often as @xmath19 ) can be simultaneously diagonalized . in that sense the model is fully integrable . </S>",
    "<S> eigenvalues @xmath2 of @xmath0 ( see eq.([q2psi]))are called conformal weights . in the following , the operator @xmath1 will be called _ </S>",
    "<S> odderon charge_.    there have been many attempts to find either directly values of @xmath11 @xcite @xcite or spectrum of @xmath1 @xcite . in the recent paper janik and wosiek </S>",
    "<S> @xcite calculated the spectrum of @xmath1 for @xmath20 , which corresponds to the lowest representation of the sl(2,@xmath3 ) group , and found the odderon intercept with @xmath21 .    in the present paper </S>",
    "<S> we shall concentrate on calculating the spectrum of the odderon charge for arbitrary @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we shall first consider the holomorphic sector only ; however the same arguments apply to the antiholomorphic sector as well .    following lipatov @xcite we shall use conformal ansatz for @xmath22 : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is a reference point . </S>",
    "<S> a remarkable feature of ansatz ( [ psi ] ) is , that @xmath0 is automatically diagonal : @xmath26 in the representation ( [ psi ] ) the eigenvalue equation for @xmath27 takes the following form : @xmath28 \\,\\psi ^{\\prime } ( x )   \\nonumber \\\\ & & -2x(x-1)(2x-1)\\,\\psi ^{\\prime \\prime } ( x)\\;\\;-x^2(x-1)^2\\,\\psi ^{\\prime \\prime \\prime } ( x ) .   </S>",

    "<S> it has 3 regular singular points : at @xmath29 , 1 and @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the solutions of the indicial equation around 0 read : @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that in the vicinity of 0 there are two power series solutions and a logarithmic one . </S>",
    "<S> the same holds for the solutions around @xmath34 and @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the authors of ref.@xcite formulated quantization conditions for @xmath27 by imposing singlevalueness constraints on the whole wave function @xmath16 , and solved them for @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> discrete , symmetrically distributed values of @xmath27 have been found on the imaginary , as well as on the real axis in the complex @xmath27 plane . </S>",
    "<S> however , only the imaginary values of @xmath27 are relevant for the odderon problem ; real @xmath27 s correspond to the wave function which is antisymmetric if the two neighboring reggeons are exchanged , whereas the odderon wave function should be symmetric under such transformations @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> let us rewrite eq.([q3x ] ) in terms of a new variable : @xmath35 suggested in the ref.@xcite , where modular invariance of the odderon equation has been discussed . </S>",
    "<S> this mapping sends all singular points of eq.([q3x ] ) , _ i.e. _ @xmath29 , 1 and @xmath30 to infinity . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of using variable @xmath36 instead of @xmath37 consists in the symmetry properties of @xmath38 under the cyclic permutations of the three reggeized gluons , which correspond to : @xmath39 under transformations ( [ perms ] ) @xmath36 remains unchanged . </S>",

    "<S> the advantage of using ( [ q3xi ] ) is twofold : 1 ) because of the symmetry properties ( [ perms ] ) the quantization condition takes a simpler form than in the case of eq.([q3x ] ) , 2 ) since eq.([q3xi ] ) is less singular than eq.([q3x ] ) the solutions of the indicial equation do not depend on @xmath2 . because of the latter it is easy to find spectrum of @xmath1 for an arbitrary @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> .    equation ( [ q3xi ] ) has 3 regular singular points in @xmath42 and in infinity . </S>",
    "<S> in what follows we shall consider only solutions around @xmath43 : @xmath44 the phases of the two solutions are chosen in such a way , that they are real for real @xmath45 and real @xmath27 . </S>",

    "<S> we choose to calculate it at @xmath63 . repeating the same steps in the antiholomorphic sector one constructs @xmath64 where : @xmath65 here @xmath66 denotes the odderon charge in the antiholomorphic sector , whereas the _ star _ over @xmath27 denotes complex conjugation . in principle </S>",
    "<S> two possible choices for @xmath66 , namely with + and @xmath67 signs should be considered . </S>",
    "<S> this follows from the fact that both @xmath68 and @xmath69 are symmetric functions of @xmath27 ( or @xmath66 ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , only the choice of eq.([qbar ] ) leads to the non - zero solutions of the quantization conditions in the definition of @xmath36 ( [ xi ] ) , our sign for @xmath66 is different than the one in ref.@xcite . ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum of the conformal weights follows from the integrability requirements : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is an integer . </S>",
    "<S> however , as can be seen from the general form of the wave function ( [ psi ] ) , @xmath71 has to be a multiple of 3 in order to make @xmath72 single - valued . </S>",
    "<S> singlevaluedness of @xmath73 alone allows for another condition : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is an arbitrary real number . </S>",
    "<S> this condition , however , does not correspond to the physical odderon state .    </S>",
    "<S> the single - valued wave function can be constructed only if both sectors , holomorphic and antiholomorphic , are considered . </S>",
    "<S> for example in the vicinity of @xmath76 and @xmath77 the wave function of the whole system reads :    @xmath78    similarly in the vicinity of @xmath79 and @xmath80 we have : @xmath81    the requirement that the wave function @xmath73 should be single - valued , leads to the observation that matrices @xmath82 have to be diagonal : @xmath83 \\;,\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;a^{(1)}=\\left [ \\begin{array}{lll } \\alpha ^{\\prime } & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\beta ^{\\prime } & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\gamma ^{\\prime } \\end{array } \\right ] \\;.   </S>",

    "<S> finally matrix @xmath93 reads : @xmath94 \\ , .   </S>",
    "<S> \\label{matrb}\\ ] ]    quantization conditions follow from the requirement that there exist non - zero solutions of eq.([cond2 ] ) for @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 : @xmath98 moreover the first two equations in ( [ cond2 ] ) should be uniquely solvable for @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 in function of one free parameter ( which is not automatic even if eqs.([cond3 ] ) are satisfied ) .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now discuss numerical solutions of the quantization conditions ( [ cond3 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that the zero eigenvalue of the odderon charge exists always for arbitrary conformal weight . </S>",
    "<S> korchemsky @xcite has argued that these states should be excluded from the spectrum of the odderon hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) , since it is not clear if they are normalizable ( see however ref.@xcite ) . in what follows </S>",
    "<S> we shall concentrate only on the imaginary solutions for @xmath27 which , as already said , are relevant for the odderon system .    </S>",

    "<S> these eigenvalues have been found previously in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath102 only one non - zero eigenvalue of @xmath27 is visible in fig.1 , namely @xmath114 . </S>",
    "<S> we have also found two next eigenvalues corresponding to im@xmath115 and @xmath116 .    </S>",
