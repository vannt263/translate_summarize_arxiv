    "according to contemporary cosmology , the present energy content of the universe is composed of approximately @xmath22 ordinary matter , @xmath23 dark matter and @xmath24 dark energy @xcite .",
    "the expansion of the universe began in a tremendous inflationary burst driven by the vacuum energy with the planck density @xmath25 . between @xmath26 and @xmath27 seconds after the beginning ( big bang ) , the universe expanded by a factor @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "inflation does not offer any explanation for the time before that `` beginning '' .",
    "the universe then entered in the radiation era and , when the temperature cooled down below approximately @xmath29 , in the matter era @xcite . at present",
    ", it undergoes an accelerated expansion @xcite presumably due to the cosmological constant or to some form of dark energy with negative pressure violating the strong energy condition @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a second period of inflation , which is different from the first since it is driven by the cosmological energy density @xmath14 instead of the planck density . despite the success of this model , the nature of dark matter , dark energy , and of the very early universe ( pre - radiation era ) remains very mysterious and leads to many speculations .",
    "the phase of inflation in the early universe is usually described by some hypothetical scalar field @xmath30 with its origin in quantum fluctuations of vacuum @xcite .",
    "this leads to an equation of state @xmath31 , implying a constant energy density , called the vacuum energy .",
    "this energy density is usually identified with the planck density @xmath32 . as a result of the vacuum energy ,",
    "the universe expands exponentially rapidly on a timescale of the order of the planck time @xmath33 ( early inflation ) .",
    "this phase of inflation is followed by the radiation era described by an equation of state @xmath34 . in our previous paper ( paper i )",
    ", we showed that a unified description of the pre - radiation ( @xmath35 ) and radiation ( @xmath36 ) eras , connected by a phase of exponential inflation , could be obtained from a single equation of state of the form @xmath37 .",
    "this provides a non - singular model of the early universe .    the phase of acceleration in the present universe is usually ascribed to the cosmological constant @xmath18 which is equivalent to a constant energy density @xmath38 called dark energy",
    "this can be modeled by an equation of state @xmath31 , implying a constant energy density identified with the cosmological density @xmath39 . as a result of the dark energy ,",
    "the universe expands exponentially rapidly on a timescale of the order of the cosmological time @xmath15 ( de sitter solution ) .",
    "this leads to a second phase of inflation ( late inflation ) .",
    "inspired by the analogy with the early inflation , some authors have represented the dark energy by a scalar field called quintessence @xcite . as an alternative to the quintessence",
    ", other authors @xcite have proposed to model the acceleration of the universe by an exotic fluid with an equation of state of the form @xmath40 called the chaplygin gas ( see @xcite for a complete list of references ) . at late times , this equation of state leads to a constant energy density implying an exponential growth of the scale factor that is similar to the effect of the cosmological constant . at earlier times",
    ", this equation of state returns the results of the cold dark matter model .",
    "therefore , it provides a unification of dark matter ( @xmath41 ) and dark energy ( @xmath42 ) in the late universe .",
    "furthermore , it gives a real velocity of sound which is non - trivial for fluids with negative pressure .",
    "some generalizations of this equation of state have been considered in the form @xmath43 with @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in @xcite , the chaplygin gas has some connection with string theory and can be obtained from the nambu - goto action for @xmath45-branes moving in a @xmath46)-dimensional spacetime in the light - cone parametrization .",
    "furthermore , it is the only fluid which , up to now , admits a supersymmetric generalization .    from a theoretical point of view , it is desirable to study models of universe with a generalized equation of state @xmath47 having a standard linear component and a polytropic component .",
    "the linear equation of state @xmath1 describes radiation ( @xmath2 ) , pressureless matter ( @xmath3 ) , stiff matter ( @xmath4 ) , and vacuum energy ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the polytropic equation of state @xmath48 with @xmath49 may be due to bose - einstein condensates with repulsive ( @xmath7 ) or attractive ( @xmath8 ) self - interaction @xcite , or have another origin .",
    "when @xmath50 , the polytropic component dominates the linear component when the density is high .",
    "these models , studied in paper i , describe the early universe .",
    "conversely , when @xmath9 , the polytropic component dominates the linear component when the density is low .",
    "these models , studied in the present paper , describe the late universe .",
    "as we shall see , these two studies are strikingly symmetric .",
    "interestingly , this symmetry seems to reflect the true evolution of the universe .    in this paper ,",
    "we propose an exhaustive study of the equation of state @xmath47 with @xmath9 .",
    "when @xmath7 , the universe exhibits a future peculiarity : its density vanishes in infinite time ( @xmath51 ) , or periodically in time ( @xmath52 ) , while its radius tends to a constant value ( the universe is singular when @xmath53 since the pressure becomes infinite in finite time ) . for @xmath3 , @xmath10 and @xmath16 , we obtain a model of cyclic universe , equivalent to the anti-@xmath18cdm model , in which the universe `` disappears '' ( it becomes empty ) and `` reappears '' periodically . according to this model",

    "this choice was made by early cosmologists .",
    "a pressureless universe describes the matter era ( eds model ) .",

    "this equation of state describes the ( relativistic ) radiation era .",

    "the next simplest choice is therefore to consider a mixed equation of state of the form @xmath0 with a linear component and a polytropic component .",

    "the most natural non - singular model of universe corresponds to a solution of the einstein equations that exists eternally in the past and in the future .",

    "for that reason , it may be selected by nature .",
    "furthermore , this universe is very `` symmetric '' in its early and late phases ( corresponding to a vanishing cosmological constant ) is also non - singular and simpler .",
    "however , if we add a principle of `` symmetry '' ( @xmath435 aesthetics ) , in addition to the principle of `` simplicity '' , we are left with the model discussed previously . ] .",
    "this symmetry can be seen in the values of the polytropic indices @xmath434 and @xmath10 that characterize the early and the late universe , respectively .",

    "[ trhologlogcomplet ] , which is also strikingly symmetric .",

    "in that model , a quantum tunneling process explains the birth of the universe with a well defined size after tunneling .",
    "therefore , other inflationary scenarios are possible in addition to the one given in paper i in terms of the generalized equation of state ( [ b10 ] ) . however , our aim was to explore all the consequences of this generalized equation of state , pushing it to its limits .",

    "[ trhologlogcomplet ] , the planck density and the cosmological density represent fundamental upper and lower density bounds acting in the early and late universe , respectively .",
    "it is not surprising therefore that they are so different : @xmath437 . because of these bounds , the universe undergoes two phases of inflation .",

    "the inflation in the late universe is due to the cosmological constant and is related to the cosmological density @xmath39 .",

    "actually , there is a complete symmetry between the small and large universe where @xmath423 and @xmath18 play symmetric roles .",
    "therefore , we interpret the cosmological constant as a fundamental constant of physics describing the cosmophysics ( late universe ) in the same sense that the planck constant describes the microphysics ( early universe ) .    if this interpretation is correct , the origin of the dark energy density @xmath39 should not be sought in quantum mechanics , but in pure general relativity . in this sense ,",
    "the cosmological constant `` problem '' may be a false problem .",
    "if @xmath18 is a fundamental constant of physics , independent from the others , its value should not cause problem .",

    "one can just expect that @xmath32 is `` very large '' and @xmath39 is `` very small '' .",
    "of course , the origin of the cosmological constant still needs to be understood by developing a theory of cosmophysics .",
