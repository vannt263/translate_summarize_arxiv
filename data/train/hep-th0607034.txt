    "in the past years there has been growing interest on studying models with extra dimensions in which the standard model fields are confined on a 3-brane playing the role of our 4-dimensional world , while gravity can propagate both on the brane and in the bulk @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the extra dimensions need not be compact and in particular it was shown that it is possible to localize gravity on a 3-brane when there is one infinite extra dimension @xcite@xcite .",
    "one of the striking consequences of the theories with large extra dimensions is that the lowering of the fundamental gravity scale allows the production of mini black holes in the universe .",
    "such mini black holes are centered on the brane and may have been created in the early universe due to density perturbations and phase transitions .",
    "recently it was proposed that such mini black holes may also be produced in particle collision with the mass energy of tev order or in the earth atmosphere due to the high energy cosmic ray showers @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "once produced , these black holes will go through a number of stages in their lives @xcite@xcite@xcite , namely : i ) the balding phase , where the black hole sheds the hair inherited from original ordinary object ; ii ) the spin - down phase , where the black hole loses its angular momentum ; iii ) the schwarzschild quantum phase , where the black hole s mass will be decreased due to quantum process and finally iv ) the planck phase . in the first phase",
    ", the black hole emits mainly gravitational radiation , while in the second and the third phases , the black hole will lose its energy mainly through the emission of the hawking radiation .",
    "it was argued that during a certain time interval the evolution of the perturbation around black hole is dominated by damped single - frequency oscillation , called quasinormal modes ( qnm ) , which carries unique fingerprint of the black hole and is expected to be detected through gravitational wave observations in the near future ( see reviews on this topic and references therein @xcite ) .",
    "recently the qnm of a brane - world black hole has been studied in [ 13 ] .",
    "the gravitational radiation of the mini black hole would be a characteristic sound and can tell us the existence of such black hole .",
    "another possibility of observing signatures of this kind of mini black hole exists in particle accelerator experiments , where the spectrum of hawking radiation emitted by these small black holes can be detected @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "since these small black holes carry information of extra dimensions and have different properties compared to ordinary 4-dimensional black holes , these two tools of detecting mini black holes can help to read the extra dimensions .",
    "the motivation of the present paper is to study signals of tiny black holes in the modern brane world scenarios[12 ] . under the assumptions of the theory ,",
    "most standard matter fields are brane - localized , therefore from the observational point of view it is much more interesting to study the brane - localized modes in the qnm and hawking radiation . in the hawking radiation study",
    ", it was found that the emission on the brane is dominated compared to that off the brane @xcite .",
    "we will investigate brane world black holes in the 4-dimensional background and study the qnm and the emission of brane - localized hawking radiation . by comparing the properties of qnm and hawking radiation to those in ordinary 4-dimensional black holes",
    ", we will argue that the dependence of these properties on the extra dimension of spacetime could be read if the spectrum of qnm and hawking radiation are detected . in our following study",
    ", we will employ the exact black hole solution to the effective field equations on the brane , which is of the reissner - nordstrom type given as @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 , and @xmath2 is not the electric charge of the conventional reissner - nordstrom ( rn ) metric , but the tidal charge arising from the projection onto the brane of the gravitational field in the bulk .",
    "thus @xmath2 contains the information of the extra dimension . for @xmath3 ,",
    "this metric is a direct analogy to the reissner - nordstrom solution with two horizons and both horizons lie inside the schwarzschild horizon @xmath4 . for @xmath5 ,",
    "the metric has only one horizon given by @xmath6 , which is larger than the schwarzschild horizon .",
    "we will concentrate our attention on @xmath5 , since it was argued that this negative tidal charge is the physically more natural case @xcite .",
    "astrophysics limits the appearance of the reissner - nordstrom black hole with macroscopic electric charge , while there is no exact constraint on the emergence of the effective reissner - nordstrom black hole with tidal charge , especially negative tidal charge .",
    "however the tidal charge affects the geodesics and the gravitational potential , so that its value should receive at least indirect limit from observations , which needs careful study . on the other hand ,",
    "tidal charge contains the information of extra dimensions .",
    "it is of great interest to investigate its influence on the gravitational wave and hawking radiation observations and whether it can leave us the signature of the extra dimension .",
    "this paper is organized as following . in sec.ii",
    ", we will investigate the qnm of the braneworld black hole with tidal charge .",
    "we will study the scalar as well as the gravitational perturbations in the background of this black hole .",
    "in sec.iii , we will examine the absorption and emission problems for the scalar and the brane - localized graviton in the background of the braneworld black hole .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in sec.iv . for simplicity",
    "we will adopt the nature units in the following discussion .",
    "the effective 4d field equation on the brane , which is induced by the 5d einstein equation in the bulk , is written as @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the symmetric and tracefree limit on the brane of projected bulk weyl tensor @xmath9}= 0 = e^{\\mu}_{\\mu } $ ] , if we only take the vacuum solution into account and take a vanishing cosmological constant .",
    "the bianchi identity on the brane requires the constraint @xmath10 as mentioned in @xcite , eq.([e2 ] ) and eq.([e3 ] ) form a closed system of equations on the brane for static solutions .",
    "dadhich et.al .",
    "@xcite investigated one of the vacuum static solutions on the brane and pointed out that einstein - maxwell solutions in general relativity provides a vacuum static brane - world solution , because both @xmath8 from the influence of bulk and the energy momentum tensor of electromagnetic field satisfy eq.([e2 ] ) and eq.([e3 ] ) in spite of their different origins .",
    "hence the 4d metric on the brane is given by @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath2 is a dimensionless tidal charge parameter .",
    "when @xmath13 , this solution has two horizons and has similar properties to that of the reissner - nordstrom solution .",
    "the new situation occurs when @xmath14 and the black hole has only one horizon which is bigger than the schwarzschild horizon .",
    "so the negative tidal charge increases the entropy and decreases the temperature of the black hole . with the negative tidal charge",
    "the bulk influences tend to strengthen the gravitational field .",
    "this opinion was supported by the perturbative @xcite and nonperturbative analysis @xcite .",
    "we will concentrate our discussion on the brane world black hole with the negative @xmath2 .",
    "it is worthy to emphasis that although the 4d metric on the brane is known as eq.([e4 ] ) , the exact solution in the 5d bulk has not been given yet and is still a challenging task to find .",
    "choosing negative @xmath2 ( in the following we express the negative tidal charge to be @xmath15 ) , for simplicity we rewrite the metric on the 4d brane @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are two roots of @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xmath17 is the black hole horizon , while @xmath21 is negative and without physical meaning .",
    "now we start to consider the perturbations around this black hole . for massless scalar perturbations ,",
    "the wave equation is given by the klein - gordon equation @xmath22 which can be reduced to @xmath23 where : @xmath24 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the effective potential . in deriving the above equation ,",
    "we have used the variables separation @xmath25 and introduced the tortoise coordinate , given by @xmath26    the behaviors of the effective potential @xmath27 are shown in fig.[f1 ] .",
    "we see that just outside the black hole , there is a potential barrier .",
    "this barrier increases with the increase of the angular index @xmath28 . while for the same @xmath28 , the appearance of the negative tidal charge as a sequence of strengthening the gravitational field by the bulk effects suppressed the potential barrier .    due to the potential barrier out of the black hole",
    ", the massless scalar perturbation will experience the quasinormal ringing .",
    "using the null coordinates @xmath29 and @xmath30 , we can rewrite eq(8 ) as @xmath31 where @xmath32 should be obtained by the inverse relation @xmath33 .",
    "we can numerically solve this equation by the finite difference method @xmath34 where points @xmath35 form a null rectangle with the relative position as @xmath36 and @xmath37 . employing this numerical method proposed in @xcite",
    ", we can observe the object picture of the quasinormal ringing and obtain the frequencies of the fundamental mode .",
    "fig.[f8 ] shows the massless scalar wave outside the negative tidal charge black hole and table.i presents us the frequencies . for the negative tidal charge",
    ", we observed that when the @xmath15 increases , the massless scalar perturbation will have less oscillations and decay more slowly .",
    "this behavior of the wave evolution is monotone with the increase of @xmath15 if the tidal charge @xmath38 is negative . for comparison",
    ", we have also calculated the qnm for positive charged black hole , the result is similar to that of the rn black hole disclosed in @xcite@xcite@xcite . unlike the negative charged case , for the positive charge",
    ", the quasinormal ringing decays faster than the case when @xmath39 .",
    "the qnm of the black hole for the @xmath39 case , which is the 4d schwarzschild black hole , serves as a border separating the quasinormal ringing behaviors of the positive and negative charged black hole .",
    "@xmath40    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     now we discuss briefly the case for @xmath41 .",
    "the non - vanishing imaginary part of the potentials @xmath42 leads to the non - zero r.h.s of the wronskian equation @xmath43 \\equiv ij_i,\\ ] ] whose solution is easily obtained @xmath44 if we still define the current density as in @xcite , the flux conservation on the brane can not be held due to the existence of the second term in the r.h.s of eq.([e40 ] ) .",
    "this means that for a certain tidal charge parameter , the flux of the gravitational perturbation in the higher modes satisfying @xmath45 can not stay on the brane but leave into the bulk inevitably ( at least part of it does so ) , though the perturbation is created on the brane . in other words ,",
    "when the tidal parameter @xmath46 , the gravitational perturbation may leave the brane and could be very hard to detect even for the low angular index @xmath47 in our method .",
    "this is an effect of the extra dimension .",
    "the detailed and precise analysis on the absorption and emission of the more negatively tidal charged brane - world black hole is not clear at this moment , since the exact solution of the metric in the 5d bulk is still unknown . on the other hand , many researches @xcite show that the emission is denominated by that on the brane , hence the emission of the non brane - localized gravitons is beyond our discussion and can not be analyzed appropriately in our present frame .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the perturbations around the brane - world black hole whose projected bulk effects are represented by the tidal charge .",
    "the positive tidal charged black hole is of the rn type and the negative one has only one horizon , which is larger than that of the 4d schwarzschild case surrounding the central singularity .",
    "the effect of the negative tidal charge strengthens the gravitational field and lowers the temperature of the black hole @xcite .",
    "we have calculated the qnms for both massless scalar field perturbation and gravitational perturbations .",
    "we have compared them to the case of the 4d schwarzschild and rn black holes with the same mass .",
    "for the negative tidal charge case , unlike those observed in rn black hole , there is no critical charge where qnm differs below and above this critical charge @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "when the negative tidal charge becomes more negative , the perturbations stay longer with less oscillations regardless of what types of perturbations .",
    "the qnms of the negative tidal charge and positive tidal charge black holes are separated by that of the 4d schwarzschild black hole",
    ".    however , the influence of the tidal charge on the hawking radiation are not as simple as that on the qnms . in the scalar field ,",
    "the negative tidal charge @xmath15 suppresses the effective potential barrier and the absorption cross section increases correspondingly as a consequence of its effect strengthening the gravitational field .",
    "it is interesting that the emission spectrum does not simply decrease with the temperature as that in the background of rn black hole @xcite .",
    "there exist the critical values @xmath48 . when @xmath49 , the peak of the emission spectrum is smaller than that of schwarzschild black hole of the same mass .",
    "but if we take @xmath50 , despite that the temperature is lower , the emission becomes stronger compared to the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "this is the result of the enhancement of the absorption cross section and the decrease of the temperature according to eq.([e24 ] ) caused by the negative tidal charge , which changes our usual picture about the hawking radiation in 4d black holes .",
    "we emphasis that it is a new behavior which has not been observed before .    as for the graviton",
    ", we find that when @xmath51 , the conservation of the graviton flux on the brane is broken and the leakage of the gravitons requires the exact solution of the brane world black hole in the bulk which has not been known yet .",
    "we have investigated only the hawking radiation of the brane - localized gravitons under the condition @xmath52 . as pointed out before , there are two kinds of gravitational perturbations : @xmath53(or @xmath54 ) referring to those generated mainly by the fluctuation of the bulk effects and @xmath55(or @xmath56 ) to those created by the factors on the brane .",
    "all these potential barriers are suppressed by the negative tidal charge . as a result ,",
    "the absorption cross sections increase .",
    "for the potential @xmath55(or @xmath56 ) , the behaviors of the partial emission spectrums are much similar to those in the scalar field and there is a critical value @xmath48 , beyond which the peak of the emission spectrum is smaller and below this @xmath48 , the emission spectrum is stronger compared to that of the 4d schwarzschild black hole , although with the negative tidal charge we always have lower black hole temperature . but for the potential @xmath53(or @xmath54 ) ,",
    "no matter what is the value of the tidal charge , the emission spectrum of the brane world black hole is always stronger than that of the schwarzschild black hole for the brane - localized gravitons .",
    "the phenomenon of increasing emission spectrum with decreasing temperature in the brane world black hole has not been observed before .",
    "this is an effect of the negative tidal charge caused by the bulk effect .",
    "we conclude that both the qnms and the hawking radiation have given signatures of negative tidal charge due to the bulk effects in the brane - world black hole , which differs from that of the 4d schwarzschild black hole .",
    "we expect that these signatures can be observed in the future experiments , which could help us learn the properties of the extra dimensions .",
