    "<S> time reversal of quantum dynamics can be achieved by a global change of the hamiltonian sign ( a hasty loschmidt daemon ) , as in the loschmidt echo experiments in nmr , or by a local but persistent procedure ( a stubborn daemon ) as in the time reversal mirror ( trm ) used in ultrasound acoustics . </S>",
    "<S> while the first is limited by chaos and disorder , the last procedure seems to benefit from it . as a first step to quantify such stability </S>",
    "<S> we develop a procedure , the perfect inverse filter ( pif ) , that accounts for memory effects , and we apply it to a system of coupled oscillators . in order to ensure a many - body dynamics numerically intrinsically reversible , we develop an algorithm , the pair partitioning , based on the trotter strategy used for quantum dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze situations where the pif gives substantial improvements over the trm .    </S>",
    "<S> ,    ,    ,    in the last years , the group of m. fink in paris developed an experimental technique called time reversal mirror ( trm ) that allows the time reversal of acoustic excitations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an ultrasonic pulse , produced inside a control region ( also called cavity ) where it suffers multiple scattering processes , is detected by several microphones as it escapes through the boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> these transducers can also act as loudspeakers and the registered signal is played back in the time reversed sequence . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the signal focalizes in the source point forming a loschmidt echo @xcite . according to the existing theory , </S>",
    "<S> an exact control of the wave function in the cavity would require the control of the wave function and the normal derivative at the boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> however , the reversal is quite good even when these conditions are not fulfilled by the experiment : the detectors might not enclose the cavity or the recording time period could be reduced to a fraction . </S>",
    "<S> another surprising feature of this time reversion procedure is that it shows a much better stability in inhomogeneus media as compared to ordered ones . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to numerous applications in medical physics @xcite and communications @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a first step to asses the errors is to develop a procedure that could achieve perfect reversal . </S>",
    "<S> this task was developed for the domain of quantum waves and was named perfect inverse filter ( pif ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the pif procedure assures the exact reversion by injecting a wave function that compensates precisely the feedback effects through a frequency dependent renormalization that involves the exact green s function at the injection sites . here </S>",
    "<S> , we use a simple microscopic model that presents wave behavior and describes energy dissipation to show that the pif procedure also applies in the classical domain . </S>",
    "<S> the model , represented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_scheme ] , is a variation of that of rubin @xcite : a surface oscillator with mass @xmath0 and natural frequency @xmath1 is coupled to a semi - infinite harmonic chain of bulk oscillators with mass @xmath2 .        </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in the time reversion of the initial condition where all the oscillators are in their equilibrium positions except for the surface one . </S>",
    "<S> the energy stored in the surface oscillator is expected to decay due to the effective friction produced by the environmentof light masses . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian is : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the natural frequency of the @xmath5th oscillator and @xmath6 describes the displacement from the equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> springs with elastic constant @xmath7 accounts for the coupling between first neighbors . for the proposed model , </S>",
    "<S> all springs and masses are equal and @xmath8 , except for the heavier surface mass that suffers an additional harmonic restitutive force ( @xmath1 is finite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the exchange frequency @xmath9 and the ratio @xmath10 have been chosen to set the system in the extended - oscillatory dynamical regime @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the equations of motion in the frequency domain can be written in the matrix form@xmath11where @xmath12 is the resolvent associated to the dynamical matrix in the site basis@xmath13the resolvent provides the solutions to eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq_motion ] with impulsive forces @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> this is,@xmath15notice that @xmath16 relates the @xmath17th displacement amplitude due to an initial condition of velocity in the @xmath5th oscillator . in general , the solution of the eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq_motion ] in presence of forces @xmath18 results@xmath19and can be rewritten as@xmath20where @xmath21 is the fourier transform of the force applied at mass @xmath5 that is a sum of two components : an impulsive force and  a shifting force . </S>",
    "<S> this last is able to produce an instantaneous  shift @xmath22 in the position without changing its momentum . </S>",
    "<S> this would require that a first impulsive kick  be followed by a compensating one:@xmath23 , \\]]which in frequency domain means:@xmath24thus , in the time domain@xmath25which serves as a definition for the position - position response function , also called the green s function:@xmath26on the other hand we will use linearity to write the observed displacement in terms of @xmath27 , the forced position shift accumulated in the unit time:@xmath28we seek the injection function @xmath27 that produces the exact reversion of the original wave within the control region , i.e. @xmath29 for @xmath30 . according to ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the perfect time reversal is possible if the dynamics starts and ends up without any excitation inside the cavity . </S>",
    "<S> even when our system starts with an excitedcavity , the lack of momentum at each mass ensures that forward and backwards evolutions are identical . </S>",
    "<S> once the decay signal is registered at the transducer for positive time , the earlier time values ( corresponding to a fictitious injection ) are also known and we build the function to be inverted at time @xmath31 @xmath32and the injection function can be obtained in the frequency domain by@xmath33this equation defines the perfect inverse filter ( pif ) for a classical wave , where the injection prescribed by the trm procedure appears now corrected by the green s function @xmath34 . the time evolution of the displacement amplitude is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> fig_dynamic for several situations . </S>",
    "<S> the recording time @xmath31 is longer than the decay time in the whole cavity , i.e. all the masses in the control region have enough time to recover their equilibrium positions .    . </S>",
    "<S> down - right : response function in @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the chosen parameters are : @xmath36 , @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41.,width=283 ]    the injection functions of both procedures differs near the bandedges ( @xmath42 ) indicating that trm corrections are importants in cases where the whole spectrum is involved ( typically in broadband experiments ) . </S>",
    "<S> when all the masses in the cavity are in their equilibrium position , the injection at the source point @xmath35 produces oscillations that propagate both sides of @xmath43 only dynamics inside the cavity is fully reversed . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_decrec ] shows the local energy of the surface oscillator @xmath44its decay and recovering presents the three temporal domains @xcite : it begins with a quadratic dependence , continues with an exponential decay associated with a self consistent fermi golden rule , and becomes an inverse power law when the energy return is comparable to the residual energy in the surface mode . </S>",
    "<S> the time reversed signal reproduces all the three regimes , even when they involve very different signal intensities .        </S>",
    "<S> we attempt to asses the quality of the reversal by the loschmidt echo jalabert of a wave function @xmath45 normalized in the cavity:@xmath46first , the inner product uses a metric tensor given by the hamiltonian , i.e. we refer the recovered energy to that originally contained within the control region . considering the case where @xmath47 , the pif yields @xmath48 while the trm gives @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> this result is not representative of the evidenced by fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_recovering ] . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , we use the euclidean metric tensor , obtaining @xmath50 and @xmath51 , i.e. in pif all the initial condition have been recovered whereas in trm there is a spreading of displacements and velocities along the cavity .        the reversed local energy in both procedures is compared in fig . fig_energy . </S>",
    "<S> the pif procedure can not be distinguished from the ideal reversal . </S>",
    "<S> the trm has two failures : the amplitude of the local energy at @xmath52 is always less than the initial case and the temporal regimes are delayed .        in summary , </S>",
    "<S> the time reversion of the dynamics of a pendulum coupled to an harmonic chain has been done by means of two types of stubborn daemons : 1 ) the trm , which neglects memory effects ( meaning that an instantaneous system response is assummed ) . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) the pif , that accounts for memory and feedback . </S>",
    "<S> this last is much better if the initial condition is build up over the whole range of frequencies . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the correction of the green s function becomes non trivial and ensures a better reversion quality . </S>"
