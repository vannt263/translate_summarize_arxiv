    "the quantum walk ( qw ) is important in physics as a generalization of the ubiquitous random walk ( rw ) , which underpins diffusion and brownian motion .",
    "qws are important in quantum algorithm research  @xcite because they exponentially speed up hitting time in glued tree graphs  @xcite .",
    "although realization of a qw by a quantum quincunx , analogous to the quincunx ( or galton board ) for realizing the rw , has been proposed in ion traps  @xcite and cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed )  @xcite , the former requires cooling of ions to the center - of - mass motional ground state , and the latter hitting the atom with pulses that do not drive the cavity at all : these obstacles prevent quantum walks from being realized under foreseeable experimental conditions ( a classical optical simulation of a quantum quincunx has been performed  @xcite but can not be a proper qw without complementarity  @xcite ) .    here",
    "we devise a quantum quincunx that can realize a qw in the laboratory for the first time by : ( i )  employing the jaynes - cummings model  @xcite to generalize the hadamard transformation for coin flipping by directly driving the cavity rather than the atom ; ( ii )  developing a theory of qws on many circles in phase space ( ps ) rather than on a single circle as a consequence of generalizing the hadamard transformation ; ( iii )  optimizing the protocol by having the duration of the generalized hadamard transformation depend on the time - dependent mean photon number in the cavity ( with detailed theory to appear elsewhere  @xcite ) ; ( iv )  implementing in a superconducting circuit qed system  @xcite with a two - level cooper pair box ( cpb ) serving as the quantum coin and a coplanar transmission line resonator with a single mode as the quantum walker ; ( v )  introducing a double resonator scheme that can control decoherence while simultaneously enabling strong coupling between the cpb and the microwave field and permitting fast readout ; and ( vi )  using the holevo standard deviation as a measure of phase spreading and showing that the rate of spreading can be tuned by controllable decoherence to observe the quadratic enhancement of phase spreading for the qw vs rw .    in our scheme",
    "the qw is executed with indirect flipping of the coin via directly driving the cavity and allows controllable decoherence over circles in ps . because the walker is directly driven rather than the coin , photon number is no longer conserved , and the walker jumps between circles in ps ; however , a signature of quantum walking on circles in ps is evident in both the time - dependent phase distribution of the walker as well as via direct homodyne measurements to obtain the quadrature phase ( qp ) distribution for the walker .",
    "this signature is scaling of the standard deviation  @xmath0 ( which measures the walker s spreading ) that is linear in time  @xmath1 for the qw , and whose power decreases with increasing decoherence until attaining the classical rw scaling @xmath2 for full decoherence .",
    "this controllable decoherence is achieved by introducing a second low-@xmath3 resonator to obtain fast readout  @xcite .",
    "to understand the qw in ps , it is helpful to first understand the rw in ps . the walker is a mode of the resonator , hence is equivalent to a harmonic oscillator , which can be described by its position  @xmath4 and momentum  @xmath5 . if the oscillator s energy @xmath6 for unit mass and frequency  @xmath7 , then the oscillator follows a periodic circular trajectory of radius  @xmath8 in ps with physical oscillatory motion @xmath9 this oscillator",
    "can be modified to execute a rw on a circle in ps by periodically applying an impulse that causes it to rotate either clockwise along the circle in ps by angle  @xmath10 or counter - clockwise by the same amount , with the choice of @xmath11 strictly random .",
    "if  @xmath12 , @xmath13 , then the walker always remains on a ( perhaps rotating ) lattice on the circle with angular lattice spacing  @xmath10 .",
    "we refer to the coordinate in ps  @xmath14 as the walker s ` location ' in ps , and the coin flip randomness that determine clockwise vs counter - clockwise angular steps implies that the walker s location is indeterminate hence described by a distribution  @xmath15 .    in an _",

    "the walker s phase distribution on the circle is @xmath23 with  @xmath24 equally spaced values of @xmath25 . however , here the walker is following a circular trajectory in ps so the qw s hilbert space is @xmath26 , with @xmath27 a fock state ( @xmath28 eigenstate ) .",

    "the qp distribution is @xmath36 with @xmath37 the phase of a local oscillator . a convenient correspondence between the classical and quantum ps trajectory of the walker is provided by the wigner quasiprobability distribution @xmath38 whose marginal distributions are @xmath39 . our scheme for realizing the first experimental qw builds on the cavity qed quantum quincunx  @xcite , which alternately applies a coin flip hadamard gate @xmath40 for @xmath41 followed by a rotation of the walker s state in ps by @xmath11 with the sign depending on the coin state ( with @xmath42 for @xmath43/\\sqrt{2\\omega}$ ] ) : @xmath44 the initial state of the walker is a coherent state @xmath45 : @xmath46 and @xmath47 fig .",

    ", the sacrifice is that @xmath58\\neq0 $ ] , but for realistic circuit qed conditions , the qw on circles is ( surprisingly ) evident provided that the step - by - step @xmath57 pulse duration is judiciously chosen .",
    "the goal is to observe the spreading of the qw s phase distribution , and the signature of the qw is that this spread is linear in time : specifically the standard deviation for the phase distribution satisfies @xmath59 for the qw , whereas @xmath60 for the rw , and the qw can be tuned continuously from the rw by controlling decoherence .",
    "as phase is periodic , the usual root - mean - square approach to  @xmath0 is problematic ; instead we employ the holevo standard deviation  @xcite @xmath61 for @xmath62 with respect to any phase distribution @xmath63 ( [ eq : phasedist ] ) .",
    "the holevo standard deviation is equivalent to the root - mean - square definition for small spreading on the circle , and @xmath64 naturally quantifies dispersion over all @xmath65@xcite .",
    "thus , for sufficiently short times ( less than the time that phase distribution spreads over a significant fraction of the circle in ps ) , if the relation between phase spreading on the circle with time is a power law , then @xmath66 with  @xmath67 for the qw and @xmath68 for the rw .",

    "it is possible to vary the frequency of the hadamard pulse rather than its duration . for large step number  @xmath101",
    ", the photon number distribution is found numerically to approximate @xmath114 and the width of the photon number distribution @xmath115 is closely approximated by @xmath116 in the numerical simulations .",
    "thus , number spreading is negligible , and the walker can be regarded as indeed being concentrated in the locality of one circle in ps  @xcite . as the walker s initial state is a coherent state with a poissonian number distribution , the fact that the width remains poissonian , and the amplitude is relatively constant , indicates that the initially well localized walker continues to be localized with respect to amplitude in the phase space over time .",
    "we observe from numerical simulations that the walker s location in phase space is effectively localized to a circle in phase space with radial width given by  ( [ eq : deltan ] ) . here",

    "the evolution of the joint walker+coin system is governed by the effective hamiltonian ( [ eq : heff ] ) .",
    "there are five terms on the right - hand side of this hamiltonian .",
    "let us understand each term and its effect on the dynamics to see why the walker is localized to a circle in phase space .    1 .",
    "the first term involves @xmath117 , which is responsible for entangling the evolution of the coin and the walker , effectively to make the walker evolve clockwise or counterclockwise at constant amplitude with the orientation entangled with the state of the coin .",
    "the second and third terms involve the operators @xmath118 and @xmath28 , respectively , which correspond to energies , hence frequencies , for the coin and walker .",
    "the fourth term , involving @xmath119 , is responsible for the hadamard coin flip and is proportional to the rabi frequency , which is itself proportional to the pulsed driving field  @xmath76  ( [ eq : rabi ] ) .",
    "4 .   the fifth term is a displacement involving the operator  @xmath120 , which pushes the walker off the circle , and is proportional to @xmath76 .    in making the quantum walk work ,",
    "the goal is to make the rabi frequency  @xmath89 large but keep @xmath76 small in order to flip the coin but minimally shift the walker from the circle .",
    "we have been able to simultaneously achieve the two conditions of large rabi frequency and small displacement . by meeting these two conditions ,",
    "the evolution is closely approximated by the unitary evolution @xmath121 for the quantum walk on circles in phase space  @xcite , with @xmath122 the size of the displacements from the circle .",

    "we have introduced the following protocol to implement the qw on circles in ps using circuit qed .",
    "( i )  solve the schrdinger equation from @xmath99 to @xmath100 , to obtain the mean photon number @xmath97 from which the sequence @xmath162 and @xmath163 are obtained .",
    "( ii )  prepare a high - q resonator in its vacuum state ( by simply cooling ) .",
    "( iii )  when the vacuum state is prepared , inject a microwave field with a gaussian pulse shape and temporal width @xmath164 in order to prepare the high - q resonator in a coherent state @xmath165 .",
    "( iv ) after @xmath166 , implement the hadamard pulse on the cpb by injecting a square pulse of frequency @xmath79 into resonator  b over time scale @xmath108 for step @xmath49 .",
    "( v ) terminate the external driving of the resonator to allow free evolution over time scale @xmath93 .",
    "( vi )  repeat steps ( iv ) and ( v )  @xmath101 times .",
    "( vii )  perform full tomography on resonator  b by performing homodyne measurement over many values of @xmath167 and use standard inversion technique on the data .    in circuit qed ,",
    "the amplifier thermal noise is significant , with more thermal photons present than the mean resonator photon number  @xcite .",
    "however the signal qp distribution and full wigner function can be obtained from the resultant homodyne detection statistics by convolving the readout with a thermal function ( which is a gaussian mixture of gaussian states centered at the ps origin ) . the spread of the convolution is determined by the mean thermal photon number , which is typically 20 .    the result is expected to be noisy quadrature phase readout , but repetition will yield , on average , the desired linearity of @xmath168 vs @xmath169 .",
    "we can use a filter algorithm  @xcite which takes the inversion formula for the measured radon transform of the wigner function with thermal noise and reconstruct the wigner function of the corresponding noiseless signal .",
    "hence we can achieve the noiseless phase distribution and qp distribution with the wigner function of the noiseless signal .",
    "vs  @xmath101 ( the number of the steps ) to @xmath170 with fixed pulse duration @xmath171 for ( a ) phase distribution on the circle in ps and ( b ) qp distribution for the classical random walk ( solid line ) and the qw ( red dots ) with @xmath104 , @xmath105 and typical system parameters @xmath172 mhz . in comparison ,",
    "the blue dotted lines are for the qw with adaptive pulse durations , which breaks down after 15 steps . ]",
    "we have shown that the qw on circles in ps can be implemented via circuit qed with and without open systems effects using realistic parameters and find that the signature of the qw is evident under those conditions .",
    "moreover full tomography may not be required because direct homodyne measurements over few quadratures reveal an unambiguous qw signature , and the rw can controllably emerge by tuning decoherence .",
    "our scheme shows how a qw with just one walker can be implemented in a realistic system for the first time , and controllable decoherence can be performed thereby allowing continuous tunability between the quantum and classical regimes .",
    "our scheme allows only a finite number of steps before the quadratic enhancement in phase spreading breaks down . as the phase step @xmath10 must be strictly greater than @xmath173 , the number of steps @xmath101 has an upper bound because of the desire to avoid wrap - around effects ( the walker going around the circle ) , then @xmath174 .",
    "therefore , @xmath175 provides an upper bound on @xmath101 .",
    "hence the number of steps has an upper bound that is determined by @xmath127 .",
    "if the mean number of photons in the resonator is increased , so is the allowed number of steps .",
