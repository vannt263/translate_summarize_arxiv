    "poor groups of galaxies , such as the local group are the most common environment for galaxies .",
    "rosat observations indicate that approximately half of all nearby groups of galaxies contain a diffuse , x - ray emitting ` intragroup medium ' analogous to the intracluster medium in rich clusters ( mulchaey 2000 ) .",
    "recently it has been realized that the intragroup medium may hold important clues into the formation and evolution of groups ( see for example , dav et al , these proceedings ) .",
    "numerical simulations indicate that in the absence of non - gravitational heating , the relationships between x - ray luminosity ( l@xmath0 ) , x - ray temperature ( t ) and optical velocity dispersion ( @xmath1 ) are expected to be similar for groups and clusters .",
    "the true nature of the scaling relationships for groups and clusters has proved to be a very controversial topic .",
    "for example , different authors have reached vastly different conclusions about the relationship between the optical velocity dispersion @xmath1 and the x - ray luminosity l@xmath0 .",
    "previous work has found either a similar ( zabludoff @xmath2 mulchaey 1998 ) or a more shallow ( helsdon @xmath2 ponman 2000 ; mahdavi et al .",
    "2000 ) relation for groups than for clusters .",
    "several explanations for a shallower group slope have been proposed including the possibility that individual galaxy halos contribute significantly to the x - ray luminosity of groups ( mahdavi et al . 2000 ) .",
    "most studies of the l@xmath0-@xmath1 relationship for groups have been based on velocity dispersions determined from only 3 or 4 of the brightest group members .",
    "simulations indicate that when small numbers of galaxies are used , the velocity dispersion does not trace the group mass ( dav et al . , these proceedings ) . we have embarked on a study to measure velocities for more group members and therefore obtain accurate dispersions for a large number of groups .",
    "our sample contains 20 groups of galaxies observed with fiber spectrographs at the 2.5 m telescope at las campanas observatory and the 3.5 m wiyn telescope ( zabludoff & mulchaey 1998 ; zimer et al .",
    "the x - ray properties of these groups have been derived from rosat pspc data ( mulchaey et al . 2001 ) .",
    "fourteen of these groups are detected in the rosat images . from the fiber spectroscopy , we measure velocities for typically @xmath3 1550 group members .",
    "these numbers are high enough to derive reliable velocity dispersions ( dav et al .",
    ", this proceedings ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the resulting l@xmath0-@xmath1 relationship we derive ( data points ) , with various other fits to the l@xmath0-@xmath1 relationship found in the literature .",
    "a summary of the various published l@xmath0-@xmath1 relationships is also given in table 1 .",
    "the @xmath4 @xmath5 panel in figure 1 shows the best fit to our cluster and group data using a parametric bootstrap technique ( lubin @xmath2 bahcall 1993 ) :    @xmath6    while for the cluster data alone ( mushotzky & scharf 1997 ) , we derive : @xmath7 within the errors , these fits are in agreement with each other and with the earlier results of mulchaey @xmath2 zabludoff ( 1998 ) ( see table 1 ) . given the small number of groups in our sample ,",
    "we have not attempted to fit the group data alone . however , a visual inspection of figure 1 suggests the group + cluster fit adequately describes the groups . in the @xmath4 @xmath8 panel we compare our data with fits in xue @xmath2 wu ( 2000 ) .",
    "their group + cluster fit is consistent with our result within the errors .",
    "the @xmath9 @xmath5 panel shows the best fit slopes for groups only from mahdavi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and helsdon & ponman ( 2000 ) .",
    "it is immediately obvious that the mahdavi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) fit is inconsistent with our data and can not be correct for groups in general .",
    "the helsdon @xmath2 ponman ( 2000 ) group fit is consistent with our group + cluster fit .",
    "however , helsdon @xmath2 ponman ( 2000 ) claim to find a significant difference between the l@xmath0-@xmath1 relation for groups and the relation for clusters .",
    "despite finding similar slopes for groups , we reach a different conclusion than helsdon @xmath2 ponman ( 2000 ) because there are significant differences in the cluster samples used in each survey .",
    "helsdon @xmath2 ponman ( 2000 ) use the white et al .",
    "( 1997 ) cluster sample ( see the @xmath9 @xmath8 panel in figure 1 ) , which has a considerably steeper l@xmath0-@xmath1 relation than the mushotzky @xmath2 scharf ( 1997 ) clusters ample we use ( white et al . 1997 : l@xmath0 @xmath10 @xmath1@xmath11 , mushotzky @xmath2 scharf 1997 : l@xmath0 @xmath10 @xmath1@xmath12 ) .",
    "the reason for the differences in these cluster samples is not apparent .",
    "it is clear , however , that these differences must be understood before any strong conclusions can be made regarding differences in the l@xmath0-@xmath1 relationship of groups and clusters .",
    ".the l@xmath0 - @xmath1 relation fits [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "there is still considerable debate about the nature of the l@xmath0 - @xmath1 relationship for groups and clusters .",
    "some of the discrepancies in the literature may be due to poorly determined @xmath1 s and/or l@xmath0 s .",
    "in many studies , the @xmath1 s are quite uncertain because they were derived from only the three or four brightest group members .",
    "the l@xmath0 measurements may also be uncertain because of the low signal - to - noise of most rosat images and contamination from other sources .",
    "* low - mass groups have many members if the luminosity function is sampled down to sufficiently low luminosities . *",
    "robust velocity dispersions for groups require at least @xmath3 1015 velocity measurements .",
    "* strong conclusions about differences in the l@xmath0 - @xmath1 relationship for groups and clusters can not be reached at the present time because of differences in the various cluster samples . *",
    "the uncertainties in the various scaling relationships suggest that it may be somewhat premature at this time to draw strong conclusions about the need for additional heating mechanisms in groups .",
