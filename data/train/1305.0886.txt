    "near - infrared  observation of young core - collapse snrs in the galactic plane is an invaluable tool for understanding many interesting phenomena associated with core - collapse supernova explosions .",
    "iron is the end product of the stellar nucleosynthetic processes with relatively small ( 7.90 ev ) ionization potential , which renders near - infrared  observations particularly useful for studying the distribution and kinematics of ejecta from deep layers of a progenitor star and those of circumstellar material from its later evolutionary phases prior to the explosion , along with interstellar shocks , while suffering less extinction effect than the visual or x - rays .",
    "an enlightening illustration is the heavily extinquished ( @xmath3 @xmath4 13 mag ) young core - collapse snr , the likely remains of the historical supernova explosion in sn 386 at @xmath1 5 kpc distance @xcite , of which recent  observations have revealed several pertinent features .",
    "according to the results of @xcite and @xcite ,  is filled with bright near - infrared  emission originating from both the shocked ejecta and circumstellar material scattered around the entire remnant . in its inner part ,",
    "knotty  emission with significant (  1,000 ) doppler shifts is prominent without any other bright elements , indicating that the majority of the iron knots therein originate deep inside its progenitor . near",
    "its northwestern boundary lie knotty filaments of  emission , reminiscent of bubbly iron ejecta . the most conspicuous near - infrared  feature in",
    ", however , is its southwestern shell which is in fact the brightest near - infrared emission ever detected among all galactic snrs .",
    "the shell is thick and prominent in radio , x - ray and mid - infrared emission too @xcite .",
    "although all these are suggestive that the southwestern shell is a rare example of shocked supernova ejecta interacting with shocked circumstellar material , the origin and nature of this unique feature are uncertain .    one efficient way to investigate the  emission of the southwestern shell of  is to obtain broadband two - dimensional integral - field spectra of the entire emission which can provide both spectral and spatial information simultaneously .",
    "in this paper , we report the results of such observations using our own instrument the florida image slicer for infrared cosmology and astrophysics ( fisica ) .",
    "we describe our instrument setup and observations in   2 , followed by results of the observations (   3 ) and discussions focused on shock modelling of multiple near - infrared  line emission (   4 ) .",
    "we summarize our results in   5 .",
    "the instrument setup used for the observations we report in this paper is a combination of florida multi - object imaging near - infrared grism observational spectrometer ( flamingos ) and fisica .",
    "the former is a facility instrument at the kitt peak national observatory mayall 4  m telescope .",
    "one unique feature of this instrument is a small multi - object spectrograph ( mos ) dewar , separated from its main dewar , dedicated for cycling multi - object slit masks @xcite .",
    "we replaced the mos dewar with fisica which is an image slicer - based integral - field unit composed of three monolithic mirror arrays @xcite .",
    "fisica was developed by some of the authors of this paper as an accessory module for flamingos , and the combination of flamingos and fisica provides an unprecedentedly large integral - field of view of @xmath1 16  @xmath5 33  in the near - infrared regime .",
    "this setup is uniquely ideal for studying kinematics and chemistry of extended objects in the galactic plane , such as the  emission of the southwestern shell of  as we report here .",
    "the observations took place on 2006 june 17 and 18 using the @xmath6-band grism of flamingos , which covers the @xmath1 1.01.8 @xmath7 m range populated with many  emission lines with @xmath8 @xmath9 1,300 spectral resolving power .",
    "we observed three bright  clumps ( which we call clump  1 , 2 , and 3 ) within the southeastern shell of originally detected in the  1.644 @xmath7 m narrow - band imaging observations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see figure  [ fig_limg ] ) .",
    "we followed each exposure of 300 seconds toward the clumps with the same exposure toward nearby sky without any apparent  emission in order to subtract out sky background emission ( including oh lines ) .",
    "the total on - source integration times were 1,500 , 2,100 , and 900 seconds for clump 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively , and the same integration times were used for sky observations . after flat fielding , we obtained wavelength solutions using henear arc spectra , and used the standard star of sao 187086 ( g6v ) for telluric calibration @xcite .",
    "the astrometric solutions of the obtained data cubes are consistent with the known positions of stars located inside the integral fields of the clumps .",
    "figure  [ fig_limg ] presents pure  ( 1.644 ) line images of clumps 1 , 2 , and 3 , together with those of  ( 1.083 ) and  ( 1.257 and 1.534 ) of clump 1 . to construct the line images",
    ", we measure the intensities of the line transitions at every spaxel by fitting their profiles with a gaussian function .",
    "the  ( 1.644 ) line images of the three clumps show extended ( @xmath10 25 ) elongated structures along the southwestern shell of .",
    "for the brightest clump  1 , in addition to the 1.644  transition , we also detect significant emission of  from the transitions at 1.257 and 1.534 .",
    "the images of the latter transitions closely resemble that of the former , with correlation coefficients of 0.94 ( 1.256 vs. 1.644  images ) and 0.95 ( 1.534 vs. 1.644  images ) .",
    "we also detect  ( 1.083 ) line emission from clump 1 . although faint , its peak position is coincident with those of the  lines , and it appears to extend in the same direction as the extension of the  images .",
    "figures  [ fig_sp]a and 2b show @xmath6-band spectra of clumps 1 , 2 , and 3 integrated over the entire region of each clump . as in figure",
    "[ fig_sp ] , they are exclusively dominated by  transitions , and in total we identify 12  transitions .",
    "the only line which is detected other than the  lines is  ( 1.083 ) from clump 1 .",
    "table  [ tab_obs ] contains the details of the detected line transitions including their relative intensities .",
    "the detected lines do not show any apparent doppler shifts , which is consistent with the results of @xcite around this area of the snr , indicating that their motions are mostly tangential .",
    "however , in the profile of the  ( 1.644 ) transition from clump 1 ( figure  [ fig_sp]c ) , we identify an additional velocity component which we call the southeastern blueshifted high - velocity feature ( or se - bhvf ) .",
    "the extension of se - bhvf is @xmath1 10  and its peak position is located at @xmath1 15  from the main peak position of clump 1 in the northeastern direction ( figure  [ fig_limg ] ) . using a two - velocity component gaussian fit of the profile , we estimate the radial velocity of se - bhvf to be 440 @xmath11 100 , highly blueshifted from the systematic velocity ( @xmath1245 ) of g11.2@xmath00.3 @xcite .",
    "the integrated intensity of se - bhvf is @xmath13 2  % of the main component .    because the two  transitions at 1.257 and 1.644  detected in clump  1 share the same upper level , their intrinsic intensity ratio is determined by their atomic parameters .",
    "we compare the observed ratio with the intrinsic ratio of 1.36 expected from the atomic parameters of   @xcite and compute the extinction toward the source using the extinction curve of grains in the milky way with @xmath14 = 3.1 @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig_par]b shows a visual extinction ( @xmath3 ) map of clump  1 which presents two - dimensional distribution of the extinction in the clump .",
    "its mean extinction is @xmath3 = 16 @xmath11 1 mag , but varies somewhat significantly within the clump between 12 and 20 mag and increases in the southwestern directions where clumps 2 and 3 are located . for the extinctions toward clumps 2 and 3 , we only calculate their average extinctions of @xmath3 = 18 @xmath11 1 ( clump 2 ) and 20 @xmath11 1 ( clump 3 ) mag due to relatively weak intensities of their  1.257  transitions . the internal extinction distribution within clump 1 and",
    "the increased extinctions toward clumps 2 and 3 show a tendency that the overall extinction toward g11.2@xmath00.3 in this area increases along the southern direction , indicating potential existence of a foreground or circumstellar gas cloud there .",
    "the extinction toward clump 1 is consistent with a sn at 5 kpc being visible to the naked eye in ad 386 .",
    "the average extinction ( @xmath3 = 16 mag ) of clump 1 is higher than the extinction ( @xmath3 = 13 mag ) previously estimated at the intensity peak position @xcite , although their observed transition ratios of  1.257 to 1.644   are similar within errors ( 0.303 @xmath11 0.019 for the former and 0.314 @xmath11 0.010 for the latter ) , simply due to the different atomic parameters and resulting intrinsic intensities used to estimate the extinctions @xcite .",
    "we also use the distribution of the transition ratio of  1.533 to 1.644   to obtain two - dimensional distribution of the electron density in clump 1 ( figure  [ fig_par]c ) .",
    "we solve the rate equations of 16 levels of fe@xmath15 using the transition probabilities and collision strengths in the literature @xcite at the temperature of 5,000  k. as in figure  [ fig_par]c , the distribution of the electron density in clump 1 is totally different from that of the  1.644 line intensities with their peaks located at different positions .",
    "the average electron density of clump 1 is 9,400 @xmath11 2,100 @xmath2 , while those of the other two clumps are 8,900 @xmath11 2,800 and 4,700 @xmath11 1,000 @xmath2 for clumps 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "the near - infrared @xmath6-band spectra of the observed clumps are dominated by  lines  only weak emission of  is detected other than  lines in figure  [ fig_sp ] .",
    "one notable feature is the lack of correlation between the distribution of the  line intensities and that of the electron number density ( figure  [ fig_par ] ) , which indicates that the  ratio distribution is largely independent of the line intensity distribution . in order to investigate this more thoroughly , we compare the radial distribution of the two quantities , i.e. ,  1.644  @xmath7 m line intensity and the  line ratio , along the peak position of clump  1 ( figure  [ fig_par ] ) by applying boxcar average of 5 .",
    "figure  [ fig_mo ] shows that the radial distributions of the two quantities are clearly dissimilar : the  1.644  @xmath7 m line intensity peaks at the middle of the clump and decays both inward and outward with @xmath1 4  fwhm , while the  ratio distribution is almost flat with a tendency of slight increase toward the outer edge of the clump .",
    "we model the radial profiles of the  1.534 and 1.644  line intensities and their ratio for a snr shock penetrating into dense ambient medium using a shock code ( figure  [ fig_mo ] ) .",
    "the code that we use was developed by @xcite and improved by @xcite .",
    "we have updated the atomic parameters of  forbidden lines , using recent values from @xcite and @xcite for the radiative transition rates and the collisional strengths , respectively .",
    "we calculate the level populations of the lowest 16 levels in four terms ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 ) of fe@xmath15 and the intensities of the lines resulting from the transitions among them .",
    "the line emissivities of a fluid element are calculated following its trajectory from the shock front until it cools down to 1,000 k , and are used to compute the line intensities and their ratios .",
    "we assume that incoming h atoms are fully ionized by radiative precursor .",
    "the code , however , does not calculate the emission from radiative precusor itself .",
    "this is acceptable for  lines because fe atoms in the pre - shock gas may be mostly locked up to grains , which are liberated when the grains are destroyed in the post - shock flow .",
    "the  1.534 and 1.644 @xmath7 m line brightnesses and their ratio are functions of shock speed ( @xmath20 ) , preshock density ( @xmath21 ) , and preshock magnetic field strength ( @xmath22 ) perpendicular to the shock front in general .",
    "we will present some general characteristics of the  emission from radiative shocks using the shock code in the forthcoming paper ( koo et al . in preparation ) .",
    "overall the preshock density is well constrained by the  ratio .",
    "the average  ratio of clump 1 is @xmath23 ( table  [ tab_obs ] ) , indicating the average postshock electron density of @xmath24  @xmath2 ( see   3 )",
    ". this value should be much higher than the uncompressed preshock density for a radiative shock . for shock speeds of 80250  and",
    "@xmath25  , the observed ratio implies @xmath26500 @xmath2 . for @xmath27",
    ", it becomes @xmath28300 @xmath2 for the same shock speed range .",
    "we adopt 10 , which is the median value of the maximum magnetic field strength for diffuse clouds @xcite .",
    "we take the shock speed to explain the observed line emission : if the velocity is considerably lower , e.g. ,  50 , we may expect to see h@xmath29 emission from molecular shocks instead of bright  emission from atomic radiative shocks . if the velocity is siginificantly larger , e.g. , @xmath10 250 , the expected brightness normal to the shock front becomes brighter than the observed one , i.e. , 12 @xmath30 ergs @xmath31 s@xmath32 sr@xmath32 , which is the intensity of the bright structure of clump  1 obtained by @xcite after being smoothed to the beamsize ( @xmath33 ) of the current observation and dereddended using @xmath34  mag .",
    "note that the observed brightness is the integrated intensity along the line of sight and also beam - diluted .",
    "the brightness along the line of sight is much larger than the brightness normal to the shock front in general , so that it is not straightforward to give more stringent constraints without more complicated and detailed shock model calculations .",
    "we perform a shock model calculation of the observed radial profiles assuming solar abundance @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig_mo ] , the red - solid and red - dashed lines represent the normalized  1.644  intensity and the  line ratio , respectively , for a spherically symmetric shock of 130  propagating into an ambient medium of @xmath35  @xmath2 . the peak intensity of  1.644  line profile is 8 @xmath5 @xmath36 ergs @xmath31 s@xmath32 sr@xmath32 . note that these are profiles integrated along the line of sight and beam - diluted . for comparison",
    ", we also show the normalized  1.644  intensity profile ( black - dotted line ) which is free of the beam dilution effect , where we can identify a sharp intensity contrast caused by a thin shock front . as in figure",
    "[ fig_mo ] , our shock model fits the  ratio very well , whereas it does the  1.644  intensity profile somewhat poorly .",
    "the observed intensity ( filled circles ) is much fainter than the modelled one ( red - solid line ) at @xmath37 and the width of the observed shell is much greater than what is modelled .",
    "these discrepancies imply that the structure is not spherically symmetric , with local enhancement of high - density medium in the region , and also that there may be multiple filaments inside the beam .",
    "we can fit the observed intensity profile and the peak brightness readily using multiple filaments of finite sizes .",
    "for example , the green - solid line in figure  [ fig_mo ] shows the modelled intensity profile when there are three filaments of 1.7 pc size separated by 0.030.04 pc from each other , and it is in a good agreement with the observed values .",
    "the current model is probably not a unique model for the radial profile , but multiple filaments seem to be unavoidable .",
    "a possible scenario for the origin of such multiple filaments is an episodic mass loss from the progenitor of   to the southeast - northwest direction .",
    "the similar distribution of  in clump 1 ( figure  [ fig_limg ] ) also agrees with the circumstellar origin of the main  emission of the clump , excluding se - bhvf ( see below ) .",
    "the dereddended line ratio of  1.083 to  1.644 @xmath7 m is @xmath1 0.50 , which is comparable to @xmath1 0.59 previously observed in rcw  103 @xcite .",
    "the three  clumps that we observe here are surrounded by hot x - ray gas ( figure  [ fig_limg ] ) .",
    "the density of the x - ray emitting gas is 13 @xmath2 , if we simply divide its ionization time scale @xmath38 = 6.7 @xmath5 10@xmath39 s @xmath2 by the snr age of 1,600 years @xcite .",
    "the temperature of the x - ray emitting gas is 0.58 kev , so that its pressure becomes @xmath40 = 1.8 @xmath5 10@xmath41 @xmath2 k , where @xmath42 is the boltzmann constant . for comparison ,",
    "the average electron densities of clumps are 4,7009,400 @xmath2 . using the characteristics temperature of 5,000 k ,",
    "we get the ionized gas pressure @xmath43 = 0.470.94 @xmath5 10@xmath41 @xmath2 k , which is about 1/4 to 1/2 of the pressure from the x - rays , indicating that the ionization fraction of  emitting gas is low ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the total gas pressure , neglecting he , is @xmath44 , where @xmath45 , is the mean ionization fraction .",
    "this gives @xmath460.34 , consistent with our previous results from the shock model calculations    the southeastern shell of g11.2@xmath00.3 has been detected by spitzer mid - infrared irac 38 @xmath7 m and mips 24 @xmath7 m images @xcite . comparing the distributions of the mid - infrared images with those of the near - infrared  and h@xmath29 line images @xcite , the brightest clump  1 is less pronounced in the mid - infrared images , and a small molecular cloud located at @xmath1 1  southwest from clump  1 ( h@xmath29-pk1 in @xcite ) is prominent in the spitzer irac images .",
    "this is consistent with the classification of g11.2@xmath00.3 ( h@xmath29-pk1 ) with molecular shocks by the ratios of the irac intensities @xcite , and the spitzer mid - infrared spectrum , obtained at the position of this molecular cloud , shows a wealth of h@xmath29 pure rotational and ionic lines as well as bright dust continuum @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the position of the molecular cloud is outside the  clumps and not covered by our observations . for the spitzer mips",
    "24 @xmath7 m emission of clump  1 , although we expect a significant contribution from  24.52 and 25.99 @xmath7 m lines , it is not straightforward to determine the relative contributions from these ionic lines and dust continuum , due to various uncertainties in comparing the model spectrum to the observed brightness .",
    "future imaging spectroscopic observations are needed for detailed study of the mid - infrared emission .",
    "an interesting finding of our observations is the detection of se - bhvf which is doppler shifted by @xmath0440 @xmath11 100 km s@xmath32 around the northeastern corner of clump  1 ( figures  [ fig_limg ] and [ fig_sp]c ) . assuming that se - bhvf is located at the boundary of 2  radius of the snr shell with its projected distance of 1.7  from the center , its de - projected expanding velocity is @xmath1  @xmath0900  km  s@xmath32 with respect to the + 45  systematic velocity of  @xcite",
    "this expanding velocity is comparable to the velocities of the highly blueshifted ( @xmath1 @xmath01000 km s@xmath32 ) ejecta knots previously detected around the center of  @xcite , which is suggestive that se - bhvf has the same origin as the central knots .",
    "if  is indeed the remnant of the supernova explosion in ad 386 @xcite , the observed ejecta velocities indicate that they have been considerably decelerated .",
    "the existence of se - bhvf in clump 1 of the southeastern shell is consistent with the previous interpretations that the sn ejecta in was expelled mainly in the southeast - northwest direction , given the existence of the northwestern filaments which are most likely of the ejecta origin @xcite .",
    "we perform near - infrared ( 1.01.8 @xmath7 m ) integral - field spectroscopic observations of the southeastern shell of the young core - collapse snr g11.2@xmath00.3 using our own instrument setup that provides an unprecedented integral - field size in the wavebands .",
    "the shell is known to have brightest near - infrared  emission of all galactic snrs , and is presumed to be a unique mixture of progenitor s circumstellar material and supernova ejecta .",
    "our data cube populated with multiple  transitions makes it possible to study the detailed two - dimensional distributions of the line intensities , velocities , electron densities , and extinction .",
    "based on this information , we compare the observed results with those predicted by snr shock models and obtain shock parameters in this region of the snr .",
    "the observed properties of the brightest clump can be explained by multiple shocked thin filaments of circumstellar material .",
    "this , together with the discovery of the faint high - velocity component , suggests that the southeastern shell of  is indeed a mixture of circumstellar material and ejecta , with the former being the dominant component .",
    "future studies with improved sensitivity and resolutions ( both spatial and spectral ) are needed to understand how the two components are interacting .",
