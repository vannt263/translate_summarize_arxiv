    "the one dimensional cable model is treated in standard textbooks of neurophysiology to model the electrical conduction of non - isopotential excitable cells . in particular",
    "it describes the spatial and the temporal dependence of trans - membrane potential @xmath0 along the axial @xmath1 direction of a cylindrical nerve cell segment .",
    "the membrane behaviour is summarized by an electrical circuit with an axial internal resistance @xmath2 , and a transmembrane capacitance @xmath3 and a transmembrane resistance @xmath4 in parallel , connecting the inner part to the outside @xcite .",
    "external axial resistance could be eventually included .",
    "transmembrane potential is generated by ionic concentration gradient across the membrane , and is maintained non null at rest ( no current ) by a combination of passive and active cell mechanisms .",
    "equivalent models can in fact be derived from the nernst - planck equation for electro - diffusive motion of ions .",
    "cell excitation can be caused by electro stimulation of the membrane .",
    "the consequent variation in transmembrane potential is transmitted along the cell segment .",
    "the resulting differential equation for the trans - membrane potential takes the form of a standard diffusion equation with an extra a term to account leakage of ions out of the membrane , it results in a decay of the electric signal in space and in time : @xmath5 @xmath6 and @xmath7 are space and time constants related to the membrane resistance and capacitance per unit length , see e.g. @xcite . for simplicity in the rest of this work , following @xcite",
    ", we will use the dimensionless scaled variables @xmath8 and @xmath9 , so that we consider the equation @xmath10    some interesting quantities to neurophysiology are connected to first kind boundary condition ( the signal problem ) and second kind boundary condition problems .",
    "signal problem is interesting to understand how the system evolves when excited at one end with a specific potential profile , second kind boundary condition problem is interesting because can be related to the profile of a current injected across the membrane .    in signalling problems the cable",
    "is considered of semi - infinite length ( @xmath11 ) , initially quiescent for @xmath12 and excited for @xmath13 at the accessible end ( @xmath14 ) with a given input in membrane potential @xmath15 .",
    "the solution can be derived via the laplace transform ( lt ) approach : @xmath16 and the lt of the solution results @xmath17    relevant cases are impulsive input @xmath18 and unit step input @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 denote the dirac and the heaviside functions , respectively .",
    "the solutions corresponding to these inputs can be obtained by lt inversion @xcite and read in our notation @xmath22 and @xmath23 we refer to @xmath24 to as the fundamental solution or the green function for the signalling problem of the ( linear ) cable equation ( eq.[linear - scaled ] ) , whereas to @xmath25 to as the step response .",
    "as known , the green function is used in the time convolution integral to represent the solution corresponding to any given input @xmath26 as follows @xmath27 the spatial variance associated to this model is known to evolve linearly in time .",
    "if we consider an impulse or a step current injected at some point @xmath28 the problem is subjected to the following boundary conditions , specifically @xmath29 or @xmath30    we consider the adimensional current @xmath31 and put it to unity for convenience . appling the impulse in @xmath14 the lt reduces to @xmath32 the green function and the step response function ( when a step current is applied in @xmath14 ) reads , respectively , @xmath33 and @xmath34    we emphasize that in this standard case the green function @xmath35 is equal to the green function for the cauchy problem , name it @xmath36 , for an infinite cable up to constant coefficients .",
    "the motion of ions along the nerve cells is conditionated by this model , that predicts a mean square displacement of diffusing ions that scales linearly with time . by the way significative deviations from linear behaviour have been measured by experiments .",
    "a relevant medical and biological example is the anomalous subdiffusion in neuronal dendritic spines .",
    "particularly appropriate systems are spiny purkenje cell dendrites characterized by both spiny and not spiny branches .",
    "spiny branches are in fact characterized by subdiffusive dynamics , while not spiny branches are not .",
    "the spatial variance of a diffusing inert tracer ( concentration of ) in spiny branches evolves as a sub - linear power law of time , and the diffusion with smaller values of the power exponent is associated to higher spine density @xcite , as spines behave as a trap for the diffusing molecules .",
    "anomalous subdiffusion can be modelled in several ways introducing some fractional component into the classical cable model .",
    "the fractional cable model developed in this section is defined by replacing the first order time derivative in eq.([linear - scaled ] ) with a fractional derivative of order @xmath37 of caputo type @xcite , @xcite .",
    "@xmath38    the solutions of the most relevant boundary problems ( signal problem , cauchy problem , second kind boundary problem @xcite ) are explicitly calculated in integral form containing wright functions .",
    "thanks to the variability of the parameter @xmath39 , the corresponding solutions are expected to better describe the qualitative behaviour of the membrane potential observed in experiments respect to the standard case @xmath40 .    from a mathematical point of view",
    "this model is a simple extension to fractional behaviour of the neuronal cable model and it turns to be in some special cases equivalent to the equation developed in a relevant study @xcite , which has been derived from a modified nernst - planck equation , with diffusion constant replaced by fractional derivatives of riemann - liouville type .",
    "other studies consider similar approaches @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , often concentrating on the initial value problem ( cauchy problem ) .",
    "we will see that beside the apparent simplicity our approach allows to reproduce at least qualitatively the main characteristics observed in experiments @xcite , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "further generalizations of this model introducing a second fractional time derivative to the shift term could be analysed in future , to refine the biological relevance of the model .",
    "the solution for the signal problem , derived by the authors of the present work , has been presented and accepted for publication in aip conference proceedings @xcite and is reported here for sake of completeness .",
    "the solution of the signalling problem can be derived via laplace transform , however the inversion of the lt solution for eq .",
    "( [ frac ] ) requires special effort because of the term @xmath41 .    when this term is not present , the resulting equation is the well known time fractional diffusion equation : @xmath42 for which the solutions of the corresponding cauchy and signalling problems have been derived in the 1990 s by mainardi in terms of 2 auxiliary wright functions ( of the second type ) @xcite . specifically for the signalling problem",
    "the general solution provided by mainardi in integral convolution form reads @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes the green function of the signalling problem of the fractional time diffusion equation ( eq.[frac - standard ] ) and @xmath45 is a particular case of the transcendental function known as wright function @xmath46}\\,,\\quad   \\lambda>-1 , \\ ; \\mu\\ge 0\\,.\\ ] ] this function , entire in the complex plane , is discussed extensively in the appendix f of mainardi s book @xcite where the interested reader can find the following relevant laplace transform pairs , rigorously derived by stankovi@xcite : @xmath47 here we have adopted an obvious notation to denote the juxtaposition of a locally integrable function of time @xmath48 with its laplace transform in @xmath49 with @xmath1 a positive parameter .",
    "it is worth to recall the distinction of the wright functions in first type ( @xmath50 ) and second type ( @xmath51 ) and , among the latter ones , the relevance of the two auxiliary functions introduced in @xcite : @xmath52 inter - related as @xmath53 .",
    "indeed the relevance of both the wright functions has been outlined by several authors in diffusion and stochastic processes .",
    "particular attention is due to the @xmath54-wright function ( also referred to as the mainardi function in @xcite ) that , since for @xmath55 reduces to @xmath56 , is considered a suitable generalization of the gaussian density , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "then the green function for the signalling problem of the time fractional diffusion equation ( eq.[frac - standard ] ) can be written in the original form provided in @xcite as @xmath57 where the superscript @xmath58 is added to distinguish the time fractional diffusion equation from our fractional cable equation , both depending on the order @xmath59 .    applying the laplace transform to eq.[frac ] with the boundary conditions required by the signalling problem , that is @xmath60 , @xmath61",
    ", we have : @xmath62 which is a second order equation in the variable @xmath28 with solution : @xmath63 because of the shift constant in the square root of the laplace transform in eq.[lt - cable ] , the inversion is no longer straightforward with the wright functions as it is in the time fractional diffusion equation ( eq.[frac - standard ] ) .",
    "consequently , we have overcome this difficulty recurring to the application of the efros theorem @xcite that generalizes the well known convolution theorem for laplace transforms . for sake of convenience",
    "let us hereafter recall this theorem , usually not so well - known in the literature .",
    "the efros theorem states that if we can write a laplace transform @xmath64 as : @xmath65 where the function @xmath66 has a known inverse laplace transform @xmath67 , the inverse laplace transform can be written in the form : @xmath68 where : @xmath69 in eq.[lt - cable ] , lt solution of our signalling problem , we thus have : @xmath70 and @xmath71 then , having @xmath72 , thanks to the standard convolution theorem of laplace transforms , we obtain : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the f - wright function , and @xmath75 is the solution in eq.[linsol ] of the standard cable equation ( eq.[linear - scaled ] ) .",

    "the cable model , fractional or linear , is used to describe subthreshold potentials , or passive potentials , associated to dendritic processes in neurons .",
    "the travelling potential is summed up in the center of the cell , called soma , and an action potential is produced when a threshold is exceeded .",
    "anomalous regimes of diffusion can then have a deep impact on the communication strength .",
    "diffusion results more anomalous , i.e. the fractional exponent @xmath39 decreases , with increasing spine density @xcite . decreasing spine density is characteristic of aging @xcite,@xcite , pathologies as neurological disorders @xcite and down s sindrome @xcite , then subdiffusive regimes are in some sense associated to a healthy condition .",
    "it has been suggested that increasing spine density should serve to compensate time delay of postsynaptic potentials along dendrites and to reduce their long time temporal attenuation @xcite .",
    "looking at our plotted solutions for the fractional cable equation when an impulsive potential is applied at the accessible end it can be noted from fig.[signal1 ] that peak high decreases more rapidly with decreasing @xmath39 at early times , viceversa is less suppressed at longer times , and the cross over time increases with decreasing @xmath39 .",
    "looking at the potential versus time it can also be noted that potential functions associated to lower @xmath39 last for longer time at appreciable intensity and arrive faster at early times with respect to the normal diffusion case ( @xmath40 ) . by the way , when a constant potential is applied at the accessible end we note from fig.[signal2 ] that the exponential suppression of the potential along the dendrite is reduced for high @xmath28 values with respect to normal diffusion .",
    "instead for small @xmath28 the potential results just slightly more suppressed in the sub - diffusion process . these behaviours can be noticed also for the other cases in fig.[cauchy ] and fig.[current ] - [ current2 ] .    from a mathematical point of view",
    "the efros theorem extends the concept of convolution as an integral form that is consistent with a subordination - type integral .",
    "however such integral form does not necessary connote a subordinated process , as it has been shown in literature for ggbm @xcite and in a more extended way in @xcite , but could also be interpreted as a consequence of the random nature of the media in which particles are diffusing .",
    "this model can be also read as a generalization of time fractional diffusion processes where mass is not conserved due to leakage .",
    "this approach naturally recover the solution for the time fractional case in the limit in which the leakage is put to zero in the integral forms .    in conclusion",
    "the presented fractional cable model satisfies the main biological features of the dendritic cell signalling problem . with respect to models solved as cauchy problem",
    ", our approach could include specific time dependent boundary conditions , which will allow to reconstruct with accuracy the expected signal at the soma if the model will result capable to predict real data behaviour .",
    "furthermore the solutions can be computed directly , i.e. calculating the integral associated , as well as by laplace transform inversion @xcite without any remarkable issue .",
