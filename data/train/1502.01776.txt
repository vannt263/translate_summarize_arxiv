    "<S> the physical origin of the bubbles is still under debate . </S>",
    "<S> the leading scenarios can be divided into two categories . </S>",
    "<S> one is the nuclear star forming activity similar to extragalactic starburst galaxies and the other is the past active galactic nucleus ( agn ) like activity of the galactic center supermassive black hole . in this paper , we propose that metal abundance measurements will provide an important clue to probe their origin . based on a simple spherically symmetric bubble model , we find that the generated metallicity and abundance pattern of the bubbles gas strongly depend on assumed star formation or agn activities . </S>",
    "<S> star formation scenarios predict higher metallicities and abundance ratios of [ o / fe ] and [ ne / fe ] than agn scenarios do because of supernovae ejecta . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the resultant abundance depends on the gamma - ray emission process because different mass injection histories are required for the different gamma - ray emission processes due to the acceleration and cooling time scales of non - thermal particles . </S>",
    "<S> future x - ray missions such as _ astro - h _ and _ athena _ will give a clue to probe the origin of the bubbles through abundance measurements with their high energy resolution instruments . </S>"
