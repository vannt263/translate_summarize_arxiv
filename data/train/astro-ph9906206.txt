    "it is of paramount importance to determine distances to external galaxies : such knowledge impacts both stellar and extragalactic astrophysics as well as cosmology and the structure of the universe including the derivation of the hubble constant ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "unfortunately the standard `` luminosity - calibrated '' methods of distance determination have not yet allowed an unambiguous determination of the hubble constant ( see the proceedings of `` the extragalactic distance scale '' stsci may 1996 symposium for an overview ) , and all luminosity based indicators are extinction and metallicity dependent in some way .",
    "thus ( new ) physical and geometric methods of distance determination are highly desirable and should be pursued wherever possible .",
    "sparks ( 1994 ) proposed that distances to external galaxies ( well in excess of the distance to the virgo cluster ) could be determined by means of supernova ( sn ) light echoes .",
    "the method is appealing as it is purely geometrical , does not need any secondary distance indicators or calibration and might be used to relate to luminosity distance indicators when applied to galaxies hosting cepheids and/or type ia supernovae ( sparks 1994 , 1996 ) .",
    "the technique requires high resolution imaging polarization observations of sn light echoes .",
    "a light echo is expected to be produced by scattering of the sn light by dust in the interstellar medium , and would be visible to the observer at some time after the supernova explosion ( due to light travel time effects ) .",
    "the evolution of such a feature is well understood ( e.g. chevalier 1986 ) and mathematically straightforward .",
    "to summarize , the light echo is a paraboloid at the focus of which the historical supernova lies .",
    "the observer looks down the axis , `` into '' the paraboloid . while the _ intensity _ distribution of the echo is likely to be complex , depending primarily on dust density , by contrast , the _ polarization _",
    "distribution should be simple .",
    "angular distance from the supernova is related to the scattering angle , and polarization depends simply on scattering angle , maximizing at @xmath1 scattering .",
    "hence at the intersection between the plane of the sky containing the supernova and the parabola , light is scattered at an angle of @xmath2 degrees and forms a ring in an image of the degree of polarization ( this light having the maximum degree of polarization ) .",
    "the linear diameter of the ring is @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the speed of light and @xmath5 is the time since the explosion , therefore , if @xmath6 , the angular diameter of the ring is measured , the distance @xmath7 is derived geometrically by @xmath8 .",
    "light echoes have been observed around sn 1987a ( crotts 1988 , sparks et al .",
    "1989 ) and sn 1991 t ( schmidt et al . 1994 ) . from the ground",
    "we would not expect to resolve light echoes around known historical supernovae in most cases . yet from the ground _ candidate _",
    "light echoes can be sought and identified by using imaging and , when appropriate , polarization criteria : a good light echo candidate shows optical emission at / near the site of the historical supernova , is blue in color , because of both the intrinsic `` blueness '' of the sn and the additional blueing introduced by the scattering process , and is polarized .",
    "the discovery of light echo candidates and subsequent confirmation either through ground  based spectroscopic observations , or direct space imaging polarimetry observations is an essential step in the process of enabling general geometric galaxy distance determinations by this technique .",
    "here we describe a program to search for candidate echoes via ccd imaging .",
    "sparks et al .",
    "( 1999 ) show how space imaging polarimetry can be used in the well known case of the sn 1991 t light echo .",
    "the region of maximum linear polarization emission can not be resolved yet due to the small time since the explosion and the distance to the galaxy .",
    "however , we give a distance estimate to sn 1991 t ( an upper limit of 15 mpc is found ) via simple modeling of the scattering process .    although the main objective of such a search program is to find light echoes and use them to determine distances , the photometric and spectroscopic data collected , together with the polarimetry , should also provide important information on the supernova environments in the host galaxy .",
    "more generally , what we learn about environments of different sn types in turn tells us something about the sn progenitor and the stellar populations of galaxies . in particular we think of sne of type ia whose",
    "star progenitor systems have not unambiguously been identified yet .",
    "a careful investigation of both circumstellar and interstellar environments of these sne may provide clues on the nature of their progenitors and in some instances allow to test some of the proposed pre - sn scenarios ( boffi & branch 1995 , branch et al .",
    "the identification of type ia sn star system progenitors is important ( among other reasons ) because the nature of the progenitors is connected to the use of these sne as distance indicators and to derive cosmological parameters ( perlmutter et al .",
    "1998 , riess et al .",
    "in fact to determine the mass and energy density of the universe from sne of type ia in the hubble diagram , the evolution with cosmic epoch of both the type ia sn rate and their luminosity function are relevant ; these functions depend on the nature of the progenitor systems .    in section 2",
    "the sample of galaxies is presented and we explain the selection criteria used .",
    "the observations are described and the analysis process is presented in section 3 .",
    "our results are summarized in section 4 where we discuss ( a ) the results from our search for candidate light echoes ; ( b ) some by - products of the present investigation in terms of sn environments and of sn star progenitors .",
    "conclusions and plans for future work are discussed in the last section .",
    "firstly all galaxies have been selected to be parent galaxies of historical supernovae . many host multiple sn events .",
    "second , echoes , if present , would be resolved with high resolution imaging using the hubble space telescope instrumentation , i.e. their angular size would be @xmath9 arcsec on the long distance scale ( i.e. , for a low value of the hubble s constant ) .",
    "this resulted in a total sample of ( north & south ) 172 galaxies , 211 supernovae . due to time , visibility and weather constraints , of these we observed 38 galaxies , hosting 64 supernovae .",
    "furthermore , for some , their distance is already well determined by means of normal type ia supernovae and cepheid variable stars ( e.g. ngc 5253 , ic 4182 ) , thus they are are already tied to traditional methods of distance determinations and can be used for comparisons between different methods . priority was given to such galaxies and to galaxies hosting multiple events .",
    "in other regards , our resulting sample is unbiassed and representative of the larger sample .",
    "the data presented in this paper were obtained in three observing runs : one at the 1 m jacobus kapteyn telescope ( jkt ) in la palma , canary islands , in october 1994 and two with efosc , at the 3.6 m cassegrain telescope at the european southern observatory , la silla , chile , respectively in march and may 1995 ( see tables 1a and 1b ) . in all runs b , v and r images were taken for each target .",
    "seventeen galaxies were observed with the 1 m jkt and a further 26 with the 3.6 m telescope of eso .",
    "all galaxies are listed , in order of increasing right ascension , in tables 1a and 1b , respectively for the jkt and the eso runs .",
    "both tables are structured as follows : the galaxy name ( ngc , ugc , ic , m ) is given in the first column , right ascension and declination follow , then the morphological type of the galaxy is listed in column 4 .",
    "the supernova(e ) is ( are ) given in the fifth column , followed by their offset with respect to the nucleus of the galaxy ( unless otherwise noted ) ; finally host galaxy recession velocity , date of observation , exposure times in b , v and r , respectively , are given ( from column 8 through 11 ) . in table 1b",
    "a letter `` p '' next to the exposure time indicates that polarization measurements were also taken .",
    "the polarization results will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the b and v bands are in the johnson system , the r in the cousins .    for the jkt observations ,",
    "only imaging observations were performed .",
    "a tek4 ccd detector was used .",
    "this is a high  resolution chip with @xmath10 pixels corresponding to a @xmath11 image scale .",
    "the ccd was used with a gain corresponding to @xmath12 electrons per ccd analog  to  digital unit ( adu ) , and the readout noise estimated from the variance of intensity values in the overscan region was measured to be @xmath13 electrons .",
    "seeing was measured to be @xmath14 fwhm typically .",
    "bias ( zero  exposures ) and flat field frames were taken at the beginning and end of each observing night .",
    "for the eso observations , both imaging and imaging polarization observations were obtained .",
    "we mounted four optical  quality polarizing filters utilizing hn38 polaroid and anti - reflection coated @xmath15 substrates at position angles @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 in the first filter wheel to be encountered by the light beam after passing through the aperture plate .",
    "the eso ccd no .",
    "26 was used as the detector .",
    "this is a high resolution tek detector with @xmath20 pixels corresponding to a @xmath21 image scale .",
    "the ccd was used with a gain corresponding to @xmath22 electrons per ccd adu , and the readout noise estimated from the variance of intensity values in the overscan region was measured to be @xmath23 electrons .",
    "the ccd saturates at @xmath24 electrons .",
    "seeing was measured to be @xmath25 fwhm typically .",
    "bias frames were taken at the beginning and end of each observing night and flat field exposures of the dome interior were also obtained .",
    "the analysis process primarily fell in three parts : firstly , we performed basic photometric calibration of the data , secondly we made high signal  to  noise images suitable to locate any interesting patches at the site of ( or close to ) the supernova , thirdly we performed photometric measurements of features visible in the sn environments .      first , following standard procedures , the images were debiassed and flat  fielded ( using iraf arithmetic routines )",
    ". then spatial registration of the images was performed . for each galaxy ,",
    "one image was taken as reference .",
    "then the iraf task imexam was used to measure the pixel coordinates of the peak intensity of an object ( or objects ) visible in all images ( and for all bands ) , using a centering algorithm . if the nucleus of the galaxy was not suitable , i.e. it was saturated , then the positions of typically three stars were located and taken as reference , otherwise the position of the galaxy nucleus itself was used .",
    "all images of each galaxy were then registered with linear shifts and linear interpolation of fluxes ( imshift or imlintran in iraf ) .",
    "after the registration , the sum of the images in the same band was derived to maximize the signal to noise ratio of each color . for each galaxy",
    "one b sum , one v sum and one r sum were produced .",
    "in addition , we also simply summed all available data in all bands to get a maximum @xmath26 intensity image .",
    "the sky levels were estimated with the use of the `` median '' option of imstat ( in iraf ) in an empty window of these images selected by eye .",
    "the photometric measurements were made by using phot ( in noao.digiphot.apphot ) .",
    "phot was used for two different operations : to use the ccd image to simulate aperture photometry of the entire galaxy and hence , by comparison to published photometry , derive an absolute calibration of the data ; and secondly to obtain aperture photometry of all patches visible around the location of the supernova to investigate the sn environment and locate candidate light echoes .",
    "the photometry used for absolute calibration was from the longo & de vaucouleurs ( 1983 ) and the de vaucouleurs & longo ( 1988 ) aperture photometry catalogs ( respectively b and v , and r ) , not corrected for galactic extinction .",
    "the photometric calibration in each band for each individual galaxy was derived by taking the mean value of all apertures in that band .",
    "magnitudes indicated as `` uncertain '' in the catalogs were not used .",
    "five galaxies ( ngc 3115 , 3627 , 4303 , 4382 and 6384 ) were saturated in their nuclear regions in the long exposures .",
    "thus the calibration for these was bootstrapped from a single unsaturated short exposure , which was calibrated as above .",
    "no aperture photometry was found in the literature for ugc 2069 , ugc 2259 , ic 4237 , ic 4798 and ngc 4674 .",
    "the calibration was realized by adopting the total - extinction corrected blue magnitude provided by ned ( the nasa electronic database ) and by adopting standard b - v and v - r colors appropriate to the galaxy morphological types .",
    "aperture magnitudes were derived for aperture values appropriate to each run pixel scale .",
    "the calibration for ngc 1058 and ngc 1073 was done with respect to two calibration stars ( one observed in each night of observations ) . in the case of ngc 1058",
    "this was necessary because literature photometric apertures fell partially outside the region imaged .",
    "the calibration for field a of ngc 6946 was obtained by scaling it to the calibration of field b , because the galaxy nucleus does not appear in field a , although the two fields imaged do overlap .    finally for a number of galaxies , indicated with an asterisk in tables 1a and 1b ,",
    "r magnitudes were not available . in these cases we assumed a v - r appropriate to the morphological type of the galaxy , using the relations given by buta & williams ( 1995 ; their table 6 and figure 3 ) .      to locate patches of faint light in order to investigate the environments of the supernovae and seek candidate echoes , we firstly simply summed all images in all bands of a given field to make an image with essentially maximum signal to noise ( s / n ) : the `` total sum '' image .",
    "we filtered the image with a 3 x 3 median to eliminate cosmic rays . to isolate compact , discrete patches of emission from the underlying larger scale complex emission of the host galaxy",
    ", we used a digital `` unsharp masking '' method .",
    "the high s / n galaxy image was differenced with a 17 x 17 median filtered version of the same image .",
    "the final output is an image well suited to identify patches of faint light against the background .",
    "in addition to unsharp mask images of the high s / n total sum , we also derived in the same way , unsharp mask images of each individual bandpass ( in b , v and r ) .",
    "figures 1 through 36 show the environments of the individual supernovae as derived from these unsharp masked images : figs .",
    "1 through 13 are for the jkt observations , the remaining for the eso .",
    "the figures are in order of the galaxy right ascension . each supernova environment",
    "is shown in 4 different images : the total sum , followed by the three bands , b , v , and r. a 30 arcsec side box is shown centered at the sn position and displayed between @xmath27 and @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a robust estimate of the dispersion of intensity levels in the box ( specifically half the percentile width corresponding to @xmath30 for a gaussian distribution ) .",
    "each of the unsharp masked total sum images was visually inspected and the position of all distinct objects or patches within a 10 arcsec diameter circle centered at the supernova were tabulated . in a few instances",
    "the position of patches located outside of the ring was tabulated when these patches appear blue in the images .",
    "_ keeping these tabulated positions fixed _",
    ", we then measured their brightness in the other three b , v and r images using a fixed aperture of 3 pixel radius for the jkt run and a fixed aperture of 2 pixels for the eso run ( corresponding to @xmath31 and @xmath32 arcsec respectively ) .",
    "the limiting magnitude for each box is different due to different photometric conditions , different telescopes , exposure times , and different levels of contamination from the underlying host galaxy .",
    "approximate b , v and r limiting magnitudes are respectively given in the last three columns of tables 2a and 2b .",
    "they correspond to a @xmath33 detection , unless otherwise indicated .",
    "each limiting magnitude is calculated over an aperture of 3 and 2 pixels in radius respectively for the jkt and the eso runs using the @xmath29 which is the robust estimate of the dispersion of intensity levels in the box ( as discussed above ) . a complete discussion of tables 2a and 2b is given in section 4 .",
    "local galactic extinction corrections were also applied to the resulting photometry , using values taken from the @xmath34 of the third reference catalog ( rc3 ; de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "the corresponding v and r corrections were derived by taking the following relationships from cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) : @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "results from the photometric data reduction are summarized in tables 2a and 2b ( for the jkt and the eso runs respectively ) . in the first column the name of the galaxy is given ; then the supernova(e ) and the sn type are listed in columns two and three . in the fourth column",
    "we list all patches that have been identified at ( or close to ) the site of the supernova and that were bright enough to be detected during the observation : they are numbered and briefly described by a comment that follows in column five .",
    "such features are close to / within a ring of approximately 5 arcsec in radius centered at the nominal position of the supernova ( see figs . 1 through 36 ) .",
    "a major uncertainty in this work is the actual location of the historical supernova .",
    "re  measurement of a small number of plates containing images of the actual event ( ongoing work ) suggests typical uncertainties of the order of a few arcsec .",
    "hence , for the present purposes , we chose to study a region of @xmath37 diameter centered at the nominal location of the sn .",
    "for each patch the offset coordinates ( in arcsec ) with respect to the sn position have been calculated and are given in the next two columns .",
    "the estimated b , v and r magnitudes and the b - v and v - r colors are listed in columns 8 through 12 of these tables .",
    "they are all corrected for local galactic extinction . as mentioned in sect @xmath38 ,",
    "the following three columns give respectively the b , v and r limiting magnitudes corresponding to a @xmath39 detection ( but some magnitudes correspond to a @xmath40 detection limit and are indicated with an asterisk in tabs .",
    "2a and 2b ) .",
    "finally the last three columns give the estimated @xmath41 uncertainties of the measured b , v and r magnitudes .",
    "these uncertainties lead to a typical uncertainty of @xmath42 magnitude in the colors @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( see color / color plots to follow ) .",
    "the positions of a handful of sne are accurately known from radio observations or astrometric measurements .",
    "pennington et al .",
    "( 1982 ) provide accurate astrometric positions of sne 1923a and 1957d ( in ngc 5236 ) . for other two supernovae in the same galaxy , sne 1950b and 1983n ,",
    "accurate positions are derived from radio observations ( weiler et al . 1986 ) . given these absolute positions , the supernovae were located with respect to the sn 1957d position , which was identified by looking at the sn field observed by long et al .",

    "the eso observations are the squares ; the jkt , the circles .",
    "the empty triangles refer to peculiar supernovae and those whose type is unknown according to the classification in tables 2a and 2b .",
    "the filled triangles are sn 1991 t ( from schmidt et al .",
    "we have always followed the spectroscopic classification of branch ( 1990 ) and therefore sne 1961i , 1961v and 1964f have been considered type ii , while sne 1940e , 1960l , 1963l and 1967h unknown .",
    "sn 1961v ( in ngc 1058 ) which was classified as a type v by zwicky ( 1965 ) might not be a pure sn event ( goodrich et al .",
    "1989 , filippenko et al . 1995 ) and yet can be as useful as any other object if it produced a light echo .",
    "it is clear that different types of sne are located in different regions of the color / color plot : the emission patches associated to type is are mostly located at b - v and v - r redder than @xmath52 , while type iis are on average bluer than this value in both colors .",
    "unknown / peculiars are randomly distributed ; the location of the peculiar type ia sn 1991 t is somewhat consistent with the other peculiars .",
    "this is what might be expected from the distribution of different type sne in different galaxies and in different parts of the parent galaxies themselves .",
    "sne ii / ib likely derive from massive progenitors in spiral galaxies and thus are associated to star ",
    "formation regions where a strong h@xmath53 emission is present ( van dyk et al .",
    "1996 and references therein ) .",
    "this would tend to cause a high positive value of @xmath54 .",
    "type ia sne , instead , possibly derive from a wider variety of stellar environments ( as they are observed both in elliptical and spiral galaxies ; see @xcite for references ) .    in fig .",
    "40 we plot all supernovae except the unknown / peculiar .",
    "we note that known type sne cover a much smaller portion of the color / color plane than unknown / peculiar .    in fig .",
    "41 we plot for comparison both a reddening vector ( solid arrow ) and a scattering vector ( dotted arrow ) to ascertain in what proportions these two physical components affect the colors of our sample of patches .",
    "the reddening vector was derived by assuming the rieke & lebofski ( 1985 ) reddening law : @xmath55 .",
    "the effect of scattering , also , was estimated using scattering cross  sections as tabulated in sparks ( 1994 ) . with these numbers and assuming wavelengths of 4400 , 5500 , 6400 for the bvr filters , light which has been scattered is always bluer by @xmath56 in b - v and @xmath57 in v - r than the unscattered illuminating source . for illustration",
    ", the scattering vector shown originates at b - v = v - r=0 , which is a reasonable estimate of the colors of a supernova at peak luminosity in many cases ( d. branch private communication ) .",
    "in fact , we can not be sure in detail what the colors of the time integrated supernova light curves are since decay rates can be quite wavelength dependent , and reddening may also play a role .",
    "nevertheless , outliers , and especially blue outliers , in these diagrams should be considered as objects worthy of additional follow  up observations as potential echoes , and yet strict sn 1991 t look - alikes , i.e. definite echoes ( @xcite ) , are not present in the sample .    finally , for reference , in fig .",
    "42 colors of main sequence stars of all spectral types were plotted over our sample ( these colors were taken from @xcite ) .",
    "the distribution of patches is broadly consistent with the locations of these main sequence stars .",
    "this distribution covers also a similar region to a composite stellar population as a function of age as was found by plotting an evolutionary track kindly provided by c. leitherer .",
    "we therefore infer that for the most part we are simply seeing stars or star clusters .",
    "however there are in addition patches with both unusually red and unusually blue colors which should be considered with special care .",
    "we have looked for candidate light echoes around 64 supernovae of all types in 38 galaxies . from this",
    "ground  based photometric data we notice optical emission at the sn nominal positions .",
    "the color distribution of these patches is broad , and generally consistent with stellar population colors , possibly with some reddening .",
    "however there are in addition patches with both unusually red and unusually blue colors .",
    "we expect light echoes to be blue , and while none of the objects are quite as blue in v - r as the known light echo of sn1991 t , there are features that are unusually blue and we identify these as candidate echoes for follow - on space and ground observations .",
    "we also made reference to archival wfpc-2/hst observations of fourteen sn fields .",
    "these showed that some of the patches resolve into multiple point sources , while others do not .",
    "the absence of multi - color information within the hst data precludes us from narrowing down our candidate list further , since at wfc resolution we do not expect the sn remnants to show significant spatial extent . as discussed in the text and in sparks ( 1994 ) only polarimetric observations of a field many arcsec in extent around the sn position can succeed in determining whether ( or not ) there is an extended structure .",
    "this is the basis for future observations using the advanced camera on the hubble space telescope .    from the color / color plots we notice that indeed different sn types are characterized by different environments .",
    "sne ia tend to be redder than @xmath58 and @xmath59 , while type ib / ii are bluer than these values .",
    "this distribution seems to reflect the distribution of various sn types in different regions of the parent galaxies and in different galaxies as well .",
