    "the rise of web 2.0 has dramatically changed the way in which information is stored and accessed , and the relationship between information and on - line users .",
    "this is prompting the need for a new research agenda about `` web science '' , as put forward in  @xcite .",
    "a central role is played by user - driven information networks , i.e. , networks of on - line resources built in a bottom - up fashion by web users .",
    "these networks entangle cognitive , behavioral and social aspects of human agents with the structure of the underlying technological system , effectively creating techno - social systems that display rich emergent features and _ emergent semantics _  @xcite .",
    "understanding their structure and evolution brings forth new challenges .",
    "many popular web applications are now exploiting user - driven information networks built by means of _ social annotations _",
    "social annotations are freely established associations between web resources and metadata ( keywords , categories , ratings ) performed by a community of web users with little or no central coordination .",
    "a mechanism of this kind which has swiftly become well - established is that of  @xcite , whereby web users associate free - form keywords  called `` tags ''  with on - line content such as web pages , digital photographs , bibliographic references and other media .",
    "the product of the users tagging activity is an open - ended information network  commonly referred to as `` folksonomy ''  which can be used for navigation and recommendation of content , and has been the object of many recent investigations across different disciplines  @xcite .",
    "here we show how simple concepts borrowed from statistical physics and the study of complex networks can provide a modeling framework for the dynamics of collaborative tagging and the structure of the ensuing folksonomy .",
    "two main aspects of the social annotation process , so far unexplained , deserve a special attention .",
    "one striking feature is the so - called heaps law  @xcite ( also known as herdan s law in linguistics ) , originally studied in information retrieval for its relevance for indexing schemes  @xcite .",
    "heaps law is an empirical law which describes the growth in a text of the number of distinct words as a function of the number of total words scanned .",
    "it describes thus the rate of innovation in a stream of words , where innovation means the adoption for the first time in the text of a given word .",
    "this law , also experimentally observed in streams of tags , consists of a power - law with a sub - linear behavior  @xcite . in this case",
    "the rate of innovation is the rate of introduction of new tags , and a sub - linear behavior corresponds to a rate of adoption of new words or tags decreasing with the total number of words ( or tags ) scanned .",
    "most existing studies about heaps law , either in information retrieval or in linguistics , explained it as a consequence of the so - called zipf s law  @xcite .",
    "it would instead be highly desirable to have an explanation for it relying only on very basic assumptions on the mechanisms behind social annotation .    another important way to analyze the emerging data structures",
    "is given by the framework of complex networks  @xcite .",
    "these structures are indeed user - driven information networks @xcite , i.e. , networks linking ( for instance ) on - line resources , tags and users , built in a bottom - up fashion through the uncoordinated activity of thousands to millions of web users .",
    "we shall focus in particular on the particular structure of the so - called co - occurrence network .",
    "the co - occurrence network is a weighted network where nodes are tags and two tags are linked if they were used together by at least one user , the weight being larger when this simultaneous use is shared by many users .",
    "correlations between tag occurrences are ( at least partially ) an externalization of the relations between the corresponding meanings  @xcite and have been used to infer formal representations of knowledge from social annotations  @xcite .",
    "notice that co - occurrence of two tags is not a priori equivalent to a semantic link between the meanings / concepts associated with those tags , and that understanding what co - occurrence precisely means , in terms of semantic relations of the co - occurring tags , is an open question that is investigated in more applied contexts @xcite .    on these aspects of social annotation systems , a certain number of stylized facts , about e.g. tag frequencies  @xcite or the growth of the tag vocabulary  @xcite , have been reported but no modeling framework exists which can naturally account for them while reproducing the co - occurrence network structure . here",
    "we ask whether one is able to explain the structure of such a network in terms of some suitable generative model and how the structure of the experimentally observed co - occurrence network is related to the underlying hypotheses of the modeling scheme .",
    "we show in particular that the idea of social exploration of a semantic space has more than a metaphorical value , and actually allows us to reproduce simultaneously a set of independent correlations and fine observables of tag co - occurrence networks as well as robust stylized facts of collaborative tagging systems .",
    "we investigate user - driven information networks using data from two social bookmarking systems : del.icio.us and bibsonomy .",
    "del.icio.us is a very popular system for bookmarking web pages and pioneered the mechanisms of collaborative tagging .",
    "it hosts a large body of social annotations that have been used for several scientific investigations .",
    "bibsonomy is a smaller system for bookmarking bibliographic references and web pages  @xcite . both del.icio.us and bibsonomy are _ broad _ folksonomies  @xcite ,",
    "in which users provide metadata about pre - existing resources and multiple annotations are possible for the same resource , making the ensuing tagging patterns truly `` social '' and allowing their statistical characterization .",
    "a single user annotation , also known as a _ post _ , is a triple of the form @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a user identificator , @xmath2 is the unique identificator of a resource ( a url pointing to a web page , for the systems under study ) , and @xmath3 is a set of tags represented as text strings .",
    "we define the tag co - occurrence network based on post co - occurrence .",
    "that is , given a set of posts , we create an undirected and weighted network where nodes are tags and two tags @xmath4 and @xmath5 are connected by an edge if and only if there exists one post in which they were used in conjunction .",
    "the weight @xmath6 of an edge between tags @xmath4 and @xmath5 can be naturally defined as the number of distinct posts where @xmath4 and @xmath5 co - occur .",
    "this construction reflects the existence of semantic correlations between tags , and translates the fact that these correlations are stronger between tags co - occurring more frequently .",
    "we emphasize once again that the co - occurrence network is an externalization of hidden semantic links , and therefore distinct from underlying semantic lexicons or networks .",
    "the del.icio.us dataset we used consists of approximately @xmath7 posts , comprising about @xmath8 users , @xmath9 resources ( bookmarks ) and @xmath10 distinct tags .",
    "it covers almost @xmath11 years of user activity , from early 2004 up to november 2006 .",
    "overall , @xmath12 user pages of the del.icio.us community were crawled , for a total of @xmath13 resources , @xmath14 distinct tags , and @xmath15 tag assignments ( triples ) .",
    "the data were subsequently post - processed for the present study .",
    "we discarded all posts containing no tags ( about @xmath16% of the total ) .",
    "as del.icio.us is case - preserving but not case sensitive , we ignored capitalization in tag comparison , and counted all different capitalizations of a given tag as instances of the same lower - case tag .",
    "the timestamp of each post was used to establish post ordering and determine the temporal evolution of the system .",
    "posts with invalid timestamps , i.e.  times set in the future or before del.icio.us started operating , were discarded as well ( less than @xmath17% of the total ) .    except for the normalization of character case ,",
    "no lexical normalization was applied to tags during post - processing .",
    "the notion of identity of tags is identified with the notion of identity of their string representation .",
    "bibsonomy  @xcite is a smaller system than del.icio.us , but it was designed keeping data sharing in mind . because of this , there is no need to crawl bibsonomy by downloading html pages and parsing them .",
    "direct access to post data in structured form is available by using the bibsonomy api ( http://www.bibsonomy.org/help/doc/api.html ) . moreover , the bibsonomy team periodically releases snapshot datasets of the full system and makes them available to the research community . for the present work we used the dataset released on january 2008 ( https://www.kde.cs.uni-kassel.de/bibsonomy/dumps/2007-12-31.tgz ) .",
    "bibsonomy allows two different types of resources : bookmarks ( i.e. , urls of web pages , similar to del.icio.us ) and bibtex entries . to make contact with the analysis done for del.icio.us , we restricted the dataset to the posts involving bookmark resources only .",
    "the resulting dataset we used comprises @xmath18 users , @xmath19 resources , @xmath20 distinct tags , and @xmath21 tag assignments ( triples ) .",
    "the data from bibsonomy was post - processed in the same way as the data from del.icio.us .",
    "while the bibsonomy dataset is much smaller than the del.icio.us dataset , it is a precious one : direct access to bibsonomy s database guarantees that the bibsonomy dataset is free from biases due to the data collection procedure .",
    "this is important because it allows us to show that the investigated features of the data are robust across different systems , and not only established in a case where biases due to data collection could be possible .",
    "the study of the global properties of the tagging system , and in particular of the global co - occurrence network , is of interest but mixes potentially many different phenomena .",
    "we therefore consider a narrower semantic context , defined as the set of posts containing one given tag .",
    "we define the vocabulary associated with a given tag @xmath22 as the set of all tags occurring in a post together with @xmath22 , and the time is counted as the number of posts in which @xmath22 has appeared .",
    "the size of the vocabulary follows a sub - linear power - law growth ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , similar to the heaps law  @xcite observed for the vocabulary associated with a given resource , and for the global vocabulary @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] also displays the main properties of the co - occurrence network , as measured by the quantities customarily used to characterize statistically complex networks and to validate models  @xcite .",
    "these quantities can be separated in two groups .",
    "on the one hand , they include the distributions of single node or single link quantities , whose investigations allow to distinguish between homogeneous and heterogeneous systems .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows that the co - occurrence networks display broad distributions of node degrees @xmath23 ( number of neighbors of node @xmath24 ) , node strengths @xmath25 ( sum of the weights of the links connected to @xmath24 , @xmath26 ) , and link weights .",
    "the average strength @xmath27 of vertices with degree @xmath28 , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the number of nodes of degree @xmath28 , also shows that correlations between topological information and weights are present . on the other hand , these distributions by themselves are not sufficient to fully characterize a network and higher order correlations have to be investigated .",
    "in particular , the average nearest neighbors degree of a vertex @xmath24 , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the set of @xmath24 s neighbors , gives information on correlations between the degrees of neighboring nodes . moreover , the clustering coefficient @xmath33 of a node @xmath24 measures local cohesiveness through the ratio between the number @xmath34 of links between the @xmath23 neighbors of @xmath24 and the maximum number of such links @xcite .",
    "the functions @xmath35 and @xmath36 are convenient summaries of these quantities , that can also be generalized to include weights ( see si for the definitions of @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows that broad distributions and non - trivial correlations are observed .",
    "all the measured features are robust across tags within one tagging system , and also across the tagging systems we investigated .",
    "the observed features are emergent characteristics of the uncoordinated action of a user community , which call for a rationalization and for a modeling framework .",
    "we now present a simple mechanism able to reproduce the complex evolution and structure of the empirical data .",
    "the fundamental idea underlying our approach , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , is that a post corresponds to a random walk ( rw ) of the user in a `` semantic space '' modeled as a graph .",
    "starting from a given tag , the user adds other tags , going from one tag to another by semantic association .",
    "it is then natural to picture the semantic space as network - like , with nodes representing tags and links representing the possibility of a semantic link @xcite . a precise and complete description of such a semantic network being out of reach",
    ", we make very general hypothesis about its structure and we have checked the robustness of our results with respect to different plausible choices of the graph structure @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , as we shall see later on , our results help fixing some constraints on the structural properties of such a semantic space : it should have a finite average degree together with a small graph diameter , which ensures that rws starting from a fixed node and of limited length can potentially reach all nodes of the graph . in this framework , the vocabulary co",
    "- occurring with a tag is associated with the ensemble of nodes reached by successive random walks starting from a given node , and its size with the number of _ distinct _ visited nodes , @xmath39 , which grows as a function of the number of performed random walks @xmath40 .",
    "let us first consider random walks of fixed length @xmath41 starting from a given node @xmath42 .",
    "we denote by @xmath43 the probability for each of these random walks to visit node @xmath44 .",
    "the probability that @xmath44 has _ not _ been visited after @xmath40 random walks is then simply @xmath45 since the random walks are independent stochastic processes , and the probability that @xmath44 has been visited at least once reads @xmath46 the average number of distinct nodes visited after @xmath40 random walks is then given , without any assumption on the network s structure , by @xmath47 where the sum runs over all nodes of the network .    while this exact expression is not yet really informative , it is possible to go further under some simple assumptions ( we also note that analytical results are available in the case of random walks performed either on lattices or on fractal substrates @xcite ) . since all the random walks start from the same origin @xmath42 , it is useful to divide the network into successive `` rings '' @xcite , each ring of label @xmath41 being formed by the nodes at distance @xmath41 from @xmath42 .",
    "the ring @xmath48 is formed by the neighbours of @xmath42 , the ring @xmath49 by the neighbours neighbours which are not part of ring @xmath50 , and so forth .",
    "we denote by @xmath51 the number of nodes in ring @xmath41 .",
    "we now make the assumption that all @xmath51 nodes at distance @xmath41 have the same probability to be reached by a random walk starting from @xmath42 ( which is the sole element of ring @xmath52 ) .",
    "this is rigorously true for example for a tree with constant coordination number , and more generally will hold approximately in homogeneous networks , while stronger deviations are expected in heterogeneous networks .",
    "let us assume moreover that the random walk of length @xmath53 consists , at each step , of moving from one ring @xmath41 to the next ring @xmath54 .",
    "this is once again rigorously true for a self - avoiding random - walk on a tree , and can be expected to hold approximately if @xmath51 grows fast enough with @xmath41 : the probability to go from ring @xmath41 to ring @xmath54 is then larger than to go back to ring @xmath55 or to stay within ring @xmath41 . for each random walk of length @xmath53",
    ", we then have @xmath56 for each node @xmath44 in ring @xmath57 , and after @xmath40 walks , the average number of distinct visited nodes reads @xmath58    the expression ( [ eqnl ] ) lends itself to numerical investigation using various forms for the growth of @xmath51 as a function of @xmath41 .",
    "we obtain ( not shown ) that , as @xmath40 increases , @xmath39 increases , with an approximate power - law form , and saturates as @xmath59 at the total number of reachable nodes @xmath60 .",
    "moreover , the increase at low @xmath40 is sub - linear if @xmath51 grows fast enough with @xmath41 ( at least @xmath61 ) , and is closer to linear if @xmath53 increases .      empirical evidence on the distribution of post lengths ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) suggests to consider random walks of random lengths , distributed according to a broad law .",
    "let us therefore now consider , under the same assumptions , that the successive random walks have randomly distributed lengths according to a certain @xmath62 .",
    "each ring @xmath41 , on average , is then reached by a random walk @xmath63 times , so that we have approximately @xmath64 where the sum ( provided it converges ) now runs over all possible lengths .",
    "if @xmath62 is narrowly distributed around an average value , the form ( [ eqnlpl ] ) will not differ very much from the case of fixed length given by eq .",
    "( [ eqnl ] ) .",
    "conversely , for a broad @xmath62 , longer random walks will occur as @xmath40 increases and the tail of @xmath62 is sampled , allowing visits to nodes situated further from @xmath42 and avoiding the saturation effect observed for random walks of fixed length .    in some particular cases , a further analytical insight into the form of @xmath65",
    "can be obtained :    * assume that @xmath66 , and that @xmath62 is power - law distributed ( @xmath67 )",
    ". then @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is a constant .",
    "the terms in the sum become negligible for @xmath41 larger than @xmath70 , while they are close to @xmath71 for smaller values of @xmath41 .",
    "the sum therefore behaves as @xmath72 i.e. a power - law .",
    "for instance , for @xmath73 we obtain a sub - linear power - law growth with exponent @xmath74 , i.e. @xmath75 for @xmath76 , or @xmath77 for @xmath78 . *",
    "assume that @xmath79 , which corresponds to a tree in which each node has @xmath80 neighbours , and @xmath81 .",
    "then @xmath82 . as in the previous case ,",
    "the terms in the sum become negligible for @xmath41 larger than @xmath83 , while they are close to @xmath84 for smaller @xmath41 .",
    "thus the sum behaves as @xmath85 i.e. we obtain a linear behaviour with logarithmic corrections , which is known to be very similar to sub - linear power - law behaviours .",
    "we have thus shown analytically , under reasonable assumptions , that performing fixed length random walks starting from the same node yields a growth of the number of distinct visited sites ( representing the vocabulary size ) as a function of the number of random walks ( representing posts ) which is sub - linear with a saturation effect , and that broad distributions of the walks lengths lead to sub - linear growths of the vocabulary , and avoid the saturation effect .",
    "figure [ fig3](top ) shows a confirmation of the appearance of a sub - linear power - law - like growth of @xmath39 , mimicking the heaps law observed in tagging systems , for random walks performed on a watts - strogatz network .",
    "vocabulary growth is only one aspect of the dynamics of tagging systems .",
    "networks of co - occurrence carry much more detailed signatures that present very specific features ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "interestingly , our approach allows to construct _",
    "synthetic _ co - occurrence networks : we associate to each random walk a clique formed by the nodes visited ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) , and consider the union of the @xmath40 such cliques",
    ". moreover , each link @xmath86 built in this way receives a weight equal to the number of times nodes @xmath44 and @xmath87 appear together in a random walk .",
    "this construction mimics precisely the obtention of the empirical co - occurrence network , and also reflects the idea that tags that are far apart in the underlying semantic network are visited together less often than tags which are semantically closer .",
    "figures  [ fig3 ] and  [ fig4 ] show how the synthetic networks reproduce _ all _ statistical characteristics of the empirical data ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , both topological and weighted , including highly non - trivial correlations between topology and weights .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] in particular explores how the weight @xmath88 of a link is correlated with its extremities degrees @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the peculiar shape of the curve can be understood within our framework .",
    "first , the broad distribution in @xmath41 is responsible for the plateau @xmath91 at small values of @xmath92 , since it corresponds to long rws that occur rarely and visit nodes that will be typically reached a very small number of times ( hence small weights ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath93 at large weights . denoting by @xmath94 the number of times node @xmath44 is visited , @xmath95 in a mean - field approximation that neglects correlations . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath89 is by definition the number of distinct nodes visited together with node @xmath44 . restricting the random walks to the only processes that visit @xmath44 , it is reasonable to assume that such sampling preserves heaps law , so that @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the growth exponent for the global process .",
    "this leads to @xmath93 with @xmath98 . since @xmath99",
    ", we obtain @xmath100 close to @xmath101 , consistently with the numerics .",
    "strikingly , the synthetic co - occurrence networks reproduce other , more subtle observables , such as the distribution of cosine similarities between nodes . in a weighted network , the similarity of two nodes @xmath102 and @xmath103 can be defined as @xmath104 which is the scalar product of the vectors of normalized weights of nodes @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "this quantity , which measures the similarities between neighbourhoods of nodes , contains non - trivial semantic information that can be used to detect synonymy relations between tags , or to uncover `` concepts '' from social annotations @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows the histograms of pair - wise similarities between nodes in real and synthetic co - occurrence networks .",
    "the distributions are very similar , with a skewed behaviour and a peak for low values of the similarities .",
    "while the data shown in fig.s  [ fig3 ] and  [ fig4 ] correspond to a particular example of underlying network ( a watts - strogatz network , see  @xcite ) taken as a cartoon for the semantic space , we have also investigated the dependence of the synthetic network properties on the structure of the semantic space and on the other parameters , such as @xmath40 or the distribution of the random walk lengths .",
    "interestingly , we find an overall extremely robust behavior for the diverse synthetic networks , showing that the proposed mechanism reproduces the empirical data without any need for strong hypothesis on the semantic space structure .",
    "the only general constraints we can fix on our proposed mechanism are the existence of an underlying semantic graph with a small diameter and a finite average degree ( random walks on a fully connected graph would not work , for instance ) and a broad distribution of post lengths .",
    "this lack of strong constraints on the precise structure of the underlying semantic network is actually a remarkable feature of the proposed mechanism .",
    "the details of the underlying network will unavoidably depend on the context , namely on the specific choice of the central tag @xmath22 , and the robustness of the generative model matches the robustness of the features observed in co - occurrence networks from real systems .",
    "of course , given an empiric co - occurrence network , a careful simultaneous fitting procedure of the various observables would be needed to choose the most general class of semantic network structures that generate that specific network by means of the mechanism introduced here .",
    "this delicate issue goes beyond the goal of this paper , and also raises the open question of the definition of the minimal set of statistical observables needed to specify a graph @xcite .",
    "investigating the interplay of human and technological factors in user - driven systems is crucial to understand the evolution and the potential impact these techno - social systems will have on our societies .",
    "here we have shown that sophisticated features of the information networks stemming from social annotations can be captured by regarding the process of social annotation as a collective exploration of a semantic space , modeled as a graph , by means of a series of random walks .",
    "the proposed generative mechanism naturally yields an explanation for the heaps law observed for the growth of tag vocabularies .",
    "the properties of the co - occurrence networks generated by this mechanism are robust with respect to the details of the underlying graph , provided it has a small diameter and a small average degree .",
    "this mirrors the robustness of the stylized facts observed in the experimental data , across different systems .",
    "networks of resources , users , and metadata such as tags have become a central collective artifact of the information society . these networks expose aspects of semantics and of human dynamics , and are situated at the core of innovative applications .",
    "because of their novelty , research about their structure and evolution has been mostly confined to applicative contexts .",
    "the results presented here are a definite step towards a fundamental understanding of user - driven information networks that can prompt interesting developments , as they involve the application of recently - developed tools from complex networks theory to this new domain .",
    "an open problem , for instance , is the generalization of our modeling approach to the case of the full hyper - graph of social annotations , of which the co - occurrence network is a projection .",
    "moreover , user - driven information networks lend themselves to the investigation of the interplay between social behavior and semantics , with theoretical and applicative outcomes such as node ranking ( i.e. , for search and recommendation ) , detection of non - social behavior ( such as spam ) , and the development of algorithms to learn semantic relations from large - scale dataset of social annotations .",
