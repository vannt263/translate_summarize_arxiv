    "an important and challenging task in computational modeling is the solution of inverse problems , which convert noisy and indirect observational data into useful characterizations of the unknown parameters of a numerical model . in this process ,",
    "statistical methods  bayesian methods in particular  play a fundamental role in modeling various information sources and quantifying the uncertainty of the model parameters @xcite . in the bayesian framework ,",
    "the unknown parameters are modeled as random variables and hence can be characterized by their posterior distribution .",
    "markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) methods @xcite provide a powerful and flexible approach for sampling from posterior distributions .",
    "the bayesian framework has been applied to inverse problems in various fields , for example , geothermal reservoir modeling @xcite , groundwater modeling @xcite , ocean dynamics @xcite , remote sensing @xcite , and seismic inversion @xcite .    to generate a sufficient number of samples from the posterior distribution ,",
    "mcmc methods require sequential evaluations of the posterior probability density at many different points in the parameter space .",
    "each evaluation of the posterior density involves a solution of the forward model used to define the likelihood function , which typically is a computationally intensive undertaking ( e.g. , the solution of a system of pdes ) . in this many - query situation ,",
    "one way to address the computational burden of evaluating the forward model is to replace it with a computationally efficient surrogate .",
    "surrogate models have been applied to inverse problems in several settings ; for example , @xcite employed generalized polynomial chaos expansions , @xcite employed gaussian process models , and @xcite used projection - based reduced - order models . in this work , we also focus on projection - based reduced - order models ( although the data - driven strategy underlying our approach should be applicable to other types of surrogate models ) .",
    "a projection - based reduced - order model reduces the computational complexity of the original or `` full '' forward model by solving a projection of the full model onto a reduced subspace . for the model reduction methods we consider",
    ", the construction of the reduced subspace requires evaluating the full model at representative samples drawn from the parameter space .",
    "the solutions of the full model at these samples are referred to as snapshots @xcite .",
    "their span defines the reduced subspace , represented via an orthogonal basis .",
    "the quality of the reduced - order model relies crucially on the choice of the samples for computing the snapshots . to construct reduced - order models targeting the bayesian solution of the inverse problem , we employ existing projection - based model reduction techniques .",
    "our innovation is in a data - driven approach that adaptively selects samples from the posterior distribution for the snapshot evaluations .",
    "this approach has two distinctive features :    1 .",
    "we integrate the reduced - order model construction process into an adaptive mcmc algorithm that simultaneously samples the posterior and selects posterior samples for computing the snapshots . during the sampling process",
    ", the numerical accuracy of the reduced - order model is adaptively improved .",
    "the approximate posterior distribution defined by the reduced - order model is used to increase the efficiency of mcmc sampling .",
    "we either couple the reduced - order model and the full model together to accelerate the sampling of the full posterior distribution , or directly explore the approximate posterior distribution induced by the reduced - order model . in the latter case ,",
    "sampling the approximate distribution yields a biased monte carlo estimator , but the bias can be controlled using error indicators or estimators .",
    "compared to the classical offline approaches that build the reduced - order model before using it in the many - query situation , the motivation for collecting snapshots during posterior exploration is to build a reduced - order model that focuses on a more concentrated region in the parameter space . because the solution of the inverse problem is unknown until the data are available , reduced - order models built offline have to retain a level of numerical accuracy over a rather large region in the parameter space , which covers the support of the posterior distributions for all the possible observed data sets .",
    "for example , samples used for computing the snapshots are typically drawn from the prior distribution @xcite . in comparison , our data - driven approach focuses only on the posterior distribution resulting from a particular data set .",
    "as the observed data necessarily increase the information divergence of the prior distribution from the posterior distribution @xcite , the support of the posterior distribution is more compact than that of the prior distribution .",
    "figure [ fig : prior_post ] illustrates a simple two - dimensional inference problem , where the prior distribution and the posterior distribution are represented by the blue and red contours , respectively .",
    "the left plot of figure  [ fig : prior_post ] shows 50 randomly drawn prior samples for computing the snapshots , each of which has a low probability of being in the support of the posterior . in comparison",
    ", the samples selected by our data - driven approach , as shown in the right plot of figure [ fig : prior_post ] , are scattered within the region of high posterior probability . by retaining numerical accuracy only in a more concentrated region",
    ", the data - driven reduced - order model requires a basis of lower dimension to achieve the same level of accuracy compared to the reduced - order model built offline .",
    "for the same reason , the data - driven model reduction technique can potentially have better scalability with parameter dimension than the offline approach .",
    "we note that goal - oriented model reduction approaches have been developed in the context of pde - constrained optimization @xcite , in which the reduced - order model is simultaneously constructed during the optimization process . in these methods ,",
    "the snapshots for constructing the reduced basis are only evaluated at points in the parameter space that are close to the trajectory of the optimization algorithm .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we outline the bayesian framework for solving inverse problems and discuss the sampling efficiency and monte carlo error of mcmc . in section 3 , we introduce the data - driven model reduction approach , and construct the data - driven reduced - order model within an adaptive delayed acceptance algorithm to speed up mcmc sampling .",
    "we also provide results on the ergodicity of the algorithm .",
    "section 4 analyzes some properties of the data - driven reduced - order model . in section 5",
    ", we discuss a modified framework that adaptively constructs the reduced - order model and simultaneously explores the induced approximate posterior distribution .",
    "we also provide an analysis of the mean square error of the resulting monte carlo estimator . in section 6 ,",
    "we demonstrate and discuss various aspects of our methods through numerical examples .",
    "section 7 offers concluding remarks .",
    "the first part of this section provides a brief overview of the bayesian framework for inverse problems .",
    "further details can be found in @xcite .",
    "the second part of this section discusses the efficiency of mcmc sampling for computationally intensive inverse problems .",
    "given a physical system , let @xmath0 denote the @xmath1-dimensional unknown parameter , and @xmath2 denote the @xmath3-dimensional observed data .",
    "the forward model @xmath4 maps a given parameter @xmath5 to the observable model outputs @xmath6 .    in a bayesian",
    "setting the first task is to construct the prior models and the likelihood function as probability distributions .",
    "the prior density is a stochastic model representing knowledge of the unknown @xmath5 _ before _ any measurements and is denoted by @xmath7 .",
    "the likelihood function specifies the probability density of the observation @xmath8 for a given set of parameters @xmath5 , denoted by @xmath9 .",
    "we assume that the data and the model parameters follow the stochastic relationship @xmath10 where the random vector @xmath11 captures the measurement noise and other uncertainties in the observation - model relationship , including model errors . without additional knowledge of the measurement process and model errors ,",
    "@xmath11 is modeled as a zero mean gaussian , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the covariance .",
    "let @xmath14 denote the data - misfit function .",
    "the resulting likelihood function is proportional to @xmath15 by bayes formula , the posterior probability density is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the normalizing constant .    in the general framework set up by @xcite , we can explore the posterior distribution given by ( [ eq : post ] ) using mcmc methods such as the metropolis - hastings algorithm @xcite .",
    "the metropolis - hastings algorithm uses a proposal distribution and an acceptance / rejection step to construct the transition kernel of a markov chain that converges to the desired target distribution .",
    "once we draw a sufficient number of samples from the posterior distribution , the expectations of functions over the posterior distribution can be estimated by monte carlo integration .",
    "suppose we wish to estimate the expectation of a function @xmath18 over the posterior distribution @xmath19 by @xmath20 posterior samples , @xmath21 .",
    "the resulting monte carlo estimator of @xmath22 is @xmath23 which is an unbiased estimator with the mean square error @xmath24 because the samples drawn by an mcmc algorithm are correlated , the variance of @xmath25 is dependent on the effective sample size @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the integrated autocorrelation of @xmath18 ; see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 5.8 ) for a detailed derivation and further references .    in practice",
    ", we wish to improve the * computational efficiency * of the mcmc algorithm , which is defined by the effective sample size for a given budget of cpu time .",
    "there are two ways to achieve this :    1 .",
    "improve the * statistical efficiency*. to increase the effective sample size for a given number of mcmc iterations , one can reduce the sample correlation by designing proposals that traverse the parameter space more efficiently .",
    "for example , adaptive mcmc methods @xcite use adaptation to learn the covariance structure of the posterior distribution online , and use this information to design proposal distributions .",
    "algorithms such as stochastic newton @xcite and riemannian manifold mcmc @xcite use local derivative information to construct efficient proposals that adapt to the local geometry of the posterior distribution .",
    "2 .   increase the number of mcmc steps for a given amount of cpu time . because simulating the forward model in the data - misfit function ( [ eq : misfit ] ) is cpu - intensive",
    ", computing the posterior density at every iteration is the major bottleneck of the standard mcmc algorithm . by using a fast approximation to the forward model",
    ", the amount of computing time can be reduced .",
    "this effort complements the use of mcmc algorithms that require local derivatives , since fast approximations of the forward model also enable fast evaluations of its gradient and even higher - order derivatives .",
    "one important remark is that by drawing samples directly from an approximate posterior distribution ( i.e. , the one induced by our approximation of the forward model ) , the resulting monte carlo estimator ( [ eq : mc ] ) is * biased*. algorithms such as surrogate transition @xcite or delayed acceptance @xcite mcmc can be used to couple the posterior distribution and its approximation together to ensure the samples are drawn from the full posterior distribution . on the other hand ,",
    "if the accuracy of the posterior approximation can be tightly controlled , then some bias may be acceptable if it enables significant variance reduction , and thus an overall reduction in the mean squared error of an estimate of a posterior expectation , for a given computational effort .",
    "we explore both options in this work .",
    "this section introduces our data - driven model reduction approach , and the adaptive sampling framework for simultaneously constructing the reduced - order model and exploring the posterior distribution .",
    "suppose the system of interest can be described by a system of nonlinear steady partial differential equations ( pdes ) , with a finite element or finite difference discretization that results in a discretized system in the form of @xmath28 in equation ( [ eq : forward_a ] ) , @xmath29 represents the discretized state of the system , @xmath30 is the dimension of the system ( the number of unknowns ) , @xmath31 is a discretized linear operator , @xmath32 represents the discretized nonlinear terms of the governing pde , and @xmath33 denotes the forcing terms .",
    "all of @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 can be parameterized by the unknown parameter @xmath5 .",
    "an observation operator @xmath37 maps the state of the system to the observable model outputs , i.e. , @xmath38 equations ( [ eq : forward_a ] ) and ( [ eq : forward_b ] ) define the _ forward model _ , @xmath4 , that maps a realization of the unknown parameter @xmath5 to observable model outputs .",
    "our data - driven model reduction approach selects a set of @xmath39 posterior samples @xmath40 to compute the snapshots @xmath41 by solving equation ( [ eq : forward_a ] ) for each sample @xmath42 . by constructing the reduced basis @xmath43",
    ", the state @xmath44 can be approximated by a linear combination of the reduced basis vectors , i.e. , @xmath45 . then equation ( [ eq : forward_a ] )",
    "can be approximated by applying the galerkin projection : @xmath46 and the associated model outputs are @xmath47 if @xmath48 , the dimension of the unknown state in ( [ eq : reduced_a ] ) and ( [ eq : reduced_b ] ) is greatly reduced compared to that of the original full system ( [ eq : forward_a ] ) and ( [ eq : forward_b ] ) .",
    "thus ( [ eq : reduced_a ] ) and ( [ eq : reduced_b ] ) define a reduced - order model @xmath49 that maps a realization of the unknown parameter @xmath5 to an approximation of the observable model outputs @xmath50 .",
    "care must be taken to ensure efficient solution of the reduced - order model , since in the presence of general parametric dependence , the equations ( [ eq : reduced_a ] ) and ( [ eq : reduced_b ] ) have low state dimension but are not necessarily fast to solve .",
    "this is because for each new parameter @xmath5 , solution of the reduced - order model requires evaluating the full scale system matrices or residual , projecting those matrices or residual onto the reduced basis , and then solving the resulting low dimensional system .",
    "since many elements of these computations depend on @xmath30 , the dimension of the original system , this process is typically computationally expensive ( unless there is special structure to be exploited , such as affine parametric dependence ) . to reduce the computational cost of this process , methods such as the missing point estimation @xcite , the empirical interpolation @xcite and its discrete variant @xcite approximate the nonlinear term in the reduced - order model by selective spatial sampling .",
    "we note that for systems that exhibit a wide range of behaviors , recently developed localization approaches such as @xcite adaptively construct multiple local reduced bases , each tailored to a particular system behavior that is associated with a subdomain of the state space or the parameter space .",
    "our use of adaptation is different , focusing on the adaptive selection of posterior samples for evaluating the snapshots . in this paper",
    "we consider only the case of a global reduced basis ; however , future work could combine our adaptive posterior sampling approach with a localization strategy to build multiple local reduced bases , each adapted to the local structure of the posterior .",
    "the data - misfit function ( [ eq : misfit ] ) can be approximated by replacing the forward model @xmath51 with the reduced - order model @xmath52 , which gives @xmath53 then the resulting approximate posterior distribution has the form @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the normalizing constant .",
    "our data - driven approach adaptively selects the sample for evaluating the next snapshot such that the scaled error of the reduced - order model outputs , @xmath56 for the current reduced basis @xmath57 , is above a user - specified threshold . the whitening transformation @xmath58 computes the relative error of the reduced - order model compared with noise level of the observed data , which has standard deviation 1 after the transformation . in case that we wish to bypass the forward model evaluations ,",
    "so that the error @xmath59 can not be computed directly , an error indicator or an error estimator , @xmath60 , can be used . in this work ,",
    "we use the dual weighted residual technique @xcite to compute an error indicator .      to achieve simultaneous model reduction and posterior exploration ,",
    "we employ the adaptive delayed acceptance algorithm of @xcite .",
    "suppose we have a reduced - order model constructed from an initial reduced basis .",
    "at each iteration of the mcmc sampling , we first sample the approximate posterior distribution based on the reduced - order model for a certain number of steps using a standard metropolis - hastings algorithm .",
    "this first - stage subchain simulation should have sufficient number of steps , so that its initial state and last state are uncorrelated .",
    "then the last state of the subchain is used as a proposal candidate in the second - stage of the algorithm , and the acceptance probability for this candidate is computed based on the ratio of the full posterior density value to the approximate posterior density value .",
    "this delayed acceptance algorithm employs the first - stage subchain to decrease the sample correlation by sampling the computationally fast approximate posterior , then uses the acceptance / rejection in the second - stage to ensure that the algorithm correctly samples the full posterior distribution .",
    "the statistical efficiency of the delayed acceptance algorithm relies on the accuracy of the approximate posterior .",
    "an approximate posterior induced by an inaccurate reduced - order model can potentially result in a higher second - stage rejection rate , which decreases the statistical efficiency of the delayed acceptance algorithm .",
    "this is because duplicated mcmc samples generated by rejections increase the sample correlation ( we refer to @xcite for a formal justification ) . to maintain statistical efficiency",
    ", we aim to construct a sufficiently accurate reduced - order model , so that the resulting second - stage acceptance probability is close to @xmath61 . to achieve this ,",
    "we introduce adaptive reduced basis enrichment into the delayed acceptance algorithm .",
    "after each full posterior density evaluation , the state of the associated forward model evaluation can be used as a potential new snapshot .",
    "we compute the scaled error ( [ eq : scaled_error ] ) of the reduced - order model outputs at each new posterior sample , and the reduced basis is updated with the new snapshot when the error exceeds a user - given threshold @xmath62 . by choosing an appropriate threshold @xmath62 , we can control the maximum allowable amount of error of the reduced - order model .",
    "the resulting reduced - order model is data - driven , since it uses the information provided by the observed data ( in the form of the posterior distribution ) to select samples for computing the snapshots .",
    "it is also an online model reduction approach , since the reduced - order model is built concurrently with posterior sampling .",
    "since the adaptive sampling procedure samples from the full posterior distribution , hereafter we refer to it as the `` full target algorithm .",
    "'' details of the full target algorithm are given in algorithm [ algo : full ] .",
    "given the subchain length @xmath63 , the maximum allowable reduced basis dimension @xmath64 , and the error threshold @xmath62 . at step @xmath30 ,",
    "given state @xmath65 , a proposal distribution @xmath66 , and a reduced - order model @xmath52 defined by the reduced basis @xmath67 , one step of the algorithm is : set @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 propose a candidate @xmath71 , then evaluate the acceptance probability @xmath72 accept @xmath73 by setting @xmath74 reject @xmath73 by setting @xmath75 @xmath76 * break * set @xmath77 , then evaluate the acceptance probability using the full posterior @xmath78 accept @xmath79 by setting @xmath80 reject @xmath79 by setting @xmath81 update the reduced basis @xmath67 to @xmath82 using the new full model evaluation at @xmath79 by a gram - schmidt process    lines 113 of algorithm [ algo : full ] simulate a markov chain with invariant distribution @xmath83 for @xmath63 steps . in lines 1419 of algorithm [ algo : full ] , to ensure that the algorithm samples from the full posterior distribution , we post - process the last state of the subchain using a second - stage acceptance / rejection based on the full posterior distribution .    the second - stage acceptance probability @xmath84 is controlled by the accuracy of the reduced - order model and the subchain length @xmath63 .",
    "ideally , we want to have large @xmath63 to give uncorrelated samples .",
    "however , if the second - stage acceptance probability @xmath84 is low , the effort spent on simulating the subchain will be wasted because the proposal is more likely to be rejected in the second step .",
    "to avoid this situation , we dynamically monitor the accuracy of the reduced - order model by evaluating its error indicator at each state of the subchain ( lines 1012 ) .",
    "the subchain is terminated if the l - infinity norm of the scaled error indicator exceeds a threshold @xmath62 .",
    "lines 2022 of algorithm [ algo : full ] describe the adaptation of the reduced basis , which is controlled by the scaled error ( [ eq : scaled_error ] ) of the reduced - order model and a given threshold @xmath62 .",
    "three criteria must be satisfied for the reduced basis to be updated : ( 1 ) the scaled error at @xmath85 must exceed the threshold @xmath62 ; ( 2 ) the dimensionality of the reduced basis must not exceed the maximum allowable dimensionality @xmath64 ; and ( 3 ) the finite adaptation criterion ( definition  [ fin_a ] ) should not yet be satisfied .",
    "the finite adaptation criterion is defined precisely as follows .",
    "[ fin_a ] finite adaptation criterion .",
    "the average number of mcmc steps used for each reduced basis enrichment exceeds @xmath86 , for some user - specified @xmath87 , where @xmath62 is the error threshold used in algorithm  [ algo : full ] .",
    "the finite adaptation criterion is a threshold for how _ infrequent _ updates to the reduced - order model should become before model adaptation is stopped entirely .",
    "when more and more mcmc steps are used between updates , the reduced - order model has satisfied the accuracy threshold @xmath62 over larger and larger regions of the posterior .",
    "the threshold of at least @xmath88 steps between updates can thus be understood as a measure of `` sufficient coverage '' by the reduced - order model .",
    "further discussion and justification of the finite adaptation criterion is deferred to section 4 .",
    "algorithm [ algo : full ] uses the adaptation in lines 2022 to drive the online construction of the reduced - order model .",
    "once the adaptation stops , the algorithm runs as a standard delayed acceptance algorithm , with an @xmath63-step subchain in the first stage .",
    "to prevent the situation where the reduced basis dimension is large so that the reduced - order model becomes computationally inefficient , we limit the reduced basis dimension to be less than a user - given threshold @xmath64 . when the reduced basis dimension reaches @xmath64 but the finite adaptation criterion is not satisfied , one strategy is to stop the reduced basis enrichment , and continue simulating algorithm [ algo : full ] .",
    "this does not affect the ergodicity of algorithm [ algo : full ] , as will be discussed in section [ sec : convergence ] .",
    "however , the error of the resulting reduced - order model can be large in the subregion of the support of the posterior that remains unexplored .",
    "consequently , this large reduced - order model error may decrease the second - stage acceptance rate and the statistical efficiency of the algorithm .",
    "a wide range of proposal distributions can be used in algorithm [ algo : full ] . in this work ,",
    "we use the grouped - components adaptive metropolis @xcite , which is a variant of adaptive metropolis @xcite .",
    "more advanced algorithms such as stochastic newton @xcite or manifold mcmc @xcite can also be used within algorithm [ algo : full ] .",
    "the computational cost of evaluating derivative information for these algorithms can also be reduced by using the reduced - order models .      throughout this work , the following assumption on the forward model and the reduced - order model",
    "is used :    [ assum:1 ] the forward model @xmath89 , and the reduced - order model @xmath90 are lipschitz continuous and bounded on @xmath91 .",
    "since the data - misfit functions @xmath92 and @xmath93 are quadratic , we have @xmath94 and @xmath95 . assumption [ assum:1 ]",
    "implies that there exists a constant @xmath96 such that @xmath97 we also note that lipschitz continuity of @xmath89 implies the lipschitz continuity of @xmath92 .",
    "similarly , @xmath93 is lipschitz continuous .",
    "we first establish the ergodicity of a non - adaptive version of algorithm [ algo : full ] , where the reduced - order model is assumed to be given and fixed .",
    "[ thm:3 ] in the first stage of algorithm [ algo : full ] , suppose the proposal distribution @xmath98 is @xmath99-irreducible .",
    "then the non - adaptive version of algorithm [ algo : full ] is ergodic .",

    "ergodicity follows from the detailed balance , aperiodicity , and irreducibility .    the adaptation used in algorithm [ algo : full ] is different from that of standard adaptive mcmc algorithms such as @xcite and the original adaptive delayed acceptance algorithm @xcite .",
    "these algorithms carry out an infinite number of adaptations because modifications to the proposal distribution or to the approximation continue throughout mcmc sampling .",
    "the number of adaptations in algorithm [ algo : full ] , on the other hand , can not exceed the maximum allowable dimension @xmath64 of the reduced basis , and hence it is finite .",
    "furthermore , the adaptation stops after finite time because of the finite adaptation criterion .",
    "since algorithm [ algo : full ] is ergodic for each of the reduced - order models constructed by lemma [ thm:3 ] , proposition 2 in @xcite ensures the ergodicity of algorithm [ algo : full ] .",
    "lemma [ thm:3 ] also reveals that algorithm [ algo : full ] always converges to the full posterior distribution , regardless of the accuracy of the reduced - order model .",
    "in algorithm [ algo : full ] , the accuracy of the reduced - order model is adaptively improved during mcmc sampling , and thus it is important to analyze the error of the approximate posterior induced by the reduced - order model , compared to the full posterior .",
    "since bounds on the bias of the resulting monte carlo estimator can be derived from the error of the approximate posterior , this analysis is particularly useful in situations where we want to utilize the approximate posterior directly for further cpu time reduction .",
    "this error analysis also justifies the finite adaptation criterion ( see definition [ fin_a ] ) used in algorithm [ algo : full ] to terminate the enrichment of the reduced basis .",

    ", we have demonstrated that both algorithms are able to accelerate mcmc sampling of computationally expensive posterior distributions by up to two orders of magnitude , and that the sampling accuracy of the @xmath62-approximate algorithm is comparable to that of a reference full - model mcmc .",
    "we have also used the first case study to show the numerical accuracy of the data - driven reduced - order model , compared to a reduced - order model that is built offline with respect to the prior distribution . in this example , for the same number of reduced basis vectors , the posterior - averaged output error of the data - driven reduced - order model is several orders of magnitude smaller than that of the reduced - order model built with respect to the prior .",
    "furthermore , we have demonstrated the impact of the amount of information carried in the observed data on the dimensionality of the reduced basis .    for solving statistical inverse problems , these results suggest that a data - driven reduced - order model is preferable to a reduced - order model built with respect to the prior , especially when the data are informative . even though our approach is designed for constructing projection - based reduced - order models , the concept of building posterior - oriented surrogate models can be generalized to other approximation approaches such as gaussian process regression and generalized polynomial chaos .",

    "<S> one of the major challenges in the bayesian solution of inverse problems governed by partial differential equations ( pdes ) is the computational cost of repeatedly evaluating numerical pde models , as required by markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) methods for posterior sampling . </S>",
    "<S> this paper proposes a data - driven projection - based model reduction technique to reduce this computational cost . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed technique has two distinctive features . </S>",
    "<S> first , the model reduction strategy is tailored to inverse problems : the snapshots used to construct the reduced - order model are computed adaptively from the posterior distribution . </S>",
    "<S> posterior exploration and model reduction are thus pursued simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> second , to avoid repeated evaluations of the full - scale numerical model as in a standard mcmc method , we couple the full - scale model and the reduced - order model together in the mcmc algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> this maintains accurate inference while reducing its overall computational cost . in numerical experiments considering steady - state flow in a porous medium , </S>",
    "<S> the data - driven reduced - order model achieves better accuracy than a reduced - order model constructed using the classical approach . </S>",
    "<S> it also improves posterior sampling efficiency by several orders of magnitude compared to a standard mcmc method . </S>"
