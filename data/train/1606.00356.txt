    "all the stars of mass in the range @xmath5 , after the core he burning phase , evolve through the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) just before the planetary nebula ( pn ) and white dwarf phases .",
    "agb stars are mainly supported by shell h burning but @xmath6 nucleosynthesis is periodically activated in a he - rich layer above the degenerate core .",
    "these periodic episodes are commonly referred to as thermal pulses because the ignition of this nuclear channel occurs under condition of thermal instability @xcite .",
    "the thermally - pulsing ( tp ) phase at the end of the agb is particularly important because nucleosynthesis primarily occurs in this evolutionary stage . during the tp - agb phase , the so - called third dredge - up ( tdu )",
    "brings the products of h and he burning to the stellar surface , increasing the c / o ratio over unity and forming c - rich agb stars . in the more massive ( say , m",

    "* ) , keeping the c / o ratio below unity .",
    "agb stars play a significant role in several astrophysical contexts : i ) they are used to infer the masses of galaxies at high redshifts @xcite because of their large ir luminosities ; ii ) they provide an important contribution to the light elements enrichment of the interstellar medium ( ism ) in our milky way galaxy and other galaxies @xcite due to their high gas pollution capability via stellar winds ; iii ) agbs , because of the efficiency of the dust formation process in their winds , play a crucial role in the formation and evolution of galaxies @xcite , proving essential for the understanding of the dust content in high - redshift quasars @xcite ; iv ) the more massive hbb agb stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are currently believed to have provided the gas required to form second - generation stars in globular clusters @xcite .",
    "the above arguments represent only some examples , showing why the agb evolutionary phase , despite lasting only a tiny fraction of the whole life of a star , is at the center of the astrophysical debate .",
    "addressing the afore mentioned topics requires full knowledge of the agb evolution properties , and a detailed description of the gas and dust yields provided by these objects .",
    "agb modelling has been significantly improved in the last few years ; the last generation of agb models also include a description of the dust formation process @xcite .",
    "this opens the possibility of determining the dust produced by agbs , in terms of the chemical composition of the dust particles formed , the dust mass budget and the grain size distribution .",
    "the reliability of the results presented so far , somewhat quantified through the differences among the model results of the different groups involved in this research , is not satisfactory though .",
    "this is primarily due to the poor knowledge of convection and mass loss , still modelled via semi - empirical descriptions and that deeply affect the results obtained @xcite .",
    "because we are still far from a self - consistent and physically sound treatment of both mechanisms , still based on first principles , the best way to make a significant step forward into this direction is the comparison between the theoretical predictions and the astronomical observations .",
    "the chemistry of pne is the result of the several nucleosynthesis processes that modify the stellar chemical composition during the previous agb phase .",
    "thus , pne - which can be observed at large distances and the nebular gas abundances can be derived - turn out to be particularly useful objects in order to test the agb theoretical models @xcite .",
    "some species such as c and n ( to a more limited extend o ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are greatly altered during the earlier agb phase , while another ones like cl remain almost constant to values typical of the original ism . for these reasons we started a project dedicated to the comparison between the observations of pne and the surface chemical composition of agb models in the latest evolutionary phases , with the ultimate goal of putting additonal constraints on the description of the agb phase .    in the first two papers of this series @xcite we focused on the pne sample of the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc ) ; these works offered an interesting opportunity to complete , from a different perspective , the analysis focused on the interpretation of the _ spitzer _ sample of agbs in the same galaxies @xcite .",
    "the analysis by @xcite , based on the observed chemical composition , particularly of the cn abundances , allowed a characterisation of the pne observed in terms of formation epoch and progenitor s metallicity and mass ; this investigation provided interesting information regarding the efficiency of the processes able to alter the surface chemistry of agbs , particularly at the low metallicities typical of the stars in the magellanic clouds .    in this paper",
    "we make a step forward , extending our analysis to higher metallicities and comparing our new model predictions at solar and supersolar metallicities with the sample of galactic pne recently studied by @xcite .",
    "the @xcite work is based on high - quality optical spectra in conjunction with the best available ionization correction factors ( icfs ) , which allowed an accurate determination of the nebular abundances of he , c , n , o , and cl .",
    "it is to be noted here that : i ) their spectra are deep enough to detect weak lines ( such as the o recombination lines ) and have a higher resolution ( @xmath114  ; adequate to avoid blends ) than most works in the literature ( usually @xmath77  ) ; ii ) they used the most recent icfs @xcite , which seem to work better ( for most elements ) than the commonly adopted @xcite ones ; iii ) apart from the usual uncertainties from the line fluxes , they also considered the uncertainties associated with the icfs ; this gives larger uncertainties ( as compared to the literature ; e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) but their total abundances are more realistic ; and iv ) their sample pne have available space - based mid - ir spectra and can be classified depending on the dust features ( e.g. , c - rich or o - rich ) , which provide an independent proxy for the nature of the pne progenitors . indeed , we have recently compared the model predictions presented here with the @xcite sub - sample of low - metallicity galactic pne with c - rich dust , obtaining a nice agreement between the models and the observational results of o self enrichment in this type of pne @xcite .",
    "thus , the goals of the present paper are the detailed presentation of the new agb model predictions for the hecno elements at solar / supersolar metallicity as well as their comparison with the @xcite samples of higher metallicity galactic pne with double- ( both c- and o - rich ) and o - chemistry dust in their _ spitzer space telescope _ and/or _ infrared space observatory _ mid - ir spectra .",
    "we describe the numerical and physical input of the agb models as well as the evolution of the surface chemistry ( focussed on the cno elements ) during the agb in sections 2 and 3 , respectively .",

    "the cn 1 - 5 ir spectrum display very strong pah - like features and unidentified 24 @xmath19 m emission ; curiously , this is the only dc object in our sample with c / o@xmath31 ( but also consistent , within the errors , with c / o@xmath111 ) .",
    "the cn 1 - 5 c / o ratio is higher than one using both recombination lines ( rls ) and collisionally excited lines ( cels ) @xcite , suggesting a true c - rich gas nebula .",

    "however , as already pointed out by @xcite and @xcite , less massive ( @xmath113.5 m@xmath2 ) non - hbb stars could also produce the high he and n / o ratios observed in dc pne via extra mixing , stellar rotation , binary interaction , or even he pre - enrichment .",
    "interestingly , mycn 18 and m 1 - 42 ( and m 2 - 27 ) seem to be examples of objects at the lower and higher end , respectively , of the agb progenitor masses covered by dc pne in the he vs. n / o plane .",
    "the pn mycn 18 seems to be the descendant of a solar metallicity @xmath13.5 m@xmath2 agb progenitor , formed @xmath1250 myr ago .",
    "the chemical composition of pne m 1 - 42 and m 2 - 27 , however , clearly reflects the effects of hbb , because they are enriched in n and have an o content significantly smaller than the average value of other sample pne at similar metallicities .",
    "furthermore , they are the two pne with the highest he abundances , suggesting that they descend from stars of mass @xmath21 and metallicity slightly subsolar ( m 1 - 42 ) and supersolar ( m 2 - 27 ) .",
    "the evolutionary times of agb stars of this mass and metallicity indicate a relatively recent formation epoch , between 40 and 80 myr ago . according to our modelling",
    ", these stars should belong to group ( i ) in section [ change ] , thus their chemical composition should show - up the imprinting of hbb , with no signatures of tdu .",
    "however , the recommended c / o ratios are at odds with this hypothesis , as they are a factor @xmath22 higher than predicted ( see left , bottom panel of fig .  [ fpne ] ) , suggesting some contribution from tdu . this possibility was advanced by @xcite , to explain the rb overabundances observed in massive galactic agb stars , undergoing hbb .    still in the context of massive agbs , @xcite outlined that some of the pne in the lmc can be interpreted as the progeny of @xmath23 stars , whose surface chemistry was contaminated exclusively by hbb .",
    "clearly the comparison among the two samples is not straightforward , because the metallicities of the pne are different .",
    "however , confirmation of the c / o values provided by @xcite would suggest larger effects from tdu in solar / supersolar metallicity massive agb stars . in the context of our modelling",
    ", larger tdu effects would indicate that the mass - loss rate in our massive agb models of solar and supersolar metallicity is too high .",
    "alternatively , the true c / o ratios of m 1 - 42 and m 2 - 27 could be smaller than the @xcite recommended values , thus rendering the agreement with the models more satisfactory .    in short",
    ", the comparison with the aton models suggests that : i ) the lowest metallicity oc pne should be the descendants of low - mass ( @xmath11 m@xmath2 ) stars that are not converted into c - rich stars , while the higher metallicity oc ones ( with uncertain dust classifications and dc - like chemical compositions ) could be truly dc pne where the pah - like features may have escaped detection in the available mid - ir space - based spectroscopic observations ; ii ) solar / supersolar metallicity dc pne should be the descendants of the higher mass ( m @xmath33.5 m@xmath2 ) hbb agb stars but alternative channels of formation can not be discarded with the present nebular abundances and their associated errors .",
    "we use agb models ( with diffusive overshooting from all the convective borders ) of different metallicity ( from @xmath24/4 to 2z@xmath2 ) to interpret the surface chemistry ( he , c , n , o , and cl ) of a sample of galactic pne with high - quality spectra , which together with the best icfs available allowed abundance determinations with unprecedented accuracy / reliability @xcite .",
    "the pne investigated are divided among double - dust chemistry ( dc ) and oxygen - dust chemistry ( oc ) according to the dust features present in their available space - based ir spectra .    unlike the @xcite subsample of carbon - dust chemistry ( cc )",
    "pne recently analysed by us @xcite , here the individual abundance errors ( in particular for the c / o ratio ) , the wider metallicity range , and the uncertain dust types / subtypes in some objects do not permit a clear determination of the agb initial mass ( and the formation epoch ) for both pne samples .",
    "the pne observations versus agb models comparison is thus more focussed on a star - by - star basis .",
    "the two lowest metallicity oc pne ( dddm 1 and ngc 6210 ) are interpreted as the descendants of low - mass ( @xmath11 m@xmath2 ) agb stars that did not reach the c - rich phase .",
    "the three higher metallicity pne in this group ( m 2 - 42 , ngc 3132 and ngc 6543 ) have uncertain dust classifications and are chemically indistinguishable from the rest of dc pne in our sample , being interpreted as truly dc pne where the pah - like features may have escaped detection by the _ spitzer _ and _ iso _ satellites .",
    "the dc pne in our galaxy may display different kind of ir spectra and , sometimes , even c / o ratios over unity ( e.g. , cn 1 - 5 ) .",
    "however , we still lack complete samples of galactic dc pne with precise c / o ratios .",
    "we find that the dc pne in our sample are best separated ( in terms of progenitor agb masses ) in the he vs. n / o plane , which otherwise suggests that they mostly descend from the higher mass ( m @xmath33.5 m@xmath2 ) hbb agb stars at solar / supersolar metallicity .",
    "this is consistent with recent works in the literature , and also we can not discard alternative formation channels in low - mass non - hbb stars such as extra mixing , stellar rotation , binary interaction , or he pre - enrichment .",
    "more precise c / o ratios turn out to be fundamental to learn about the stellar origin of dc pne .",
    "the dc pn mycn 18 seems to be at the lower end ( @xmath13.5 m@xmath2 ) of the agb progenitor masses covered by the dc pne in our sample . on the other hand , two dc pne ( m 1 - 42 and m 2 - 27 ) are likely descendants of the more massive agb stars of close - to - solar chemistry , with mass @xmath25 , formed @xmath26 myr ago",
    "this is deduced on the basis of the large content of n and he , and the low o. the recommended c / o ratio of these two objects ( @xmath27 ) , if confirmed , suggests a role by tdu in the contamination of the surface chemistry during the previous agb phase .",
    "this is at odds with our agb model predictions , giving a significantly smaller @xmath28 , with only a modest contamination from tdu .",
    "also , confirmation of this finding would indicate an intrinsic difference among the evolution of massive agbs , likely progenitors of the dc pne studied here , and their lower metallicity counterparts in the magellanic clouds , which , as shown by @xcite , are contaminated by hbb only . a more robust determination of the c / o ratio of these two particular pne is a promising opportunity to assess any possible contribution of tdu in altering the surface chemical composition of massive agb stars in solar and supersolar environments .",

    "<S> we present nucleosynthesis predictions ( hecnocl ) from asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) models , with diffusive overshooting from all the convective borders , in the metallicity range @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> they are compared to recent precise nebular abundances in a sample of galactic planetary nebulae ( pne ) that is divided among double - dust chemistry ( dc ) and oxygen - dust chemistry ( oc ) according to the infrared dust features . unlike the similar subsample of galactic carbon - dust chemistry pne recently analysed by us , here </S>",
    "<S> the individual abundance errors , the higher metallicity spread , and the uncertain dust types / subtypes in some pne do not allow a clear determination of the agb progenitor masses ( and formation epochs ) for both pne samples ; the comparison is thus more focussed on a object - by - object basis . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest metallicity oc pne evolve from low - mass ( @xmath11 m@xmath2 ) o - rich agbs , while the higher metallicity ones ( all with uncertain dust classifications ) display a chemical pattern similar to the dc pne . in agreement with recent literature , </S>",
    "<S> the dc pne mostly descend from high - mass ( m @xmath33.5 m@xmath2 ) solar / supersolar metallicity agbs that experience hot bottom burning ( hbb ) , but other formation channels in low - mass agbs like extra mixing , stellar rotation , binary interaction , or he pre - enrichment can not be disregarded until more accurate c / o ratios would be obtained . </S>",
    "<S> two objects among the dc pne show the imprint of advanced cno processing and deep second dredge - up , suggesting progenitors masses close to the limit to evolve as core collapse supernovae ( above @xmath4 ) . their actual c / o ratio , if confirmed , indicate contamination from the third dredge - up , rejecting the hypothesis that the chemical composition of such high - metallicity massive agbs is modified exclusively by hbb .    </S>",
