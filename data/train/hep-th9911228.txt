    "we have shown that the partition function of the lattice version of @xmath0 action with vanishing holonomy constraint leads to the product of 15-@xmath1 symbols with some particular combinations of angular momentum factors and regularized constants .",
    "we have then explicitly proved by graphical method that the partition function is pachner move invariant if we take particular choice of sign assignments for the trivalent vertices of decuplet diagrams corresponding to the 4-simplexes .",
    "this means that the partition function is independent of how the simplicial manifold is divided by 4-simplexes .",
    "this is to do with the fact that the partition function of the lattice version of @xmath0 action is diffeomorphism invariant or even topological invariant in a stronger sense .",
    "since the partition function is invariant how much finely we divide the 4-dimensional simplicial manifold in consideration , the continuum limit of the lattice @xmath0 action is expected to approach naively to the continuum @xmath0 action .",
    "the vanishing holonomy constraint can be then interpreted as a gauge fixing condition to align the @xmath31 field and the curvature @xmath32 .",
    "there are some desirable features in this formulation .",
    "firstly we have found the lattice formulation of `` 4-dimensional gravity '' which is first order formalism and is thus described by local variable @xmath2 and spin connection @xmath33 .",
    "this is the first 4-dimensional example of lattice gravity model which specifies the location of the local fields @xmath2 which could possibly be related to the metric and the lattice spin connection @xmath33 on the 4-dimensional simplicial manifold .",
    "this lattice formulation is a beautiful unification of the idea of lattice qcd and the formulation of regge calculus in the sense that the curvature generated by the product of link variables are concentrated on the simplexes where regge calculus claims as the location of gravitational curvature .",
    "secondly the magnitude of the @xmath2 field is naturally discretized due to the logarithmic form of our lattice @xmath0 action .",
    "thus the discreteness of the area of triangles on the original lattice is a natural consequence of the action .",
    "it should be compared with the result of rovelli and smolin who claimed to get the discreteness of the area of triangles in the form @xmath34 from the analysis of an area operator@xcite .    as we have already pointed out that the identification of @xmath35 renders the @xmath0 action into the palatini type of einstein - hilbert action . on the other hand in our @xmath0 action",
    "we have taken the gauge algebra as one of the chiral counter part of @xmath36 algebra in the decomposition of the euclidean local lorentz group , @xmath37 .",
    "there are several possibilities how the chiral decomposition of the local lorentz group be related to the realistic einstein - hilbert action@xcite . here",
    "we simply comment an interesting possibility that the action @xmath38 with the gauge group as one of the chiral partner @xmath39 will be formulated on the original lattice as in this paper while the action @xmath40 with the other chiral partner @xmath41 gauge group will be formulated on the dual lattice .",
    "this situation can be symbolically be written @xmath42",
    "= z_{lbf}[su(2)_l ] \\cdot z_{lbf}[su(2)_r ] .",
    "\\nonumber\\ ] ] in order that this theory be realistic lattice gravity model , we need some natural constraint to relate the two chiral @xmath0 models . as we have mentioned in the end of section 3 , the vanishing holonomy constraint ( [ constraint1 ] ) includes 9 relations for the chiral partner of the @xmath36 algebra , which is just the necessary irreducible degrees of freedom for the 1-form gauge parameter . in order to count the number of the constraint",
    ", we have assumed the chiral nature even for the spacetime suffix in addition to the local lorentz gauge suffix .",
    "in fact there are 9 other constraints in the vanishing holonomy constraint , which may correspond to the number of constraints of the spacetime suffix of the other chiral partner .",
    "it is interesting to note that the vanishing holonomy constraint ( [ constraint1 ] ) may include both constraint in one relation , which might give some clue to find a realistic lattice gravity model .",
    "our proposed lattice @xmath0 action ( [ lbf ] ) can be generalized into arbitrary dimensions .",
    "in fact @xmath43 chern - simons gravity was formulated by the 3-dimensional version of lattice @xmath0 action .",
    "we claim that @xmath44-dimensional lattice @xmath0 action has the universal structure @xmath45 \\right ) , \\nonumber\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is ( @xmath47)-form located on the center of ( @xmath47)-simplex , @xmath48 , in the @xmath44-dimensional simplicial manifold .",
    "the lattice curvature term is defined in the similar way as the 3- and 4-dimensional cases .",
    "it should be noted that the center of the dual plaquette @xmath49 coincides with the center of the simplex @xmath48 .",
    "the vanishing holonomy constraint may have the form either the type of ( [ econstraint ] ) or the type ( [ constraint1 ] ) depending on the suffix structure of gauge group for @xmath50 .",
    "it is worth to recognize at this stage that this lattice @xmath0 action is the lattice version of the leading term in the generalized chern - simons action in @xmath44 dimensions .    in our lattice gravity formulation in 3 and 4 dimensions , 1- and 2-form fields are , respectively , introduced on 1- and 2-simplexes in the simplicial manifold : @xmath51 and @xmath31 are located on the link ( 1-simplex ) and the triangle ( 2-simplex ) of original lattice , respectively , while @xmath33 is located on the dual link ( 1-simplex ) .",
    "there is thus natural correspondence between the form degrees and the simplex numbers .",
    "the generalized gauge theory which is formulated to include all form degrees may thus very naturally be fitting to the formulation of gauge theory on the simplicial manifold .",
    "we know that there is no dynamical graviton in the topological model while we need the graviton as a dynamical field in the realistic 4-dimensional einstein gravity .",
    "we believe that matter fields should be introduced to accommodate the dynamical degrees of freedom and thus would change the topological nature of the model . we know by now that the ghosts introduced by the quantization will be changed into fermionic matter fields via twisting mechanism@xcite .",
    "in fact we found a mechanism that @xmath52 symmetry of @xmath53 supersymmetry in the twist is essentially related to the dirac - khler fermion formulation@xcite .",
    "the dirac - khler fermion needs all form degrees of freedom and can naturally be put on the simplicial manifold",
    ".    it will be thus interesting to investigate lattice gravity formulation with matter fields on the simplicial manifold .",
    "we know that weak boson gauge field and higgs field can be very naturally accommodated into the generalized gauge theory formulation and thus this kind of formulation possibly leads to the unified model on the simplicial manifold@xcite .    in our formulation",
    "we have introduced cut off dependent regularized constant .",
    "it is well known by the work of turaev and viro that the regularization of the ponzano - regge model can be naturally accommodated if we introduce the @xmath54-deformed formulation of 3-@xmath1 symbol@xcite .",
    "we did nt mention the @xmath54-deformed version of the present formulation in this paper although it is the main subject among mathematicians to obtain the 4-dimensional topological invariant by the @xmath54-deformed formulation@xcite .",
    "since our 15-@xmath1 symbol is explicitly related to the 3-@xmath1 symbol which has the @xmath54-deformed counterpart , it will be straightforward to generalize our formulation into @xmath54-deformed version , which is expected to correspond with @xmath0 gravity with cosmological term@xcite@xcite .",
