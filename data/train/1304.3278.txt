    "the complex fermion determinant at finite chemical potential has slowed down the progress in the exploration of the qcd phase diagram using lattice qcd . among the different techniques to deal with the sign problem ( see e.g. @xcite ) , the dual representation is a powerful method which can help us to solve the sign problem without making any approximation of the partition sum as in other methods . before approaching the ultimate goal of finding a dual representation for non - abelian gauge theories with only positive probability weights , which is a rather involved task and has not been achieved yet , it is advisable to explore and understand the method in simpler models , such as abelian theories coupled to scalar fields @xcite that we study here .",

    "to perform the monte carlo simulation of the system we developed the swa and we compared its performance against a local update ( lma ) @xcite .",
    "the lma consists of :    * a sweep of the unconstrained variables @xmath15 rising or lowering their occupation number by one unit . *",

    "the constraints are temporarily violated at a link @xmath34 , the head of the worm , and the two sites at its endpoints .",

    "[ worm ] ) .",
    "@xmath35 becomes the head of the worm @xmath34 .",
    "the defect at @xmath34 is then propagated through the lattice by attaching segments , which are chosen in such a way that the constraints are always obeyed ( 2 in fig .  [ worm ] ) .",
