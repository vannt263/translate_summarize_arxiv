    "the gravitational lens system sdss j0924 + 0219 presents a fascinating challenge for lens modelers .",
    "discovered by @xcite , images from the sloan digital sky survey showed what appeared to be a triple system in a very odd configuration .",
    "the lensing galaxy could be seen in higher resolution follow - up observations obtained with the baade telescope at las campanas observatory , which in combination with the three known images called for a fourth image .",
    "modeling and subtracting the three bright images ( a , b , and c ) did reveal a fourth image , d , but it was a factor of 10 fainter than predicted .",
    "the image positions are typical of an `` inclined quad '' or `` fold '' configuration produced by a source near a fold caustic ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so images a and d ought to be nearly equal in brightness ( see * ? ? ?",
    "anomalies in lens flux ratios are possible when there is small - scale structure in the lensing galaxy , in the form of either dark matter subhalos ( millilensing ; e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or stars ( microlensing ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the challenge is to understand whether either possibility can actually explain why image d is so faint . one might hope to discriminate between milli- and microlensing by observing a component of the qso that is large compared to the einstein rings of stars but small compared to the einstein rings of subhalos @xcite .",
    "we therefore obtained broad emission line flux ratios for sdss j0924 + 0219 using the hubble space telescope .",
    "we describe our observations in  2 , our analysis in  3 , and our conclusions in  4 .",
    "we assume a cosmology with @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 .",
    "the redshift of the source quasar is @xmath6 @xcite , and the redshift of the lens galaxy is @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "sdss0924 was observed with the wide field channel ( wfc ) of the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on the hubble space telescope , as part of program go-9744 ( pi  c.  kochanek ) .",
    "four 547-sec exposures were obtained with the f555w filter ( @xmath8v ) on 18 november 2003 , and four 574-sec exposures were obtained with the f814w ( @xmath8i ) on 19 november 2003 .",
    "an interpolated color composite of the v- and i - band images is shown in figure  [ fig : acs]a .",
    "the four qso components and the lens galaxy are clearly visible .",
    "an einstein ring image of the qso host galaxy is also apparent in the i - band image .",
    "we performed a non - linear least squares fit to the flattened frames from standard acs data processing , using a photometric model consisting of four point sources and a de vaucouleurs model galaxy , convolved with a tinytim psf ( * ? ? ?",
    "we fit each exposure separately and used the scatter among exposures to assess the measurement uncertainties . for the galaxy",

    "the observations were attempted on 19 june 2004 , but guide star acquisition failed .",
    "we arranged to reobserve sdss0924 with the same setup , but the power supply to stis was shut down before the new observations were carried out .",

    "the relative wavelength was given by the ground calibration of acs @xcite , and we shifted the wavelength scale of each spectrum to match the obvious emission features ( ly@xmath0/ , ly@xmath31/ , ) present in the qso dispersed images .",
    "the spectrum of each qso image was constructed by a simple boxcar extraction in each column with a boxcar half - width in pixels given by @xmath32 .",
    "the count rate in each spectral pixel was converted to flux using sensitivity tables produced from ground calibrations .",
    "the extracted spectra are shown in figure  [ fig : spec ] .",
    "we fit a simple five parameter model composed of a linear continuum and a gaussian emission line to each spectrum over the range 11201460   in the qso frame , covering the ly@xmath0/ broad emission line .",
    "the fits are shown in figure  [ fig : spec ] , and the line and continuum fluxes are listed in table  [ tab : data ] as @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "we also report the average continuum flux level over the rest wavelength range 16001800   as @xmath35 .    figure  [ fig : acs]b shows that the spectra for images a and d pass fairly close to the center of the galaxy . to assess systematic effects due to the galaxy subtraction",
    ", we repeated the measurements with both 5% more and less galaxy subtracted .",
    "all of the spectral flux measurements in table  [ tab : data ] varied by less than 5% , with the exception of the continuum measurement @xmath34 for image d which varied by 20% .",
    "one other possible systematic effect is that @xmath35 may contain a small amount ( @xmath365% ) of broad line flux , but that should not affect our conclusions .",
    "sdss0924 is anomalous not just in broad - band photometry but also in the continuum and broad emission line flux ratios .",
    "moreover , the anomalies are different in different passbands : @xmath37 is 10 in the emission line , 1416 in the broad - band filters , and @xmath3819 in the continuum . that the broad - band values lie between the emission line and continuum values makes sense if the broad - band filters contain both continuum and emission line light .",
    "( we estimate that @xmath3910% of the v - band flux is from broad emission lines , while the i - band contains @xmath3920% emission line flux including the 3000   bump . ) for comparison , the values for @xmath40 are 5.6 in the emission line , 2.62.9 in the broad - band filters , and @xmath389 in the continuum . that the broad - band values lie below both the emission line and continuum values",
    "may seem puzzling .",
    "however , we must recall that the photometry and spectroscopy come from different epochs , and image c has faded since november 2003 @xcite such that the broad - band ratio is presently @xmath41 .",
    "optical broad - band photometry shows that the images vary independently and on a time scale of years @xcite , which is long compared with the predicted time delays ( see  3.2 ) and therefore implies that microlensing is present .",
    "microlensing can also explain why the emission line and continuum flux ratios differ , as we shall demonstrate ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "what remains is to explain why the emission line flux ratios are anomalous .",
    "we initially suspected millilensing , but then realized that we would need at least two clumps since both c and d have anomalous emission line flux ratios .",
    "since we know that microlensing is present , a simpler hypothesis is that microlensing produces all of the anomalies .",
    "we will show that microlensing can indeed explain the data for sdss0924 .",
    "one obvious question is whether microlensing has the right scale to affect broad emission lines .",
    "the source plane einstein radius of a star of mass @xmath42 is @xmath43 for comparison , reverberation mapping studies have shown that the broad line regions of active galactic nuclei span a range of sizes but certainly extend down to @xmath3910 lt - days and below ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the comparison is not perfect because reverberation mapping studies have focused on balmer lines ( especially h@xmath31 ) while we have observed ly@xmath0 , and because reverberation mapping and microlensing are probably sensitive to source geometry in different ways .",
    "nevertheless , it appears that the microlensing scale is not grossly inappropriate .      for a microlensing analysis",
    "we need to estimate the convergence and shear at the position of each image .",
    "we treat the lens galaxy as a singular isothermal ellipsoid whose surface mass density ( in units of the critical density for lensing ) can be written as @xmath44^{1/2 } , \\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the projected axis ratio , @xmath46 is the orientation angle , and @xmath47 is a mass parameter related to the einstein radius of the lens .",
    "we constrain the center of the mass distribution using the observed galaxy position .",
    "we optimize @xmath47 and @xmath45 , but fix @xmath46 to match the orientation of the observed galaxy ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we include an external tidal shear to allow for the possibility that the environment of the lens galaxy ( which is currently unknown ) affects the lens potential ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we fit the image and galaxy positions ( not the flux ratios , since they are the subject of the microlensing analysis ) .",
    "the best - fit model has @xmath48 for @xmath49 degrees of freedom , which is dominated by the galaxy position suggesting that we may have underestimated its uncertainty .",
    "( eliminating the galaxy position constraint leads to @xmath50 . ) allowing the orientation to be free would yield @xmath51 for @xmath52 , again dominated by the galaxy position , but this model has a misalignment of @xmath53 between the mass and the light so we deem it to be implausible .",
    "the model has an axis ratio @xmath54 , which is not very different from the observed axis ratio @xmath55 .",
    "it has an external shear @xmath56 at position angle @xmath57 ( east of north ) ; such a shear is typical for four - image lenses and suggests that the lens may lie in a modest group of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the predicted convergence @xmath58 , shear @xmath59 , and magnification @xmath60 for each image are listed in table  [ tab : kapgam ] .",
    "the predicted time delays between the images are all less than 12 days .",
    "thus , independent variability in the images on a time scale of years can not be attributed to intrinsic variability of the source .",

    "the image will be split into several `` microimages '' separated by a distance comparable to the star s einstein radius @xmath65 . on this tiny scale",
    "the effects of the galaxy can be approximated as a constant convergence @xmath58 and shear @xmath59 , so that the lens equation can be written as @xmath66 in coordinates centered on the star and aligned with the shear .",

    ", there are two additional microimages at @xmath75 and @xmath76 , each having magnification @xmath77 $ ] . ] since the microimages are not separately resolved , what matters is the combined magnification @xmath78 $ ] ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "using the convergence and shear values from table  [ tab : kapgam ] yields @xmath79 , which corresponds to a flux ratio @xmath80 .    for imperfect alignment , we can still solve the lens equation analytically if the source lies on the @xmath81-axis or @xmath82-axis ( see appendix b.1 of @xcite for details ) .",
    "for a source lying a distance @xmath83 from the origin along either axis , we find @xmath84 .",
    "clearly microlensing can cause image d to be very faint , if there is a star reasonably close to the macroimage .",
    "going beyond the toy model , we face three important questions : ( 1 ) when the density of stars is low ( so their caustics do not intersect ) , how likely is it that there is a star close enough to the macroimage to produce strong flux perturbations ?",
    "( 2 ) as the density of stars increases ( so their caustics merge ) , is it still possible to get a strong demagnification ? ( 3 ) how do the conclusions differ for point - like and finite sources ?",
    "to answer these questions , we run microlensing simulations using the ray shooting software by @xcite .",
    "we use the convergences and shears from table  [ tab : kapgam ] , and assume that a fraction @xmath85 of the surface mass density is in stars .",
    "the software produces a magnification map for each image . treating the continuum region as a point source ,",
    "we can make a histogram of the magnifications in the map to obtain the probability distribution for the continuum magnification . given a model of the broad line region , we can convolve the magnification map with that model before making the histogram to obtain the probability distribution for the emission line magnification .",
    "we treat the blr as a gaussian with half - light radius @xmath86 , since @xcite argue that details other than the half - light radius do not significantly affect microlensing magnification distributions .",
    "examples of the distributions are shown in figure  [ fig : magdist ] .    to analyze both continuum and emission line flux ratios",
    ", we must determine the joint probability distribution @xmath87 for the continuum and emission line magnifications of each image .",
    "for each source position , we take @xmath88 from the raw magnification map and @xmath89 from the convolved map , and then use all pixels to construct a histogram in the @xmath90 plane .    finally , to simultaneously analyze images a and d we compute the four - dimensional probability distribution . ]",
    "@xmath91 this represents the probability density for image a to have continuum and emission line magnifications of @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively , while image d has @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the joint four - dimensional distribution is just the product of the two two - dimensional distributions because microlensing is independent in the two images .    to quantify microlensing s ability to explain our data for sdss0924 , we then compute @xmath96 this represents the probability that , if we picked a four - image lens at random , it would be at least as anomalous as what we have observed .",
    "this is not really the right figure of merit for evaluating our data , though , because we did not select sdss0924 at random ; we chose it specifically because it is the most anomalous of the 22 known four - image lenses",
    ". a better figure of merit is the probability @xmath97 of finding at least one strong anomaly in a sample of @xmath98 four - image lenses .",
    "unfortunately , it is not clear how to compute @xmath97 . for @xmath98 identical lenses",
    ", the binomial distribution would give @xmath99 ( for @xmath100 ) .",
    "the known lenses are not identical , but short of doing microlensing simulations for all of them ( interesting , certainly , but beyond the scope of this work ) we must assume that the value of @xmath101 for sdss0924 is representative .",
    "next , we must determine an appropriate value for @xmath98 .",
    "there are 16 four - image lenses with `` fold '' or `` cusp '' configurations , in which a close pair or triplet of images can be analyzed in a robust , model - independent way to find flux ratio anomalies @xcite .",
    "we therefore set @xmath102 , and consider this to be somewhat conservative since we are neglecting the non - fold / cusp images in these 16 lenses as well as all images in the six known `` cross '' lenses .",
    "lastly , we must decide what value of @xmath97 represents a reasonable threshold of acceptability .",
    "since we are dealing with complicated posterior probabilities we should avoid being too demanding , so we believe it is reasonable to consider @xmath103 , or @xmath104 .    figure  [ fig : prob ] shows @xmath101 as a function of the half - light radius of the broad - line region , for different values of the stellar mass fraction @xmath85 .",
    "there are acceptable models with the blr as large as @xmath105 , for a stellar mass fraction of @xmath10620% .",
    "a larger broad - line region is ruled out by these models .",
    "a smaller broad - line region would allow a wider range of stellar mass fractions .",
    "thus , we conclude that there is a range of microlensing models with reasonable parameters that can explain the flux ratio anomaly in sdss0924 acceptably well .",
    "there are two limitations to our present analysis .",
    "first , we assumed for simplicity that the stellar mass fraction is the same for images a and d. second , we assumed that all the stars have the same mass .",
    "the stellar mass function has very little effect on the magnification distribution for a point source ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the same result can not hold for an extended source , because a large source must not be sensitive to stars that are sufficiently small , but the problem of microlensing of a finite source by unequal - mass stars has not yet been studied .",
    "relaxing our two assumptions should only make it _ easier _ to find microlensing models that fit the data , which means that they do not affect our main conclusion that microlensing can provide a reasonable explanation for sdss0924 .",
    "we have discovered that the continuum and broad emission line flux ratios in sdss0924 differ from each other at the factor of two level ( for both images c and d ) .",
    "that fact , together with photometric variability @xcite , establishes that microlensing is present in this system .",
    "we have also found that image d is highly anomalous in both the continuum and the broad emission line fluxes .",
    "we have shown that all of these results can be explained by microlensing .",
    "the key point is that saddle images can be strongly suppressed by microlensing .",
    "the suppression is generally greater for a point source than for an extended source , which is why images c and d are fainter ( relative to a ) in the continuum than in the emission line .",
    "even so , microlensing can produce a factor of 10 suppression in the emission line flux of image d , provided that the qso broad emission line region has a half - light radius @xmath1 lt - days . while this result suggests that @xmath86 is smaller than we thought broad - line regions to be when we began our project ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it seems reasonable in light of results from reverberation mapping of active galactic nuclei ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "that is all we can say without a detailed understanding of geometric factors that may make sizes measured from microlensing different from those measured by reverberation mapping .",
    "but it is enough for our proof of principle that microlensing is sufficient to explain all current data for sdss0924 .",
    "we believe that microlensing offers the best and most natural explanation for sdss0924 , but concede that we can not rigorously rule millilensing out . testing whether millilensing is present will require new data , such as flux ratios in narrow emission lines ( the narrow line region is generally thought to be large ; e.g. , @xcite ; but see @xcite for a contrasting view ) or mid - infrared photometry ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "another intriguing possibility is spectroscopic variability .",
    "if there is only microlensing , then over the next few years image d ought to return to the brightness predicted by smooth lens models  in both the continuum and emission line .",
    "if there is any millilensing , then differences between observed and smooth model flux ratios will persist for centuries .",
