    "randomness extraction is the art of generating ( almost ) uniform randomness from any weakly random source @xmath0 .",
    "more precisely , a _ randomness extractor _ ( or , simply _ extractor _ ) is a function @xmath1 that takes as input @xmath0 together with a uniformly distributed ( and usually short ) string @xmath2 , called the _ seed _ , and outputs a string @xmath3 .",
    "one then requires @xmath3 to be almost uniformly distributed whenever the min - entropy of @xmath0 is larger than some threshold @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath5 the min - entropy of a random variable @xmath0 is directly related to the probability of correctly guessing the value of @xmath0 using an optimal strategy : @xmath6 .",
    "hence can be interpreted operationally : if the maximum probability of successfully guessing the input of the extractor , @xmath0 , is sufficiently low then its output is statistically close to uniform .    in most applications , such as privacy amplification  @xcite , or",
    "simply when applying two extractors in succession to the same input @xmath0 , there is a notion of _ side information _ , which describes the information about the input which is contained in the environment , or accessible to an adversary .",
    "notions of randomness such as the _ guessing probability _ , _ min - entropy _ or the _ uniformity _ of a random variable naturally always depend on the side information relative to which they are defined , and in particular one would like the output of the extractor to be uniform _ with respect to the side information_. hence we may make this requirement explicit in our formulation of by denoting by @xmath7 all side information with respect to which the extractor s output should be uniform : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the conditional min - entropy , formally defined in .",
    "this conditioning naturally extends the operational interpretation of the min - entropy to scenarios with side information , i.e. , @xmath10 is the maximum probability of correctly guessing @xmath0 , given access to side information @xmath7  @xcite . interestingly ,",
    "the relationship between the two criteria   and depends on the physical nature of the side information @xmath7 , i.e. , whether @xmath7 is represented by the state of a classical or a quantum system . in the case of purely classical side information",
    ", @xmath7 may be modeled as a random variable and it is known that the two criteria are essentially equivalent ( see for a precise statement ) .",
    "but in the general case where @xmath7 is a quantum system , is _ strictly stronger _ than  : it was shown in  @xcite that there exist extractors that fulfill   but for which   fails ( see also  @xcite for a discussion ) .    since our world is inherently non - classical , it is of particular importance that   rather than the weaker   be taken as the relevant criterion for the definition of extractors .",
    "for example , in the context of cryptography , one typically uses extractors to generate secret keys , i.e. , randomness that is uniform from an adversary s point of view .",
    "even if the extractor itself is classical , nothing can prevent an adversary from storing information @xmath7 in a quantum system , so does not imply security .",
    "randomness recycling is another simple example involving quantum side information .",
    "if we run a ( simulation of ) a quantum system @xmath7 using randomness @xmath0 , approximately @xmath9 bits of @xmath0 can be reused . applying a function @xmath1 which has been shown to fulfill but not   could result in an output @xmath3 which is still correlated to the system @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , since it is known that the smooth conditional min - entropy precisely characterizes the optimal amount of uniform randomness that can be extracted from @xmath0 while being independent from @xmath7  @xcite , one may argue that is indeed the correct definition for randomness extraction .    in particular",
    ", we would like to point out that the popular bounded storage model  in which the entropy of the source @xmath9 is lower - bounded by @xmath11 and @xmath12 denotes the number of qubits needed to store @xmath7  is strictly weaker : there are sources @xmath0 and nontrivial side information @xmath7 such that @xmath13 , and extractors which are sound for any input with @xmath14 , but can not be applied to all sources with @xmath15 .",
    "an extractor which has only been proven sound in the bounded storage model can thus only extract @xmath11 bits of uniform randomness instead of the optimal @xmath16 bits . for the same reason in the purely classical case ,",
    "no recent work defines classical extractors for randomness sources with side information stored in bounded classical memories .",
    "furthermore , in applications where extractors are used , the increased generality of the conditional min - entropy over the bounded storage model is often what is needed .",
    "for example in quantum key distribution , where extractors are used for privacy amplification  @xcite , it is generally impossible to bound the adversary s memory size .",

    "is two - universal hashing  @xcite as well as constructions based on the sample - and - hash approach  @xcite .",
    "recently , ta - shma  @xcite studied trevisan s extractor construction  @xcite in the bounded quantum storage model .",
    "although his proof requires the output length to be much smaller than the min - entropy of the original data , the result was a breakthrough because it , for the first time , implied the existence of `` quantum - proof '' extractors requiring only short seeds ( logarithmic in the input length ) .",
    "more recently , two of the present authors  @xcite were able to improve the output length that trevisan s extractor could provably extract in the presence of a quantum bounded - storage adversary , bringing it close to what is known for the case of classical adversaries .",
    "however , both these results are proved in the bounded quantum storage model , which , as discussed previously , only allows the extractor to output at most @xmath17 bits .",
    "this expression can in general be arbitrarily smaller than @xmath9 , and in some cases may even become @xmath18 ( or negative ) for @xmath19-bit sources for which it is possible to extract @xmath20 bits of randomness .",
    "subsequent to this work , ben - aroya and ta - shma  @xcite showed how two versions of trevisan s extractor , shown quantum - proof in this paper , can be combined to extract a constant fraction of the min - entropy of an @xmath19-bit source with a seed of length @xmath21 , when @xmath22 .",
    "this is better than the straightforward application of trevisan s extractor analyzed here , which requires @xmath23 bits of seed for the same output size ( but works for any @xmath9 ) .",

    "this is the first proof of security of an extractor with poly - logarithmic seed meeting in the presence of arbitrary quantum side information .    more generally , we prove security of a whole class of extractors",
    ". it has been observed , by , e.g. , lu and vadhan  @xcite , that trevisan s extractor  @xcite ( and variations of it , such as @xcite ) is a concatenation of the outputs of a one - bit extractor with different pseudo - random seeds . since the proof of the extractor property is independent of the type of the underlying one - bit extractor ( and to some extent the construction of the pseudo - random seeds ) , our result is valid for a generic scheme ( defined in , ) .",
    "we find that the performance of this generic scheme in the context of quantum side information is roughly equivalent to the ( known ) case of purely classical side information ( , ) .",
    "our argument follows in spirit the work of de and vidick  @xcite . technically , the proof is essentially a concatenation of the two following ideas .",
    "* in the first part of the original proof of trevisan  @xcite , it is shown that the ability to distinguish the extractor s output from uniform implies the ability to distinguish the output of the underlying one - bit extractor from uniform ( a list - decodable code in trevisan s original scheme ) .",
    "ta - shma has argued that this claim is still true in the context of quantum side information  @xcite , by treating the adversary as an oracle and measuring its memory size by counting the queries to the oracle .",
    "we extend this result to the case of arbitrary quantum side information , where the entropy of the source is measured with the conditional min - entropy , and show that it still holds even if the seed of the underlying one - bit extractor is not fully uniform . *",
    "this reduces the problem to proving that the one - bit extractor used in the construction is quantum - proof .",
    "however , because for one - bit extractors , the more general is essentially equivalent to the usual , as shown by knig and terhal  @xcite , the claim follows from known classical results on one - bit extractors with only a small loss in the error parameter .",
    "this proof structure results in a very modular extractor construction paradigm , which allows arbitrary one - bit extractors and pseudo - random seeds to be `` plugged in , '' producing different final constructions , optimized for different needs , e.g. , maximizing the output length , minimizing the seed , or even using a non - uniform seed if the underlying one - bit extractor also uses a non - uniform seed . in",

    "<S> randomness extraction involves the processing of purely classical information and is therefore usually studied in the framework of classical probability theory . </S>",
    "<S> however , such a classical treatment is generally too restrictive for applications , where side information about the values taken by classical random variables may be represented by the state of a quantum system . </S>",
    "<S> this is particularly relevant in the context of cryptography , where an adversary may make use of quantum devices . here </S>",
    "<S> , we show that the well known construction paradigm for extractors proposed by trevisan is sound in the presence of quantum side information .    </S>",
    "<S> we exploit the modularity of this paradigm to give several concrete extractor constructions , which , e.g , extract all the conditional ( smooth ) min - entropy of the source using a seed of length poly - logarithmic in the input , or only require the seed to be weakly random . </S>"
