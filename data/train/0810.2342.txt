    "in many superconductors of current interest the electronic structure has strongly anisotropic character and the materials can be regarded as nearly two dimensional .",
    "examples include the cuprate high temperature superconductors,@xcite the organic superconductors,@xcite and the recently discovered iron - based oxy - pnictides.@xcite this reduced dimensionality gives rise to much interesting physics , such as enhanced fluctuation effects,@xcite and may even be essential to the elevated transition temperatures in two dimensional materials.@xcite however , strong electrical anisotropy leads to difficulties in the interpretation of electrodynamic experiments , particularly at rf and microwave frequencies where , in certain important geometries , the requirement to form closed current loops creates admixtures of in - plane and out - of - plane responses .",
    "finite size effects , which occur when characteristic electromagnetic length scales , such as penetration depth @xmath3 and skin depth @xmath4 , become comparable to sample size , present an additional level of complexity in electrically anisostropic materials , and are often relevant in layered superconductors .",
    "for instance , while the in - plane penetration depth @xmath1 in the yba@xmath5cu@xmath6o@xmath7  system is fairly short , ranging from @xmath8 m in optimally doped material@xcite to @xmath9 m in heavily underdoped material,@xcite the out - of - plane penetration depth @xmath0 ranges from @xmath10 m to @xmath11 m across the same range,@xcite becoming comparable to typical crystal sizes .",
    "bi@xmath5sr@xmath5cacu@xmath5o@xmath12  is even more electrically anisotropic , with @xmath13 m at optimal doping.@xcite moreover , these are low temperature values  penetration depths grow on approach to the superconducting transition , crossing over to the much larger normal - state skin depth above @xmath14 .",
    "the study of finite - size effects in isotropic superconductors dates from the first measurements of magnetic penetration depth , and solutions have been given for a wide range of geometries.@xcite finite - size effects in anisotropic superconductors have been considered more recently , with various approaches taken , depending on the geometry of the experiment . in all cases , a component of the external magnetic field is applied _ parallel _ to the highly conducting layers , inducing screening current loops with some component flowing _ perpendicular _ to the layers , along the crystalline @xmath15  axis . in the simplest geometries ,",
    "the magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the @xmath15  axis , and the sample is assumed to be long in the field direction , eliminating demagnetization effects . as we will see below , this results in a two - dimensional screening equation that is quite tractable and is solved to obtain the internal magnetic field distribution .",
    "gough and exon,@xcite and independently mansky and co - workers,@xcite have considered such a case for an electrically anisotropic superconductor with rectangular cross - section .",
    "their models provide realistic representations of experiments on platelet crystals , which are usually thin in the @xmath15 direction .",
    "porch and waldram , working on grain aligned powders , were the first to discuss the effective penetration depth of an electrically anisotropic sphere.@xcite in the limit that @xmath0 is large compared to both @xmath1 and the radius of the sphere , @xmath16 , screening currents are weak and demagnetization effects are negligible .",
    "current loops , by symmetry , are then circular , and they showed that the internal field profile could be related to that of a sphere with isotropic electrodynamics and equivalent isotropic penetration depth @xmath17 . this particular result has found much use in the analysis of experiments on grain - aligned powders,@xcite and is simple to apply because it does not depend on @xmath1 . in the opposite limit , @xmath18 , porch and waldram argued that the current loops would again be approximately circular , and that the problem could be mapped onto an isotropic sphere with @xmath19 .    here",
    "we present the first complete solution to this problem , solving both cylindrical and spherical models for values of @xmath0 ranging from zero to much greater than @xmath16 .",
    "we confirm that the limits discussed by waldram and porch are correct in the case of a long cylinder .",
    "however , we now obtain exact results for the sphere and show that there are significant departures from the cylindrical case , particularly in the limit @xmath20 . the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ electrodynamics ] we derive the electromagnetic screening equations for an anisotropic superconductor , for both 2d and 3d geometries , and then show how dissipation at finite frequencies can be incorporated into the electrodynamics using analytic continuation . in sec .",
    "[ cylinder ] we consider the problem of a long cylinder with anisotropic electrodynamics .",
    "this is useful both as a lead - in to the more difficult problem of the anisotropic sphere , and for demonstrating how experimentally accessible quantities such as surface impedance and penetration depth can be obtained from the internal field distribution of the superconductor . in sec .",
    "[ sphere ] we set up and solve the problem of a spherical sample in which @xmath21 .",
    "this is followed by a summary of our results in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "unconventional superconductors such as the cuprates and organics are usually well described by london electrodynamics , as in most instances penetration depth is long compared to coherence length , causing the fields to vary slowly over the scale of a cooper pair . in the london gauge , @xmath22 and the supercurrent density @xmath23",
    "is directly related to the vector potential @xmath24 by @xmath25 .",
    "here @xmath26 is the london parameter . in general @xmath26",
    "is a tensor quantity and is what characterizes the anisotropic electrodynamic response of layered superconductors .",
    "the screening equation that describes the meissner state follows from combining london electrodynamics with maxwell s equations : @xmath27 in the isotropic case the london parameter is a scalar , @xmath28 , leading to the usual screening equation for magnetic field , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the london penetration depth . in the case of anisotropic electrodynamics , and working in cartesian coordinates , the inverse london parameter is the diagonal tensor @xmath31 inserting this into eq .  [ curlequation ]",
    "we obtain the general form for the anisotropic screening equation , @xmath32 where , for instance , @xmath33 denotes the partial derivative @xmath34 , and so on . in what follows we will focus on layered superconductors with uniaxial symmetry , in which case @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "a slight modification of the approach outlined above allows dissipative electrodynamics at finite frequencies to be treated within the same framework as the static screening response in the meissner state . at finite frequency , the static electromagnetic fields are replaced by harmonically varying , quasistatic fields , represented by phasor notation .",
    "for example , @xmath37 in this case , penetration depth @xmath3 is replaced by a complex skin depth @xmath38 that is determined by the complex conductivity , @xmath39 in terms of @xmath38 , the surface impedance is @xmath40 . in the low frequency limit , where dissipation is negligible ,",
    "the london results are regained , with @xmath41 in the normal state , where @xmath42 , @xmath38 can be directly related to the dc resistivity , @xmath43 : @xmath44 results will be derived in the following sections in terms of the purely static superconductive parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 but , in all cases , these can be generalized by analytic continuation using the substitution @xmath45 .",
    "the results for the electrically anisotropic cylinder and sphere can therefore be applied to a much wider range of measurements and scenarios than layered superconductors in the low frequency limit , including high frequency measurements on metals . in the case of the cylinder ,",
    "the results can even be applied to magnetic materials with the substitution @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the ( complex ) relative permittivity .",
    "this extension to the magnetic case does not apply to the sphere , however , as the boundary matching procedure used in the solution implicitly assumes that the magnetic permeability of the sample is equal to that of vacuum .",
    "nevertheless , the method used to solve the spherical case could readily be extended to handle magnetic materials by adapting the boundary matching procedure .",
    "insight into the problem of the electrically anisotropic sphere can be obtained from solving the much simpler problem of an infinitely long anisotropic cylinder . in this case",
    "there are no demagnetizing fields , so the surface field is equal to the applied field @xmath48 .",
    "also , symmetry dictates that only the axial component of the magnetic field is nonzero .",
    "the geometry of the long rectangular platelet , dealt with by gough and exon,@xcite also has these properties .",
    "we define the axis of the cylinder to lie along the @xmath49-direction , and the crystal @xmath15-axis to point in the @xmath50 direction .",
    "we place the origin of the coordinate system on the cylinder axis .",
    "the cylinder has radius @xmath16 and the location of its surface is given by @xmath51 . with this choice of coordinates ,",
    "the superconducting layers lie parallel to the @xmath52-plane . in this geometry ,",
    "the screening equation , eq .  [ eqnfullscreen ] , reduces to @xmath53 we are interested in the limit of extreme anisotropy , @xmath21 , in which to good approximation we can set @xmath1 to zero . in that limit the screening equation",
    "becomes one - dimensional : @xmath54    [ t ]     +    this limit is particularly easy to solve  magnetic flux penetrates the sample in planes parallel to the superconducting layers , and is prevented from passing through the layers by their perfect conductivity .",
    "we can then slice the cylinder up into a set of independent plates , parallel to the superconducting layers , and solve the screening equation separately in each one .",
    "for each plate , the process is identical to the problem of the infinite slab of thickness @xmath55 , the solution of which has been tabulated by shoenberg.@xcite we substitute into the slab solution , with a slab thickness that is function of position , @xmath56 , to obtain the magnetic field in the interior of the cylinder , @xmath57 contours of contstant @xmath58 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for different values of @xmath59 .",
    "despite the extreme anisotropy of the electrodynamics , the magnetic field distribution becomes isotropic in the limits @xmath60 and @xmath61 , with the effect that screening currents will form circular loops in these two situations .",
    "one rigorous way to calculate an effective penetration depth , @xmath62 , is to use the power - flow method of gough and exon , at finite frequency , to calculate the effective surface impedance , @xmath63 , corresponding to reactive power flow into the sample.@xcite for an applied field @xmath64 , faraday s law gives the average electric field : @xmath65 the power flowing into the cylinder per unit length is @xmath66 the surface impedance is related to the power per unit area @xmath67 , implying @xmath68 we see that the effective penetration depth is related to the total magnetic flux inside the sample , @xmath69 , which can be partially evaluated in from the solution for @xmath58 : @xmath70 the effective penetration depth is then @xmath71 this is just the average of the infinite slab expression for effective penetration depth , @xmath72,@xcite over one quadrant , normalized to the length of arc @xmath73 . in the limit , @xmath74 .",
    "we can understand this in the following way .",
    "screening currents in this limit are set by the total magnetic field and are confined to flow parallel to the surface .",
    "we can therefore define an angle dependent surface impedance , where @xmath75 measures the angle from the @xmath76 axis , with the superfluid response represented by an angle - dependent complex resistivity , @xmath77 in the limit of extreme anisotropy we set @xmath78 , then .",
    "the effective penetration depth is the angle average of @xmath79 : @xmath80    in the opposite limit , @xmath81 , the effective penetration depth @xmath82 . to extract information on @xmath0 in this limit",
    "it is useful to make a connection with results for the _ isotropic _ cylinder .",
    "the solution in the isotropic case has also been presented by shoenberg,@xcite with the result that the internal field distribution is given by @xmath83 and the effective penetration depth is given by @xmath84 here @xmath85 and @xmath86 are bessel functions of order zero and one respectively . since the internal field distribution of the electrically anisotropic cylinder becomes isotropic in the limit @xmath81 , we can make the following argument : for a given value of @xmath0 in the anisotropic cylinder , there is an equivalent penetration depth @xmath87 for the _ isotropic _ cylinder that results in the same internal field distribution , and therefore the same @xmath62 .",
    "the necessary mapping can be identified from series expansions of the internal fields . for the anisotropic cylinder , @xmath88 where @xmath89 . for the isotropic cylinder ,",
    "@xmath90 where we have used @xmath91 one expansion can be mapped on to the other with the choice . to see this another way",
    ", we note that in this limit it is not the surface impedance that is angle - averaged , but the electric field . since the current loops are circular , the average electric field @xmath92 is proportional to @xmath93    the idea of an equivalent penetration depth can be used across the full parameter range , even when the current loops are no longer circular .",
    "we have shown above that as @xmath60 , @xmath94 , which is not much different from the finite size limit @xmath95 . in between these limits",
    ", we can obtain the equivalent penetration depth by equating the isotropic and anisotropic expressions for the effective penetration depth @xmath62 : @xmath96 this has been solved numerically , and the scale factor @xmath97 plotted in fig .  [ lambdaequiv ] as a function of @xmath59 .",
    "the general case of the electrically anisotropic sphere is described by the full screening equation , eq .",
    "[ eqnfullscreen ] . to solve it",
    ", we will carry out multi - pole expansions of the interior and exterior magnetic fields and match them at the surface of the sphere .",
    "the key to making this process tractable is to use the somewhat unusual choice of coordinate system shown in fig .",
    "[ anisosphere ] , in which external field is applied along the @xmath49 direction and the crystal @xmath15 axis points is the @xmath50 direction , with cylindrical coordinates used inside the sphere and spherical coordinates outside .",
    "the motivation behind this choice is that the azimuthal angle @xmath98 will then be the same inside and out .",
    "when we specialize to the limit @xmath99 , the screening equation , eq .",
    "[ eqnfullscreen ] , becomes @xmath100 the infinitely strong screening response implied by means that magnetic flux can not cross the superconducting layers and @xmath101 inside the sphere .",
    "combined with @xmath102 , we have @xmath103 . the screening equation is then @xmath104 which we will rewrite in cylindrical coordinates . inside the sphere",
    "the screening equation for the magnetic field decouples into separate circular slices .",
    "we use a cylindrical coordinate system @xmath105 in which the cylinder axis lies along the @xmath50 direction .",
    "the azimuthal angle @xmath98 is measured from the @xmath49-axis .",
    "the screening equation is @xmath106 , with @xmath101 .",
    "is applied along the @xmath49 axis , in the plane of the superconducting layers .",
    "spherical coordinates @xmath107 are used outside the sphere , and cylindrical coordinates @xmath105 inside .",
    "this choice of geometry greatly simplifies the matching of field components at the boundary , because the azimuthal angle @xmath98 is the same inside and out.,width=60 ]    expanding this out , we have @xmath108 where @xmath109 and similarly for @xmath110 . again using @xmath111 and @xmath101 ,",
    "the azimuthal component of @xmath112 can be obtained from the radial component : @xmath113 the screening equation for the radial component then reduces to @xmath114 separating variables we have @xmath115 and @xmath116 the azimuthal component has solutions of the form @xmath117 , where @xmath118 and @xmath119 are constants and the @xmath120 are positive integers .",
    "the radial equation is @xmath121 keeping only solutions that are regular at and even about the origin , the general form for the radial solution is@xcite @xmath122 where the @xmath123 are constants and the @xmath124 are modified ( or _ hyperbolic _ ) bessel functions of the first kind , of order @xmath120 . including the azimuthal dependence , the most general form for the radial component of the interior field is @xmath125 the @xmath126 terms are ruled out by the symmetry @xmath127 . also , as we will discuss below , only the @xmath128 component is required to match to the exterior fields . in this case",
    "the interior field simplifies to @xmath129 where the expression has been normalized so that at the surface of each slice it takes the value . by labeling the @xmath50",
    "coordinate of each slice by the polar angle of its edge , we are anticipating that the exterior field will be expanded in spherical coordinates .",
    "as shown above , the azimuthal component of the interior field can be obtained from radial component by differentiation to give @xmath130    for the exterior field we use spherical coordinates @xmath107 , where the polar axis lies along the @xmath50 direction as shown in fig .",
    "[ anisosphere ] .",
    "the exterior field is a solution of @xmath131 . in the space outside the sphere",
    "there is no current , so we can obtain the magnetic field from a scalar potential , @xmath132 . for a field @xmath133",
    "applied along the @xmath49 direction , the most general form for @xmath134 is @xmath135 where the @xmath136 are the associated legendre polynomials .",
    "the symmetry of the problem greatly restricts the number of terms in the expansion .",
    "the symmetries of the radial component of magnetic field , @xmath137 , are @xmath138 in addition , only the @xmath139 term is contained in the applied field , and there is nothing in the problem to couple channels of different @xmath140 .",
    "for this reason we can restrict the expansion to @xmath139 .",
    "the magnetic scalar potential is then @xmath141 from the gradient of @xmath134 we obtain the three components of the exterior magnetic field : @xmath142 the next step is to match the fields at the surface of the sphere , @xmath143 .",
    "the azimuthal components of the interior and exterior fields both have a @xmath144 angle dependence and are straightforward to match : @xmath145 matching of the radial and polar components of the magnetic field is more complicated . inside the sphere , the infinite conductivity we have assumed for the cuo@xmath5 layers confines the magnetic field to lie in planes parallel to the @xmath52-plane , so that @xmath146 .",
    "however , if we also assume that just outside the sphere , we run into a contradiction . substituting the expansions of @xmath147 and @xmath148 we obtain @xmath149 which has only the trivial solution @xmath150 , indicating that @xmath151 only in the fully penetrated limit .",
    "this shows that for finite @xmath0 there is an abrupt change in the direction of @xmath112 on crossing the surface ( see plots on the right - hand side of fig .",
    "[ fieldpenetration ] ) , implying the presence of surface currents .",
    "this is consistent with the assumption of an infinite conductivity within the cuo@xmath5 layers : by current continuity , there will in general be in - plane components of the screening current that flow at the surface .",
    "these surface currents must have no component along the @xmath50 axis ( the crystal ) and therefore flow only in _ azimuthal _ trajectories . as such",
    ", they do not act as sources for @xmath152 , showing that the azimuthal component of the field indeed remains decoupled from @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "the matching condition for @xmath147 and @xmath148 is the conservation of magnetic flux .",
    "this is equivalent to matching field components normal to the surface , requiring @xmath153 .",
    "the polar components @xmath154 and @xmath155 do not cross the surface , so do not affect flux conservation .",
    "their difference gives the surface current density , @xmath156 .",

    "however , as pointed out above , higher order harmonics are excited to linear order in @xmath59 .",
    "this difference was also anticipated in the approximate treatment by waldram and co - workers,@xcite who pointed out that the local impedance tensor on the surface of the sphere is a complicated function of angle , with principal axes that do not in general correspond with lines of latitude and longitude .",
