    "the ( h@xmath0)@xmath0 dimer has long been viewed as a prototypical bimolecular van der waals dimer . because the ( h@xmath0)@xmath0 dimer is electronically simple , it has been the focus of a number of ab initio studies ; however , because the h@xmath0h@xmath0 van der waals interaction is quite weak,@xcite ab initio calculations with accuracy much higher than the oft - quoted `` chemical accuracy '' of 1  kcal / mol must be employed to provide useful information about the h@xmath0h@xmath0 potential energy surface .",
    "two recent advances in ab initio methods have made it possible to compute the h@xmath0h@xmath0 interaction with the required level of accuracy : ( 1 ) the development of hierarchical sequences of one - electron gaussian basis sets for approximating molecular electronic wave functions,@xcite sequences which systematically approach the complete one - electron basis set limit , and ( 2 ) the development of efficient methods for accounting for electron correlation effects in these wave functions by systematically approaching the many - electron basis set limit.@xcite    diep and johnson@xcite took advantage of these two advances in ab initio methods to compute an accurate four - dimensional rigid rotor potential energy surface for the ( h@xmath0)@xmath0 dimer ; the diep  johnson surface",
    "gives low temperature second virial coefficients and integral elastic scattering cross sections in reasonably good agreement with experiment .",
    "however , this potential energy surface does not depend explicitly on the covalent bond lengths of the two h@xmath0 monomers , and thus is only able to describe the interaction between two h@xmath0 molecules in their @xmath3 vibrational ground states .",
    "more recently , boothroyd _",
    "et al._@xcite have compiled a large database of energies for the h@xmath4 system , based largely on multireference configuration interaction ab initio calculations , and have fit a global six - dimensional h@xmath4 potential energy surface to these energies . however , in this database , ( h@xmath0)@xmath0 dimer configurations representative of the van der waals well are assigned energies that come not from ab initio calculations , but rather from a empirically modified rigid rotor potential energy surface .",
    "recent theoretical studies of low - energy inelastic h@xmath0h@xmath0 collisions that use this potential energy surface@xcite yield computed energy transfer rate coefficients in rather poor agreement with experiment .    the ( h@xmath0)@xmath0 dimer has also been the focus of several experimental investigations , beginning with the pioneering work of watanabe and welsh@xcite that demonstrated the dimer s existence through observation of its infrared ( ir ) absorption spectrum in the h@xmath0 @xmath5 vibrational fundamental band . later experimental studies@xcite recorded at high resolution the ir absorption spectra of the ( h@xmath0)@xmath0 dimer ( and several of its isotopomers ) in the @xmath6 fundamental band and @xmath7 first overtone band of the corresponding monomers .",
    "the high resolution ir absorption spectra of ( h@xmath0)@xmath0 in the h@xmath0 fundamental and overtone regions , and the analogous isotopomer spectra , provide information about the vibrational dependence of the h@xmath0h@xmath0 interaction .",
    "complementary studies@xcite of the far - ir absorption spectrum of the dimer provide information about the anisotropy of the potential energy surface in the region of the van der waals well .",
    "recently , the raman spectrum of the ( h@xmath0)@xmath0 dimer in the h@xmath0 fundamental region has also been observed.@xcite this spectrum provides information about the vibrational dependence of the h@xmath0h@xmath0 interaction that is complementary to that provided by the high - resolution ir studies .",
    "specifically , the vibrationally excited state of ( h@xmath0)@xmath0 that is probed by the ir studies is one in which the vibrational excitation is delocalized across the two h@xmath0 monomers in an antisymmetric fashion , while in the raman studies , the excited ( h@xmath0)@xmath0 state is one in which the vibrational excitation is delocalized symmetrically across the two monomers .",
    "a comparison of the ir and raman spectra thus provides insight into the coupling between the two h@xmath0 vibrational modes in the ( h@xmath0)@xmath0 complex and into the dependence of the h@xmath0h@xmath0 potential energy surface on the two monomers bond lengths .",
    "equipped with this new information , we attempt here the construction of a six - dimensional h@xmath0h@xmath0 potential energy surface that accurately describes the dimer s van der waals well .",
    "we begin by computing ab initio h@xmath0h@xmath0 interaction energies that are nearly converged with respect to both the one - electron and many - electron basis sets , and then construct a smooth potential energy surface from these computed interaction energies .",
    "we then make two small empirical adjustments to the surface ; these adjustments soften slightly the surface s short - range repulsive wall , and increase slightly the strength of the surface s anisotropic term that couples the rotational degrees of freedom of the two monomers .",
    "the empirically adjusted surface gives ir and raman transition energies for the ( _ para_-h@xmath0)@xmath0 , ( _ ortho_-d@xmath0)@xmath0 , and _ para_-h@xmath0_ortho_-d@xmath0 dimers in good agreement with available experimental data.@xcite",

    "earlier studies of the four - dimensional rigid - rotor h@xmath0h@xmath0 potential energy surface@xcite show that the surface is dominated by four terms , with @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 . in this work ,",

    "symmetry relationships allow the rest of the @xmath41 interaction energies at fixed @xmath42 to be determined from these ab initio calculations .",
    "the accuracy of the @xmath43 coefficients computed in this fashion is limited by the fact that the quadrature rule we use fails to reproduce the orthogonality conditions @xmath44 when @xmath45 or @xmath46 .",

    "we turn off automatic checking of the one - electron overlap matrix for near linear dependence and retain all 206 one - electron basis functions at every configuration ; this eliminates possible discontinuities in the potential energy surface that could arise when some of these functions are dropped from the one - electron basis set .",

    "similar effects have been observed in other weakly - bound dimers of two - valence - electron systems.@xcite to reduce the error associated with truncation of the many - electron basis set at the ccsd(t ) level of theory , we employ a coupled - cluster treatment that includes a fully iterative treatment of single , double , and triple excitations,@xcite abbreviated ccsdt , to compute the h@xmath0h@xmath0 interaction energy at selected high - symmetry geometries ( those in which @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 take values of 0 or @xmath67 ) .",

    "we therefore perform the ccsdt calculations using a smaller one - electron basis set consisting of only atom - centered aug - cc - pvtz functions .",
    "we also use nwchem to perform ccsd(t ) calculations at these high - symmetry geometries using the atom - centered aug - cc - pvtz basis set .",

    "because we compute the full - triples correction at a small number of h@xmath0h@xmath0 orientations @xmath25 , we can not use the quadrature scheme described in the the previous subsection to extract corresponding full - triples corrections to the @xmath43 coefficients computed at the ccsd(t ) aug - cc - pvqz + ( 3s3p2d ) level of theory . instead",

    "we have presented a six - dimensional h@xmath0h@xmath0 potential energy surface that accurately describes several bound ( and long - lived quasibound ) states of the ( h@xmath0)@xmath0 , ( d@xmath0)@xmath0 , and h@xmath0d@xmath0 dimers that correlate with h@xmath0 and d@xmath0 monomers in their @xmath1 , @xmath237 , @xmath220 , and @xmath238 rovibrational states . the surface is based on a set of ab initio h@xmath0h@xmath0 interaction energies that appear to be nearly converged with respect to the one - electron and many - electron basis sets , and which cover fairly densely the region of configuration space associated with the dimer s van der waals well .",
    "the surface incorporates two empirical adjustments : one softens slightly the surface s repulsive wall at small h@xmath0h@xmath0 distances , and one increases slightly the magnitude of the surface s @xmath50 term that couples the rotational degrees of freedom of the two monomers .",
    "the latter adjustment appears to compensate for the fact that our original @xmath50 coefficients include small contributions from the electrostatic quadrupole ",
    "hexadecapole interaction between the two molecules .",
    "a fortran subroutine that evaluates the @xmath214 potential energy surface is available through epaps.@xcite    an empirical softening of the ab initio h@xmath0h@xmath0 interaction energy at small intermolecular distances is not unprecedented . for instance , schaefer and kohler@xcite found that by softening the short - range repulsive wall of an ab initio h@xmath0h@xmath0 potential energy surface , they could bring properties computed using the surface ( in this case , the second virial coefficient of h@xmath0 gas ) into better agreement with experiment .",
    "the surface of diep and johnson@xcite is based on a series of ab initio calculations that have been extrapolated to the estimated complete one - electron basis set limit ; this extrapolation technique yields a surface whose repulsive wall is slightly softer than that of the largest basis - set surface explicitly calculated , and thus has the same effect as an empirical softening of the repulsive wall .",
    "it would be interesting to compute the h@xmath0h@xmath0 interaction energy using explicitly - correlated electronic structure methods@xcite to see whether lingering basis set incompleteness in the present ab initio calculations is what necessitates the softening of the short - range repulsive wall of the surface .",
    "we have used our potential energy surface to predict the energies of 34 not - yet - observed ir and raman transitions for ( h@xmath0)@xmath0 , ( d@xmath0)@xmath0 , and h@xmath0d@xmath0 dimers involving even-@xmath127 states of the h@xmath0 and d@xmath0 monomers . observations of these transitions could help verify the accuracy of the present potential energy surface , or point out areas where the surface could be further improved .",
    "calculations of the energy levels of dimers containing one @xmath239 molecule , such as _ ortho_-h@xmath0_para_-h@xmath0 , could also be useful in this regard ; these calculations are in progress and will be reported in due course .",
