    "however so far for only some 40 globular clusters absolute proper motions exist ( dinescu et al .",

    "( 1999 and references herein ) .",
    "the results of the hipparcos mission offer new possibilities for the determination of absolute proper motions of globular clusters and other objects of interest for galactic kinematics . since previous studies have used mainly extragalactic objects as proper motion zero points , the use of hipparcos reference stars offers a unique possibility for the determination of absolute proper motions at low galactic latitutes without suitable extragalactic background objects .",
    "geffert et al .",

    "a complete discussion of these data together with additional proper motions was given recently in dinescu et al .",

    "m10 is a globular cluster located very near to the direction to the galactic center ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) , but at a distance of only 4.3  kpc from the sun . due to its metallicity of @xmath4 = -1.52\\;$]dex ( harris 1996 ) it belongs to the halo group of clusters according to zinn s ( 1985 ) classification . the preliminary kinematical data of m10 ( geffert et al .",
    "1997 ) indicate a disk like motion , the most disk like motion found in the group of globular clusters , whose proper motions were determined using hipparcos ( odenkirchen et al .",
    "1997 ) . however , this preliminary proper motion has the problem that only three to four hipparcos stars could be used for the reduction of the plates .",
    "this made the previous solution very uncertain .",
    "here we have included new photographic material ( from shanghai ) and recent ccd observations to get a new determination of the absolute proper motion of m10 .",

    ". however , as mentioned in odenkirchen et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , the result of m10 was only preliminary due to the small number of hipparcos stars used for the reduction of the plates .",
    "the use of additional plates from shanghai has led to a significant lower proper motion in declination .",
    "however , even for this sample of plates the solution is only moderately stable : omitting one reference star leads to an absolute proper motion of m10 , which differs from the original solution by about more than the mean uncertainties of the absolute proper motions .",

    "the catalogues based on the act catalogue ( urban et al .",
    "1998 ) and on the hipparcos catalogue ( esa 1997 ) contributed therefore with equal weight to the final absolute proper motion of the globular cluster m10 .",

    "we show that the differences between the solutions based on the act catalogue and the corresponding one based on the hipparcos catalogue are small .",
    "although this result has to be checked using data of other fields , it would offer a range of applications for the act catalogue because of its larger number of stars .",
    "moreover , even reaching only moderate accuracy on the wide field ccd frames with respect to small field ccd observations , our results indicate that these observations may supersede the photographic plates in near future .",
    "the new data of m10 show an eccentricity of the orbit of 0.41 , which would place the cluster now in the range of eccentricities from 0.4 to 0.8 found for the majority of the globular clusters ( odenkirchen et al .",

    "according to its moderate eccentricity and rotational velocity , m10 belongs rather to the halo class of objects .",
    "this is in line with its metallicity .",
    "however , the @xmath0-distance from the galactic plane does not exceed 3  kpc , which would be more characteristic for a thick disk object .    as noted already in dinescu et al .",

    "this result would imply that at the time when the oldest globular clusters were born , the milky way had already a gas distribution with a disk component , where the gas enabled the formation of clusters . on the other hand the recent age determination by rosenberg et al .",

    "if the luminosity function would be affected by the crossing of the cluster through the galactic plane , one would rather expect a more flat luminosity function for m10 due to the evaporation of faint stars as it was found recently for the globular cluster ngc  6712 ( de marchi et al .",
