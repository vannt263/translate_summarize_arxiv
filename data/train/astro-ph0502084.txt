    "after the observation of grb  990123 and its afterglow , it was realized that gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are collimated and not isotropic explosions .",
    "grb  990123 was a most problematic event since it called for more than a solar mass of energy entirely converted into @xmath1-ray photons ( kulkarni et al .",
    "1999 ) to explain its fluence under the assumption of isotropic emission .",
    "it also had a peculiar afterglow , with a steepening of the decay rate approximately one day after explosion ( castro - tirado et al .",
    "this behavior had been predicted to be the signature of a collimated outflow ( rhoads 1997 , 1999 ) . after correcting for beaming the implied energy release",
    "was reduced to @xmath2  erg ( bloom , frail & kulkarni 2003 ) , well below the energy crisis level of @xmath3  erg .",
    "grb jets were initially postulated to be uniform , i.e. , with constant properties ( energy flux , lorentz factor , pressure ) within a well - defined opening angle @xmath4 and nothing outside . such jets would produce a steepening afterglow light curve , with the break time scaling as @xmath5 ( sari , piran & halpern 1999 ) , where @xmath6 is the isotropic equivalent energy of the outflow and @xmath7 the density of the ambient medium .",
    "frail et al . ( 2001 ) and panaitescu & kumar ( 2001 ) discovered a remarkable anti - correlation between the jet break time and the isotropic equivalent energy release @xmath8 in the prompt phase .",
    "such a correlation , initially entirely empirical , can be accounted for if it is assumed that the same total energy is given to every grb but is channeled into jets with different opening angles .",
    "a narrow jet would appear as a very bright grb followed by an early - breaking afterglow , while a wide jet would produce a weak grb and an afterglow with a late break .",
    "rossi , lazzati & rees ( 2002 ) realized that the relation @xmath9constant may reflect a universal angular distribution of jet energy rather than a distribution of opening angles among different jets ( see also lipunov , postnov & prokhorov 2001 ; zhang & mszros  2002 ) .",
    "in this case one would write @xmath10 rossi et al . also showed that such an energy pattern would produce an afterglow that reproduces the frail et al .",
    "correlation and does not violate other observations .",
    "different observed properties would reflect different observing geometries rather than different intrinsic jet properties .",
    "several other jet morphologies have since been proposed and studied , specifically general power - law profiles and gaussian profiles ( granot & kumar 2003 ; salmonson 2003 , rossi et al .",
    "2004 ; zhang et al .",
    "despite this theoretical interest , research on structured jets has focused on their late - time dynamics ( kumar & granot 2003 ) and observable properties ( perna , sari & frail 2003 ; nakar , granot & guetta 2004 ) and not on the origin of the energy distribution .",
    "the only exception is the electromagnetic force - free model , in which a structured jet is predicted naturally ( lyutikov , pariev & blandford 2003 ) .",
    "some degree of structure in grb jets is implied by their connection to supernova ( sn ) explosions ( galama et al .",
    "1998 ; stanek et al .",
    "2003 ; hjorth et al . 2003 ; malesani et al .",
    "the shear forces and mixing of the cold stellar material with the outflowing relativistic plasma are expected to create an interface or hollow slower jet around the hyper - relativistic flow ( macfadyen & woosley 1999 ; macfadyen et al .",
    "2001 ; proga et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the resulting energy distributions of the highly relativistic material are , however , far from a power - law ( zhang , woosley & heger 2004b ) .",
    "if one includes the trans - relativistic outflow energy a power - law profile is obtained , but with the steep index @xmath11 .    in this letter",
    "we propose a mechanism to create structured jets with @xmath12 as a result of the time evolution of the opening angle of an hydrodynamic jet .",
    "this mechanism relies on the nature of the jet propagation through the star but is more robust and predictable than the poorly understood shear effects and mixing instabilities .",
    "we show that , under a simple ansatz ( constant luminosity engine ) this mechanism yields a beam pattern following the prescription of eq .",
    "[ eq : stru ] under wide conditions .",
    "this letter is organized as follows : in   2 we describe the star , cocoon and jet conditions at breakout ; in ",
    "3 we compute the jet evolution during the release of the cocoon material and the resulting jet structure at large radii .",
    "we discuss our results and their implications in   4 and",
    "we summarize our findings in   5 .",
    "consider a high entropy mildly relativistic jet ( @xmath13 ) generated at some small radius @xmath14  cm in the core of a massive star with an opening angle @xmath15 .",
    "the jet tries to accelerate under the pressure of internal forces .",
    "we assume that the initial jet has enough momentum to define a direction of propagation and avoid a spherical explosion of the star .",
    "such initial conditions are analogous to those adopted in numerical simulations ( zhang et al . 2003 , 2004b ) . in the absence of any external material",
    ", it would accelerate in a broad conical outflow , with its lorentz factor scaling with radius as @xmath16 .    if the jet is surrounded by dense cold matter , as in the collapsar / hypernova scenario ( woosley 1993 ; macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) , such acceleration is inhibited .",
    "once the jet reaches supersonic speeds with respect to the stellar material , the ram pressure of the shocked gas ahead of the jet drives a reverse shock into the head of the jet , slowing the jet head down to subrelativistic speeds .",
    "the mixture of shocked jet and shocked stellar material surrounds the advancing jet to form a high pressure cocoon , analogous to the cocoon formed by a low - density jet from a radio galaxy advancing into the intergalactic medium ( scheuer 1974 ) . as a result",
    "the jet dynamics is governed by three competing effects .",
    "first , the internal pressure accelerates the jet material , whose lorentz factor scales as @xmath17 if the acceleration is isentropic , where @xmath18 is the jet cross section of a single jet and @xmath19 its value at @xmath20 ( see , e.g. , beloborodov 2003 ,   3.1 ) . if the jet suffers internal dissipation as it propagates , e.g. , from entrainment of cocoon material or internal shocks , then the increase of @xmath21 with @xmath18 is slower",
    "this can be caused , e.g. , by shear instabilities at the jet - cocoon boundary .",
    "second , the head of the jet is slowed down by its interaction with the massive star",
    ". the larger the jet cross - section , the slower its head propagates . both shocked jet and stellar material flow to the sides feeding the cocoon .",
    "third , the cocoon pressure acts as a collimating force on the jet , which therefore becomes narrower and more penetrating , albeit less relativistic .",
    "matzner ( 2003 ) developed a simple analytic treatment to follow this propagation . using the kompaneets approximation ( kompaneets 1960 ) to describe the cocoon expansion",
    ", he was able to compute the jet propagation time within the star and the cocoon properties at the moment the jet head reaches the stellar surface  the breakout time , @xmath22 . for our purposes we need merely to compare the width of the cocoon at breakout with the width of the jet .",
    "consider a jet with luminosity @xmath23 that reaches the stellar surface at @xmath24 .",
    "the energy stored in the cocoon ( neglecting adiabatic losses ) is @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the radius of the star .",
    "about half of the cocoon energy is transferred to the nonrelativistic shocked stellar plasma via the cocoon shock , with the other half remaining in relativistic , shocked jet material .",
    "if we adopt a relativistic equation of state for the entire cocoon , we can write the cocoon pressure as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the volume and @xmath29 the transverse radius of the cocoon ( we assume that the jet occupies a negligible fraction of the cocoon volume . ) the velocity of the shock @xmath30 driven by the cocoon pressure into the star can be computed by balancing the cocoon pressure against the ram pressure exerted by the stellar material ( which has negligible internal pressure ) : @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the matter density of the star .",
    "this set of relations can be used with eq .",
    "[ eq : pc ] to obtain an equation for the cocoon pressure that reads ( see also begelman and cioffi 1986 for a similar treatment in the context of extragalactic radio sources ) : @xmath33^{1/2 } \\simeq\\left(\\frac{l_j\\,\\rho_\\star}{3\\,r_\\star\\,t_{\\rm{br}}}\\right)^{1/2 } .",
    "\\label{eq : pc2}\\ ] ] we assume that the head of the jet propagates subrelativistically through the star and write @xmath34 , where @xmath35 . then , adopting the notation @xmath36 and using cgs units throughout , we have @xmath37 the opening angle of the cocoon is given by @xmath38 i.e. , of the order of tens of degrees .",
    "now let us consider the properties of the jet as it reaches the breakout radius . the jet pressure is given by @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the lorentz factor of the jet material before it is shocked at the jet head .",
    "setting @xmath41 ( begelman & cioffi 1989 ; kaiser & alexnder 1997 ) with @xmath42 , we find @xmath43 for isentropic flow between @xmath20 and @xmath26 the confined jet reaches a lorentz factor @xmath44 with somewhat lower values if the jet is dissipative . the corresponding jet opening angle at breakout is @xmath45 ; however , the fact that @xmath46 suggests that the jet should freely expand to a few times @xmath47 after exiting the star .",
    "even so , the jet at breakout is expected to be more than an order of magnitude narrower than the cocoon .",
    "a more detailed treatment of the evolution of the cocoon and its interaction with the jet can be obtained by numerical integration of the set of differential equations that govern the flow .",
    "this allows us to take into account the density gradient of the star and the shape of the cocoon .",
    "results ( lazzati et al . 2005 ) do not differ substantially from these analytic estimates .",
    "these results may be altered if substantial dissipation due to recollimation shocks and/or shear instabilities takes place .",
    "we do not attempt to model these effects here .",
    "recollimation shocks are however relatively weak , being mostly oblique to the flow . as a matter of fact , these results are in qualitative agreement with results from numerical simulations ( zhang , woosley & macfadyen 2003 ) .",
    "simulations show , indeed , that isentropic conditions are not respected throughout the propagation , since collimation shocks take place .",
    "these shocks effectively create a new nozzle at a larger radius @xmath48 which modifies the scaling of the lorentz factor with the jet cross section .",
    "what is of relevance here is that no matter how wide the jet is initially ( and it is likely to be poorly collimated , especially if initial collimation is provided by the accretion disk ) , the jet that emerges from the star is narrow and highly collimated by the cocoon pressure .",
    "this result is observed in all numerical simulations of jets in collapsars ( macfadyen & woosley 1999 ; macfadyen , woosley & heger 2001 ; zhang et al .",
    "the cocoon , on the other hand , covers a wide solid angle , several tens of degrees across . in the next section ,",
    "we explore what happens after jet breakout .",
    "we now consider the jet development after the breakout , with the inner engine still active . at this stage , which has not been investigated in numerical simulations so far , it is likely that dissipation will have a lesser role , since the jet , as we shall see , is de - collimated rather than recollimated .",
    "as the jet reaches the stellar surface , it clears a channel for the cocoon .",
    "the cocoon material is therefore now free to expand out of the star and its pressure drops .",
    "we assume that from this moment on the shock between the cocoon and the cold stellar material stalls , as a consequence of the dropping cocoon pressure .",
    "this is equivalent to assuming a constant volume of the cocoon cavity inside the star .",
    "the pressure drop for the relativistic cocoon can be derived through @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the area of the free surface through which the cocoon material expands , @xmath51 the cocoon energy density and @xmath52 is the sound speed of the relativistic gas .",
    "writing the cocoon volume as @xmath53 , we can obtain the pressure evolution : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the cocoon pressure at the moment of shock breakout .",
    "as the cocoon pressure decreases , fresh jet material passing through the cocoon is less tightly collimated . under isentropic conditions the jet lorentz factor increases linearly with the opening angle and pressure balance yields @xmath56 , implying an exponentially increasing opening angle of the form",
    ", the jet would freely expand to an angle @xmath57 of the order of a few degrees .",
    "this would result in an initially constant opening angle .",
    "the only effect on the final energy distribution of eq .",
    "[ eq : wow ] is to increase the size of the jet core from @xmath58 to @xmath59 . ]",
    "\\label{eq : thopen}\\ ] ] dissipative jet propagation gives similar results ( with merely a different numerical coefficient @xmath61 inside the exponential ) , provided that @xmath21 varies roughly as a power of @xmath18 .",
    "the angular distribution of integrated energy , as observed in the afterglow phase , is computed by integrating the instantaneous luminosity per unit solid angle from the moment the jet becomes visible along a given line of sight ( @xmath62 ) until the end of the burst : @xmath63 @xmath62 is obtained by inverting eq .  [ eq : thopen ] .",
    "such integration is valid provided that the jet opening angle at time @xmath64 is smaller than the natural opening angle of the jet : @xmath65 . for the fiducial numbers assumed ( @xmath66  cm , @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) this corresponds to @xmath69  s comoving burst duration .",
    "interesting effects should be expected for longer bursts , as discussed in   4 .",
    "assuming a jet with constant luminosity @xmath70 and for all the lines of sight that satisfy @xmath71 , eq .",
    "[ eq : struj0 ] gives the jet structure @xmath72 and @xmath73constant inside the core radius @xmath58 .",
    "this angular dependence , which characterizes a `` structured jet '' or `` universal jet '' ( rossi et al .",
    "2002 , 2004 ; zhang & meszaros 2002 ; salmonson 2003 ; lamb , donaghy & graziani 2003 ) , is of high theoretical interest",
    ". jets with this beam pattern reproduce afterglow observations .",
    "if the jet is powered by fall - back of material from the star to the accretion disk , the mass accretion rate would be anti - correlated with the radius of the star , for a given stellar mass .",
    "this would produce a roughly constant value of @xmath74 that would reproduce the so - called frail relation ( frail et al .",
    "2001 ; panaitescu & kumar 2001 ) as a purely viewing - angle phenomenon . in this case",
    "all jets would be alike , but different observers would see them from different angles , deriving different energetics .    in the above equations we have assumed for simplicity that the jet reaching the surface of the star is uniform . as shown by simulations ( e.g. zhang et al . 2003 ) , it is more likely that a gaussian jet emerges from the star . on the contrary , boundary layers may be produced by the interaction of the jet with the collimating star , resulting in edge brightened jets ( see the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : pat ] ) .",
    "it can be shown easily that the @xmath0 pattern does not depend on the assumption of uniformity .",
    "[ fig : pat ] shows the integrated energy distribution for uniform , gaussian and hollow intrinsic jets .",
    "even though small differences are present at the edges ( the jet core and the outskirts ) , the general behavior is always @xmath75 .",
    "our prediction that the jet opening angle evolves with time has two major , in principle testable , consequences .",
    "first , the brightness of a typical grb should tend to decrease with time , assuming a constant efficiency of gamma - ray production , since the photon flux at earth is proportional to the energy per unit solid angle .",
    "this behavior is certainly seen in fred ( fast rise exponential decay ) single pulsed events , while it is harder to make a quantitative comparison in the case of complex light curves .",
    "some events , like the bright grb  990123 , have multi - peaked lightcurves which show a clear fading at late times . on the other hand there",
    "exist rare events , such as grb  980923 , in which an increase of luminosity with time is observed . lacking afterglow observations , it is hard to determine whether such events are peculiar .    to understand the second consequence of the model ,",
    "consider an observer at an angle @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the jet opening angle at breakout .",
    "initially , this observer lies outside the beaming cone and does not detect the grb .",
    "later , as the jet spreads beyond @xmath78 , the observer detects the burst .",
    "the beginning of the grb emission is therefore observer dependent .",
    "this causes a correlation between the burst duration and energetics : the longer the burst the larger its detected energy output .",
    "a correlation between burst duration and fluence is detected in the batse sample but whether it is intrinsic or due to systematic effects is still a matter of debate .",
    "finally , if any isotropic emission should mark the jet breakout ( macfadyen & woosley 1999 ; ramirez - ruiz , macfadyen & lazzati 2002 ) , such emission would not be followed immediately by @xmath1-rays for observers lying outside of @xmath77 .",
    "this delay may explain the unusually long delays between precursors and main emission detected in several batse grbs ( lazzati 2005 ) .",
    "some complications can arise for very compact stars and/or very long - lived jets . in computing the energy profile ( eq .",
    "[ eq : wow ] ) we have implicitly assumed that the jet expands exponentially until it dies .",
    "this approximation obviously fails if the engine is long - lived , since at some point the jet reaches its natural opening angle  determined , e.g. , by the accretion disk geometry  and the expansion stops .",
    "alternatively for some combination of the parameters , the cocoon may occupy a small opening angle ( eq .  [ eq : thc ] ) .",
    "as the jet expands , it eventually hits the cold star material and a different expansion law , driven by the jet pressure onto the stellar material , sets in .",
    "again , the expansion of the jet is slowed down and as a consequence a shallower distribution of energy with off - axis angle is expected . such modifications to the @xmath0 law",
    "would manifest themselves in the late stages of the afterglow evolution .",
    "the higher than expected energy at large angles would flatten the light curve decay or produce a bump in the afterglow .",
    "such behavior has been claimed in several radio afterglows ( frail et al .",
    "2004 ; panaitescu & kumar 2004 ) , and could also explain the two breaks observed in the light curve of grb  030329 . if the outflow reaches its natural opening angle or crashes into the cold stellar material while still active , the time - integrated jet can be described as the sum of a @xmath0 jet plus a roughly uniform jet with a larger opening angle  in other words , a two - component jet ( berger et al .",
    "this behavior is tantalizing also if we consider the interaction from the point of view of the star .",
    "the expansion of the cocoon drives a shock wave into the cold stellar material where it deposits approximately @xmath79  erg ( zhang et al .",
    "2003 ; lazzati & begelman in preparation ) .",
    "if the cocoon is small and the jet comes into contact with the star while still active and expanding , additional energy is given to the star .",
    "complex afterglows should therefore be associated with particularly energetic hypernov , such as sn2003dh .",
    "in this letter we have analyzed the evolution of a grb jet during its transition from stellar confinement to free expansion .",
    "we focused mainly on the resulting angular structure of the outflow , and reached two main conclusions .",
    "first , the angular structure of the jet in the afterglow phase does not necessarily reflect the way in which the energy is released by the inner engine . if the jet opening angle is not constant during the @xmath69  s of the engine activity , the angular structure of the jet results from the integration of this evolution and has little to do with the pristine beam pattern .",
    "second , we analyzed the most probable evolution in the collapsar scenario .",
    "we find that the interaction of the jet with the surrounding cocoon causes the opening angle to increase exponentially with time .",
    "this evolution , for a constant energy release from the inner engine and independently of the intrinsic beam pattern , produces an angular structure with @xmath75 .",
    "such an energy distribution produces a broken power - law afterglow ( rossi et al .",
    "2002 , 2004 ; salmonson 2003 , kumar & granot 2003 ; granot & kumar 2003 ) .",
    "it can also explain the so - called frail relation ( frail et al .",
    "2001 ; panaitescu & kumar 2001 ) if @xmath80 is roughly constant for different grbs .",
    "the origin of this energy distribution is here explained for the first time in the context of hydrodynamical fireballs ( see lyutikov et al .",
    "2003 for a discussion on the context of electromagnetically dominated fireballs ) .",
    "we briefly discuss in   4 some testable prediction of this model .",
