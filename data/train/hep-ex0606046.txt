    "data from hadron production in @xmath0  annihilation experiments has been one of the main sources of experimental information for the study of non - perturbative qcd of hadron jets , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "compared to other processes where power corrections have been studied such as hadron production in deep inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering  @xcite there are two main advantages :    leptonic initial state : :    the incoming electron and positron are leptons and thus there is no    interference between initial state and the hadronic final state .",
    "this    makes the interpretation of of the final state in terms of qcd much    more robust .",
    "large range of energies : :    the currently available data from    @xmath0  annihilation to hadrons span a range of    centre - of - mass ( cms ) energies of more than an order of magnitude .    since many effects in qcd depend on the energy scale comparing data    sets recorded at different cms energies yields strong tests of the    theory .    from reconstructed hadronic final states jet production or event shape observables",
    "are calculated , see e.q .  @xcite . as an example the observable thrust @xmath2",
    "is defined by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the 3-momentum of particle @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "a value of @xmath7 corresponds to an ideal 2-jet event , events with three final state objects have @xmath8 while completely spherical events with many final state particles can approach @xmath9 .",
    "event shape observables @xmath10 are conventionally defined to have @xmath11 for ideal two - jet configurations and thus the thrust is often analysed in terms of  @xmath12 .",
    "the observables can be classified as 3-jet or 4-jet observables depending on whether @xmath13 occurs in the cms for final states with @xmath14 or @xmath15 objects .",
    "the energy of the electron and electron beams in most @xmath0annihilation collider experiments is equal due to the simplified construction and operation of a circular accelerator with only one beam line . as a consequence the cms of hadronic final states produced in @xmath0  annihilation coincides with the laboratory system in the absence of hard initial state radiation ( isr ) .",
    "a typical @xmath0  annihilation experiment is shown in figure  [ fig_jade ] .",
    "the jade detector ( for details see  @xcite ) was operated at the petra accelerator  @xcite from 1979 to 1986 at cms energies @xmath16  gev .",
    "the design of the experiment is similar to the more recent lep experiments .",
    "the interaction region , where the electron and positron beams collide , is surrounded by gaseous tracking detectors ( jet chamber ) inside a solenoidal magnetic field of 0.48  t. the tracking detectors are inside a calorimeter consisting of 2712 lead glass blocks to measure the energy of charged and neutral particles .",
    "tracking and calorimeter efficiency is good in the region @xmath17 were @xmath18 is the angle w.r.t .",
    "the beam axis .",
    "therefore most @xmath0  annihilation events are fully contained in the detector and complete reconstruction with high efficiency and good precision is possible .",
    "this reduces the size of experimental corrections for acceptance and resolution and thus the corresponding experimental uncertainties .",
    "the experimental conditions vary significantly between the various cms energies of the data sets .",
    "figure  [ fig_data ] ( left )  @xcite shows the measured cross sections of several @xmath0  annihilation processes as a function of the cms energy @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath20 dependence as expected from qed at low @xmath19  is clearly visible . at the @xmath21  peak around @xmath22",
    "gev the cross sections increase by a factor of about 100 compared to their lowest values at @xmath23  gev or @xmath24  gev .    at @xmath25 background from two - photon interactions with hadronic final states ( @xmath26 ) , from production of @xmath1-lepton pairs decaying to hadrons and from hadronic final states with isr and",
    "thus reduced cms is significant . requiring more than four tracks of charged particles ( events with exactly four tracks not in a 1- vs 3-prong configuration",
    "may also be accepted  @xcite ) reduces the backgrounds from @xmath1-pairs and two - photon interactions to negligible levels .",
    "the data collected on or near the @xmath21  peak are essentially free of backgrounds due to the high energy and large cross section .",
    "isr effects are also suppressed .",
    "the high energy samples taken by the lep experiments during the lep  2 phase have again backgrounds from two - photon interactions , isr and for @xmath27  gev from production of four - fermion final states dominated by @xmath28  pairs decaying to hadrons .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the analysis  @xcite defines an effective charge @xmath29 via @xmath30 .",
    "the relation between @xmath29 and @xmath31 is known perturbatively .",
    "figure  [ fig_softfreeze ] ( right ) shows the variable @xmath29 as a function of @xmath32 extracted from the data ( shaded bands ) and using different predictions ( lines ) .",
    "the band from analysis of the inclusive spectrum labelled `` @xmath33 '' stays fairly flat down to @xmath34  gev@xmath35 and then rises steeply due to the @xmath36 resonance .",
    "the other bands are from analysis of spectra for even or odd number of pions in the final state and have strong non - perturbative effects .",
    "the solid line labelled `` @xmath37 4 loop @xmath38 '' corresponds to the most complete qcd prediction for the running of the effective charge including an estimate of 4th order term .",
    "this prediction describes the data well down to @xmath39  gev@xmath35 and stays finite at @xmath40 .",
    "one also observes that the nnlo prediction labelled `` @xmath37 3 loop '' also describes the data at medium values of @xmath32 and is finite at @xmath40 .",
    "it is thus possible to consistently describe data for hadronic @xmath1 decays down to @xmath41  gev@xmath35 with an effective coupling which stays finite at @xmath40 .",
    "these observations are consistent with earlier work  @xcite .",
    "in this review several topics were not covered due to a lack of results .",
    "one issue is the study of 4-jet event shape observables in the planar limit .",
    "the theoretical aspects and preliminary experimental results are discussed in contributions b001 and b002 to this conference .",
    "however , there are no published experimental studies which could be subject of this review , but hopefully there will be results on this important subject in the near future .",
    "other models for the description of soft corrections to hard qcd processes such as shape functions , the single - dressed - gluon approximation ( sdg ) are subject of contributions to this conference but there are no detailed experimental studies . from an experimental point of view",
    "the dmw model is attractive , because it makes strong predictions about relations between observables and has only universal free parameters .",
    "also , predictions actually exist for several observables such that direct comparisons are possible .      *",
    "the values for @xmath42  from different observables are consistent within 20 to 30% .",
    "however , it has to be understood if this is a variation one expects from the theoretical uncertainties in the calculations .",
    "it is often claimed that the theoretical uncertainty on the milan factor @xmath43 of about 20% due to missing higher order terms could explain the scatter of @xmath42  results .",
    "however , since @xmath43 is a universal factor it is not clear if it can explain differences between different observables . *",
    "the values for @xmath44  from different observables are consistent with each other within the uncertainties of the perturbative qcd calculations as expected .",
    "however , direct comparison of the results from power correction analyses and analyses with hadronisation corrections derived from monte carlo simulation show a systematic bias for @xmath44  of about 6% ( mean values ) or 9% ( distributions ) .",
    "this bias is comparable to or larger than the total uncertainties quoted for determinations of @xmath44  from event shape or jet observables in @xmath0  annihilation .",
    "the bias is significantly larger than the hadronisation model uncertainties of less than 2% quoted for @xmath44  determinations using lep data  @xcite .    in the future",
    "the studies of power corrections with @xmath0  annihilation data would profit from further analyses using the jade data in the intermediate energy region @xmath45  gev . in particular the eec and 4-jet observables with or without requiring the planar limit would be attractive subjects",
    ".    the impact of nnlo perturbative qcd calculations for 3-jet observables could also be significant .",
    "firstly , the power correction calculations will have to adapted to the improved predictions .",
    "secondly , with there is potential for high precision measurements of @xmath44  with reduced theoretical uncertainties . with selected observables with",
    "suppressed power corrections such as @xmath46  one could obtain the matching reduced hadronisation uncertainties .",
    "other approaches to understand soft corrections in terms of qcd should be studied in more detail .",
    "the connection with rs optimisation discussed in contributions t001 and t002 is also an interesting new area of research .",
