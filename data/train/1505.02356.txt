    "spontaneous breakdown of continuous symmetries gives rise to topological defects ( texture solitons ) of various kinds .",
    "in particular , if the first homotopy group of the group space of the broken symmetry group is nontrivial , then a linear topological defect known as the abrikosov - nielsen - olesen ( ano ) vortex @xcite is formed . the vortex is described classically in terms of a spin-0 ( higgs ) field which condenses and a spin-1 field which corresponds to the spontaneously broken gauge group ; the former is coupled to the latter in the minimal way with constant @xmath0 .",
    "the transverse size of the vortex is of the order of the correlation length , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the mass of the condensate field .",
    "single - valuedness of the condensate field and finiteness of the vortex energy implement that the vortex flux is related to @xmath0 : @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the vector potential of the spin-1 gauge field , and the integral is over a path enclosing the vortex tube once .",
    "the quantized matter field is coupled minimally to the spin-1 field with constant @xmath5 ; thus quantum effects in the background of the ano vortex depend on the value of @xmath6 .",
    "the case of @xmath7 @xmath8 , half of the london flux quantum ) is realized in ordinary bardeen - cooper - schrieffer superconductors where the cooper - pair field condenses and , in addition , there are normal electron ( pair - breaking ) excitations , see @xcite ; the cases of fractional values of @xmath9 can be realized in chiral superfluids , liquid crystals and quantum liquids , see @xcite .",
    "an issue of ano vortices under the name of cosmic strings is widely discussed in the context of astrophysics and cosmology for more than three decades @xcite .",
    "the formation of such topological defects during the cosmological expansion is predicted in most interesting models of high energy physics , providing an important link between cosmology and particle physics , see review in @xcite .",
    "cosmic strings serve as plausible sources of detectable gravitational waves , high - energy cosmic rays and gamma - ray bursts @xcite .",
    "while considering the effect of the ano vortices on the vacuum of quantum matter , the following circumstance should be kept in mind : the phase with broken symmetry exists outside the vortex and the vacuum is to be defined only there ; hence the quantum matter field is not permitted to penetrate inside the vortex , obeying a boundary condition at its side surface .",
    "further , we shall assume that the interaction between the ano vortex and the quantum matter field is mediated by the vector potential of the vortex - forming spin-1 field only .",
    "the direct coupling between the vortex - forming spin-0 field and the quantum matter field can be neglected .",
    "the latter is consistent with the requirement that the compton wavelength of the quantum matter field is much larger than the transverse size of the vortex , and this requirement will be substantiated in the course of the present study .",
    "thus , the ano vortex has no effect on the surrounding matter in the framework of classical theory , and such an effect , if exists , is of purely quantum nature .",
    "the effect should be denoted as a quantum - field - theoretical manifestation of the famous aharonov - bohm effect @xcite , see review @xcite , and is characterized by the periodic dependence on the value of the vortex flux , @xmath10 , with the period equal to the london flux quantum , @xmath11 .    in the present paper",
    ", we shall study the current and the magnetic field which are induced in the vacuum of the quantized charged scalar matter field by the ano vortex .",
    "these vacuum characteristics were considered previously in the approximation neglecting the transverse size of the vortex , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the aim of the present study is to take account for the nonvanishing transverse size .",

    "@xcite where the casimir energy and force in the background of the ano vortex are studied .",
    "the quantized matter field is assumed to vanish at the side surface of the vortex , and the tension spread over the vortex is neglected ; natural units @xmath12 will be used in the following .",

    "the coordinate system is chosen in such a way that the tube is along the @xmath29 axis .",
    "the tube in 3-dimensional space is obviously generalized to the @xmath30-tube in @xmath31-dimensional space by adding extra @xmath32 dimensions as longitudinal ones .",

    "however , a direct numerical computation in the case of @xmath129 is a rather complicated task , needing a long computational time . to surmount these difficulties ,",

    "a perfectly reflecting ( dirichlet ) boundary condition is imposed on the matter field at the side surface of the vortex .",
    "the induced current is circulating around the vortex , and the induced magnetic field is directed along the vortex .",
    "both the current and the magnetic field are vanishingly small in the case of the vortex transverse size being of the order of or exceeding the compton wavelength of the matter field ( the dimensionless current is less than @xmath152 , the dimensionless total flux of the magnetic field is less then @xmath153 in the @xmath145 case ) .",
    "together with the results of @xcite about the casimir force acting on the vortex side surface , this confirms the conclusion that the vacuum polarization of the quantized matter is almost absent in the case when the mass of the higgs field ( forming the topological defect ) is of the order of or less than the mass of the matter field ; the vacuum polarization effects are essential for matter fields with masses which are much smaller than a scale of the spontaneous symmetry breaking ( higgs mass ) . as to the induced vacuum current and magnetic field in the background of the ano vortex ,",
    "we show in the present paper that they are essential in this latter case , being odd in the value of the vortex flux , @xmath10 , and periodic in this value with with the period equal the london flux quantum , @xmath154 ; to be more precise , they vanish at @xmath155 , where @xmath156 is given by , and are of opposite signs in the intervals @xmath157 and @xmath158 , with their absolute values being symmetric with respect to the point @xmath159 .",
    "the current and the magnetic field decrease exponentially at large distances from the vortex , while otherwise they behave similarly to the case of a singular filament ( vanishing transverse size ) with the exception of a small vicinity of the vortex tube .",
    "the latter distinction allows us to eliminate an unphysical divergence which is present at @xmath160 for the total induced vacuum magnetic flux in the case of a singular filament . as long as the nonvanishing transverse size of the vortex is taken into account , the total induced vacuum magnetic flux becomes finite , attaining quite realistic values for the case of the three - dimensional space even at the spontaneous symmetry breaking scale exceeding the mass of the matter field by just three orders of magnitude , see fig.5 and table 1 .",
