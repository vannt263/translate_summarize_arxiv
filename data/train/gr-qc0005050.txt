    "the definition of a photon surface given in section [ photonsurfacesection ] is valid in an arbitrary space - time .",
    "however the result that a photon surface must have a second fundamental form which is pure trace indicates that a space - time must be specialized in some respect if it is to contain any photon surfaces . for spherically symmetric space - times there are always photon surfaces that respect the spherical symmetry . for space - times that are not spherically symmetric",
    ", the definitions of a photon surface and @xmath121-invariant photon surface may seem too restrictive .",
    "the problem is that , in general , one may not have orbiting null geodesics at a fixed radius . in kerr space - time for example , although there are orbiting null geodesics in the equatorial plane , those null geodesics which move in the direction of rotation do so at a different radius than those which move in the opposite direction .",
    "but it seems implausible that a concept which is physically important in the case of exact spherical symmetry should become invalid when even a small amount of angular momentum is introduced .",
    "a non - trivial generalization of the concepts of photon surface and @xmath121-invariant photon surface , at least to axially symmetric space - times , is thus required .",
