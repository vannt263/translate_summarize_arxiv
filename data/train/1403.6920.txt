    "polyominoes are , roughly speaking , plane figures obtained by joining squares of equal size edge to edge .",
    "their appearance origins in recreational mathematics but also has been subject of many combinatorial investigations including tiling problems . a connection of polyominoes to commutative algebra has first been established by the second author of this paper by assigning to each polyomino its ideal of inner minors , see @xcite .",
    "this class of ideals widely generalizes the ideal of @xmath0-minors of a matrix of indeterminates , and even that of the ideal of 2-minors of two - sided ladders .",
    "it also includes the meet - join ideal of plane distributive lattices .",
    "those classical ideals have been extensively studied in the literature , see for example @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "typically one determines for such ideals their grbner bases , determines their resolution and computes their regularity , checks whether the rings defined by them are normal , cohen - macaulay or gorenstein .",
    "a first step in this direction for the inner minors of a polyomino ( also called polyomino ideals ) has been done by qureshi in the afore mentioned paper .",
    "very recently those convex polyominoes have been classified in @xcite whose ideal of inner minors is linearly related or has a linear resolution .",
    "for some special polyominoes also the regularity of the ideal of inner minors is known , see @xcite .    in this paper , for balanced polyominoes , we provide some positive answers to the questions addressed before . to define a balanced polyomino , one labels the vertices of a polyomino by integer numbers in a way that row and column sums are zero along intervals that belong to the polyomino .",
    "such a labeling is called admissible .",
    "there is a natural way to attach to each admissible labeling of a polyomino @xmath1 a binomial .",
    "the given polyomino is called balanced if all the binomials arising from admissible labelings belong to the ideal of inner minors @xmath2 of @xmath1 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath1 is balanced if and only if @xmath2 coincides with the lattice ideal determined by @xmath1 , see proposition  [ ilambda ] .",
    "this is the main observation of section  [ innerminors ] where we provide the basic definitions regarding polyominoes and their ideals of inner minors .",
    "an important consequence of proposition  [ ilambda ] is the result stated in corollary  [ primep ] which asserts that for any balanced polyomino @xmath1 , the ideal @xmath2 is a prime ideal and that its height coincides with the number of cells of @xmath1 .",
    "it is conjectured in @xcite by the second author of this paper that @xmath2 is a prime ideal for any simple polyomino @xmath1",
    ". a polyomino is called simple if it has no ` holes ' , see section  [ innerminors ] for the precise definition .",
    "we expect that simple polyominoes are balanced .",
    "this would then imply qureshi s conjecture .    in section 2",
    "we identify the primitive binomials of a balanced polyomino ( theorem  [ primitive ] ) and deduce from this that for a balanced polyomino @xmath1 the ideal @xmath2 has a squarefree initial ideal for any monomial order .",
    "this then implies , as shown in corollary  [ balancedcm ] , that the residue class ring of @xmath2 is a normal cohen - macaulay domain .",
    "finally , in section  [ classes ] we show that all row or column convex , and all tree - like polyminoes are simple and balanced .",
