    "this approach is useful because light quark condensates are active close to the ground state of qcd and give rise to highly collective interactions .",
    "pions and kaons are the most prominent light quark systems , but data available for elastic @xmath2 scattering are scarce and decades old",
    ". they were obtained from the lass spectrometer at slac@xcite , in the range @xmath9 gev , by isolating one - pion exchanges in the reaction @xmath10 . in the last ten years",
    ", information about @xmath2 interactions was also produced by hadronic decays of @xmath11 mesons .",
    "in particular , data from the e791 and focus collaborations@xcite for the reaction @xmath12 allowed the @xmath13-wave @xmath2 sub - amplitude to be extracted continuously from threshold up to the high energy border of the dalitz plot .",
    "hope was then raised that these data could improve the description of elastic @xmath2 scattering .",
    "however , decay data differ significantly from those given by the lass experiment and this discrepancy motivates our interest in this problem .",
    "the description of the decay @xmath12 must include both the weak @xmath14 vertex and hadronic final state interactions ( fsis ) , which correspond to strong processes occurring between primary decay and detection .",
    "the study of weak vertices departs from the topological structures given by chao@xcite , which implement ckm quark mixing for processes involving a single @xmath15 . as",
    "primary decays occur in the presence of light quark condensates , the direct incorporation of chao s scheme into calculations is not trivial and one is forced into hadronic descriptions .",
    "these include both the use of form factors in weak vertices , as in the work of bauer , stich and wirbel@xcite , and the treatment of relativistic final state interactions .",
    "high - energy few - body calculations begin to be available now@xcite and several works have already employed field theory to fsis in heavy meson decays@xcite .    in this work ,",
    "the decay @xmath12 is treated by means of chiral effective lagrangians , supplemented by phenomenological form factors .",
    "this framework is motivated by the smallness of the @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath5 masses , when compared with the qcd scale @xmath18gev .",
    "the light sector of the theory is therefore not far from the massless limit , which is symmetric under the chiral @xmath19 flavour group . in this approach ,",
    "light condensates arise naturally and pseudoscalar mesons are described as goldstone bosons .",
    "quark masses are incorporated perturbatively into effective lagrangians@xcite , whereas weak interactions are treated as external sources .",
    "chiral perturbation theory was originally designed to describe low - energy interactions , where it yields the most reliable representation of qcd available at present .",
    "its scope was later enlarged , with the inclusion of resonances as chiral corrections@xcite , and the unitary ressummation of diagrams@xcite .",
    "suitable coupling schemes also allow the incorporation of heavy mesons@xcite .",
    "a similar theoretical framework has already been employed by our group@xcite , in an exploratory study of fsis in @xmath0 . with the purpose of taming an involved calculation , in that work we made a number of simplifying assumptions . among them , the weak vertices were taken to be constants , isospin @xmath20 and @xmath21 waves were not included in intermediate @xmath2 amplitudes , and couplings to either vector mesons or inelastic channels were neglected . in spite of these limitations , that work allowed the identification of leading dynamical mechanisms and gave rise to results which are reasonable for the modulus and good for the phase of the @xmath13-wave @xmath2 sub - amplitude@xcite . in this work , we focus on the vector weak amplitude and improve the description of the weak vertex , by including both the correct momentum dependence and better phenomenology for an intermediate @xmath1 subamplitude , and the description of a @xmath2 subamplitude at higher energies .",

    "inclusion of final state interactions , due to successive elastic @xmath2 scatterings@xcite , yields three families of diagrams , as in figs.[fsi ] .",

    "processes involving resonances have already been considered in refs.@xcite , whereas quasi two - body axial fsis were discussed ref.@xcite .",
    "an important lesson drawn from our previous study@xcite is that , for some yet unknown reason , the vector weak amplitude , represented by diagram @xmath28 of fig.[fampw ] , seems to be favoured by data@xcite .",

    "as far as the phase is concerned , the most prominent feature is the fact that it has a large negative value at threshold . in qcd",
