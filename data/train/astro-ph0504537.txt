    "the spatial distribution of the galactic warm ionized medium ( wim ) is characterized by a thin and a thick layer .",
    "the _ thin layer _ consists of ionized gas located on the galactic plane and composed of discrete hii regions and diffuse gas .",
    "the _ thick layer _ consists instead of the ionized gas which is situated well above the plane and presents only a diffuse - gas component .",
    "current models of the wim ( miller @xmath8 cox 1993 ; domgrgen @xmath8 mathis 1994 ) tend to favour a scenario in which the presence of ionized gas in the thick layer is due to ultraviolet radiation leaking out of regions of star formation located in the thin layer . in the light of these models , knowledge of the physical properties of",
    "the thin layer is crucial for understanding the mechanisms regulating the global distribution of the warm ionized gas .",
    "however , despite its relevance , systematic investigations of the thin layer have not been carried out to date .",
    "complementary information on the wim comes from pulsar dispersion measurements ( dms ) which are linearly weighted by the electron density , @xmath9 , rather than weighted by @xmath10 as in the case of the @xmath11 and of the radio free - free emission discussed here .",
    "the dm data imply an inner galactic electron layer of scale height @xmath12pc ( taylor @xmath8 cordes 1993 ) ; these data are spatially undersampled however and do not have the angular resolution of the data used in the present study .",
    "this paper investigates the thin layer by combining the information on the diffuse component derived from radio continuum surveys with the information on the galactic hii region distribution as given in paladini , davies @xmath8 de zotti ( 2003 ) .",
    "in particular , we estimate the contribution of the discrete , hii component with respect to the diffuse component .",
    "we emphasize that our analysis is also of interest for foreground studies in the context of cmb observations as well as for investigations of the ism .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .  2 we present the data base used for the analysis .",
    "in sect .  3 we discuss the importance of an accurate determination of the zero levels for the surveys involved and we describe the methods applied to our case . in sect",
    "4 we illustrate the results of the component separation technique in deriving the latitude distribution of free - free and synchrotron emission . in sect .  5 we estimate the contribution of discrete hii regions to the total free - free emissions .",
    "for the analysis of the diffuse ionized gas adjacent to the galactic plane , we make use of radio continuum data .",
    "as well known , an ionized gas in the physical conditions of the interstellar medium ( @xmath13 k , @xmath14 0.1 @xmath15 ) emits a continuum spectrum at radio frequencies due to coulomb interaction of free electrons with ions ( thermal bremsstrahlung or _ free - free radiation _ ) .",
    "the use of radio data offers various advantages with respect to other tracers : this continuum radiation is not subject to extinction from interstellar dust grains ( as the h@xmath16 emission ) and it does not suffer from undersampling ( as in the case of pulsar dispersion measures ) .",
    "an important drawback , however , for radio continuum data results from the fact that the observed emission is the superposition of the free - free emission and of the synchrotron radiation produced by relativistic electrons accelerated in the galactic magnetic field .",
    "therefore , the use of such data for investigating the ionized gas requires a decomposition of the observed signal into its constituents .",
    "this can be achieved by exploiting the spectral dependence of each component when data are available at least at two frequencies .",
    "the first step is the selection of a region of the galaxy in which to carry out the analysis .",
    "this is followed by the choice of the data sets covering the selected region .",
    "for the selection of the galactic region we follow these guidelines : we look for an area surveyed at several frequencies , close to the plane and in a longitude range where we expect the emission from the ionized gas to be particularly bright . at the same time",
    ", we try to avoid regions in which the source of emission is not fully understood such as areas located in the proximity of the galactic centre . according to these criteria , we select the longitude range @xmath1 which includes the sagittarius - carina and the scutum - crux arms ; the latter is tangent at @xmath17 .",
    "the galactic plane emission is well - defined in this region .",
    "the three surveys with accurate calibrations and well - determined baselines are the 1.4 ghz survey by reich et al .",
    "( 1990a ) , the 2.7 ghz survey by reich et al .",
    "( 1990b ) and the 5 ghz survey by haynes et al .",
    "they cover a sufficient frequency range for an adequate separation of synchrotron and free - free emission components .",
    "it is also important to stress that the angular resolution of these surveys enables us to perform an analysis of the warm ionized gas in the galactic plane on a 10@xmath18 scale .",
    "it is for this reason that we have not used the 408 mhz data of haslam et al .",
    "( 1982 ) at 51@xmath18 resolution .",
    "our study , as a consequence , covers the latitude range @xmath19 defined by the 5 ghz survey .",
    "all the maps used for this work have been downloaded from the mpifr web site : http://www.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/survey.html .",
    "details about the surveys are given below and summarized in table  1 .",

    "the baseline level of the total intensity map has been determined from the large area stockert 1.4 ghz survey ( reich 1982 ; reich @xmath8 reich 1986 ) made with a resolution of 35.9@xmath18 . the absolute level of emission is derived by comparison with the howell @xmath8 shakeshaft ( 1967 ) measurements and is believed to be accurate to 0.5 k. the temperature calibration based on standard radio sources is accurate to @xmath22 .",

    "the latitude range @xmath26 to 4@xmath27 was scanned at the same scan separation but in both galactic coordinates . for @xmath28",
    "the large - scale structures have been added by using low - resolution data ( @xmath29 ) at 2.7 ghz taken with the stockert telescope ( reif et al .",
    "zero level fluctuations are reported of order of 100 mk .",
    "the effelsberg data and the low - resolution data have been combined into a final map .",
    "the temperature calibration accuracy is believed to be @xmath22 .",
    "the 2.7 ghz data corrected for the cmb and extragalactic sources are plotted in fig .  1 .",
    "the 5 ghz survey was made using the parkes 64-m telescope and has an angular resolution of @xmath30 .",
    "it covers @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the primary scan direction was chosen to be either right ascension or declination , whichever was nearer to being orthogonal to the galactic plane .",
    "in particular , the longitude range @xmath33 was scanned in right ascension , with primary scans separated by 2@xmath34 .",
    "the region of the sky to be surveyed was divided into blocks , each block being @xmath35 16 square degrees in area .",
    "baseline levels within each block were set by reference to two tie - down scans to points well off the galactic plane so as to determine a consistent base level .",
    "the baseline uncertainty was estimated to be 0.2 k and the temperature accuracy was @xmath36 .",
    "a few steps of data processing have been taken prior to the realization of the component separation .",
    "the 5 ghz map is characterized by a significant number of negative pixels  typically at the border of the map  which correspond to unobserved regions and result from the adopted scanning strategy .",
    "no interpolation over these bad pixels has been performed since these regions are far too extended to allow us to fill the gaps in a realistic , reliable way .",
    "we have therefore carried out our analysis considering , for each frequency , only the pixels with a positive , detected signal .",
    "all the maps have been pixelized at the level of the 5 ghz map , i.e. to @xmath37 pixel and the 2.7 and 5 ghz maps have been convolved to 9.4@xmath18 , the angular resolution of the 1.4 ghz map . due to the missing pixel problem",
    ", the convolution introduces some level of error in the 5 ghz map .",
    "however , this error concerns only a very limited number of pixels ( namely , the ones at the scan borders ) and we expect it not to be dominant in the global error budget .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , it is possible to perform the separation of the free - free emission from the synchrotron emission by exploiting the information on their spectral behaviour .",
    "however , this method is subject to large errors if the zero levels of each survey have not been accurately determined .",
    "following reich @xmath8 reich ( 1988 ) , we write the observed sky brightness temperature @xmath38 at any point and at a frequency @xmath39 as the sum of various contributions :    @xmath40    in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , @xmath41 is the galactic brightness temperature ; @xmath42 is the brightness temperature of the cosmic microwave background ( @xmath43k , fixsen et al .",
    "1996 ) ; @xmath44 is the contribution of the unresolved extragalactic sources ; @xmath45 is the zero level correction .",
    "the contribution of the extragalactic background is of order of few mk at these frequencies , i.e. much less than any baseline uncertainty , so that it can be neglected in the calculation .",
    "while the zero level of the 1.4 ghz survey has been accurately set , the zero levels of the 2.7 and 5 ghz surveys have to be estimated . for this purpose",
    ", we make use of auxiliary data at 408 mhz ( haslam et al . 1982 ) and 2.3 ghz ( jonas et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the haslam full - sky survey has an angular resolution of 0.85@xmath27 and its temperature scale is believed to be accurate to within 10@xmath7 .",
    "in addition , it is characterized by a well - known offset of 3 k. we have used the version of the 408-mhz survey obtained by d.p .",
    "finkbeiner , m. davis @xmath8 d. schlegel ( private communication ) .",
    "they have removed point sources and destriped the map by applying a fourier filtering technique .",
    "the 2.3 ghz survey , which has been carried out with the hartrao 26-m telescope , covers 67@xmath7 of the sky with a resolution of 20@xmath18 . the estimated uncertainty in the temperature scale is less than 5@xmath7 and the quoted error in the absolute zero is 80 mk in any direction .",
    "the version of the 2.3 ghz map that we have used is that supplied by platania et al .",
    "( 2003 ) which has point sources removed and has been destriped .",
    "it is important to point out that the jonas et al .",
    "survey is polarization dependent and its absolute zero level has been set by comparison with the haslam et al .",
    "408 mhz survey .",
    "this fact implies that our determination of the 2.7 and 5 ghz zero levels are based both , in practice , on the 408 mhz baseline accuracy . at each frequency",
    "( 2.7 and 5 ghz ) , the strategy adopted for setting the zero level takes into account the specific features of the survey .",
    "the effelsberg 11-com survey extends up to @xmath46 . for these latitutes , in the region @xmath47 , we estimate the contribution from the free - free emission .",
    "this is obtained using the dickinson et al .",
    "( 2003 ) h@xmath16 map . following the lines described in the paper , the observed h@xmath16",
    "is first corrected for absorption by means of the 100-@xmath48 m dust template given by schlegel , finkbeiner @xmath8 davis ( 1998 ) and the assumption of a non - uniform mixing of ionized gas and dust   as the effective dust fraction in the line of sight actually absorbing the h@xmath16 and set @xmath49 . ] .",
    "the corrected h@xmath16 is then converted into free - free emission using eq .",
    "( 11 ) in the dickinson et al .",
    "paper . the derived free - free emission contribution",
    "is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "as stated in sect .  2 , the h@xmath16 is not a reliable indicator of free - free emission for regions close to the galactic plane .",
    "however , as the figure shows , at @xmath50=@xmath51 5@xmath27 the derived free - free emission still agrees with a cosecant law while for @xmath52 and , in particular , @xmath53@xmath54 , a clear departure sets in . up to @xmath55 ,",
    "the free - free emission contribution at 2.3 ghz is negligible with respect to the total emission which , consequently , is dominated by synchrotron radiation .",
    "we make use of the giardino et al .",
    "( 2002 ) spectral index map to extrapolate the 2.3 ghz data to 2.7 ghz .",
    "details on the giardino et al .",
    "map will be given in sect .",
    "we only emphasize that , although this is generally known to be a pure synchrotron spectral index map , no actual decomposition of the thermal and non - thermal emission has been performed in the original data . however , we have shown that up to @xmath56ghz , the observed emission is basically synchrotron radiation for @xmath57 .",
    "after convolving the 2.7 ghz data at the 2.3 ghz resolution , a latitude profile extending out to @xmath55 is obtained by averaging the total brightness temperature , corrected for the cmb , over the longitude range 20@xmath27 to 30@xmath27 .",
    "the zero level at 2.7 ghz is estimated at @xmath55 by extrapolating the 2.3 ghz data in frequency ( see fig .  3 , top panel ) .",
    "the best estimate of t@xmath58k which is slightly larger than the zero level uncertainty of 0.1 k given by reich et al .",
    "( 1990b ) .",
    "the estimate of the zero level for the parkes 6-cm survey is more complicated .",
    "the observed region does not extend beyond @xmath59=1.5@xmath27 . at these low latitudes ,",
    "the h@xmath16 can not be used to trace the free - free emission . moreover ,",
    "the thermal fraction is expected to represent a significant part of the emission .",
    "we then proceed along these lines .",
    "we first notice that , as reported by broadbent et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , the digitized version of the map has a constant offset added of 1 k. we subtract this offset from the data .",
    "we then consider the region @xmath60 to 10@xmath27 , @xmath61 in which the number of bad ( = empty ) pixels is negligible , even at the scan borders . as reported by haynes et al .",
    "( 1978 ) , out of 150 blocks in which the whole surveyed area has been divided , only 3 show baseline discrepancies and , in this case , a baseline adjustment to bring these blocks into line has been performed .",
    "this means that we can evaluate the absolute zero level in the region @xmath62 and confidently adopt such an estimate in the region @xmath1 .",
    "for @xmath60 to 10@xmath27 , @xmath63 1.5@xmath27 , we fit the spectral indices between 408 mhz and 2.3 ghz .",
    "we use these spectral indices to extrapolate the 2.3 ghz data to 5 ghz .",
    "this operation may formally introduce an error .",
    "however , given the fact that we extrapolate out of the fitting interval but to a nearby frequency , we can assume such an error to be small .",
    "the 5 ghz data , convolved to the larger 2.3 ghz beam , are used to derive a latitude profile extending up to @xmath64 .",
    "the zero level is obtained by comparison , at @xmath65 , with the expected profile from the extrapolated 2.3 ghz data ( fig .  3 , bottom panel ) .",
    "the best estimate , @xmath66k , is comparable to the uncertainty of 0.2 k quoted by haynes et al .",
    "( 1978 ) .",
    "having set and removed the zero levels at each considered frequency , we can perform the component separation . at a given frequency @xmath39",
    ", the brightness temperature @xmath41 of a single pixel can be written as :    @xmath67    where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the free - free and synchrotron emission contributions . by exploiting the information on the frequency dependence of each component",
    ", we have :    @xmath70    in these expressions , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are , respectively , the galactic , free - free and synchrotron spectral indices . the validity of eq .",
    "( 2 ) together with eqs .  ( 3 ) to ( 5 ) lies in the fact that , although the sum of two power - laws is not a power - law , it can always be fitted with a power - law when only two frequencies are considered . therefore , by combining eqs .",
    "( 3 ) through ( 5 ) , it is possible to derive the fraction of thermal emission at each frequency . with some algebra ,",
    "we obtain :    @xmath74    we have set @xmath75 , while for @xmath73 we built a map of spectral indices as described in the following section .",
    "@xmath71 is computed by fitting the values of @xmath76 with @xmath39 respectively @xmath77 , 2.7 and 5 ghz .",
    "one of the major problems in performing a careful separation between the free - free and the synchrotron emission is the spatial variation of the synchrotron spectral index . in order to take this variation into account",
    ", we use the spectral index map obtained by giardino et al .",
    "this map is constructed by combining data at 408 mhz , 1.4 and 2.3 ghz and has been convolved to a final resolution of @xmath78 in order to remove the striation due to the scan - to - scan baseline errors in the input data .",
    "the initial maps have also been median filtered with a a box of kernel of 9@xmath799 pixels ( given a pixel size of @xmath35 13@xmath18 ) to suppress the point source signal .    as discussed in sect .  3 , the giardino et al .",
    "map is not really a full - sky synchrotron spectral index template .",
    "however , for latitudes above 3@xmath80 , it can be regarded as a very good approximation to that . below these latitudes ,",
    "given the difficulty in obtaining an independent estimate of the free - free emission , it is not possible to have direct information on the synchrotron . at the same time , we do not expect a significant gradient in the synchrotron spectral index distribution within a few degrees from the plane .",
    "for this reason , we built a template of spectral indices for the selected region of the sky in the following way : we assume a spectral index between @xmath50 = -1.5@xmath27 to + 1.5@xmath27 similar to that between @xmath59 = 4@xmath27 to 5.5@xmath27 for our selected region @xmath81 = 20@xmath27 to 30@xmath27 .",
    "the spectral index between @xmath59 = 4@xmath27 to 5.5@xmath27 is that given by giardino et al .",
    "the average spectral index is @xmath82 .",
    "this is somewhat steeper than the typical spectral index of supernova remnants ( srns ) , @xmath83 ( green 2004 ) , which contribute significantly to the synchrotron emission on the plane .",
    "however , we note that @xmath84 of the cataloged snrs lie between @xmath59=4@xmath27 to 10@xmath27 ( green 2004 ) so that their effect is only partly neglected by our analysis . at the same time , a real steepening of the spectral index is expected above @xmath35 1 kpc from the plane ( lisenfeld @xmath8 vlk 2000 ) . for a snr at @xmath85 kpc , we are still within this range at @xmath86 . given these combined effects , our approach appears as a viable approximation of the actual distribution of spectral indices .    before illustrating the results of the application of eq .",
    "( 6 ) , we discuss the validity of eq .",
    "( 4 ) with the assumption @xmath87 over the range 1.4 ghz  5 ghz .",
    "an important point of the analysis is the assessment of the emitting conditions of the ionized gas in the frequency range we are considering and , in particular , at 1.4 ghz .",
    "the expression for the optical thickness @xmath88 of thermal bremsstrahlung in the altenhoff et al . ( 1960 ) approximation is , in cgs units :    @xmath89    if we assume the typical value @xmath90 k which is common to both the diffuse ionized gas and hii regions , we see clearly that @xmath88 is proportional to the emission measure ( em ) .",
    "the em is known to vary widely according to the form of ionized gas we are considering , i.e. diffuse gas or discrete , compact sources . for the diffuse gas , we use the reference value reported by reynolds ( 1983 ) of em @xmath91 9  23 @xmath92pc . for this , at 1.4 ghz we obtain from eq .  ( 7 ) @xmath93  5.@xmath94 and the optical thin regime applies . alternatively ,",
    "if we assume all the 5 ghz emission on the galactic ridge to be free - free emission , then the upper limit to @xmath95 is @xmath96 15 k , i.e. @xmath97 for @xmath98 = 8000 k. as for hii regions , of the 102 compact sources lying in our selected coordinate range ( see sect .  5 )",

    "most of the sources are characterized by an emission measure em @xmath35 @xmath99 to @xmath100@xmath92pc and only 20 percent have higher values , @xmath101@xmath92pc . in the em range @xmath102 @xmath103 pc , @xmath88 varies in the range @xmath104  0.2 at 1.4 ghz .",
    "again , since @xmath105 1 , the assumption @xmath106=-2.1 is correct .",
    "( 7 ) indicates that , at 1.4 ghz , @xmath88 is bigger than unity for values of the emission measure @xmath107pc .",
    "these values of em tend to characterize mainly uchii whose flux density at these frequencies is rather faint . in summary , our adopted free - free emission spectral index appears to be correct over the frequency range 1.4 ghz  5 ghz and the error introduced in the analysis by neglecting",
    "the presence of uchii in our region of the sky is small .      before we can make the separation between free - free and synchrotron emission using the formalism of eqs .",
    "( 3 ) to ( 6 ) , we compute , for each pixel in the selected coordinate range , the average spectral index , @xmath71 , in the frequency range 1.4 , 2.7 and 5 ghz . the distribution of @xmath71 between 1.4 and 5 ghz for the selected area is shown in fig .",
    "the average value is @xmath108 . the latitude variation in @xmath71 is shown in fig .  6 : there is a marked flattening of the spectral index on the galactic plane towards the free - free emission value of @xmath5 ( with a maximum value of @xmath109 ) demonstrating the dominance of free - free emission there",
    "at a galactic latitude of @xmath110 however the synchrotron fraction is significantly larger with a value of @xmath111 .    by applying eq .",

    "the variation of @xmath112 and @xmath113 with latitude is shown in fig .",
    "the thermal fraction of the total emission clearly increases on moving towards the plane reaching a maximum value of 82% at @xmath114 at 5 ghz ; the corresponding value at 1.4 ghz is 68% .",

    "we present evidence that , on a 9.4@xmath18 angular scale , the free - free emission fraction is contributed by both diffuse gas and discrete hii regions . in fact , a comparison of the latitude extension of the total free - free emission distribution with the latitude distribution of cataloged compact and ultracompact hii regions lying in the selected coordinate range indicates the presence of a dominant diffuse component at 5 ghz .",
    "cataloged hii regions contribute only @xmath35 9@xmath7 of the total emission budget .",
    "although this is only a lower limit since the catalogs are confusion limited at rather bright fluxes , it is likely that a large fraction of the the remaining emission is accounted for by diffuse gas .",

    ", we point out that the correlation amoung neighbourig pixels does not undermine our results : despite the fact that the oversampling and convolution which have been performed on the original data sets introduce a level of correlation of order of 1@xmath7 , given that all the operations involved are linear ( e.g. averages in longitude ) , this effect can be neglected . + a complementary approach to obtaining",
