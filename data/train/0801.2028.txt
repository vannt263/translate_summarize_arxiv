    "rare decays of mesons serve as the low - energy test of the standard model .",
    "accuracy of experiments has increased significantly in recent years .",
    "theoretically , the main limitation comes from the large distance contributions of the strong sector of the standard model where the perturbative theory does not work .",
    "however , in some important cases the result can be essentially improved by relating these poorly known contributions to other experimentally known processes .",
    "the famous example is the standard model calculation of the anomalous magnetic moment of muon @xmath4 where the data of the processes @xmath5 and @xmath6 are essential to reduce the uncertainty .",
    "it turns out that this is also the case for the rare neutral pion decay into an electron - positron pair measured recently by the ktev collaboration @xcite and reconsidered theoretically in @xcite .",
    "the measured branching is @xcite@xmath7 where the kinematic cut over the dalitz variable @xmath8 @xmath9 , was used in order to suppress the dalitz decay events @xmath10 .",
    "then , the important step in extraction of the branching consists in correct treating the radiative corrections ( rc ) to the process which has been considered earlier in @xcite and @xcite . extrapolating the full radiative tail beyond @xmath11 and scaling the result back up by the overall rc leads to the final result @xcite @xmath12 where the leading order radiative corrections have been taken into account @xcite .",
    "it is the motivation of our paper to revise the calculation of qed rc to the @xmath13 decay width",

    "1a ) corresponding to the conversion of the pion through two virtual photons into an electron - positron pair .",
    "the normalized branching ratio is given by @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 @xmath19 and the reduced amplitude is @xmath20   \\left [   ( p_{-}-k)^{2}-m^{2}+i\\epsilon\\right ]   } f_{\\pi}(-k^{2},-(q - k)^{2}),\\label{rq}\\ ] ] with the pion transition form factor @xmath21 being normalized as @xmath22 . the imaginary part of @xmath23 can be found in a model independent way @xcite@xmath24 while the real part is reconstructed by using the dispersion approach up to a subtraction constant@xmath25   .\\label{rer}\\ ] ]    usually this constant , containing the nontrivial dynamics of the process , is calculated within different models describing the form factor @xmath26 @xcite .",

    "one has to note that the logarithmic dependence of the first term on @xmath28 is compensated by the scale dependence of the integrals in the brackets .",
    "the accuracy of these calculations are determined by omitted small power corrections of the order @xmath29 and @xmath30 in the r.h.s .",

    "this lower bound follows from the property : @xmath38 for @xmath39 .",
    "it considerably improves the so - called unitary bound obtained from the property @xmath40 .",
    "further restrictions follow from qcd and allow one to make a model independent prediction for the branching @xcite @xmath41 which is @xmath42 below the ktev result ( [ bktev ] ) .",
    "the main source of the error in ( [ bth ] ) is defined by indefiniteness in the knowledge of the pion form factor @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy between ( [ bth ] ) and ( [ bktev ] ) requires further attention from experiment and theory to this process because there are not many places where experiment is in conflict with the standard model .",
    "considering the higher orders of qed  pt , there are two sources of rc to the width of the @xmath35 decay ( fig .",
    "1 ) . one of them has a renormalization group origin and can be associated with the final state interaction of electron and positron .",
    "the relevant contribution corresponds to taking into account the charged particle interaction at large distances .",
    "the other is of double - logarithmic character and is related to short distance contributions .",
    "let us note that the branching ratio ( [ bpi ] ) is proportional to the electron mass squared and thus the kinoshita  lee - nauenberg theorem of cancellation of mass singularities in the limit @xmath43 is not violated .",
    "the first kind of corrections was considered in @xcite .",
    "later , the effect of the higher order rc was estimated in @xcite by using the exponentiation of soft photon contributions , which is essentially equivalent to the yennie , frautchi - suura factorization procedure . considering only the two - virtual - photon conversion to a lepton pair",
    ", it is originated from the box type feynman amplitude ( fig .",
    "1e ) as well as the contribution from the emission of real photons by leptons ( fig .",
    "2 ) and produces the single - logarithmic enhanced terms ( @xmath44 ) which are described by the lepton nonsinglet structure function method @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the soft photon emission can drastically change the results obtained at the born level when the invariant mass of leptons is close to the pion mass .",
    "furthermore , we find an additional source of rc which is of the so - called `` double - logarithmic '' ( dl ) nature @xmath45 .",
    "this kind of asymptotics was intensively investigated in the 70s in a series of qed  processes @xcite . the dl type contribution to the decay width",

    "one can distinguish two mechanisms of the radiative decay @xmath89 .",
    "one of them , the so - called dalitz process , corresponds to decay mode of the pion to real and virtual photons with a subsequent decay of the virtual photon to the @xmath90 pair .",

    "this results in a negligible ( of order @xmath95 ) interference contribution integrated in the region of interest for this measurement , @xmath96 @xcite .",

    "it describes the probability for a fermion to stay a fermion . omitting the events with creation of more than one lepton , the nonsinglet structure function of electron relevant to the process valid at all orders in perturbation theory is - factor in ( [ f2 ] )",

    "the branching ratio of the pion decay into an electron - positron pair has been measured by the ktev collaboration in the restricted kinematic region in order to avoid a large background from the dalitz process dominating at lower values @xmath114 . by using the distribution ( [ f2 ] )",
    "we can estimate the factor of extrapolation of the full radiative tail beyond @xmath11 as @xmath115 . with this factor and scaling the result back up by the overall radiative correction ( [ radbs ] ) we confirm the result ( [ bktev ] ) obtained by the ktev collaboration .",
    "in this work , we reconsidered the contribution of qed radiative corrections to the @xmath35 decay which must be taken into account when comparing the theoretical prediction ( [ bth ] ) with experimental result ( [ bktevx ] ) . comparing with earlier calculations @xcite ,",
    "the main progress is in detailed consideration of the @xmath116 subprocess and revealing of dynamics of large and small distances .",

    "the double logarithmic contributions ( @xmath117 ) correspond to configurations when the particles in the loop are highly virtual .",
    "the total result is in reduction of the normalization factor by @xmath118 .",
    "occasionally , this number agrees well with the earlier prediction based on calculations @xcite and thus we confirm the ktev analysis of rc factors .",
    "so our main conclusion is that taking into account of radiative corrections is unable to reduce the discrepancy between the theoretical prediction for the decay rate ( [ bth ] ) and experimental result ( [ bktev ] ) .",
    "further independent experimental and theoretical efforts are necessary . note , that if the discrepancy will stand as it is , then the possible explanation of the effect is due the contribution to the decay width of low mass ( @xmath119 mev ) vector boson appearing in some models of dark matter @xcite .",
    "the question about the corrections is also important for the decays of @xmath120 and @xmath121 mesons to @xmath122 and must be taken into account for the analysis of experimental data .",
    "however , for these decays the large logarithm parameter does not arise .",
    "the analysis of the lowest order rc to the decay width of kaon to muon pair was given in @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the result of @xcite explicitly depends on infrared singularities and can not be used in practice .",
    "thus , in order to extract the information about @xmath123 decays ( where @xmath124 and @xmath125 ) calculated within the frame of definite models , the rc must be taken into account when working with experimental data , e.g. , for the process @xmath126 @xcite .",
    "for the process @xmath127 our results are applicable and we estimate rc  at the level @xmath3 .    finally , we have to emphasize that the role of rc is rather timely because of the growing accuracy of modern experiments .",
