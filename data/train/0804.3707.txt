    "in the popular scenario @xcite of spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry through a nonzero quark condensate in qcd vacuum the lightest pseudoscalar mesons @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the natural candidates for the goldstone bosons associated with the octet of quark currents with flavours .",
    "massless in the chiral limit , they acquire their observed masses as the light quarks @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are given small masses in the underlying qcd lagrangian .",
    "it is a moot question if a singlet @xmath0 as heavy as 1 gev should be identified as the goldstone boson for the singlet axial current @xmath7 .",
    "more challenging is the question whether the adler - bell - jackiw ( abj ) anomaly in the singlet current is an aberration that does not really destroy chiral symmetry , i.e. invariance under global chiral transformation , and hence the status of @xmath0 as the singlet goldstone boson but only fulfill the role of the missing element needed to explain its excess mass .",
    "all these issues constitute what is known as the @xmath8 problem .",
    "a turning point in the long tortuous history @xcite of @xmath8 problem is t hooft s @xcite observation that , though a total divergence , the abj anomaly can have nonzero space - time integral arising from instanton configurations of the gluon field and thus may induce large physical effects like the mass of @xmath0 .",
    "this essentially constituted the basis of the perception @xcite that chiral limit alone can not restore chiral symmetry and the status of goldstone boson for @xmath0 .",
    "one should , in addition , take recourse to the large @xmath1 ( number of colours ) limit in which quark loops necessary to generate abj anomaly are suppressed .",
    "the present revisit is inspired by the recognition that abj anomaly representing the topological charge density does not saturate the chiral limit of the divergence of the singlet axial current in an instanton background .",
    "the pseudoscalar mass term @xmath9 has nontrivial chiral limit arising from zero modes spawned in the fermion sector by instantons .",
    "these extra contributions are precisely what one needs to cancel , thanks to the atiah - singer index theorem , the topological charge contributed by abj anomaly to the chiral limit of the integral of the divergence of the singlet axial current . by ensuring invariance under ` rigid'(space - time independent ) chiral transformations in underlying qcd",
    ", this result opens a window for the restoration of the status of goldstone boson for singlet @xmath0 in the chiral limit without having to invoke the large @xmath1 limit .",
    "would it then be possible to interpret and understand the excess mass of @xmath0 through suitable terms @xcite in the effective lagrangian to represent the anomalous contributions of triangle diagram in the underlying qcd ?",
    "we wish to address these issues in the present revisit .",
    "for clarity of our discussion it is convenient to introduce pauli - villars fermions @xmath10 of mass @xmath11 to regularise quark loops . in path integral",
    "framework the jacobian for chiral transformation is trivial @xcite with this regularisation and the anomalous ward identity for the singlet axial current of quarks of @xmath12 flavours each with mass @xmath13 in the underlying qcd assumes the form @xmath14 with @xmath15 fermion averaging @xmath16 in ( [ dq ] ) is to be implemented in the orthonormal eigenbasis @xmath17 of the hermitian dirac operator @xmath18 @xmath19 one obtains @xcite @xmath20 nonzero eigenvalues @xmath21 have chiral partners @xmath22 belonging to the eigenmode @xmath23 .",
    "the zero eigenmodes @xmath24 however , have definite chirality with @xmath25 .    despite appearances , the chiral limit of the pseudoscalar mass term @xmath26 does not vanish and is instead composed of the zero modes    @xmath27    on the other hand , in the asymptotic @xmath28 limit of the pauli - villars term one recognises the exponent of the jacobian obtained by fujikawa @xcite for chiral transformation @xmath29 one",
    "is thus persuaded to rewrite eq.([anomaly ] ) as @xmath30[anomaly2 ] with @xmath31 to make the chiral limit transparent @xmath32 thus the total anomaly @xmath33 comprises two pieces @xcite of which the first is the familiar abj term eq.([adler ] ) and the other is the contributions from zero modes induced in the fermion sector by instantons . thanks to the atiyah - singer index theorem @xmath34 with winding number @xmath35 given by @xmath36 and @xmath37 the number zero modes of positive(negative ) chirality , the total integral of the divergence of the singlet axial current vanishes @xmath38 in the chiral limit .",
    "eq.([conservation ] ) signals chiral symmetry in the underlying qcd which played earlier @xcite a key role in demonstrating that in qcd a @xmath8 chiral phase in quark mass matrix is unphysical .",
    "this led to a resolution of the strong cp problem .",
    "the unphysicality of the @xmath8 chiral phase is obvious and transparent in the minkowski metric . a similarity transformation of the dirac matrices @xmath39 eliminates the @xmath8 chiral phase @xmath40 in quark masses in qcd lagrangian .",
    "it is important to recognise that the anomaly @xmath33 is nonlocal .",
    "this is not surprising .",
    "anomaly equations are not operator identities but are results of regularisation that emerge only after the regulators are removed . for the singlet axial anomaly",
    "@xmath33 the representation in eq.([chiraldef ] ) appears only when the ultraviolet regulator ( the pauli - villars mass @xmath11 ) and the infrared regulator ( the quark mass @xmath13 ) approach their appropriate limits in the right hand side of eq.([anomaly ] ) @xmath41 and fermion averaging @xmath42 is implemented in path integral framework . in the light of these observations",
    "one would believe that grafting anomaly equations into operator ward identities may not be quite warranted and may have sowed the seeds of controversies @xcite surrounding the @xmath8 problem .",
    "one obtains in path integral framework the correlator equation @xmath43 which follows from chiral symmetry , eq.([conservation ] ) , of the qcd action .",
    "this is the analog of the ward identity discussed in literature @xcite in the context of realisability of the singlet @xmath0 as a goldstone boson in the chiral limit .",
    "eq.([ward ] ) suggests the presence of a massless pseudoscalar particle if the quark condensate term @xmath44 is nonvanishing .",
    "this opens the window for restoring the status of goldstone boson for the singlet @xmath0 .",
    "the stage is thus set for addressing the problem of realising the excess mass of @xmath0 as and when one moves away from chiral limit by giving small masses to quarks .",
    "it is but natural to attribute the excess mass to contributions from a term in the effective lagrangian that represents the anomaly in the singlet axial current and yet obeys the constraint , eq.([conservation ] ) , in the chiral limit .",
    "according to eq.([conservation ] ) the global(rigid ) u(1 ) chiral symmetry is unaltered even when the divergence of axial vector current is anomalous . therefore , it is perfectly natural to regard the singlet pseudoscalar meson @xmath0 as a goldstone boson in the chiral limit ( i.e. when the quarks are massless ) just like its flavour counterparts .",
    "one can then include this ` ninth ' ( @xmath45th to be precise ) component in the chiral model  the effective low energy manifestation of qcd involving only the pseudoscalar fields and their currents .",
    "here the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry is realised through a nonlinear sigma model of matrix - valued fields associated with the flavour group @xmath46 .",
    "the leading term of the action @xmath47 describes the the dynamics of @xmath48 symmetry broken spontaneously to @xmath49 along with the conservation of @xmath45 axial vector currents @xmath50 .    the action in eq.([seed ] )",
    "is consistent with the global symmetries of massless qcd including the @xmath8 axial symmetry , but does not reflect the anomaly relation as given in eq.([anomaly3 ] ) for the colour gauge invariant singlet axial current .",
    "this lacuna can be cured by introducing the anomaly term in the lagrangian @xmath51 where for @xmath52 the natural ansatz @xcite is @xmath53 whose four divergence is the familiar abj term @xmath54    at first sight it may appear that the inclusion of eq.([anomalyterm ] ) in the effective lagrangian would yield only the abj term in the expression for the divergence of the singlet axial current contradicting eq.([conservation ] ) .",
    "this apparent discrepancy melts away if one recognises the nontrivial contribution from surface in the variation of the action under @xmath55 @xmath56    it should be observed that the representation eq.([anomalyterm ] ) for the anomaly term enjoys translation invariance @xmath57 , which , on the one hand reflects the chiral symmetry of the undelying qcd and on the other hand ensures that @xmath0 is massless in the chiral limit .",
    "in contrast , the alternative choice @xmath58 popular in literature @xcite reflects loss of both chiral symmetry and masslessness of @xmath0 .",
    "the contributions from the fermion zero modes @xcite which play the key role in realising chiral symmetry even in the presence of abj anomaly seem to have been ignored in literature .",
    "clearly the two terms @xmath58 and @xmath59 differ by a total derivative and hence by a surface term in the effective action .",
    "we shall see below that it is precisely this surface term that restores the goldstone boson status of @xmath0 .",
    "it is now obvious that @xmath60 is a very plausible candidate for a low energy effective action satisfying all the basic symmetries of qcd in the chiral limit . but this action results from integrating only the quark degrees of freedom and the gluons still survive in the form of color gauge non - invariant field @xmath52 .",
    "the final effective action must not involve these fields and hence they should be integrated out .",
    "the integration of quarks , in reality , would produce a nonlocal action that can be broken into an infinite number of local terms corresponding to various quark loops .",
    "but we have considered only those with minimum number of derivatives .",
    "similarly the @xmath52 integration would also make the theory non - local and we should filter out the minimal terms .          in the lowest iteration",
    "the contribution of the non - local action would look like @xmath61 with @xmath62 a priori there is no direct way of evaluating the propagator as we are in the low momentum transfer region of qcd .",
    "there are strong indications , however , that this propagator has a zero mass pole @xcite .",
    "it is connected to the fact that @xmath52 does not vanish at infinity since its surface integral is the topological charge .",
    "a zero mass pole would yield a local term proportional to @xmath63 from eq.([nonlocal ] ) @xcite and hence can be identified with a mass term .",
    "however , there will be non - local contribution coming from the surface and in the perturbative context is difficult to wirte in any closed form .    a more direct way to integrate out the gluonic components and estimate",
    "the surface term is to treat the field @xmath64 as a pseudo - gauge field which under color gauge transformation of gluons @xmath65 transforms as @xmath66 the lagrangian for @xmath52 can be written as @xcite @xmath67 \\label{klagrangian}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 is the gauge fixing parameter .",
    "the multiplicative factor @xmath69 in eq.([klagrangian ] ) , with @xmath70 a mass parameter ( closely related to the qcd mass scale ) has its origin from the susceptibilty caused by the vacuum polarization of @xmath12 species of constituent quarks in the yang - mills field background .",
    "the action involving the @xmath0 and @xmath52 fields and their interaction is quadratic and it should be possible to decouple them by a change of variable . to achieve this one has to express the local part of the action in terms of the derivatives of @xmath52",
    ". one , therefore , writes the interaction term eq.([anomalyterm ] ) as @xmath71 each term in the right hand side violates chiral symmetry even though the combination remains chiral invariant . the first term , being a total derivative , results in a surface term that does not vanish if @xmath0 is a massless goldstone boson . the second term , popular in literature @xcite for representing the anomaly in the effective lagrangian , breaks chiral symmetry explicitly .",
    "the surface term holds the key to the restoration of chiral symmetry .",
    "an essential ingredient for the nontriviality of the surface term is the existence of the zero mode of the @xmath0 goldstone boson .",
    "it is precisely this zero mode that acts as the generator of @xmath8 action on the vacuum to make it degenerate @xcite . on the surface at infinity",
    "only the zero mode ( a constant ) of @xmath0 survives and can be brought out of the integral yielding an action which is manifestly nonlocal @xmath72    to decouple the modes involving the rest of the action ( i.e. , the local part of the action of eq.([byparts ] ) along with the kinetic energy terms of @xmath0 and @xmath52 ) one just needs to change the functional integration measure from @xmath52 to @xmath73 with @xmath74 this yields the result for the local part of the action @xmath75 } \\label{action2 } \\end{array}\\ ] ] but for the zero mode ( eq.([surfaceterm ] ) ) @xmath0 is completely delinked from the pseudogauge field @xmath76 in the action . the apparent mass like term in the @xmath0 action is simply an artifact and the chiral symmetry broken by this is exactly compensated by corresponding chiral symmetry breaking term in the decoupled @xmath76 part of the action .    in reality the pseudoscalar goldstone particles are not massless .",
    "they acquire mass through explicit chiral symmetry breaking in lagrangian by quark mass @xmath77 where @xmath13 stands for the light quark mass matrix and @xmath78 is the condensate mass parameter @xcite .",
    "as soon as the _ small _ quark masses are switched on , the chiral symmetry is explicitly broken and @xmath0 along with its @xmath79 flavour counterparts acquires mass .",
    "this would automatically ensure that the pseudoscalar bosons die off at infinity and hence has no zero modes .",
    "thus the nonlocal part of the action eq.([surfaceterm])decouples from the theory and one is left with the a local action ( for the @xmath8 part ) @xmath80 } \\label{action3 } \\end{array}\\ ] ]    to summarise , the ansatz for the anomaly term eq.([anomalyterm ] ) reflects and implements the properties that characterise @xmath0 as the @xmath8 goldstone boson in the chiral limit and as a pseudo - goldstone boson away from it . in the chiral limit , global chiral @xmath8 symmetry guaranteed by eq.([conservation ] ) in the underlying qcd requires invariance under translation @xmath81 .",
    "this is realised in the ansatz eq.([anomalyterm ] ) , thus ensuring that @xmath0 remains massless in the chiral limit even in the presence of anomaly .",
    "away from the chiral limit , @xmath0 , along with its flavour counterparts , acquires small mass of order @xmath82 arising from the chiral symmetry breaking term eq.([quarkmass ] ) and the translation invariance ceases to be a symmetry in the goldsone boson sector .",
    "this is also reflected in the anomaly term written in the form eq.([byparts ] ) .",
    "the surface term drops out from the action of @xmath0 .",
    "all these properties are incorporated in the action @xmath83 of eq.([action3 ] ) .",
    "it also displays explicitly the piece in the @xmath0 mass that arises exclusively from the anomaly term eq.([anomalyterm ] ) . to obtain the total @xmath84",
    "one should , of course , add the piece arising from the explicit breaking of the chiral symmetry eq.([quarkmass ] ) that @xmath0 shares with its flavour counterparts .",
    "one thus recovers the witten - veneziano formula @xcite for the mass of @xmath0 @xmath85 note that the piece induced by anomaly in the @xmath0 mass , the second term of r.h.s of the eq.([massformula ] ) , is triggered only in the presence of the first term arising from explicit breaking of chiral symmetry through quark masses .",
    "the anomaly @xmath33 can not and does not yield , on its own , any mass .",
    "its role is that of a catalytic agent that enhances @xmath0 mass arising from explicit symmetry breaking terms in the action .",
    "thus unlike in the large @xmath1 scheme of refs .",
    "@xcite the singlet pseudo - golstone boson @xmath0 that emerges in the present scheme leads to the pcac relation @xmath86 ."
