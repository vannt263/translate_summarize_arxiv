    "the properties of many cerium or uranium compounds are well described by the kondo - lattice model , in which there is a strong competition between the kondo effect on each site and the ruderman - kittel - yosida - kasuya ( rkky ) interaction between magnetic atoms at different sites . on the other hand , it is now quite clear that the interplay between disorder and electronic correlations in these systems produces a new physics such as the presence of non - fermi liquid behaviour @xcite or percolative process in the magnetic states similar to manganites @xcite .",
    "an example of the percolative scenario can be found in @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this particular alloy presents a quite complex phase diagram as long as the doping of @xmath3 increases . in the range of doping @xmath4 ,",
    "the @xmath5sr results indicate formation of clusters below a characteristic temperature @xmath6 . on the other hand ,",
    "the ac - susceptibility ( @xmath7 ) shows the presence of a glassy ordering below a freezing temperature @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) . in this sense , this particular state can be caracterized as a cluster glass ( cg ) state .",
    "finally , it has been found an inhomogeneous ferromagnetic ( ifm ) order from neutron difraction at much lower temperature .",
    "however , there is no clear indication of a curie temperature @xmath10 from @xmath7 and @xmath11 measurements .",
    "therefore , it is possible to speculate that the evolution from cg state to the ifm order can be obtained by the percolation of the frozen clusters . one important experimental evidence supporting such scenario has been the behaviour of the hysteresis loops for @xmath12 at @xmath13 mk which display discrete jumps of the magnetization .    from the theoretical point of view , a model has been proposed to explain the presence of frustration in the global phase diagram of @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 .",
    "the model is a kondo lattice with an additional ising intersite interaction between localized spins called here kondo - ising lattice ( kil ) model @xcite .",
    "the important point is that disorder can be introduced in the kil model by choosing , for instance , the coupling @xmath14 between the localized spins as a gaussian random variable ( see for example , the sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) model @xcite ) . the results have shown that it is possible to construct a mean field solution of the kil model , where it is found a spin glass sg solution as well as a kondo regime @xcite .",
    "this approach has been extended to include a ferromagnetic ( fm ) solution @xcite by displacing the gaussian distribuition from the origin to @xmath15 .",
    "this procedure has allowed to introduce the usual magnetization as a new order parameter . as a result , a global phase diagram temperature _ versus _",
    "@xmath16 ( the strength of kondo coupling ) has been obtained displaying a sg phase , an additional fm one and a kondo regime .",
    "however , the sequence of phase transitions when the temperature is decreased ( for a constant @xmath16 ) is not in agreement to the experimental findings . on the contrary , the fm solution appears at higher temperature than the sg one .",
    "moreover , there is no percolation process .",
    "the results also show a conventional phase transitions in which there is , for instance , a clear curie temperature @xmath10 .",
    "it is also important to remark that the usual fm order parameter included in this particular approach is not able to capture the complexity of the experimental ifm ordering .",
    "recently , a new approach has been proposed replacing the random gaussian @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) for random site model in which @xmath17 , where @xmath18 are random variables which follow the distribution @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "in fact , this particular choice of @xmath14 can allow the interpolation from weak to strong frustration regimes .",
    "this model improves the previous sk - based model in two directions : first it gives a better possible description of the experimental ifm ordering and second it yelds a disordered ferromagnetic phase below the spin glass one in better agreement with the experiment .",
    "however , it is still necessary further theoretical improvements to describe the magnetic clusters in @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 .",
    "the presence of the cluster glass is a clear indicative that the frustration present in the intermediated doping of @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 can not be described by a conventional spin glass .",
    "one possible improvement to the original kil model would be to reformulate the intersite random interaction using cluster of spins instead of canonical spins .",
    "in fact , in a earlier work @xcite , the classical cluster glass problem has been studied in a mean field level .",
    "the model used is composed , basically , by a intracluster ferromagnetic coupling and a intercluster gaussian random coupling .",
    "this kind of approach seems adequate to be implemented to study the competition between kondo effect and cluster glass within the approach of ref .",
    "therefore , cluster of spins could be introduced in the original kil model @xcite by replacing the intersite random gaussian term by intracluster and intercluster terms similar to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to study competition between kondo effect and cluster glass . in view of the discussion in the previous paragraph , we use the following model ( called here kondo lattice cluster glass ( klcg ) ) to accomplish that study : @xmath20 where intercluster coupling @xmath21 is a random variable as the sherrington - kirkpatrick model @xmath22 with @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the number of cluster and the number of spin in each cluster , respectively .",
    "the hopping @xmath26 is only inside the cluster .",
    "the indices @xmath27 refer to clusters while @xmath28 indicates spins inside a cluster .",
    "so , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xmath32    the problem can be treated within the formalism of integral functional where the spin operators are given by bilinear combinations of grassmann fields .",
    "it should be remarked that disorder is introduced only in the intercluster random gaussian interaction @xmath21 .",
    "nonetheless , the thermodynamics for this particular situation is also obtained using the replica method .",
    "so , @xmath33    the procedure to deal with the disorder follows closely the the usual fermionic spin glass ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the problem is treated within the static approximation with order parameters @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) and @xmath36 being introduced by a hubbard - stratonovich transformation . then , replica symmetry is assumed @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the main difference is that , in the present approach , these order parameters describe a glassy ordering among cluster instead of canonical spins .",
    "the details of the calculations will be shown elsewhere @xcite .",
    "that is equivalent to diagonalize the following hamiltonian : @xmath41 \\\\ + & j_{k}\\sum_{i=1}^{n_{s}}\\left [ \\hat{s}_{i}^{\\dagger } s_{i}^{- } + \\hat{s}_{i}^{- } s_{i}^{+ } \\right ] -j_{0 } \\sum_{i < j}^{n_{s } } \\hat{s}_{i}^{z } \\hat{s}_{j}^{z } + 2h(p , q)\\sum_{j=1}^{n_{s } } \\hat{s_{j}^{z } } \\end{split } \\label{heff}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is given as @xmath43    then , in the effective problem , @xmath42 appears as a random external field applied in the cluster which depends on the clusters glass order parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , to obtain any information in this problem , it is necessary to diagonalize the hamiltonian @xmath46 given in eq .",
    "( [ heff ] ) and , simultaneously , to solve the saddle point equations for @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the behaviour of the cluster glass order parameters @xmath44 and the kondo correlation function @xmath47 are displayed in figs . 1 - 2 as a function of the kondo coupling @xmath16 for two values of temperature @xmath48 while the intracluster ferromagnetic coupling is kept constant @xmath49 ( @xmath50 is defined in eq . ( [ random ] ) ) .",
    "the size of the clusters also assumes two values , @xmath51 and @xmath52 . in fig .",
    "1 , the results for @xmath51 show that , when @xmath53 increases , the cluster glass order parameters @xmath44 decreases . for @xmath54 and @xmath55 , the cluster glass phase are destroyed for @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively . while @xmath44 decreases , @xmath47 enhances which means that the kondo effect inside the cluster becomes increasingly important . the combined behaviour of @xmath44 and @xmath47 would indicate that increase of the kondo effect inside the cluster is related to the destruction of the cluster glass phase . for @xmath58 ,",
    "the scenario described previously is preserved with @xmath44 decreasing and @xmath47 increasing .",
    "however , @xmath44 vanishes for larger values of @xmath16 as compared with the case @xmath51 , particularly , for @xmath55 .",
    "that result would suggest that the cluster glass phase becomes more robust with the increase of @xmath25    to conclude , in the present work we have studied the competition between cluster glass phase and kondo effect using the kondo lattice cluster glass model defined in eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) .",
    "the intercluster disorder problem is treated using the usual mean field procedure for fermionic spin glasses .",
    "therefore , the original problem is transformed in an effective one in which there is a random external field applied on the cluster .",
    "finally , it is used exactly diagonalization to solve the cluster .",
    "the results indicate that , when @xmath16 increases , the kondo correlation function @xmath47 also increases .",
    "simultaneously , the cluster glass phase is destroyed .",
    "these results suggest that this approach could be used to study the behaviour of the @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 .",
    "however , as discussed previously , the frustration in cited physical system can not be described in terms of a random gaussian coupling .",
    "it would be better described by a coupling used in ref .",
    "this approach is under current investigation .",
