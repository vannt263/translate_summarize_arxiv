    "while vega (= @xmath4  lyr = hr  7001 = hd  172167 = hip  91262 ; a0v ) plays an important role as the fundamental photometric standard , its photospheric chemical composition is known to be sort of anomalous .",
    "namely , most elements are mildly underabundant ( by @xmath5 dex on the average ) in spite of its definite population i nature , though the extent of deficiency is inconspicuous for several volatile elements of low condensation temperature ( @xmath6 ) such as c , n , o , and s. since this is the tendency more manifestly shown by a group of a ",
    "f main - sequence stars known as `` @xmath3  boo - type stars '' ( see , e.g. , paunzen 2004 and the references therein ) , vega s moderate abundance peculiarities have occasionally been argued in connection with this @xmath3  boo phenomenon ( e.g. , baschek & slettebak 1998 ; strenburg 1993 ; holweger & rentzsch - holm 1995 ; iliji et al . 1998 ) .    regarding the origin of unusual surface compositions of @xmath3  boo stars ,",
    "various models have been propounded so far , such as the diffusion / mass - loss model , accretion / diffusion model , or binary model ( see the references quoted in paunzen 2004 ) . among these , the interpretation that the anomaly was built - up by the accretion of interstellar gas ( where refractory metals of high @xmath6 are depleted because of being condensed into dust while volatile species of low @xmath6 hardly suffer this process ) , such as the interaction model between a star and the diffuse interstellar cloud proposed by kamp & paunzen ( 2002 ) , appears to be particularly promising , in view of paunzen et al.s ( 2002 ) recent finding that the [ na / h ] values of @xmath3 boo stars ( showing a large diversity ) are closely correlated with the [ na / h]@xmath7 values ( sodium abundance of interstellar matter ) in the surrounding environment ( cf .",
    "therein ) .",
    "then , according to the suspected connection between vega and @xmath3  boo stars , it is natural to examine the photospheric na abundance of vega .",
    "besides , the abundances of li and k may also be worth particular attention in a similar analogy , since these three alkali elements play significant roles in discussing the physical state of the cool interstellar gas through their interstellar absorption ( resonance ) lines of na  i 5889/5896 ( d@xmath8/d@xmath9 ) , li  i 6708 , and k  i 7665/7699 .    it is somewhat surprising , however , that reliable determinations of vega s na abundance are barely available . to our knowledge , although a number of abundance analyses of vega have been published so far over the past half century , na abundance derivations were done only in four studies ( among which original @xmath10 measurements were tried only two of these ) according to our literature survey : hunger ( 1955 ; na  i 5889/5896 ) , the reanalysis of hunger s @xmath10 data by strom , gingerich & strom ( 1966 ) , qiu et al .",
    "( 2001 ; na  i 5896 ) , and the reanalysis of qiu et al s @xmath10 data by saffe & levato ( 2004 ) .",
    "unfortunately , none of these appear to be sufficiently credible as viewed from the present knowledge , because of neglecting the non - lte effect for the strong resonance d@xmath8/d@xmath9 lines which were invoked in all these studies ( see below in this section ) .",
    "the situation is even worse for li and k , for which any determination of their abundances in vega has never been reported .",
    "gerbaldi , fraggiana & castelli ( 1995 ) once tried to measure the @xmath10(li  i 6708 ) value of vega and derived a tentative value of 2m@xmath11 , which was not used however , since they did not regard it as real under the estimated ambiguity of 4m@xmath11 ( cf .",
    "their table 6 ) . regarding the k  i 7665/7699 lines ,",
    "even a trial of measuring their strengths has never been undertaken for vega , as far as we know .",
    "several reasons may be enumerated concerning this evident scarcity of investigations on li , na , and k ( which actually holds for early - type stars in general ) : +  first of all , since the strengths of li  i , na  i , and k  i lines quickly fade out as @xmath12 becomes higher owing to the enhanced ionization of these alkali atoms ( only one valence electron being weakly bound ) , one has to contend with the difficult task of measuring very weak lines ( e.g. , @xmath10 value even as small as @xmath131m@xmath11 ) , which requires a spectrum of considerably high quality .",
    "+  second , these lines situate in the longer wavelength region of yellow  red to near - ir , where many telluric lines due to h@xmath9o or o@xmath9 generally exist to cause severe blending with stellar lines , which often prevent us from reliable measurements of equivalent widths . ( see ,",
    "e.g. , sect .",
    "6.2 of qiu et al .",
    "2001 , who remarked the large uncertainty caused by this effect in their measurements of na  i d lines ) .",
    "+  third , the resonance lines in the longer wavelength region are generally known to subject to considerable non - lte corrections especially for the case of na  i 5889/5896 lines showing considerable strengths . unfortunately , since detailed non - lte studies of these alkali elements have been rarely published as far as early - type ( a  f ) dwarfs are concerned , cma ( in addition to procyon and a  f supergiants ) , and andrievsky et al.s ( 2002 ) non - lte study of na  i d@xmath8 and d@xmath9 lines for late - b to early - f type dwarfs of @xmath3  boo candidates . ]",
    "lack of sufficient knowledge on non - lte corrections may have hampered investigating their abundances .",
    "given this situation , we decided to spectroscopically establish vega s photospheric abundances of li , na , and k scarcely investigated so far , while overcoming the problems mentioned above , in order to see how they are compared with the compositions of other elements in vega as well as with those of interstellar gas .",
    "this is the purpose of this study .",
    "this attempt was originally motivated by our recent work ( takeda , kawanomoto & ohishi 2007 ) of publishing a digital atlas of vega s high - resolution ( @xmath14 ) and high - s / n ( @xmath1310003000 ) spectrum along with that of regulus ( a rapid rotator to be used for a reference of contaminating telluric lines ) , by which the confronted main obstacles ( the necessity of measuring very weak lines as well as removing telluric blends ) may be adequately conquered . besides , regarding the technical side of abundance determinations , we are ready to evaluate not only the necessary non - lte corrections for li , na , and k ( according to our recent experiences of statistical equilibrium calculations on these elements for f  g ",
    "k stars ) , but also the gravity - darkening corrections which may be appreciable especially for very weak lines as revealed from our recent modeling of rapidly - rotating vega ( takeda , kawanomoto & ohishi 2008 ) .",
    "therefore , this would make a timely subject to address .",
    "the basic observational data of vega used for this study are the high - s / n ( @xmath13  10003000 ) and high resolution ( @xmath14 ) spectra , which are based on the data obtained with the high dispersion echelle spectrograph ( hides ) at the coud focus of the 188  cm reflector of okayama astrophysical observatory .",
    "these spectral data of vega , along with those of regulus ( a rapid rotator serving as a reference of telluric lines ) were already published as a digital atlas by takeda et al .",
    "/ dbc / adacnew / j / other / pasj/59.245/@xmath15 . ] which may be consulted for more details .",
    "the following 11 lines were selected as the target lines used for abundance determinations : na  i 5890/5896 , 8183/8195 , 6154/6161 , 5683/5688 , k  i 7665/7699 , and li  i 6708 ( cf .",
    "table 1 ) . since most of these wavelength regions ( except for those of na  i 6154/6161 and li  i 6708 ) are contaminated by telluric lines , these features were removed by dividing vega s spectra by the reference spectra of regulus ( with the help of iraf task telluric ) which are also included in takeda et al . ( 2007 ) along with the airmass information .",
    "though this removal process did not always work very successfully ( e.g. , for the case of very strong saturated lines such as the o@xmath9 in the k  i 7665/7699 region and the h@xmath9o lines in the na  i 8183/8195 region ) , we could manage to recover the intrinsic stellar lines more or less satisfactorily , since none of these target lines fortunately coincided with the deep core positions of such very strong telluric features .",
    "while most of the lines were confidently identified by comparing them with the theoretically simulated spectra , the detection of the extremely weak li  i 6708 line was still uncertain in the original spectrum even at its very high s / n ratio of @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , an extra smoothing was applied to the spectrum portion in the neighborhood of this line by taking a running mean over 9 pixels , by which the feature became more distinct ( cf . fig .",
    "6 ) thanks to the further improved s / n ratio by a factor of 3 .  10  km",

    "also , the use of `` relative correction '' ( instead of directly approaching the absolute abundance solution ) has a practical merit of circumventing the numerical - precision problem involved in the spectrum computation on the gravity - darkened model ( especially seen for the case of the extremely weak li  i 6708 line composed of several components ; cf .",

    "the results of the abundance analysis are given in column 7 ( lte abundance ; in the usual normalization of h=12.00 ) , column 8 ( non - lte correction ) , column 9 ( gravity - darkening correction ) , and column 10 ( non - lte as well as gravity - darkening corrected abundance ) .",
    "the finally adopted average abundance and the corresponding [ x / h ] value ( @xmath98 ) are also given at the bottom of the section ( in italics ; columns 10 and 11 ) , where grevesse & noels s ( 1993 ) values of 6.31 ( na ) , 3.31 ( li ) , and 5.13 ( k ) were used as the standard solar - system abundances ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "note that the analysis of @xmath10(lii  6708 ) was done by synthesizing the six component lines of @xmath100li ( neglecting the contribution of @xmath101li ; cf .",
    "takeda & kawanomoto 2005 ) , while all the remaining lines of na and k were analyzed by the single - line treatment as was done by takeda et al .",
    "( 2003 ; na ) and takeda et al .",
    "( 2002 ; k ) .",
    "the enhanced deficiency of li ( compared to na and k ) was an important key result in deriving the conclusion of this study ( cf .",
    "4.2 ) , since we interpreted it as a manifestation of ism compositions . in this connection",
    ", it may be worth mentioning another remarkable very sharp - lined a1  iv star , @xmath102  peg , for which we could also get information of the li abundance .",
    "as the only available measurement of the li  i 6708 line for early a - type stars thus far to our knowledge , coupry & burkhart ( 1992 ) derived @xmath10(6708 ) = 1.3  m@xmath11 for this star , which has atmospheric parameters ( @xmath12 = 9650  k , @xmath103 ) quite similar to those of vega except for its near - normal metallicity ( [ fe / h ] @xmath104 ; burkhart & coupry 1991 ) .",
    "now , their @xmath10(@xmath102  peg ) value twice as large as that of vega ( 0.7  m@xmath11 ) would raise the li abundance by + 0.3 dex . furthermore , since any flat - bottomed shape has never been reported in the spectral lines of @xmath102  peg ( as we can confirm from the high - quality spectrum atlas of this star published by gulliver , adelman , & friesen 2004 ) , the application of the gravity - darkening correction ( @xmath75dex for vega ) may not be relevant here , which again leads to an increase of 0.3dex .",
    "hence , we have [ li / h]@xmath105  [ li / h]@xmath77 + 0.6 ) @xmath106 ; an interesting result that the photospheric li abundance of @xmath102  peg almost coincides with that of the solar - system composition .",
    "this result , that [ li / h ] ( as well as [ fe / h ] ) is deficient / normal in vega/@xmath102  peg , may suggest that the mechanism responsible for producing the underabundance of these elements in vega is irrelevant for @xmath102  peg . thus , according to our interpretation , @xmath102  peg would not have suffered any pollution due to accretion of interstellar gas depleted in volatile elements of higher @xmath6 .    yet ,",
    "we had better keep in mind another possibility that the mechanism causing this li deficiency in vega might different from that of other metals . for example , this underabundance could be attributed to some process of envelope mixing ( e.g. , meridional circulation or shear - induced turbulence which are supposed to be more significant as a star rotates faster ) , because li atoms are burned and destroyed when they are conveyed into the hot stellar interior ( @xmath107k ) .",
    "namely , since we know that vega rotates rapidly ( as fast as @xmath108  km  s@xmath17 ) while @xmath102  peg does not so much ( at least the gravity - darkening effect is not so significant as in vega ) , the underabundance of li in the atmosphere of vega might stem from the rotation - induced mixing ( which is not expected for slowly rotating @xmath102  peg ) .",
    "if this is the case , however , the rough similarity in the extent of deficiency in li as well as other metals has to be regarded as a mere coincidence , which makes us feel this possibility as rather unlikely .",
    "our basic strategy for deriving the abundances of na , k , and li in sect .",
    "3 was as follows .",
    "+  ( 1 ) first , the @xmath24 was derived from @xmath33 based on the classical plane - parallel model atmosphere .",
    "+  ( 2 ) next , the non - lte correction ( @xmath25 ) was derived in the conventional way by using this classical model .",
    "+  ( 3 ) then , the gravity darkening correction ( @xmath26 ) was evaluated from the line - intensification factor @xmath109 ( where the abundance was so adjusted as to satisfy @xmath110 ) , which was computed by applying the calspec program ( takeda et al .",
    "2008 ) with the assumption of lte to the gravity - darkened model  4 and the rigid - rotation model  0 .",
    "+  ( 4 ) finally , @xmath27 was obtained as @xmath111 .",
    "actually , such a phased approach has a distinct merit of clarifying the importance / contribution of two different effects ( the non - lte effect and the gravity - darkening effect ) . besides",
    ", from a practical point of view , the necessary amount of calculations to arrive at the final abundance solution ( such that reproducing the observed spectrum ) can be considerably saved .",
    "however , there is some concern about whether such a step - by - step approach ( treating the two effects separately ) really yield sufficiently correct results , because both are actually related with each other ( e.g. , how does the largely variable non - lte corrections over the gravity - darkened stellar surface differing in @xmath53 or @xmath112 play roles ? how reliable is the gravity - darkening correction derived by neglecting the non - lte effect ? ) .",
    "therefore , it may be worth checking the validity of the finally derived abundances ( @xmath27 ) by carrying out a complete spectrum synthesis including both nlte and gd effects simultaneously .",
    "for this purpose , the calspec program was modified so as to allow inclusion of the non - lte departure coefficients ( corresponding to the different conditions at each of the points over the gravity - darkened stellar surface ) , and the nlte+gd profiles ( @xmath113 ) were computed for each of the 9 lines ( na  i 5890 , 5896 , 8183 , 8195 , 6154 , 6161 , 5683 , 5688 , k  i 7664 , 7699 , and li  i 6708 ) by using the already known @xmath27 values ( 6.03 , 6.01 , 5.82 , 6.01 , 6.13 , 6.12 , 5.97 , 5.99 , 4.82 , 5.01 , and 2.74 , respectively ) .",
    "such obtained @xmath113 profiles are depicted ( in thick solid lines ) in fig .",
    "9 , where the relevant three kinds of line profiles [ @xmath114 ( thick dashed line ) , @xmath115 ( thin solid line ) , and @xmath116 ( thin dashed line ) ] are also shown for comparison .",
    "values given in table 1 were assumed as the abundances for each of the lines .",
    "results for the gravity - darkened model and the classical rigid - rotation model ( model no . 4 and no . 0 in takeda et al .",
    "2008 ) are discriminated by the line type ( solid and dashed lines , respectively ) , and those for nlte and lte are by the line thickness ( thick and thin lines , respectively ) . as a result , four profiles are shown for each of the 9 lines : @xmath113 ( thick solid line ) @xmath114 ( thick dashed line ) , @xmath115 ( thin solid line ) , and @xmath116 ( thin dashed line ) . shown in the ordinate is the normalized flux divided by the theoretical ( pure ) continuum ; therefore , the local continuum level sometimes turns out to be slightly less than unity because of the extended wings of h lines .",
    "( note that the theoretical equivalent widths @xmath117 corresponding to @xmath113 profiles discussed in appendix b were calculated with respect to the local continuum , i.e. the maximum level in the neighborhood of the line profiles , irrespective of the scales in the ordinate . ) ( a ) na  i 5890 , ( b ) na  i 5896 , ( c ) na  i 8183 , ( d ) na  i 8195 , ( e ) na  i 6154 , ( f ) na  i 6161 , ( g ) na  i 5683 , ( h ) na  i 5688 , ( i ) k  i 7665 , ( j ) k  i 7699 , and ( k ) li  i 6708 . , width=302 ]    the resulting theoretical equivalent widths ( @xmath117 ) computed by integrating @xmath118 are 129.7 , 101.3 , 18.4 , 43.2 , 0.8 , 1.5 , 4.0 , 7.8 , 12.8 , 10.3 , and 0.4 m@xmath11 for these 9 lines , respectively . comparing these values with the observed equivalent widths ( @xmath33 ) given in table 1",
    ", we can see a satisfactory agreement between @xmath117 and @xmath33 ( typically to within several percent except for li  i 6708 = 0.4  m@xmath11 , while @xmath33 = 0.7  m@xmath11 ) .",
    "this must be due to the inevitable numerical errors in @xmath113 ( li  i 6708 ) computed by the calspec program ( synthesizing the flux spectrum by integrating the contributions from a number of finite surface elements ; each @xmath119 in latitude and longitude ) , which becomes appreciable especially for this case of li  i 6708 line involving synthesis of several component lines . as a matter of fact",
    ", we can see a spurious wavy pattern in the continuum level outside of this line ( see fig .",
    "b1k ) which indicates the existence of numerical problems ( even if small ) .",
    "it may be worth stressing that the gravity - darkening correction @xmath120 is not affected by this numerical error in @xmath121 because it is canceled by taking the ratio of @xmath121 . in this sense ,",
    "our semi - classical approach of establishing the final abundance ( application of two corrections to the classical lte abundance solution ; cf .",
    "3 ) is surely advantageous as far as this li  i 6708 line is concerned . ] ) , by which we may conclude that the approach adopted in sect .",
    "3 is practically validated ."
