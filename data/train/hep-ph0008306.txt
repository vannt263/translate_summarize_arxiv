    "since the end of the 1970 s , the spin structure of the nucleon has been studied by scattering polarized lepton beams off polarized targets .",
    "the aim of such experiments has been to measure the spin structure functions @xmath0 and @xmath1 , depending on the fractional momentum of the constituents , @xmath2 , and the square of four - momentum transfer , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the ( virtual ) photon lab energy and @xmath5 the nucleon mass .",
    "already the first experiments at cern  @xcite and slac  @xcite sparked considerable interest in the community , because the first moment of @xmath6 , @xmath7 , turned out to be substantially below the quark model prediction  @xcite .",
    "this `` spin crisis '' led to the conclusion that less than half of the nucleon spin is carried by the quarks .",
    "however , the difference of the proton and neutron moments , @xmath8 , was found to be well described by bjorken s sum rule  @xcite , which is a strict qcd prediction .    in spite of new and more sophisticated experiments  @xcite",
    ", the question about the carriers of the spin is still open .",
    "various new experimental proposals are presently underway at hermes , compass and jlab  @xcite , and in the context of the elfe project  @xcite .",
    "the idea behind these experiments is to measure the so - called skewed parton distributions , which are expected to reveal information on details of the parton structure , such as sea quark , gluon and orbital momentum contributions to the spin .",
    "the experimental tool to determine these new structure functions will be semi - inclusive reactions such as deeply virtual compton scattering and the production of various mesons as filters of particular quantum numbers  @xcite .",
    "recent improvements in polarized beam and target techniques have made it possible to determine the spin structure functions over an increased range of kinematical values .",
    "in particular the e143 collaboration at slac  @xcite and the hermes collaboration at desy  @xcite have obtained data at momentum transfers down to @xmath9 ( gev / c)@xmath10 .",
    "the range of momentum transfer below these values will be covered by various experiments at the jefferson lab , which are being performed in the full range @xmath11 ( gev / c)@xmath10  @xcite .",
    "the first direct experimental data for real photons @xmath12 were recently taken at mami  @xcite in the energy range 200  mev@xmath13  mev , and data at the higher energies are expected from elsa within short .    in conclusion we expect that the spin structure functions will soon be known over the full kinematical range",
    ". this will make it possible to study the transition from the non - perturbative region at low @xmath14 to the perturbative region at large @xmath14 .",
    "in particular the first moment @xmath15 is constrained , in the limit of @xmath16 ( real photons ) , by the famous gerasimov - drell - hearn sum rule ( gdh , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the anomalous magnetic moment of the nucleon .",
    "the reader should note that here and in the following we have included the inelastic contributions to @xmath15 only . as has been pointed out by ji and melnitchouk  @xcite ,",
    "the elastic contribution is in fact the dominant one at small @xmath14 and has to be taken into account in comparing with twist expansions about the deep inelastic limit .",
    "the gdh sum rule predicts @xmath19 for small @xmath14 , while all experiments for @xmath20  ( gev / c)@xmath21 yield clearly positive values for the proton .",
    "therefore , the spin structure has to change rapidly at low @xmath14 , with some zero - crossing at @xmath22  ( gev / c)@xmath21 . the expected strong variation of @xmath23 with momentum transfer marks the transition from the physics of resonance - driven coherent processes to incoherent scattering off the constituents .",
    "the evolution of the sum rule was first described by anselmino et al .",
    "@xcite in terms of a parametrization based on vector meson dominance .",
    "burkert , ioffe and others  @xcite refined this model considerably by treating the contributions of the resonances explicitly .",
    "soffer and teryaev  @xcite suggested that the rapid fluctuation of @xmath15 should be analyzed in conjunction with @xmath24 , the first moment of the second spin structure function .",
    "the latter is constrained by the less familiar burkhardt - cottingham sum rule ( bc , ref .",
    "@xcite ) at all values of @xmath14 .",
    "therefore the sum of the two moments , @xmath25 , is known for both @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "though this sum is related to the practically unknown longitudinal - transverse interference cross section @xmath28 and therefore not yet determined directly , ref .",
    "@xcite assumed that it can be extrapolated smoothly between the two limiting values of @xmath14 .",
    "the rapid fluctuation of @xmath15 then follows by subtraction of the bc value from @xmath29 .",
    "the small momentum evolution of a generalized gdh integral was investigated by bernard et al .",
    "@xcite in the framework of heavy baryon chpt . at @xmath30",
    "these authors predicted a positive slope of this integral at @xmath26 , while the phenomenological analysis of burkert et al .",
    "@xcite indicated a negative slope .",
    "these generalized gdh integrals contain information on both spin structure functions , which are combined such that the practically unknown longitudinal - transverse interference term cancels . as will be explained later in detail ,",
    "the definition of these integrals in the literature is not unique .",
    "recently , ji et al .",
    "@xcite have extended the calculations to @xmath31 .",
    "they find strong modifications due to the next - order term , which even change the sign of the slope at the origin to negative values much below the phenomenological analysis . in a similar way the related forward spin polarizability @xmath32",
    "is changed substantially by going from @xmath30 to @xmath33 , which may cast some doubt on the convergence of the perturbation series  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately there appears an additional problem concerning the decomposition of the compton amplitude in the nucleon pole terms ( contained in the real born amplitude ) and contributions of intermediate excited states ( the complex residual amplitude ) .",
    "the origin of the problem is due to the foldy - wouthuysen type expansion in hbchpt , which changes the pole structure at any given expansion in the nucleon mass @xmath5",
    ".    it will be the aim of this contribution to present our predictions for the helicity - dependent cross sections , and to compare our results with the existing data and other theoretical predictions .",
    "for this purpose we shall review the formalism in sect .  2 , with special emphasis on sum rules and generalized gdh integrals .",
    "our predictions will be compared to the data and previous calculations in sect .  3 , and we shall close by a brief summary of our results in sect .  4 .",

    "the negative bump due to s - wave pion production near threshold decreases rapidly with increasing values of @xmath135 due to the form factor . in the case of the @xmath119 ,",

    "due to the weighting factor @xmath116 , the threshold region below 200  mev contributes substantially , while the region above 800  mev is of little importance . in the case of @xmath117 , the integrand in the resonance region ( 200  mev@xmath156800  mev )",
    "has now been measured at mami  @xcite .",
    "the experimental value is ( -1.71@xmath1940.09 )  @xmath195  @xmath196 , slightly smaller than the prediction of maid , -1.66@xmath197  @xmath196 .",
    "we conclude that the presently best value of the forward spin polarizability is @xmath198@xmath196 .",
    "comparing now with the results of chpt at @xmath30 , we find the interesting relation @xmath199 , which can be explained as follows .",
    "the leading order term originates from the lower limit of the integrals in eqs .",
    "( [ eq19 ] ) and  ( [ eq20 ] ) if @xmath200 . in that limit the threshold amplitudes  @xcite for charged pion production are @xmath201 . by comparing eqs .",
    "( [ eq25 ] ) and  ( [ eq26 ] ) in the same limit , @xmath4 and @xmath202 , all higher partial waves vanish and we are left with integrands @xmath203 times @xmath204 and @xmath205 , respectively , which immediately leads to the mentioned relation . given the existing ambiguity in the definition of @xmath117 in hbchpt , it is probably not very useful to compare the phenomenological results with the predictions of chpt .",
    "a brief look at the last 4 lines of table  [ tab2 ] shows , however , that neither prediction can presently describe both @xmath117 and @xmath122 .",
    "it would therefore be interesting to examine whether the higher order terms in @xmath185 etc .",
    "could possibly also be affected by the ambiguities to separate elastic and inelastic contributions .    in table",
    "[ tab3 ] we compare our predictions for the slopes of the integrals of eqs .",
    "( [ eq9])-([eq13c ] ) with the predictions of chpt , the burkhardt - cottingham sum rule , and the models of anselmino et al . , and",
    "soffer and teryaev .",
    "we should point out that we have evaluated all predictions with the same set of coupling constants and masses as specified before .",
    "furthermore , we have used the more recent value @xmath206 for the asymptotic value  @xcite of the integral over the spin structure function @xmath59 , and the proton radii @xmath207  fm@xmath21 and @xmath209  fm@xmath21 as given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is obvious that the different approaches lead to rather different results .",
    "in particular , the generalized gdh integrals differ by factors and , with regard to chpt at @xmath210 , even by sign . in the case of @xmath211",
    "we can estimate the asymptotic contribution , which is missing in our analysis , from the hermes data  @xcite .",
    "if we add the slope of this contribution to our value , we obtain a further decrease by about @xmath212 , i.e. a final result of @xmath213  ( gev / c)@xmath214 , which is still different from chpt by a factor of 3 . as has been pointed out before , the @xmath30 calculation predicts @xmath215 and @xmath216 .",
    "if we use our model - independent eqs .",
    "( [ eq17 ] ) and  ( [ eq24 ] ) and the relation @xmath199 at @xmath30 , we find @xmath217 . in a similar way we have evaluated @xmath218  gev@xmath214 at @xmath33 from the results of ji et al .",
    "had we taken the value of @xmath117 from ref .",
    "@xcite , the result would be @xmath219  gev@xmath214 .",
    "as a consequence the ambiguity in the @xmath33 spin polarizabilities influences the predictions for the generalized gdh integrals and a solution of the problem is urgently called for .",
    "we recall that this problem arises from the difficulty to describe the proper pole structure for real and virtual compton scattering in higher order hbchpt , and repeat our suspicion that similar ambiguities could also arise in the case of the gdh integrals .",
    "we further note that our analysis does not support the conjecture of soffer and teryaev  @xcite that @xmath220 varies slowly with @xmath135 .",
    "these authors propose to parametrize @xmath221 for the proton by a smooth function interpolating between the given values for @xmath97 and @xmath222 ,    @xmath223    the continuity of the function and its derivative is implemented by choosing @xmath224  ( gev / c)@xmath21 .",
    "the resulting derivative at the origin is very small ,    @xmath225    and the derivative of @xmath82 follows from assuming the validity of the bc sum rule . in comparing our result with eq .",
    "( [ eq35 ] ) , we find that the slopes differ by about a factor of 20 .",
    "the model of anselmino et al .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , is relatively close to our prediction .",
    "motivated by the vector dominance model , these authors proposed to describe @xmath82 by the expression    @xmath226    with @xmath227 , the mass of the @xmath228 meson .",
    "the resulting derivative at the origin is    @xmath229    while our phenomenological model predicts 4.4  gev@xmath214 .",
    "the results of our phenomenological model maid have been presented for various spin observables .",
    "we have updated our prediction for the gdh sum rule for the proton and find a good agreement with the sum rule value .",
    "the change from earlier results originate from a collaborative effect of a correct treatment of the threshold region , a reduced estimate for the two - pion contributions based on the recent results of the gdh collaboration at mami , and an asymptotic contribution .",
    "we look forward to the continuation of the mami experiments to the higher energy at elsa , which will probe the weakest point of our prediction , the two - pion contribution in the resonance region . in the case of the neutron",
    "the disagreement remains , and we are urgently waiting for a direct measurement of the helicity - dependent neutron cross sections in the resonance region .",
    "the same model can be used to calculate the spin polarizability and an associated longitudinal - transverse polarizability . due to the weighting factor @xmath116 , these predictions are on rather firm ground .",
    "unfortunately , a comparison with the results from chpt is difficult , because their interpretation is still under discussion .",
    "we have also presented a systematic analysis of various generalized gdh - type integrals @xmath230 and of the bc sum rule @xmath231 . in the case of the proton",
    ", the latter can be reasonably well described by our model , but our prediction for the neutron fails again . though all generalized gdh integrals are fixed for both real photons , @xmath97 , and in the asymptotic region , @xmath232 , their dependence on momentum transfer differs considerably for @xmath233  ( gev / c)@xmath21 . a clear signature of these differences",
    "are the slopes @xmath234 at the origin .",
    "in particular we compare our predictions to those of other phenomenological models and heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory .",
    "the different slopes from different definitions of @xmath235 are related by model - independent relations involving the spin polarizability and related quantities , which can be safely evaluated from the helicity - dependent cross sections in the resonance region . since both the spin polarizability and",
    "the derivatives of the gdh integrals are derived from doubly virtual compton scattering in chiral perturbation theory , the ongoing discussion on how to separate pole and non - pole contributions in that theory also poses a serious problem for the generalized gdh integrals . as long as this problem exists , the given comparison between different predictions should not be taken too seriously .",
    "however the large spread of the obtained values certainly poses the challenge to solve the theoretical problem and to measure the generalized gdh integrals a soon as possible .",
    "since we expect a negative slope of the purely transverse gdh integrals with a minimum as low as @xmath236 , it is quite fortunate that some of the jlab experiments take data down to very low momentum transfer .",
    "we conclude that the presently running and newly proposed experiments with beam and target / recoil polarization will give invaluable information on the spin structure of the nucleon .",
    "it is to be hoped that this quantitative increase of our knowledge will also sharpen our theoretical tools to test the applicability and the predictions of qcd in the confinement region .",
    "the authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( sfb 443 ) and of the heisenberg - landau program .",
