    "quantum computers were offered by feynman @xcite and others and were formally described by deutsch @xcite . feynman and",
    "deutsch proposed a bold conjecture :    * * the postulate of quantum computation : * _ computational devices based on quantum mechanics will be computationally superior compared to digital computers .",
    "_    the idea was that since computations in quantum physics require an exponential number of steps on digital computers , computers based on quantum physics may outperform classical computers . a spectacular support for this idea came with peter shor s theorem @xcite that asserts that quantum computers can factor integers in polynomial time .",
    "it is not known if there is a classical algorithm to factor @xmath0-digit integers in polynomial time , and it is widely believed that this is impossible . moreover ,",
    "much of modern cryptography , as well as security in computer systems for finance and commerce are based on the assumption that factoring integers is computationally hard .",
    "the feasibility of computationally superior quantum computers is one of the most fascinating and clear - cut scientific problems of our time .",
    "the main concern regarding quantum - computer feasibility is that quantum systems are noisy . especially damaging",
    "is decoherence , which amounts to information leaks from a quantum system to its environment .    * * the postulate of noise : * _ quantum systems are inherently noisy . _",
    "the postulate of noise and the nature of decoherence are intimately related to questions about the nature and origins of probability , uncertainty , and approximations in physics .",
    "the concern regarding noise was put forward in the mid-90s by landauer @xcite , unruh @xcite , and others .",
    "the theory of quantum error correction and fault - tolerant quantum computation ( ftqc ) and , in particular , the _ threshold theorem _",
    "@xcite , which asserts that under certain conditions ftqc is possible , provide strong support for the possibility of building quantum computers .",
    "our next section [ s : bm ] describes the basic framework for quantum computers , noisy quantum computers , and the threshold theorem .",
    "the emerging theory of quantum fault tolerance gives hope for building quantum computers but at the same time raises some concern regarding the initial rationale of feynman .",
    "as far as we know , quantum error correction and quantum fault tolerance ( and the very highly entangled quantum states that enable them ) are not experienced in natural quantum processes . our understanding that computationally superior quantum computers depend on realizing quantum error correction codes , which are not witnessed in nature , weakens the initial rationale given for quantum computers .",
    "it is not clear if computationally superior quantum computation is necessary to describe natural quantum processes , or , in other words , if there are _ computational _ obstruction for simulating natural quantum processes on digital computers .    in this paper",
    "we address two closely related questions .",
    "the first is what kind of noise models cause quantum error correction and ftqc to fail .",
    "the second is what are the properties of quantum processes that do not exhibit quantum fault tolerance and how are such processes formally modeled .",
    "we discuss three related directions .",
    "the first deals with quantum codes , the second deals with correlation and entanglement of noisy stochastic physical systems , and the third deals with modeling noisy quantum evolutions when noise accumulates .",
    "quantum error correcting codes are at the heart of the issue .",
    "we will discuss them in section [ s : codes ] .",
    "the hope regarding ftqc is that no matter what the quantum computer computes or simulates , nearly all of the noise will be a mixture of states that are not codewords in the error correcting code , but which are correctable to states in the code .",
    "the concern regarding quantum codes is expressed by the following conjecture :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * conjecture 1 : * _ the process for creating a quantum error correcting code will necessarily lead to a mixture of the desired codeword with undesired codewords . _",

    "conjecture 1 proposes such a systematic relation .",
    "such a relation does not violate linearity of quantum mechanics , and it is expected to occur in processes that do not exhibit fault tolerance .",
    "let me give an example : suppose that we want to simulate on a noisy quantum computer a certain bosonic state .",
    "the standard view of noisy quantum computers asserts that this can be done up to some error that strongly depends on the computational basis .",
    "( the computational basis is a basis of the hilbert space based on the individual qubits . ) in contrast , we can regard the subspace of bosonic states as a quantum code , and the type of noise we expect amounts to having a mixed state between the intended bosonic state and other bosonic states .",
    "such a noise does not exhibit a strong dependence on the computational basis but rather it depends on the intrinsic properties of the simulated state .",
    "the feasibility of quantum computers is closely related to efficient versions of the church - turing thesis .",
    "this thesis originated in the works of church and turing in the mid-1930s is now commonly formulated as follows :    * * the church - turing thesis : * _ a turing machine can simulate any realistic model of computation .",
    "_    another formulation of the church - turing thesis ( following kamal jain ) which does not rely on the notion of a turing machine is simply : _ every realistic model of computation can be simulated on your laptop . _",
    "the church - turing thesis is closely related to a fundamental distinction between computable and uncomputable functions , a distinction which is the basis of the theory of computability . another major distinction , between tasks that can _ efficiently _ be solved by computers and tasks that can not , is the basis of computational complexity theory .",
    "the most famous conjecture in this theory asserts that non - deterministic polynomial time computation defines a strictly larger class of decision problems than polynomial - time computation , or , briefly , @xmath1 .",
    "itamar pitowsky was one of the pioneers to study the connections between the church - turing thesis and physics , and to consider efficient versions of the thesis .",
    "the various possible versions of the efficient church - turing thesis touch on several fundamental problems regarding the physical origin of probability , classic and quantum .",
    "we will discuss the church - turing thesis and its efficient versions in section [ cth ] .",
    "our second direction is described in section [ s : dn ] .",
    "we propose and discuss two postulates on the nature of errors in highly correlated noisy physical stochastic systems .",
    "the first postulate asserts that errors for a pair of substantially correlated elements are themselves substantially correlated .",
    "the second postulate asserts that in a noisy system with many highly correlated elements there will be a strong effect of error synchronization .",
    "the basic idea is that noisy highly correlated data can not be stored or manipulated . on a heuristic level",
    "this conjecture is interesting for both the quantum and the classical cases . in order to put these conjectures on formal grounds we found it necessary to restrict them to the quantum case and refer to decoherence , namely the information loss of quantum systems .",
    "we indicate how to put our conjectures regarding entanglement and correlated noise on formal mathematical grounds .",
    "details can be found in @xcite .    in section [ s : np ]",
    "we discuss quantum evolutions that allow noise to accumulate .",
    "this is our third direction .",
    "here again we assume no structure on the hilbert space of states .",
    "the class of noisy quantum processes we describe is an interesting _ subclass _ of the class of all noisy quantum processes described by time - dependent lindblad equations .",
    "the model is based on the standard time - dependent lindblad equation with a certain additional `` smoothing '' in time . in section [ s : ph ] we discuss some physical aspects of our conjectures . in section [ s : ita ] i describe several places where itamar pitowsky s academic journey interlaced with mine going back to our days as students in the 1970s .",
    "this section provides background on the models of quantum computers and noisy quantum computers .",
    "we assume the standard model of quantum computer based on qubits and gates with pure - state evolution .",
    "the state of a single qubit @xmath2 is described by a unit vector @xmath3 in a two - dimensional complex space @xmath4 .",
    "( the symbols @xmath5 and @xmath6 can be thought of as representing two elements of a basis in @xmath7 . )",
    "we can think of the qubit @xmath2 as representing @xmath8 with probability @xmath9 and @xmath10 with probability @xmath11 .",
    "the state of a quantum computer with @xmath0 qubits is a unit vector in a complex hilbert space @xmath12 : the @xmath13-dimensional tensor product of two - dimensional complex vector spaces for the individual qubits .",
    "the state of the computer thus represents a probability distribution on the @xmath13 strings of length @xmath0 of zeros and ones .",
    "the evolution of the quantum computer is via `` gates . ''",
    "each gate @xmath14 operates on @xmath15 qubits , and we can assume @xmath16 .",
    "every such gate represents a unitary operator on the ( @xmath17-dimensional ) tensor product of the spaces that correspond to these @xmath15 qubits . at every `` cycle time '' a large number of gates acting on disjoint sets of qubits operates .",
    "we will assume that measurement of qubits that amount to a sampling of 0 - 1 strings according to the distribution that these qubits represent is the final step of the computation .",
    "the basic locality conditions for noisy quantum computers assert that the way in which the state of the computer changes between computer steps is approximately statistically independent for different qubits . we will refer to such changes as `` storage errors '' or `` qubit errors . ''",
    "in addition , the gates that carry the computation itself are imperfect .",
    "we can suppose that every such gate involves a small number of qubits and that the gate s imperfection can take an arbitrary form , and hence the errors ( referred to as `` gate errors '' ) created on the few qubits involved in a gate can be statistically dependent .",
    "we will denote as `` fresh errors '' the storage errors and gate errors in one computer cycle .",
    "of course , qubit errors and gate errors propagate along the computation .",
    "the `` overall error '' describing the gap between the intended state of the computer and its noisy state takes into account also the cumulated effect of errors from earlier computer cycles .",
    "the basic picture we have of a noisy computer is that at any time during the computation we can approximate the state of each qubit only up to some small error term @xmath18 .",
    "nevertheless , under the assumptions concerning the errors mentioned above , computation is possible .",
    "the noisy physical qubits allow the introduction of logical `` protected '' qubits that are essentially noiseless .",
    "we will consider the same model of quantum computers with more general notions of errors .",
    "we will study more general models for the fresh errors .",
    "( we will not distinguish between gate errors and storage errors , the two different components of fresh errors . )",
    "our models require that the storage errors should not be statistically independent ( on the contrary , they should be very dependent ) or that the gate errors should not be restricted to the qubits involved in the gates and that they should be of sufficiently general form .",
    "we will not specify the noise at each computer cycle but rather consider a large set , referred to as the _ noise envelope _ , of quantum operations the noise can be selected from .",
    "let @xmath19 be the following envelope of noise operations for the fresh errors : the envelope for storage errors @xmath20 will consist of quantum operations that have a tensor product structure over the individual qubits .",
    "the envelope for gate errors @xmath21 will consist of quantum operations that have a tensor product structure over all the gates involved in a single computer cycle ( more precisely , over the hilbert spaces representing the qubits in the gates ) . for a specific gate",
    "the noise can be an arbitrary quantum operation on the space representing the qubits involved in the gate .",
    "( the threshold theorem concerns a specific universal set of gates @xmath22 that is different in different versions of the theorem . )",
    "[ threshold theorem ] @xcite consider quantum circuits with a universal set of gates @xmath22 .",
    "a noisy quantum circuit with a set of gates @xmath22 and noise envelopes @xmath20 and @xmath21 is capable of effectively simulating an arbitrary noiseless quantum circuit , provided that the error rate for every computer cycle is below a certain threshold @xmath23 .",
    "the threshold theorem , which was proved by three independent groups of researchers , is a major scientific achievement .",
    "the proof relies on the notion of quantum error correcting codes and some important constructions for such codes , and it requires further deep and difficult ideas .",
    "the value of the threshold in original proofs of the threshold theorem was around @xmath24 and it has since been improved by at least one order of magnitude .",
    "numerical simulations based on new fault tolerance schemes ( @xcite ) suggest that the value of @xmath25 can be raised to 3% .",
    "a quantum code is a very fundamental object .",
    "a code is simply a subspace @xmath26 of the hilbert space @xmath12 describing the states of a quantum system .",
    "states in @xmath26 are called `` codewords . ''",
    "note that this description does not refer to any additional structure of the underlying hilbert space but in order to talk about errors and error - correction we need to restrict our attention to hilbert spaces that have tensor product structure . for",
    "that we first talk about classical error - correcting code .",
    "the construction of ( classical ) error - correcting codes is among the most celebrated applications of mathematics .",
    "error - correcting codes are eminent in today s technology from satellite communications to computer memories .",
    "a binary code @xmath27 is simply a set of 0 - 1 vectors of length @xmath0 .",
    "recall that the hamming distance between two such vectors @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the number of coordinates @xmath28 and @xmath29 differs .",
    "the minimal distance @xmath30 of a code @xmath27 is the minimal hamming distance between two distinct elements @xmath31 .",
    "the same definition applies when the set @xmath32 is replaced by a larger alphabet @xmath33 . when the minimal distance is @xmath34 the code @xmath27 is capable of correcting @xmath35 $ ] arbitrary errors .",
    "consider the @xmath13-dimensional hilbert space @xmath12 describing the states of a quantum computer with @xmath0 qubits .",
    "the tensor product structure of @xmath12 enables us to talk about error - correction capabilities of the quantum code @xmath26 .",
    "the first known example of a quantum error - correcting code by shor @xcite and steane @xcite was on seven qubits .",
    "it was capable to correct arbitrary single - qubit errors .",
    "the hope regarding ftqc is that no matter what the quantum computer computes or simulates , nearly all of the noise will be a mixture of states that are not codewords in the error - correcting code , but which are correctable to states in the code .",
    "in contrast we made the following conjecture :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * conjecture 1 : * _ the process for creating a quantum error correcting code will necessarily lead to a mixture of the desired codeword with undesired codewords .",

    "it is especially appealing if the process for creating the quantum code does not involve fault tolerance .",
    "the motivation behind this conjecture is simple .",
    "the process for creating an error - correcting code can be seen as implementing a function @xmath36 .",
    "( typically , @xmath0 is larger than @xmath15 . )",
    "the function @xmath37 encodes @xmath15 qubits ( or @xmath15 bits in the classical case ) using @xmath0 qubits .",
    "a noisy vector of inputs will lead to a mixture of the target codewords with undesired codewords .",
    "here is an example : _",
    "kitaev s toric code _ is a remarkable quantum error - correcting code @xcite described by a vector space @xmath26 of states of qubits placed on the vertices of an @xmath0 by @xmath0 lattice on a two - dimensional torus .",
    "the toric code encodes a pair of qubits .",
    "kitaev s toric codes can be regarded as a quantum analog of a one - dimensional ising model .",
    "if we use a toric code for quantum computation , the hope supported by the standard noise model , is that during the computation we will have a mixed state that can be correctable ( except for an exponentially small probability ) to a unique codeword .",
    "conjecture 1 implies that we can only achieve mixed states that can be correctable to a ( non - atomic ) probability distribution of codewords .",
    "a way to describe these different views is to associate to a noisy toric state seven real parameters .",
    "one parameter represents the distance to the hilbert space of toric states , and six parameters represent the encoded two qubits",
    ". a noisy state in the conventional picture will amount to having the first parameter described by a certain probability distribution and the other six parameters by a delta function !",
    "quantum fault tolerance will enable the creation of such states .",
    "in contrast , conjecture 1 asserts that a noisy toric code state will be described by a probability distribution supported on a full seven - dimensional set in terms of these seven parameters .",
    "classical error - correcting codes are _ not _ special cases of quantum codes and conjecture 1 does not apply to them .",
    "nevertheless it is interesting to ask to what extent conjecture 1 is consistent with classical computation .",
    "a convenient and fairly realistic way to think about classical computation is by regarding the computer bits as representing a low - temperature ising model on a large number of particles .",
    "each particle has an up spin or a down spin and the interactions force the entire system to be in one of two states . in one of these states",
    "every particle is , with a high probability , an up spin , and in the other state every particle is , with a high probability , a down spin .",
    "one way to think about the ising model is as follows .",
    "the ising state represents the probability for an up spin .",
    "this is a sort of classical analog to a quantum code : for every real parameter @xmath38 the `` codewords '' representing @xmath38 are configurations where a fraction of @xmath38 particles have up spins .",
    "the classical computer is built from ising - model - based bits .",
    "each bit thus represents a probability distribution .",
    "the gates allow us to `` measure '' this probability distribution and create according to the values for one or two bits new such bits representing the basic boolean operation .",
    "note that in this probabilistic description we have storage and gate noise that is compatible with ( a classical version of ) conjecture 1 .",
    "nevertheless , this allows noiseless classical computation .",
    "the church - turing thesis asserting that `` everything computable is computable by a turing machine , '' and its sharper forms about efficient computation , can be regarded as laws of physics .",
    "however , there is no strong connections between the thesis and computability in general and theoretical physics . when it comes to the original form of the church - turing thesis ( namely when efficiency of computation is not an issue )",
    ", it does not seem to matter if you allow quantum mechanics or work just within classical mechanics .",
    "however , for a model of computation based on physics it is important to specify what are the available approximations or , in other words , the ways in which errors are modeled .",
    "( failure to do so may lead even to `` devices '' capable of solving undecidable problems . )",
    "there are various proposed derivation of the church - turing thesis from physics laws . on the other hand , there are various `` hypothetical physical worlds '' that are in some tension with the church - turing thesis ( but whether they contradict it is by itself an interesting philosophical question ) . a paper by pitowsky @xcite deals with such hypothetical physical worlds .",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "_ efficient computation _ refers to a computation that requires a polynomial number of steps in terms of the size of the input .",
    "the efficient church - turing thesis , first stated , as far as i know , by wolfram @xcite in the 80s , reads :    * * classical efficient church - turing thesis : * _ a turing machine can efficiently simulate any realistic model of computation . _",
    "one of the most important developments in computational complexity in the last four decades is the introduction of randomized algorithms .",
    "randomized algorithms use some internal randomization and it is quite surprising that this allows for better algorithms for various computational tasks .",
    "this leads to    * * probabilistic efficient church - turing thesis : * _ a probabilistic turing machine can efficiently simulate any realistic model of computation .",
    "_    the postulate of quantum computation is in conflict with these versions of the efficient church - turing thesis .",
    "the analogous conjecture for quantum computers is    * * quantum efficient church - turing thesis : * _ a quantum turing machine can efficiently simulate any realistic model of computation . _",
    "one aspect of the efficient church - turing thesis ( again , both in its classical , probabilistic , and quantum versions ) is that it appears to imply that np - complete problems can not be computed efficiently by any computational device .",
    "this again is a physics conjecture of a sort ( and it depends , of course , on mathematical conjectures from computational complexity ) .",
    "there are some interesting attempts to relate the impossibility of solving np - complete problems to physics , but still the interaction with theoretical physics is rather slight .",
    "another interesting aspect of ( both classic and quantum versions of ) the efficient church - turing thesis is the implication that physical models that require infeasible computations are unrealistic .",
    "it is an interesting question in the context of model - building .",
    "should we take computational complexity into consideration in scientific modeling ?",
    "can a model that is not efficiently computable , or not computable at all , still be useful ?",
    "what then is the correct description of the computational power supported by our physical reality ?",
    "when it comes to randomization there is strong support to the assertion that weak sources of randomness can replace perfect random sources .",
    "there is some support to the stronger assertion that randomization is not really required and can be replaced by deterministic processes called _",
    "pseudorandom generators_. of course , even if randomness does not genuinely enhance the computational power , which is a common belief among experts , randomized algorithms yield important heuristic ways to design powerful algorithms .",
    "indeed , the use of randomness is quite substantial even in algorithmic processes in nature .",
    "when it comes to quantum algorithms , there is strong supporting evidence to the assertion that quantum computers are computationally superior compared to classical ones .",
    "therefore , the feasibility of quantum computers is strongly related to the correct model of computation for our physical world .",
    "the threshold theorem asserts that noisy quantum computers where the noise level is sufficiently low , and the noise satisfies some natural assumptions , have the full computational power of quantum computers ( without noise ) .",
    "we end this section with a question relating the interpretation of probability to computation .",
    "one of the approaches to the foundations of probability , classical and quantum alike , regards the world as deterministic and probability as expressing only human uncertainty .",
    "we can ask , if any probability in nature ( be it classic or quantum ) only expresses human uncertainty , how can using probability genuinely enhance the computational power ?",
    "the purpose of this section is to propose and discuss the following postulate :    * _ any noisy physical system , is subject to noise in which the errors for a pair of elements that are substantially statistically dependent are themselves substantially statistically dependent . _",
    "another way to put postulate [ p1 ] is : noisy correlated elements can not be approximated up to almost independent error terms : if we can not have an approximation better than a certain error rate for each of two correlated elements , then an uncorrelated or almost uncorrelated approximation is likewise impossible .",

    "this is the kind of approximation required for fault - tolerant quantum computation .",

    "* the threshold theorem and pair purification . *",
    "the threshold theorem that allows ftqc has various remarkable applications , but conjecture 2 can be regarded as challenging its simplest consequence .",
    "the assumptions of the threshold theorem allow the errors on a pair of qubits involved in a gate to be statistically dependent .",
    "in other words , the outcome of a gate acting on a pair of qubits prescribes the position of the two qubits only up to an error that is allowed to exhibit an arbitrary form of correlation .",
    "the process of fault tolerance allows us to reach pairs of entangled qubits that , while still being noisy , have errors that are almost independent .",
    "note that fault tolerance does not improve the `` quality '' of individual qubits , and fault - tolerant computation allows computation in noisy computers where at any point the state of an individual qubit can only be estimated up to a certain small error .",
    "* we do not propose that the entanglement of the pair of noisy qubits _ causes _ the dependence between their errors .",
    "the correlation between errors can be caused , for example , by the process leading to the entanglement between the qubits , or simply by the ability of the device to achieve strong forms of correlation .",
    "suppose we have an error rate of @xmath18 .",
    "the assumptions of the various threshold theorems ( and other proposed methods for quantum fault tolerance ) imply that the probability of a proportion of @xmath44 qubits being `` hit '' is exponentially small ( in the number of bits / qubits ) when @xmath44 exceeds @xmath18 .",
    "error synchronization refers to an opposite scenario : there will be a substantial probability of a large fraction of qubits being hit .",

    "is referred to @xcite . the best way we found for expressing formally correlation between information leaks ( conjecture 2 ) and error synchronization ( conjecture 3 ) is via the expansion of quantum operations representing the noise in terms of multi - pauli operations .",
    "the basic measure of entanglement for a pair of qubits in joint pure state is in terms of the von neumann entropy .",
    "it is useful to consider _ emergent entanglement _ which is the maximum expected entanglement for two qubits after we separably measure ( and look at the outcome of ) the remaining qubits of the computer .",
    "we can define the notion of highly entangled state in terms of emergent entanglement , and if we strengthen conjecture 2 to deal with a pair of qubits with high emergent entanglement then we can prove that this already implies conjecture 3 ; see @xcite .",
    "it is an interesting question to identify quantum codes for which conjecture 1 implies error synchronization .",
    "a main property of ftqc is that it enables us to suppress noise propagation : the effect of the noise at a certain computer cycle diminishes almost completely already after a constant number of computer cycles . in this section",

    "we now turn our attention to some physical aspects of the conjectures .",
    "one place to examine some suggestions of this paper is current implementations of ion - trap computers . in these implementations",
    "we need to move qubits together in order to gate them , and this may suggest that , in each computer cycle , an additional noise where errors are correlated for _ all _ pairs of qubits is in place .",
    "this is an example where properties of accumulated noise may occur for other reasons .",
    "let us go back to the example of simulating bosonic states with a noisy quantum computer . here",
    "the code is the hilbert space of bosonic states and conjecture 1 asserts that part of the noise is a mix of the intended bosonic state with other unintended bosonic states .",
    "this is different from local noise which depend on the computational bases .",
    "noise accumulation seems consistent with the familiar property of physical systems where the low - scale structure is not witnessed when we look at larger scales .",
    "we do not yet have quantum computers that simulate bosonic states but we do have several natural and experimental processes that come close to this description , like phonons , which can be regarded as a bosonic state ( on a macroscopic scale ) `` simulated '' on microscopic `` qudits . ''",
    "another relevant example is that of bose - einstein condensation on cold atoms .",
    "describing the bosonic state in terms of individual atoms is analogous to describing a complicated state of a quantum computer in terms of the computational basis .",
    "this analogy enables us to ask if the deviation of a state created experimentally from a pure state can be described by independent noise operators on the different atoms .",
    "conjecture 1 proposes a different picture , namely , that a state created experimentally can be described as a mixture of different pure bose - einstein states .",
    "these examples can serve as a good place to examine noise .",
    "several people have commented that our suggested properties of noise for some ( hypothetical ) quantum computer architecture at some quantum state @xmath64 allow instantaneous signaling , and thus violate basic physical principles .",
    "this is perfectly correct , but our proposed conclusion is that this quantum computer architecture simply does not accommodate the quantum state @xmath64 .",
    "( see figure 3 . )    finally , an important proposal for implementing quantum computation is via topological quantum computing .",
    "topological quantum computing is based on a remarkable class of quantum codes that represent certain representations of the braid group .",
    "the traditional bosons and fermions can be replaced by objects called _",
    "anyons_. the extreme stability to noise expected for anyonic systems relies on similar assumptions to those enabling quantum error correction .",
    "conjecture 1 has a direct bearing on anyons , and the case for conjecture 1 is especially strong for anyons because the proposed experimental processes for creating them do not exhibit quantum fault tolerance .",
    "our conjecture asserts that when we experimentally create anyons we will witness a mixture of the intended state with other states of the same type and we will not witness the strong stability of certain anyonic systems that is predicted by current models .",
    "this paper is devoted to the memory of itamar pitowsky .",
    "itamar was a great guy ; he was great in science and great in the humanities",
    ". he could think and work like a mathematician , and like a physicist , and like a philosopher , and like a philosopher of science , and probably in various additional ways . and",
    "he enjoyed the academic business greatly , and took it seriously , with humor .",
    "itamar had an immense human wisdom and a modest , level - headed way of expressing it .",
    "itamar s scientific way and mine interlaced in many ways , a few of which are related to this paper .",
    "itamar s approach to the foundation of quantum mechanics was that quantum mechanics is a theory of non - commutative probability which ( like classical probability ) can be seen as a mathematical language for the other laws of physics .",
    "( this paper , to a large extent , adopts this point of view .",
    "but , frankly , i do not quite understand the other points of view . ) in the late 70s when itamar and i were both graduate students i remember him telling me enthusiastically about his thoughts on the erds - turan problem .",
    "this is a mathematical conjecture that asserts that if we have a sequence of integers @xmath65 such that the infinite series @xmath66 diverges then we can find among the elements of the sequence an arithmetic progression of length @xmath15 , for every @xmath15 .",
    "( it is still unknown even for @xmath67 . ) over the years both of us spent some time on this conjecture without much to show for it .",
    "some years later both itamar and i got interested , for entirely different reasons , in remarkable geometric objects called cut polytopes .",
    "cut polytopes are obtained by taking the convex hull of characteristic vectors of edges in all cuts of a graph .",
    "cut polytopes arise naturally when you try to understand correlations in probability theory and itamar wrote several seminal papers in their study ; see @xcite .",
    "cut polytopes came to play , in an unexpected way , in the work of jeff kahn and myself where we disproved borsuk s conjecture @xcite . over the years , itamar and i got interested in arrow s impossibility theorem @xcite which itamar regarded as a major 20th - century intellectual achievement .",
    "he gave a course centered around this theorem and years later so did i. we were both members of the center for the study of rationality at the hebrew university and we both participated in a recent interesting debate regarding installing a camera in the center s kitchenette which turned out to raise interesting questions regarding privacy , shaming , and cleanliness , @xcite .",
    "the role of skepticism in science and how ( and if ) skepticism should be practiced is a fascinating issue .",
    "it is , of course , related to this paper which describes skepticism over quantum fault tolerance , widely believed to be possible .",
    "( i also believe it might be possible , but i think we should explore how it can be impossible . ) itamar and i had long discussions about skepticism in science , and about the nature and practice of scientific debates .",
    "a few years ago itamar gave a lecture about physicists feeling after the standard model was found that a complete understanding of the fundamental laws of physics is around the corner .",
    "this feeling was manifested , according to itamar , in weinberg s wonderful book _ the first three minutes : a modern view of the origin of the universe_. itamar described some later developments in physics that , to some extent , shattered this euphoric feeling .",
    "later , following his visit to the perimeter institute and a conversation he had with lee smolin , itamar told me about the skeptical blogs and books about string theory .",
    "i got interested and eventually wrote an adventure book @xcite criticizing the skeptical approach of the `` string war '' skeptics .",
    "much earlier , in the early 90s , we had several conversation regarding the `` bible code '' research .",
    "three researchers wrote a paper that showed statistical evidence for hidden codes in the bible .",
    "neither itamar nor i believed this claim for a minute but it certainly led to interesting issues regarding statistics , philosophy of science , scientific ethics , and more .",
    "itamar was convinced that science can cope with such claims and saw no harm in them being published .",
    "some years later , i was part of a team that offered @xcite statistical biased selection as a much simpler and more familiar explanation for the outcomes of this research .    a week before itamar passed away , itamar , oron shagrir , and i sat at our little cs cafeteria and talked about probability . where does probability come from ?",
    "what does probability mean ?",
    "does it just represent human uncertainty ?",
    "is it just an emerging mathematical concept that is convenient for modeling ? do matters change when we move from classical to quantum mechanics ?",
    "when we move to quantum physics the notion of probability itself changes for sure , but is there a change in the interpretation of what probability is ? a few people passed by and listened , and it felt like this was a direct continuation of conversations we had had while we ( itamar and i ; oron is much younger ) were students in the early 70s .",
