    "in the conventional wisdom , the smallness of the neutrino masses is tied to the high scale of the new physics that generates neutrino masses . as this scale is very close to the grand unification ( gut ) scale ,",
    "it is generally not possible to directly test the model . in view of the recent commissioning of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) ,",
    "it is interesting to ask whether or not the neutrino mass generation can be due to new physics at the tev scale so that one may probe the origin of neutrino mass generation at the collider experiments .    in this review ,",
    "we discuss various tev scale mechanisms for neutrino mass generation . these include various seesaw mechanisms ( type - i , ii , iii ) based on different uv completions of the weinberg operator , radiative neutrino mass generation , mssm with r - parity violation , models with expanded gauge symmetries including guts , tev scale extra dimensions , or higher dimensional operator approach .",
    "each of these scenarios provides distinct signatures that can be looked for at the collider experiments or in low energy lepton flavor violation searches .",
    "the review is organized as follows . in section [ sec : models ] , we review various tev scale mechanisms for neutrino mass generation . in section [ sec : leptg ] , we comment on leptogenesis in the presence of a low seesaw scale . section [ sec : example ] shows an explicit model based on tev scale @xmath0 family symmetry and its predictions for the lhc .",
    "this is followed by section [ sec : sparticle ] where the implications of the @xmath0 family symmetry for the sparticle spectrum are discussed .",
    "section [ sec : cond ] concludes the review .",
    "the mechanisms to lower the seesaw scale can be classified into the following classes according to their ultra - violet ( uv ) completion .",
    "if the effective neutrino masses are generated at dim-5 , from naive dimensional analysis , the yukawa coupling constants must be on the order of @xmath1 , to have the cutoff scale to be at the tev scale . as a result ,",
    "generically the seesaw sector is decoupled from the collider experiments , unless the production mechanism for the new particles that participate in the seesaw mechanism is independent of the small yukawa couplings or small heavy - light mixing .",
    "this generally requires the existence of exotic states other than the right - handed neutrinos , or new interactions which right - handed neutrinos participate in .",
    "there are three uv completions of weinberg operator , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , which correspond to type - i , ii , iii .",
    "different type of seesaw mechanisms may be distinguished by multi - lepton signals at the collider experiments@xcite .",
    "general discussions on collider searches for heavy majorana neutrinos can be found in ref .  .",
    "in type - i seesaw mechanism , the field that uv completes the weinberg operator is the right - handed neutrino .",
    "the only way to test seesaw mechanism is to produce the right - handed neutrinos .",
    "the effective light neutrino mass matrix , @xmath2 , is related to the rh majorana mass matrix , @xmath3 and the dirac mass matrix , @xmath4 , as @xmath5 .",
    "given that the yukawa coupling constants are small @xmath6 , the production of rh neutrinos through the yukawa interactions is negligible .",
    "in the presence of the mixing between light and heavy neutrinos , it is also possible to produce the rh neutrinos through the gauge interactions .",
    "nevertheless , the production is suppressed by the small mixing , @xmath7 while in order to have observable effects it generally requires@xcite , @xmath8 ( note that the constraints from the universality of the weak interactions and z - width require @xmath9 can still be satisfied . ) as a result , the physics responsible for neutrino mass generation is decoupled from the collider physics .    to avoid having un - naturally small yukawa couplings while retaining the rh neutrino mass scale in the tev regime , one may have the scenario in which at the leading order the effective neutrino mass matrix leads to three massless neutrinos .",
    "this can happen if and only if the dirac neutrino mass matrix has rank one in the rh neutrino mass basis and that the contributions to the effective masses due to coupling to the three rh neutrinos add up to zero@xcite . in this case",
    ", the yukawa coupling constants can be arbitrarily large while having the rh neutrino mass scale at a tev .",
    "such cancellation may arise due to the presence of an underlying family symmetry , _",
    "e.g. _ a discrete subgroup of the @xmath10 symmetry@xcite , the @xmath11 symmetry@xcite , or the @xmath12 symmetry@xcite .",
    "while at the leading order the seesaw mechanism predicts massless neutrinos , neutrinos acquire their masses through some other mechanisms .",
    "the collider signatures for lepton number violation include , @xmath13 at the leading order , since neutrino masses are protected by a symmetry , the cross sections for these processes vanish .",
    "neutrino masses are generated by some small perturbations . due to the fact that these must be small perturbations to the leading order result ,",
    "the effects of lepton number violation are highly suppressed unless there is extreme fine - tuning@xcite .      in type - ii seesaw mechanism@xcite ,",
    "the weinberg operator is generated by the t - channel exchange of a @xmath14 triplet higgs , @xmath15 , with hypercharge @xmath16 .",
    "the effective neutrino mass in this case is given by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the yukawa coupling constant .",
    "upon the triplet acquiring a vev , @xmath19 the neutrinos obtain effective masses given by @xmath20 .",
    "the parameter @xmath21 is the custodial symmetry breaking coupling in the scalar potential , @xmath22 .",
    "given that the vev @xmath23 must be small enough to give sufficient suppression to the effective neutrino masses , the precision ew constraint@xcite from the @xmath24 parameter can be satisfied .",
    "to have the mass scale of the triplet higgs at a tev requires @xmath25 . if one allows the coupling constants to be as small as the electron yukawa coupling , then @xmath26 . upon the electroweak symmetry breaking taking place , there exist seven massive physical higgs bosons : two neutral higgses , @xmath27 , one cp odd higgs , @xmath28 , two singlet charged higgses , @xmath29 , and two doubly charged higgses , @xmath30 .",
    "the generic prediction of the model is the existence of the doubly charged higgses , which couple only to the leptons , but not to the quarks .",
    "a unique signature of this class of model is that the doubly charged higgses decay into same sign di - leptons ( for a recent general discussion on the same sign dilepton signals at the collider experiments , see , ref .  ) , @xmath31 which do not have any sm or mssm backgrounds . as pointed out in ref .  ,",
    "the doubly charged higgses can be produced at the lhc via the drell - yan , @xmath32 as the production of the triplet higgs is through the gauge interactions , it is independent of the small light - heavy neutrino mixing and consequently can have unsuppressed production cross section , in contrast to the case of the type - i seesaw .",
    "it has been shown that , for a triplet mass in the range of ( 200 - 1000 ) gev , the cross section can be 0.1 - 100 fb . with 300 fb@xmath33 , a doubly charged higgs , @xmath34 , with mass of 600 gev can be discovered at the lhc .",
    "phenomenology associated with the triplet higgs at a linear collider has also been investigated@xcite .",
    "the weinberg operator can also be uv completed by the mediation of a @xmath14 triplet fermion , @xmath35 , with zero hypercharge@xcite .",
    "the effective neutrino mass is @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the dirac yukawa coupling of the triplet lepton to the sm lepton doublet and the higgs and @xmath38 is the lepton number violation scale . to have @xmath39 tev , @xmath37 has a value @xmath6 .    because the triplet lepton @xmath40 has weak gauge interactions , their production cross section is unsuppressed , contrary to the case of the type - i seesaw",

    "implications for neutrinoless double beta decay have been investigated in ref .  .",
    "the smallness of the neutrino masses can also be explained if the neutrino masses are generated radiatively@xcite .",

    "it is also possible for the light neutrino masses to arise only at the higher loop levels with tev scale rh neutrinos@xcite . given that the new particles introduced in these tev scale models differ model by model , the collider signatures@xcite are quite model dependent .",

    "in addition , to simultaneously obtain the mild neutrino mass hierarchy and two large and one small mixing leptonic mixing angles generally requires severe fine - tuning in the 5d yukawa coupling constants .",

    "the fcnc constraints can be satisfied by attributing the flavor mixing to the up - type quark and neutrino sectors , while having flavor diagonal down - type quark and charged lepton sectors , given that the down - type quark and charged lepton sectors are most stringently constrained by the measurement of @xmath92 and @xmath93 mixing in the quark sector , and in the lepton sector from the non - observation of @xmath50 conversion as well as the lfv charged lepton decays .      in mssm with three right - handed neutrinos , the superpotential for the yukawa sector and higgs sector that gives masses to all sm fermions and higgs fields is given as follows , @xmath94 in the presence of the @xmath0 symmetry , the yukawa matrices in the superpotential shown above are the effective yukawa couplings generated through higher dimensional operators _  la _ the froggatt - nielsen mechanism . as a result , they can be written as powers of the ratio of the flavon fields , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , that breaks the @xmath0 symmetry , to the cutoff scale of the @xmath0 symmetry , @xmath38 , @xmath97 the chiral superfield @xmath98 is a sm gauge singlet whose @xmath0 charge is normalized to @xmath99 .",

    "the sm backgrounds , which are almost identical for both channels at the tree level since the gauge couplings of @xmath152 and @xmath153 to the sm fermions are universal , are highly suppressed in the @xmath81 resonance region , allowing a clear distinction between the signals from the backgrounds .",
    "a @xmath154 discovery of the @xmath81 at the lhc entails @xmath155 , with @xmath52 being the number of @xmath81 signal events that satisfies @xmath156 , @xmath157 being the number of sm drell - yan background events , @xmath158 and @xmath159 respectively being the total cross sections of the signal and background events , and @xmath160 being the integrated luminosity . with @xmath161 fb@xmath162 of data",
    ", the lhc can discover a @xmath81 with a mass up to 4.5 tev at the center of mass energy @xmath163 tev .      while there is a great potential for the @xmath81 discovery at the lhc during its early low luminosity running , to establish the flavorful nature of the @xmath81 , after it has been discovered in the dilepton channels , requires a significant larger amount of data .",
    "the flavorful nature of the @xmath81 can be established in the model by measuring the ratio of the decay branching fractions and forward - backward asymmetry . in the @xmath164 model ,",
    "the electron and muon are allowed to have different @xmath164 charges , the ratio of the decay branching fractions , @xmath165 can in general differ from @xmath166 .",
    "the ratio @xmath167 is given as , @xmath168 if the @xmath81 is also discovered in the @xmath169 channel , by measuring both @xmath167 and the ratio of the decay branching fractions of @xmath149 to @xmath169 channels , @xmath170 and we can uniquely determine the parameter @xmath171 , as demonstrated in fig .  [ fig : brratio ] and further determine the neutrino mixing angle .",
    "the bench mark point , @xmath172 and @xmath173 , predicts a ratio of the branching fractions of @xmath174 . to study the integrated luminosity required for distinguishing the @xmath149 and @xmath150 channels at @xmath154 using the counting method , we define the following variable , @xmath175 where @xmath176 and @xmath177 are the cross sections of the @xmath178 and @xmath21 events .",
    "the parameter @xmath179 thus gives the difference in the numbers of events between @xmath136 and @xmath137 . if @xmath180 , the difference between the dielectron and dimuon events is above @xmath181 significance . at @xmath163 tev with @xmath182 fb@xmath162 of data , a statistically significant distinction between the branching fractions for @xmath178 and @xmath21 channels can be obtained up to @xmath183 tev .",
    "additionally , forward - backward asymmetry @xmath184 can also be used to distinguish various flavor @xmath0 models .",
    "it is defined as , @xmath185 where @xmath186 are the total cross sections of the forward and backward events , respectively . by using the forward backward asymmetry distributions , a clear distinction between the dielectron and dimuon channels",
    "can be obtained in the low invariant mass and low transverse momentum regions with 500 fb@xmath162 data .",
    "this is shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : afb1 ]    [ fig : afb2 ]",
    "in addition to giving rise to realistic masses and mixing angles of the sm particles , including those of the neutrinos , the extra @xmath0 symmetry can in general also dictates the mass spectrum of the sparticles , given the mediation mechanism of supersymmetry breaking .      the general soft susy breaking lagrangian",
    "is given by , @xmath187 where @xmath188 @xmath189 are the mass terms of the gaugino @xmath190 , @xmath191 and @xmath192 are the bi - linear and tri - linear terms , respectively , and @xmath193 are the scalar squared mass terms .    among various supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking mechanisms , anomaly mediated susy breaking ( amsb)@xcite turns out to be an extremely predictive framework , in which the soft masses for the sparticles are generated by the conformal anomaly . as a result , _ all _ soft masses are determined entirely by the low energy dynamics ( _ i.e. _ that of the mssm ) and one single parameter , @xmath194 , the f - term of some compensator chiral superfield .",
    "explicitly , @xmath195 where @xmath196 are the anomalous dimensions of the chiral superfields , @xmath197 are the @xmath21 terms and @xmath198 , @xmath199 are the @xmath200-functions of the gauge and yukawa couplings . with proper normalization , the f - term @xmath194 is taken to be the gravitino mass , @xmath201 .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the generic mssm , where 124 parameters are present mostly to account for the soft susy breaking sector .",
    "the high predictivity also leads to a severe problem in amsb models as generically the slepton masses are predicted to be tachyonic , because the electroweak gauge groups , @xmath14 and @xmath202 , of the mssm are not asymptotically free .",
    "squarks do not suffer from the same problem as @xmath203 is asymptotically free .",
    "the presence of an extra non - anomalous @xmath0 provides a rg invariant solution to the tachyonic slepton mass problem symmetry breaking scale in this case is close to the gut scale .",
    "consequently , the resulting @xmath81 boson is not accessible by the currently collider experiments . ] . in the presence of the @xmath0 , there are additional fayet - illiopolous ( fi ) d - term contributions to the scalar squared masses . including the additional fi - d term contributions to the scalar masses , the new scalar squared masses can be written as , @xmath204 @xmath205 , @xmath206 , etc denote the amsb contributions to the scalar squared masses .",
    "the parameter @xmath207 is the effective fayet - iliopoulos term setting the overall scale of the d - term contribution .",
    "similar to the discussion in the previous sections , if the matter superfields have generation dependent @xmath0 charges , then the @xmath0 symmetry can play the role of a family symmetry giving rise to all sm fermion masses and mixing angles .",
    "the same set of charges also enter into the predictions for the sfermion masses , as dictated by eq .",
    "[ eqn : fidmass1 ] .",
    "in addition , the anomaly cancellation conditions , which are required to ensure the rg invariance of the solutions , give very strong constraints on these charges .",
    "one characteristic feature of amsb in the presence of d - term contributions is the existence of sum rules among squared masses of the sparticles .",
    "as the @xmath0 symmetry in our model is generation - dependent and non - anomalous , the sum rules in this model are quite distinct from those found in other amsb models with @xmath0 symmetry@xcite . the anomaly cancellation constraints lead to the d - term contributions among various fields to be cancelled automatically .",
    "hence , the sum of the modified masses squared is still equal to the sum of mass square from the original amsb contribution .",
    "the anomaly cancellation conditions @xmath208^{2 } u(1)^{\\prime}$ ] , @xmath209^{2 } u(1)^{\\prime}$ ] , @xmath210^{2 } u(1)^{\\prime}$ ] , give rise to the following rg invariant mass sum rules , and @xmath211 @xmath212 where terms on the right - hand side are the pure amsb contributions , which are given in terms of @xmath213 and coefficients that are determined by the low energy dynamics ( i.e. , the gauge coupling constants and yukawa coupling constants of mssm ) .",
    "similarly , sum rules within each generation i and j ( @xmath214 ) can be derived from the @xmath0 gauge invariance@xcite , @xmath215    eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : sumsu3u1]-[eqn : sumu1y2u1 ] ) then lead to the following sum rules for the physical masses , @xmath216 these mass sum rules can be tested at the collider experiments .",
    "in addition to various sum rules , another characteristic attribute is that the degeneracy of the sfermion masses among the first two generations is lifted . in the generation",
    "independent @xmath0 senario , the first two generations of the sfermions in each sector have the same masses individually .",
    "however , in the generation dependent @xmath0 model , their mass squared splittings are proportional to the @xmath0 charge splitting , i.e. , @xmath217 which are non - zero and rg invariant .",
    "therefore , by measuring the mass splittings , it is possible to distinguish various @xmath0 models by identifying the charge splittings .",
    "tev scale mechanisms for neutrino mass generation afford the possibility of testing the mechanisms at low energy collider experiments .",
    "these models differ in their underlying symmetries as well as particle contents , leading to different signatures at the collider experiments and low energy lepton flavor violation searches . with the commissioning of the lhc and the superb factory as well as various lfv searches including meg and mu2e",
    ", it may thus be possible to reveal the origin of neutrino mass generation , if it indeed takes place at the tev scale .",
