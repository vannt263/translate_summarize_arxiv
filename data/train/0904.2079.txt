    "most near - solar - mass stars are born as members of binary or multiple systems @xcite . the formation of such systems , although the preferred mode of star formation at least for near - solar - mass stars , is poorly understood .",
    "the main competing theoretical models are fragmentation of dense molecular condensations to form systems comprising multiple protostars , or capture of originally single protostars still embedded in their individual condensations to form multiple systems ( e.g. , review by * ? ? ?",
    "the most direct way of distinguishing between these two possibilities is to compare for a given system the properties of its individual protostars ( i.e. , orientation of their circumstellar disks and their orbital motion ) with the properties of its surrounding molecular condensation ( i.e. , orientation and rotation ) .",
    "such a study of the low - mass protostellar system l1551  irs5 provides the most direct evidence yet that its two main protostellar components formed via the fragmentation of their surrounding parent molecular condensation @xcite . for many systems ( especially those with closely separated components ) , however , the properties of their individual protostellar components are difficult to measure until the extended very large array ( evla ) or atacama large millimeter and submillimeter array ( alma ) is completed . indeed , at the present time , even the number of protostellar components present in a given system is not always clear .",
    "bipolar molecular outflows , found ubiquitously around protostars , are more easily accessible , and can be used to indirectly probe the properties of multiple protostellar systems .",
    "for example , such outflows can reveal the presence of currently undetectable or spatially unresolved protostellar components through their individual outflows .",
    "outflows that wind in space with a helical pattern may have driving sources whose circumstellar disks and therefore jets are precessing due to gravitational interactions with closely - separated protostellar companions .",
    "the degree of collimation and/or dynamical age of the outflow , as well as the opening angle of the outflow cavity at its base , can provide a guide to the evolutionary stage of the driving source .    here",
    ", we study the bipolar molecular outflow associated with l1551  irs5 at a high angular resolution with an interferometric array . this system was first found as an infrared source by @xcite in the nearby ( distance @xmath0140 pc ) l1551 molecular cloud located in the constellation taurus .",
    "l1551  irs5 was the first protostellar source from which a bipolar molecular outflow , detected in single - dish observations of the co(10 ) and co(21 ) lines , was recognized @xcite .",
    "subsequent single - dish observations in co(10 ) , co(21 ) , and co(32 ) at higher angular resolutions have revealed the overall morphology and kinematics of this and a number of other outflows in the l1551 star - forming region on parsec scales @xcite .",
    "the most prominent of these outflows is centered on l1551  irs5 , and extends @xmath01.5 pc towards the ne ( redshifted lobe ) and sw ( blueshifted lobe ) directions at a position angle of @xmath0@xmath1 .",
    "each outflow lobe has a u - shaped structure , together with knotty components having distinct velocities .",
    "the other outflows detected in the l1551 cloud have been associated with other driving sources except for a collimated redshifted outflow with one end near l1551  irs5 and extending @xmath02 pc to the west , the origin of which is not known .",
    "apart from the large - scale bipolar molecular outflow , l1551  irs5 is surrounded by a relatively compact molecular condensation ( radius of @xmath01200  au in c@xmath2o ) that has been best studied by @xcite .",
    "this condensation is elongated in the nw - se direction , perpendicular to the major axis of the large - scale bipolar molecular outflow .",
    "the measured kinematics indicate a flattened envelope that is rotating and contracting , as also suggested in earlier observations by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this condensation has been observed in cs ( 76 ) , which traces warmer and denser gas closer to the central protostellar system , by @xcite . in the inner region of the envelope ,",
    "the kinematics is dominated by rotation .    the first indication that l1551  irs5 may be a binary system",
    "was reported by @xcite , who showed that this system comprised two sources separated by @xmath00.3  ( @xmath042  au ) in the north - south direction at a wavelength of 2  cm .",
    "subsequent studies resolved these two sources into twin ionized jets closely aligned with the large - scale bipolar molecular outflow @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed from high angular - resolution ( @xmath005 ) observations in the 2.7-mm continuum that l1551  irs5 contains two circumstellar dust disks surrounded by a circumbinary dust disk and/or extended envelope .",
    "@xcite spatially resolved the two circumstellar dust disks ( along their major axes ) for the first time at 7  mm , and showed that they are centered on the above - mentioned twin ionized jets .",
    "@xcite showed that these two protostellar components were ( likely ) orbiting each other in a clockwise direction .",
    "@xcite spatially resolved the two circumstellar disks along both their major and minor axes , and showed that these disks are aligned with each other as well their surrounding rotating and flattened molecular condensation ( pseudodisk ) .",
    "they also showed that the two components were orbiting each other in the same direction as the rotation of the pseudodisk .",
    "all these properties are consistent with the notion that the two protostellar components formed as a result of fragmentation in the central region of their surrounding pseudodisk .",
    "finally , @xcite found a candidate third protostellar component located ( in projection ) near the northern protostellar component .",
    "the circumstellar disk of this third component is misaligned relative to the circumstellar disks of the two main components as well as their surrounding pseudodisk .",
    "we report in this paper high angular resolution ( @xmath04 ) observations in co(21 ) centered on the base of the large - scale bipolar molecular outflow from l1551  irs5 .",
    "there is , to the best of our knowledge , only one other published interferometric image of this molecular outflow in co , that presented by @xcite in co(10 ) who studied relatively extended ( @xmath3 ) features in the blue outflow lobe . in our study , we investigate the structure and kinematics of the outflow components detected within @xmath030  of l1551  irs5 , their connection with the large - scale bipolar molecular outflow imaged with single - dish telescopes , and the likely nature of their driving sources .",
    "readers interested in how the observations were conducted and data reduced should now proceed to @xmath42 .",
    "those interested only in the results of the co(21 ) and simultaneous 1.3  mm continuum measurements can skip ahead to @xmath43 . in @xmath44 , we show that our co(21 ) maps likely traces three separate outflow components : the limb - brightened walls of an outflow cavity , material in the cavity entrained by one or both jets from the two main protostellar components , and a candidate third precessing bipolar outflow .",
    "readers interested only in a concise summary of our results and interpretation can proceed directly to @xmath45 .",
    "observations of l1551  irs5 in co(21 ) and 1.3 mm continuum were carried out using the sma in its compact configuration on 2003 december 7 .",
    "a description of the sma can be found in @xcite .",
    "the parameters of the observations are summarized in table  1 .",
    "seven of the eight antennas of the sma were available for the observations .",
    "we used the stronger quasar 0423 - 013 , lying 19.6@xmath5 from l1551  irs5 , for amplitude calibration , and the weaker quasar 3c  120 , lying 12.8@xmath5 from l1551  irs5 , for phase calibration .",
    "the flux density of 0423 - 013 was 9.4  jy and that of 3c  120 was 3.3  jy as measured with respect to uranus , which served as the absolute flux calibrator .",
    "the sma has a double - sideband receiver in the 230  ghz ( 1.3  mm ) band with a bandwidth of 2 ghz in each sideband .",
    "the lower sideband was tuned to a central frequency of 231.3  ghz , and the upper sideband 241.3  ghz .",
    "the signal in each sideband is fed into a correlator that distributes this signal to twenty - four spectral windows (  chunks  in the sma nomenclature ) .",
    "six of the chunks were divided into 512 channels , which in the co(21 ) line results in a velocity resolution of 0.265 km s@xmath6 over a velocity range of 135 km s@xmath6 .",
    "the remaining chunks were divided into 128 channels , and following calibration vector - averaged to make a single continuum channel at 1.3  mm with a total bandwidth of 4.0  ghz .",
    "the minimum projected baseline in our observation was @xmath08  k@xmath7 , allowing us to recover @xmath0@xmath8 of the flux from the largest structure visible in our co(21 ) maps of @xmath015  ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "we calibrated the raw visibility data using mir , which is an idl - based data reduction package adopted for the sma from the mma software package originally developed for ovro @xcite .",
    "we adopted antenna - based calibration , which provides the best sensitivity , as there were no significant baseline - based errors in our data .",
    "the calibrated visibility data were fourier - transformed to produce dirty images , and the point spread function of the telescope deconvolved ( cleaned ) from these images using miriad @xcite to produce the final maps .",
    "a robust parameter of 0.5 was adopted , which provided the best compromise between sensitivity and angular resolution .    to make the co(21 ) channel maps , we first subtracted the continuum emission from the visibility data as derived from a fit to the line - free channels . unlike in the continuum where the emission is centrally concentrated , in co(21 ) the emission in many channels",
    "is distributed in a complex manner over an extended region resulting in complicated sidelobe patterns . to clean the channel maps",
    ", we first selected ( i.e. , place boxes enclosing ) features that we believed to be real . through trial and error , we converged on features that changed smoothly in structure between neighboring channels , as would be expected for real features .",
    "an examination of the residual maps ( i.e. , after the candidate real features and their sidelobes had been removed ) revealed no systematic pattern ( i.e. , only random noise ) , indicating that all the real feature had indeed been correctly recovered .",
    "thus , we believe that any artificial components incorrectly selected for cleaning are much weaker than the real components in our maps .",
    "figure  1 shows our 1.3-mm continuum map of l1551  irs5 at an angular resolution of @xmath9 .",
    "the continuum emission peaks at the location of the protostellar system , as seen in images at comparable angular resolution at 3  mm @xcite and 0.8  mm @xcite .",
    "we fitted a two - dimensional gaussian to the continuum source to derive a total flux density of 1.20@xmath100.01  jy and a deconvolved size at full - width half - maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath11 along a position angle of @xmath12 .",
    "the size of the continuum source is much larger than the separation of the two main protostellar components ( @xmath00.3@xmath13 ) , implying that at least a part of the emission arises from the surrounding envelope .",
    "@xcite found that , at 3  mm , about half of the continuum emission arises from the circumstellar dust disks of the two main protostellar components ( their observation did not have sufficient angular resolution to spatially separate the candidate third protostellar component ) , and about half from the surrounding dust envelope .",
    "the continuum source detected here has an orientation similar to but size much smaller than the pseudodisk traced in c@xmath2o by @xcite , suggesting that the extended part of the continuum emission traces the inner regions of the pseudodisk .",
    "both free - free emission from ionized jets and thermal emission from dust can contribute to the continuum emission .",
    "in l1551  irs5 , as in many protostellar systems , the ionized jets dominate the emission at cm wavelength , whereas dust contributes an increasingly larger fraction of the emission towards shorter wavelengths . to assess the relative contribution from each component at a given wavelength",
    ", we have collected all relevant measurements of the continuum emission for l1551  irs5 at centimeter to submillimeter wavelength as listed in table  2 .",
    "figure  2 shows the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the continuum emission based on the tabulated data .",
    "we modeled the sed as the sum of two power - law components with each component having @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the intensity at a given frequency @xmath16 and @xmath17 the power - law index .",
    "a chi - squared fit to the data gives one component with @xmath18 that dominates at low frequencies ( short - dashed line in fig .",
    "2 ) , consistent with optically - thin free - free emission .",
    "the other component has @xmath19 that dominates at high frequencies ( long - dashed line in fig .",
    "2 ) , consistent with thermal emission from dust . as can be seen ,",
    "the contribution from free - free emission to the continuum at 1.3 mm is only @xmath0@xmath20 .",
    "assuming that the dust temperature ( @xmath21 ) is uniform , we can estimate the total dust mass of the continuum source from the relationship @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the distance to the source , @xmath24 is the blackbody function , @xmath21 the dust temperature and @xmath25 the dust mass opacity coefficient given by @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath27 is related to the spectral index , @xmath17 , of the dust continuum emission by the relationship @xmath17 = 2 + @xmath27 . assuming @xmath21 = 47 k @xcite , the dust mass inferred from equation  ( 1 ) is @xmath28 .",
    "this value is in reasonable agreement with those derived at 2.7  mm that are sensitive to the same size scales @xcite .",
    "figure  3 shows our co ( 21 ) channel maps of l1551  irs5 . for presentation purposes ,",
    "none of the maps displayed in this manuscript have been corrected for the primary beam response of the sma ; the quantities we computed were , of course , derived from maps corrected for the primary beam response .",
    "emission is detectable over the velocity range 0.2@xmath29 measured with respect to the local standard of rest ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "we estimate based on the symmetry of the features observed ( see below ) a systemic velocity of @xmath06.5 km s@xmath6 for the l1551  irs5 protostellar system , comparable to previous estimates @xcite .",
    "the absence of emission within @xmath0@xmath31 of the systemic velocity is likely caused by extended emission ( mostly from the ambient molecular cloud ) that is resolved out by the interferometer .",
    "figure  4 shows the integrated co(21 ) intensity map at blueshifted velocities spanning 0.2@xmath32 ( blue contours ) and redshifted velocities spanning 7.4@xmath29 ( red contours ) separately . to make this map , we first applied hanning smoothing ( a triangular function of width five channels at zero intensity ) to the channel maps , and then excluded all features in the channel maps where the intensity in the corresponding smoothed maps is less than 1.5@xmath33 .",
    "the most prominent feature in this map is an x - shaped structure ( as indicated by the diagonal lines ) that has its blueshifted pair of arms lying west and its redshifted pair of arms lying east of the protostellar system . in the channel maps of figure  3 ,",
    "the blueshifted part of this x - shaped structure can be most clearly seen at velocities spanning 2.3@xmath34 and the redshifted part 7.6@xmath29 .",
    "both pairs of arms have an opening angle of @xmath0@xmath35 , and extend @xmath02030  ( @xmath030004000",
    "au ) from center .",
    "they have a symmetry axis along the ne ",
    "sw direction at a position angle of about @xmath36 , which is close to the orientation of the major axes of the ionized jets as well as the large - scale bipolar molecular outflow .",
    "furthermore , the x - shaped structure exhibits the same velocity pattern ( i.e. , redshifted to the e and blueshifted to the w ) as the large - scale bipolar molecular outflow .    in both the channel maps of figure  3 and integrated - intensity map of figure  4 , the blueshifted nw arm can be seen to be much broader than the other three arms of the x - shaped structure .",
    "a close examination of the channel maps reveals that the nw arm comprises several distinct and relatively compact ( bullet - like ) spatial - kinematic components .",
    "for example , the broadest portion of the nw arm at about 10@xmath13 from center ( see fig .",
    "4 ) is dominated by a pair of comparatively high - velocity bullets that can be best seen in the channel maps ( fig .",
    "3 ) at velocities of 2.1@xmath373.4@xmath37 .",
    "the tip of the nw arm is dominated by two lower - velocity bullets that can be best seen in the channel maps at 3.7@xmath374.7@xmath37 . on the other hand ,",
    "the two redshifted arms each comprise only one spatial - kinematic component ( see below ) . in this way",
    ", the properties of the x - shaped component seem to mirror that of the large - scale bipolar molecular outflow .",
    "several distinct spatial - kinematic components have been seen in single - dish co(21 ) observations spaced at semi - regular intervals along the blueshifted outflow lobe of l1551  irs5 @xcite .",
    "curiously , no such distinct components are present in the same observations of the redshifted outflow lobe .",
    "figure  5 shows position - velocity ( pv- ) diagrams along each opposing set of arms as indicated by the diagonal lines in figure  4 .",
    "the straight lines drawn in figure  5 are not meant to guide the eye , but instead are our model fits to the pv - diagrams as we shall describe later in @xmath38 .",
    "the pv - diagrams along the ne ( fig .",
    "5(a ) , upper right quadrant ) and se ( fig .",
    "5(b ) , upper right quadrant ) arms look very similar , with each having a velocity at peak intensity that increases with radial distance ( i.e. , hubble - like expansion ) out to @xmath020  from center . the sw arm ( fig .",
    "5(a ) , lower left quadrant ) is only weakly detected in the pv - diagram , but nevertheless can be seen to have a velocity gradient comparable to the ne and se arms . on the other hand , the pv - diagram along the nw arm ( fig .",
    "5(b ) , lower left quadrant ) , shows at least two distinct velocity components .",
    "the component labeled nw - a increases comparatively quickly in velocity with radial distance out to @xmath010@xmath13 from center .",
    "the component labeled nw - b increases more slowly in velocity with radial distance out to @xmath030@xmath13 from center .",
    "nw - a corresponds to the pair of higher - velocity bullets , and nw - b to the pair of lower - velocity bullets , mentioned above .",
    "neither of these components have a velocity gradient that matches the comparable velocity gradients of the other three arms of the x - shaped component .",
    "the next most prominent feature in the integrated - intensity map of figure  4 is located between the blueshifted and redshifted arms of the x - shaped structure and extends to @xmath010@xmath13 from center .",
    "the outer portion of this feature on the ne side appears to twist north and that on the sw side twist south , creating a s - shaped structure .",
    "its symmetry axis is oriented at a position angle of about 55@xmath5 , approximately aligned with the symmetry axis of the x - shaped component as well as major axis of the large - scale bipolar molecular outflow .",
    "the s - shaped structure exhibits blueshifted velocities ne of center , and redshifted velocities sw of center . the velocity pattern of the s - shaped structure is therefore opposite to that of both the x - shaped structure and large - scale bipolar molecular outflow . in the channel maps of figure 3 , the blueshifted part of the s - shaped structure can be seen most clearly at velocities spanning 3.4@xmath32 and the redshifted part 7.4@xmath39 .",
    "the line - of - sight velocity of the s - shaped structure therefore does not reach velocities as high ( far from @xmath40 ) as the x - shaped structure .",
    "as described in @xmath41 , this structure exhibits an approximately sinusoidal variation in its radial velocity along its length .",
    "finally , a compact component centered on the location of l1551  irs5 can be seen in the channel maps of figure  3 extending to higher blueshifted and redshifted velocities than either the x- or s - shaped components .",
    "it is the only detectable or dominant component visible at blueshifted velocities spanning 0.2@xmath42 and redshifted velocities spanning 9.2@xmath29 . in the integrated - intensity map of figure  4 , although difficult to visually separate from the base of the x- or s - shaped structures , the compact central component comprises the closest redshifted and blueshifted intensity peaks straddling the l1551  irs5 protostellar system .    to better extract the properties of the compact central component ,",
    "we have fitted a two - dimensional gaussian structure to this component at each velocity where it is detectable in the channel maps .",
    "figure  6 shows the integrated co(21 ) intensity map made from the derived fits with the blueshifted and redshifted emission plotted separately .",
    "the centroids of the redshifted and blueshifted emissions are displaced by @xmath01.4  ( @xmath0200  au ) ne and sw from center , respectively , at a position angle of about 65 .",
    "the kinematic axis of this component is therefore closely aligned with the symmetry / major axis of , and has the same velocity pattern as , the x - shaped component and large - scale bipolar molecular outflows .      to better study the structure of the x- and s - shaped components near their base , we have subtracted the compact central component from the channel maps using the above - mentioned fits to this component ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "figure  7 shows the integrated co(21 ) intensity maps made before ( upper row ) and after ( lower row ) the compact central component was subtracted , separated into two different velocity regimes .",
    "the higher velocity regime ( fig .  7 , left column ) spans 0.2@xmath42 ( i.e. , @xmath44 ) at blueshifted velocities ( blue contours ) and 8.9@xmath29 ( @xmath45 ) at redshifted velocities ( red contours ) . the lower velocity regime ( fig .",
    "7 , right column ) spans 3.7@xmath32 ( @xmath46 ) at blueshifted velocities ( blue contours ) and 7.4@xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) at redshifted velocities ( red contours ) .",
    "like before , to make these maps we first applied hanning smoothing ( a triangular function of width five channels at zero intensity ) to the channel maps , and then excluded all features in the channel maps where the intensity in the corresponding smoothed maps is less than 1.5@xmath33 .    the s - shaped component , which as mentioned above does not reach velocities as high as the x - shaped component , is barely detectable in the higher velocity regime . in this regime ,",
    "the compact central component can be well separated from the x - shaped component as can be seen by comparing the map made before and after subtraction . in the lower velocity regime ,",
    "all three components are detectable .",
    "the compact central component dominates the emission close to the protostellar system as can be seen by comparing the map made before and after subtraction .",
    "we have estimated physical parameters for all three components separately after correcting our maps for the primary beam response of the sma antennas .",
    "for simplicity , we assumed that the observed co(21 ) emission is optically thin , in local thermal equilibrium ( lte ) , and has an excitation temperature of 10  k as derived by @xcite based on the intensity ratio between co(32 ) and co(10 ) .",
    "we also assumed a h@xmath49-to - co abundance ratio of @xmath50 .",
    "we adopted an inclination of @xmath51 with respect to the plane of the sky for all three components , such that their major axes are orthogonal to the equatorial plane of the circumstellar disks of the two main protostellar components and their surrounding flattened condensation @xcite . as we shall discuss later (  4.3 ) , the adopted inclination is probably appropriate for the x - shaped and compact central components , and close to median value in the allowed range from our model fit for the s - shaped component ( but with the ne side the near side , opposite to the x - shaped and compact central components ) .    in table  3 , we tabulate for each component its estimated mass @xmath52 , outflow momentum @xmath53 , kinetic energy @xmath54 , mass loss rate @xmath55 , and dynamical age corresponding to the maximum derived dynamical time @xmath56 = @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the distance from the driving source to the emission peak of the outflowing gas at a given velocity @xmath59 .",
    "note that all these values except for dynamical age are lower limits , in part because we have assumed that the co(2 - 1 ) emission is optically thin , and in part because emission close to the systemic velocity was entirely resolved out .",
    "the x - shaped component , which is the most obvious component in our map , dominates in mass , momentum , and energy .",
    "it also has the oldest dynamical age .",
    "the mass - loss rate is highest for the compact central component , which also has the youngest dynamical age .",
    "our co(21 ) map at an angular resolution of @xmath60 reveals , for the first time , three distinct bipolar molecular outflow components in the vicinity ( @xmath61  au ) of the l1551  irs5 protostellar system . in the following",
    ", we shall discuss the likely nature of each of these components as well as their driving sources .",
    "the x - shaped component has a symmetry axis closely aligned with and exhibits the same velocity pattern as the large - scale bipolar molecular outflow .",
    "it has the largest mass , momentum , and energy of the three outflow components that we detected in the vicinity of the l1551  irs5 protostellar system .",
    "this x - shaped component resembles similar structures seen around a number of other protostars such as irs1 in barnard  5 @xcite , iras 20582 + 7724 in l1228 @xcite , and iras  5295 + 1247 in l1528b @xcite . in all these cases ,",
    "the x - shaped structure observed is thought to comprise the limb - brightened walls of a cone - shaped cavity entrained and excavated by outflows from the central protostars .",
    "indeed , scattered light from a cone - shaped cavity can be seen in the near - ir on the sw side of l1551  irs5 @xcite with an opening angle comparable to that measured for the ( blueshifted ) arms of the x - shaped component .",
    "( the ne side of the cavity is presumably obscured in the near - ir by material in the condensation and extended envelope . )",
    "@xcite have conducted a @xmath62co survey of molecular outflows within @xmath63@xmath50  au of nine protostellar ( comprising a mixture of both single and multiple ) systems at different evolutionary stages .",
    "they found a clear difference in the morphology of the molecular outflow lobes between class  0 and more evolved class  i protostars .",
    "class  0 protostars exhibit relatively collimated jet - like outflows or cone - shaped lobes with opening angles @xmath64 , whereas class  i protostars have outflow lobes with wider opening angles of @xmath65 ( with @xmath0@xmath66 the largest opening angle seen ) .",
    "l1551  irs5 is classified ( based on its infrared sed ) as a class i protostar @xcite , and so the opening angle of its outflow cavity ( @xmath0@xmath35 ) is comparable with that seen around other protostars at a similar evolutionary stage .    near - ir",
    "observations in the [ fe ii ] line by @xcite have revealed two velocity components in the ionized outflow from the main northern protostellar component in l1551  irs5 .",
    "one of these outflow components comprises a high - velocity ( @xmath0@xmath67 ) and narrowly - collimated wind , and the other a low - velocity ( @xmath0@xmath68 ) and wide - angle wind .",
    "the latter has an opening angle of @xmath0100@xmath5 , which is similar to the opening angle of the cavity seen through scattered light in the near - ir and as the x - shaped component .",
    "the x - shaped component may therefore have formed in two steps : first the high - velocity and narrowly - collimated wind passes through and in the process entrains molecular gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , followed by a low - velocity and wide - angle wind that pushes forward and aside the molecular gas to excavate a cone - shaped cavity . @xcite",
    "have found that the large - scale bipolar molecular outflow associated with l1551",
    "irs5 exhibits several successive high - velocity features along its blueshifted lobe suggestive of different ejection episodes",
    ". the x - shaped component may therefore comprise ( primarily ) the base of that portion of the larger - scale outflow created in the latest ejection episode .",
    "we now investigate what properties a cone - shaped outflow cavity should have to reproduce both the observed structure and kinematics of the x - shaped component .",
    "figure  8 shows a sketch of a cone with a half - opening angle @xmath69 and its symmetry axis inclined by an angle @xmath70 to the plane of the sky .",
    "as suggested by the pv - diagrams of figure  5 , we assume that the cone exhibits a hubble - like radial expansion such that its radial velocity is given by @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the coefficient of the radial flow and @xmath58 the radial distance from the driving source .",
    "we assume @xmath73 so that the symmetry axis is orthogonal to the circumstellar disks of the two main protostellar components ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and measure from the integrated - intensity map of figure  4 a half - opening angle of @xmath74 .",
    "the only free parameter is therefore @xmath72 , which in the pv - diagram of figure  5 specifies the observed velocity gradient along the arms of the x - shaped component .",

    "the compact central component has its major axis aligned with the symmetry axis of the x - shaped component , as well as major axis of the large - scale bipolar molecular outflow .",
    "furthermore , it exhibits the same velocity pattern as both these more spatially extended components .",

    "here , we propose that shocks produced when one or both jets slam into molecular gas diverted into the x - shaped cavity provide a simpler if not more plausible explanation for the observed x - ray emission .",
    "the resulting entrained molecular gas would be expected to extend beyond the location of the x - ray source , as is observed for the compact central component . to produce the observed x - ray luminosity and plasma temperature ,",

    "furthermore , this component exhibits the lowest ( projected ) maximum detectable velocity of all three components .",
    "below , we consider three possible explanations for this component : i ) the near and far sides of the outflow cavity walls ; ii ) a precessing outflow ; and iii ) an outflow that winds in space due to the orbital motion of its driving source .      here , we consider the possibility that the s - shaped component is part of the same outflow cavity traced by the x - shaped component . in the model described in @xmath38 , the outflow cavity has a half - opening angle ( @xmath045 ) that is larger than its inclination to the plane of the sky ( @xmath030 ) .",

    "<S> the multiple protostellar system l1551  irs5 exhibits a large - scale bipolar molecular outflow that spans @xmath01.5  pc on both the ne ( redshifted ) and sw ( blueshifted ) sides of the system . </S>",
    "<S> we have studied this outflow within @xmath04000  au of its driving source(s ) with the submillimeter array . </S>",
    "<S> our co(21 ) image at @xmath04  ( @xmath0560  au ) resolution reveals three distinct components : 1 ) an x - shaped structure spanning @xmath020  from center with a similar symmetry axis and velocity pattern as the large - scale outflow ; 2 ) an s - shaped structure spanning @xmath010  from center also with a similar symmetry axis but opposite velocity pattern to the large - scale outflow ; and 3 ) a compact central component spanning @xmath01.4  from center again with a similar symmetry axis and velocity pattern as the large - scale outflow . </S>",
    "<S> the x - shaped component likely comprises the limb - brightened walls of a cone - shaped cavity excavated by the outflows from the two main protostellar components . </S>",
    "<S> the compact central component likely comprises material within this cavity newly entrained by one or both outflows from the two main protostellar components . </S>",
    "<S> the s - shaped component mostly likely comprises a precessing outflow with its symmetry axis inclined in the opposite sense to the plane of the sky than the other two components , taking the s - shaped component out of the cone - shaped cavity along most if not all of its entire length . </S>",
    "<S> this outflow may be driven by a recently reported candidate third protostellar component in l1551  irs5 , whose circumstellar disk is misaligned relative to the two main protostellar components . </S>",
    "<S> gravitational interactions between this protostellar component and its likely more massive northern ( and perhaps also southern ) neighbor(s ) may be causing the circumstellar disk and hence outflow of this component to precess . </S>"
