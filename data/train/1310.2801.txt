    "the scarcity of x - ray detections among wr nebulae is also intriguing ; there are only two wr nebulae detected in diffuse x - rays : s308 and ngc6888 @xcite .",
    "these two wr bubbles share several characteristics : the x - ray - emitting plasma is confined inside optical shells where the h@xmath12 emission presents a clumpy distribution inside an [ o  iii ] shell @xcite , and both bubbles are nitrogen - rich and surround wn stars with terminal wind velocities of @xmath01800  km  s@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this configuration can be pictured as the wr wind sweeping up the previously ejected red supergiant(rsg ) wind material whilst the central star photoionizing this material .",

    "we have carried out the study of the hot gas of ngc6888 in several steps .",
    "first , we have studied the emission from the nebular gas detected in ccds3 and ccds4 , keeping in mind that the former has more reliable spectral resolution and sensitivity at lower energies than ccds4 .",
    "therefore , we have defined two regions encompassing the diffuse x - ray emission registered in the field of view of the _ chandra _ acis - s ccds3 and s4 ( green polygonal lines in figure  1 ) .    for further analysis , we have defined several smaller polygonal aperture regions , also shown in figure  1 , corresponding to different features presented in ngc6888 : regions labeled as a comprise the apparent shell and caps , and regions labeled with b correspond to the shell interior .",
    "we note that both regions are present within each ccd detector , and thus we have extracted two spectra corresponding to each morphological feature .",
    "for example , a1 corresponds to a region extracted from ccds3 and a2 to a region extracted from ccds4 .",
    "the same applies to regions b1 and b2 .      as discussed in @xcite , the extraction of spectra from extended sources , as is the case of wr bubbles , is challenging because the emission fills almost the entire field of view of the instrument .",
    "the background contribution can be estimated from high signal - to - noise blank fields , but as mentioned by @xcite , this technique does not produce suitable results because wr bubbles are located in regions close to the galactic plane where extinction and background emission are significant @xcite . to show the contribution of the galactic background , we plot in figure  3 the background - unsubtracted spectrum from ccds3 and a background spectrum extracted from the edge of the camera .",
    "x - ray emission from the background is soft and show lines in the 0.31.0  kev energy band from thermal components ( see also figure  5 in * ? ? ?",
    "* for the case of s308 ) .",
    "the spectral shape of the background emission certainly differs from that derived from acis blank - field observations .",
    "therefore , the most feasible procedure to subtract the background contribution is the use of background spectra extracted from areas near the camera edges , even though the instrumental responses for sources and background regions do not completely match each other .        [ fig : spec_raw ]    the individual background - subtracted spectra of the diffuse emission of the ne quadrant and western region of ngc6888 ( namely ccds3 and ccds4 ) are presented in figure  4 , as well as the individual spectra extracted from regions a1 , a2 , b1 , and b2 .",
    "all spectra were extracted using the ciao task _ specextract _ , which generates the source and background spectra and their corresponding calibration files .",
    "the most notable differences in the spectral shapes are attributed to the differences in sensitivity of the acis - s ccds3 and ccds4 .",
    "all spectra are soft and show two main peaks , a narrow peak at 0.5  kev and a broader peak around 0.70.9  kev .",
    "the feature around 0.5  kev can be identified with the n  vii ion , while the feature around @xmath00.70.9  kev can be associated with the fe complex and ne lines . above 1.0 kev , the emission declines and",
    "diminishes at energies @xmath221.5 kev .",
    "we note that the spectra extracted from ccds4 show the instrumental au m complex at 2.2  kev , which has not been properly removed due to the reduced spatial extent of the background region .",

    "indeed , they present a spectrum corresponding to a nitrogen - rich plasma that shows two main components , one at 0.5  kev and another at @xmath00.9  kev , very similar to the spectra presented in figure  4 ( see also * ? ? ? * for a comparison with models without thermal conduction ) .    finally , it is interesting to check whether the central star of ngc6888 can provide the observed x - ray - emitting material .",
    "@xcite could match the morphology of their 2d simulations with that of ngc6888 at a time @xmath012,000  yr after the onset of the wr phase .",
    "that time - lapse is further reduced to @xmath08,000  yr when the dynamical effects on the nebular material of the photoionization are accounted @xcite . for a mass - loss rate of 3.1@xmath4910@xmath96 @xmath97  yr@xmath5 @xcite , the total mass provided by the star amounts up to 0.250.37 @xmath97 , which is smaller than the estimate of @xmath981  @xmath79 for the mass of hot plasma inside ngc6888",
    "apparently , the wr wind has not had sufficient time to inject all the hot gas inside ngc6888 .",
    "this supports the possibility that physical processes such as thermal conduction have transferred material from the outer rsg shell into the hot bubble .",
    "the enhanced n / o ratio of the hot plasma , similar to that measured in the cold shell through optical emission lines , is in concordance with this possibility .",
    "we present _ chandra _ acis - s observations of the ne quadrant and western regions of ngc6888 .",
    "we have used these observations to study the spatial distribution of the diffuse x - ray emission inside the nebula and derived global values of its physical conditions .",
    "in particular we find :    * the hot gas in ngc6888 is distributed inside the optical shell delineated by [ oiii ] emission .",
    "the spatial distribution of the x - ray emission shows enhancements towards the caps and a blowout present in the nw region of ngc6888 .",
    "this blowout , not discussed in previous studies , has no h@xmath12 counterpart , but an outer _ skin _ of [ o  iii ] is detected .",
    "the x - ray - emitting gas is , thus , traced by h@xmath12 clumps inside the nebular shell and by the blowout .",
    "no clear evidence of limb - brightening is detected . *",
    "the x - ray emission is dominated by the n  vii 0.5  kev line with additional contributions of the fe complex and ne  ix line at 0.70.9  kev .",
    "the spectrum declines with energy , fading at energies higher than 1.5 kev .",
    "the x - ray emission from ngc6888 can be described by a two - temperature optically thin plasma emission model with temperatures of @xmath01.4@xmath4910@xmath50  k and 7.4@xmath4910@xmath50  k. * the intrinsic total flux emitted by ngc6888 in the 0.3 - 2 kev energy band is estimated to be @xmath99  erg  @xmath14  s@xmath5 , and the x - ray luminosity at a distance of 1.26  kpc is @xmath76  erg  s@xmath5 . * the estimated rms electron density @xmath33 of the x - ray - emitting gas ranges between @xmath100 and @xmath101  @xmath7 resulting in an estimated total mass of @xmath102 and @xmath103 , respectively .",
    "the density , temperature , and abundance of the x - ray - emitting gas are consistent with the expectation of thermal conduction at the wind - wind interaction zone , where the rsg wind material is mixed in the shocked wr wind in the bubble interior .",
    "future _ xmm - newton _ observations are needed to acquire a complete view of the soft x - ray emission from the hot plasma in ngc6888 with better spatial coverage , sensitivity , and energy resolution than the existing studies . as the blowout detected in ngc6888",
    "is at the edge of the cameras of the acis - s instrument and a significant section of the bubble remains unobserved , _ xmm - newton _ observations could finally unveil the total distribution of the hot gas in this nebula .",
    "the soft sensitivity and spatial coverage of such observations would also be very valuable to assess the varying amounts of intervening material across the nebula suggested by optical and infrared observations .",
    "we want to thank the anonymous referee for her / his comments that improved the presentation of the technical details in this paper .",
