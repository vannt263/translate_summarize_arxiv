    "the @xmath5 enhancement of nonleptonic kaon decays is a well - known feature which has still not been completely explained .",
    "most existing lattice calculations find a @xmath0 amplitude which is a factor of two larger than the experimental value .",
    "this @xmath0 amplitude also enters present phenomenology through the chiral determination of the @xmath6 parameter which is part of the standard model prediction of cp violation .",

    "we do not know if the disagreement in @xmath6 is due to the failure of the lattice approach to reproduce the experimental amplitude or if there are large chiral corrections responsible for the difference .    in both these applications",

    "since the @xmath8 amplitude is so much larger , it is possible that electromagnetic corrections to it may simulate an effect which is similar to the small @xmath9 amplitude .",
    "these electromagnetic corrections enter at order @xmath10 , which can be comparable to a sizeable portion of the @xmath9 amplitude @xmath11 .",
    "the possibility then emerges that the relevant experimental amplitude ( without electromagnetism ) could differ significantly from that presently being used in phenomenology .",

    ", we will present a more comprehensive analysis of electromagnetic radiative corrections in kaon decays .",
    "the full system , particularly the decay @xmath12 , brings in several additional complications , such as the coulomb effect on the final state , the violations of watson s theorem from the mixing of final states and the induced @xmath13 effect .",
    "however , the decay @xmath14 is particularly simple and can by itself be used to answer the question that we have raised above . among our results in this paper are :    1 .",
    "the long distance portion of the leading chiral result satisfies the relation @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the long distance part of the pion electromagnetic mass difference and the other constants are defined below .",
    "this leading long distance effect is canceled exactly by the effect of pion mass differences in the usual weak amplitude .",
    "3 .   there are , however , residual effects coming from intermediate energies and the electroweak penguin operator .",
    "although we allow generous uncertainties associated with intermediate energies , it is clear that the net residual effect is quite small .",
    "chiral symmetry provides the framework for structuring our calculation .",

    ".1 cm 1.5 cm      at the quark level , electromagnetic corrections to the weak transition @xmath22 fall into two distinct classes ( _ cf _ fig .  1 ) , which we call the chiral ( ch ) and electromagnetic - penguin ( emp ) components , ( 0 ) = m_ch + m_emp  .",

    "@xcite , this is equivalent to an effective fermi constant defined as g_nl ( | ) = g _  , [ sd1 ] where @xmath24 is an energy scale lying in the region where perturbation theory is valid and @xmath25 is the fermi constant measured in muon decay .",
    "this shift does not lead to mixing of isospin amplitudes and is irrelevant for the purposes of this paper .",

    "we now introduce some useful chiral lagrangians .",
    "the weak interactions involve left - handed currents only and the nonleptonic hamiltonian has an octet and 27-plet component .",
    "the lowest - order weak lagrangian for the dominant octet portion involves two derivatives , _ 8  =  g_8 ( _ 6 d_u d^u^ )  , [ 12 ] with @xmath28 .",
    "electromagnetic corrections involve both left - handed and right - handed effects , and can lead to lagrangians which do not involve derivatives .",
