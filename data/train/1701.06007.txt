    "[ introduction ] it has been known that the nucleon is a bound state of three valence quarks since 1970s .",
    "many nucleon resonances , referred as @xmath8 , have been observed  @xcite , the properties of nucleon resonances are the important issues in hadronic physics , and attract lots of attentions  @xcite . for the nucleon resonances with masses below 2 gev , their properties have been widely investigated in literature .",
    "however , the current knowledge on the properties of nucleon excited states with masses above 2 gev is scarce . on the other hand , many miss @xmath8s , predicted by the constituent quark models are not yet found  @xcite .",
    "recently , the clas collaboration measured the @xmath0 meson for the first time in photoproduction from a proton target , and presented the @xmath0 differential photoproduction cross section into @xmath9 final states from the threshold up to a center - of - mass ( c.m . )",

    "@xcite shows that the @xmath14 cross section exhibits much stronger @xmath2- and @xmath15-channel signatures in the angle dependence than dose the @xmath0 , which is quite flat .",
    "this may imply that the @xmath0 photoproduction mechanism is not dominated by @xmath2-channel production processes .    before the experimental study on @xmath7  @xcite",
    ", there are several theoretical works on this reaction . within the regge - model , considering the exchanges of @xmath2-channel @xmath3 and @xmath4 trajectories , kochelev _ et al .",

    "comparison of the regge - model calculations and the clas data shows the @xmath2-channel production process alone does not reproduce the clas measurements . within a model motivated by chern - simons - term - induced interactions in holographic qcd , domokos _ et al . _",

    "the results of huang _",
    "are also much smaller than the clas data . in order to describe the clas data ,",
    "the further model calculations are needed .",
    "the differences between these model predictions and the clas data suggest that the @xmath5-channel intermediate baryon resonances may play an important role in the reaction of @xmath16 .",
    "that is to say , the decay of the excited @xmath8 intermediate states may be important , as pointed out by the clas collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the reaction of @xmath7 filters the nucleon resonances with isospin @xmath17 , and provides a natural mode to investigate the higher excited nucleon resonance with a mass above 2.2  gev and a sizeable coupling to the final states @xmath18 .    among the possible nucleon resonances @xmath8 ( @xmath19 @xmath20 , @xmath21 @xmath22 , @xmath6 @xmath23 )   ( @xmath19 @xmath20 , @xmath21 @xmath22 , @xmath6 @xmath23 ) in the mass range of 2.2 - 2.5 gev .",

    "it would be expected that @xmath18 @xmath28 and @xmath27 waves are strongly suppressed and the @xmath26 wave is dominant .    in the present work",
    ", we shall study the reaction of @xmath7 within the regge - effective lagrangian approach by considering both the @xmath2-channel @xmath3 and @xmath4 trajectories exchanges and the @xmath5-channel @xmath6 resonance mechanism .",
