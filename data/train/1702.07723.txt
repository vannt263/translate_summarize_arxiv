    "gluons , quarks , and perhaps monopoles  looks to be an impossible task , since all of them interact strongly .",
    "however , more recent studies have provided valuable insight , indicating that this task can perhaps be carried out .",
    "the first step toward understanding of the role of monopoles in qcd is to move from the @xmath98 to the @xmath115 color group .",
    "this is far from trivial , since the latter has two diagonal color generators , and thus two  massless electrodynamics \" surviving the breaking of the color group .",
    "therefore , there are two distinct species of the monopoles . including the anti - monopoles , one would need to study a _",
    "four_-component coulomb bose gas .",
    "this system can be studied in the same way as for the one and two - component gases above , but was not done for this work .",
    "note that two species of monopoles are not independent , as there should be attractive coulomb forces between the monopoles of each @xmath99 electrodynamics , as well as repulsive forces between monopoles and anti - monopoles of different @xmath99 electrodynamics .",
    "a comprehensive study of the condensation and density of lattice monopoles for the @xmath115 color group has been done by bonati and delia @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "3 of that work , both monopole species happen to have nearly identical densities . moreover , fig .",
    "2 and the corresponding text from @xcite indicate that , for each of them , the density @xmath116 is very close to that of the @xmath98 monopoles ; these densities effectively identical when taking into account the difference in @xmath0 for the different @xmath98 and @xmath115 simulations .",
    "however , they have a slightly different fit from the @xmath98 data at high @xmath117 , namely @xmath118 this power of the logarithm matches predictions from the 1970s for finite-@xmath65 qcd : the magnetic scale cubed @xmath119 .",
    "the next step toward qcd would be to include quarks .",
    "the corresponding lattice simulations are unfortunately very expensive , especially for quarks as light as those in the real world . only relatively recently",
    "have such lattice ensembles became available , and the analysis of their monopole content has not yet been done . lacking simulation input , we will provide some speculation on  theoretical expectations . \"",
    "let us start from the high-@xmath65 end , simply counting states .",
    "gluons have two polarizations and @xmath120 colors , giving 16 bosonic states .",
    "quarks contribute @xmath121 ( for @xmath122 , @xmath123 ) times the thermal energy of one bosonic state .",
    "monopoles are charged spin - zero scalars , of @xmath124 types ( the number of diagonal generators multiplied by 2 to take into account the two charges ) , or 4 species for @xmath125 . at high",
    "@xmath65 they only exist at the so - called magnetic scale , and thus their density is additionally suppressed by a power of @xmath126 , as discussed above . as a result , at high @xmath65 ,",
    "the monopole contribution is quite small as compared to that of quarks and gluons .",
    "this is not the end of the story , however , because the light quarks can be bound to the monopoles .",
    "the corresponding dirac equation has no coupling , and the fermionic 3d zero modes are of topological nature , thus they should be present at _ any _ @xmath65 . while these bound states are scalars ",
    "the spin 1/2 and the color spin 1/2 add up to the grand spin 0  the quark zero mode can be either occupied or empty , interpreted as 2 separate states , a doublet of the baryon number @xmath127 @xcite .",
    "so , in the theory with a single light quark , @xmath128 , the number of magnetic states doubles .    in a theory with @xmath129 , one can get the @xmath130 _ triplet _ of states",
    ". its flavor - asymmetric wave function can be , for example , viewed as the isospin-0 @xmath131 diquark , the antidiquark , and also the @xmath132 isoscalar meson added to a monopole .",
    "the number of magnetically charged states is , in this case , @xmath133 .",
    "while this is still smaller than the number of quark and gluon degrees of freedom , it is not a negligible contribution .",
    "a qualitative observation made by liao and shuryak @xcite was that , with the number of monopole - quark species growing with @xmath134 , it becomes more and more difficult to produce bose - einstein condensation , since the objects become distinguishable .",
    "this tendency can only be counterbalanced by a corresponding increase of the monopole density . and indeed , lattice simulations for qcd - like theories with an increasing @xmath134 have found that deconfinement transition corresponds to stronger coupling @xmath135 , smaller monopole mass and therefore higher monopole density .",
    "all dimensional quantities are defined following standard lattice convention for units : the vacuum string tension for all theories is declared to be the same in mev . with such units , the critical temperature for @xmath98 and @xmath115 is different , @xmath136 mev for @xmath98 and @xmath137 mev for @xmath115 , but the densities of each of the @xmath98 and @xmath115 monopoles are about the same @xcite .",
    "if @xmath0 is lower , the overall density of monopoles grows , so the density of each separate species of monopole becomes large enough to form a bose - einstein condensate .",
    "recall that , as was found in @xcite , we observed that the inclusion of an additional interacting component to a bose coulomb system did not alter the critical temperature behavior , provided the density of each component was not altered .",
    "the spectroscopy of quark - monopole states in qcd at zero temperature would be very hard to study , because the hybrid ( meson - glueball ) states would be heavy and wide , mixing with many other mesonic states .",
    "but at @xmath138 , where the monopoles are relatively light , these states can perhaps be identified .",
    "theoretically , it is also hard to predict their masses ; while the dirac equation for quark fields are indeed written exactly without any coupling present , the yang - mills equations for the monopole gauge field itself has only been solved in the classical approximation , in which it is assumed that the monopole action is much larger than the ( one - loop ) quark correction to it . as discussed above , this is no longer so near @xmath0 .",
    "going back to the thermodynamics of qcd , a historically important argument has been related with the mean value of the polyakov line , @xmath139 . according to lattice data , @xmath139 approaches 1 at high @xmath65 very slowly",
    ": it reaches 0.8 at @xmath140 mev according to fig . 3 of @xcite , or @xmath141 mev according to fig . 1 of @xcite .",
    "this quite far from @xmath142 mev .",
    "while literally it should be applied to the static quarks , one can @xmath143 that the thermodynamical contributions of light quarks should also be proportional to it , @xmath144 this led to the development of the polyakov - nambu - jona - lasinio ( pnjl ) model @xcite and similar models .",
    "direct lattice studies , e.g. @xcite , were able to identify the density of strange quarks , @xmath145 , using a certain combination of susceptibilities vanishing for mesons and baryons , but not for quarks .",
    "their results confirm this conjecture rather well .",
    "one may further argue that the density of ( color non - diagonal ) gluons should then be proportional to the square of the polyakov line , @xmath146 .",
    "if so , @xmath147 must be even more suppressed near @xmath0 than @xmath148 .    at the same time , the energy and entropy densities , @xmath109 and @xmath149 , respectively , rise to their approximate scale - invariant value much more rapidly , by @xmath150 mev or so , unlike 200 - 300 mev for @xmath139 .",
    "see , for example , fig .",
    "6 of @xcite .",
    "the inevitable conclusion from these arguments is that there must be some extra contribution , in addition to the quarks and gluons , in this interval of temperature .",
    "it was suggested , e.g. in @xcite , that there should be _ bound states _ of quarks  mesons and baryons  at @xmath3 .",
    "the presence of those are indeed well documented now on the lattice , e.g. in @xcite for strange quarks and later for charmed ones .",
    "we now turn to the following question : what is the contribution of the _ monopoles _ to the global thermodynamics ?",
    "since the monopoles are identified on the lattice individually , with their euclidean - time paths and correlation functions determined from simulation , it should be possible to calculate their energy . lamentably",
    ", this has not been done yet .     and @xmath115 .",
    "the estimates for the monopole contribution to @xmath115 and qcd are from a scaling argument ( see text ) .",
    "lattice @xmath98 results are from @xcite , @xmath115 from @xcite , and qcd from @xcite . ]",
    "a comparison of the energy density contribution of monopoles to the overall energy density found on the lattice is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_latencomp ] .",
    "the @xmath98 comparison is direct from our study , as this is the same system from which we found our parameter fits . for @xmath115 on the other hand , we have estimated the monopole contribution to the energy density by simply multiplying the contribution by 2 , as discussed above .",
    "this , of course , does not take into account the energy coming from the interaction between the two species , which will have to be studied further in the future .",
    "finally , for qcd , from standard counting of degrees of freedom , one finds that quarks have about twice more of those than gluons , so the qgp energy density in qcd is about 3 times larger than in the pure gauge @xmath115 .",
    "the number of quark - monopole states , as we argued above , for two light flavors also increase the number of species by the factor of 3 .",
    "the monopole mass , as found in @xcite , contributes significantly more to the overall thermodynamics than the internal energy of the monopoles ( c.f .",
    "[ fig_su2en ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig_latencomp ] , we see the total energy density contribution from the monopoles to the system . when the mass is included , the monopoles contribution constitutes the _ entire _ energy density of the system between 1 - 1.3@xmath0 .",
    "in this work , we have studied the effects of coulombic interaction on the bose - einstein condensation .",
    "we numerically calculated the critical temperature @xmath0 , of one- and two - component coulomb systems , by two different methods , as a function of the interaction strength .",
    "qualitatively , the dependence is the similar to what has been previously observed for hard spheres : @xmath0 moderately grow at weak coupling , but strongly decreases at strong coupling .",
    "we also studied the spatial correlations in these systems at various temperatures and coupling strengths .",
    "we then mapped the results of the two - component case to the results of lattice simulations of color magnetic monopoles in pure - gauge @xmath98 , and find a very good agreement .",
    "this comparison allowed us to fix the  physical line \" in the parameter space of our effective model in @xmath98 gauge theory , at and above @xmath0 . as a result of simulations",

    "we speculate that the same is true in qcd with light quarks , although the questions related with properties of monopole - quark composites have not yet been addressed .    now having an effective quantum model for magnetic sector of the gauge theories",

    "<S> magnetic monopoles are suggested to play an important role in strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma ( sqgp ) near the deconfinement temperature . </S>",
    "<S> so far , their many - body treatment has only been done classically , with just binary scattering solved in quantum mechanics . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we start _ quantum _ many - body studies of the monopole ensembles . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we carry out numerical simulations of the path integral for one- and two - component coulomb bose systems . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the relation between the critical temperature for the bose - einstein condensation phase transition @xmath0 and the coulomb coupling strength using two methods , the classic finite - size scaling of the condensate and a lattice - tested method based on permutation cycles . for a one - component coulomb bose gas </S>",
    "<S> , we observe the same behavior of the critical temperature  initially rising slightly then falling as interaction strength is increased  as seen in the case of hard spheres ; we also observe the same behavior for a two - component coulomb bose gas . </S>",
    "<S> we then calculate sets of radial correlation functions between the like and unlike charged particles . by matching those with the correlation functions previously calculated on the lattice , we derive an effective quantum model of color magnetic monopoles in qcd . from this matched model , </S>",
    "<S> we are able to extract the monopole contribution to qcd equation of state near @xmath0 . </S>"
