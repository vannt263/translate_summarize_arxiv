    "water has many anomalies compared to normal liquids @xcite .",
    "experiments show that its thermodynamics fluctuations and response functions , such as the isobaric specific heat @xmath9 or the magnitude of the isobaric thermal expansion coefficient @xmath10 , largely increase when temperature is decreased @xcite .",
    "these anomalies are more pronounced in the supercooled liquid state , below 0@xmath11c .",

    "the anomalies have been interpreted on the basis of models that propose different scenarios .",
    "the scenarios can be divided in two main categories : @xmath15 those scenarios that include the coexistence at low @xmath0 of two liquids with different densities , and @xmath16 a scenario in which water forms local regions of different densities , but does not separate into two phases .      _ the liquid - liquid critical point scenario_. in 1992 poole _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , on the basis of molecular dynamic simulations for st2- and tip4p - water , proposed that supercooled water separates into two liquid phases with different densities below 200  k and above 150  mpa .",
    "the low - density liquid ( ldl ) form of water and the high - density liquid ( hdl ) coexist along a first - order phase separation line with negative slope in the pressure - temperature @xmath3@xmath0 phase diagram and terminate in a liquid - liquid critical point ( llcp ) .",
    "the llcp scenario has been confirmed by simulations with various water models  @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of the llcp has been rationalized with different theoretical models by assuming ( a ) the anticorrelation between energy and volume in the h ( hydrogen ) bonds formation and ( b ) the possibility of forming different kinds of h bonds .",
    "an example is the thermodynamic free energy model of poole _",
    "et al . _  that hypothesizes the formation of strong h bonds when a geometrical condition on the molar volume is satisfied @xcite .",
    "another example is the microscopic cell model introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and studied in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the correlation between the h bonds , due to the o - o - o interaction , is incorporated . in this model",
    "the liquid - liquid ( ll ) phase transition is due to the tetrahedral ordering at low @xmath0 and @xmath3 of the h bonds , as explained in the following section .",
    "the llcp is predicted to lie in a region of the @xmath3@xmath0 phase diagram where the freezing of bulk water is inevitable .",
    "therefore , direct experimental verification of the llcp scenario is challenging .",
    "however , soper and ricci in 2000 showed with neutron diffraction measurements that the local arrangement of water molecules changes up to the second shell , increasing the local density when @xmath3 is increased from 26  mpa to 400  mpa at -5.15@xmath11c @xcite .",
    "this structural change was initially observed by varying @xmath0 from about 263  k to 313  k in x - ray structure factor experiments for heavy water d@xmath17o in 1983 @xcite .",
    "the data show that by decreasing @xmath0 the average o - o - o angle increases toward the tetrahedral angle 109.47@xmath11 @xcite . this result has been reaffirmed by ricci _",
    "_ in a recent experiment @xcite .    _ the critical point free scenario_. another scenario that hypothesizes a liquid - liquid ( ll ) phase transition has been considered recently @xcite . in this scenario",
    "the ll first order phase transition extends to negative @xmath3 and merges the liquid spinodal , but without a critical point .",
    "a rationalization of this scenario has been recently proposed on the basis of the microscopic cell model for water @xcite , showing that this scenario has a liquid spinodal that reenters from negative to positive @xmath3 @xcite .    _",
    "the stability limit scenario . _",
    "the reentrant spinodal discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite was earlier proposed in the stability limit scenario @xcite as the origin of the anomalies of water .",
    "although in the initial formulation of the stability limit scenario the occurrence of the ll phase transition was not hypothesized , it was successively introduced for thermodynamic consistency @xcite and found also in the thermodynamic free energy model of poole _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "_ the singularity free scenario_. this scenario assumes that the h - bonds linking molecules are uncorrelated . under this hypothesis ,",
    "water anomalies are the effect of the negative volume - entropy cross fluctuations @xcite and the large increase of response functions seen in the experiments represents only an apparent singularity , due to local density fluctuations . the regions with different local density do not form separate phases .",
    "a pressure increase gives rise to a sharp , but continuous , increase of density , as in the supercritical region of the llcp scenario .",
    "the continuous structural change is found also in _ ab initio _",
    "water simulations @xcite at very high pressure , @xmath18  mpa , and @xmath19  k. this scenario is recovered by the microscopic cell model @xcite in the limiting case of no cooperativity among the h bonds .",
    "the singularity - free scenario , in the region accessible by experiments , reproduces the same phase diagram as the scenarios with coexistence of two liquids .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to understand if there are oberservable differences among these scenarios . in particular , recent experiments and simulations , described in the next sections , have analyzed the case of the dynamics of water surrounding proteins or confined in nanopores , interpreting the experimental results within the context of the different scenarios .",
    "recent experiments on surface water and water hydrating proteins @xcite have shown that liquid water exists at temperatures as low as @xmath20c @xcite at ambient pressure . at these extremely low temperatures",
    "interesting dynamical phenomena occur @xcite , suggesting a possible relation for the dynamics of the biological macromolecules with that of the surrounding water @xcite .    at low @xmath0 , proteins exist in a ( `` glassy '' ) state with no conformational flexibility and with very low biological activity . for hydrated proteins above about 220  k , the flexibility is restored , allowing the sampling of more conformational sub - states .",
    "hence , the protein becomes biologically active at these temperatures .",
    "this dynamical transition is common to many biopolymers and is believed to be triggered by the strong coupling with the mobility of the hydration water @xcite , which shows a similar dynamical transition at about the same @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "by studying the translational correlation time of water molecules hydrating a lysozyme protein @xcite , dna @xcite and rna @xcite , found that at about 220  k the dynamics of hydration water changes from non - arrhenius at high @xmath0 to arrhenius at low @xmath0 . by definition a correlation time @xmath1 has an arrhenius behavior when @xmath21 \\label{eqarr}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the correlation time in the high-@xmath0 limit , @xmath23 is a @xmath0-independent activation energy and @xmath24 is the boltzmann constant . on the other hand , @xmath1 is non - arrhenius when its behavior can not be fitted with the expression in eq .",

    "@xcite calculated the local tetrahedral order parameter @xmath30 @xcite for hydration water surrounding lysozyme and dna and found that the rate of increase of @xmath30 has a maximum at @xmath31  k , the same temperature of the crossover in the behavior of mean square fluctuations .",
    "finally , they found that the diffusivity of hydration water exhibits a dynamic crossover from non - arrhenius to arrhenius behavior at the crossover temperature @xmath32  k for lysozyme and @xmath33  k for dna .",
    "note that @xmath34 is much higher than the glass transition temperature , estimated for tip5p as @xmath35k @xcite .",
    "thus this crossover is not likely to be related to the glass transition in water .",
    "therefore , the fact that @xmath36 is evidence of the correlation between the changes in protein fluctuations and the hydration water thermodynamics and structure . before analyzing in more details this relation , is worth considering the results of experiments about water confined in nanostructures .",
    "the non - arrhenius to arrhenius dynamic crossover has been found also in water confined in 20  mcm-41 silica pores . in 2004 , indeed , faraone _ et al .",
    "_ found the crossover for confined water at @xmath37  k by studying the structural relaxation time by neutron scattering  @xcite .",
    "this result was reinforced by the neutron magnetic resonance measurements of mallamace _ et al .",

    "in 2005 , liu _",
    "@xcite showed that , by increasing the pressure , the dynamic crossover of water confined in 20  mcm-41 silica pores disappears at pressure between 1200 and 1600 bar .",
    "@xcite , by using simulations of tip5p , st2 water and other models for liquids with the llcp , showed that the disappearing of the dynamic crossover of water can be associated to the presence of the llcp ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the simulations for water , indeed , display the same phenomenology of the experiments , with a crossover in the diffusion coefficient at @xmath3 below the ll critical pressure @xmath40 , and with no crossover at @xmath41 .",
    "@xcite presented numerical evidences that the crossover at @xmath40 is associated to the structural change occurring at the temperature of the maximum of the specific heat @xmath42 along a line departing from the llcp and extending in the one - phase region of the @xmath3@xmath0 phase diagram .",
    "this line , close to the llcp , coincides with the widom line @xcite , defined as the locus of the maximum correlation length in the one - phase region .",
    "xu _ et al . _",
    "@xcite interpreted the absence of the crossover in the diffusion coefficient at @xmath41 as a consequence of the fact that the hdl - to - ldl spinodal occurs at almost constant @xmath43 for decreasing @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , when cooled at @xmath41 , water never crosses the hdl - to - ldl spinodal and does not undergo the structural change responsible for the dynamic crossover .",
    "hence , although the origin of the crossover has different interpretations @xcite , the experimental and numerical evidences suggest that the change in the dynamics is triggered by a local rearrangement of the h bond network @xcite .",
    "experiments and simulations , however , can not give a definitive answer due to their finite resolution .",
    "for this reason is interesting to analyze the dynamic crossover of supercooled water within the framework of a hamiltonian cell model that allows simulations and analytic calculations @xcite .",
