    "web archives , such as the internet archive @xcite , make best effort attempts to archive all or parts of the world wide web .",
    "although these archiving efforts are easily viewed as the virtual analog of a traditional library that collects books and periodicals , the differences between archiving the products of printing presses and archiving the pages of the web are many .",
    "this report focuses on the web archiving impact of a critical difference between composite physical and web products : when composition occurs .",
    "when a book or magazine is produced , the text , images , and other resources are collected and composed into a product by the publisher .",
    "although future editions may use updated versions of the resources , a particular copy archived by a library is forever unchanging .",
    "future library patrons , when viewing the copy , need not consider if the copy currently in their hands changed after it was produced . thus , archiving physical media is deterministic from both the library s and patron s perspective .",
    "in contrast to a book , web pages are composed much later in the production process : when it is viewed .",
    "returning to a library book , it is as if the book s photographs were not included until after the book is opened .",
    "web archives generally capture web resources using web crawlers such as heritrix @xcite . due to resource constraints ( e.g. , network bandwidth ) and `` politeness '' considerations ( not unduly burdening original resource servers ) ,",
    "archive crawls seldom capture a web page and its component resources simultaneously .",
    "spaniol et al .",
    "@xcite note that crawls may span hours or days , increasing the risk of temporal incoherence because resources may change during the crawl .",
    "therefore , archiving composite web resources in a coherent state is probabilistic instead of deterministic .",
    "still , when an archived composite resource is presented in a web browser , it is labeled with the singular datetime of the root resource , as circled in figure [ f : webpage : spread ] .",
    "most users would consider the presentation a coherent representation of the composite resource as it existed at that displayed datetime .",
    "however , the capture datetime of the embedded resources can vary greatly .",
    "figure [ f : webpage : spread ] also shows the capture deltas for five embedded resources for an archived wunderground.org forecast page that was captured by the internet archive on 2004 - 12 - 09 19:09:26z .",
    "the yellow rectangles indicate the capture deltas .",
    "negative means captured before the root ; positive , after the root .",
    "note the _ clear weather _ satellite image that was captured + 9 months after the root .",
    "contrast it with the _ chance of rain _ and _ mostly cloudy _",
    "images captured just 10 hours after the root .",
    "this disagreement reveals a temporal incoherence ",
    "specifically , the satellite image is _ prima facie violative_.    in our research data , it is common for the temporal spread between the oldest and newest captures to be weeks or months .",
    "unexpected though was the discovery of many composite resources with spreads exceeding one year .",
    "even more unexpected were spreads exceeding five years ; a few even exceed ten years .",
    "spaniol et al .",
    "@xcite , denev @xcite , and ben saad et al .",
    "@xcite all introduce strategies to improve the quality of future web crawler - based captures .",
    "if implemented , these strategies should reduce spread in new captures .",
    "in contrast , our work focuses on the quality of existing holdings , without the benefit of improved crawl strategies .",
    "our investigation into the causes and consequences of temporal spread has revealed two important things about embedded resources :    * even if captured within seconds of the root resources , embedded resources are not always temporally coherent . * even if captured much later than the root resource , embedded resources are not necessarily incoherent .",
    "evaluation of temporal coherence depends on capture datetime , last modified datetime , and content differences .",
    "together , these attributes form patterns which can be considered prima facie coherent , prima facie violative , possibly coherent , and probably violative . in order to facilitate reasoning about temporal coherence , we catalog embedded resource coherence patterns and the conditions that differentiate them .",
    "the terminology used in this report comes primarily from the memento framework @xcite , which enables time - based http access to archived resources .",
    "the following definitions are from rfc 7089 @xcite :    original resource : :    an original resource is a resource that exists or used to exist , and    for which access to one of its prior states may be required . memento : :    a memento for an original resource is a resource that encapsulates a    prior state of the original resource .",
    "a memento for an original    resource as it existed at time t is a resource that encapsulates the    state the original resource had at time t. memento - datetime : :    the `` memento - datetime '' response header is used by a server to    indicate that a response reflects a prior state of an original    resource .",
    "its value expresses the datetime of that state .",

    "these are open questions , the answers to which may depend on circumstances and the user priorities .",
    "occasionally , an archive will have multiple mementos with the same .",
    "there are many causes ; three are briefly described here .",
    "first , several archives can capture the same original resource at the same time .",
    "if a client later uses multiple archives simultaneously , multiple mementos with the same will be found .",
    "second , a single capture is available from multiple archives because the archives share holdings ( e.g. , archive - it ! and the internet archive ) . in both of these cases",
    ", the content is likely to be identical ; however , metadata differences may exist ( e.g. , one archive captures datetime and the other does not ) .",
    "it is therefore possible for more than one pattern to be matched . in this case , we suggest using the least favorable coherence state . however , like the missing mementos issue , the best response to this condition may depend on user priorities .",
    "a third scenario that leads to collisions is typified by wikipedia edit wars @xcite . in this case , changes occur less than one second apart . because inherits one - second resolution from http , the resulting mementos can have the same .",
    "the internet archive wayback machine makes every effort to fulfill requests for embedded mementos . in some cases",
    "this means redirecting to a live web resource . in our research",
    ", we detect this redirection and treat the uri - r as if it has no mementos .",
    "we have introduced temporal coherence patterns of embedded mementos and four coherence states : prima facie coherent , possibly coherent , probably violative , and prima facie violative .",
