    "nowadays , it is widely believed that qcd is the most promising theory to explain the strong interactions . however , due the property of confinement and asymptotic freedom we can accept and study the quarks as free only at very high energies .",
    "this much expected phase , which is called quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) , is under investigation in rhic experiments and there is strong evidence that it has been observed .",
    "according to heinz @xcite it seems that elliptic flow at high enough collision energies is a qgp signature .",
    "the recent results from rhic experiments have attracted many attempts for theoretical models to be tested@xcite .",
    "recently there are also a lot of attempts to study the phases of qcd from first principles using lattice techniques at finite baryon density and chemical isospin potential .",
    "there is , however , an alternative approach which applies only in the low energy regime .",
    "following this path , it is necessary to use a variety of effective phenomenological models and qcd  like theories in order to mimic some of the features of qcd .",
    "a quite popular model , which fulfils these requirements , exhibiting many of the symmetries observed in qcd , is the linear sigma model .",
    "the model was first introduced in the 1960s as a model for pion  nucleon interactions @xcite and has attracted much attention recently , especially in studies involving disoriented chiral condensates @xcite . the linear sigma model with a @xmath1 symmetry and two to four quark flavors",
    "have been studied in the hartree - fock or hartree approximation@xcite within the cornwall  jackiw  tomboulis ( cjt ) formalism@xcite , and the large - n approximation of the linear sigma model has been investigated by using the same formlism in refs@xcite . within the same framework ,",
    "shu and li @xcitehave studied bose - einstein condensation and the chiral phase transition in the chiral limit , and they introduced the chemical potential through the third component of isospin charge . in this discussion , we apply a mechanism @xcite to include the isospin chemical potential in the linear sigma model , then by using cjt method , we study the chiral phase transition at finite isospin chemical potential in explicit chiral symmetry breaking .    the organization of this paper is as follows . in the next section we present the basics about the linear sigma model and",
    "how this model incorporates some of the basic features of qcd , then we introduce the isospin chemical potential in the model . in section  [ section : veff ]",
    "we calculate the effective potential of the model by using the cornwall  jackiw  tomboulis method of composite operators and obtain a set of gap equations for the thermal effective mass of the pions .",
    "the solution of these gap equations is presented in section  [ section : numerical ] . in the last section we present our conclusions .",
    "consider an idealisation of qcd with two species of massless quarks @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the lagrangian of strong interaction physics is invariant under @xmath4 chiral transformation @xmath5 where @xmath6 .",
    "however this chiral symmetry does not appear in the low energy particle spectrum since it is spontaneously broken .",
    "consequently , three goldstone bosons , the pions , appear and the ( constituent ) quarks become massive . at low energy , the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry can be described by an effective theory , the linear sigma model , which involves the massless pions @xmath7 and a massive @xmath8 particle . here , the @xmath9 field can be used to represent the quark condensate which is considered as the order parameter of the chiral phase transition .",
    "this choice is a natural one since both exhibit the same behaviour under chiral transformations .",
    "the pions are very light particles and can be considered approximately as massless goldstone bosons .",
    "there are different ways to write down the lagrangian of the linear sigma model and each with certain advantages and disadvantages .",
    "one version which demonstrates the chiral properties of this lagrangian in a straightforward way involves the introduction of a matrix field @xmath10 defined as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the unity matrix and @xmath13 are the pauli matrix .",
    "this matrix field satisfies the normalization condition @xmath14 . under @xmath4 chiral transformations , @xmath15 transforms as @xmath16 using this parametrisation the renormalizable effective lagrangian of the linear sigma model can be written as @xcite",

    "it results in a massive sigma particle @xmath8 and three massless goldstone bosons @xmath7 , as well as giving a mass @xmath22 to the constituent quarks .",
    "now let us consider the lagrangian of the linear sigma model for two massless quarks of flavors @xmath2 , @xmath3 with different chemical potential @xmath23 and @xmath24 , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the matrix of chemical potentials .",
    "the term @xmath27 can be expressed either by the variables @xmath23 , @xmath24 or by the two combinations @xmath28 and @xmath29 , which couple to the baryon charge density and the third component of isospin respectively .",
    "then we have @xmath30 both @xmath31 and @xmath32 are @xmath33 invariant , but the symmetry is reduced by the baryon charge density term @xmath34 to @xmath21 and further reduced by the isospin term @xmath35 to @xmath36 . in what follows , we consider an idealized case where @xmath37 is nonzero while @xmath38 .",
    "a similar choice is adopted in refs.@xcite@xcite . according to their analysis such an approximation",
    "is justified by the fact that we are dealing with the dynamics of strong interactions . in any realistic",
    "setting , @xmath39 .",
    "such a system is unstable due to weak decays which do not conserve isospin .",
    "we can still imagine that all relatively slow electroweak effects are turned off .",
    "we note that the effects of the isospin chemical potential @xmath37 can be included to the lagrangian of the linear sigma model without additional phenomenological parameters by promoting @xmath33 to a local gauge symmetry and viewing @xmath37 as the zeroth component of a gauge potential @xcite .",
