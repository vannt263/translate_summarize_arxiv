    "the target space of the @xmath2 supersymmetric non - linear sigma model ( nl@xmath0 m ) , with eight supercharges , must be hyperkhler @xcite . by using this fact ,",

    "this contribution has two main concerns , the first is the construction of the metric and khler potential on the higgs branch of @xmath2 supersymmetric gauge theories with @xmath13 gauge groups@xcite .    the second motive is concerned with @xmath0 model lumps , or @xmath0 model instantons . a lump solution was first found in the @xmath14 sigma model , or the @xmath15 model @xcite .",

    "gauge theories coupled to several higgs fields often admit semi - local vortex - strings @xcite . in the strong gauge coupling limit , the gauge theories reduce to nl@xmath0ms and in this limit , semi - local strings reduce to lump - strings . in the gauge theories at finite couplings , the large distance behavior of semi - local strings is well approximated by lump solutions .",
    "it was demonstrated in ref .   that non - abelian semi - local strings@xcite in a @xmath7 gauge theory reduce to the grassmann lumps at large distance .",

    "the added term breaks the complexified gauge transformations down to @xmath68 and the equations of motion for @xmath62 gives the constraint ( [ sbg : eq : v ] ) which reduces the khler potential ( [ sbg : eq : so_usp_kahler ] ) back to .",

    "we show in ref .",
    "that @xmath90 in the @xmath4 case , with a decomposition of the meson @xmath73 , we can completely reconstruct @xmath65 modulo @xmath91 transformations .",

    "therefore we have to take the degrees of freedom of the baryons into account to consider the full higgs phase @xmath97    for large @xmath98 , it is a hard task to obtain an explicit metric from the formula ( [ sbg : eq : kahler_so , usp_n=1 ] ) , since we need to calculate the eigenvalues of @xmath99 . in ref .",
    "we calculate explicitly an expansion of the khler potential around its vacuum value from which we are able to obtain the metric and curvature .",

    ". we succeeded in constructing the hyperkhler quotient of @xmath131 and @xmath19 thanks to the fact that @xmath132 is in the anti - fundamental representation , which is the same representation as @xmath65 .",
    "although , we want to make use of the same strategy for @xmath100 and @xmath133 as before , @xmath134 still has charge @xmath135 with respect to the the @xmath5 gauge symmetry while @xmath65 has @xmath5 charge @xmath136 .",
    "therefore , it is not an easy task to construct the @xmath137 and @xmath130 hyperkhler quotients .",
    "in this section , we will study the @xmath0 model lumps which are 1/2 bps states .",
    "lumps are stringy topological defects in @xmath138 dimensional spacetime and are supported by the non - trivial homotopy group @xmath139 associated with a holomorphic mapping from the 2 dimensional spatial plane @xmath140 to the target space of the nl@xmath0ms @xcite .",
    "let us concentrate on @xmath141 khler quotient models as nl@xmath0ms . in these cases , ( inhomogeneous )",
    "complex coordinates on the khler manifold @xmath142 , which are the lowest scalar components of the chiral superfields , are given by some set of holomorphic @xmath143 invariants ; @xmath144 modulo @xmath145 , @xmath146 .",
    "lump solutions can be obtained by just imposing @xmath147 to be a holomorphic function with respect to @xmath148 @xmath149 where @xmath150 denote complex constants .",
    "the mass of the lumps can be obtained by plugging the solution back into the lagrangian @xmath151    we would like to stress that all the parameters @xmath150 are nothing but the moduli parameters of the 1/2 bps lumps .",
    "we assume that the boundary i.e.  @xmath152 is mapped to a point @xmath153 on the vacuum manifold in a lump solution .",
    "since the functions @xmath154 should be single valued , @xmath154 can be expressed with a finite number of poles as @xmath155 strictly speaking , we have to change patches of the manifold at the poles in order to describe the solutions correctly . to pick up such global information of lumps thoroughly , it is convenient to use the holomorphic invariants @xmath144 as homogeneous coordinates . by fixing some components of @xmath144 to be constants , we can construct the invariants @xmath144 in terms of @xmath154 and find that @xmath144 also be holomorphic functions @xmath156 .",
    "we can redefine the functions @xmath157 by using @xmath145 transformations @xmath158 , such that all the invariants @xmath157 are polynomials @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the @xmath5 charge of the holomorphic invariant @xmath144 and @xmath161 .",
    "these polynomials are basic tools to study lump solutions and their moduli , and @xmath154 can be written as ratios of these polynomials , which are known as rational maps in the abelian case .",
    "here we assume that the invariants @xmath157 have no common zeroes , in order to fix @xmath145 , @xmath162 .",
    "if a common zero accidentally emerges by varying the moduli parameters , the behavior of lumps can not be defined from the view point of the nl@xmath0 m , since a common zero corresponds to the coulomb phase for @xmath5 in the original gauge theory .",
    "this can also be understood as the emergence of a local vortex ( see ref .   for details ) .",
    "using the so - called _ moduli matrix _ , which describes different bps solitons in supersymmetric gauge theories @xcite , we can indeed identify the lowest component @xmath147 with the moduli matrix .",
    "the key observation is that the gauge symmetry @xmath163 in the supersymmetric theory",
    "is naturally complexified : @xmath164 .",
    "hence , the moduli matrix naturally appears in the superfield formulation , while if we fix @xmath165 in the wess - zumino gauge , the scalar field @xmath44 appears as the usual bosonic component in the lagrangian .",
    "now we have a great advantage , thanks to the above superfield formulation of the nl@xmath0ms . a supersymmetric low energy effective theory of the 1/2 bps lumps",
    "is immediately obtained merely by plugging the 1/2 bps solution ( [ sbg : eq : lump_sol ] ) into the khler potential which we have obtained in the previous section after promoting the moduli parameters @xmath150 to fields on the lump world - volume @xmath166 the resulting ( effective ) expression for the khler potential is @xmath167",
    "let us start with a very simple example of a theory with the gauge group @xmath168 and only two flavors @xmath169 .",
    "the target space is@xcite @xmath170 .",
    "lump solutions are classified by a pair of integers @xmath171 and @xmath172 where @xmath173 denote integers . a solution with @xmath171 lumps",
    "is given by @xmath174 where @xmath175 are holomorphic functions of @xmath148 of degree @xmath176 , respectively .",
    "the energy reads @xmath177 interestingly , the tension of the minimal lump @xmath178 is half of @xmath179 which is that of the minimal lump in the usual @xmath15 model .",
    "we would now like to consider lump configurations in slightly more complicated models by considering general @xmath180 khler quotients , where we set @xmath181 , @xmath182 and @xmath183 .",
    "however , we should take into account the following constraint on the holomorphic invariants of the @xmath180 group for @xmath184 lump configurations @xcite @xmath185 as an example for @xmath186 , we take @xmath187 this choice of diagonal matrices allows us to treat the invariants as if they where simply invariants of @xmath73 different @xmath43 subgroups . note that non - zero parameters @xmath188 keep the @xmath189 even at @xmath190 .",
    "thus , the khler potential in becomes @xmath191 the corresponding energy density is obtained by calculating @xmath192 with this potential .",
    "if we take some @xmath188 to vanish , the energy density becomes singular at @xmath190 @xmath193\\sim   { \\rm const.}\\times \\frac{1}{|z - z_i|}+{\\cal o}\\left((z - z_i)^0\\right)\\ , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is due to the occurrence of a curvature singularity in the manifold when @xmath194 .",
    "the trace part of @xmath195 determines the overall size of the configuration and the trace part of @xmath196 the center of mass , where only the latter turns out to be a normalizable mode@xcite .",
    "we have studied the nl@xmath0 m lumps in gauge theories with @xmath125 , @xmath197 , @xmath198 and @xmath199 gauge groups and obtained khler metrics and for the two first cases also the hyperkhler metrics .",
