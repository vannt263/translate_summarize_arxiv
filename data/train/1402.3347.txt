    "electronic relaxation rates contain important information about the excitations in a metallic system .",
    "the single - particle relaxation rate , @xmath1 , determines the lifetime of quasi - particles as well as the thermal conductivity @xmath2 ; the transport relaxation rate , @xmath3 , the electrical conductivity via the drude formula @xmath4 . here",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath6 are the conduction electron effective mass and number density , respectively , @xmath7 is the fermi velocity , and @xmath8 is the specific heat .",
    "there are various contributions to these relaxation rates , including those from the scattering of electrons by propagating , or particle - like , excitations .",
    "for instance , the coupling of longitudinal phonons to conduction electrons leads to the well - known bloch @xmath9-behavior of the electrical resistivity ; the corresponding effect in the single - particle relaxation rate is a @xmath10-law.@xcite in magnetically ordered phases , the coupling of the conduction electrons to any magnetic goldstone modes contributes to the relaxation rates . in isotropic",
    "heisenberg ferromagnets , the goldstone modes are the ferromagnons with a frequency - momentum relation @xmath11 .",
    "they have been found to contribute a @xmath0 term to the transport relaxation rate.@xcite in helimagnets,@xcite which have a helically modulated magnetic ground state , the corresponding goldstone mode ( the helimagnon ) has been shown to lead to a term in the electrical resistivity that is proportional to @xmath12 in the low - temperature limit.@xcite in antiferromagnets , the corresponding contribution is known to be proportional to @xmath10.@xcite these results all hold for three - dimensional systems , which is the only physical dimension in which long - range magnetic order exists . for later reference",
    "we note , however , that the various power laws quoted above are dimensionality dependent .",
    "for instance , in a generic dimension @xmath13 the contribution from ferromagnons to the resistivity is proportional to @xmath14 .",
    "in addition to the scattering by propagating excitations , there are contributions to the transport coefficients due to excitations with a continuous spectrum .",
    "the best known example is the one due to the coulomb interaction between the electrons . in simple metals",
    "it leads to a @xmath0 contribution to both the single - particle rate and the transport rate , i.e. , a lower power than the phonon contribution .",
    "however , since the relevant energy scale is the fermi energy @xmath15 or fermi temperature @xmath16 ( we use units such that @xmath17 ) , which is much larger than the debye temperature , this dominates the phonon contribution only at very low temperatures.@xcite in metals that display ferromagnetism the latter statement is not necessarily true , due to fermi surfaces that consist of multiple sheets , and the issue of both the temperature dependence and the prefactor of the coulomb contribution to the electrical resistivity is complicated .",
    "these are old questions@xcite that recently have been revisited in the context of quantum criticality and exotic metals.@xcite another example is the scattering of electrons in ferromagnets by both longitudinal magnetization fluctuations and the so - called stoner excitations in the transverse channel.@xcite the latter are dissipative , non - hydrodynamic transverse excitations in addition to the propagating spin waves . in a random - phase approximation ,",
    "the contribution to the resistivity from these dissipative excitations , both longitudinal and transverse , was shown in ref .   to result in a @xmath0 behavior with a prefactor that is inversely proportional to the magnetization .",
    "this is qualitatively the same behavior these authors found for the scattering by magnons , and it agrees roughly with the trend observed in fe , co , and ni.@xcite as we will see , this conclusion , as far as the magnons is concerned , is true only in a temperature window , but not at asymptotically low temperature .",
    "it should be stressed , however , that this similarity is somewhat accidental and approximation dependent even in the regime where it holds .",
    "for instance , the power law of the magnon contribution is dimensionality dependent , as mentioned above , while the contribution from the dissipative excitations is not .",
    "also , the prefactor of the former is essentially determined by the dispersion relation of the magnons , which is governed by very general principles , whereas the latter is dependent on many non - universal details .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that various contributions of very different nature to the relaxation rates show a @xmath0 temperature dependence makes the interpretation of the experimentally observed @xmath0 behavior of the electrical resistivity in many ferromagnetic materials difficult.@xcite at the same time , the electrical resistivity is a basic physical property that is very useful , for instance , for tracking and identifying magnetic phase transitions,@xcite and establishing its behavior in the ferromagnetic phase as a benchmark is important .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the magnon contribution to the relaxation rates in ferromagnets and show that for this process the established result is qualitatively incorrect at asymptotically low temperatures ; instead of a @xmath0 temperature dependence , the magnon contributions to both the electrical resistivity and the thermal resistivity display an exponential behavior .",
    "a problem with the established ferromagnetic result was first noted in ref .",
    ", which showed that the results for the helimagnetic and ferromagnetic cases are not mutually consistent : if one considers the ferromagnetic limit of the helimagnetic ground state , by letting the wavelength of the helix go to infinity , one finds that the leading contribution to the relaxation rate , which would yield a power law , vanishes .",
    "what is left behind is an exponential behavior of the form@xcite 1/ _ ( t^2/)(-t_0/t )  , [ eq:1.1 ] where the temperature scale @xmath18 depends on the conduction band splitting or `` stoner gap '' @xmath19 or , equivalently , the magnetization,@xcite and on the fermi energy @xmath15 .",
    "this result is surprising , given that the relaxation rates due to magnetic goldstone modes in both helimagnets and antiferromagnets show a power - law behavior .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to discuss this problem , and to elaborate on the brief remarks that were given in appendix d of ref .  .",
    "we will show that the asymptotic low - temperature behavior of both the transport relaxation rates due to magnons is indeed exponential of the form shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1.1 ] ) , with @xmath20 with @xmath21 the spin - wave stiffness , which itself depends on @xmath19 , and @xmath22 and @xmath15 the fermi wave number and fermi energy , respectively .",
    "this result holds in an asymptotic regime defined by @xmath23 .",
    "however , in a sizable pre - asymptotic temperature window given by @xmath24 one recovers the @xmath0 behavior found previously .",
    "the reason for the exponential asymptotic result is the fact that , in a ferromagnet , the goldstone modes are purely transverse , and therefore couple only quasi - particles in different stoner bands .",
    "the effective electron - electron - interaction due to ferromagnon exchange therefore describes purely inter - stoner - band scattering , which leads to an activated process .",
    "in contrast , in helimagnets and antiferromagnets there is an intra - stoner - band coupling which leads to a power law .",
    "this vanishes as the characteristic wave number of the magnetic order goes to zero in the ferromagnetic limit .    these results are valid for all metallic ferromagnets , whether or not the magnetism is caused by the conduction electrons themselves or by localized electrons in a different band .",
    "we will refer to such systems as `` itinerant ferromagnets '' and `` localized - moment ferromagnetes '' , respectively . in the main body of the paper we will consider a very general model that does not depend",
    "on which of these two cases is realized , and that uses only very general properties of ferromagnets that follow from symmetry arguments . a more specific stoner - type model for the case of itinerant ferromagnets",

    "one consequence of this is that the electron - electron scattering contribution to the electrical resistivity is likely much larger than a single - band model would imply , and it has been suggested that it makes the largest contribution to the observed @xmath0 behavior at low temperatures.@xcite the reason is that different band edges have different distances from the common chemical potential , which in effect leads to different fermi temperatures . depending on whether or not the various scattering processes flip the electron spin , and whether or not they couple different sheets of the fermi surface , the relaxation rates or the relaxation times may be additive , which leads a complicated structure of the overall resistivity . in addition , there are the contributions from the dissipative spin excitations , which also are proportional to @xmath0.@xcite as a result , the low - temperature transport rate in fe , ni , and co is about 100 times larger than one would expect from the coulomb contribution in a single - band model with a single fermi temperature of about @xmath176k.@xcite @xmath67 , on the other hand , is largely unaffected by a complicated band structure : it is given by @xmath21 times the largest possible momentum transfer squared , see sec .",
