    "the concept of fidelity has been developed as a tool to characterize the stability of a quantum - mechanical system against perturbations @xcite . originally fidelity was introduced as the squared modulus of the overlap integral of a wave packet with itself after the development forth and back under the influence of two slightly different hamiltonians .",
    "let @xmath2 be the unperturbed hamiltonian and @xmath5 the perturbed one .",
    "this somewhat unusual definition of the perturbation strength @xmath6 has been applied for later convenience .",
    "then the fidelity is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the wave function at the beginning , often chosen as a gaussian wave packet with minimum uncertainty .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath2 has mean level spacing of one , and thus @xmath9 is given in units of the heisenberg time .",
    "the variance of the off - diagonal elements of @xmath10 is chosen to be one . in all what follows it",
    "is assumed that @xmath6 is of the order of one thus guaranteeing that the shift of the levels due to the parameter variation is of the order of the mean level spacing .",
    "depending on the strength of the perturbation one can discriminate roughly three regimes . in the perturbative regime , where the strength of the perturbation is small compared to the mean level spacing ,",
    "the decay of the fidelity is gaussian .",
    "as soon as the strength of the perturbation becomes of the order of the mean level spacing , a cross - over to exponential decay is observed , with a decay constant obtained from fermi s golden rule @xcite . for very strong perturbations",
    "the decay becomes independent of the strength of the perturbation . here",
    "the decay is still exponential , but now the decay constant is given by the classical lyapunov exponent @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed by pastawski @xcite to look for such a behaviour in a spin - echo experiment on isolated spins coupled weakly to a bath of surrounding spins @xcite .",
    "a paper of gorin @xcite is of particular relevance for the present work .",
    "the authors calculated the gaussian average of the fidelity amplitude in the regime of small perturbations using the linear - response approximation , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is given by @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the spectral form factor .",
    "@xmath15 is the universality index , i.e. @xmath16 for the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) , @xmath17 for the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) , and @xmath18 for the gaussian symplectic ensemble ( gse ) . for an explicit calculation knowledge of the spectral form factor",
    "is thus sufficient . by an exponentiation of the above formula ,",
    "@xmath19 the authors were able to describe the cross - over from gaussian to exponential decay with increasing perturbation strength quantitatively .",
    "the lyapunov regime is non - universal and thus not accessible in a random matrix model .",
    "it is obvious that the linear - response approximation must break down for large perturbations . in the present work supersymmetry techniques",
    "are applied to calculate the ensemble average of the fidelity decay . since this calculation is non - perturbative ,",
    "the results hold for arbitrary values of the perturbation strength .",
    "we shall see that the calculation reveals an important generic feature , which is unaccessible by any perturbative approach .",
    "in the present paper we shall discuss the ensemble average of the _ fidelity amplitude _",
    ", since for this quantity the calculation is much easier than for the originally introduced quantity ( [ 00 ] ) .",
    "since both the unperturbed hamiltonian and the perturbation are taken from the gaussian ensembles , the choice of the initial wave packet @xmath8 is irrelevant . the ensemble average may thus be written as @xmath20\\right>\\,,\\ ] ] where it is assumed that the hamiltonian has been truncated to a finite rank @xmath21 .",
    "the hamiltonian introduced in equation ( [ 000 ] ) has the disadvantage that the mean density of states changes with @xmath6",
    ". the more it is somewhat inconvenient for the present calculation that the variances of the matrix elements of @xmath2 and @xmath10 differ .",
    "we therefore adopt a slightly different parameter variation , @xmath22 it is assumed that the matrix elements of @xmath2 and @xmath23 have the same variance , have zero average , @xmath24 , are uncorrelated , @xmath25 , and are gaussian distributed , @xmath26 where @xmath27    from random matrix theory it is known that the corresponding ensemble averaged density of states is given by wigner s semi - circle law with a value of one in the centre of the circle , @xmath28 ( see e.g. reference @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting variances of the matrix elements of @xmath2 and @xmath23 are given by @xmath29 it follows for the gue @xmath30_{kl}^*[h_{\\phi_1}]_{kl}\\right>=\\frac{n}{\\pi^2 }    \\cos\\left(\\phi_2-\\phi_1\\right)\\,.\\ ] ] a similar expression is obtained for the goe . since only the difference of @xmath31 and @xmath32 enters expression ( [ 00 g ] ) , we may assume without loss of generality @xmath33 .",
