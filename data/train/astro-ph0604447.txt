    "one of the most important outstanding problems in cosmological structure formation is how and when the universe was reionized .",
    "observational constraints such as the thomson scattering optical depth to the last scattering surface ( kogut et al .",
    "2003 ; page et al .",
    "2006 ) from the large - angle polarization anisotropy in the cmb detected by _",
    "wmap _ and the intergalactic , hydrogen ly@xmath7 absorption spectra of high - redshift quasars ( e.g. , becker et al .",
    "2001 ) provide crucial constraints on the theory of cosmic reionization and the structure formation which caused it during the early epochs that have thus far escaped direct observation .",
    "the _ wmap _ first - year data implied an electron scattering optical depth , @xmath8 , which seemed surprisingly large at the time , since it was well in excess of the value , @xmath9 , for an intergalactic medium ( igm ) abrubtly ionized at @xmath10 , the reionization epoch which had been suggested by quasar measurements of the gunn - peterson ( gunn & peterson 1965 ; `` gp '' ) effect . in order for such an abrupt reionization to explain the high value of 0.17 observed by _",
    "wmap _ for @xmath5 , in fact , @xmath2 is required .",
    "this presented a puzzle for the theory of reionization : how was reionization so advanced , so _",
    "early _ in our observed @xmath11cdm universe , and",
    "yet so _ extended _ in time as to accumulate the high @xmath5 observed by wmap , while _ ending _ as late as @xmath12 to satisfy the quasar spectral constraints ?",
    "this stimulated widespread speculation regarding the efficiency for the formation of the early stars and/or miniquasars which were the sources of reionization , as well as for the escape of their ionizing photons into the igm ( e.g. , haiman & holder 2003 ; cen 2003 ; wyithe & loeb 2003 ; kaplinghat et al .",
    "2003 ; sokasian et al . 2004 ; ciardi , ferrara , & white 2003 ; ricotti & ostriker 2004 ) .",
    "a general consensus emerged that the efficiencies for photon production and escape associated with present - day star formation were not adequate to explain the early reionization implied by the high @xmath5 value , given the rate of early structure formation expected in the @xmath11cdm universe .",
    "common to most attempts to explain the high @xmath5 was the assumption that early star formation favored massive population iii stars , either in `` minihalos , '' with virial temperatures @xmath13 k , requiring that @xmath14 molecules cool the gas to enable star formation ( abel , bryan , & norman 2002 ; bromm , coppi , & larson 2002 ) , or else in larger halos with @xmath15  k , for which atomic hydrogen cooling is possible , instead .",
    "a high efficiency for turning halo baryons into stars and a high escape fraction for the ionizing radiation into the igm were generally required as well .",
    "several effects were suggested that could extend the reionization epoch , too , including the rising impact of small - scale structure as a sink of ionizing photons ( e.g. , shapiro , iliev , & raga 2004 ; iliev , shapiro , & raga 2005 ; iliev , scannapieco , & shapiro 2005 ) , the suppression of low - mass source - halo formation inside the growing intergalactic h  ii regions ( e.g. , haiman & holder 2003 ) , and a general decline of the efficiency for releasing ionizing radiation over time ( e.g. , cen 2003 ; choudhury & ferrara 2005 ) .    with three years of polarization data , _ wmap _ ( henceforth , `` wmap3 '' ) , has now produced a more accurate determination of @xmath5 , which revises the optical depth downward to @xmath1 ( page et al .",
    "this value is consistent with an abrupt reionization at @xmath16 , significantly later than that implied by the _ wmap _ first - year data ( henceforth , `` wmap1'' ) .",
    "it is natural to wonder if this implies that the high efficiency demanded of ionizing photon production by wmap1 , described above , can now be reduced , accordingly , to accommodate the later epoch of reionization determined by wmap3 . in",
    "what follows , we will show that this is not the case .",
    "structure formation in the @xmath11cdm universe with the primordial density fluctuation power spectrum measured by wmap3 is delayed relative to that in the wmap1 universe , especially on the small - scales responsible for the sources of reionization .",
    "this , by itself , is not surprising , since there was always a degeneracy inherent in measuring the amplitude of the primordial density fluctuations using the cmb temperature anisotropy alone , resulting from the unknown value of @xmath5 .",
    "higher values of @xmath5 , that is , imply higher amplitude density fluctuations to produce the same level of cmb anisotropy .",
    "this degeneracy is broken by the independent measurement of @xmath5 made possible by detecting the polarization anisotropy , as well .",
    "hence , when wmap3 revised the value of @xmath17 downward relative to wmap1 , so it revised downward the amplitude of the density fluctuations .",
    "this same decrease of @xmath5 implies a tilt away from the scale - invariant power spectrum , @xmath18 with @xmath19 , which lowers the density fluctuation amplitude on small scales more than on large scales .",
    "as we will show , this delays the structure formation which controls reionization by just the right amount such that , if reionization efficiencies were large enough to make reionization early and @xmath8 in the wmap1 universe , the same efficiencies will cause reionization to be later in the wmap3 universe and @xmath20 , as required .    in  2 , we compare the rate of structure formation in @xmath11cdm according to wmap1 and wmap3 , on the scales relevant to reionization . in  3 , we relate the history of reionization to the growth of the mass fraction collapsed into source halos , and use this to compare the reionization histories in wmap3 and wmap1 universes .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in  4 .",
    "we adopt cosmological parameters @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 ( spergel et al . 2003 ) and @xmath26 ( spergel et al .",
    "2006 ) for wmap1 and wmap3 , respectively .",
    "the most notable changes from old to new are : a reduction of normalization of the power spectrum on large scales ( @xmath27 ) and more `` tilt '' ( @xmath28 ) . throughout this paper ,",
    "we use the transfer function of eisenstein & hu ( 1999 ) .",
    "a fundamental building block of models of reionization is the fraction of the mass contained in virialized halos  the `` collapsed fraction ''  the sites of ionizing photon production and release . using the press - schechter formalism ( press & schechter 1974 )",
    ", this collapsed fraction is given by : @xmath29,\\ ] ] where @xmath30 $ ] , @xmath31 is the variance in the present - day matter density field according to linear perturbation theory , as filtered on the mass scale @xmath32 , @xmath33 is the linear growth factor ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 in the matter - dominated era ) , and @xmath36 is the minimum mass for collapsed objects . for studies of reionization , the minimum mass is typically parameterized in terms of the minimum virial temperature , @xmath37 , of halos capable of hosting ionizing sources , @xmath38^{3/2},$ ] + where @xmath39 for fully neutral gas ( iliev & shapiro 2001 )",
    ".    for @xmath11cdm , @xmath40 for @xmath41 is lower for wmap3 than for wmap1 by about 30 percent . during reionization ,",
    "when such halos are still rare , we expect their abundance to be exponentially suppressed by this factor .",
    "this is clearly shown in figure 1 , where the new halo abundance and collapsed fraction are lower than the old ones by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude .",
    "since the threshold for halo collapse scales at these redshifts as @xmath42 , structure formation on these mass scales is delayed by a factor @xmath43 in scale factor .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 2 , where we plot @xmath44 k ) versus redshift and show that the shift of 1.4 in scale factor provides an excellent description of the delay in structure formation which results .",
    "for the simplest possible reionization model , in which the universe is instantly and fully ionized at some redshift @xmath45 , the optical depth @xmath46 .",
    "if we assume that @xmath47 is a constant , so that reionization occurs when the collapsed fraction reaches some threshold value , then our simple estimate implies that the change in the cosmological parameters alone reduces @xmath5 by a factor of @xmath48 , from @xmath49 to @xmath50 . in the next section",
    "we discuss the motivation behind tying the reionization history to the collapsed fraction .",
    "an important quantity in the theory of cosmic reionization is the number of ionizing photons per hydrogen atom in the universe required to complete reionization . in the absence of recombinations ,",
    "this ratio is unity .",
    "given some observational constraint on the epoch of reionization , such as the onset of the gp effect at @xmath12 , we can deduce that at least one ionizing photon per atom had to have been released by that time .",
    "this ratio can then be used to predict other quantities , such as the associated metal enrichment of the universe ( e.g. , shapiro , giroux , & babul 1994 ) or the intensity of the near infrared background ( e.g. , santos , bromm , & kamionkowski 2002 ; fernandez & komatsu 2006 ) .",
    "most models of cosmic reionization link the ionized fraction of the igm to the fraction of matter in collapsed objects capable of hosting stars ( e.g. , shapiro , giroux , & babul 1994 ; chiu & ostriker 2000 ; wyithe & loeb 2003 ; haiman & holder 2003 ; furlanetto , zaldarriaga , & hernquist 2004 ; iliev et al . 2005 ; alvarez et al . 2006 ) . for a given model , reionization is complete whenever the total number of ionizing photons emitted per hydrogen atom reaches some threshold value .",
    "along with the escape fraction , star formation efficiency , and stellar initial mass function , the evolution of the collapsed fraction @xmath51 forms the basis for calculation of this ratio and thus the reionization history .    to relate @xmath5 to the halo abundance encoded in @xmath52 , it is necessary to determine the relationship between the reionization history and the collapsed fraction .",
    "if we assume every h atom which ends up in a collapsed halo releases on average @xmath53 ionizing photons , and that @xmath54 is the number of ionizing photons consumed per ionized h atom , then we can write a simple relation between @xmath52 and the mean ionized fraction , @xmath55 ( e.g. , furlanetto , zaldarriaga , & hernquist 2004 ) . for simplicity , we will assume a constant value , @xmath56 ( this simplification does not affect our main conclusions ) , and fix the value of @xmath57 for a given @xmath37 , so that @xmath8 for wmap1 .",
    "reionization is complete when the collapsed fraction reaches a threshold given by @xmath58 .    in figure 3",
    ", we plot the value of @xmath59 which corresponds to @xmath60  k. as mentioned in  2 , wmap3 implies a delay of structure formation by @xmath6 in scale factor . in the lower panel",
    ", we compare the reionization histories for wmap1 and wmap3 according to equation ( [ xe ] ) , for the same efficiency @xmath57 .",
    "the same shift by a factor 1.4 in scale factor is also present in the reionization histories , which is not surprising , since we have assumed that @xmath61 , and @xmath52 is a unique function of @xmath59 . as mentioned in  2",
    ", this change can account for a shift in the implied value of @xmath5 from 0.17 to 0.1 , quite close to the wmap3 value of @xmath62 .",
    "on the basis of this simple calculation , we conclude that the reduction of @xmath5 from wmap1 to wmap3 does not , itself , significantly reduce the demand for high efficiency of ionizing sources imposed previously by wmap1 .",
    "recombinations undoubtedly play an important role during reionization .",
    "to first approximation , they should determine by what amount the parameter @xmath54 appearing in equation ( [ xe ] ) exceeds unity .",
    "the quantity @xmath63 is equal to the average number of recombinations that all ionized atoms must undergo during reionization , @xmath64 . as shown by iliev et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , @xmath65 at percolation for large scale simulations of reionization that resolve all sources with masses greater than @xmath66 , but do not resolve clumping of the igm on scales smaller than @xmath67 comoving kpc .",
    "surely , smaller scale structure affects reionization strongly ( e.g. , iliev , shapiro , & raga 2005 ; iliev , scannapieco , & shapiro 2005 ) , and therefore the number of recombinations per ionized atom is likely to be higher .",
    "for example , alvarez , bromm , & shapiro ( 2006 ) found that the recombination time in the gas ionized by the end of the lifetime of a 100 @xmath68 star embedded in a @xmath69 halo at @xmath70 is @xmath71  myr , roughly one tenth of the age of the universe at that time .    at the high redshifts considered here , the ratio of the age of the universe to the recombination time is proportional to @xmath72 .",
    "since structure formation is later for wmap3 than for wmap1 by a factor of 1.4 in scale factor , photon consumption due to recombinations is lower for wmap3 by a factor @xmath73 .",
    "even if recombinations dominate the consumption of ionizing photons during reionization , therefore , the new _ wmap _ data require an efficiency @xmath57 which is at most a factor of only @xmath74 lower than that for the first year data .",
    "this is true even if clumping increases toward lower redshift , since the evolution of clumping follows structure formation and is , therefore , similarly delayed .",
    "we have shown that the new cosmological parameters reported for wmap3 imply that structure formation at high redshift on the scale of the sources responsible for reionization was delayed relative to that implied by wmap1 .",
    "this delay can account for the new value in @xmath5 without substantially changing the efficiency with which halos form stars .",
    "recombinations are fewer when reionization is later , but the reduction is modest",
    ". even the igm clumping factor on which this recombination correction depends follows the delay in structure formation .",
    "an important additional constraint on reionization is that it end at a redshift @xmath75 , in order to explain the lack of a gp trough in the spectra of quasars at @xmath76 .",
    "because the gp trough saturates at a very small neutral fraction , the quasar data alone do not tell us when the universe became mostly ionized .",
    "indeed , it is possible for the ionized fraction to have been quite high already at high redshift @xmath77 while there remained a neutral fraction sufficiently high to satisfy the gp constraint at @xmath78 ( e.g. , choudhury & ferrara 2006 ) . while the universe may become mostly ionized well before @xmath78",
    ", it can not be later than this , however . because of the shifting in time of structure formation we have described , any model of reionization which previously satisfied the wmap1 @xmath49 constraint _ and _ became mostly ionized at @xmath79",
    "would now reionize too late to be compatible with the quasar observations .",
    "recently , haiman & bryan ( 2006 ) used this fact to deduce that the formation of massive pop  iii stars was suppressed in minihalos .",
    "while @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the most likely values obtained from the new wmap data alone , there remain significant uncertainties . when combined with other data sets such as large - scale structure ( e.g. , spergel et al .",
    "2006 ) and the lyman-@xmath7 forest ( e.g. , viel , haehnelt , & lewis 2006 ; seljak , slosar , & mcdonald 2006 ) , important differences arise .",
    "while these differences may seem small from the point of view of the statistical error of the observational data , the implications for reionization can be quite dramatic , as we have seen here .",
    "it is also important to note that these measurements of the power spectrum are on scales much larger than those relevant to the sources of reionization . as such",
    ", the theory of reionization requires us to extrapolate the power spectrum by orders of magnitude beyond where it is currently measured .",
    "this means that the study of reionization is crucial to extending the observational constraints on the origin of primordial density fluctuations ( e.g. , by inflation ) over the widest range of wavenumbers accessible to measurement .",
    "direct observations of the high redshift universe such as 21-cm tomography ( e.g. , iliev et al .",
    "2002 ; zaldarriaga , furlanetto , & hernquist 2004 ; shapiro et al . 2006 ; mellema et al . 2006 ) and large - aperture infrared telescopes such as jwst promise to diminish the uncertainties which currently prevent us from making reliable statements about the nature of the first sources of ionizing radiation .",
