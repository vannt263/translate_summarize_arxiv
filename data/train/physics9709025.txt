    "this paper provides an introduction to the use of spin polarization transport equations of fokker - planck and liouville type in electron ( positron ) and proton storage rings . as vehicles for this study",
    "i use two exactly solvable but simple configurations called machine i and machine ii .",
    "machine i is a smoothed planar ring with no vertical emittance and with spins lying in the machine plane which diffuse as the result of the stochastic nature of synchrotron radiation photon emission .",
    "it is therefore an extremely simple arrangement but it serves to introduce the concepts without the latter being obscured by unnecessary complication .",
    "machine ii is similar to machine i except that it contains a siberian snake and is therefore relevant to some existing and proposed low energy electron storage rings . by introducing the snake the equilibrium polarization is constrained to the machine plane together with the spins and it therefore becomes possible to compare the fokker - planck approach with the conventional method of calculating the spin depolarization rate and to comment on the validity of the latter .",
    "a novel aspect of this work is the introduction of a phase space dependent quantity called the polarization density .",
    "this satisfies an evolution equation of the bloch type which provides a causal azimuthal evolution of the polarization density .",
    "this linear equation is universal , like the fokker - planck equation , in the sense that it is independent of the state of the system .",
    "there is no equation which could provide a causal azimuthal evolution for the polarization vector of a given ensemble , even in the simple cases of machines i and ii .",
    "other local polarization quantities derived from the polarization density also obey evolution equations of the bloch type , but these equations depend on the orbital state of the system .    the basic orbital formalism needed is introduced in section 1 . then in section 2 the first model , machine i , is studied .",
    "this configuration was already used @xcite in a preliminary study of the rate of decoherence of spins (= ` horizontal spin diffusion ' ) lying in the machine plane of such a machine .",
    "as explained in those reports , the aim was to estimate the difficulty of using a radial rf field to flip spins which had been previously polarized into the vertical direction by the sokolov - ternov effect @xcite .",
    "the approach adopted was to consider the effect of damped stochastic synchrotron motion on the development of the distribution of spins lying in the machine plane and some numerical results were given . in this paper",
    "i will fill in some details omitted in @xcite and develop some extra analytical tools .",
    "the dynamics for machine i can be studied for various initial spin - orbit distributions . in this paper",
    "i consider two scenarios , i.e. two stochastic processes .",
    "the approach is pedagogical , step by step and exhaustive and uses elementary methods for the solution of stochastic differential equations . in scenario 1",
    "i study the phase space distribution for a starting distribution which is pointlike in both spin and orbit space . in scenario 2",
    "i begin with a pointlike spin distribution but with an orbital distribution which is already in equilibrium .",
    "the resulting phase space evolutions are referred to as process 1 and process 2 respectively . by comparing the asymptotic spin distributions",
    "i discover that they are not unique but that in both cases there is no complete decoherence .",
    "i also study the effect of switching off the synchrotron radiation .",
    "process 1 has some theoretical importance and process 2 is more closely related to physical situations .",
    "numerical results for a machine similar to the hera electron ring are presented .    in section 3",
    "i consider machine ii , where in addition to the fields of machine i the spin experiences the influence of a pointlike siberian snake @xcite .",
    "the aim here is to discover to what extent a snake can , by its tendency to cancel spin perturbations , suppress decoherence .",
    "i consider three scenarios , the stochastic processes 3,4,5 .",
    "process 3 has the same initial spin - orbit distribution as in scenario 2 for machine i and as one will see the spin exhibits transients for the first few orbital damping times .",
    "process 4 has no transients and for process 5 i set the initial local polarization parallel to the @xmath0-axis @xcite at each point in phase space . by comparing these processes",
    "one finds that in the presence of radiation the asymptotic polarization direction is not exactly parallel to the @xmath0-axis .",
    "furthermore in the presence of the snake there is complete depolarization .",
    "all of the noise processes studied in this report are processes of ornstein - uhlenbeck type and in particular they are markovian diffusion processes .",
    "one can determine their statistical properties in an explicit form .    finally , in an epilogue , i summarize further results involving the polarization density .",
    "the inclusion of a detailed account here would make this paper too long .",
    "these aspects will appear in a separate article .",
    "in this section i lay the foundations for the models to be discussed in sections 2 and 3 .",
    "the underlying mathematical model for machines i and ii @xcite comprises a three - dimensional spin - orbit system for the two longitudinal orbit variables and the angle describing the orientation of the spin in the machine plane .",
    "in contrast to _ discrete _ stochastic processes used occasionally in the literature my ` time ' parameter @xmath1 is _ continuous _ , so that i can work with differential equations .",
    "only synchrotron motion is considered and the influence of the much faster betatron oscillations is neglected as are the stern - gerlach forces ( back reaction of the spin onto the orbit ) and depolarizer fields @xcite .",
    "there are no vertical bends so that the design orbit is planar .",
    "underlying machines i and ii is the ` smooth ring ' approximation .",
    "this takes advantage of the fact that the synchrotron tune is usually very small so that the optical functions can be averaged around the ring",
    ". then the combined orbital motion is described by the following stochastic differential equation : . ]",
    "@xmath2 where @xmath1 denotes the distance around the ring ( the ` azimuth ' ) , @xmath3 the distance to the centre of the bunch , @xmath4 the fractional energy deviation , and @xmath5 simulates the noise due to the synchrotron radiation .",
    "also @xmath6 is the one turn synchrotron damping decrement and @xmath7 is the one turn averaged stochastic kick strength where in terms of the curvature @xmath8 of the design orbit in the horizontal plane @xcite : instead of @xmath9 and @xmath7 instead of @xmath10 . ]",

    "denote the charge resp .",
    "rest mass of the electron .",
    "the stochastic averages of the kicks @xmath17 are denotes dirac s delta function . ]",
    "@xmath18 thus the stochastic part of the synchrotron radiation is treated as a gaussian white noise process .",
    "this is sufficient for my purposes since the characteristic time for the emission of a photon is very small compared with other time scales of the system .",
    "finally , @xmath19 is the compaction factor , @xmath20 is the length of the ring and @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the synchrotron tune .",
    "the ring is perfectly aligned so that in the smooth approximation the closed orbit and design orbit are identical . the vertical emittance is taken to be zero .",
    "[ [ section ] ] ~    for ` machine i ' the spin vectors are restricted to the horizontal ( machine ) plane so that the spin vector @xmath23 can be described by a single phase angle @xmath24 .",
    "although spin is a quantum mechanical phenomenon , in high energy storage rings it can be treated at the semiclassical level using the thomas - bmt equation @xcite @xmath25 describing the precession of a classical spin @xmath23 in electric and magnetic fields .",
    "alternatively i can take @xmath26 to be the spin expectation value of an electron in a pure state with spin along @xmath27 .",
    "the precession vector @xmath28 is a function of the magnetic and electric fields and of the particle velocity and energy . as is usual in this context",

    "the vectors @xmath39 precess in the horizontal plane around the vertical dipole field according to ( [ eq:1.3 ] ) .",
    "the vector @xmath40 (= @xmath41 ) is vertical and therefore periodic in @xmath1 with period @xmath20 ( i.e. 1-turn periodic ) in the machine frame .",
    "is the so called ` @xmath42-axis ' of machine i. ] the orthonormal axes can be chosen as : @xmath43 in dealing only with horizontal spin i introduce the spin phase angle @xmath24 by @xmath44 by only including synchrotron oscillations and averaging ( smoothing ) the instantaneous precession rate over one turn the thomas - bmt equation is equivalent to @xmath45 thus @xmath24 only couples to and is only driven by @xmath4 .",
    "i also introduce the spin vector @xmath46 describing the spin in the @xmath47-frame , so that the thomas - bmt equation reads + as , unlike @xmath48 , is the spin vector in an arbitrary frame .",
    "thus ( [ eq:1.2 ] ) , unlike ( [ eq:1.5a ] ) , is valid in an arbitrary frame . ]",
    "@xmath49    with @xmath50 thus for machine i one has to deal with the following three - component langevin equation : @xmath51 one now sees that the noise not only acts on the orbit motion but also indirectly on the spin via its coupling to @xmath4 .",
    "it is this coupling which will lead to the spin decoherence .        with the abbreviations : @xmath52 the langevin equation ( [ eq:1.6 ] )",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath53 where @xmath54 with @xmath55 here the @xmath56 are wiener processes @xcite related to the gaussian white noise process @xmath17 formally by : @xmath57 for a practical storage ring : @xmath58 furthermore @xmath59 since @xmath60 .",
    "the inequalities ( [ eq:2.2]),([eq:2.212 ] ) are assumed throughout this paper .",

' , see appendix e. ] in particular i get @xmath66 which corresponds to about 310 turns or about 6.6 milliseconds .",
    "note that by ( [ eq:1.5b ] ) , ( [ eq:2.256 ] ) : @xmath67      because @xmath68 and @xmath69 are matrices which do not depend on @xmath70 the langevin equation ( [ eq:2.1 ] ) describes three - component processes of ornstein - uhlenbeck type @xcite .",
    "thus the stochastic integrations involved in the solution of ( [ eq:2.1 ] ) can be either defined as ito - integrations or stratonovich - integrations and lead by both methods to the fokker - planck equation ( [ eq:2.8 ] ) .",
    "the analogous situation holds for machine ii .",
    "if @xmath71 denotes the starting azimuth of a process @xmath72 then @xmath73 is always assumed to be chosen so that @xmath72 is a markovian diffusion process @xcite .. ]    the three - component differential equation ( [ eq:2.1 ] ) has essentially only two nontrivial components . writing ( [ eq:2.1 ] ) in more detail i get : @xmath74 where @xmath75 and where : @xmath76 the two - dimensionality is seen by transforming @xmath24 linearly to a new variable : @xmath77 then my langevin equation ( [ eq:2.1 ] ) is equivalent to @xmath78 so that @xmath79 is @xmath1-independent .",

    "the processes can be either described ` directly ' by handling the stochastic averages @xmath94 or ` indirectly ' by ` ensembles ' via the corresponding probabilities , e.g. the probability density @xmath83 .",
    "the latter obeys a fokker - planck equation and for the langevin equation ( [ eq:2.1 ] ) the fokker - planck equation has the form @xcite @xmath95 where @xmath96 therefore the fokker - planck equation can be written as @xmath97 where i used the abbreviations @xmath98      the ` orbital part ' @xmath99 of a probability density @xmath83 is defined by @xmath100 because @xmath83 denotes the probability density of a process @xmath101 , one observes that @xmath99 is the probability density of the corresponding orbital process @xmath102 .",

    "@xmath104 furthermore the orbital part of the probability density is normalized by @xmath105 which follows from ( [ eq:2.9 ] ) . because @xmath83 solves the fokker - planck equation ( [ eq:2.8 ] )",

    "given a function @xmath110 depending only on @xmath24 one sees that its stochastic average is determined by @xmath107 , i.e. @xmath111      with the standard boundary conditions one can introduce via fourier transformation a ` characteristic function ' , namely @xmath112 corresponding to @xmath83 , defined by @xcite : @xmath113 so that @xmath114 since @xmath83 fulfills the fokker - planck equation ( [ eq:2.8 ] ) , one finds : @xmath115 analogously , for the orbital part one defines : @xmath116 from which follows @xmath117 because @xmath99 fulfills the orbital fokker - planck equation ( [ eq:2.15 ] ) , i conclude : @xmath118      my chosen boundary conditions ( see ( [ eq:2.9 ] ) and the sentences following ) are very natural for @xmath119 .",
    "after all , the rms relative energy spread for the values ( [ eq:2.3 ] ) is about @xmath120 and the rms bunch length is about 1 cm . on the contrary i will be dealing with spreads in @xmath24 of order @xmath121 or more so that at first sight it would seem unnatural to choose the domain @xmath87 for @xmath24 . indeed ,",
    "if one writes the spin vector @xmath48 in spherical coordinates as : @xmath122 then by ( [ eq:1.4 ] ) one can identify @xmath24 as the azimuthal angle , where the polar angle @xmath123 equals @xmath124 . since the values @xmath125 resp .",
    "@xmath126 are identified it would then seem more appropriate to use a probability density @xmath127 which fulfills periodic boundary conditions in @xmath24 : @xmath128 the normalization condition ( [ eq:2.9 ] ) would then be replaced by @xmath129 however process 2 considered in this section has , for @xmath130 , a gaussian probability density .",
    "furthermore process 1 has , for @xmath130 , a probability density which is a combination of a gaussian function and a delta function .",
    "thus it is more convenient to adopt boundary conditions which allow one to work with gaussians as much as possible .",

    "moreover one then finds that @xmath139 .",
    "the expression ( [ eq:2.242 ] ) is of special interest if semiclassical considerations come into play .",

    "symmetric .",
    "because @xmath72 is a process of ornstein - uhlenbeck type it may be shown by using the standard boundary conditions that the covariance matrix satisfies the following differential equation @xcite : @xmath146 in component form ( [ eq:2.18 ] ) results in : @xmath147 for the first moment vector @xmath148 one gets the following differential equation : @xmath149 the differential equations ( [ eq:2.18]),([eq:2.19 ] ) can be easily derived from ( [ eq:2.1 ] ) .",
    "they are valid for all processes running with machine i and are particularly useful for processes whose probability densities are determined only by the covariance matrix and the first moment vector such as processes 1 and 2 .",
    "these equations also show that for every process running with machine i the covariance matrix and the first moment vector depend smoothly on @xmath1 .",
    "for the orbital part one gets : @xmath150 where : @xmath151 and where @xmath152 denotes the ` orbital covariance matrix ' .",
    "note that one has by ( [ eq:2.224 ] ) : @xmath153 because one has for @xmath154 : @xmath155 the differential equations ( [ eq:2.18]),([eq:2.19 ] ) can be alternatively derived from ( [ eq:2.8 ] ) or from ( [ eq:2.41 ] ) . ) of @xmath83 it also follows by ( [ eq:2.40 ] ) : @xmath156 ] note that the differential equations ( [ eq:2.18]),([eq:2.19 ] ) in general do not hold for boundary conditions different from the standard boundary conditions .",
    "since machine ii also gives rise to processes of ornstein - uhlenbeck type , relations analogous to equations ( [ eq:2.18 ] ) and ( [ eq:2.19 ] ) will apply .",
    "in machine i the orbital motion is not influenced by the spin motion ( see ( [ eq:2.1 ] ) ) .",
    "thus once the orbital motion of a process has been determined , finding the spin motion reduces to solving the stochastic differential equation ( [ eq:2.233b ] ) for @xmath24 .",
    "equation ( [ eq:2.233b ] ) for the process @xmath157 is equivalent to the thomas - bmt equation ( [ eq:1.5a ] ) for the process @xmath158 . the @xmath1-dependent vector @xmath159 is a stochastic process whose properties are determined by the process @xmath160 . with ( [ eq:1.5a ] )",
    "one has moulded the spin motion of a stochastic process into the stochastic motion of the spin vector ( ` brownian motion on the 2-sphere ' ) . instead of the spin variable @xmath24 this approach uses the variable @xmath48",
    "which together with the orbit variables constitutes a five - component spin - orbit vector @xmath161 whose fifth component vanishes in our case since the spin is horizontal . for the models studied in the present article",

    "the interpretation of these findings is straightforward ; although , as discussed above , the @xmath0-axis should give the local polarization direction in the absence of radiation , this is no longer exactly true in the presence of radiation .",
    "we have already seen for process 3 that when the initial polarization direction deviates typically by 200 milliradians from the asymptotic local polarization direction , polarization fluctuations of several percent occur which eventually damp away while at the same time the local polarization direction approaches its asymptotic distribution .",
    "a similar thing happens with process 5 except that the difference between the @xmath0-axis and the asymptotic local polarization direction is very small so that the polarization fluctuations are correspondingly small .",
    "it can be shown using ( [ eq:3.84 ] ) , ( [ eq : b.2 ] ) that the angle between the @xmath0-axis and the asymptotic local polarization direction at the phase space point where @xmath603 and @xmath604 is given at the snake by : @xmath696 which vanishes in the limit where @xmath697 and @xmath7 go to zero with @xmath596 and which for small @xmath697 is given approximately by : @xmath698 thus i have shown that the @xmath0-axis does not describe the direction of the local polarization in machine ii in the presence of radiation . however , the relative difference in the directions is extremely small and can , for practical purposes be ignored for machine ii .",
    "the depolarization rate obtained using slim @xcite for a real perfectly aligned flat hera lattice with a pointlike radial snake and when only spin diffusion due to synchrotron motion generated in the arcs is included , is in satisfactory agreement with @xmath699 @xcite .",
    "as one can see from ( [ eq : b.7 ] ) , the slim approximation to the @xmath0-axis is quite good near phase space points where @xmath603 and @xmath604 .",
    "however , it becomes progressively worse towards the edges of phase space .    in the absence of radiation",
    "the local polarization direction should be parallel to the @xmath0-axis and the polarization of an ensemble in orbital equilibrium set up in this state should be constant from turn to turn .",
    "this can be confirmed analytically by putting @xmath697 and @xmath7 to zero with @xmath700 , in which limit process 5 modifies to ` process 5a ' . using ( [ eq:3.103 ] ) , ( [ eq:3.107 ] ) the polarization at the snake",
    "is then given by : @xmath701 which is indeed constant from turn to turn .",
    "also the local polarization is constant from turn to turn . for the hera values ( [ eq:2.3 ] )",
    "this expression gives about @xmath702 .",
    "it also coincides with the constant polarization seen in process 4a .",
    "one can now see why the polarization of process 4a is constant from turn to turn ; if , as in process 4 , i require that the local polarization direction is already asymptotic at @xmath210 and switch off the radiation , this local polarization direction must coincide with the @xmath0-axis since it now fulfills the characteristic properties of the @xmath0-axis .",
    "then , just as in process 5a , the polarization must be constant from turn to turn and process 4a is identical with process 5a .",
    "although the synchrotron radiation parameters @xmath697 and @xmath7 are @xmath1-independent the present formalism can be used to analyze more complex rings .",
    "for example , the green function for the polarization density , in particular the radiationless green function , can be used to analyze the effect of ` lumped ' radiators such as asymmetric wigglers @xcite . if , for example , a wiggler is placed diametrically opposite the snake , then one expects on the basis of standard ` spin matching ' concepts that the spin diffusion due to the extra excitation of @xmath4 would be almost cancelled @xcite .",
    "this can be made quantitative by considering the ` @xmath703 matrix ' , the @xmath704 spin - orbit coupling matrix of the slim formalism .",
    "writing this in the form @xmath705 where the @xmath706 s are @xmath707 matrices it is simple to show @xcite that @xmath708 for the interval from @xmath709 to @xmath710 in machine ii is : @xmath711 the nonzero matrix elements of @xmath708 vanish as @xmath712 goes to zero and then in linear approximation a spin travelling from @xmath709 to @xmath710 on any synchrotron orbit is unperturbed overall .",
    "this interval is then said to be ` spin transparent ' and the depolarization due to the wiggler is cancelled . for the hera values ( [ eq:2.3 ] )",
    "@xmath708 does not exactly vanish but since @xmath22 is small @xmath708 is still small enough to ensure that the depolarization due to the wiggler should be largely suppressed .",
    "however , in realistic machines like hera , there is still excitation in the remainder of the ring .",
    "so even if the radiation power from the wiggler were dominant , the radiation in the remainder of the ring would still cause depolarization on the ` time ' scale @xmath580 .",
    "these conjectures are confirmed by numerical calculations with slim @xcite .",
    "spin transparency can be discussed using the polarization density . since in this section",
    "i am only considering the radiation from the wiggler , this condition can be investigated using the polarization density for the radiationless case .",
    "the causality properties of the azimuthal evolution for machine ii are the same as for machine i , so that in particular one has a green function for the polarization density . for the radiationless case the green function @xmath713 for the radiationless bloch equation ( [ eq:3.11 ] )",

    "however in the presence of a siberian snake ( processes 3,4 and 5 ) there is complete spin decoherence , a result which is to some extent counter intuitive given that snakes tend to stabilize the polarization .",
    "the asymptotic depolarization rates agree with slim estimates and in the presence of radiation the asymptotic local polarization direction is not exactly parallel to the @xmath0-axis .",
    "the radiationless green function for the polarization density offers another tool for studying spin matching . in processes 2a and 3a the polarization oscillates indefinitely but in processes 4a and 5a , the spin distribution begins in equilibrium and remains there .",
    "the models considered here are extremely simple but in the next section i indicate how the polarization density ( and the local polarization vector and its direction ) can be used in realistic cases .",
    "this paper is the first part of a paper prepared in 1995 but not distributed . in the second part",
    "i demonstrate that the polarization density defined on a six - dimensional orbital phase space for full three - dimensional spin motion also obeys a universal evolution equation of bloch type with the same linear structure as equations ( [ eq:2.64 ] ) , ( [ eq:3.10 ] ) , namely @xmath730 where @xmath731 denotes the orbital fokker - planck operator and where the vector @xmath732 is determined by the thomas - bmt equation . in the more general formulation",
    "i use periodic boundary conditions for the spin phase .",
    "the polarization density is appropriate for use with arbitrarily complicated rings .",
    "the local polarization vector and its direction are also useful tools ( especially at orbital equilibrium ) and by using these and their bloch equations i obtain an expression for the depolarization rate in terms of the azimuthal and phase space average of @xmath733 which generalizes the average of @xmath734 in equation 6.2 in @xcite . denotes the design orbit curvature , e.g. @xmath735 ( see section 1 ) .",
    "] by calculating the depolarization rate for machine ii in terms of @xmath736 i reproduce the @xmath640 of ( [ eq:3.59 ] ) . in fact the derivation of the bloch equation for the general polarization density constitutes a classical construction for the pure depolarization part of equation 2 in @xcite which was obtained by semiclassical methods .",
    "using the polarization density one can estimate the angle between the @xmath0-axis and the true local polarization direction in practical rings .",
    "the sokolov - ternov process can be included by adding in parts of the baier - katkov - strakovenko expression @xcite in an obvious way .",
    "one then has many of the terms in equation 2 in @xcite .",
    "the remaining terms can only be obtained by a full semiclassical treatment of the radiation process and this work is in progress and will be published at a later date together with the classical work on the general polarization density .",
    "the use of the polarization density obviates the need to begin the calculation of the depolarization rate by first diagonalizing the the combined spin - orbit hamiltonian as in @xcite .",
    "in this appendix i show that the thomas - bmt equation ( [ eq:3.4 ] ) for machine ii , defined in the rotating frame @xmath737 of section 3.1 , follows from ( [ eq:3.1 ] ) .",
    "first of all i have to show that the vectors @xmath738 solve the closed orbit thomas - bmt equation : @xmath739 where by section 3.1 : @xmath740 i call the region outside the snake ` the arcs ' and there ( [ eq : a.1 ] ) reduces to a precession around @xmath35 , so that on the closed orbit and in the machine frame the spin transfer matrix in the arcs reads as : @xmath741 i.e. in the arcs : @xmath742 to get the spin transfer matrix for the snake i first write down ( [ eq : a.1 ] ) for the snake which results in @xmath743 where in the machine frame @xmath744 reads as : @xmath745 because the matrix @xmath744 is @xmath1-independent in the machine frame one easily finds that in this frame the spin transfer matrix for the snake is given on the closed orbit by : @xmath746 the @xmath42-axis of machine ii is given by : @xmath747 it obviously solves ( [ eq : a.1 ] ) in the arcs and is 1-turn periodic in the machine frame . to check if it solves ( [ eq : a.1 ] ) also at the snake i note that @xmath748 from which follows by ( [ eq : a.3 ] ) : @xmath749 so that in fact @xmath471 solves ( [ eq : a.1 ] ) at the snake . thus @xmath471 is a unit - vector solution of ( [ eq : a.1 ] ) , which is 1-turn periodic in the machine frame , i.e. @xmath750 is the @xmath518-axis of machine ii .",
    "now i consider @xmath751 which is defined by : @xmath752 one easily finds that @xmath753 solves ( [ eq : a.1 ] ) in the arcs . to check if it solves ( [ eq : a.1 ] )",
    "also at the snake i calculate by ( [ eq : a.3 ] ) : @xmath754 so that in fact @xmath753 solves ( [ eq : a.1 ] ) at the snake .",
    "thus i have shown that the dreibein @xmath755 solves ( [ eq : a.1 ] ) , where @xmath756      now one can derive ( [ eq:3.4 ] ) from ( [ eq:3.1 ] ) .",
    "first of all i define @xmath757 so that ( [ eq:3.1 ] ) is equivalent to the following equation for @xmath758 : @xmath759 with @xmath760 where @xcite . @xmath761",
    "therefore @xmath762 hence i have shown that ( [ eq:3.4 ] ) follows from ( [ eq:3.1 ] ) .",
    "in this appendix i calculate the @xmath647-axis of machine ii .- axis for machine i is given by @xmath763 . ]",
    "as mentioned in section 3.7.1 the @xmath0-axis is denoted by @xmath648 and it obeys the following radiationless bloch equation : @xmath764 in fact , ( [ eq : b.1 ] ) holds because in the @xmath480-frame the @xmath0-axis obeys the radiationless bloch equation ( [ eq:3.11 ] ) .",
    "i begin by assuming that the @xmath647-axis is horizontal , so that i make the ansatz : @xmath765 where @xmath766 needs to be determined",
    ". then with the ansatz that @xmath767 is linear in @xmath119 one finally gets @xmath768 where @xmath769 is defined in section 3.1 and where : @xmath770      in this section i show that @xmath648 , as defined by ( [ eq : b.2]),([eq : b.4]),([eq : b.5 ] ) fulfills all properties of an @xmath0-axis .    inserting ( [ eq : b.2 ] ) into ( [ eq : b.1 ] ) gives the following equation in the arcs : @xmath771 also by ( [ eq : b.2 ] ) , ( [ eq : b.4 ] ) one finds that @xmath648 depends smoothly on the variables @xmath119 so that ( [ eq : b.1 ] ) reads at the snake as : @xmath772 note that for @xmath773 @xmath767 reduces by ( [ eq : b.4]),([eq : b.5 ] ) to : @xmath774 it is easily checked that this expression solves ( [ eq : b.3 ] ) .",
    "one also observes by ( [ eq : b.4]),([eq : b.5 ] ) that : @xmath775 from this follows by ( [ eq : a.3]),([eq : b.2 ] ) : @xmath776 so that @xmath648 obeys ( [ eq : b.8 ] ) at the snake .",
    "one also sees that @xmath766 , given by ( [ eq : b.4 ] ) , is 1-turn periodic in @xmath1 .",
    "thus i have shown that @xmath777 , given by ( [ eq : b.2 ] ) , ( [ eq : b.4 ] ) , is a unit - vector solution of the radiationless bloch equation ( [ eq : b.1 ] ) , 1-turn periodic in @xmath1 in the machine frame .",
    "it is thus the vector field @xmath0 of @xcite .",
    "note that for @xmath778 one gets : @xmath779 one also observes that with this ansatz a singularity in @xmath780 occurs if the fractional part of the orbital tune @xmath781 equals @xmath478 , i.e. if one is at a spin - orbit resonance .      denoting the @xmath647-axis in the @xmath480-frame by @xmath658 one observes by ( [ eq:3.3 ] ) , ( [ eq:3.244 ] ) , ( [ eq : b.2 ] ) , ( [ eq : b.4 ] ) : @xmath782 the corresponding formula obtained from the slim formalism , which linearizes spin motion and is therefore only applicable for small angles between the @xmath0-axis and the @xmath42-axis , is @xcite : @xmath783 from the above it is clear that @xmath658 obeys the radiationless bloch equation ( [ eq:3.11 ] ) .",
    "in this appendix i briefly reconsider machine i by extending it to ` machine iii ' which is obtained by including the nonhorizontal component of the spin vector , i.e. by considering the full three - dimensional spin motion . for horizontal spin the dynamics of machine iii",
    "is the same as for machine i.    as for machine i i denote the spin vector in the @xmath47-frame by @xmath48 . to cover the full three - dimensional spin motion",
    "one can employ , as mentioned in section 2.3.6 , spherical coordinates , so that : @xmath784 where @xmath785 denote the azimuthal and polar angles . the horizontal spin vector ( [ eq:1.4 ] ) can be obtained from ( [ eq : c.1 ] ) by setting @xmath786 .",
    "thus for @xmath786 machine iii effectively reduces to machine i.    in dealing with 4 variables , the processes to be studied for machine iii are denoted by @xmath787 , where : @xmath788 i.e. compared with @xmath101 they have an additional component .",
    "the langevin equation for machine iii is then defined by : @xmath789 where @xmath790 with @xmath791 here the @xmath792 are wiener processes .",
    "one sees by the behaviour of the @xmath123-variable in the langevin equation ( [ eq : c.4 ] ) that machine iii indeed describes the same dynamics as machine i. therefore the fokker - planck equation corresponding to the langevin equation ( [ eq : c.4 ] ) is identical with the fokker - planck equation ( [ eq:2.8 ] ) for machine i.    for machine iii i adopt standard boundary conditions in all four variables @xmath793 so that : @xmath794 for @xmath795 , where @xmath796 denotes the probability density .",
    "thus the probability density is normalized by : @xmath797 the polarization vector is defined by : @xmath798 the polarization density is defined by : @xmath799 using the fokker - planck equation ( [ eq:2.8 ] ) one observes by ( [ eq : c.8 ] ) that the polarization density fulfills the same bloch equation ( [ eq:2.64 ] ) as for machine i.    for a process with only horizontal spin the probability density has the form : @xmath800 where @xmath470 denotes an integer and where @xmath83 denotes the probability density which arises if the process would be described in the framework of machine i. note that @xmath796 , as given by ( [ eq : c.9 ] ) , fulfills the fokker - planck equation ( [ eq:2.8 ] ) .",
    "in section 2.9 i observed that the equilibrium behaviour of machine i in the presence of radiation resembles a hamiltonian flow . in this appendix",
    "i now briefly reconsider machine i by switching off the radiation effects to obtain a real hamiltonian flow .",
    "i call this model ` machine iv ' .",
    "the aim is to investigate the existence of an equilibrium spin distribution and to do that i adopt the usual approach of describing the system in terms of action - angle variables .",
    "since i use a canonical formalism i need an even number of variables .",
    "hence i supplement @xmath86 by a fourth variable @xmath801 , canonically conjugate to @xmath24 , which is defined by : @xmath802 where @xmath123 denotes the polar angle in the spherical coordinate expression ( [ eq:2.240 ] ) of the spin vector @xmath48 .",
    "is used instead of @xmath801 . ]",
    "thus for machine iv the spin vector in the @xmath47-frame is parametrized as : @xmath803 hence , as for machine iii , i consider the full three - dimensional spin motion , i.e. the nonhorizontal component of the spin vector is included .",
    "one sees that the additional variable describes the projection of the spin onto the vertical direction so that for processes running with machine i one has : @xmath804 . but",
    "owing to the field geometry in machine i one could have carried through the analysis with nonzero @xmath801 if i had only been interested in the @xmath24 distribution .",
    "the poisson brackets are defined by @xcite:),([eq : d.2 ] ) i use units in appendix d where @xmath805 has the dimension of length @xcite . ] @xmath806 and the hamiltonian reads as : @xmath807 where @xmath248 is defined in section 2.5 and : @xmath808 due to the absence of radiation the langevin equation for machine iv reduces to the following canonical equations of motion : @xmath809 one sees that @xmath810 contributes a ( very small ) stern - gerlach term @xcite appearing in the first identity of ( [ eq : d.23 ] ) which was neglected for machine i because this stern - gerlach effect vanishes at @xmath804 .",
    "thus machine iii , unlike machine iv , is lacking the stern - gerlach force and machine iv , unlike machine iii , is lacking radiation effects .",
    "both machines involve the full three - dimensional spin motion but they parametrize it in different ways .",
    "coming to the probability density , i now adopt boundary conditions for the variables @xmath811 which are natural for their role as spherical coordinates .",
    "in particular i adopt for @xmath24 the periodic boundary conditions mentioned in section 2.3.6 .",
    "the probability density in the present case also depends on @xmath801 and i denote it by @xmath812 . the normalization condition ( [ eq:2.206 ] ) for @xmath127",
    "translates by using ( [ eq : d.22 ] ) into : @xmath813 for horizontal spin @xmath812 has the form : @xmath814 due to the absence of radiation the fokker - planck equation for machine iv is the liouville equation for the phase space evolution associated with the hamiltonian ( [ eq : d.3 ] ) : @xmath815 the total derivative is zero for a hamiltonian flow @xcite .      to investigate the matter of equilibrium with the help of the evolution equation ( [ eq : d.8 ] ) i transform to action - angle variables",
    "to come to these i first replace @xmath119 by the orbital variables @xmath816 defined in section 2.5 .",
    "thus i treat my system using the variables @xmath817 with the poisson brackets : @xmath818 the hamiltonian ( [ eq : d.3 ] ) transforms into @xmath819 this hamiltonian is not yet in action - angle form since it still contains the phase @xmath244 .",
    "the probability density @xmath820 for the variables @xmath817 reads as : @xmath821 note that @xmath820 is periodic in @xmath822 with period @xmath121 . for the final step in obtaining the action - angle variables",
    "i use the spin - orbit action - angle formalism of @xcite .",
    "this allows one to perform the following canonical transformation + @xmath823 : @xmath824 whereby the terms containing @xmath801 in ( [ eq : d.13a ] ) , ( [ eq : d.13b ] ) are due to stern - gerlach effects and are very small so that in effect the new orbital variables are numerically very close to the original orbital variables .",
    "the new variables have the following poisson brackets : in a specific way which is made use of in ( [ eq : d.14 ] ) . ]",
    "@xmath825 the hamiltonian @xmath826 transforms into : @xmath827 and since it now only contains an action i finally have the desired form .",
    "note that this hamiltonian does not contain the spin action @xmath828 .",
    "note also that @xmath829 is identical to @xmath223 in section 2.2 .",
    "thus one sees that this canonical transformation which has removed the spin dependence from the hamiltonian is equivalent to the reduction from a three - dimensional problem to a two - dimensional problem observed by ( [ eq:2.6b ] ) .",
    "this reduction reflects the nonuniqueness of the equilibrium state already observed in section 2 in the presence of radiation effects . denoting the probability density in these variables by @xmath830 one",
    "gets : @xmath831 note that @xmath830 is periodic in @xmath832 with period @xmath121 .",
    "the corresponding liouville equation reads as : @xmath833      having obtained action - angle variables one now can discuss equilibrium .",
    "i define ` equilibrium ' to mean that @xmath834 is zero . then by ( [ eq : d.18 ] ) the poisson bracket @xmath835 vanishes .",
    "since @xmath836 is independent of @xmath837 the probability density @xmath830 must be independent of @xmath837 .",
    "however , since ( [ eq : d.15 ] ) does not contain @xmath828 the probability density @xmath830 can still depend on @xmath829 .",
    "the interpretation of this is that since the @xmath829 for each particle is constant ( see ( [ eq:2.6b ] ) ) , the @xmath829 distribution does not change as @xmath1 increases and is therefore in equilibrium .",
    "so although i have a complete transformation to action - angle variables the special form for the hamiltonian ( [ eq : d.15 ] ) means that by insisting on equilibrium one can not say very much about the @xmath829 distribution except that @xmath830 has the form @xmath838 so that @xmath830 neither depends on @xmath837 nor on @xmath1 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath830 on @xmath829 reflects the nonuniqueness of the equilibrium state already observed in section 2 in the presence of radiation effects .",
    "if on the contrary the hamiltonian had contained @xmath828 the @xmath829 distribution would have had to be uniform . in the case of horizontal spin one",
    "has @xmath804 so that by ( [ eq : d.13d ] ) one has : @xmath839 .",
    "then ( [ eq : d.19 ] ) simplifies to : @xmath840 where @xmath841 neither depends on @xmath842 nor on @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath1-dependence of the first moment of the variables @xmath119 allows one to define a damping time for every process .",
    "it turns out that this ` orbital damping time ' is independent of the process .",
    "it is the same for machines i and ii since they have the same orbital equations of motion .",
    "also it is shown how the orbital damping time is involved in the orbital correlation matrix ( defined below ) .",
    "for a given process @xmath843 the stochastic averages of the orbital variables are given via ( [ eq:2.225 ] ) , ( [ eq:2.231 ] ) by : @xmath844 one observes by ( [ eq:2.232 ] ) , ( [ eq : e.10 ] ) that @xmath845 contains the exponentially decreasing factor @xmath846 and that the remaining factors are periodic in @xmath1 with period @xmath847 .",
    "i therefore define the orbital damping time , denoted as @xmath63 , by : @xmath848 one sees that @xmath63 is independent of the process .",
    "the ` orbital correlation matrix ' @xmath849 is defined by @xcite : @xmath850 where @xmath851 using the orbital joint probability density @xmath282 given by ( [ eq:2.236 ] ) one finds for @xmath262 : @xmath852 because of ( [ eq:2.225 ] ) , ( [ eq:2.220 ] ) , ( [ eq:2.236 ] ) , ( [ eq : e.2 ] ) , ( [ eq : e.9 ] ) one has for @xmath262 : @xmath853 also by ( [ eq:2.17 ] ) , ( [ eq : e.2 ] ) one has : @xmath854 where @xmath152 denotes the orbital covariance matrix . from ( [ eq : e.4 ] ) , ( [ eq : e.3 ] ) it follows for @xmath262 that : @xmath855 and from ( [ eq:2.231]),([eq : e.5 ] ) i have for @xmath262 : @xmath856 then by ( [ eq:2.232]),([eq : e.6 ] ) one finds for @xmath262 that the matrix elements of the orbital correlation matrix contain the exponentially decreasing factor @xmath846 .",
    "the remaining factors are periodic in @xmath1 with period @xmath847 .",
    "therefore @xmath63 is not only the orbital damping time , but also plays the role of an ` orbital correlation time ' .",

    "<S> i present some simple exactly solvable models of spin diffusion caused by synchrotron radiation noise in storage rings . </S>",
    "<S> i am able to use standard stochastic differential equation and fokker - planck methods and i thereby introduce , and exploit , the _ polarization density_. this quantity obeys a linear evolution equation of the bloch type , which is , like the fokker - planck equation , universal in the sense that it is independent of the state of the system . </S>",
    "<S> i also briefly consider bloch equations for other local polarization quantities derived from the polarization density . </S>",
    "<S> one of the models chosen is of relevance for some existing and proposed low energy electron ( positron ) storage rings which need polarization . </S>",
    "<S> i present numerical results for a ring with parameters typical of hera and show that , where applicable , the results of my approach are in satisfactory agreement with calculations using slim . </S>",
    "<S> these calculations provide a numerical check of a basic tenet of the conventional method of calculating depolarization using the @xmath0-axis . </S>",
    "<S> i also investigate the equilibrium behaviour of the spin ensemble when there is no synchrotron radiation . </S>",
    "<S> finally , i summarize other results which i have obtained using the polarization density and which will be published separately . </S>"
