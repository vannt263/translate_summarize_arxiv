    "oscillating random waves are present in a myriad of situations in nature , displaying a large variety of scales and exhibiting turbulent - like behavior , the so - called wave turbulence  @xcite .",
    "of particular interest are the oscillations over the surface of the sea , rossby waves in atmospherical science , nonlinear optics , the plasma oscillations and the vibration of elastic bodies such as piano strings , timbals , or more complex singing bowls , bells or gongs .",
    "because of the intrinsic nonlinearity of the basic underlying physics of these problems , and because of the randomness of the phase of the oscillations , only a statistical description seems reasonable .",
    "the weak turbulence theory provides such a statistical description for the asymptotic long time behavior of the spectral wave amplitude , in the case where nonlinearities are small . in particular",
    ", it describes the energy transfer among the different modes in agreement with the conservation of the total energy of the waves .",
    "more precisely , this wave turbulence theory provides kinetic equations for the long - time evolution of the spectral amplitude for dispersive wave systems @xcite . in the present context of small nonlinearities , we will use interchangeably wave turbulence theory and weak turbulence theory and refer to it as wtt .",
    "remarkably , such kinetic equations exhibit stationary solutions corresponding to equipartition or constant flux cascades of the energy , namely the rayleigh - jeans solution and the kolmogorov - zakharov ( kz ) spectrum respectively .",
    "the search of the kz spectra has motivated exhaustive studies these last fifty years  @xcite , regaining recent interest , because of the parallel development of new theoretical and experimental findings . among them , we mention the cases of surface capillary waves @xcite , surface gravity waves @xcite and elastic waves of thin plates @xcite for instance . while such dynamics corresponds usually to a direct cascade of energy towards the small scales , the formation of large scale structure can sometimes be observed .",
    "this is the case in particular for bose - eintein condensation  @xcite or in two dimensional hydrodynamic turbulence @xcite , where the self organization process is a consequence of an inverse cascade .",
    "this inverse cascade transfers some quantity ( particles , enstrophy , wave action ) from the small scales toward the large scales leading to the formation of coherent structures .",
    "the formation of an inverse cascade in different systems has always been related to the existence of a conserved quantity at least at the weakly non linear level .",
    "for instance , when using the gross - pitaevskii or nonlinear schrdinger equation to model the bose - einstein condensates , wtt predicts the existence of an inverse cascade of mass ( a conserved quantity ) .",
    "similarly , in the case of surface gravity waves , an inverse cascade of the conserved wave action is deduced and numerically observed @xcite .",
    "finally , we want to emphasize that besides the description of the stationary solutions of the dynamics , the kinetic equations that are deduced by the wtt give a very good framework to investigate non stationary situations involved in wave systems such as transitory or decaying regimes that often lead to self - similar dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to show , using the elastic vibrating plate , that the formation of an inverse cascade does not generally require a conserved quantity , opening up the possibility of self organization for a larger class of systems . in particular",
    ", nothing prevents the existence of a time dependent inverse cascade that would transfer wave action from short scale to large scale .",

    "the spectral dynamic described by the kinetic equation ( [ kineticeqn ] ) corresponds to four - waves resonances which enforce the energy and momentum conservations in each interaction .",

    "these solutions are named the kolmogorov - zakharov ( kz ) spectra , because zakharov s findings are in close relation with the kolmogorov scaling arguments used in fluid turbulence .",

    "such arguments guarantee only that the scaling of the solution is consistent with the collisional operator . however , since the denominator vanish for those exponents , one needs in addition that the collisional operator vanishes in order to obtain stationary solutions of the kinetic equation .",

    "it indicates that both the rayleigh - jeans and the kz solutions exist for @xmath72 . in practice ,",
    "the resulting flux is zero , thus a logarithmic correction should be included on the final spectrum @xcite .",
    "therefore , the above considerations imply that only one cascade is guaranteed , namely a direct cascade of energy toward the small scales , which remarkably is not a simple power law .",

    ". however , experimental observations  @xcite present a slightly different behavior for the direct energy cascade , which is understood as follows . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is shown that the dominant low frequency dissipation rate of the damping suppresses the existence of a window of transparency in the wave number range probed by the experiment .",
    "it turns out , that the stationary spectrum for a vibrating plate comes from the balance between the kinetic collision integral , the forcing and damping , displaying no simple kz scaling spectrum , and exhibiting a strong dependence on the damping mechanisms @xcite .",
    "we conclude this section with the following remark .",
    "if one neglects the @xmath50 resonances in the kinetic equation , that is if one imposes @xmath77\\approx 0 $ ] , then an inverse cascade of wave action with constant flux can exist in addition to the direct cascade of energy .",

    "this inverse cascade transfers wave action between modes , a self - organization process which may lead to the formation of coherent structures and eventually to the breakdown of the wtt  @xcite .",
