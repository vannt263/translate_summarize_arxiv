    "an uhe photon produces a `` normal '' air shower , easily detectable with a giant shower observatory .",
    "still , such photon showers have characteristics that make them well distinguishable from showers initiated by primary hadrons .",
    "the calculation of these photon shower characteristics can be done with high confidence because qed effects dominate , such that solid conclusions can be drawn from the data .",
    "a substantial flux of uhe photons is predicted in top - down models  @xcite . even in conventional cosmic - ray scenarios ,",
    "uhe photons may be produced at detectable level  @xcite ; as their expected flux at earth depends on uncertain parameters such as source density , injection spectrum or extragalactic radio background , findings on uhe photons will provide valuable astrophysics information .    in the following , the current status of the search for uhe photons at the pierre auger observatory is briefly summarized .",

    "can also create a preshower ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) : as indicated by the splitting of the photon line , the average @xmath2 values then do not only depend on primary energy but also arrival direction . for nuclear primaries ,",
    "calculations for different hadronic interaction models are displayed .",
    "one sees that at 10  eev , photons penetrate deeper into the atmosphere than hadron primaries by ( on average ) @xmath0200  g  @xmath5 or more .",

    "@xcite . ) ]    showers initiated by uhe photons develop differently from showers induced by nuclear primaries .",
    "particularly , observables related to the development stage or `` age '' of a shower ( such as the depth of shower maximum @xmath7 and to the content of shower muons provide good sensitivity to identify primary photons .",
    "photon showers are expected to develop deeper in the atmosphere ( larger @xmath2 ) , see fig .",
    "this is connected to the smaller multiplicity in electromagnetic interactions compared to hadronic ones , such that a larger number of interactions is required to degrade the energy to the critical energy where the cascading process stops .",
    "additionally , the lpm effect  @xcite results in a suppression of the pair production and bremsstrahlung cross - sections .",
    "photon showers also contain fewer secondary muons , since photoproduction and direct muon pair production are expected to play only a sub - dominant role .",
    "using high - quality hybrid events ( air showers registered by both the fluorescence telescopes and the ground array which fullfil certain strict requirements to be accepted for the analysis ) , it is possible to compare directly the observed @xmath2 values of uhe events with expectations for photon primaries of same energy and arrival direction .",
    "an example of a measured air shower and the comparison of its @xmath2 value to results from photon simulations is shown in fig .",
    "one can see that the observed @xmath2 is well below the values assuming primary photons .",
    "it is not likely that this air shower was initiated by an uhe photon .    inspecting 29 such high - quality air showers with energies above 10  eev , it turned out that in all cases the photon predictions exceed by far the observed @xmath2 values . from this , an upper limit of 16% ( 95% c.l . ) on the cosmic - ray photon fraction",
    "could be obtained as published in 2007  @xcite . despite the very small number of events ,",
    "this limit was the best one at that time above 10  eev ( to be superseded by the limit using auger ground array data , see below ) .",
    "moreover , the auger hybrid data set was the first ( and so far only ) one where the fluorescence technique with its direct observation of @xmath2 was applied to search for uhe photons .     measured in the shower shown in the top plot ( point with error bar ) compared to the @xmath8 distribution expected for photon showers ( solid line ) .",

    "@xcite . ) ]    to exploit the larger number of uhe events recorded by the ground array only ( i.e.  without requiring additional fluorescence telescope data ) , two observables of the array detectors were chosen in an analysis published in 2008  @xcite which have significantly different behavior for nuclear primaries when compared to photons : the risetime of the recorded shower signal and the radius of curvature of the shower front ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) . as an energy estimator ,",
    "the total signal deposit @xmath11 derived for a ground detector at 1000  m core distance is used by comparing the measured value to photon shower simulations .    in fig .",

    "an _ a priori _ cut had been defined such that data points lying above the mean of the photon distribution are considered as photon candidates .",
    "accounting for inefficiencies , upper limits on the presence of photons in the primary cosmic - ray beam were placed ; in particular a limit of 2% ( at 95% c.l . ) above 10  eev was derived ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , lower plot ) .    also , in this analysis the first direct limit to the _ flux _ of uhe photons ( instead of the _ fraction _ ) was obtained ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , upper plot ) . in case of ground arrays ,",
    "the flux ( or a limit on the flux ) is the more robust experimental quantity ( see refs .",
    "as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , particularly from the comparison of experimental uhe photon _ flux _ limits and model predictions ,",
    "contemporary top - down models are severely constrained now : the non - observation of uhe photons by the auger observatory is difficult to explain in exotic physics scenarios ( see e.g.  also refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the photon limits also reduce systematic uncertainties in the derivation of the total cosmic - ray flux spectrum  @xcite , since the energies of photon showers could be misreconstructed . as can also be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , there are no indications of an increasing photon component towards highest energies at the present sensitivity level .",
    "the photon bounds have also proven useful for fundamental physics . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the fraction of _ gzk photons _ expected at earth was computed assuming that lorentz invariance violation suppresses pair production by uhe photons .",
    "values were found that exceed the auger photon limits by about a factor 10 .",
    "corresponding constraints on lorentz violation parameters improve previous constraints by several orders of magnitude due to the extreme energy in case of uhe photons .",
    "data taken during the first phase of construction of the southern auger observatory allowed the derivation of uhe photons limits that approach ( in terms of fraction ) the @xmath12 level at energies above 10 eev .",
    "both detector components ( telescopes and array ) offer excellent discrimination power between photon and hadron primaries such that the sensitivity level will continue to improve over the next years while the data accumulate .",
    "the upper range of predictions for gzk photons ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) as well as the yet unexplored energy range below 10  eev can be tested soon .    with a main goal of full sky coverage ,",
    "the auger observatory is to be completed by a northern site .",
    "current plans aim at a significantly ( factor @xmath07 ) larger array to proceed with cosmic - ray astronomy .",
    "with such an enlarged northern site , photon fractions at or below the @xmath13 level are in reach within few years of operation .    as for any exploratory search ,",
    "the timescale for the final discovery of uhe photons is uncertain .",
    "however , even the very first results from the photon search at the auger observatory proved very helpful for cosmic - ray physics ( e.g.  discrimination between different cosmic - ray source scenarios ) and for fundamental physics ( test of lorentz invariance ) .",
    "it seems reasonable to believe that this ability of the uhe photon search to provide substantial physics results will persist .",
    "the unprecedented and presently _ unique _ sensitivity of the auger observatory to uhe photons , particularly when completed by the northern site , allows for the first time a realistic search for uhe photons also from conventional cosmic - ray scenarios .    a final discovery of uhe photons would open a new @xmath6 and the most extreme @xmath6 `` window '' of photon astronomy .",
    "experience shows that this is usually accompanied with radically new , and often unexpected , insights about the bizarre inhabitants of the universe and their ( inter-)actions  @xcite ( for a surely incomplete list of possible impacts of a discovery of uhe photons on various research fields , see ref .",
