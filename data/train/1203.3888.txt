    "in quantum chemistry , the electronic structure of molecules is described by either _",
    "ab initio _ wave - function methods or density - functional theory ( dft ) . for large molecular systems such as transition metal complexes , however ,",
    "wave - function based methods are rarely employed due to the corresponding high computational cost ( for counterexamples , see refs .",
    "hence , the application of dft became instrumental in theoretical studies of mechanisms in metal - mediated catalysis @xcite .",
    "yet , the treatment of open - shell systems @xcite and ( near-)degenerate states remains a challenge for dft @xcite .",
    "failures of approximate exchange  correlation density functionals in predicting properties of open - shell systems have been traced to the delocalization error and static correlation error @xcite which are rooted in an inappropriate behavior of the energy with respect to fractional charges and fractional spins @xcite .",
    "in addition to the difficult prediction of ground states from states of different spin @xcite , spin density distributions considerably depend on the approximate exchange ",
    "correlation density functional if transition metal complexes containing noninnocent ligands are considered @xcite .",
    "qualitatively correct spin density distributions are difficult to obtain within the standard kohn ",
    "sham formalism that has not been formulated to also produce accurate spin densities @xcite .    however , accurate spin densities are desirable for various reasons .",
    "( 1 ) in electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy ( epr ) @xcite , the spin density is the central quantity on which epr parameters explicitly depend @xcite . obviously , reliable spin density distributions are important for an accurate calculation of epr properties , but this remains a difficult task to achieve for theoretical chemistry @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) the question which approximate exchange  correlation density functional yields sufficiently accurate spin densities remains inconclusive @xcite .",
    "if accurate reference spin density distributions were available , a more detailed analysis of the spin density distribution in terms of spin density difference plots could be used as a qualitative _ and _ quantitative benchmark for the validation of approximate exchange ",
    "correlation density functionals .",
    "( 3 ) according to the hohenberg ",
    "kohn theorem @xcite , the spin density is not needed to calculate the electronic energy or any other expectation value . however , in open - shell systems it is often introduced as an additional variable which leads to a spin - dft formalism @xcite first introduced by von barth and hedin @xcite . in spin - dft , the spin density becomes a fundamental quantity and reliable reference spin densities could be used to construct proper approximations to the exact exchange ",
    "correlation density functional .    for accurate spin densities in cases",
    "for which a dft description fails , _ ab initio _ electron correlation methods need to be applied .",
    "presented complete - active - space self - consistent - field ( casscf ) studies for large transition metal complexes which provided deeper insights into the quality of dft spin density distributions @xcite .",
    "the large molecular size of these systems requires large active orbital spaces , but the standard casscf approach restricts their dimension which represents the most crucial approximation in such calculations @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to understand whether the spin density is converged with respect to the dimension of the active orbital spaces used so far .",
    "this is a task that is difficult to study within a standard cas - type approach .    in general , up to about 18 electrons correlated in 18 spatial orbitals",
    "are computationally feasible for standard casscf .",
    "these limitations may restrict the accurate description of electronic structures which could be approved only by enlarging the dimension of the active orbital space .",
    "reliable reference spin density distributions for complicated open - shell structures as found , for instance , in iron complexes with non - innocent ligands require capabilities beyond those of standard correlation methods .",
    "a different approach for the calculation of correlated _ ab initio _ spin densities for large molecules was recently presented by kossmann and neese @xcite who discussed the performance of orbital - optimized m@xmath5ller  plesset perturbation theory in calculating hyperfine coupling constants for atoms and small molecules . in this approach ,",
    "isotropic hyperfine constants of coupled - cluster singles - doubles quality could be obtained which could be further improved by applying spin - component scaling .    here",
    ", we pursue a different route for the calculation of _ ab initio _ spin densities by applying the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) algorithm . with the dmrg algorithm , introduced by white @xcite in 1992 ,",
    "much larger active orbital spaces can be considered beyond the limit of , say , 18 electrons correlated in 18 molecular orbitals .",
    "it was shown that dmrg is capable of providing accurate wave functions and energies even for complicated electronic structures ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews ) .",
    "moreover , we first showed that the dmrg algorithm yields reliable relative electronic energies between different spin states or isomers of transition metal complexes and clusters for which dmrg was not meant to work and which are a very challenging task for any other multi - reference quantum chemical method @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for latest results and further references ) .",
    "we shall demonstrate in this work that also accurate dmrg spin density distributions can be determined for very large active orbital spaces .",
    "recently , we presented a convergence analysis of the spin density distribution for a small iron nitrosyl model complex [ fe(no)]@xmath6 in a field of point charges , which demonstrated that medium - sized active orbital spaces are sufficient for _ quantitatively _ correct spin densities @xcite .",
    "however , a quantitative analysis that can explore truly large active spaces is still lacking for this complex , which shall therefore be the target system in this work .",
    "in such cases , dmrg spin densities can be considered as reliable references which can serve as benchmark results for approximate exchange ",
    "correlation density functionals .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section [ sec : theory ] , we discuss the spin density matrix and its spatially resolved counterpart , the spin density distribution , employing the formalism of second quantization .",
    "then , we continue with the introduction of dmrg spin densities . in section [ sec : casci ] ,",
    "we present our approach of approximating the dmrg spin density distribution by one from a complete - active - space configuration - interaction(casci)-type wave function which allows us to compare dmrg spin densities from calculations with different dmrg parameter sets . in order to validate our approach",
    ", we study the spin densities of a medium - sized active orbital space in section [ sec : test ] .",
    "this is then extended by considering up to 29 active orbitals in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "finally , a summary and concluding remarks are given in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "since dmrg is based on the second quantized formalism , we briefly discuss how the spin density in spatial coordinates can be written in second quantization . in first quantization",
    ", the operator for the spin density reads @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the @xmath9 component of the one - electron spin operator , @xmath10 is the spatial coordinate of electron @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the total number of electrons in the system . applying an orbital basis ,",
    "the corresponding operator expression in second quantization is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 run over the total orbital basis \\{@xmath15 } with @xmath16 representing the spatial part of a spin orbital .",
    "the operators @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the creation and annihilation operators , respectively , for an electron of spin @xmath19 in orbital @xmath11 . in eq.([eq_sd_operator ] ) , the spin density operator @xmath20 is defined in terms of the spin tensor excitation operators @xmath21 in the orbital basis ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "the spatially resolved spin density @xmath22 is calculated as the expectation value of @xmath23 , @xmath24 where @xmath25 represents some normalized reference state @xmath26 @xmath27 is an occupation number vector with elements @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 represents the set of all occupation number vectors constructed from @xmath30 one - particle states . the expectation value on the right hand side of eq.([eq : sd_def ] )",
    "is a spin density matrix element @xmath31 , @xmath32      if the reference state @xmath33 is a dmrg wave function in eq.([eq : sd_matrix_def ] ) , the corresponding dmrg spin density matrix elements @xmath34)}_{pq}$ ] are obtained .",
    "the matrix representations of the creation and annihilation operators are available in every step of the dmrg algorithm and each spin density matrix element can thus be easily determined .    the operator @xmath35 in its matrix representation is calculated as a tensor product for which we have to distinguish two different cases .",
    "the molecular orbitals @xmath36 and @xmath37 are defined either ( i ) on the same or ( ii ) on different subsystems of the dmrg partitioning of the active orbital space into the active ( sub)system , its environment ( the complementary subsystem ) , and one or two explicitly treated orbitals in between . while the former case is straightforward to handle , for an operator expression in the latter case , however , we need to build operators for the superblock where all three subsystems , i.e. , the active subsystem , the exactly represented sites and the environment , are combined as tensor products .    to illustrate this concept , let us consider two operators @xmath38 and @xmath39 defined on three different subspaces @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .",
    "then , the combined subspace @xmath43 is defined as @xmath44 , where @xmath43 as well as @xmath40 , @xmath45 and @xmath42 are all subspaces of the @xmath12-particle fock space @xmath46 .",
    "for instance , the operator expressions for the combined subspace are given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the anticommutation matrix of the corresponding subspace @xmath49 .",
    "for the product of two operators we obtain @xmath50 where we have used the mixed - product property for the right - hand side of the above equation which mixes the ordinary matrix product with the tensor product .",
    "all remaining operator products can be derived in a similar way .",
    "after the spin density matrix is determined , the spatially resolved spin density distribution can be calculated from eq.([eq : sd_def ] ) .",
    "if the wave function is real , the spin density matrix is symmetric and the calculation can be speed up by calculating the upper triangular part of the spin density matrix only .",
    "since ci vectors are in general sparse @xcite  if contributions below a predefined threshold are neglected  casci - type wave functions can be efficiently and accurately projected onto a smaller set of slater determinants , which only represent the most important contributions to the wave function expansion .",
    "we recently reported the sampling - reconstruction algorithm for casci - type wave functions defined in a complete active orbital space from a previously optimized dmrg wave function ( srcas algorithm ) @xcite .",
    "an approximate casci - type expansion @xmath51 for any wave function @xmath33 consisting of @xmath30 one - particle states can thus be written as @xmath52 living in the sampled subspace of the total many - particle hilbert space .",
    "using eq.([eq : sd_matrix_def ] ) , we can calculate the spin density matrix by substituting the reference state @xmath33 with the approximate state @xmath51 , @xmath53)}_{pq } & = \\langle \\tilde{\\psi}_m \\vert \\hat{t}_{pq } \\vert \\tilde{\\psi}_m \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2 } \\langle \\tilde{\\psi}_m \\vert a^\\dagger_{p\\alpha}a_{q\\alpha } - a^\\dagger_{p\\beta}a_{q\\beta } \\vert \\tilde{\\psi}_m\\rangle \\nonumber\\\\ & = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{\\{\\tilde{\\bf n}\\ } , \\{\\widetilde{\\bf m}\\ } }   c_{\\{\\tilde{\\bf n}\\}}^{(m ) * }   c^{(m)}_{\\{\\tilde{\\bf m}\\ } }    \\langle \\tilde{\\bf n } \\vert a^\\dagger_{p\\alpha}a_{q\\alpha } - a^\\dagger_{p\\beta}a_{q\\beta } \\vert \\widetilde{\\bf m } \\rangle.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the occupation number vectors are orthonormal to each other , the expectation value on the right hand side of eq.([eq : sd_matrix_approx ] ) can be easily evaluated and we obtain @xmath54)}_{pq } & = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{\\{\\tilde{\\bf n}\\ } , \\{\\widetilde{\\bf m}\\ } }   c_{\\{\\tilde{\\bf n}\\}}^{(m ) * }   c^{(m)}_{\\{\\widetilde{\\bf m}\\ } }    \\left(\\epsilon_{pq\\alpha } \\delta_{\\tilde{\\bf n}_{\\widehat{p\\alpha } } \\widetilde{\\bf m}_{\\widehat{q\\alpha } } } -   \\epsilon_{pq\\beta } \\delta_{\\tilde{\\bf n}_{\\widehat{p\\beta } } \\widetilde{\\bf m}_{\\widehat{q\\beta } } } \\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 represents the occupation number vector where orbital @xmath36 lacks one electron with @xmath19 spin .",
    "furthermore , we introduced a phase factor @xmath56 to account for the annihilation operations of @xmath57 acting on the bra - state and @xmath58 acting on the ket - state .",
    "based on this approximate expression for the spin density matrix we can determine spin density distributions for subspaces of the many - particle hilbert space of different dimensions and study the sensitivity of the spin density distribution to the number of active - system states in dmrg calculations .      for various reasons , we need suitable measures to assess the similarity of different spin densities .",
    "for instance , such a measure would be required to assess the accuracy of a given spin density compared to a reference spin density .    monitoring the evolution of the spin density for an increasing number of active - system states @xcite can illustrate the convergence behavior of the spin density distribution with respect to the number of active - system states @xmath59 .",
    "isosurface plots of the difference in spin density distributions for calculations with different @xmath59-values can only serve as a qualitative convergence measure . as quantitative measures ,",
    "however , we introduce two distances which quantify how far two spin densities are apart from each other .",
    "both distance measures are defined with the absolute error in the spin density difference distribution .",
    "the accumulated absolute error @xmath60 is given by @xmath61 and the root - square error @xmath62 reads @xmath63 where @xmath64 refers to the spin density distribution corresponding to some calculation @xmath11 , e.g. , to a casscf or dmrg spin density when different chemical methods are compared , or to some parameter sets if different spin densities are determined with the same method . if two spin densities @xmath64 and @xmath65 are similar , both @xmath60 and @xmath62 approach zero . for accurate _ ab initio _ spin densities",
    ", we shall require both error measures to be smaller than 0.005 ( @xmath60 ) or 0.001 ( @xmath62 ) , respectively ( in view of the results discussed in section [ sec : single_ref ] ) .",
    "a different similarity measure can be applied by employing directly the knowledge of the reconstructed casci - type wave function expansion .",
    "this procedure relies on the closeness measure of two quantum states , namely the quantum fidelity @xcite .",
    "the importance and potential application of the quantum fidelity within the dmrg framework was first discussed by some of us @xcite in the context of quantum error correction and was also utilized in our srcas approach @xcite .",
    "two casci - type wave function expansions reconstructed for different numbers of dmrg active - system states , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , can be explicitly compared by calculating their quantum fidelity @xmath68 as an overlap measure .",
    "in a previous study , we reported dft and casscf spin density distributions in iron nitrosyl complexes as well as for the [ fe(no)]@xmath6 molecule embedded in a square - planar field of point - charges to emulate the one - electron states of the full complexes @xcite . since dft spin densities of iron nitrosyl complexes remain ambiguous , we choose the small [ fe(no)]@xmath6 molecule in its doublet state for our analysis here .",
    "the point charges facilitate a dynamic change of the character of the electronic wave function by shortening the distances @xmath69 of the point charges to the metal center . depending on this distance @xmath69",
    ", both single - reference and multi - reference situations can be created for [ fe(no)]@xmath6 . when the four point charges are located at a distance of 1.131  from the iron atom , the electronic structure of the [ fe(no)]@xmath6 molecule represents a single - reference problem , while for @xmath70  a multi - reference case is generated .",
    "the [ fe(no)]@xmath6 structure features a fe  n bond length of 1.707  and a n  o bond distance of 1.177  with a fe ",
    "n  o angle of 146@xmath71 .",
    "the four negative point charges of @xmath720.5 @xmath73 each are located as depicted in figure  [ fig : feno_dens](e ) . due to the small size of the [ fe(no)]@xmath6 molecule",
    ", we can efficiently study the dependence of the spin density distribution on different dmrg parameter sets such as the number of dmrg active - system states @xmath59 .",
    "thereby , we are able to define appropriate convergence measures for the spin density in order to reach a predefined accuracy .      as already discussed in great detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , the minimal active orbital space for [ fe(no)]@xmath6 with @xmath74  comprises seven electrons correlated in seven orbitals for qualitatively reliable spin density distributions .",
    "it consists of fe @xmath75- ( @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 ) and both no @xmath81-orbitals . as orbital basis in our dmrg calculations , the natural orbitals from a cas(7,7)scf calculation performed with the molpro program package @xcite using dunning s cc - pvtz basis set for all atoms",
    "@xcite were taken .",
    "the one - electron and two - electron integrals in the natural orbital basis were also calculated with the molpro program package @xcite .",
    "all dmrg calculations reported in this section [ sec : test ] were carried out with the zurich dmrg program @xcite .",
    "random noise was added to the density matrix in order to force the mixing of configurations that would have not been captured otherwise if the number of active - system states @xmath59 is too small @xcite .",
    "we performed dmrg calculations for different numbers of dmrg active - system states @xmath59 abbreviated by dmrg(@xmath82,@xmath83)[@xmath59 ] where @xmath82 corresponds to the number of active electrons and @xmath83 is the number of active orbitals for @xmath59 renormalized active - system states .",
    "starting with @xmath85 , @xmath59 is further increased to 32 and 48 until the cas(7,7)scf reference energy is reproduced for @xmath86 active - system states ( see table [ tab : energiesfeno ] ) .",
