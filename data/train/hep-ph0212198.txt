    "it is believed that in the very early stages after a heavy ion collision , gluon occupation numbers are as large as @xmath4 , @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "as the qcd quark - gluon plasma evolves toward equilibrium , occupation numbers decrease until @xmath6 at equlibrium . understanding the evolution of dense quark - gluon matter toward equilibrium is both practically important and theoretically challenging .",
    "so long as @xmath7 the boltzmann equation , with elastic and inelastic collision terms and quantum - statistical factors , should furnish a systematic theoretical framework for this problem  @xcite , although this equation can not be expected to be useful at the earliest times after the collision when @xmath5 . on the other hand ,",
    "when occupation numbers are large one can expect classical field theory to apply , and there is currently an interesting program studying the early stages after a heavy ion collision using classical yang - mills equations with an initial condition fixed by the mclerran - venugopalan saturation model  @xcite . thus one might expect that classical field theory should be a good theoretical framework for studying a dense gluon system up to times just before equilibration occurs .",
    "it would seem then that classical field theory and the boltzmann equation are equivalent frameworks for studying dense non - equilibrium qcd in the period where @xmath8 holds for the important phase space region of the system .",
    "while this equivalence have been studied previously , most notably in connection with wave turbulence  @xcite , it is less familiar in the context of the early stages of heavy ion collision .",
    "we thus explore this equivalence in detail in this paper .",
    "to simplify the discussion we deal with a @xmath9 field theory rather than with qcd , but we believe our argumentation should work equally well for yang - mills theories .",
    "our goal is to derive the collision term in the boltzmann equation using only classical field theory , and we do this explicitly at lowest order in the coupling for the elastic - scattering part of the collision term .",
    "this part of the collision term , illustrated in fig .",
    "( [ fig5 ] ) below , has a contribution cubic in the occupation number and a contribution which is quadratic .",
    "perhaps surprisingly we are able to reproduce both of these parts from the classical theory , and the reasons for this are discusssed briefly at the end of sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] . for inelastic parts of the collision term the classical field description can not be expected to give the complete answer , even at the lowest nontrivial term in the coupling , but it should give these portions having the maximum and maximum minus one powers of the occupation number .    in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we review the description of a non - equilibrium system , described by a @xmath9 field theory including the usual doubling of the number of fields . when the fields are large we show how a classical field theory naturally replaces the quantum field theory description of the system , and we introduce combinations of the field variables to make the classical description transparent .    in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we introduce green s functions in the classical field theory and write equations of motions for the green s functions . if the medium does not vary too rapidly we show how a boltzmann - like equation emerges with a `` collision term '' given by green s functions of the classical theory , depending of course on the initial ensemble defining the system .    in sec .",
