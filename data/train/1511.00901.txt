    "explosive thermonuclear burning of fuel accreted from a companion star onto the surface of a white dwarf or neutron star gives rise to the astrophysical phenomena known as classical novae and type i x - ray bursts ( xrbs ) , respectively . within the galaxy ,",
    "several hundred novae have been discovered to date along with @xmath11 systems exhibiting xrbs .",
    "a typical nova explosion ejects @xmath12 @xmath13 of material into the interstellar medium . through spectroscopic analysis",
    "the chemical composition of this ejected material can , in principle , be compared to nova model predictions .",
    "the composition of the ejecta , if any , from xrbs is still unclear .",
    "nonetheless , xrb models suggest that the energy released during xrbs as well as the time structure of the light curves may serve to probe details of these explosions . in both cases , however , model predictions of observables depend upon various factors , including the assumed accretion rate , the composition of the accreted material , the mass and composition of the underlying compact object , and the nuclear reaction rates adopted . for reviews , see , e.g. , ref .",

    "the @xmath3f(@xmath4)@xmath0o and @xmath0o(@xmath1)@xmath2ne reaction rates have significant and demonstrated impact on the predicted abundance of radioactive @xmath3f in novae and the profiles of xrb light curves , respectively .",
    "the former is of interest as the decay of @xmath3f ( t@xmath14 = 110 min ) could provide a detectable , prompt @xmath15-ray signature of a nova at and below 511 kev through electron - positron annihilation@xcite .",
    "the distance at which this emission may be detected by a suitable instrument aboard a satellite , however , depends upon the amount of @xmath3f produced during the explosion , and the @xmath3f(@xmath4)@xmath0o reaction is the principal means of destruction of @xmath3f at temperatures encountered in novae . as to the @xmath0o(@xmath1)@xmath2ne reaction",
    ", xrb models have revealed that the adopted rate has a strong impact not only on the predicted peak luminosity of a burst@xcite , but also on whether bursting behaviour or stable burning is predicted@xcite .",
    "for a recent review of the impact of nuclear physics uncertainties on predicted yields and light curves from novae and xrbs , see ref.@xcite .    direct measurement of the @xmath3f(@xmath4)@xmath0o and @xmath0o(@xmath1)@xmath2ne reactions at all relevant energies above the proton and alpha particle thresholds in @xmath2ne ( s@xmath16 = 6410 kev , s@xmath17 = 3528 kev@xcite ) is not yet possible due to the lack of sufficiently intense radioactive @xmath3f and @xmath0o beams ( see ref.@xcite for progress with the former case ) .",
    "indirect methods must therefore be exploited : nuclear structure information is required for states within @xmath18(@xmath19 mev and @xmath20 mev to estimate the relevant rates of the @xmath3f(@xmath4)@xmath0o and @xmath0o(@xmath1)@xmath2ne reactions , respectively .",
    "in particular , excitation energies , @xmath8 values , total widths , and proton , alpha particle , and @xmath15-ray partial widths are needed . despite considerable experimental and theoretical effort to better constrain these rates ( see , e.g. , refs.@xcite and references within ) , the nuclear physics uncertainties are still sufficient to affect , for example , predictions of @xmath3f production in novae by at least a factor of two@xcite and predictions of peak xrb luminosities by a factor of @xmath21@xcite .    in the present work we have measured the @xmath2f(@xmath7he , t)@xmath2ne reaction to address several outstanding issues regarding the nuclear physics input used in current estimates of the @xmath3f(@xmath4)@xmath0o and @xmath0o(@xmath1)@xmath2ne rates in classical novae and xrbs , respectively .",
    "these include ( a ) measuring , for the first time , the @xmath8 values of the @xmath18(@xmath2ne ) = 4.14 and 4.20 mev levels , as well as of several other levels above the @xmath0o+@xmath22 threshold@xcite ; ( b ) searching for several predicted@xcite , but yet unobserved levels near the @xmath3f+p threshold ; and , ( c ) investigating the triplet at 6.4 mev , as well as a possible doublet at 6.3 mev , through a measurement with better energy resolution than our previous study@xcite , in which these issues were first identified .",

    "the spin - parity assignments from the present work are in general consistent with previous , tentative values . with regard to estimates of the @xmath0o(@xmath1)@xmath2ne rate in xrbs , the assumptions of ref.@xcite for @xmath8 values of levels between 4.0 and 5.1 mev are all in agreement with our experimental results .",
    "the assumptions of ref.@xcite differ in the interchange of the assignments to the 4.14 and 4.20 mev levels ; as discussed in ref.@xcite , there had been compelling reasons for either choice .",
    "we note that the quality of the best fits to the 4.60 mev level has negligible impact on the rate as the @xmath22 decay branching ratio and mean lifetime have been measured by several groups ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) . with our results ,",
    "we favor the @xmath0o(@xmath1)@xmath2ne rate reported in ref.@xcite over that in ref.@xcite .",

    "this is of interest for the @xmath3f(@xmath4)@xmath0o rate as if one member of this possible doublet is @xmath8 = @xmath50 , it will interfere as a subthreshold resonance with other @xmath50 resonances near the proton threshold , leading to additional uncertainties in the rate due to the unknown sign of the interference@xcite",
    ". if the state is broad , on the other hand , its measured angular distribution seems inconsistent with @xmath50@xcite .",
    "the lack of any indication of two components from the angular distribution of this structure seems to support the latter option : a broad state that is not @xmath50 .",
    "this is in accord with results from ref.@xcite , in which a single , @xmath50 level at 6.29 mev would be expected to have a width @xmath70 smaller than our measured width , based on candidate levels in the mirror nucleus @xmath2f .",
    "we also note that the good agreement in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) of the measured angular distributions of the 4034 and 7076 kev states with the theoretical @xmath50 calculation supports the conclusions in ref.@xcite that none of the members of the triplet of states around 6.4 mev appears to be @xmath50 , while two subthreshold states around 6.1 mev may be @xmath50 .",
    "finally , our data suggest that one or more new levels may exist near the 6.86 mev state",
    ". this would not be unexpected given that three as yet unobserved levels within @xmath18(@xmath2ne ) = @xmath71 mev have been predicted based upon comparison with the @xmath2f mirror nucleus , including two broad states , with widths of 22 and 96 kev@xcite .",
    "as well , the non - selective nature of the ( @xmath7he , t ) reaction at these beam energies makes this an ideal mechanism by which new states may be observed .",
    "high resolution studies are needed to better determine the nature of the states at 6.29 and 6.86 mev .",
    "as to the @xmath3f(@xmath4)@xmath0o rate , the current uncertainties in the structure of @xmath2ne around the proton threshold make estimates below @xmath72 kev ( the lowest energy at which direct measurements exist@xcite ) unreliable , with uncertainties that are difficult to quantify .",
    "to improve estimates of the thermonuclear rates of the @xmath3f(@xmath4)@xmath0o and @xmath0o(@xmath1)@xmath2ne reactions at temperatures encountered in classical novae and type i x - ray bursts , respectively , we have measured the @xmath2f(@xmath7he , t)@xmath2ne reaction at 25 mev using a high - resolution magnetic spectrograph .",
    "we find the levels at @xmath18(@xmath2ne ) = 4.14 and 4.20 mev to be consistent with @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively .",
    "this is in agreement with the tentative assignments in the compilation by ref.@xcite and the values assumed for the @xmath0o(@xmath1)@xmath2ne rate estimate by ref.@xcite , but not with the values assumed in the rate estimate by ref.@xcite .",
    "we have also measured the @xmath8 values of four other levels at 4.55 , 4.60 , 4.71 , and 7.17 mev and we find them to be consistent with previous , tentative assignments@xcite .",
    "a new measurement to both confirm the @xmath22 decay branching ratios reported in ref.@xcite , as well as to determine the @xmath22 decay branching ratios of the 4.14 and 4.20 mev levels separately , would help to improve new estimates of the @xmath0o(@xmath1)@xmath2ne rate .",
    "our data also indicate the presence of several of the predicted @xmath2ne levels near the @xmath3f+p threshold@xcite .",
    "we confirm the triplet of states recently observed around 6.4 mev@xcite , propose that the subthreshold 6.29 mev state is either a doublet or a broad state , and suggest that the region around the 6.86 mev state be a target for future high resolution studies to possibly identify additional states . indeed , in the absence of suitably intense @xmath3f beams to extend direct @xmath3f(@xmath4)@xmath0o measurements@xcite to lower energies , we strongly encourage new indirect studies near the @xmath3f+p threshold to confirm or measure the number of states , their @xmath8 values@xcite , and their proton decay branching ratios@xcite .",
