    "massless dirac fermions arise often in the effective theories of condensed matter .",
    "the fermi surface reduces to just two points in one dimension ( @xmath0 ) , and graphene , @xmath4-flux state , and their generalizations provide realizations in the dimensions two and three.@xcite p - wave and d - wave superconductors represent yet another class of important examples.@xcite in the presence of some externally or dynamically generated order parameter ( op ) dirac fermions may become gapped , with the gap appearing as a mass - term in the dirac hamiltonian .",
    "indeed , in any isotropic and time - reversal invariant dirac system in @xmath2 , such as graphene , it is known that there are precisely 36 such linearly independent masses @xcite , which stand for various components of four insulating and four superconducting ops @xcite .",
    "a pair of these masses may either commute or anticommute , with the latter ones being particularly interesting : they add in squares in the expression for the total gap , and this way cooperate in the reduction of the energy of the filled fermi sea .",
    "the examples of such pairs in graphene include the two phase components of any superconducting ( sc ) order , or two spin components of the n ' eel op , or of the quantum spin - hall ( qsh ) topological insulator . in principle , there exist numerous other and more exotic possibilities for such compatible ops , in which one mass may even be insulating while the other is superconducting .",
    "@xcite    it is well - known that the domain walls and the vortex configurations in the masses of dirac quasiparticles in @xmath1 and @xmath2 may carry electrical charge and/or spin.@xcite the simplest way to understand this is on the example of insulating masses , when the electric charge represents a good quantum number : for spin-1/2 fermions there are then two zero - modes of the dirac equation , which when fully ( half ) occupied yield an integrated vortex charge of one ( zero ) and spin zero ( 1/2 ) . on the other hand , if the vortex configuration is in the sc order , for example , the particle number is not conserved , and the vortex charge is zero on average .",
    "nevertheless , the existence of zero - modes of the dirac hamiltonian always leads to a non - trivial internal structure of the vortex , which , however , is independent of its electrical and rotational properties . here",
    "we discuss such an _ additional _ quantum number that generally emerges inside these topological defects , and which may be understood as their  isospin \" .",
    "in particular , we investigate how the definition , value , and the physical nature of the isospin depends on the type of defect and the dimension of space in which it is embedded .",
    "special cases of the isospin components have already been identified in graphene : a ) a vortex in the easy - plane n ' eel order was claimed to contain the hard - axis n ' eel component@xcite , and b ) the s - wave sc vortex was argued to develop either a density - wave ( dw ) @xcite or the qsh state @xcite in its core .",
    "we generalize here these early examples , and in doing so , in particular , reconcile the seemingly conflicting results or refs . @xcite and @xcite quoted above .",
    "we set up and discuss the most general formulation of this problem , and find that , whereas the ops that constitute the isospins are dependent on detail , their number and algebra is universal and _ larger _ than previously found .",
    "it is independent of the nature of the ops twisted into the defect , as long as their representative masses anticommute .",
    "it is also independent of the dimension of the system , if the defect is a topologically non - trivial mapping of the system s boundary onto the op s target space .",
    "the structure we reveal is thus identical for a domain wall in a single mass in @xmath1,@xcite a vortex configuration in two anticommuting masses in @xmath2,@xcite or a hedgehog in three mutually anticommuting masses in @xmath3.@xcite    what we find is _ six _ possible linearly independent ops in the core of the defect , which close the clifford algebra @xmath5,@xcite but with only the averages of the linear combinations of the orders belonging to the _ same _ factor algebra as finite .",
    "this implies that the defects in question always carry a single effective isospin degree of freedom , with the quantum number of @xmath6 .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the values of the real spin and the electrical charge of the defect , which both , and as we will see , even simultaneously , can average to zero .",
    "the mathematical basis of this result lies in the somewhat arcane theory of _ real _ representations of clifford algebras.@xcite the appearance of _ two _ potentially non - zero isospins , in particular , follows from the quternionic nature of the representations relevant to lattice fermions of spin-1/2 . on the experimental side , the complementary order in the defect s core should be visible as a local mass - gap in the scanning tunneling microscopy .",
    "the existence of the isospin could lead to new ways of manipulation of the defects by the external probes that would couple to this particular degree of freedom .",
    "for example , the op for the kekule bond - dw order parameter couples to the pseudomagnetic field that derives from the wrinkles in the graphene sheet the same way the usual electric charge density couples to the real magnetic field .",
    "the possibility that defects in one op carry with them quantum numbers of another is also suggestive of an exotic quantum phase transition from their proliferation .",
    "@xcite    a reconsideration of the defects in the insulating ops becomes particularly interesting in light of our results , which imply that one of the potential isospins consists of a single insulating and two superconducting components .",
    "the average electric charge of such a defect is a continuous variable between zero and one .",
    "the chemical potential in this case polarizes the isospin in the direction of the insulating component .",
    "it therefore causes the isospin to _ precess _ , which translates into a periodic time - dependence of the local _ superconducting _ phase .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we define the dirac - nambu hamiltonian in two dimensions , and discuss the consequences of the particle - hole symmetry , particularly of its antilinearity .",
    "the vortex hamiltonian is then studied in sec .",
    "in particular , in this section we show that the maximal clifford algebra that contains the two gamma- and two mass - matrices appearing in the vortex hamiltonian is closely related to @xmath7 . a generalization to other dimensions and the connection to wess - zumino - witten term",
    "is briefly described in sec .",
    "iv . the way the isospin develops a non - zero expectation value from the zero - modes , and its further unitary evolution in time are considered in sec . v. some examples are provided in sec .",
    "the connection between the isospin on one side , and the usual spin and the electric charge on the other is discussed in the closing section , where we also summarize the main results . in the appendices we provide the derivation of the majorana representation used throughout the paper and give an elementary discussion of the crucial mathematical fact about the clifford algebra @xmath7 , that is its quaternionic nature",
    "to derive the isospin we take @xmath2 and generalize to other spatial dimensions afterwards .",
    "assume a space- and time - inversion invariant system of spin-1/2 fermions on a lattice , with the dirac point / points in its band structure , such as graphene .",
    "the dirac hamiltonian for all low - energy excitations near the dirac points will then have the standard form @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 are _ eight - dimensional _ hermitian matrices satisfying the anticommutation relation @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the usual momentum operator . the dimension eight may be understood as arising , in graphene , for example , from two sublattices , two valleys , and two spin projections , but it is in fact required more generally by the time reversal invariance , as discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . to give a unified description of both the insulating and the superconducting mass - gaps one must double the number of fermionic components , include both particles and holes into the dirac spinor , and consider the _ sixteen - dimensional _ massive  dirac - nambu \" hamiltonian @xmath13 where , as usual , the kinetic energy part is @xmath14 and the matrices @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xmath10 are hermitian .",
    "the symbol  @xmath17 \" stands for an orthogonal sum . to open a mass - gap we require that @xmath18 and @xmath19 , so that the spectrum of @xmath20 is the usual relativistic @xmath21 for @xmath22 uniform .",
    "the dirac - nambu hamiltonian @xmath20 is by construction particle - hole symmetric : it anticommutes with the antilinear operator @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the eight - dimensional unit matrix , @xmath25 are the pauli matrices , and @xmath26 is the complex conjugation . since @xmath27",
    ", a representation exists in which @xmath28 @xcite , and @xmath20 is imaginary .",
    "explicit derivation is provided in appendix 1 . such a representation",
    "could be called  majorana \" , and we will assume it hereafter . in the majorana representation",
    "any mass - matrix @xmath15 is also imaginary . since",
    ", on the other hand , in the coordinate representation the momentum operator @xmath29 is already imaginary , the two sixteen - dimensional matrices @xmath16 , @xmath10 in the kinetic energy are _",
    "real_. the separation of the matrices in the kinetic and mass terms into real and imaginary essentially determines the internal structure of the vortex , as will be discussed shortly .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "let us then assume a real - space vortex configuration in the mass term , @xmath33 with @xmath34 as the polar coordinates , and @xmath35 in eq . 2 and arbitrary .",
    "the only requirements are that the two hermitian matrices @xmath36 and @xmath37 anticommute , @xmath38 , again be imaginary , and anticommuting with the kinetic energy , i.e. @xmath39 .    the spectrum of the hamiltonian @xmath40 now contains _ four _ zero - energy states .",
    "this follows from noticing that the matrices @xmath16 and @xmath41 , @xmath10 which appear in the hamiltonian form a clifford algebra @xmath42 , which , as is well known , has a unique four - dimensional irreducible representation.@xcite the dirac - nambu hamiltonian can therefore be transformed into an orthogonal sum of four identical copies of the jackiw - rossi hamiltonian , which contains one zero - mode in its spectrum.@xcite any operator that anticommutes with the hamiltonian may , depending on its occupation , pick up an expectation value precisely from those zero - energy states @xcite . to understand the internal structure of the vortex we therefore need to find the imaginary hermitian matrices @xmath43 that satisfy @xmath44 @xmath10 , and @xmath45 .    in the majorana representation",
    "the problem is solved by invoking some properties of the real representations of the clifford algebras . to see how this algebraic structure emerges",
    "we first ask how many such _ mutually anticommuting _ mass - matrices @xmath43 exist .",
    "the answer is contained in table i , where we extracted and summarized the required information from ref .",
    "@xcite , both on the dimensionality and the type of the irreducible _ real _ representations of the clifford algebras @xmath30 . since @xmath16 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 are all real , and @xmath48 and @xmath49 , we need to determine the maximal value of @xmath32 so that for @xmath50 the dimensionality of the real representation of @xmath30 is sixteen .",
    "an examination of the table immediately implies that the maximal @xmath51 , as observed already in the ref .",
    "there are thus _ three _ additional mutually anticommuting masses : @xmath52 , so that the set @xmath53 , @xmath10 , @xmath54 provides a real irreducible sixteen - dimensional representation of @xmath7 .",
    "this is not all , however . the essential feature of the real representation of @xmath7 is that it is _ quaternionic _ : besides the usual unit matrix , there exist three non - trivial linearly independent sixteen dimensional matrices which commute with the whole representation .",
    "this facilitates the construction of three _ additional _ solutions : @xmath55 . while mutually anticommuting ( @xmath56 ) , these solutions _ commmute _ with the first three : @xmath57 = 0 $ ] , for @xmath58 .",
    "the mathematical details of this construction are provided in appendix 2 .",
    "all possible  five - tuplets \" of anticommuting masses which respect the particle - hole symmetry have been listed with the help of a computer in ref .",
    "@xcite . from this list",
    "it is evident , under close inspection , that each pair of symbols , irrespective of what physical ops they may represent , can be found in exactly _ two _ different five - tuplets .",
    "any set of three , or four , symbols , on the other hand , belongs to a unique five - tuplet .",
    "all of these facts follow from the representation theory as explained above .",
    "the _ six _ masses that we found to anticommute with the dirac - nambu hamiltonian in @xmath2 with a mass - vortex close the algebra @xmath59 , with the four - dimensional hilbert space of zero - energy states @xmath60 as its invariant subspace .",
    "table i implies , however , that this result is independent of the spatial dimensions @xmath0 : since the dimensions of the matrices appearing in the dirac - nambu hamiltonian @xcite are @xmath61 , @xmath0 real @xmath62-matrices and @xmath63 imaginary masses , upon multiplication of the latter by @xmath64 , form a real representation of @xmath65 , which is always quaternionic . assuming the topological defect in @xmath0 of the anticommuting masses",
    "again leaves the algebra of potential core order parameters @xmath5 .",
    "the general result can then be summarized as in fig . 1 .    in any dimension @xmath0 ,",
    "the number of mutually anticommuting masses , @xmath63 , is precisely right for the emergence of the wess - zumino - witten term upon the integration over fermions.@xcite the berry phase of the three ops that can form in the core of the defect of the remaining @xmath0 masses will thus match the one of a spin-1/2-like object , as discussed in @xcite , and in accord with our assignment of the isospin s quantum number .",
    "since the zero - mode subspace @xmath66 is four - dimensional , we may choose a basis in which the first three core ops ( @xmath41 ) are represented by @xmath67 , and the second three ( @xmath68 ) by @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "it would then seem that the averages of both , or possibly none , of the two isospins could be finite in the ground state . that this however , is impossible , is guaranteed by the antilinearity of the particle - hole symmetry in a simple but rather interesting way . consider a perturbed dirac - nambu hamiltonian @xmath71 where @xmath72 is an operator so far neglected , which derives , for example , from the underlying lattice , magnetic field , finite chemical potential , or a similar perturbation .",
    "for small enough parameter @xmath73 we may neglect the mixing of the zero - energy and finite - energy modes , and to the leading order consider only the resulting split of the zero - modes .",
    "we now show that the result of _ any _ such splitting can only be that either @xmath74 and @xmath75 or vice versa .",
    "since in the majorana representation the matrix @xmath72 for _ any _ perturbation is also imaginary , @xmath72 anticommutes with some antilinear operator @xmath76 that represents the particle - hole symmetry within the zero - mode subspace @xmath66 .",
    "introduce the basis in @xmath66 : @xmath77 , with @xmath78 , where @xmath79 , and @xmath80 labels the isospin . if @xmath81 is an eigenvector of the matrix representing @xmath72 in @xmath60 , its eigenvalue has the opposite sign of the eigenvalue of the eigenstate @xmath82 .",
    "the two states are thus orthogonal . since @xmath83 , @xmath80",
    "are also odd under particle - hole symmetry , it follows that within @xmath66 @xmath76 is formally equivalent to the time reversal of spin . in general then , if @xmath84 its particle - hole partner is @xmath85 where @xmath86 .",
    "the orthogonality of the two states implies that @xmath87 which is precisely what disentangles @xmath88 into a _ product state _ : @xmath89 where , in the usual notation , @xmath90 for @xmath91 , and @xmath92 .",
    "if the state @xmath93 corresponds to a negative eigenvalue of @xmath72 , the state @xmath94 corresponds to a positive eigenvalue .",
    "since the other two eigenstates are also the product states , and need to be orthogonal to the first two , there are just two options : it is either that the state @xmath95 has then the negative energy , and @xmath96 positive , or vice versa . in the former case , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 .",
    "the state of the isospins may thus be understood as a _ mixture _ , given by the statistical operator ( i.e. the density matrix ) @xmath99 in the latter case , of course , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 .",
    "the state of the two isospins is a product of the maximal mixture ( @xmath102 ) for one , and the pure state ( @xmath103 ) for the other isospin .",
    "the unitary evolution can not exchange the two isospins : if @xmath98 @xmath104 , for example , it remains zero at @xmath105 . to see this ,",
    "assume that the isospin s state initially is @xmath106 with a general statistical operator @xmath107 .",
    "it evolves according to the schrdinger equation @xmath108.\\ ] ] the particle - hole symmetry implies that in general the perturbation , which may be time - dependent , within the zero - mode subspace has the form @xmath109 where @xmath110 are time - dependent projectors on some one - dimensional subspaces of the first and the second isospin , and @xmath111 and @xmath112 are arbitrary functions of time .",
    "the time - dependent state is therefore @xmath113 , with @xmath114,\\ ] ] and , as evident , @xmath98 at all times .",
    "the topological defects thus ultimately carry with them _ a single _ non - trivial isospin-1/2 , of the physical size of the spatial extent of the zero - modes , which is @xmath115 .",
    "the ops forming the components of the isospin depend on the system .",
    "let us consider some examples next , starting from the most familiar .",
    "let us consider graphene ( @xmath2 ) , as an example .",
    "if the vortex configuration is in the two components of the s - wave sc , core s isospin components are the charge - dw and the two singlet bond - dws,@xcite or the three components of the qsh state @xcite .",
    "the real spin in the former case is zero .",
    "if the superconductor is a spin singlet , as in this example , one of the isospins must be a vector under rotations , since all three spin - rotation generators commute with the hamiltonian , and will appear as the casimir operators @xmath116 in fig .",
    "1 , for one of the isospins . obviously , in this case it is the qsh state that carries the ( true ) spin 1/2 , which is why it is favored by the zeeman term in presence of the magnetic field.@xcite in general , if the matrices @xmath36 and @xmath37 in eq . ( 4 ) represent two phase components of some superconducting order,@xcite all six core s ops are insulating .",
    "the electric charge is not a good quantum number , but on average it always vanishes , independently of the state of isospin .",
    "the lattice itself , for example , favors the bond - dw in the core : this is thus an example of a vortex with vanishing both ( average ) charge and true spin , and with only the _ isospin _ left as finite .",
    "the situation changes if one twists two spin components of a triplet sc ; @xmath117 and @xmath118 components of the f - wave sc in graphene , @xcite for example .",
    "each potential isospin then has a single insulating and two superconducting components : 1 ) cdw , s - wave sc , @xmath119 component of the f - wave sc , and 2 ) @xmath119 components of n ' eel , and two kekule triplet superconducting states . in either case",
    "the vortex core may stay superconducting by simply changing the type of the superconducting state , i. e. by forming a _ texture_. neither electric charge nor spin are good quantum numbers in this case , but the isospin is well - defined .",
    "next , consider a vortex configuration in two insulating ops , when the particle number , and hence the electric charge , is a good quantum number .",
    "for instance , the spin - singlet ( kekule ) bond - dw @xcite is favored by the coupling to in - plane optical phonon at the dirac point in graphene , and has been proposed as a candidate for the op in the magnetic field.@xcite the isospin components in the vortex configuration in this case are , 1 ) the three components of the n ' eel op , or 2 ) the charge - dw and the two phase components of the s - wave sc . the vortex is ( spin ) rotational symmetric , and the spin is 1/2 and zero , respectively .",
    "the electric charge for the first isospin is zero .    before discussing the electric charge of the second isospin ,",
    "let us consider the vortex formed out of the @xmath117 and @xmath118 components of the n ' eel op , favored by the hubbard on - site repulsion.@xcite one set of isospin components contains the @xmath119-component of the same n ' eel order @xcite and two spin - singlets bond - dws , and the other consists of the @xmath119-component of the qsh state and the two phase components of the @xmath119-component of the f - wave triplet sc @xcite .",
    "spin is not a good quantum number .    in both examples introduced above ,",
    "one isospin ( call it @xmath120 ) is purely insulating , whereas the second one ( @xmath121 ) has one insulating and two superconducting components .",
    "it is easy to see that this is in general true ; the particle number is conserved , and thus the number operator must be one of the casimir operators , let s say @xmath122 in fig .",
    "the masses @xmath123 and @xmath124 must then stand for two phase components of some superconducting order , rotated into each other by a transformation generated by the number operator .    let us further assume that in the presence of some perturbation we found @xmath125 , where @xmath126 , with @xmath127 as the insulating component of the second isospin .",
    "the particle number operator within @xmath60 is then also @xmath128 , and the average of the vortex electric charge is @xmath129 . of course ,",
    "in this example the charge will be sharp only if @xmath130 , which will be the case if the perturbation in question is the chemical potential @xmath131 , for instance . in the ground state",
    "then @xmath130 , and the charge is back to unity .",
    "one can imagine , however , that a proximity to another superconductor could  polarize \" the core so that @xmath132 . at a finite chemical potential",
    "the superconducting phase will then oscillate as @xmath133 , whereas @xmath134 is constant , just as in the precession of an ordinary spin .",
    "our results do not , however , readily apply to a superconducting vortex on an isolated surface of a topological insulator , if the original fermion has only two components .",
    "after the particle - hole doubling the dimension of the matrices involved becomes four , and table i implies that for @xmath135 the maximal value of @xmath32 is only two .",
    "the set of the core s order parameters is simply empty , in accord with the single zero - energy majorana state being pinned to the chemical potential.@xcite if we consider a thin film geometry with two possibly coupled surfaces , however , the dimension of the dirac - nambu hamiltonian doubles to eight , and the maximal value of @xmath32 increases to @xmath136 .",
    "the situation still differs qualitatively from the one we studied hitherto in that there is now a single isospin in the core , and with the discrete ising , and not heisenberg symmetry .",
    "if the vortex is in the s - wave sc , for example , one finds that the core s ising isospin is the time - reversal - invariant exciton of ref .",
    "to conclude , we showed that some typical topological defects in the presence of dirac fermions , besides their usual electric charge and true spin , which , depending on the defect , may or may not be finite , always possess a non - zero isospin .",
    "the components of the isospin are the local masses , i. e. order parameters , that develop a finite expectation value in the center of the defects . while in principle two",
    "different such isospins are always possible , only one can have a non - trivial quantum number in a given physical situation . this new degree of freedom couples to different external probes , and in principle could be manipulated similarly to the electron spin",
    ".    the connection between the isospin , discussed here , and the electrical charge and the true spin of the vortex now becomes transparent . a particular split of the zero - modes favored by the perturbations to the dirac hamiltonian will result in a component of one of the two possible isospins developing a non - zero average value ; say , for instance , @xmath137 .",
    "the vortex is thus by this mechanism _ spontaneously _ turned into a meron .",
    "there is a unique non - trivial symmetry generator that commutes both with the vortex hamiltonian , and with the matrix @xmath138 : it is @xmath122 in fig .",
    "1 . the commutation relations between the six masses @xmath41 and @xmath139 and the six casimir operators @xmath140 and @xmath141 imply , however , that _ within the zero - mode subspace _ , @xmath122 and @xmath138 are represented by the same matrix , and therefore it is also @xmath142",
    ". the matrix @xmath122 can be the number operator , in which case the latter average would be proportional to the density of the electric charge .",
    "it can also be the generator of rotations of the electron spin , in which case the vortex will have the spin 1/2 .",
    "the examples of both were discussed in the previous section . but @xmath122 can also be _",
    "neither_. for a singlet - sc vortex on graphene s honeycomb lattice , for example , if the non - zero isospin is kekule bond - dw , @xmath122 will be one of the generators of valley rotations .",
