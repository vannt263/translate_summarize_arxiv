    "the aquila rift forms a great mass of dark clouds along the summer milky way through the constellations aquila , serpens , and eastern ophiuchus .",
    "large scale plates several degrees in diameter show almost a continuum of bright background stars along the galactic plane with dark patches of nearly starless dark regions superimposed ( e.g. , figure 1 ) .",
    "this structure is silhouetted in the h@xmath0 images of madsen & reynolds ( 2005 ) and reflected in the h  i map of kawamura et al .",
    "curiously , in spite of the resemblance of these dark clouds to other nearby , low - mass star - forming regions , few young stars have been identified in the eastern ( higher galactic longitude ) portion of the rift . by contrast , the western portion of the aquila rift contains the well - known serpens star - forming region , near galactic longitude 30@xmath1 but substantially above the plane at a latitude of @xmath25@xmath1 .        in this paper",
    "we briefly review the results of millimeter and submillimeter surveys that include the eastern aquila clouds ( section 2 ) , describe the interesting characteristics of the region s known young stars ( section 3 ) , discuss the best estimates for clouds age , distance , and relationship with the known young stars in the area ( section 4 ) , and speculate as to why much larger numbers of young stellar objects are not known to populate the region ( section 5 ) . in section 6",
    "we propose a number of potential observations to determine better aquila s star formation properties . in this chapter",
    "we will focus on the high galactic longitude aquila dark clouds .",
    "we will thus make a distinction between `` aquila '' , by which we mean the region within a few degrees of the galactic plane located approximately between galactic longitudes @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and the larger `` aquila rift '' cloud structure ( see section 2 ) .    10 to @xmath520  km  s@xmath6 co emission in the first galactic quadrant .",

    "the initial galactic plane co survey of dame & thaddeus ( 1985 ) identified the salient features of the aquila rift and established a connection between the dark nebulae and the molecular clouds in the region .",
    "subsequent improvements to the initial survey ( dame et al .",
    "1987 , 2001 ) increased the sensitivity by more than a factor of 10 , increased the coverage of the co observations from a 4@xmath1 to a 10@xmath1 strip in galactic latitude , and increased the angular resolution to 1/8@xmath1 . in galactic coordinates ,",
    "the aquila rift stretches from 20@xmath1 to 40@xmath1 in longitude and @xmath91@xmath1 to 10@xmath1 in latitude , as demarcated by co and 21  cm hi ( dame et al .",
    "2001 ; figure 2 ) .",
    "the molecular mass of the aquila rift as determined from co observations has been estimated to be between 1.1@xmath10  m@xmath11 and 2.7@xmath10  m@xmath11 ( dame & thaddeus 1985 ; dame et al .",
    "1987 ; straiys et al . 2003 ) . using the molecular line widths and a uniform density sphere approximation , dame & thaddeus calculate the virial mass of the aquila rift to be 2.6@xmath10  m@xmath11 .",
    "the virial mass is then about the same as or slightly greater than the observed mass , depending on the parameters used in the h@xmath12 gas mass estimates , particularly the cloud distance and therefore size and density .",
    "the relationship between the virial mass and the observed mass reflects the star - forming potential of these clouds because , if the virial mass dominates , the cloud is dynamically unstable and unlikely to form stars ( e.g. , solomon et al .",
    "therefore , the ambiguity in the measured mass of the aquila rift is important to follow up with additional millimeter observations and improved distance measurements .",
    "the aquila rift consists of numerous small and large clouds , many of which have been identified and tabulated by lynds ( 1962 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the lynds coordinates are sometimes so uncertain that it is not clear which cloud they refer to .",

    "most studies of vulpecula have focussed on the open cluster in the cloud , ngc 6823 ; at a distance of @xmath50  kpc ( massey 1998 ) only the higher mass stars in this cluster have been well studied ( e.g. , massey et al . 1995 ) .",

    "( 2003 ) and consistent with the range , 2@xmath97 myr , determined by massey ( 1998 ) . however , it is not clear that the open cluster and the vulpecula cloud are associated .",
    "dame & thaddeus ( 1985 ) note that there are two distinct distance scales for this region  that of the ob1 association ( ngc 6823 ) , 2.3  kpc , and that of the local dust , @xmath29400  pc ( neckel et al .",
    "the cluster is likely background to the molecular cloud .",
    "given the large difference in distance between either the dust or the ob1 association in vulpecula and the stars and gas in the aquila region , it is unlikely that there is any direct relationship between these clouds .",
    "vulpecula falls into an interstice between two galactic spiral arms , roughly in the direction of the sun s motion into the first quadrant of the galaxy ( frisch 1998 ) .",
    "this provides a direct line of sight to the high - mass cluster and recommends it for further study .",
    "the scutum region lies a couple degrees below the galactic plane , just south of the aquila rift cloud in an apparent hole in the molecular gas associated with the rift .",
    "the molecular gas velocities of clouds in the direction of scutum , at 40@xmath9120  km  s@xmath6 , are very distinct from those of the aquila rift ( dame et al .",
    "santos et al .",
    "( 2005 ) describe the open cluster , m11 ( ngc 6705 ) , at a distance of 1.9  kpc , as superimposed on the scutum region .",

    "based on the very young ages of the observed stars in aquila , and the abundance of raw materials for star formation present in the region , it is surprising that much larger numbers of young sources are not found .",
    "why did the initial epoch of star formation in this region produce so little ?",
    "the serpens star - forming region in the western part of the aquila rift is rich with hundreds of young stars ( see chapter by eiroa et al . ) . at galactic longitude 33@xmath1 , a distinct shift in the velocity of",
    "the @xmath13co gas appears to demarcate a boundary not only between serpens and aquila , but between young star rich and poor regions , respectively ( figure 7 ) .",
    "why is this the case ?",
    "particularly striking is the eastern portion of the rift that harbors only hbc 684 as far as we know .",
    "possibly large numbers of younger , embedded objects exist within the eastern rift but have so far evaded detection .",
    "this bears further attention , possibly in the form of spitzer surveys , specifically of the eastern rift which appears to be gas - rich but young star poor .",
    "surveys for pre - stellar cores south of the eastern rift have not revealed a large population .    the small sample of young stars in the tw hydrae association ( e.g. rich et al .",
    "1999 ) are also spread out over an area of about 30  pc in diameter ( feigelson & montmerle 1999 ) .",
    "aquila could comprise a similar sort of small association .",
    "tw hydrae members have ages of @xmath2910  myr ; it is conceivable , even likely , that the tw hya stars formed in a much more compact region and have dispersed over a large area over millions of years . in the case of the sparse population of aquila stars ,",
    "however , their @xmath291  myr ages imply that a similar scenario is unlikely .",
    "furthermore , at least the partially embedded stars such as as 353 appear to be located close to where they were formed .",
    "thus , the pre - main sequence population in aquila seems to be comprised of numerous small pockets of star formation .",
    "frisch ( 1998 ) describes the properties of the local interstellar medium within 500 pc of the sun and points out that the _  aquila rift molecular cloud is the node region where all of the superbubble shells from the three epochs of star formation in the scorpius - centaurus association , as well as the most recent supernova explosion creating the north polar spur , converged after plowing into the molecular gas and decelerating . ",
    "_ could these dynamical processes in the aquila region be responsible for the disruption of star formation ? or , alternatively ,",
    "could such processes have triggered only a very limited epoch of star formation ? without a much more exact study and a comprehensive picture of the gas dynamics of the region , it is not possible to evaluate these scenarios ; however , they remain intriguing possibilities .    a more mundane explanation for the dearth of young stars in the aquila molecular cloud may be simply that star formation has , so far , only proceeded in isolated pockets .",
    "if in the region of aquila that lies south of the galactic plane the virial mass exceeded the total gas mass , the complex may have broken up just before or while forming a sporadic distribution of stars .",
    "this is not a fully satisfactory scenario , however , because ample raw materials abound in the eastern rift ( section 2 ) .",
    "perhaps we have simply not yet determined the absolute census of young aquila objects ; the location of these co clouds in the galactic plane comes with contamination from a dense stellar field within which it is highly non - trivial to pick out t  tauri stars ( figure 1 ) .",
    "although this is a challenging undertaking , a detailed survey for young stellar objects may be the most important next step in furthering our understanding of star formation in aquila ( section 6 ) .",
    "objective prism and narrow - band h@xmath0 imaging surveys in aquila should reveal emission line objects , typically associated with accreting young stars . given the high disk fraction ( section 3.5 ) among the known young candidate members , this should reveal a significant portion of the pre - main sequence stellar population , if indeed it is there .",
    "a complementary approach would be to use long - wavelength spitzer observations to detect directly the warm dust in the circumstellar disks of embedded protostars .    in the spirit of stellar characterization",
    ", it would be profitable to understand the true space motions of the known young aquila stars ( ducourant et al . 2005 ) . by determining proper motions and combining these with the recently measured radial velocities",
    ", we will be able to determine the dynamical history of the young stars with far more accuracy .    for those known pre - main sequence stars that are also sufficiently energetic radio sources ( e.g. , as 353 ) ,",
    "very long baseline interferometry can be used to determine very precise stellar distances . there",
    "currently exists an age - distance degeneracy for the aquila young stars , although the obvious signatures of youth constrain them to be below a few myr .",
    "accurate distance determinations would localize not only the stars themselves , but also the associated molecular gas .",
    "millimeter wave surveys at higher angular resolution using isotopes and species which trace the denser regions of gas will provide a more complete picture of the structure and dynamics of the aquila clouds and of how this region connects to the western part of the aquila rift , concurrent with the serpens star - forming region . some preliminary observations of c@xmath18o show that the distribution of this tracer of denser gas is very different from that of @xmath13co .",
    "cores revealed by such observations may provide a guide for the most productive areas in which to search for new or on - going star formation .",
