    "the mean cluster coefficient @xmath21 is by definition an average of local quantities .",

    "we look at three such relations .",
    "the first is a formula of newman , watts and strogatz @xcite which writes @xmath16 as a diffraction coefficient divided by scalar curvature .",
    "this is intuitive already for spheres , where the signal speed and the curvature determines the characteristic length .",
    "empirically , we find an other quantity which also often allows to estimate characteristic length well : it is the mean cluster density @xmath21 , the average of a local cluster density @xmath8 as defined by watts and strogatz .",
    "thirdly , we will report on some experiments which correlate the length - cluster coefficient @xmath37 with the inductive dimension @xmath22 of the graph .",
    "+    the starting point of this note is the observation that the local cluster property @xmath8 if a vertex in a graph can be written in terms of relative characteristic length of the unit sphere @xmath10 within the unit ball @xmath11 .",
    "we are not aware that this has been noted already , but it is remarkable as it allows to carry over the definition of  local cluster property \" to metric spaces equipped with a probability measure as long as the measure has the property that it induces probability measures @xmath38 on spheres by conditional probability @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is an @xmath17 neighborhood of @xmath41 . for such metric spaces , one can also define a cousin of scalar curvature @xmath42 by comparing the measures @xmath43 of spheres of radius @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",

    "since the later is a local function and appears also in a formula of newman , watts and strogatz and because we look at the dimension @xmath3 anyway , it does not matter if for simplicity @xmath14 is called the * scalar curvature * and its average over vertex set is called the * hilbert action * @xmath6 of the graph .",

    "the hilbert action itself is an average of scalar curvature , which can be defined for a large class of metric spaces .",

    "cutting that line in the middle can change both quantities in a very different way depending on the two components which are obtained .",

    "* example 3*. for a two - dimensional sphere of surface area @xmath44 , the characteristic length @xmath16 is @xmath233 times the characteristic length @xmath234 of the unit sphere which is intrinsic and uses the geodesic length within the surface and not from an embedding .",
    "we measure it in @xmath235 to be @xmath236 so that @xmath237 can be computed by using that that the geodesic distance between two points given in spherical coordinates as @xmath238 is given by the haverside formula @xmath239 where @xmath240 is the haverside function .",
    "random points on the sphere can be computed with the uniform distribution in @xmath241 and the @xmath242 distribution in @xmath243 .",
    "assuming the same @xmath8 value as in the plane ( which uses that near a specific point we can replace the sphere with its tangent space ) and get @xmath244 .",
    "dimension plays a role for characteristic length .",
    "we measure experimentally that the global length - cluster ratio quantity @xmath245 is correlated to dimension for erds - renyi graphs :    here is some intuition , why the limit should exist : the cluster coefficient is related to the existence of triangles in the graph . for orbital networks @xcite defined by polynomial maps the number of triangles is bounded by a constant @xmath225 .",
    "this implies that @xmath246 and @xmath247 for orbital networks , we should get that @xmath248 has a finite interval as accumulation points . to show that @xmath1 grows like @xmath160 , we do nt want too many relations @xmath249 with different words @xmath250 .",
    "we call this a collision . if @xmath192 is the number of generators , then , if there were no collisions , the relation @xmath251 holds . with @xmath252",
    "double collisions , assuming no triple collisions , we have the relation @xmath253 and so @xmath254",
    ". together with @xmath255 we have @xmath256 .",
    "so , if we can show @xmath252 to be of the order @xmath160 and the number of triangles to be of the order @xmath257 , and triple collisions are rare , then we should be able to prove that the limit exists .",
    "the space @xmath258 of all graphs on a vertex set with @xmath35 nodes , where every node is turned on with probability @xmath97 is a probability space .",
    "the limit @xmath259 for @xmath260 exists almost surely .",
    "we see that the value is close to @xmath261 , where @xmath108 is the radius of the graph and @xmath262 is the dimension of the network .",
    "+ the quotient  ( [ lengthcluster ] ) is interesting because @xmath16 is a global property and @xmath21 is the average of a local property .",
    "intuitively , such a relation is to be expected because a larger @xmath8 allows to tunnel faster through a ball @xmath11 and allows for shorter paths .",
    "if the limit exists , then @xmath263 . knowing @xmath23 is important because the characteristic length is more costly to compute while the clustering coefficient @xmath225 is easier to determine as a simple average of local quantities .",
    "to allow an analogy from differential geometry , we could compare @xmath8 with curvature , because a metric space with larger curvature has a smaller average distance between two points on the unit sphere .",
    "+ we could look at graphs with a given dimension and volume and minimize the average path length between two points among all graphs . it is a long shot but one can ask whether there is the relation between graphs minimizing @xmath16 and graphs minimizing euler characteristic @xmath158 .",
    "we can only explore this so far for very small graphs .",
    "the reason for asking this is that euler characteristic can also been seen as an average of scalar curvature and therefore a quantized hilbert action @xcite .",
    "variational problems on graphs usually need some constraints because the functionals are often trivial without restrictions",
    ". we can restrict the number of vertices or edges and look at the maximum or minimum on that space .",
    "more generally , we can use a lagrange type problem and look at all the graphs for which one functional is constant and extremize the other on that class .",
    "this leads to more questions and most of them seem not have been studied .",
    "instead of restricting to a  level surface \" we can also look at the functionals on an equivalence class of graphs .",
    "one interesting example is to look at homotopy as an equivalence relation .",
    "a homotopy step @xmath264 is given by choosing a contractible subgraph @xmath106 of @xmath56 and connect each vertex of @xmath106 with a new vertex @xmath265 .",
    "an other homotopy step is the reverse operation : remove a vertex for which the unit sphere is contractible .",
    "the notion of contractible if a sequence of homotopy steps transforms it to a one point graph .",
    "+ lets look at the example of minimizing the dimension @xmath3 in a homotopy class .",
    "the homotopy class of a circle contains graphs of arbitrary large dimension ; it contains for example discretization of a solid torus ( dimension 3 ) or an annulus ( dimension 2 ) .",
    "+ we can also find one - dimensional graphs homotopic to the circle which are not @xmath266 .",
    "we can for example attach one dimensional hairs to the circle without changing dimension , nor homotopy .",
    "we have now a new functional @xmath267 which is the minimal dimension among all graphs @xmath106 homotopic to @xmath56 . for a contractible graph ,",
    "the minimal dimension is @xmath169 . on the class of graphs",
    "homotopic to the circle the minimal dimension is @xmath44 and for all graphs homotopic to an icosahedron it is @xmath45 .",
    "a similar modified dimension @xmath268 can be defined in the continuum : define the homotopy dimension of a space @xmath269 as the minimum of the hausdorff dimensions of all compact metric spaces @xmath219 homotopic to @xmath269 .",
    "+ the question is whether the minimum is always attained by a geometric graph or smooth manifolds ."
