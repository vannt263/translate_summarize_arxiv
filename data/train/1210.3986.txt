    "the analysis of these features reveals which material was ejected and in which quantity . with the recent reduction in mass - loss rates ,",
    "these episodes of enhanced mass - loss have gained more attention , as they seem more crucial than ever in the evolution of massive stars .",
    "another reason to study the close environment of massive stars is to better understand the evolution of supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "indeed , the famous rings of sn1987a may only be understood if one considers the previous mass - loss episodes of the progenitor .",
    "morphology is not the only snr parameter which is affected , as the snr dynamics in an homogeneous medium or in winds and circumstellat ejecta is not identical .    for its study",

    "circumstellar structures around bsgs have been predominantely identified as bow shocks around runaway stars . originally discovered with iras ( e.g. van buren & mccray , 1988 , apj , 329 , l93 ) , such structures have also been seen with msx and wise ( peri et al .",

    "these stars can thus travel at supersonic speeds through the local medium giving rise to `` bow shocks '' as their stellar winds interact with the surrounding medium , which has been previously ionised by stellar photons from the hot star ( weaver 1977 ) .",
    "the occurrence of such bow shocks has been shown to depend primarily on the ism conditions ( huthoff & kaper 2002 ) .",
    "for example , even a runaway star may travel at subsonic speeds in the tenuous interior of a superbubble , where the sound speed can be as much as 100kms@xmath2 , hence no ( detectable ) bow shock will be produced in that case .",
    "the filling factor of ism with @xmath3kms@xmath2 is 20% and 75% of o - stars have velocities @xmath410kms@xmath2 , so the expected fraction of o - stars with bow shocks is @xmath515% .",
    "this is remarkably similar to the values derived from iras and wise observations ( noriega - crespo et al .",
    "1997 , peri et al .",

    "1996 ) , and the stand - off distance between the star and the apex of the shock is determined from the pressure balance between the stellar wind and the ism ( see analytical results by wilkin 1996 and simulations by e.g. comeron & kaper 1998 , blondin & koerwer 1998 ) .",

    "very strong emission of submm molecular lines can be explained if a temperature gradient is present in the envelope , e.g. because of dust formation at a certain radius .",
    "because of their spectacular eruptions , lbvs are the most well - known cases of massive stars with ejecta .",
    "it is not yet certain , however , at what stage ( bsg ?",
    "after a rsg phase or not ? ) this material is ejected , and how ( multiple events ? ) .",
    "lbvs are rare : in the list of clark et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , there are only 12 confirmed and 23 candidate lbvs .",
    "ir has played a key role in recent years .",
    "the search , through surveys like mipsgal , of round - shaped nebulae with luminous central stars resulted in the discovery of many new nebulae : 62 shells in wachter et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , 115 shells and bipolar nebulae in gvaramadze et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , 416 structures in mizuno et al .",
    "many of these nebulae are preferentially detected with spitzer 24@xmath0 m band , indicating relatively cold material .",
    "identifying shell - like structures is only the first step . to ascertain a clbv status ,",
    "the central object needs to be studied spectroscopically .",
    "this was done for many of these new detections ( c.f .",
    ", gvaramadze et al . 2010 ; wachter et al . 2010 ; stringfellow et al .",
    "2012a , b , and in preparation ) .",
    "the classification does not rely on the presence of a particular line , but rather on the morphological resemblance of the spectra to spectra of known lbvs - while not 100% perfect ( some peculiar o and wr stars display similar features ) , this method has the advantage of being simple and rather robust .",
    "a more definitive answer can be provided through photometric and/or spectroscopic monitorings .",
    "indeed , as their name indicate , lbvs should be _",
    "variable_. near - simultaneous photometric and spectroscopic monitoring in the optical ( and ir ) of about a dozen newly identified candidate lbvs has revealed that ws1 ( discovered by gvaramadze et al .",
    "2012 ) is indeed a bona fide lbv , presently displaying what appears to be s dor type variability as shown in fig .",
    "[ guy ] ( stringfellow et al . 2012 , in preparation ) .",
    "ir is also useful in revealing details of particular objects .",
    "for example , a herschel survey of lbvs undertaken at lige yielded as first result a characterization of the surroundings of wray 15 - 751 ( vamvatira - nakou et al . , submitted ) .",
    "ir photometry can only be explained if the star evolves at constant luminosity and dust grains are fe - rich .",
    "images also revealed the presence of a second shell , about 4 times larger than the previously known one , which most probably results from an older eruptive event . considering both structures , there is about 0.075 m@xmath11 of dust in the system .",
    "ionized gas is responsible for several forbidden lines observed in the herschel - pacs range ( fig .",
    "[ chloi ] ) , which allow a n / o abundance of about 7 times solar and a mass of ionized gas of 12 m@xmath11 ( 20 times that of dust ) , to be derived .",
    "dust can be well studied in the ir , so this range may provide clues on where dust come from in galaxies .",
    "two examples of such feedback were presented in the session : @xmath20car and sn1987a .",
    "the latter was observed with herschel at 100 - 500@xmath0 m wavelengths , and 0.4 - 0.7 m@xmath11 of dust was detected - mostly silicates and amorphous carbon ( matsuura et al .",
    "it is thought that this dust come from the explosion , but the role played by previous mass - loss episodes , in particular the lbv phase , is not yet clear .",
    "for example , about 0.12 m@xmath11 of dust was detected , thanks to 30@xmath0 m minitao observations , in the famous lbv @xmath20car .",
    "up to 80% of that dust belonged to the torus , hence may not be related to the big 1843 event .",
    "only a few percentage ( 4 - 6% ) of wolf - rayet stars displays surrounding nebulosities in the wise survey , and most are found around wn stars ( wachter , in prep ) .",
    "the morphological classification scheme of wr nebulae proposed by chu ( 1981 ) has been revised in this meeting by guerrero et al .",
    "( toal et al , in prep . ) using _ wise _ ir images and sdss or super cosmos sky survey h@xmath7 images for 35 nebulae associated with wrs .",
    "two _ wise _ bands were particularly used : the one at 12@xmath0 m , which encompasses pah lines and lines of low excitation ions , and that at 22@xmath0 m , to which thermal emission from dust and lines of he  i as well as high excitation ions contribute .",
    "three phases are defined . in the first one ,",
    "wr nebulae appear as complete shells or bubbles .",
    "it corresponds to the star just entering the wr stage , when its powerful wind sweeps up the previous slow and dense winds ( from e.g. lbv or rsg stages ) .",
    "the second phase is the clumpy phase . at that point ,",
    "the nebulae display knots of gas and dust connected by partial shells and arcs .",
    "it corresponds to an age of a few 10@xmath13yr , when instabilities break down the swept - up shell . the stellar motion through the ism has an impact on the morphology , for example one - sided arc may be sometimes seen .",
    "finally , the mixed nebular phase ends the cycle , with no definite morphology nor always a 1-to-1 correspondence between optical and ir images .",
    "it corresponds to the last stage , when the circumstellar nebula begins to dissolve into the ism .",
    "the close environment of massive stars is the `` missing link '' between the star itself and the large circumstellar features .",
    "it plays a key role in understanding the mass - loss , but it is also difficult to probe directly .",
    "emission lines arising in the wind and circumstellar material are a classical way to study this region , as well as near - ir excess linked to disk - like features . in this context ,",
    "be and b[e ] stars are targets of choice , and surprises are frequent .",
    "for example , graus et al . (",
    "2012 ) found three new sgb[e ] in the smc : they display typical spectra , with forbidden lines , but the line strengths as well as the ir excess appear reduced compared to usual objects of this class .",
    "it suggests that either the disks have less material or less dust than usual , or maybe that these stars are transitional objects .",
    "another case intriguingly shows the opposite situation : cd@xmath2149@xmath13441 displays forbidden lines and appreciable ir excess , but is a main - sequence be star away from any star - forming region ( lee and chen 2009 ) .",
    "a possibility may be that this star is in fact a weak b[e ] , rather than a classical be .",
    "the environment close to the star can also be studied , directly , by means of interferometry , which is usually performed at long wavelengths .",
    "most optical / ir interferometric measurements rely on the measurements of `` visibilities '' , which are directly linked to the size of the object .",
    "recently , several massive stars , including nine lbvs , were observed with the vlti ( groh et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "amongst these , hd316285 ( fig .",
    "[ groh ] ) : the recorded visibilities implied a size of 0.002  for the source of continuum radiation , and 0.004  for the source of the br@xmath22 line .",
    "a cmfgen fit to the spectrum yields a stellar model with which one can estimate the wind size in ir , and it agrees well with vlti observations .",
    "the asymetric shape of the measured differential phases ( red vs blue side ) favors a prolate shape for the rotating star wind , but it could also be explained by clumps or binarity . since",
    "the latter imply in time variability , a monitoring will be needed to ascertain the exact nature of the asymmetry .",
    "= 0.19 , rather than 0.25 as von zeipel predicted in 1924.,width=377 ]    while visibilities provide valuable data , `` real '' images are always more impressive .",
    "interferometric instruments such as michigan infrared combiner ( mirc ) and pionier are beginning to provide such data .",
    "mirc was the first to image altair ( monnier et al .",
    "2007 ) and several other rapidly rotating stars as shown in fig .",
    "it has also imaged circumstellar disks and multi - object systems .",
    "for example , the disk contribution of @xmath23sco was shown to remain stable during the periastron in 2011 ( che et al .",
    "2012 ) , and the mass - exchange in the @xmath24lyr system can be clearly imaged ( zhao et al .",
    "2008 ) , as well as the 3 components of algol ( baron et al . 2012 ) or the disk of the eclipsing companion of @xmath25aur ( kloppenborg et al . , 2010 ) .",
    "this session has demonstrated the usefulness of studies in the ir in studying the environment of massive stars .",
    "recent advances in this domain are notably provided by surveys , as they enable discovery of new objects to study , thereby improving the census of nebular features associated with hot stars .",
    "furthermore , ir diagnostics unveil the properties of these neighbouring nebulosities : morphology , temperature , composition , density are the necessary keys paving the way of a better understanding of the mass - loss in massive stars .",
