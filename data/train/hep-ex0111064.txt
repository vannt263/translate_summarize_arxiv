    "although , at present , the standard model ( sm ) provides a remarkably successful description of known phenomena , there are plenty of aspects that we do not understand yet and that may suggest the sm to be most likely a low energy effective theory of spin-1/2 matter fermions interacting via spin-1 gauge bosons  @xcite .",
    "an excellent candidate to a new theory , able to describe physics at arbitrarily high energies , is supersymmetry ( susy ) .",
    "susy is a large class of theoretical models based on the common assumption that there exist in nature a fermion - boson symmetry .",
    "a comprehensive susy search is almost impossible because of the large amount of truly independent parameters .",
    "the strategy is then to search for signals suggested by particular models in which theoretical assumptions are also adopted to reduce the number of free parameters to a few . in supersymmetry fermions can couple to a sfermion and a fermion , violating lepton and/or baryon number . to avoid this problem , a discrete multiplicative quantum number ,",
    "the @xmath3-parity was introduced  @xcite : @xmath4 .",
    "susy models can be constructed assuming either conservation or violation of this quantum number ( rpv ) .",
    "search for scalar top squark is particularly interesting as the strong yukawa coupling between top / stop and higgs fields give rise to potentially large mixing effects and mass splitting .",
    "such effects can lead the lightest top - squark mass eigenstate @xmath5 to be lighter than the other squarks : @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "when a set of susy parameters such as @xmath7 , @xmath8 and tan(@xmath9 )  @xcite is suitably tuned , light bottom squarks may also occur .",
    "+ both the cdf and d@xmath0o experiments have searched for direct stop quark pair production : @xmath10 with @xmath5 decaying into the following channels : @xmath11 , @xmath12  @xcite and @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "cdf has also searched for indirect stop quark production trough the top quark decay : @xmath14 with @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "searches for direct scalar bottom production @xmath16 with the sbottom decaying into : @xmath17 have been performed from both tevatron experiments  @xcite .",
    "an overview on such results can be found in  @xcite .",
    "cdf searched for a pair produced scalar top squark decaying via non - zero @xmath3-parity violating coupling @xmath18 to @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "the experimental signature of this process is two @xmath20 leptons and two @xmath21 quarks in the final state .",
    "events have been selected by requiring a lepton ( @xmath22 or @xmath8 ) from @xmath23 , a hadronically decaying tau lepton and two jets .",
    "the principal background processes are @xmath24 , @xmath25jets , @xmath26 , drell - yan and diboson events",
    ". we observed , combining both the muon @xmath27 and the electron channel @xmath28 , that no events passed the selection cuts .",
    "this is consistent with the expected sm background of @xmath29 events in the electron channel and @xmath30 in the muon channel . a 95% _ c.l .",
    "_ lower limit on the stop quark mass have been set : @xmath31 @xmath32 gev/@xmath33 , for a dominant @xmath18 coupling .",
    "the more recent and competitive result on the lower limit of the stop mass with this signature comes from aleph / lep experiment  @xcite .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) predicts five physical higgs bosons : a charged pair ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) , two cp - even scalars ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) and a cp - odd ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "cdf has searched for a neutral mssm higgs @xmath39 , where @xmath39 means @xmath40 or @xmath41 or @xmath7 , produced in association with @xmath42 : @xmath43 .",
    "the analysis is based on on @xmath44 pb@xmath45 of data corresponding to the run 1b multijet sample . with basic parameter choices for both the susy scale and the stop mixing",
    ", we obtained a 95% c.l . on the lower mass value for @xmath39 in a region of susy parameter space where : tan@xmath9 @xmath46 30 .",

    "the charged higgs particle ( @xmath47 ) may be observed through the following top quark decay : @xmath48 .",
    "this process is favored over the sm one : @xmath49 if m@xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 in two separate tan(@xmath9 ) regions : tan(@xmath9)@xmath51 @xmath53 and tan(@xmath9)@xmath46 @xmath54  @xcite .    3.74 in 2.5 in    both cdf and d@xmath0o searched for charged higgs . in particular the cdf direct search was performed requiring a high-@xmath55 central lepton ( @xmath56 @xmath53 , @xmath57 @xmath58 gev , @xmath59 @xmath22 or @xmath8 ) as well as a central @xmath20 lepton with @xmath60 @xmath61 gev , 2 jets and missing transverse energy ( @xmath62 ) with significance : @xmath63 gev@xmath64 .",

    "the analysis have been performed using @xmath67 pb@xmath45 of run i data . in the susy model under study",
    "the scalar top squark is not only the lightest squark but also the only one lighter than gluino and satisfy the condition : @xmath68 @xmath69 . therefore @xmath70 is the preferred decay channel and because of the majorana nature of gluinos they give rise to ls top quarks from @xmath71 decays . in order to search for such events cdf used the top dilepton events .",
    "the results of this search are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ff2 ] ( right ) ; no mass limits have been set due to the presence of three signal events and to the inability to probe gluino masses in the region close to the top mass , where the stop mass is forced to be unreasonably light .",
