    "the width @xmath71 for the different components of the gdr is dependent on the resonance energy @xmath72 and is generally used for all stable nuclei with @xmath74 80 @xmath75 where @xmath76 = 1.6 is taken from the one body dissipation model  @xcite .",
    "for the case of @xmath0au we assume that the average of the experimentally determined deformation parameters of the even - mass neighbor nuclei @xmath4pt and @xmath30hg  @xcite can be used to describe the shape of the odd nucleus @xmath0au , we insert @xmath77 and @xmath5 = 60@xmath34 into eq .",
    "( [ eq : gdr ] ) .",
    "the gdr centroid energy is @xmath68= 13.9 mev .",
    "these parameters are in accordance with the frdm and result in the following resonance energies and widths : @xmath78= 13.2 mev , @xmath79 = 3.1 mev and @xmath80= 15.2 mev , @xmath81 = 3.9 mev .",
    "the talys code was modified with these inputs for oblate deformation .",
    "the yield curve created using the cross sections resulting from modified inputs is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : yield - exptvstheory ] and is in better agreement to the elbe data .",
    "the photon strength function of @xmath0au derived from different theoretical models and compared to experimental data is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : strength - comparison ] .",
    "the strength function created using the modified inputs as discussed above is compared to the default models  @xcite in talys which treats @xmath0au as a spherical nucleus .",
    "it is clear that the new parameters lead to a reduced strength at energies below the gdr and thus result in a good fit to its shape with a constant spreading width .",
    "this agrees well to the experimental strength function given by bartholomew et al .",
    "@xcite for energies below the neutron emission threshold . above the separation energy ,",
    "the strength functions shown were deduced from the @xmath0au@xmath1 cross sections by veyssiere et al . the strength function derived using the modified parameters gives clearly a better fit to the data than calculations  @xcite on the basis of the quasi particle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) with phenomenological correction for deformation .",
    "for the @xmath0au@xmath1 reaction , the activation yield has been measured and compared to the hauser - feshbach model calculations as well as previous experimental data .",
    "the measured activation yield at elbe is in agreement to the calculated yields using cross sections measured with quasi - monoenergetic photons from positron annihilation in flight and laser - induced compton backscattering .",
    "the activation experiment discussed here , which was performed in combination with a direct determination of the electron energy via the bremsstrahlung spectrum endpoint , deliver precise photon strength data .",
    "thus they may allow a verification of data obtained previously by direct absorption experiments or by detecting neutrons from the @xmath1-process .",
    "they also allow us to make judgements on parameterizations developed for the prediction of the photon strength function as well as on particle transmission functions , i.e. on optical model parameters .",
    "we have demonstrated for the case of @xmath0au@xmath1 that a sum of two gdr - lorentzians with a small oblate deformation of @xmath0au determining the energy split and the width difference describes the photon absorption well .",
    "the availability of information on the nuclear shape as well as on the psf below threshold makes @xmath0au a prime case to perform a consistent test of statistical calculations of hauser - feshbach type and to derive a coherent picture of near - threshold processes .",
    "the detailed understanding of these has direct importance for the s - process as well , since the prediction of the relative abundances of the isotopes of hg depends on the relative strength of the @xmath62-decay of @xmath30au and @xmath30au@xmath82 in stellar plasmas .",
    "last , but not least , the experimental data reported here for the @xmath0au@xmath1 reaction may serve as a normalization for future measurements on other nuclei",
    ". the @xmath0au@xmath1 reaction has been used as a photoactivation standard for the experiments discussed in refs .",
    "we thank peter michel and the elbe team for providing a stable beam during activation experiments .",
    "we are indebted to e. haug for providing valuable information about the theory of bremsstrahlung and his model codes .",
    "special thanks to rudi apolle for simulating proton spectra of the deuteron breakup reaction under a realistic geometry . the technical assistance of andreas hartmann is gratefully acknowledged .",
