    "smith , morgan and bradt ( 1997 ) discovered coherent 523.92@xmath00.05 hz oscillations , which they interpreted as the neutron star spin frequency , during a type i x - ray burst in the low - mass x - ray binary ks 1731@xmath1260 , and found no qpos near 1 kilohertz , with upper limits on the amplitude of 1  %  rms .",

    "x - ray color - color diagrams ( cds ) were constructed from the 16 s data , and power spectra were calculated from the 62 @xmath9s   data using 16-s and 256-s data intervals .",
    "the power spectra were fitted using a power law ( the very low frequency noise [ vlfn ] , measured between 0.011 hz ) , lorentzians ( the qpos , if present ) , a broken power law ( the high frequency noise [ hfn ] , measure between 1100 hz ) , and a constant level ( the poisson noise ) .",
    "we found the qpos to be strongest at high energy ( this is in accordance with all previous results on khz qpos ) , and for that reason the 5.724.1 kev band provides the most significant detection .",

    "the results of the fits were corrected for background and differential dead time ( see van der klis 1989 ) .",

    "the 95 % confidence upper limit on the amplitude of a qpo near 900 hz with a fwhm of 15 hz is 3.1 % rms . during the second segment we find two qpos at frequencies of 898.3@xmath03.3 hz and 1158.6@xmath09.0 hz , and a fwhm and rms amplitude of 22@xmath08 hz and 5.3@xmath00.7 % , and 37@xmath021 hz and 5.2@xmath01.0 % , respectively . during the third and last segment we could only marginally detect the qpos at 899.8@xmath04.3 hz ( 1.7@xmath3 ) and 1182.9@xmath013.0 hz ( 2.6@xmath3 ) .",

    "there is a clear correlation between kilohertz qpo frequency and count rate , similar to what was observed in other burst sources .",

    "[ cd ] ) to study the dependence of the the kilohertz qpo properties on position of the source in the cd . from fig .",
    "[ cd ] it is clear that the kilohertz qpo properties are correlated with the position of the source in the color - color diagram . when the source is at the upper left part in the cd ( low soft colors , high hard colors ) two kilohertz qpos are visible in the power spectrum . when the soft color increases and the hard color decreases both qpos decrease in amplitude ( the lower frequency qpo becomes undetectable ) and the frequency of the higher frequency qpo increases .",
    "the overall count rate of the source also increases in this sense ( from upper left to lower right in the cd ) .",
    "c    due to the low signal - to - noise ratio in the individual energy channels the dependence of the rms amplitude of the kilohertz qpos on photon energy could not be determined in detail . in the energy range",
    "2.84.6 kev both qpos were not detectable , with rms amplitude upper limits of 3.4 % . in the energy range 4.68.2 kev",
    "the rms amplitude of the lower and higher frequency qpo were 4.0@xmath00.7 % and 3.9@xmath00.6 % , respectively . in the energy range 8.224.1 kev the lower frequency qpo was not detectable ( amplitude upper limit of 10 % rms ) ; the rms amplitude of the higher frequency qpo was 5.1@xmath01.1 % .",
    "the vlfn during the august 1 observation had a rms amplitude of 5.9@xmath00.6 % and a power law index of 1.61@xmath00.07 .",
    "the peaked hfn had a amplitude of 4.6@xmath00.4 % rms , a power law index of 0.8@xmath00.6 , and a cut - off frequency of 22@xmath013 hz . the vlfn during the august 31 observation had an rms amplitude of 7.1@xmath00.6 % , and a power law index of 1.51@xmath00.06 .",

    "the amplitudes of these qpos increase with increasing photon energy .",
    "both qpos are visible at the lowest count rates . at higher count rates the lower frequency qpo disappears , the amplitude of the higher frequency qpo decreases , and its frequency increases . at the highest count rates",
    "the higher frequency qpo is only marginally detected at 1207@xmath011 hz .",
    "if that qpo is real then its frequency is the highest so far observed in an x - ray binary .",
    "when the lower frequency qpo is detected its frequency is consistent with being constant .",
    "the minor differences in its frequency between slightly different data sets are within the statistical errors .",
    "when we combine all power spectra from the august 1 observation , the peak separation of the two qpos ( 276.1@xmath03.8 hz ) is not consistent with being equal to half the frequency of the 523.92@xmath00.05 hz oscillations found by smith et al .",
    "( 1997 ) in a type i burst .",
    "however , this inconsistency is artifical . in order to obtain a better signal - to - noise ratio we summed the power spectra of all three data segments obtained during this observation . during the first segment",
    "we see only the higher frequency qpo near 1176 hz , during the second segment we see both qpos near 898 and 1159 hz , and during the third segment only the higher frequency peak can be significantly detected near 1183 hz .",
    "combination of these three data segments gives rise to an artifical increase of the peak separation , due to the different focus in time of the two qpos .",
    "when both kilohertz qpos are present ( segment 2 ) the peak separation is 260.3@xmath09.6 hz , which is almost exactly half the oscillation frequency ( 261.96 ) during the type i burst .",
    "this result strongly supports models in which the neutron spin frequency is 261.96 hz ( 3.8 ms ) , the higher frequency qpo a preferred orbital frequency around the neutron star , and the lower frequency qpo the beat between these two .",
    "such a model , with the preferred orbital radius the magnetospheric radius , was already suggested for the three qpos found in 4u 1728@xmath134 ( strohmayer et al .",
    "miller , lamb & psaltis ( 1997 ) proposed a model where the preferred radius is the sonic radius .",
    "a problem for these models is the case of sco x-1 , in which the frequency difference is not constant ( van der klis et al .",
    "1997 ) as would be expected .",
    "the positive correlation between soft color and x - ray count rate and the negative correlation between hard and soft color ( fig .",
    "[ cd ] ) , the properties of the vlfn , and the decrease in the hfn strength with count rate taken together indicate that ks 1731@xmath1260 probably is an atoll source , which in our observations was in the lower banana branch , with the inferred accretion rate somewhat higher on august 31 than on august 1 .",
    "the large scatter in the cd may in part be due to background fluctuations .",
    "the 27 hz qpo is not uncommon in atoll sources ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ; strohmayer et al .",
    "1996 ) and seems to be closely related to the hfn ( `` peaked hfn '' ) .",
    "so , the properties of the kilohertz qpos in ks 1731@xmath1260 are consistent with what is known from observations of kilohertz qpos in other atoll sources .",
    "the qpos decrease in amplitude with mass accretion rate ( as inferred from the count rate , the 2 - 10 kev fluxes , and the position in the cd ) , and where we can measure it ( in the higher frequency qpo ) the frequency of the qpo increases with mass accretion rate .",
