    "inspired by compressive sensing ( cs )  @xcite , diverse compressive cameras  @xcite have been built .",
    "the single - pixel camera  @xcite , which implemented the compressive imaging in space , is an elegant architecture to prove the concept of cs .",
    "however , the hardware elements used in the single - pixel camera are more expensive than conventional ccd or cmos cameras , thus limit the applications of this new imaging regime .",
    "the lensless compressive camera ( @xmath0 ) , proposed in  @xcite , enjoys low - cost property and has demonstrated excellent results using advanced reconstruction algorithms  @xcite .",
    "though enjoying various advantages , the existing @xmath0  @xcite suffers from low capture rates .",
    "specifically , the currently used sensor can only capture the scene at around @xmath3hz . for a @xmath4 image ,",
    "if we desire a high resolution image , we need on the order of @xmath5 measurements ( relative to the pixel numbers ) .",
    "this requires about 1 minute with current aperture switching technique .",
    "this is far from our real time requirement as cameras are built to get instant images / videos .",
    "in order to obtain images in a shorter time , we have to sacrifice the spatial resolution , _",
    "i.e. _  providing a low - resolution image .",
    "an alternative solution is to increase the refresh rate of the aperture assembly ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ge ] ) .",
    "however , even we can achieve a higher refresh rate using an expensive hardware , the sensor needs a relative long time to integrate the light or a more expensive sensor is required .",
    "there are strong advantages with the , directly implementing compressive sensing .",
    "these include minimizing problems of lenses sensor .",
    "but with current approaches , speed is an issue . in this paper",
    ", we propose the block - wise to mitigate this problem .",
    "figure  [ fig : ge ] depicts the geometry of the proposed block - wise .",
    "it consists of three components as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : part ] : a ) the sensor board which contains multiple sensors and each one corresponding to one block , b ) the isolation chamber which prevents the light from other blocks , and c ) the aperture assembly which can be the same as that used in the  @xcite .    note that the block sizes can be different such that each block can reconstruct different resolution image fractions , thus leading to multi - scale compressive camera  @xcite .",
    "the pattern used for each block can also be different and can be adapted to the content of the image part , thus leading to adaptive compressive sensing  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we consider each block uses the same pattern as this will not only save the memory to store these patterns but also enables fast reconstruction for each block .",
    "+    this new block - wise enjoys the following advantages compared to the existing .    * since each block can be very small , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath6 pixels , we only need to capture a small number of measurements to achieve high resolution reconstruction",
    ". therefore the capture time can be short .",
    "* the coding patterns used in each block can be the same , therefore the sensing matrix is only of the block size .",
    "this saves the memory requirement of sensing matrix as well as speeds up the reconstruction .",
    "* patch based image reconstruction is fast and since real time stitching algorithms exist , we can perform real time reconstruction . *",
    "these blocks can be integrated to any desirable number , leading to extra high resolution images  @xcite while retaining the capture rate and fast reconstruction ; * the sensor layer can be very close to the aperture assembly , which leads to small size camera",
    ". in particular , the thickness of the camera will be extremely small  @xcite .      from the simple geometry shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ge ] , we can see that if the scene is far from the sensor , we will have significant overlapping regions .",
    "this will be discussed in next section . on the other hand ,",
    "the image stitching algorithms are usually based on the features within the overlapping areas to perform registration .",
    "since the angular resolution is limited by the distance between sensors and the aperture assembly , we can adapt this distance in different applications .",
    "+     +     +      in order to mitigate the problem mentioned in section  [ sec : overlap_far ] , _ i.e. _  the low angular resolution for far scenes , we propose the following * concentration - sensor regime * , where the sensors are put together in a  cellular \" shape .",
    "the aperture assembly can be a plane or a spherical surface as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : c_sensor1 ] . the planer aperture assembly in fig .",
    "[ fig : c_sensor1](a - b ) can be replaced by a spherical aperture as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : c_sensor1](c ) .",
    "the sensor layout of the spherical regime is detailed in fig .",
    "[ fig : c_sensor2 ] . in this configuration",
    ", the isolation chamber will be a ",
    "trumpet \" shape starting from the sensor to the aperture assembly , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : box ] . note the configuration in fig .",
    "[ fig : c_sensor1 ] ( c ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : c_sensor2 ] is a wide angle camera .",
    "we consider that the patterns used for each block are the same .",
    "the measurements can be expressed as @xmath7 where @xmath8 with @xmath9 denoting the dimension of the vectorized block ( with @xmath10 pixels ) and @xmath11 is the number of blocks used in the camera .",
    "@xmath12 with @xmath13 denotes the measurements and each column corresponds to one block ( measurements captured by one sensor ) , and @xmath14 signifies the measurement noise . @xmath15 is the sensing matrix , which can be random  @xcite or the hadamard matrix with random permutation  @xcite .      introducing a basis or ( block - based ) dictionary @xmath16 , equation ( [ eq : mea ] ) can be reformulated as @xmath17 where @xmath18 can be an orthonormal basis with @xmath19 or an over - complete dictionary  @xcite with @xmath20 .",
    "this dictionary can be pre - learned for fast inversion or learned _ in situ _",
    "@xmath21 is desired to be sparse so that various @xmath22-based algorithms can be used to solve the following problem  @xcite @xmath23 given @xmath24 and @xmath16 or variant problems  @xcite .",
    "diverse algorithms have been proposed to solve the above problem and we will use the advanced gaussian mixture model described below since it does not need any iteration as closed - form analytic solution exists .",
    "the gaussian mixture model ( gmm ) has recently been re - recognized as an efficient dictionary learning algorithm  @xcite .",
    "recall the image blocks @xmath25 extracted from the image . for @xmath26-th patch @xmath27",
    ", it is modeled by a gmm with @xmath28 gaussian components  @xcite : @xmath29 where @xmath30 represent the mean and covariance matrix of @xmath31-th gaussian , and @xmath32 denote the weights of these gaussian components , and @xmath33 .",
    "dropping the block index @xmath26 , in a linear model @xmath34 , @xmath35 , if @xmath36 in ( [ eq : xigmm ] ) , then @xmath37 has the following analytical form  @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 while ( [ eq_gmminv ] ) provides a posterior distribution for @xmath40 , we obtain the point estimate of @xmath41 via the posterior mean : @xmath42&= & \\sum_{k=1}^k \\tilde{\\pi}_k \\tilde{\\boldsymbol \\mu}_k.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is a closed - form solution .",
    "note that @xmath43 are pre - trained on other datasets and given @xmath44 , @xmath45 only needs to be computed once and saved .",
    "same techniques can be used for @xmath46 .",
    "the only computation left for each block is to calculate @xmath47 , which can be obtained very efficiently .",
    "most importantly , no iteration is required using the above gmm method , leading to _ real - time _",
    "reconstruction for each block .",
    "furthermore , each block can be reconstructed in parallel with gpu . since real time stitching algorithm exists ,",
    "after blocks are obtained via the gmm , we can get the entire image instantly .",
    "alternatively , we can pre - train a neural network for the inversion and obtain the reconstruction in real time  @xcite .",
    "( pixels ) block .",
    "10 trials were performed with different random binary coding patterns.,title=\"fig : \" ] +     pixels block.,title=\"fig : \" ] +",
    "in this section , we first conduct the simulation to verify the proposed approach and then describe the hardware prototypes we have built to demonstrate real data results .",
    "we consider each block with size @xmath6 pixels and reconstruct the images with different numbers of measurements .",
    "the image is of size @xmath48 .",
    "we assume that there is no overlapping among blocks and the image part is ideally captured by different sensors .",
    "the psnr ( peak - signal - to - noise - ratio ) of the reconstructed image is used as a metric and plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : psnr ] with exemplar reconstructed images shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : imge ] .",
    "the gmm is used for reconstruction .",
    "we can observe that even a single measurement in each block provides excellent reconstruction .",
    "the running time for reconstruction is @xmath49 seconds using an i7 cpu .",
    "+     +      we first used 4 sensors to build the block - wise to prove the concept , with photos shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : block_camera ] .",
    "we used @xmath50 pixels pattern for each sensor and these patterns are shared across these 4 sensors .",
    "the scene is a photo printed on a paper and pasted on a wall . without employing any stitching algorithm , one result",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : block_result2 ] , where the csr is defined as the number of measurements relative to pixels in the reconstructed image .",
    "it can be observed that good results can be obtained by only using @xmath5 of the pixel data ( csr = 0.1 ) , which is 102 measurements captured by each sensor .",
    "next we show the reconstruction results with 16 sensors ( a @xmath51 array ) in fig .  [",
    "fig : block_xy ] , where we restricted the light to test the performance of the camera in dark environment .",
    "it can be observed that even when csr@xmath52 ( as each block is of @xmath53 pixels , csr@xmath52 denotes each sensor only captured 12 measurements ) , we can still get reasonable results .",
    "we have proposed the block - wise lensless compressive camera to mitigate the speed issue existing in the current .",
    "multiple geometries of this block - wise @xmath0 have been developed .",
