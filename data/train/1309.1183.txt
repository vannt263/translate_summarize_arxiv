    "therefore , the lower gas mass fractions in groups with respect to clusters may simply be indicating that the fraction of baryons locked up in stars ( @xmath10 ; this includes stars in satellite galaxies as well as that in a diffuse intracluster component ) increases with decreasing total mass so as to compensate for the decrease in @xmath7 .",
    "the contribution of cold ( non - x - ray - emitting ) gas is generally thought to be negligible in comparison to the hot gas and stellar content of clusters .    alternatively ,",
    "if the stellar mass fraction does not rise significantly with decreasing mass , the implication is that galaxy groups are deficient in their baryon content with respect to clusters and to the universal mean .",
    "such a scenario is not without a physical basis - @xcite have shown that the inclusion of energetic agn feedback in cosmological simulations can indeed result in lower - than - universal baryon fractions for galaxy groups . indeed , by examining a large number of simulations with varying input physics ( the overwhelmingly large simulations ; @xcite ) , mccarthy et al",
    ".  concluded that _ only _ those simulations which include such ejective agn feedback are able to reproduce both the x - ray and optical properties of local galaxy groups and clusters .    while it appears that a general consensus has been reached on the ( hot ) gas mass fractions of clusters in the local universe , at least of relatively massive systems ,",
    "the same can not be said of the stellar mass fractions .",
    "the motivation for selecting this radius is two - fold : ( i ) for comparisons @xmath7 measurements made within this radius using x - ray observations , which are typically limited to @xmath5 ; and ( ii ) optical studies often use @xmath1 from x - ray observations as an estimate of the total system mass . ] .",
    "much recent observational work has been done on estimating the stellar mass fractions of groups and clusters yielding some apparently contradictory results . @xcite and lin & mohr ( 2004 ) ( hereafter collectively lm04 ) estimated the stellar and gas mass fractions for a sample of @xmath11 and @xmath12 x - ray - selected clusters , respectively , with _",
    "2mass _ k - band data .",
    "they found a weakly rising stellar mass fraction with decreasing total mass @xmath13 .",
    "the net result is a total baryon fraction that increases with total mass @xmath14 .",
    "similar results were obtained by @xcite , who examined stellar and hot gas content of 18 nearby , low - mass clusters selected from the 2df galaxy redshift survey and followed up with deep ground - based near - infrared ( k - band ) observations and _ chandra _ and _ xmm _ x - ray observations . @xcite stacked _",
    "rosat all sky survey _ data of over 4000 groups and clusters from the _ 2mass _ catalog and also found a rising baryon fraction with increasing mean system temperature ( which is a good proxy for total mass ) .",
    "@xcite measured the stellar mass fractions of 91 x - ray - selected groups in the _ cosmos _ 2 deg@xmath15 survey and found a steeper trend in stellar mass fraction ( @xmath16 ) than reported by lm04 . when combined with gas mass fractions from the literature , the net result is still a mildly rising baryon fraction with increasing total mass .",
    "more recently , however , @xcite ( hereafter a10 ) measured the stellar mass fractions of 52 groups and clusters in the sdss , finding an even steeper relation of @xmath17 and concluded that the overall baryon fraction is therefore approximately independent of total system mass , although it is offset in normalisation from the _ wmap _ universal baryon fraction by approximately 6 sigma .",
    "the origin of the differences in the findings of these studies is not obvious , but may be attributable to differences in the assumed the stellar mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath18 ) ( and its possible variation with cluster mass , due to the change in stellar populations with system mass ) , differences in techniques for estimating @xmath1 , as well as different sample selection criteria .",
    "it is worth noting that none of the above mentioned studies were able to directly take into account the contribution from diffuse intracluster light ( icl ) , due to its low surface brightness . whether or not this is a serious omission is a matter of some debate .",
    "for example , @xcite stacked sdss imaging data of approximately 700 clusters and found that , on average , the icl contributes only a small fraction of the total light ( @xmath19 per cent ) .",
    "in contrast , @xcite ( hereafter g07 ) used deep i - band data to study the icl of 23 local groups and clusters and found that , in some cases , it can actually contain the majority of the total light of the system , particularly for low - mass groups ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "g07 infer a very steep stellar mass fraction trend of @xmath20 and , when combined with @xmath7 measurements from the literature , conclude that the total baryon fraction is independent of total system mass , though it is offset from universal mean by several sigma .    more recently , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter l12 ) used multi - band cosmos data to infer the stellar mass fractions of a local sample of x - ray - selected groups and low - mass clusters . in a complementary approach",
    ", they also derived the trend over a much wider range in system masses using a statistical halo occupation distribution ( hod ) model which is determined from a joint fit to galaxy - galaxy weak lensing , galaxy clustering , and the stellar mass function all measured from cosmos data . as pointed out by l12 , the studies mentioned above inferred the total stellar mass by applying a simple stellar @xmath18 ratio conversion .",
    "l12 argue that applying a single conversion factor to all galaxies will bias the estimate of @xmath10 , since not all galaxies in groups and clusters are quiescent and furthermore the fraction of ` quenched ' galaxies is known to change systematically with total system mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "l12 find only a weak dependence of the stellar mass fraction on total system mass and a much lower amplitude than found previously by @xcite and g07 , which l12 attribute to the use of inaccurate @xmath18 estimates in these studies and/or because they assumed all galaxies were quiescent early - types .",
    "the implication of the l12 results is that the overall baryon fraction is a relatively steep function of total mass .",
    "note that l12 did not include the icl contribution in their stellar mass estimates . while they have argued that this is not the primary reason for the difference in their results from those of g07 , it is nevertheless possible that the icl could contribute a non - negligible fraction of the baryon budget of groups and clusters .",
    "the findings of l12 suggest that the differences in the way in which stellar masses are estimated may be significant and may explain the difference in the inferred relation between stellar mass fraction and system mass .",
    "we point out that not only are there differences in the way that the stellar masses are inferred , but there are also significant differences in the way the _ total _ system mass is inferred .",
    "for example , lm04 use a hydrostatic mass - x - ray temperature scaling relation to infer total mass , @xcite and l12 use a stacked x - ray luminosity - weak lensing mass relation , g07 use a hydrostatic mass - galaxy velocity dispersion relation , and a10 use the galaxy caustic method .",
    "these relations have not been directly compared against one another and it is entirely plausible that part of the reported differences are attributable to differences in the total mass estimates and are therefore meant to at least be measuring the same quantity . ] .",
    "note that the situation is complicated by the fact that the stellar masses are measured within an aperture that is determined by the estimated total mass ( e.g. , @xmath5 ) , rather than within a fixed physical aperture ( e.g. , 1 mpc ) .",
    "in the present study , we revisit the stellar mass fractions of groups and clusters but using a somewhat different approach .",
    "in particular , in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter b12 ) , we presented a new optically - selected catalog of 20171  high - mass groups and clusters with @xmath21 @xmath22 over the redshift range @xmath23 from the sdss . using a subsample of these groups and clusters with x - ray temperature measurements , b12 calibrated an optical richness - hydrostatic mass relation by employing the hydrostatic mass - temperature relation of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "an advantage of using x - ray temperatures rather than x - ray luminosity or velocity dispersion is the smaller scatter that temperature has with total mass .",
    "b12 argued that their richness - mass relation must be quite accurate on average , given the excellent agreement in normalisation between the number density profiles of satellite galaxies in the observed groups and clusters and those in semi - analytic models of galaxy formation ( see fig .",
    "10 of that study and accompanying text ) .",
    "below we confirm this accuracy by comparing the stacked line - of - sight velocity dispersion of observed and simulated groups and clusters , as well as making comparisons with stacked weak lensing observations of the maxbcg sample @xcite .",
    "we present two measures of the stellar mass fractions of our groups and clusters , both based on stacking in bins of @xmath1 . in the first method , we simply stack the sdss galaxy catalog and use a statistical background subtraction procedure .",
    "this method neglects the contribution from an icl component but does allow for the possibility of varying galaxy populations with system mass . in the second method , we stack sdss _ images _ and take advantage of the drift scan nature of the sdss to locally background subtract .",
    "this method implicitly includes the icl and all galaxies below the detection / inclusion threshold in the first method .",
    "thus , our work improves upon previous studies in a number of ways : i ) we have a much larger sample size ; ii ) we explicitly explore the importance of varying galaxy population and the contribution of the icl ; and iii ) we test our total mass estimates against models and stacked weak lensing observations .",
    "the present paper is outlined as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly discuss our group and cluster sample and test the accuracy of our total mass estimates , @xmath1 . in section 3",
    "we present our analysis methods for estimating the stellar masses of the groups and clusters .",
    "we present our main results in section 4 and make comparisons with previous work .",
    "finally , in section 5 we summarise and discuss our findings .    throughout this work",
    "we assume a @xmath24cdm cosmological model with @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "in this work we make use of the luminous red galaxy group and cluster sample described in b12 .",
    "the catalogue describes 20171  high - mass groups and clusters with @xmath21 @xmath22 within the redshift range @xmath28 , and each cluster is attributed a total mass estimate obtained using a calibration between the optical richness of bright galaxies ( @xmath29 ) within 1 mpc , and the x - ray derived mass for a small subset of 129  groups and clusters with x - ray measurements .",
    "specifically , in their eq .  3 ,",
    "b12 find    @xmath30    where the best - fit values are found to be @xmath31 and @xmath32 using the robust fitting algorithm of @xcite .",
    "the mass threshold of @xmath33 @xmath22 corresponds to a richness of @xmath19 .",
    "the catalogue is shown to be roughly 97 per cent pure and 90 per cent complete above this @xmath34 @xmath22 limit ( see b12 for more details ) .",
    "accurate total mass estimates are required not only because we want to know the total mass of the systems under consideration and to be able to measure stellar mass _ fractions _ , but also because the aperture within which the stellar mass is measured ( i.e. , @xmath5 ) is determined from the total mass .",
    "below we test the accuracy of our @xmath1 estimates by : ( i ) deriving stacked velocity dispersion measurements of our groups and clusters and making comparisons with stacked velocity dispersions of simulated groups and clusters extracted from the millennium simulation ; and ( ii ) comparing our derived total masses with stacked weak lensing - derived total masses for a large subset of groups and clusters in common between our sample and that of the maxbcg sample .",
    "for the stacked velocity dispersion test , we first query all spectroscopic galaxies within a projected @xmath5 for all clusters in our sample and then calculate the corresponding peculiar velocities relative to the lrg using the prescription described in @xcite .",
    "we then create a histogram of velocities by stacking all the cluster fields in a given bin , and fit a model to obtain estimates for the line of sight velocity dispersion , @xmath35 .",
    "the model includes a gaussian component for the contribution to the velocity dispersion due to the cluster , and a constant component for the contribution from interlopers .",
    "if our total masses are accurate , then we expect that our stacked velocity dispersions should agree with stacked velocity dispersions of groups and clusters of the same mass in ( n - body ) cosmological simulations .",
    "in particular , we select group / cluster halos with @xmath36 from the @xmath37 snapshot of the millennium simulation @xcite for analysis .",
    "we extract all central and satellite galaxies with stellar masses @xmath38 from the corresponding @xcite semi - analytic galaxy catalog that are within a projected radius of @xmath5 of the cluster that have a absolute physical velocity ( i.e. , peculiar velocity + hubble flow ) @xmath39 km / s with respect to the cluster center of mass velocity .",
    "the same cut is applied to the peculiar velocities of the observed cluster members .",
    "we estimate the velocity dispersion in precisely the same way as done for the observed groups and clusters ( i.e. , fitting a gaussian + constant model ) .",
    "we note that the derived velocity dispersions are quite insensitive to the stellar mass cut adopted for the simulated galaxies , but they are somewhat sensitive to the velocity cut imposed ( for both the simulations and the observations ) .",
    "however , so long as we adopt the same velocity cut for the simulated and observed galaxies the comparison is a fair one .",
    "importantly , the values of @xmath1 and @xmath5 used in our stacking analysis of the simulations correspond to their true values , while for the observed clusters the values of @xmath1 and @xmath5 are inferred from the observed richness within 1 mpc . by comparing the stacked velocity dispersions of the simulated clusters to the observed ones we are therefore testing the accuracy of our total mass estimates for the observed groups and clusters . if , for example , our observed total mass estimates are on average biased low , then we should expect to see a higher normalisation in the observed @xmath40 relation compared to the simulated one .",
    "a comparison of the velocity dispersions within @xmath5 for the simulations and observations is shown in fig .",
    "[ cap : mass_test ] ( left - panel ) .",
    "the solid red circles represent the stacked @xmath40 relation derived from the observed groups and clusters in our sample .",
    "the solid blue circles correspond to the stacked relation using simulated groups and clusters from the millennium simulation .",
    "the small black dots represent individual simulated groups and clusters .",
    "the dashed green curve represents the @xmath41 relation derived by @xcite , where @xmath42 is the 1d velocity dispersion of dark matter particles which are generally part of the main halo ( i.e. , not in substructures ) .",
    "note that we have converted the @xmath43 relation into a @xmath41 relation assuming a nfw profile and the mass - concentration relation of @xcite .",
    "encouragingly , the observed and simulated stacked relations agree to @xmath44 per cent accuracy in total mass at fixed @xmath35 .",
    "thus , our observed total mass estimates are quite accurate on average .",
    "interestingly , the amplitude and direction of the small offset is consistent with that expected from deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium due to turbulence and non - thermal pressure support in general in the intra - cluster medium ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    while the simulated stacked @xmath40 relation is encouragingly similar to the observed one , indicating a robustly determined average total mass , we note that the scatter in the @xmath40 relation of _ individual _ simulated clusters is very large ( @xmath45 per cent for haloes with @xmath46 ) .",
    "this should serve as a warning for studies with relatively small samples of clusters and that estimate total masses based on galaxy dynamics .",
    "we will touch upon this again in section 4 .",
    "we also compare the results to the @xmath41 relation found by @xcite and find remarkably good agreement ( compare the solid blue and red circles with the dashed green line ) , adding further confidence to the estimated total masses of our observed groups and clusters .",
    "a further independent check of our mass estimates can be made by comparing our clusters masses with estimates for those systems also found in the maxbcg sample @xcite .",
    "a calibration between @xmath1 and optical richness is provided by @xcite , who use stacked weak lensing to constrain the total mass in richness bins .",
    "we compare the maxbcg masses with our masses for a large overlapping subsample of @xmath47 systems in fig .",
    "[ cap : mass_test ] ( right - panel ) on a cluster - by - cluster basis , and find good agreement within the error bars across the entire range of total masses .",
    "the level of agreement is actually slightly better than expected since , as noted above , non - thermal pressure support is expected to bias x - ray hydrostatic masses within @xmath5 low by @xmath48 per cent .",
    "a possible reason for the slightly better - than - expected agreement is that weak lensing itself does not yield an unbiased mass measurement .",
    "indeed , both @xcite and @xcite have found using cosmological simulations that deviations at large radii in the mass profile of clusters from the nfw parametric form adopted in many weak lensing studies leads to a ( negative ) bias in the reconstructed mass at the level of @xmath49 per cent .",
    "in order to investigate how the stellar mass varies as a function of total mass in our sample , we stack the clusters in four mass bins ranging from @xmath34 to @xmath50 @xmath22 .",
    "the four bins have approximately equal width in log - space ( 13.7 - 14.0 , 14.0 - 14.4 , 14.4 - 14.7 , 14.7 - 15.0 ) and shown in b12 the scattering of clusters between mass bins ( due to errors in the recovered mass ) is minor ( see their fig .  6 ) .      for each cluster field",
    "we follow the prescription described in b12 and obtain all sdss photometric and astrometric data for galaxies by running the ` q3c ` radial query algorithm @xcite on a locally available sdss dr7 database .",
    "the galaxies are queried within a physical ( projected ) 5 mpc aperture and have the following properties :    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the extinction - corrected @xmath52-band model magnitude , @xmath53 is the photometric redshift of neighboring galaxies and @xmath54 is the corresponding photometric redshift error . for each galaxy",
    "we then calculate the k - corrected absolute magnitude ( relative to the redshift of the lrg ) using the prescription of @xcite , and retain only galaxies with @xmath29 to ensure completeness of the sample at all redshifts ( see @xcite ) .",
    "estimates of the background density of galaxies for each cluster are obtained by querying random fields at the same redshift of each system .    the stellar mass for each individual galaxy",
    "is then estimated using the colour - dependent mass - to - light prescription of @xcite :    @xmath55    where @xmath56 is the mass - to - light ratio in the sdss @xmath52-band , @xmath57 is a rest - frame colour , and the 0.1 factor is to convert from a ` diet - salpeter ' to a @xcite imf . for each total mass bin",
    "we then stack the fields to obtain an average stellar mass within an aperture of radius equal to the mean @xmath5 in each bin , and subtract a characteristic background density estimate ( i.e. , from stacking random fields ) .",
    "the simplicity of the @xcite prescription provides an attractive method for comparing our results with those of other authors in a self - consistent way .",
    "however , the method of fitting simple parametric galaxy evolution models to galaxy colours ( based on an earlier paper by @xcite ) , uses spiral galaxies in the model , and it is clear that our groups and clusters contain predominantly red galaxies ( see table [ tab : brightscols ] ) .",
    "therefore , we must test how accurately the @xcite prescription recovers the stellar masses of these red galaxies by comparing the mass estimates on a galaxy - by - galaxy basis .",
    "@xcite provide more accurate stellar mass estimates for @xmath58 galaxies from sdss dr2 by providing direct model fits to the @xmath59 and @xmath60 spectral absorption features .",
    "we can therefore test the accuracy of the @xcite prescription by calculating the corresponding stellar mass for the @xcite galaxies by using eqn .",
    "[ eq : bdjm2l ] .",
    "the comparison is shown in fig .",
    "[ cap : galmatch ] . splitting the @xcite galaxy sample into red and blue galaxies ( using the colour cut below in eqn .",
    "[ eq : redseq ] ) we find that on average the stellar mass of the red galaxies ( i.e. the major component in our groups ) is overestimated by @xmath610.1 dex .",
    "the opposite behaviour is observed for blue galaxies , whose stellar masses are underestimated by @xmath610.05 dex .",
    "these small corrections are applied when calculating the stellar mass fractions of groups and clusters in our cluster sample .          to correct for the missing flux corresponding to faint cluster member galaxies with @xmath63 , we require information about the cluster galaxy luminosity distribution and in particular , the faint - end slope of the distribution .",
    "we therefore produce a stacked background - subtracted luminosity distribution as a function of mass ( fig .",
    "[ cap : grouplfs ] ) , for all cluster members excluding the central lrg .",
    "we use only lower redshift groups with @xmath64 to ensure we are complete to a fainter magnitude limit ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "we find no significant change in the shape of the luminosity distribution with increasing cluster mass , and therefore we fit a @xcite function ( with arbitrary normalization ) of the following form to a single large mass bin :    @xmath66    with @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",
    "although this functional form does not fit the bright end well , the fit to intermediate and lower luminosity galaxies is quite good .",
    "we integrate the best - fit schechter function down to zero and find a missing flux percentage of 20 per cent ( i.e. , 20 per cent of the flux of the total flux obtained by integrating over all luminosities comes from galaxies finater than -20.5 ) .",
    "the missing flux percentage is found be insensitive to the integration lower limit , e.g. , the correction factor is found to differ by only 1 per cent if we adopt a lower luminosity cut off of -18.5 ( i.e. , the limit to which we are complete in fig .",
    "[ cap : grouplfs ] ) .",
    "the form of the luminosity distribution in fig .",
    "[ cap : grouplfs ] is comparable to many studies of groups and clusters in the literature .",
    "our value of @xmath69 is in excellent agreement with those obtained by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite in a variety of studies on sdss groups and nosocs clusters . although shallower , our faint - end slope is also consistent with that of @xcite who find @xmath70 .",
    "note , however , @xcite and @xcite find that @xmath71 is consistent with @xmath72 , and that the shape of the luminosity distribution changes with cluster richness .",
    "this discrepancy is plausibly explained by the that these authors obtained the stacked luminosity distribution within different apertures ( see argument by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .     in the group / cluster sample .",
    "the sample is split into bins of total mass and restricted to redshifts of @xmath64 to allow for probing of the faint end slope .",
    "the shape ( particularly that of the faint end slope ) does not change significantly with total mass .",
    "the best fit schechter function ( equation [ eq : schecfunc ] ) is overplotted as a black dashed line . ]",
    "we also calculate stellar masses by stacking the light in sdss images .",
    "this is independent of the galaxy stacking method described in section [ sub : photostack ] and has the added advantage of not requiring a correction for the missing flux ( section [ sub : missflux ] ) .",
    "this calculation will also implicitly include any icl component present in our clusters .",
    "the stacking prescription is summarised as follows , with a full description of the systematic effects to be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the key steps of the procedure are :    0.1 in    \\i ) * image retrieval .",

    "* all the sdss - iii images have their background subtracted .",
    "although sdss - iii sky subtraction algorithm was improved relative to sdss - i / ii and performs very well in general @xcite , when studying very extended structures such as icl or total light of the galaxy groups the sdss background estimates may be biased , because the sdss - iii sky determination algorithm uses the sky near the groups to build the global polynomial sky model across multiple fields .",
    "and although the sdss pipeline masks all the sources when constructing the global sky model , it is possible that the resulting sky is still overestimated due to the presence of the low surface brightness icl and undetected galaxy population in the group / cluster .",
    "therefore , instead of using global model of the background provided by sdss , we estimate the sky level at the location of the system based on the sky in the fields in the same stripe , but located far enough from the center of the system ( more than 15  or @xmath73 3mpc at z=0.2 ) .",

    "the sky - subtracted images from the previous step are rebinned to a fixed physical pixel size of @xmath61 1.3kpc ( which corresponds to the sdss pixel of 0.396 at redshift of 0.2 ) and large ( 7000x7000 pix@xmath15 ) mosaics centered on every lrg in our catalog are created .    0.1 in    \\iv ) * masking . * bright milky way stars in the images are obviously an undesirable contaminant , so we mask all the stars brighter than @xmath7421.5 by circular apertures of different sizes .",

    "the reason for masking only stars that are brighter than 21.5 is that near this threshold the star / galaxy separation algorithms of sdss start to break down @xcite , so we could artificially mask faint galaxies if we were to go fainter .",
    "additionally , we mask bright ucac @xcite stars and extended rc3 galaxies @xcite which are close enough to our fields , by cross - matching with those catalogs . and finally we use the sdss masks ( fpm files ) which identify certain defects such as satellite trails and defects arising because of bright stars to further clean up the images .",

    "the origin of this difference is not clear , but we point out that the x - ray hydrostatic mass formalism we adopt has been tested both against simulations and weak lensing observations with the general consensus that the masses are accurate to 10 - 15 per cent within @xmath5 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this is fully consistent with our findings in section 2.1 .",
    "we have used the enormous power of the sdss to perform a detailed statistical analysis of the stellar mass fractions in groups and clusters in the mass range @xmath139 @xmath22 at @xmath140 , with a much larger sample of systems than used previously . by stacking groups and clusters in bins of total mass",
    ", we are able to obtain strong constraints on how the _ average _ stellar mass fraction changes with total mass . the total mass estimates ( taken from an x - ray temperature derived mass and richness calibration from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are demonstrated to be accurate within @xmath8810 per cent on average using velocity dispersions and weak lensing .",
    "we provide two estimates of the stacked stellar mass in each mass bin by making use of the galaxy catalog data and images from sdss - iii , allowing us to quantify what is the ( maximum ) fraction of the stellar mass contributed by any diffuse intracluster light ( icl ) component .",
    "our main results may be summarised as follows :    * the stellar mass fraction ( including icl ) within @xmath5 is typically @xmath141 ( @xmath142 ) assuming a chabrier ( salpeter ) imf and depends only very weakly on total mass ( see the right panel of fig .",
    "[ cap : ourresult ] ) . *",
    "the contribution of the icl is significant , typically contributing @xmath143 per cent of the total stellar mass . *",
    "combining our results with gas mass fractions from the literature , we conclude that galaxy groups have baryon fractions that are well below the universal value .",
    "many previous studies have attempted to measure the stellar mass fraction in individual groups and clusters .",
    "the comparison of our results with other published works is an important part of this study and was a non - trivial exercise , as different studies adopted different methods of calculating the stellar mass from the luminosity , provide different corrections for missing flux below the magnitude limit , and do not always provide a correction to convert the projected stellar mass to a 3d stellar mass .",
    "the icl is also treated differently in different works ( it is generally ignored ) .",
    "we have compared with a range of published works and gone to great lengths to ensure a fair comparison .",
    "most of the differences in the reported measurements can be attributed to differences in the adopted stellar mass - to - light ratio and differences in the halo mass estimates .",
    "we are able to reconcile all of the previous observational results we have compared to in this way .",
    "the only exception to this is in the comparison to @xcite , who find significantly _ lower _ stellar mass fractions ( with or without icl ) in the most massive clusters compared to all other studies we have examined when a consistent stellar mass - to - light ratio is adopted .",
    "the origin of this difference remains unclear .    our main result , that the stellar mass fraction depends very weakly on total mass , jibes well with the predictions of both semi - analytic models of galaxy formation and full cosmological hydrodynamical simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "note that while there are ( sometimes large ) differences in the predicted normalisations of the @xmath144-@xmath1 relations from different models and simulations , to our knowledge they all consistently predict similarly flat shapes .",
    "this is not surprising - as discussed in detail in @xcite it is difficult to see physically how there could be a very steep relationship ( as claimed by both @xcite and @xcite ) , given that clusters are assembled ( by mass ) primarily from the accretion of groups ) , which is what is implied at face value by the results of @xcite and @xcite . in the limit where feedback is not energetic enough to eject baryons from groups or clusters ( and/or their high redshift progenitors ) , the total baryon fraction ought to be close to the universal mean , as simulations have consistently shown over the past two decades . in the limit where feedback _ is _ energetically sufficient to eject baryons",
    ", we expect the ejection to be more efficient in low - mass systems due to their lower binding energies , and thus the baryon fraction should increase with total mass .",
    "our observations strongly suggest that the latter scenario is closer to the truth ( see the right panel of fig .",
    "[ cap : ourresult ] ) . ] .    with regards to the normalisation of the @xmath10-@xmath1 relation ,",
    "there remain significant uncertainties due to our ignorance of the stellar mass - to - light ratio . in a given passband ,",
    "the stellar mass - to - light ratio depends on the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) , the age and metallicity ( distributions ) of the stellar population , and the dust absorption column along the line of sight .",
    "@xcite argue that non - imf systematic uncertainties can be as large as 45 per cent . adopting this estimate , then for a chabrier ( salpeter ) imf",
    ", we find @xmath145 ( @xmath146 ) for a typical mass of @xmath147 m@xmath148 .",
    "for a universal baryon fraction @xmath149 @xcite , this implies a ( weakly total mass - dependent ) star formation efficiency of @xmath150 ( @xmath151 ) in the case of a chabrier ( salpeter ) imf .",
    "thus , our results point to a relatively low star formation efficiency for groups and clusters . while our estimates are lower than some previous studies of groups and clusters , they are reassuringly consistent with the _ global _ star formation efficiency predicted by semi - analytic models that match the galaxy luminosity function ( e.g. , @xcite ) , as well as the predictions of the abundance matching technique ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in the future we plan to study the individual contributions of the satellite galaxies , the bcg , and icl to the total stellar mass .",
    "the relative proportions of these components , as well as their spatial distributions , ought to constrain the efficiency of tidal stripping and dynamical friction of infalling galaxies and offer a means for improving the prescriptions of these processes in semi - analytic models .",
