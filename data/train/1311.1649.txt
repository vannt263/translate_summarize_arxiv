    "the x - ray pulsar in the system has a short spin period ( seconds ) compared to those in wind - fed systems ( minutes ) , as the mass and angular - momentum accretion rate in rlof systems is much higher than in the latter . since its discovery ,",
    "observations with various x - ray telescopes show a steady spin - up of the ns .",
    "this makes an exceptional x - ray pulsar in which no spin - down episode has been observed @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that the magnetic moment in may be as low as that of the bursting pulsar , i.e. @xmath20 .",
    "recent analysis by @xcite and @xcite , like several earlier investigations , found a low value for the ns mass @xmath21 .",
    "both theories and statistical analyses suggest that the initial masses of nss might have a bimodal underlying distribution , probably originating from two different formation mechanisms : core collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) and electron - capture supernovae ( ecsne ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a ccsn occurs when a high - mass star develops a degenerate iron core that exceeds the chandrasekhar limit , while an ecsn is associated with the collapse of a lower - mass onemg core as it loses pressure support owing to the sudden capture of electrons by the mg and ne nuclei @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations indicate that ecsne are under - energetic compared to ccsne by at least an order of magnitude .",
    "however they are , at the same time , relatively fast , neutrino - driven , delayed explosions .",
    "the short time available for the propagation of the shock is expected to prevent a strong build - up of core asymmetries , leading to typical kicks of @xmath22 , lower than those in ccsn events @xcite .",
    "as ecsne should produce somewhat less massive nss ( @xmath23 ) than ccsne @xcite , the low mass of the ns in would be consistent with its formation by an ecsn in a degenerate onemg core , which is is expected to form at the end of the evolution of stars with masses of @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "thus , assuming an explosive mass loss during the formation of the ns of about @xmath25 and a few solar mass of stellar wind mass loss from the ns progenitor , @xcite concluded that a @xmath26 main - sequence progenitor system would be consistent with the present configuration of .",
    "the more massive star ( i.e. , the progenitor of the ns ) first evolves to fill its rl , triggering mass transfer to the less massive star . since the initial mass ratio is not extreme , the binary is unlikely to undergo common envelope ( ce ) evolution before the sn that cause its orbit to shrink rapidly ( for reviews of ce evolution , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , a potential problem with such a scenario is that quasi - conservation of mass and orbital angular momentum during the mass transfer would lead to a fairly wide pre - sn system , such that the present orbital period of @xmath27 days would be hard to understand , unless a large amount of orbital angular momentum has been lost with relatively small mass ( at most a few solar masses ) from the system . in this paper",
    ", we will try to search plausible evolutionary tracks for , taking into account various kinds of orbital angular momentum loss mechanisms .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the stellar evolution code and the angular momentum loss mechanisms used .",
    "we present the calculated results of the binary evolution in section 3 .",
    "discussion and conclusions are given in section 4 .",
    "we adopt an updated version of the stellar evolution code originally developed by @xcite to compute the binary evolution . the binary system is initially composed of two zero - age main - sequence ( zams ) stars with an orbital period @xmath28 .",
    "we set the more massive star as the primary ( of mass @xmath29 ) , which fills the rl first and is the progenitor of the ns , and the other one as the secondary ( of mass @xmath30 ) .",
    "low metallicities ( @xmath31 and 0.01 ) are taken for each star according to the environment of the smc @xcite .",
    "the effective radius @xmath32 of the rl for the primary star is calculated from the @xcite s equation , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the mass ratio of the binary components and @xmath35 is the orbital separation .",
    "the rate of mass transfer via rlof is calculated with @xmath36m_\\odot { \\rm yr^{-1}}$ ] in the code , where @xmath37 is the radius of the primary , and we adopt @xmath38 in the calculation .",
    "we assume that the primary star rotates synchronously with the binary orbital revolution , since the timescale of tidal synchronization is generally much shorter than the characteristic evolutionary timescale of the binaries considered here .",
    "we consider two kinds of mechanisms of angular momentum loss .",
    "the first is the angular momentum loss due to gravitational radiation .",
    "this becomes important when the orbital period is short .",
    "the rate of the angular momentum loss is given by @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 are the orbital angular momentum , gravitational constant , and speed of light , respectively .",
    "the second and more important angular momentum loss mechanism is nonconservative mass transfer . during the mass - transfer processes , part of the transferred mass from the primary star",
    "may escape the binary system , carrying away the orbital angular momentum @xcite .",
    "this mass loss might be related to the rapid rotation of the accreting star .",
    "since the accreting matter carries a certain angular momentum that will be transferred to the secondary @xcite , this angular momentum spins up the top layers of the secondary star , and is transferred further into the star due to rotationally induced mixing processes .",
    "when the secondary is spun up to close to critical rotation it starts losing mass due to the influence of centrifugal force ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although it is not clear in which ways the material leaves the binary .",
    "considering the complicated processes of mass loss , we adopt four kinds of mass loss as follows . in the first case",
    "we assume that a fraction @xmath43 of the transferred mass is ejected out of the binary as isotropic winds from the secondary , carrying away the specific angular momentum of the secondary , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the angular velocity of the binary .",
    "alternatively , the transferred mass might be lost at the inner lagrangian ( @xmath46 ) point and the corresponding rate of angular momentum loss is @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the fraction of mass loss , and @xmath49 is the distance from the @xmath46 point to the center of mass of the binary system .    in some cases , the matter surrounding the two components may expand to the outer lagrangian ( @xmath15 ) point , and part of the material lost from the donor star may escape the system through the @xmath15 point @xcite .",
    "assuming that a fraction @xmath50 of the matter flow leaves the binary , the angular momentum loss rate due to the @xmath15 point outflow is given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the distance between the mass center of binary and the @xmath15 point . in our calculation , we take into account the @xmath15 point outflow after the mass ratio inverts , to ensure that the outflows is on the side of the lower - mass star that fills the rl .",
    "the last case is the angular momentum loss due to a circumbinary ( cb ) disk .",
    "cb disks were first proposed by @xcite when investigating the evolution of x - ray binaries .",
    "recently , cb disks are considered in a wide variety of astrophysical objects , e.g. , young binary stars , protoplanetary systems , cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) and massive binary black hole systems in active galactic nuclei ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "it has been argued that during mass exchange in binary systems , some of the lost matter which possesses high orbital angular momentum may form a disk surrounding the binary system rather than leave the binary system @xcite . as shown by @xcite and @xcite , cb disks can efficiently extract orbit angular momentum from the binary , and enhance the mass transfer rates . in this work",
    ", we assume that a fraction @xmath53 of the mass lost from the donor feeds into the cb disk . at the inner edge @xmath54 of the disk tidal torques",
    "are then exerted on the binary via gravitational interaction , and the corresponding angular momentum loss rate is @xcite @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 @xcite , @xmath58 is the time since the onset of the cb disk formation , and @xmath59 is the viscous timescale at the inner edge of the cb disk . for the standard @xmath43-viscosity disk @xcite , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the scale height of the disk at the inner edge . in the following calculation we set the viscosity parameter @xmath62 , and assume that the disk is hydrostatically",
    "supported , and geometrically thin with @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "the formation of a hmxb like smc x-1 requires two initially massive stars .",
    "when it evolves to become a supergiant and fill its rl , the primary star transfers material to the secondary on a thermal timescale , and the binary orbit shrinks rapidly at first . because the mass ratio is not far from unity , the mass transfer process is dynamically stable without the occurrence of a ce . a large fraction of the transferred matter is expected to be accreted by the secondary star .",
    "when the mass ratio inverts , further mass transfer leads to increase of the orbital period .",
    "finally the primary star develops an onemg core , which collapses to be a ns . at this time the primary star is much less massive than the secondary .",
    "considering the fact that a small fraction of the binary mass is lost and a small kick is imparted to the newborn ns during the sn , the binary orbit should be nearly circular or mildly eccentric after the sn . during the subsequent evolution , since stellar winds of the main - sequence secondary",
    "is not strong , there is hardly any mass transfer until the secondary starts to fill its rl .",
    "so we expect that the masses of the ns and the optical companion has changed little since the sn , and will use them to constrain the binary parameters before the sn .",
    "it is noted that , after the onset of the secondary rlof , the large mass ratio between the companion star and the ns will cause the orbit to shrink in response to mass transfer , most likely leading to a ce event .",
    "when a star explodes as a sn , the ns formed receives a velocity kick due to any asymmetry in the explosion @xcite .",
    "this also imparts an impulse to the companion star resulting in an eccentric binary orbit .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the low mass of the ns in suggests that its formation is likely to be due to an electron - capture collapse with a low kick velocity , which results in a small eccentricity .",
    "tidal interaction between the ns and the companion star can also circularize the binary orbit if it is narrow enough .",
    "we first try to estimate the possible distributions of the orbital period before the sn and the eccentricity after the sn from current binary parameters .",
    "the ns mass ( @xmath64 ) , the secondary mass ( @xmath65 ) and the orbital period ( @xmath66 d ) have already been estimated from the observations of .",
    "the mass of the secondary is assumed to be constant during the sn , and the primary s mass before the sn can be constrained by the range of the helium core mass ( @xmath67 ) that leads to an ecsn @xcite .",
    "the sn is thought to take place in a circular orbit because of the previous mass transfer , and the kick direction is assumed to be uniform over all directions .",
    "we take the kick velocity @xmath68 from a maxwellian distribution @xmath69 where the velocity dispersion @xmath70 is usually taken to be @xmath71 @xcite or @xmath72 @xcite based on the analysis of various pulsar proper motion samples for ccsn events .",
    "the kick velocities must be much lower for ecsne ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a small kick value ( @xmath73 of the standard ns kick , i.e. , @xmath74 kms@xmath75 ) was adopted by @xcite , in order to estimate the overconcentration of ecsn sources in the smc bar .",
    "here we set @xmath76 , 50 , and 70 kms@xmath75 to examine the effect of ecsn kicks .",
    "figure 1 shows the derived distributions of the pre - sn orbital period ( top panel ) and the post - sn eccentricity ( middle panel ) for a @xmath77 pre - sn system , with the assumption that the post - sn period is @xmath78 days .",
    "the results with the ccsn kicks are also presented for comparison . with the increase of @xmath70 , a more extended range of the pre - sn orbital period can result in the 4 day post - sn period , and",
    "the post - sn eccentricity tends to be larger .",
    "for sufficiently large kicks the eccentricity can be larger than unity so that the binary is disrupted . for ccsne",
    "this occurs at the high - end in the distribution of the pre - sn period , providing an upper limit of @xmath79 days .",
    "this means that a @xmath80 day pre - sn binary would not evolve to a 4 day post - sn binary with the mass parameters . from the contours in the orbital period vs. eccentricity plane ( the bottom panel )",
    ", one can see the trend of pre - sn period and post - sn eccentricity distributions .",
    "there are two  wings \" with the center close to the post - sn period .",
    "the most probable regions vary from the center to the wings when @xmath81 is increasing . for ccsn kicks , to form the expected post - sn systems like requires a pre - sn period @xmath82 days , and the post - sn eccentricity is high ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "for ecsne a lower eccentricity is expected and a relatively longer pre - sn period ( @xmath84 ) is required .      following the above analysis",
    ", we simplify the formation of to be the evolution of a zams binary system to a pre - sn binary with the orbital period @xmath84 , the primary ( he star ) s mass @xmath85 , and the secondary s mass @xmath86 .",
    "we select two sets of mass parameters for the progenitor binary to illustrate the possible evolutionary tracks of .",
    "they are @xmath87 and @xmath88 zams binaries with similar initial total masses for the conservative evolution .",
    "we adjust the initial mass of the secondary if the evolutionary model is nonconservative , in order to keep the secondary mass at the sn within the suitable range .",
    "we first consider the evolution of the progenitor system with the initial primary s mass @xmath90 . to examine the possible evolutionary tracks and the influence of different angular momentum loss mechanisms ,",
    "we construct five models with various kinds of mass and angular momentum loss mentioned in section 2.2 : ( 1 ) conservative mass transfer ; ( 2 ) nonconservative mass transfer with mass loss from the secondary ; ( 3 ) nonconservative mass transfer with mass loss from the @xmath46 point ; ( 4 ) nonconservative mass transfer with mass loss from the @xmath15 point ; and ( 5 ) nonconservative mass transfer with a small fractional mass feeding into the cb disk .",
    "the initial orbit periods are taken to be @xmath91 , 2.0 , 2.5 , 3.0 , 3.5 , 4.0 , 5.0 , 7.0 , and 10.0 days . at the smallest orbital period",
    "the zero - age primary star just fits the size of the rl .",
    "the metallicities are adopted to be @xmath92 and 0.004 .",
    "the results of the pre - sn evolution for different initial orbital periods are summarized in tables 1 ( for models [ 1]-[4 ] ) , 2 , and 3 ( for model [ 5 ] ) . in the tables",
    "@xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 are the primary ( he star ) s mass , the secondary s mass and the orbital period close to the end of the primary s evolution , respectively . in table 1",
    "we distinguish cases a and b mass transfer , which occurs when the primary burns hydrogen in its core and evolves off the main - sequence but before helium core ignition , respectively .",
    "the case b mass transfer is most likely to be unstable if the value of @xmath50 is high for model ( 4 ) .",
    "this is what ",
    "divergent \" means in the tables .",
    "so we only present the results of model ( 2)-(4 ) with case a and stable case b mass transfer .",
    "the results of the first three models in table 1 show little distinction .",
    "the orbital angular momentum loss from the binaries is all inefficient , so that the final orbital periods are usually larger than 40 days ( for @xmath92 ) or 25 days ( for @xmath97 ) , inconsistent with those for .",
    "it is also noted that a larger @xmath98 leads to longer @xmath99 because of longer mass transfer time . for each model , the higher @xmath100 ,",
    "the heavier the evolved he star and the lighter the secondary .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath99 decreases with increasing @xmath100 for case a mass transfer , but increases with @xmath100 for case b mass transfer .",
    "this means the lowest pre - sn period @xmath99 corresponds to the @xmath100 around the boundary between case a and case b evolution .",
    "different from the first three models , in model ( 4 ) the mass loss from the @xmath15 point can cause secular orbital shrinking .",
    "if the mass loss fraction @xmath101 , @xmath99 becomes shorter than 10 days , which satisfies what is needed for the formation of .",
    "although the @xmath15 point outflow provides a way for the formation of relatively compact systems .",
    "this mechanism requires a considerable mass loss rate , and sometimes the primary s mass at the end of the evolution is lower than the range for an ecsn .",
    "thus in model ( 5 ) we take into account the influence of a cb disk formed during the mass transfer . in this case",
    "we adopt the progenitor binary system of @xmath102 with the secondary s mass slightly higher than that in model ( 1 ) , and we only calculate the evolution with @xmath100 near the the boundary between case a and case b mass transfer .",
    "similar as in model ( 4 ) , the case b mass transfer becomes unstable if @xmath53 is large , so we mainly focus on case a evolution .",
    "the results are presented in tables 2 and 3 with @xmath92 and @xmath97 , respectively .",
    "we can always find that it is able to form a pre - sn binary system with a relatively small @xmath53 ( a few hundredth ) , which meets the requirements .",
    "the wider the initial system , the higher @xmath53 needed .",
    "we then select some representative scenarios from the tables to demonstrate the detailed evolution of the binary .",
    "figure  2 shows the pre - sn evolutionary tracks of the primary of initial mass @xmath103 in the h - r diagram .",
    "the panels from top to bottom correspond to models ( 1)-(5 ) , respectively . in the left ,",
    "middle and right columns the initial orbital period @xmath100 is taken to be 2.0 , 2.5 , and 3.0 days , respectively . for model ( 1 ) , the initial secondary s mass is @xmath104 ; for models ( 2)-(4 ) , we adopt @xmath105 ; for model ( 5 ) , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 .",
    "the solid and dotted lines are obtained with @xmath108 and 0.004 , respectively . in fig .  3 , we compare the mass transfer rates between different models with different @xmath109 .",
    "the figure is organized same as fig .  2 .",
    "the only case b evolution is for @xmath110 days and @xmath111 , and in other scenarios are all case a evolutions .",
    "we can see that there are not any significant differences in the evolutionary tracks and in the mass transfer rates among the first three models with the same @xmath109 , while the other two models are distinct from the others .",
    "the binaries generally experience three ( or two , the first two phases are sometimes degenerated ) phases of mass transfer in case a evolution in fig .  3 .",
    "in the first phase the mass transfer proceeds on a thermal timescale ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for further discussions on thermally unstable mass transfer ) .",
    "the outcome in this situation is that the donor star overfills its rl even more , leading to further mass loss .",
    "although the star is driven out of thermal equilibrium during this phase , it manages to retain hydrostatic equilibrium and the system can in this case avoid a so - called delayed dynamical instability @xcite , which would have resulted in a ce stage .",
    "the second and third phases proceed on nuclear timescales determined by the core burning of the remaining hydrogen and , later on , the hydrogen shell burning , respectively .",
    "obviously the wider the initial system , the later the rlof mass transfer begins , because there is no effective angular momentum loss mechanism before the onset of mass transfer , and the mass transfer timescale becomes shorter .",
    "when @xmath109 is so long that there is case b mass transfer , the three phases merge into one .",
    "furthermore , lower metallicity causes later onset of rlof and shorter mass transfer time due to a larger initial stellar radius and ending the red giant stage earlier . for models ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) , if @xmath50 or @xmath53 is high enough , the mass transfer can be dynamically unstable , so that the binary enters the ce evolution when the orbital period is as low as @xmath112 days .    the orbital period evolution is shown in fig .  4 , which is also organized similar as fig .  2 , but in each subgraph we add the cases with different values of the mass loss fraction in different colored lines for comparison .",
    "the dashed horizontal lines indicate the possible range of the pre - sn periods expected to lead to the formation of .",
    "it is clearly seen that only in model ( 4 ) or ( 5 ) with suitable values of @xmath50 or @xmath53 can the binary evolve into the proper orbital period .      in this subsection",
    "we investigate the evolution of the possible progenitor of with a @xmath114 main - sequence primary .",
    "tables 4 , 5 and 6 present the results of the binary parameters for the primary evolving from zams to pre - sn in different models , similar as those for the @xmath103 primary . the orbital period evolution is shown in fig .  5 .",
    "compared with the case of @xmath90 , the higher mass ratio for @xmath115 leads to shorter @xmath99 for similar total mass , initial orbital period and metallicity .",
    "usually models ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) are more preferred , while in the case of conservative mass transfer , the @xmath99 sometimes nearly fits in the pre - sn period range for the formation of , but the he star mass exceeds the upper limit of the he core mass for an ecsn .    combining the calculated results of binary evolutions with different initial parameters",
    ", we can roughly constrain the mass of the ns progenitor in to be @xmath116 .",
    "since the pioneering work of @xcite the formation and evolution of hmxbs with ns components has been intensively studied @xcite .",
    "the generally accepted evolutionary picture is that , the originally more massive star becomes the less massive as a result of mass transfer or mass loss , leaving behind a system composed of an evolved core and a ms companion .",
    "the subsequent evolution of the core to the sn leads to the formation of a ns / massive star binary system . however , there are big uncertainties associated with the effects of mass and angular momentum loss on the evolution of these systems ( in the context of the mass transfer and ce evolution ) . detailed investigations on the formation of individual hmxbs are also lacking because it is difficult to constrain the initial binary parameters from current observations .",
    "the low mass of the ns in is suggestive of its formation through an ecsn , which provides useful information on the properties of the ns progenitor and the formation scenarios .",
    "ecsne are thought to occur in stars of mass @xmath117 .",
    "combining with the total mass of the current binary , this suggests that the initial masses of the primary and secondary stars are comparable so that ce evolution is not likely to occur , and the orbital evolution is mainly dominated by the mass transfer / loss processes and tidal interaction .",
    "if the mass transfer is conservative before the sn , the ratio between the final and initial orbital periods is @xmath118 this gives an orbital period at least tens of days when the sn occurs ( the orbit may shrink to some extent due to the wind from the primary ) , and in the further evolution it would be difficult for the orbital period to decrease to @xmath78 days by tidal torques within the lifetime of the secondary star .",
    "this point has already been notified by @xcite to explain why be / x - ray binaries are in wide ( @xmath119 days ) and eccentric orbits .",
    "for , as the orbital change during the post - sn evolution is limited , through numerical calculation of the change in the orbital period during the sn , we simplify the evolutional problem to evolving a progenitor zams binary system up to the pre - sn epoch , when it has developed an onemg core approximately fitting the range expected to lead to an ecsn , with the orbital period @xmath120 days , and the secondary mass @xmath121 . obviously these requirements rule out the conservative mass transfer scenario , and the key problem is to find an effective orbital angular loss mechanism with relatively small mass loss to cause secular orbital shrinking . according to our calculation",
    ", it could be either mass loss through the @xmath15 point or or a cb disk ( note that the formation of a cb disk might also originate from the outflow from the @xmath15 point ) .",
    "the difference is that , in the former case some of the material leaves the system carrying away the orbital angular momentum , while in the latter the lost mass accumulates in a disk surrounding the binary , draining the orbital angular momentum from the binary through tidal torques . because of the difference in the efficiency of angular momentum loss , the fraction of lost mass in the total transferred mass is significantly higher for the @xmath15 point outflow than for the cb disk .",
    "our calculated results indicate that the evolution with the @xmath15 point mass loss or a cb disk could lead to the formation of through case a mass transfer ( @xmath122 days ) with @xmath123 .",
    "although our analysis focuses on the formation of , the conclusion that mass transfer is likely to be associated with significant angular momentum loss may be a general feature in the evolution of various kinds of binaries ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "previous investigations emphasized the necessity of nonconservative mass transfer to account for the properties of the related binaries .",
    "however , the ways of mass loss and the corresponding efficiency of angular momentum loss have not been well constrained . in this work",
    "we show that the outflow from the @xmath15 point or a circumbinary disk is more preferred than mass loss from the accreting star or the @xmath46 point , at least for the formation of .",
    "similar suggestions can be found in the literature .",
    "for example , in order to address the observed lower mass limit ( @xmath124 ) for the be stars in be / x - ray binaries , @xcite proposed that there may be mass loss from the binary systems at the @xmath15 point when the primary star transfers mass to the secondary ( who s rotation will be accelerated such that it will become a be star ) .",
    "the escaped matter takes away about six times the specific angular momentum of the binary system , so that those with small initial mass ratios would undergo spiral - in and evolve towards a ce phase . in the other extreme of low - mass binaries , @xcite recently reconstructed the complete evolutionary path followed by cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , using the observed mass - radius relationship of the secondary stars .",
    "the best - fit revised model of cv evolution indicates that the angular momentum loss rate below the period gap is @xmath125 times the rate induced by gravitational radiation , suggesting the existence of some other angular momentum loss mechanisms .",
    "@xcite considered several kinds of consequential angular momentum loss mechanisms including isotropic wind from the accreting white dwarfs , outflows from the langrangian points , and the formation of a cb disk .",
    "they showed that neither isotropic wind from the white dwarf nor outflow from the @xmath46 point can explain the extra angular momentum loss rate , while outflow from the @xmath15 point or a cb disk can satisfy the extra angular momentum loss provided that @xmath126 of the transferred mass is lost from the binary , or @xmath127 of the transferred mass goes into the cb disk ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "these results are in general line with what we have obtained for .",
    "mass transfer critically affects the evolutionary paths of binaries . depending on whether it is stable or",
    "not , a binary may either survive the initial mass transfer phase to become a semi - detached system or end up merging completely .",
    "the stability of mass transfer depends sensitively on the angular momentum transport mechanisms . including the mass loss from the @xmath15 point ( or a cb disk ) can significantly destabilize the mass transfer processes , enhance the merging rate , and influence the birth rate of compact star binaries .",
    "obviously a thorough investigation on this subject is needed before it can be implemented into future population synthesis calculation .",

    "<S> our results show that the outflow from the outer langrangian point or a circumbinary disk formed during the mass transfer phase may be qualified for this purpose . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that these mechanisms may be popular in binary evolution and significantly affect the formation of compact star binaries . </S>"
