    "the bullet cluster ( 1e065756 ) provided a new kind of observational evidence for the existence of dark matter @xcite . since then it has been used to test the cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm itself by quantifying different aspects such as the expected displacement between the dominant dark matter and baryonic component in a @xmath13cdm universe @xcite , the substructure velocity required to produce such displacement @xcite and its abundance in large n - body cosmological simulations @xcite .",
    "it has also been used to constrain the dark matter particle self - interaction cross section and to explore possible extensions to the concordance cosmological model @xcite .    since then , other examples of bullet - like systems have been found ; macs j0025.4 - 1222 @xcite , abell 2744 @xcite , dlscl j0916.2 + 2951 @xcite , zwcl 1234.0 + 02916 @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite observed a dm - gas displacement of @xmath9and a dm - dm separation of @xmath14 in sl2s j08544 - 0121 , a low mass cluster system with a total mass @xmath15 found in the the strong lensing legacy survey ( sl2s ) sample @xcite .    using a sheth - mo - tormen mass function at @xmath16",
    ", one can estimate that systems around this mass are @xmath17 times more abundant than massive clusters in the mass range of the bullet cluster @xmath18@xcite .",
    "this should open up the possibility of finding bullet - like groups in large numbers to test @xmath13cdm .",
    "however , a larger abundance of small mass systems has to be weighted by the probability of being in a merger and presenting a large displacement between the dm and gaseous components .",
    "these two conditions ( merger rates , maximum possible displacement ) are a function of dm halo mass in @xmath13cdm cosmologies .",
    "a detailed statistical study to estimate the dm - gas displacements of bullets has been performed for clusters @xcite but not for lower mass systems .    in this letter",
    "we extend such study for systems in the group mass scale .",
    "we measure the abundance of dm systems with a multi - modal morphology ( large dm - dm displacements ) and estimate the amount of systems with a bullet - like configuration ( large dm - gas displacements ) . to this end",
    "we use a high resolution n - body cosmological simulation ( bolshoi ) that allows us to find multi - modal dark matter distributions in hosts with circular velocities larger than @xmath19(@xmath20 ) .",
    "this letter is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : simulation ] we present the simulation and the halo catalogs .",
    "we continue in section [ sec : setup ] with the geometry of the problem at hand and the measurement setup .",
    "next in section [ sec : results ] we present our results and observational perspectives to finally conclude in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we use the bolshoi run , a cosmological dm only simulation over a cubic volume of 250comoving on a side @xcite .",
    "the simulation uses the art code @xcite to follow the evolution of a dark matter density field from @xmath21 to @xmath16 sampled with @xmath22 particles .",
    "the cosmology used corresponds to the spatially flat concordance model with the following parameters : the density parameter for matter ( dark matter and baryons ) @xmath23 , the density parameter for baryonic matter @xmath24 , the density parameter for dark energy @xmath25 , the hubble parameter @xmath26 , the slope of the primordial power spectrum @xmath27 and the amplitude of mass density fluctuations ( at redshift z@xmath280 ) @xmath29 .",
    "these cosmological parameters are consistent with the nine - year wilikinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) results @xcite .",
    "a detailed presentation of the simulation can be found in @xcite .",
    "this results in a mass resolution of @xmath30 m@xmath31h@xmath32 for each computational particle .",
    "the completeness limit in this simulation is set for halos with @xmath33 particles corresponding to a mass of @xmath34  or a maximum circular velocity @xmath35 of @xmath36 .",
    "we use dm halo catalogs constructed using the bound density maxima ( bdm ) algorithm @xcite . to define the radius of a halo we use a density threshold of 360 times the mean density of the universe",
    ". an important feature of bdm is that it allows us to detect sub - halos inside larger virialized structures .",
    "all the raw data used in this letter are available through the multidark database @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in order to facilitate the reproducibility and reuse of our results we have made available all the data and the source code available in a public repository .    to construct our main halo sample we follow three steps .",
    "firstly , we select all the host halos ( i.e. halos that are not inside a larger halo ) with circular velocities @xmath37(@xmath38 ) . secondly , we select the sub - halos with circular velocities @xmath39(@xmath40 ) .",
    "thirdly , we associate each host halo to its most massive sub - halo .",
    "each one of the pairs ( host & sub - halo ) is considered as a potential bullet - like system and is kept for the analysis described in the next section by using the sub - halos as the tracer of the sub - dominant dark matter clump in the merging cluster , i.e. the bullets .",
    "finally , we split the sample into two populations ; groups , with @xmath41 ; and clusters , with @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "these two samples are constructed at four redshifts : @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the number of pairs at each redshift in each population is listed on the first row of table [ table : numbers ] .",
    "bullet - like configurations have two dominant dark matter structures : the host halo and the dominant sub - halo .",
    "we describe the kinematics of this configuration by the position and velocity vectors of the sub - halo in a frame of reference where the main halo is at rest ; thus @xmath46 and @xmath47 , where the subscripts @xmath48 and @xmath49 refer to the host and sub - halo , respectively .",
    "the positions @xmath50 correspond to the minimum of potential and the velocities @xmath51 are the center of mass velocities .    the angle between these two vectors can be quantified by , @xmath52 this encodes information about the collision , i.e. cases of @xmath53 can be considered as head - on collisions while @xmath54 describes a grazing trajectory .",
    "the geometrical configuration can be further described by the the circular velocity of each component and the size of the host halo @xmath55 .",
    "another useful quantity computed in the simulation is the distance between the minimum of potential for the host halo and its center of mass ( computed from all the particles inside the @xmath55 ) , @xmath56 , which serves as a measurement of how much the host halo is perturbed .    in this letter",
    "we work with two quantities that could be inferred from observations of bullet - like systems .",
    "the projected distance between two dominant dm clumps , @xmath57 , and the projected distance between the dm and the gas clumps , @xmath58 .",
    "the projection is computed along the @xmath59-axis for all halos at all redshifts .    from the simulation point of view , the first quantity can be translated into the 2d projected values of @xmath60 and its value relative to the virial radius @xmath61 . the second quantity , the projected dm - gas distance , is not directly available from a dm - only simulation but can be estimated from the data .",
    "we also use the physical quantities described above to discriminate three main stages in a bullet - like encounter with @xmath62 .",
    "first , when the sub - halo crosses the virial radius of the host halo starting a head on collision , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "second , as the sub - halo crosses for the first time the center of the host halo @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "third , as the sub - halo reaches apogee and comes back to the center of the halo @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "figure [ fig : displacement ] presents the integrated probability distribution for the dm - dm displacements , @xmath57 .",
    "the left panel shows the displacement in physical units and the right panel as a fraction of the virial radius of the host halo .",
    "the panel with the projected 2d physical displacements also shows a vertical stripe with the estimated displacement for the bullet group reported by @xcite .",
    "in the group sample we see that a fraction of @xmath69 to @xmath70 should present a displacement equal than the estimate for sl2s j08544 - 0121 ; in the cluster sample this fraction increases to @xmath71-@xmath72 .",
    "the uncertainties in this estimates are derived from the uncertainties in the displacement measurement for sl2s j08544 - 0121 .",
    "this fraction is naturally higher in more massive systems because they are larger in size .",
    "normalizing the displacements by the virial radius , right panel figure [ fig : displacement ] , we see that the distributions are similar for the two samples at all redshifts .",
    "figure [ fig : geometry ] presents the geometry of the interactions using the variables @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the first evident feature is that most of the configurations have head - on encounters , @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) , while only a minority with @xmath77 can be described as having grazing trajectories .    for pairs on radial trajectories",
    "there are three regions of interest in this plane that correspond to the three merging stages described at the end of section [ sec : geometry ] assuming that the sub - halo merges ( or falls below the bdm detection threshold ) right at its second pass through the center of the host halo @xcite .",
    "these regions are shown as three different rectangles in figure [ fig : geometry ] .",
    "the first region ( continuous rectangle ) has @xmath78 and @xmath79 , which locates the systems where a head - on collision has just started .",
    "the second region ( dashed rectangle ) has @xmath80 and @xmath81 ; at this stage the collision continues after the first crossing of the host s center .",
    "the low number of halos with radial infalling velocities and displacements @xmath82 suggests that this the maximum range of radii for the apogee .",
    "the third region ( dot - dashed rectangle ) corresponds to @xmath78 and @xmath81 that is the the secondary infall after apogee .    in the next subsection we use the information in this collision sequence to estimate the expected dm - gas displacement .",
    "the results we have derived so far apply to multi - modal systems and their expected separation between the two dominant dark matter clumps .",
    "however , a non - zero dm - dm displacement does not imply a non - zero dm - gas displacement .",
    "we now estimate these displacements from the available information in our dm only simulation .",
    "our estimates are based on the different kinds of trajectories and collision stages described in previous sections . to start with",
    ", we consider that systems with @xmath77 describing grazing trajectories have a dm - gas displacement equal to zero . in systems with head - on collisions ,",
    "@xmath75 the systems with @xmath78 and large displacements @xmath83 most probably describe the beginning of the interaction and should have dm - gas displacements equal to zero as well . in all other cases",
    "the dm - gas displacement should be different from zero with the approximated value @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the offset computed between the minimum of potential and the center of mass for each host halo computed from all the matter inside the virial radius .",
    "this simplified model does not take into account that there is a fraction of halos with @xmath78 and @xmath81 for which the collision has not started and should have @xmath86 .",
    "a detailed modeling of this fraction requires the study of the complete merging history of the halo and sub - halo , a study beyond the scope of this letter .",
    "instead we caution the reader that the derived fraction of halos with a displacement @xmath87 must be considered as an upper limit .",
    "the results for the integrated distributions for @xmath58 are shown in figure [ fig : baryonic_displacements ] .",
    "the dashed lines represented the results for groups and the continuous lines correspond to clusters . as a test of our model",
    "we compare the cluster results against the analytic fit provided by @xcite .",
    "this fit reproduces the statistics for the dm - baryon separation found for clusters more massive than @xmath88  in a simulation which included a description for dm and gas with @xmath89 times more volume and @xmath89 times less mass resolution than the bolshoi simulation .",
    "the fit is valid for separations larger than @xmath90 , beyond which we find that it provides a remarkably good description within a factor of @xmath91 of our results .",
    "this gives us confidence in our approach to correctly estimate the expected fraction of groups with a dm - gas displacement .",
    "finally , from figure [ fig : baryonic_displacements ] we see that only a fraction of @xmath92 to @xmath93 of the groups are expected to have a dm - gas displacement equal or larger than @xmath9as observed in sl2s j08544 - 0121 .",
    "this fraction rises to @xmath94 to @xmath95 in the case of clusters , consistent with the results reported by @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite presented an analysis of @xmath96 galaxy groups in the sl2s sample . from the light distribution , only @xmath97 objects ( @xmath98 )",
    "have regular isophotes , @xmath99 had elongated isophotes ( hints of merging system ) , and @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) had a clear bi - modal light distribution ; sl2s j08544 - 0121  is one of these @xmath100 systems .",
    "the bi - modal objects are defined to have at least a clear second luminosity peak within @xmath102from the main halo , as traced by the strong lensing system .",
    "the lowest separation in those systems is @xmath103 and the average is @xmath104 .",
    "we now make a comparison of these fractions against the results of our simulations .",
    "the results are summarized in table [ table : numbers ] .",
    "the first row indicates the total number of halos in each sample at each redshift .",
    "the second row shows the number of objects with dm - dm displacements @xmath105 .",
    "the last row indicates the number of objects in the previous sub - sample with dm - gas displacements @xmath106 .",
    "considering that the statistics for the cluster sample are dominated by objects in the mass range of the sl2s j08544 - 0121  we make a comparison against this sample .",
    "table [ table : numbers ] shows that @xmath107 of the clusters are expected to have large dm - dm displacements , which is a factor of @xmath91 larger than the observational estimate by @xcite . however , roughly @xmath108 of these systems present a displacement equal or larger than the observed in the sl2s j08544 - 0121 , a fraction that is compatible with the @xmath109 fraction in the sl2s sample from which sl2s j08544 - 0121  was drawn .",
    "this rough comparison shows that our estimates for the relative number of bullet systems ( large dm - gas displacements ) with respect to multi - modal systems ( large dm - dm displacements ) is compatible with observations .",
    "a proper comparison must take into account all the observational uncertainties , biases and mixes between our two populations ( groups & clusters at different redshifts ) to derive a stronger bound from the simulation , something that is beyond the scope of this letter .    nevertheless , comparing the absolute number of systems with characteristics similar to sl2s j08544 - 0121  in the group sample ( last row of table [ table : numbers ] ) we predict that its number density is @xmath11 mpc@xmath12 , three times larger than the expected number density of sl2s j08544 - 0121  systems in the cluster sample .        [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this letter we estimated the fraction of galaxy groups and clusters in a @xmath13cdm cosmology that could present observational features associated to a bullet - like event .",
    "this is motivated by the recent observational results of @xcite where a system ( sl2s j08544 - 0121 ) on the mass range @xmath110  and velocity dispersion @xmath111was reported to feature a displacement between its baryonic ( gas ) and dark matter components .",
    "we computed the distribution of projected displacements between the dominant dm clumps in two kinds of systems ; groups with circular velocities @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ) and clusters with @xmath114(@xmath115 ) .",
    "we reported these results at four different redshifts @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "our results are based on large dm - only n - body cosmological simulation with a resolution that allows us to study for the first time bullet - like configurations in the mass range of galaxy groups .",
    "our main result is that a fraction of @xmath69-@xmath70 of the halos in the group sample presents dm - dm displacement equal or larger than the observed displacement for sl2s j08544 - 0121 . for halos in the cluster sample",
    "this fraction increases to @xmath70-@xmath72 .",
    "we also derived an estimate for the dm - baryon displacement . in the group sample @xmath92-@xmath8 of the halos",
    "show a displacement equal or larger than the measurements of sl2s j08544 - 0121  by @xcite ; in the cluster sample this fraction rises to @xmath94-@xmath95 .    for the case of sl2s j08544 - 0121",
    "a fair comparison is achieved against our cluster sample which has statistics dominated by objects of similar mass . in a rough comparison using the observational criteria @xcite we find that the relative number of bullet - like systems ( large dm - gas displacement ) with respect to a general sample of multi - modal systems ( large dm - dm displacements ) is consistent with observations ; both are in the range @xmath108 .    using the same criteria we find that in the simulation there are @xmath11 mpc@xmath12 groups similar to sl2s j08544 - 0121 .",
    "this number density is three times larger than the computed value for clusters .",
    "this opens up a new observational possibility with surveys such as sl2s that target a large number of groups and estimate its multi - modal nature from lensing analysis @xcite .",
    "an approach that can be further exploited with upcoming lensing surveys ( e.g. with he _",
    "euclid _ satellite ) and pushes for x - ray surveys with higher sensibility : chances are larger to find bullets in systems with lower x - ray luminosities .",
