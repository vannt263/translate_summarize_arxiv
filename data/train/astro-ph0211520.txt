    "what most distinguishes er uma stars from other su uma - type dwarf novae ( hereafter we call them ordinary su uma stars ) is the shortness ( 1950 d ) of their supercycles ( the interval between successive superoutbursts ) .",

    "the observations were performed between 1995 january 26 ( the next night of the superoutburst maximum ) and february 10 , using a ccd camera ( thomson th  7882 , 576 @xmath5 384 pixels , on - chip 2 @xmath5 2 binning adopted ) attached to the cassegrain focus of the 60 cm reflector ( focal length = 4.8 m ) at ouda station , kyoto university @xcite .",
    "an interference filter was used which had been designed to reproduce the johnson @xmath6 band .",
    "the frames were analyzed as in the same manner described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the differential magnitudes were measured against gsc 3439.1211 , which was commonly used in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "we determined the maximum times of the prominent maxima from a light curve by eye .",
    "the averaged times of a few points close to the maximum were used as representatives of the maximum times .",
    "the errors of the maximum times were usually less than @xmath0 0.003 d. we did not use a cross - correlation method to obtain individual maxima because of the variable superhump profiles . the resultant superhump maxima are given in table [ tab : shmax ] .",
    "the values are given to 0.0001 d in order to avoid any loss of significant digits in a later analysis .",

    "were determined against the following linear fit to all the maxima .",
    "figure [ fig : oc1 ] clearly shows that there is a striking @xmath8 ( corresponding to @xmath00.5 phase ) jump between @xmath1 = 43 and @xmath1 = 58 .",
    "this complete phase reversal clearly indicates that the humps before @xmath1 = 43 and those after @xmath1 = 58 are essentially different in nature .",
    "@xmath9    ( 80mm,50mm)fig1.eps    as is well known , there is a superhump - type phenomenon showing a @xmath00.5 phase jump during the very late stage of , or shortly after a superoutburst .",
    "this phenomenon is called late superhumps ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . by allowing a 0.5 phase jump ( or phase reversal ) between @xmath1 = 43 and @xmath1",
    "= 58 , the @xmath8 variation ( @xmath4 in table [ tab : shmax ] ) becomes continuous ( figure [ fig : oc2 ] ) .",
    "the linear fit is represented by the following formula .    @xmath10    where @xmath11 for @xmath1243 and @xmath13 for @xmath1458 .",
    "( 80mm,50mm)fig2.eps    these results indicate that the humps with @xmath1458 can be best interpreted as late superhumps ( we phenomenologically use this terminology purely based on the phase jump ) .",
    "in contrast to the usual evolution of superhumps in su uma - type dwarf novae ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , ordinary superhumps in er uma last only for a short time just following the superoutburst maximum and late superhumps predominate during the most period of the superoutburst plateau .    in order to show this transition",
    "more clearly , we first determined the _ true _ superhump period using the maximum times with @xmath1243 .",
    "the observed maximum times can be well expressed by a linear ephemeris ( equation [ equ : sh ] ) .",
    "a parabolic fit only yielded a negligible quadratic term of 1.4@xmath154.0 10@xmath16 d cycle@xmath17 ( for a comparison , a fit to @xmath1458 yields @xmath22.3@xmath150.5 10@xmath16 d cycle@xmath17 ) . a pdm analysis @xcite of the corresponding light curve yielded a period of 0.065582(56 ) d ( figure [ fig : pdm ] ) .",
    "we thus adopted @xmath7 = 0.06556(2 ) d. figure [ fig : fold ] shows nightly averaged hump profiles folded by this @xmath7 .",
    "ordinary superhumps ( around phase@xmath00 ) prominently appeared only on the first four nights ( until @xmath18 = 5 d since the start of the superoutburst ) .",
    "after then , late superhumps ( phase around @xmath00.5 ) appeared , and the late superhumps were the predominant signal during the most part of the superoutburst plateau .",

    "since such an early interchange between ordinary superhumps and late superhumps is quite unexpected in any known su uma - type dwarf novae , we first inspected the time - evolution of the superhumps during other superoutbursts of er uma .",
    "figure [ fig : fold2 ] shows the time evolution of the humps during the 1994 december superoutburst ( the data are from @xcite ) .",
    "the time - evolution of the hump profiles followed the same course as in the 1995 january  february superoutburst . although the earliest stage of the superoutburst was not observed , the 1994 january superoutburst @xcite followed the same course after @xmath18 = 7 d. thus , what had been believed to be ( ordinary ) superhumps during the superoutburst plateau of er uma were actually late superhumps . what were observed as a rapidly decaying giant superhumps at the very early stage of a superoutburst @xcite were ordinary superhumps .",
    "these independent observations confirmed that the evolution of the superhumps seen during the 1995 january  february superoutburst is a feature common to different superoutbursts .",
    "late superhumps in ordinary su uma stars usually appear late in their superoutbursts .",
    "this is consistent with the widely believed interpretation that late superhumps originate from a region close to the stream - impact point ( hot spot ) , whose luminosity periodically varies due to a varying release of the potential energy on an eccentric disk ( @xcite ) .",
    "a significant contribution to the light variation from the hot spot requires a condition that the luminosity of the accretion disk is comparable to that of the hot spot .",
    "generally observed `` late '' appearance of late superhumps in ordinary su uma stars is consistent with this picture in that the late superhumps become predominant only when the luminosity of the accretion disk drastically decays during the late stage of a superoutburst .",
    "however , such a condition is difficult to meet during the fully outbursting state , in which the release of the potential energy in the disk is 10@xmath0100 times larger than that at the hot spot ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the ( phenomenological ) late superhumps in er uma should therefore have a different physical origin than in ordinary su uma stars , unless the energy release at the hot spot is dramatically enhanced . from a viewpoint of the disk - instability model @xcite , a long duration of a superoutburst",
    "is maintained by a snow - plowing effect caused by the tidal instability .",
    "since it is widely believed that the ordinary superhumps are the manifestation of the increased tidal dissipation , a co - existence of a long - lasting plateau phase and an early decay of the ordinary superhumps looks like a contradiction .",
    "we consider that the increased tidal dissipation continues even after the initial ( @xmath205 d ) phase , and the location of the strongest tidal dissipation moves to the opposite direction ( observed as a phase reversal ) in the disk by an unknown mechanism .",
    "if such a phase reversal is a common phenomenon in a tidally induced eccentric disk , the origin of ( traditional ) late superhumps would require reconsideration .",
    "we can alternatively interpret that the later ( @xmath215 d ) hump signals are genuine superhumps and the earlier ( 0@xmath225 d ) hump signals bear the same physical characteristics of the late superhumps ( i.e. originating from a region close to the hot spot on an already eccentric disk ) .",
    "this interpretation would require a burst - like enhancement of the hot spot and a preexisting eccentric disk around the start of a superoutburst .",
    "a rapid growth of the earlier hump signals during the outburst rise @xcite seems to be against this possibility , since the release of the potential energy is expected to be reduced as the result of a rapid disk expansion during this stage @xcite .",
    "since this interpretation would require a condition keenly challenging the disk - instability model of er uma stars @xcite , we leave it an observational open question whether a hypothetical , enhanced hot spot region during the early stage of superoutbursts of er uma can explain the unique behavior of the er uma superhumps .",
