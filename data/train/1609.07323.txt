    "in recent years several models of transport dynamics have been studied ; if @xmath0 represents the density of a given population at time @xmath1 in a space location @xmath2 , the evolution of @xmath3 , whenever the total mass of the population is conserved , is described by means of the _ continuity equation _",
    "@xmath4 where @xmath5 is the velocity of the population motion .",
    "the vector field @xmath5 may depend on @xmath3 in a rather general way ; here we are interested in the cases where @xmath6 being @xmath7 an _ external velocity _ field , @xmath8 a _ self - interaction kernel _ , and @xmath9 the convolution operator @xmath10 our ambient space is a domain @xmath11 of @xmath12 , which we take bounded and regular enough ; the case of unbounded domains @xmath11 can be treated in a similar way with some technical modifications . models of the kind above have been widely considered in the literature ; we refer for instance to @xcite and to the references therein .    in the present paper we deal with an optimal control problem related to the dynamics above",
    "; more precisely , the goal is to modify the behavior of the density @xmath3 of the population by influencing the behavior of another population of agents interacting with @xmath3 , that we denote by @xmath13 .",

    "the resulting state equation governing our optimal control problem is @xmath17 with initial condition @xmath18 and boundary conditions @xmath19\\times\\partial\\o,\\ ] ] where @xmath20 with @xmath21 suitable convolution kernels .",
    "notice that , by setting @xmath22 , equation has the form of a continuity equation , where @xmath14 is an external velocity field .",
    "the dynamics of @xmath13 is determined by the minimization of a given functional @xmath23 taking into account the desired behavior of @xmath3 as well as the cost of the control agents @xmath13 ( whose mass is allowed to vary ) .",
    "it is introduced in detail in section [ svariat ] by using the general theory of functionals defined on the space of measures , developed in @xcite . under rather mild assumptions on @xmath24",
    "we establish the existence of solutions for the optimal control problem with cost functional @xmath23 subject to the pde constraint .",
    "notice that the formulation of our control problem differs significantly , for instance , from that of _ mean - field games _ , introduced in @xcite , as rather than embedding decentralized control rules inside the dynamics of @xmath3 we introduce an external control mass @xmath13 that interacts with the original population with the goal to modify its behavior .",
    "the reason to study such infinite dimensional optimal control problems instead of their discrete counterparts lies in the so - called _ curse of dimensionality _ , term introduced by richard bellman in @xcite to describe the difficulty in solving optimization problems where the dimension of the state variable ( which depends on the number of agents , in this case ) is large : the goal is to compute a nearly optimal control strategy that does not depend anymore on the number of agents .",
    "several applications may fall into our framework ; for instance    * driving a mass of pedestrian to ( or out of ) a certain location using a small number of stewards ; * trying to stabilize the stock market in order to avoid systemic failures , by acting on few key investors with a relatively limited amount of resources ; * computing the minimal amount of manually - controlled units such that a swarm of drones performs a given task ( as , for instance , wind harvesting or the recognition of a given area ) .    in the present paper we do not perform numerical simulations ; we want to stress that this issue presents several difficulties , mainly related to the nonlocal behavior of the governing state equations and to the nonconvexity of the cost functional .",
    "some numerical simulations of problems of similar type have been performed in @xcite .    after introducing the model in section [ sec : preliminaries ] and the class of admissible controls in section [ sec : admissible ] , we state in section [ svariat ] the optimal control problem rigorously and we study its well - posedness ; some variants are also considered .",

    "some interesting particular cases of the functional @xmath197 above are listed below .    1 .   our decision to let the mass of @xmath13 vary comes from the choice to allow the optimization of the quantity of control agents , in accordance with the goal to achieve .",

    "a common example is the one where we require the dynamics of the measure @xmath3 to satisfy a specific feature , like the collapse of one of its moments or marginals .",
    "an example is given by alignment models like the cucker - smale one ( see @xcite ) , where one is interested in a population of individuals @xmath3 function of a spatial variable @xmath203 and a consensus or velocity variable @xmath204 .",
    "the goal of a control strategy , in this case , is to force the alignment of the group , which in term of the state variables means that all the velocities @xmath78 s tend to coincide .",
    "this is ensured by minimizing at every instant @xmath1 and for any individual with velocity @xmath78 the square distance between @xmath78 and the mean @xmath205 : @xmath206 in more general terms , given a projection @xmath207 ( with @xmath208 , then the lagrangian @xmath134 may be of the form @xmath209 indeed , denoting by @xmath210 the center of mass of the projection of @xmath3 at time @xmath1 , the minimization of the above lagrangian leads to the convergence of @xmath211 to the measure @xmath212 for a similar problem in the context of the hegselmann - krause model for opinion formation , see @xcite .",

    "the first one prescribes a somewhat _ greedy _ approach for the optimization procedure , by asking that the distance @xmath221 can not be too large on average ( in time ) .",
    "the second one , instead , allows a greater freedom in the behavior of @xmath13 which is only prescribed to have a final distribution @xmath220 as close as possible to @xmath222 .",
    "however , one should always be aware that a greater liberty may translate into a more difficult numerical implementation ( since the number of degrees of freedom may grow out of control ) , which is an ingredient that should play a relevant role in the design of any control problem .",

    "the adoption of the space @xmath170;{\\mathcal{m}}_m(\\o))$ ] is made for the sake of generality .",
    "however , it is often the case that the dynamics of @xmath13 possesses some extra structure which let @xmath13 belong to a narrower subset of @xmath170;{\\mathcal{m}}_m(\\o))$ ] .",

    "several families of pdes ( fokker - planck , vlasov , etc@xmath226 ) determine subsets @xmath227;{\\mathcal{m}}_m(\\o))$ ] which are closed under the pointwise weak * convergence of measures : in all those cases , the functional@xmath228 is lower semicontinuous with respect to this topology , and can be used in the context of problem [ prob1 ] .",
    "problem [ prob1 ] does not prescribe any constraint on the dynamics of the control agents @xmath13 , except for its maximal speed .",

    "this is a very powerful tool from the modeling point of view , but it may create extra difficulties if we want to identify the minimizers of @xmath24 , unless optimality conditions are available , as for instance in @xcite .",
    "another way to give more structure to the dynamics of @xmath13 is to embed the desired features of it inside the functional @xmath24 , like @xmath229 where @xmath230 is a lower semicontinuous function .",

    "in this section , we consider a rather natural control problem arising in pedestrian dynamics , that can be reformulated as problem [ prob1 ] with a specific choice of the cost functional @xmath24 .    in problem [ prob2 ] ,",

    "in addition , the population @xmath13 is trying to optimize its trajectory ( the function @xmath225 ) in order to reach the goal encoded in the cost functional .",
    "as already discussed in the previous section , the goal is to evacuate the measure @xmath3 from the set @xmath214 , while at the same time penalizing too high values of the optimized velocity field @xmath225 .",
    "this problem has been treated extensively , especially under the further constraint for @xmath13 to be atomic , in @xcite .",
    "notice that , since the control mass @xmath13 is subjected to a continuity equation , its mass remains constant , and hence we may assume @xmath256 , instead of the more general @xmath257 .     where @xmath13 is the empirical measure centered on 3 atoms .",

    "the exit is only visible to the agents @xmath3 inside the circle , while @xmath13 knows the entire environment , instead . in this situation ,",
    "the interaction kernels are all repulsive at short - range , since @xmath3 and @xmath13 model pedestrians which can not overlap in space .",
    "therefore , if all the mass @xmath3 accumulates around the exit , a big queue would be formed due to self - repulsion .",
    "the mass @xmath13 avoids this by letting one of its atom wait before helping the portion of @xmath3 surrounding him : only after part of @xmath3 is already evacuated this atom moves and leads its portion of @xmath3 to the exit . in this way",
    "the congestion is much lower and the evacuation faster .    in order to establish the well - posedness of problem [ prob2 ] ,",

    "several applications of this result were shown by a list of cost functionals falling into our framework , which eventually led us to establish the well - posedness of an evacuation problem encountered in pedestrian dynamics .",

    "it is indeed clear that the closedness properties of our pde constraints are likely way stronger than necessary .",
    "in fact , while the dynamics underlying the control problem is closed under uniform convergence of the trajectories with respect to the wasserstein distance ( see lemma [ le : eqclosed ] ) , what is needed in the proof of theorem [ th : mainmin ] is simply the pointwise weak * convergence . concerning the possibility of enlarging the list of functionals presented in section [ exj ] , an interesting cost functional that was not included in our analysis",
    "is given by @xmath285 this functional penalizes the change of the mass of @xmath13 in time , and appears in contexts where hiring control agents after the dynamics has started is costlier than doing it before .",

    "the relationship between the above functional and the @xmath288cost whenever @xmath13 is subjected to a continuity equation like in is still unclear .",

    "besides the well - established methodology of the discretization of pde constrained optimal control problems by means of finite element methods , mainly applied for elliptic and parabolic type of equations ( see for instance @xcite ) , a particularly promising approach is based on their kinetic description using boltzmann models , see @xcite . in @xcite ,",
