    "one of the great opportunities offered by modern genomics is that phylogenetics applied on a genomic scale ( phylogenomics ) should be especially powerful for elucidating gene and genome evolution , relationships among species and populations , and processes of speciation and molecular evolution .",
    "however , a well - recognized hurdle is the sheer volume of genomic data that can now be generated relatively cheaply and quickly , but for which analytical tools are lagging .",
    "there is a major need to explore new approaches to undertake comparative genomic and phylogenomic studies much more rapidly and robustly than existing tools allow .",
    "principal component analysis is the most popular approach for reducing the dimension of multidimensional data sets .",
    "the problem of multidimensionality is acute in the rapidly growing area of phylogenomics , which can provide insight into relationships and evolutionary patterns of a diversity of organisms , from humans , plants and animals , to microbes and viruses .",
    "data sets consisting of collections of phylogenetic trees are challenging to analyse , due both to high dimensionality and the complexity of the space containing the data .",
    "multivariate statistical procedures such as outlier detection @xcite , clustering @xcite and multidimensional scaling @xcite have previously been applied to such data sets . however , principal component analysis is perhaps the most useful multivariate statistical tool for exploring high - dimensional data sets , due to its flexibility and its attractive properties .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite recently showed that principal component analysis automatically projects to the subspace where the global solution of k - means clustering lies , and so facilitates k - means clustering to find near - optimal solutions .",
    "although principal component analysis for data in @xmath2 can be defined in several different ways , the following description is natural for reformulating the procedure in tree - space .",
    "suppose we have data @xmath3 where @xmath4 for @xmath5 .",
    "for any set of @xmath1 points @xmath6 we can define @xmath7 so that @xmath8 is the hyperplane in @xmath2 containing @xmath9 .",
    "the orthogonal @xmath10 distance of any point @xmath11 from @xmath8 is denoted @xmath12 , and the sum of squared projected distances of the data @xmath13 onto the hyperplane is defined by @xmath14 then the @xmath0-th order principal component @xmath15 corresponds to a choice of @xmath16 which _ minimizes _ this sum . in @xmath2 , @xmath17 is the sample mean , @xmath18 is the line through the sample mean which minimizes the sum of squared projected distances , and so on for @xmath19 .",
    "although it is not explicit in the definition above , in @xmath2 the principal components are nested : @xmath20 this description of principal component analysis relies heavily on the vector space properties of @xmath2 : @xmath8 is defined as a linear combination of vectors and the procedure uses orthogonal projection .",
    "however , the space of phylogenetic trees with @xmath21 leaves is not an euclidean vector space .",
    "it follows that we can not directly apply classical principal component analysis to a data set consisting of phylogenetic trees .",
    "the set @xmath22 of all phylogenetic trees with @xmath21 leaves labelled @xmath23 is a so - called cat(0 ) space @xcite .",
    "this means that @xmath22 is a metric space with a unique geodesic ( shortest length path ) between any pair of points , with the geodesic computable in @xmath24 steps @xcite . amongst other properties ,",
    "projection onto closed sets is well - defined in cat(0 ) spaces .",
    "the analogue of the zero - th order principal component is given by the _",
    "frchet mean _ of the data @xmath25 .",
    "the frchet mean is a statistic which characterizes the central tendency of a distribution in arbitrary metric spaces . for any metric space @xmath26 equipped with metric @xmath27 , the frchet population mean , @xmath28 , with respect to distribution @xmath29",
    "is defined by @xmath30 the discrete analogue , the weighted frchet mean of a sample @xmath31 with respect to a weight vector @xmath32 , is @xmath33 where the weights @xmath34 satisfy @xmath35 for @xmath36 . in any cat(0 ) space , @xmath37 is a well - defined unique point given data @xmath13 and weight vector @xmath32 .",
    "the definition of the zero - th order principal component @xmath17 in @xmath2 given above coincides with the definition of the frchet sample mean with weights @xmath38 in any cat(0 ) space .",
    "several algorithms for computing the frchet sample mean in @xmath22 have been developed @xcite and we review these later in section  [ sec : fmalgorithms ] as they play an important role in our methodology .",
    "methods for constructing a principal geodesic in tree - space , an analogue of @xmath39 as defined above , have recently been developed . in @xcite ,",
    "the approach involved firing geodesics from some mean tree . for each candidate",
    "geodesic @xmath40 , the sum of squared projected distances @xmath41 was computed and a greedy algorithm was used to adjust @xmath40 in order to mimimize @xmath41 .",
    "the geodesics considered were infinitely long , but these have the disadvantage that in some cases many such geodesics fit the data equally well .",
    "subsequent approaches therefore considered finitely long geodesic segments @xcite .",
    "the geodesic segment between two points @xmath42 is analogous to @xmath8 in equation  @xmath43 with @xmath44 , except that the weights @xmath45 must constrained to be positive under the analogy .",
    "@xcite constrained the ends of the geodesic to be points in the sample @xmath13 and sought the corresponding geodesic @xmath40 which mimimizes @xmath41 , whereas @xcite did not restrict the geodesic and used a stochastic optimization algorithm to perform the minimization .    in this paper we address two fundamental questions : ( i ) which geometric object most naturally plays the role of a @xmath0-th order principal component in tree - space ; and ( ii ) given such an object , how can we efficiently project data points onto the object ?",
    "our proposed solution is to replace the definition of @xmath46 given in equation  @xmath43 with the locus of the weighted frchet mean of points @xmath9 in tree - space .",
    "specifically , suppose @xmath47 and define @xmath48 by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the @xmath0-dimensional simplex of probability vectors @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the frchet mean of the points in set @xmath16 with weights @xmath53 .",
    "we call @xmath8 the _ locus of the frchet mean _ of @xmath16",

    "the locus of the frchet mean is a type of _ minimal surface _ , as the following physical analogy suggests : imagine connecting a point @xmath54 to points @xmath55 by @xmath1 pieces of elastic .",
    "when the point @xmath56 is free to move , it will move under the action of the elastic into an equilibrium position in tree - space .",
    "we can imagine how this equilibrium point changes as the stiffness in the pieces of elastic is varied , which corresponds to varying @xmath57 .",
    "as the equilibrium point moves around it scans out a surface in tree - space . in euclidean space",
    "the locus of the frchet mean of some collection of points is a subset of a hyperplane . in tree - space , as we will show , the hyper - surface can be curved .",
    "surfaces of this kind have recently been studied by @xcite in the context of riemannian manifolds and other geodesic metric spaces .",
    "we discuss the relationship of the present paper to that work in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "our main theoretical results are as follows .",
    "first , when @xmath58 we derive a set of local implicit equations for @xmath8 . these allow us to derive conditions for @xmath8 to be locally flat , and also enable us to construct explicit realizations of @xmath8 in certain interesting cases .",
    "secondly , using the implicit equations we show the locus of the frchet mean @xmath8 in @xmath22 is locally @xmath0 dimensional for generic @xmath16 , and thus forms a suitable candidate for a @xmath0-th order principal component .",
    "third , we present an algorithm for projection onto @xmath8 which relies only on the cat(0 ) properties of @xmath22 .",
    "we demonstrate accuracy of the projection algorithm via a simulation study .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized in the following way .",
    "section [ review ] reviews the fundamental concepts and results in phylogenetic tree - space : the construction of geodesics , calculation of the frchet mean and convex hulls .",
    "section [ sec : lfm ] studies the geometric features of the locus of the frchet mean , in particular establishing its dimension with theorem  [ thm : lfm_dimension ] .",
    "we draw the reader s attention to section  [ sec : lfm_example ] which contains an explicit example which illustrates geodesics in tree - space , convex hulls , and details of the calculation of dimension .",
    "section [ sec : projection_and_pca ] presents the algorithm for projecting sets of phylogenetic tree data onto the locus of the frchet mean of @xmath1 fixed trees and describes the algorithm used to fit these objects to the data .",
    "this section also contains a simulation study to test the effectiveness of the algorithms . in section  [ sec : results ] we apply these methods to two data sets .",
    "the first is a set of gene trees coming from fish and tetrapods intended to investigate the relationship of coelacanth and lungfish to the tetrapods , and the second is a set of gene trees from apicomplexa .",
    "we make some concluding remarks in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "throughout the paper , the @xmath59-dimensional euclidean vector space is denoted by @xmath2 . the non - negative and positive orthants in @xmath60",
    "are denoted by @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively . for any vectors @xmath63",
    ", @xmath64 denotes the euclidean norm of @xmath65 , and @xmath66 denotes the euclidean inner product .    a _ phylogenetic tree _ with the leaf set @xmath67 is an undirected weighted acyclic graph with @xmath21 degree-@xmath68 vertices labelled @xmath23 , and with no degree-@xmath69 verices .",
    "we consider rooted trees , and the root is the leaf labelled `` 0 '' .",
    "each such tree contains @xmath21 _ pendant _ edges , which connect to the leaves , and up to @xmath70 _ internal edges_. the maximum number of internal edges is achieved when the tree is binary , in which case all vertices have degree @xmath71 other than the leaves , in which case the tree is called _",
    "fully resolved_. if a tree contains fewer edges then it is called _ unresolved _ and there must be at least one vertex with degree @xmath72 .",
    "each edge in a phylogeny is assigned a strictly positive weight ( also called the edge _ length _ ) .",
    "given a tree @xmath73 , the set of edges of @xmath65 is denoted @xmath74 , and the weight associated to @xmath75 is denoted @xmath76 .",
    "it is convenient to define @xmath76 to be zero whenever @xmath77 is not contained in @xmath65 .",
    "tree - space @xmath22 is the set of all phylogenetic trees with leaf set @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "tree - space can be embedded in @xmath79 for @xmath80 in the following way .",
    "if we cut any edge @xmath75 then the tree @xmath65 splits into two disconnected pieces .",
    "this determines a _ split _ @xmath81 of the leaf set @xmath78 , where @xmath82 and @xmath83 . by convention",
    "we choose @xmath84 to be the set containing the root 0 , and so there are @xmath85 possible splits of @xmath78 .",
    "the collection of splits represented by a tree @xmath65 is called the _",
    "topology _ of @xmath65 .",
    "since edges and splits are equivalent , we use the notation @xmath74 to also represent the set of splits in @xmath65 . by choosing some arbitrary ordering of the set of all splits , each tree",
    "@xmath73 can be represented as a vector in @xmath79 with up to @xmath86 positive entries given by the edge weights of @xmath65 , and zeros for each split which is not contained in @xmath65 .",
    "however , an arbitrary choice of vector will not necessarily represent a tree : for example the splits @xmath87 and @xmath88 can not both be contained in the same tree so any vector for which these splits both have strictly positive value does not represent a tree .",
    "two splits @xmath89 are _ compatible _ if one of the four sets @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 is empty , in which case there is at least one tree containing both splits .",
    "any collection of pairwise compatible splits determines a valid tree topology ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.1.4 ) .",
    "the embedding into euclidean space reveals the combinatorial structure of @xmath22 . every tree @xmath73 contains @xmath94 pendant edges and so @xmath22 is the product of @xmath95 and a space corresponding to the internal edges .",
    "it is therefore convenient to ignore the pendant edges , and consider the corresponding embedding of tree - space into @xmath96 . given any tree topology @xmath97 containing @xmath59 internal edges , the set of trees with topology @xmath97 corresponds to a subset @xmath98 which is isomorphic to @xmath99 .",

    "equivalently , the trees on the boundary can be obtained by taking a tree @xmath65 in @xmath100 and continuously shrinking one or more internal edges down to length zero .",
    "thus , for a fully - resolved topology @xmath97 , the codimension-@xmath68 boundaries of @xmath100 correspond to trees containing @xmath102 internal edges , and in general each codimension-@xmath0 boundary corresponds to trees containing @xmath103 internal edges , for @xmath104 .",
    "there are @xmath105 possible fully resolved rooted tree topologies and so @xmath22 is built from @xmath105 orthants isomorphic to @xmath106 together with the boundaries of these orthants which correspond to trees which are not fully resolved .",

    "orthants corresponding to fully - resolved topologies are glued at their codimension-@xmath68 boundaries in a relatively simple way .",

    "there are @xmath71 possible ways to add in an additional edge to give another fully resolved topology ( including the original edge which was removed ) so each codimension-@xmath68 face of @xmath100 is glued to two other such orthants .",

    "more information could be included in the graphical representation of our results , such as the distance of the data points from their projections , information about the principal geodesic , and the proximity of points to orthant boundaries .",
    "we presented the geometric projection algorithm without a proof of convergence , and used simulation to assess its accuracy .",
    "the algorithm is attractive in that it is defined entirely in terms of the geodesic structure on tree - space , and so it could be used on any geodesic metric space , including riemannian manifolds .",
    "the algorithm clearly deserves further investigation , and we aim to study its properties in a future publication .",

    "<S> most biological data are multidimensional , posing a major challenge to human comprehension and computational analysis . </S>",
    "<S> principal component analysis is the most popular approach to rendering two- or three - dimensional representations of the major trends in such multidimensional data . </S>",
    "<S> the problem of multidimensionality is acute in the rapidly growing area of phylogenomics . </S>",
    "<S> evolutionary relationships are represented by phylogenetic trees , and very typically a phylogenomic analysis results in a collection of such trees , one for each gene in the analysis . </S>",
    "<S> principal component analysis offers a means of quantifying variation and summarizing a collection of phylogenies by dimensional reduction . </S>",
    "<S> however , the space of all possible phylogenies on a fixed set of species does not form a euclidean vector space , so principal component analysis must be reformulated in the geometry of tree - space , which is a cat(0 ) geodesic metric space . </S>",
    "<S> previous work has focused on construction of the first principal component , or principal geodesic . here </S>",
    "<S> we propose a geometric object which represents a @xmath0-th order principal component : the locus of the weighted frchet mean of @xmath1 points in tree - space , where the weights vary over the standard @xmath0-dimensional simplex . </S>",
    "<S> we establish basic properties of these objects , in particular that locally they generically have dimension @xmath0 , and we propose an efficient algorithm for projection onto these surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> combined with a stochastic optimization algorithm , this projection algorithm gives a procedure for constructing a principal component of arbitrary order in tree - space . </S>",
    "<S> simulation studies confirm these algorithms perform well , and they are applied to data sets of apicomplexa gene trees and the african coelacanth genome . </S>",
    "<S> the results enable visualizations of slices of tree - space , revealing structure within these complex data sets . </S>"
