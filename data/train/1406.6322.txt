    "in the last few decades , special attention has sparked amongst statistical physicists the study of elections  @xcite .",
    "an election can be seen as a large scale event that provides a huge amount of real data about people choices resulting from collective processes . then , its analysis may reveal important hints on how people are influenced and opinions propagate .",
    "the number of data is particularly huge in countries such as brazil , with a large and diversified electorate .",
    "moreover , differently from the case of presidential or governor elections , with few candidates , in an election for legislators or for city councillors , there is also a large number of candidates , of the order of a few thousands in the whole country .",
    "this provides a wide spectrum of choices that allow to probe how people preferences distribute .    plausibly following these motivations , pioneering works analyzed the brazilian proportional elections of 1998  @xcite , for federal and state deputies in the most populated states so paulo and minas gerais .",
    "it was first claimed that the probability density function ( pdf ) of the number of votes @xmath0 for deputies presented , as a common feature , a power law decay @xmath3 , with exponent @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "diverse opinion dynamics models were then proposed to explain such behavior  @xcite .",
    "the simple sznajd dynamics ( only agreeing pairs of individuals can convince their neighbors  @xcite ) appeared to be enough to explain the power - law exponent @xmath4 .",
    "a robust result almost independent of the network properties  @xcite .",
    "a simple contagion model  @xcite was also able to reproduce the @xmath5 behavior , but the small - world effect appeared to be crucial in that case .    for brazilian city councillors ,",
    "the exponent was found to be larger than unit  @xcite .",
    "elections with proportional rules in other countries were also analyzed , like india  @xcite , finland  @xcite and italy  @xcite , revealing that the power - law exponent , or even the power - law itself , was not robust  @xcite .",
    "as a consequence , it was argued that an essential feature to capture a universal behavior was to take into account the role of parties  @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is sound that a voter chooses first a party , following its ideology , and then the voter chooses a candidate belonging to that party .",
    "moreover , voters may be influenced by the fact that the total amount of votes for a party will decide the corresponding number of seats",
    ". however , at least in the brazilian elections , several features hamper a meaningful normalization by party : i )  electoral choices largely rely on the personal characteristics of candidates  @xcite and although voting for a party is allowed , most people vote mainly for candidates directly ( within an open list system ) , ii ) there are over 30 political parties , distributed in a broad spectrum of orientations  @xcite but parties occasionally merge together or split and there are also alliances , in some cases of mixed political orientation , and iii ) there are no electoral thresholds to disqualify parties with low representativity . then , we will not tackle here aspects related to parties .",
    "we aim to gain insights on the formation of preferences of the electorate about candidates only .",
    "we analyze brazilian elections for legislators during the period 1970 - 2010 , for which data are available at the website of the brazilian federal electoral court  @xcite .",
    "this period encompasses elections that took place during the civilian governments after 1986 , as well as during the precedent military dictatorship , allowing to investigate the impact of very different political regimes on vote distributions .",
    "complementarily , we also consider the elections for city councillors during 2000 - 2012 .",

    "@xmath0 also decays as a power - law , although the plateau phase is lacking , reflecting the absence of candidates with few votes . in fig .",

    "notice the coincidence of the pdfs in the scale - free region , for the three different elections with different candidates but the same electorate .",
    "the present statistical analysis indicates that : i ) @xmath2 is not universal , ii ) it tends to increase with time , iii ) for a given electorate , it takes a defined value .",
    "that is , @xmath2 seems to be associated to some property of the electorate or its interactions , independently of the pool of candidates and beyond the electorate size .",
    "therefore , the scale - free regime may reflect a fundamental feature of the complex collective processes involved .",
    "previously proposed models reproduce the @xmath5 law but do not allow to describe the pdf decay of the form @xmath11 with generic @xmath2 that we observe in real data .",
    "we propose a simple model , where we describe the temporal evolution of the quantity of votes @xmath12 received by each candidate @xmath13 as a continuous variable .",
    "this is justified by the fact that the fractions @xmath14 tend to assume continuous values in the limit of a very large number of voters . in analogy to multi - species models of population dynamics , we consider that the number of voters for candidate @xmath13 , hence the quantity of votes @xmath15 , follows a logistic - like growth dynamics .",
    "then , the time evolution is governed by a set of ordinary differential equations of the form @xmath16 for @xmath17 , where @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are positive parameters , and @xmath21 limits the quantity of votes .",
    "randomness is a realistic ingredient of social dynamics , relative both to individual attitudes and to social influences  @xcite .",
    "then , one should consider in principle the equation parameters as stochastic variables to reflect the heterogeneity of the electorate and its interactions .",
    "however , for simplicity , we will assume heterogeneity in the parameters where it is more crucial , as discussed below .",
    "the coefficient @xmath18 represents a kind of fitness of candidate @xmath13 .",
    "it is related to the capacity of persuasion determined by a set of attributes attached to the candidate , such as its political proposal or personal appeal .",
    "a negative value would lead to a vanishing fraction of votes . then",
    ", for the candidates that win votes , the parameter @xmath18 should take positive values .",
    "we consider that the population of candidates is heterogeneous with respect to this parameter , according to a given pdf @xmath22 . a similar kind of heterogeneity has been assumed in the cellular automata of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the probability of convincing is different for each candidate in a first stage where only candidates can influence voters .",
    "the propagation of opinions about candidates is a sort of branching or multiplicative process  @xcite , in which a supporter of a given candidate can persuade , with a given probability , a fraction of its neighbors , and each one of them in turn can influence others . in the standard case ,",
    "the intrinsic rate of growth per capita of the number of votes @xmath15 is constant , given by @xmath18 . however , if there were a positive feedback between individuals , the rate per capita would increase with @xmath15 , which can be described by @xmath23 .",
    "a similar idea of self - reinforcing mechanisms , that can lead to herding behavior , have already been considered in the context of financial bubbles  @xcite . but",
    "avalanches of opinion propagation can occur in other contexts too  @xcite .",
    "the `` better connected '' is the electorate , the larger @xmath20 .",
    "this does not mean higher mean connectivity or higher probability of contagion , but that the probability of contagion becomes larger as the number of followers increases .",
    "a negative feedback may also occur and is represented by @xmath24 .",
    "it is true that one could associate a different @xmath20 to each candidate , reflecting the particular feedback of the community in which the candidate exerts influence .",
    "however , we will consider that @xmath20 is predominantly homogeneous across a given electorate .",
    "the introduction of parameter @xmath19 allows to contemplate the existence of two realistic regimes , as considered in a previous model of elections @xcite . in an initial phase when @xmath25 , candidates influence voters either directly or through their staff , independently of the number of followers of each candidate . otherwise , when the number of followers becomes large enough , people interact and become influenced by other electors too .",
    "then @xmath19 can be related to the spreading which is independent of the number of followers @xmath15 , and may also include the effect of the media through which a candidate can spread its influence and gain voters .",
    "this parameter could be in principle a random parameter , different for each candidate , but also in this case we will take it as homogeneous .",
    "finally , we consider a logistic factor of the general form @xmath26 that assumes that each quantity of votes @xmath15 follows a logistic growth , up to a maximum value @xmath27 , with @xmath28 , corresponding to the portion of the electorate a candidate would conquer in the absence of other candidates .",
    "the last term is responsible for coupling the equations and describes the inter - specific competition amongst candidates in their struggle for conquering voters , where @xmath29 measures the competitive effect of candidate @xmath30 on candidate @xmath13 . in modeling voting processes ,",
    "it is commonly considered as a more realistic situation , that when the election occurs the opinion dynamics has not necessarily attained yet the steady state  @xcite .",
    "then , as soon as the logistic term affects only the long - time dynamics , for simplicity , we consider that @xmath31 , @xmath32 .    besides randomness in the equation parameters , another source of variability may reside in the initial distribution of votes @xmath33 .",
    "it is clear that there are candidates with a political history and hence may start with a given community of followers , then , it would be interesting to investigate realistic initial distributions . however ,",
    "if the initial numbers of votes are relatively small , as expected for the majority of the candidates , their precise values will not affect the distribution at later times , at least for @xmath34 .",
    "then we will set @xmath35 for all candidate @xmath13 , corresponding to the minimal value of its own vote .",
    "summarizing the model description , under the above assumptions , the evolution equations are reduced to the simple form @xmath36 for @xmath37 , where @xmath20 and @xmath19 are positive constants and @xmath18 is the only random parameter .",
    "we assume that it is uniformly distributed in @xmath38 $ ] .",
    "( notice that introducing a different maximal value of @xmath39 will be equivalent to rescaling the time , then we chose the unit interval . )",
    "that is , the model depends on only two parameters that appear to be the most relevant ones . from the numerical integration of this set of differential equations , we obtained @xmath0 .",
    "we considered the values of @xmath15 at the steady state , however the results of the model are not significantly affected if we do not wait for the steady state to be reached .",
    "as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] , the model produces outcomes qualitatively similar to the empirical ones , with a flat region and a power - law decay .",
    "notice however that the last phase of rapid decay of the distribution is not present .",
    "in fact , as discussed above , very popular candidates gaining very large numbers of votes are those contributing to the cutoff , but they are not contemplated by our model in its present form , which assumes a uniform distribution of @xmath39 .",
    "this could be readily improved by modifying @xmath40 , to take into account people with outstanding fitness , but we are interested here in the free - scale regime .     from model simulations of the set of eqs .",

    "[ fig : picture ] .",
    "it illustrates the two mechanisms of dissemination of ideas of a candidate @xmath13 : i ) without participation of the electorate , for low @xmath15 compared to @xmath19 the propaganda of the candidate dominates the diffusion process , and ii ) when the number of followers @xmath15 is large enough , the phase of interactivity of the electorate occurs with feedback ( @xmath47 ) or without it ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "the ( positive ) feedback is represented in the picture by thicker lines . in the measure",
    "than the number of followers of a candidate grows , the probability or rate per capita of convincing the nearest neighbors in the network of contacts also increases .",
    "the scale free regime is associated precisely to this interactive phase .",
    "actually , there is a third regime , when the number of undecided people becomes small ( @xmath49 , hence the factor @xmath50 tends to zero ) , a phase of competition between candidates operates , that is not represented in the picture .",
    "the distribution @xmath0 resulting from the model can be analytically evaluated . at sufficiently short times",
    "the evolution of @xmath51 will not feel the competition term and the equations are uncoupled .",
    "this corresponds to an initial phase in which voters interact mainly with candidates in its network of influence .",

    "this approximate expression is in good accord with the results of the numerical integration of the model ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : model ] ) .",
    "it also satisfactorily describes real distributions , with only two parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 , which control the crossover , between the plateau and the scale - free regimes , and the power - law decay , respectively .",
    "then eq .",
    "( [ teo1 ] ) allows to identify the fitting exponent @xmath2 with the intrinsic exponent @xmath20 , furnishing a direct interpretation for the origin of the scale - free regime .",
    "namely , the exponent @xmath62 can be associated to the degree of feedback of the spreading processes .",
    "let us first analyze size effects . in all the empirical cases the electorate size , measured by @xmath9 , is very large compared to the number of candidates @xmath10 . within the realistic range in which @xmath63 holds , the effect of an increase of @xmath9 on the pdf of votes ( not shown ) is to extend the power law range , as soon as larger values of @xmath1 become possible . as a consequence , the flat level decreases to preserve the norm .",

    "but , even in its present form , it captures the more relevant ingredients and it is able to model real data . in particular , the model allow to relate the scale - free regime to the degree of feedback in the electorate interactivity .",
    "the changes of @xmath2 with time and the larger values of @xmath2 observed for urban centers are consistent with this view .",
    "it is remarkable that election statistics furnishes a measure , through the effective parameter @xmath2 , of the population interactivity feedback which rules the propagation of electoral preferences .",
    "this measure could be taken into account to design campaign strategies according to the electorate mood .",
    "but it may be useful also in other contexts since it reflects a property of the population interactivity , which governs the propagation of opinions and influences .",
    "this work was supported by the brazilian funding agencies capes , cnpq and faperj .",
    "we analyzed the nominal votes of the elections for different kinds of legislators in brazil ( senators , federal deputies and state deputies ) and also city councillors .",
    "senators and federal deputies are congressmen , representatives of a given state ( from a total of 26 states in the federation and a federal district ) , in the senate and in the chamber of deputies of the national congress , respectively .",
    "while federal deputies are in proportion to the population of the respective state , there is a fixed number of senators for any state ( 3 per state , hence a total of 81 , including the federal district ) .",
    "state deputies are local representatives elected to serve in the unicameral legislature of each state .",
    "all deputies serve during a four - year term , while senators serve during eight - year terms , being renewed one - third and two - thirds of the senate in alternate electoral calendars .",
    "all these elections occur simultaneously in the same countrywide electoral event , together with the election for president and governors , at four - year intervals . from a pool of candidates in each state",
    ", an elector can choose one name of each class ( two senators , instead of one , in the years when two - thirds are renewed ) .",
    "councillors serve during four - year terms in each city council and are voted in the same municipal election in which voters chose mayors , every four years , in even years alternating with presidential elections .    in the proportional elections here",
    "considered , besides the possibility of voting on a candidate ( nominal vote ) , a citizen can vote directly on a party ( the so called `` legenda '' vote ) , without specifying a particular candidate .",
    "actually , only a minority of the electorate practices this possibility ( 4 - 18% ) .",
    "let us also mention that abstention , invalid votes and blank votes are all ignored in vote counting for proportional seat allocation purposes .",
    "we scrutinized the distribution of votes for candidates ( nominal votes ) only .",
    "that is , blank , invalid votes , as well as , valid legenda votes were not taken into account , following our aim of gaining insights on the formation of opinions about candidates .",
    "electoral sizes are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : summary ] . the quantity of ( valid nominal ) votes , @xmath9 , and the number of candidates , @xmath10 , for deputies and senators of all the states together vs the electoral year are plotted .",
    "both kinds of deputies are voted in the same electoral event and only one name can be indicated by each voter , then the respective total number of voters ( hence of votes ) @xmath9 are very close .",
    "the same occurs for senators , except that two names , instead of one , can be elected in alternate calendars when two - thirds of the senate is renewed , hence the quantity of votes is about twice the quantity of votes for deputies in those occasions .",
    "the total of candidates @xmath10 for the state legislatures is always larger than for the national one , reflecting the larger number of total seats to be assigned .",
    "the number of candidatures for senators is still smaller , not only because the number of seats is smaller but also because senators must meet more requirements for eligibility .",
    "the number of candidates was lower during the military dictatorship due to the several restrictions , increased after the restoration of pluripartidism in 1980 and attained a relative stabilization at a higher level after 1986 .",
    "the number of parties @xmath72 is also represented , evincing the period of bipartidism during the dictatorship and the progressive reintroduction of the multiparty system .    ,",
    "number of candidates @xmath10 and number of parties @xmath72 for state ( hollow ) and federal ( filled symbols ) deputies , and for senators ( half - filled symbols ) , as a function of the electoral year .",
    "data for all the brazilian states were accumulated , including the federal district of brasilia for senators .",
    "data for 1994 were unavailable . ]                                        actually errors are larger than the bars in the figures , because these include only the error in the fitting parameter due to data fluctuations but do not include the error associated to the selection of the fitting interval ."
