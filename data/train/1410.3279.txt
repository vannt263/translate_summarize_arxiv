    "unfortunately , an analytical formula in the three flavor mixing scheme in matter is quite complicated . in 2002",

    "in general , however , adiabatic approximation may not be good , and in this talk i discuss nonadiabatic contributions to the oscillation probability .",
    "when there are more than two neutrino mass eigenstates , there can be more than one level crossing .",

    "i show how to derive the expression for the effective mixing angle in the presence of the matter using the kty formalism .",
    "our strategy here is to start with effective matrix elements @xmath38 which are obtained by the kty formalism and to determine the phase of each element by demanding that it be consistent with the standard parametrization of the mixing matrix element : @xmath39 where @xmath40 are the gell - mann matrices defined by @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 . from the identity @xmath45",

    "@xcite for details ) . comparing eqs.([param1 ] ) and ( [ utilde1 ] ) , we find = -5 mm @xmath56 the quantities @xmath38 and @xmath57 in eqs.([theta12tilde])([deltatilde ] ) are expressed in closed form by the known variables as is seen in eq.([solx ] ) on the assumption that analytical expressions for all the eigenvalues are known.)([deltatilde ] ) are the results for the case of the general potential . ] .",
    "the standard parametrization ( [ param1 ] ) is not the only one for @xmath58 unitary matrices , and other parametrizations are possible as is described in appendix b of ref .",
    "@xcite . in the three flavor case",
    ", there can be at most two level crossings .",
    "depending on which pair of the energy eigenvalues gets close at each level crossing , the relevant effective mixing angle varies .",
    "the appropriate parametrization is the one in which the orthogonal matrix , which mixes the two energy eigenstates , is located on the most right - hand side of the unitary matrix @xmath59 , because in such a parametrization the diagonalized matrix looks like @xmath60 , and it becomes clear that @xmath61 in the orthogonal matrix @xmath62 plays a role of the effective mixing angle which mixes the energy eigenstates with the energy @xmath18 and @xmath63 .",
    "furthermore in order for the effective mixing angle @xmath61 to be consistent with the two flavor description , @xmath61 should become maximal at the level crossing .",
    "thus , while the effective mixing angle at @xmath21 is @xmath64 defined by ( [ theta12tilde ] ) for the standard parametrization ( [ param1 ] ) , the one at @xmath20 should be @xmath65 defined by @xmath66 for the parametrization @xmath67 where @xmath68 . from the analogy with the two flavor case ,",
    "the jumping factors @xmath36 and @xmath37 are given by @xmath69 @xmath65 and @xmath64 are defined by ( [ varphi12tilde ] ) and ( [ theta12tilde ] ) , and @xmath70 is the factor which depends on the form of the potential @xmath23 , and @xmath71 in the case of a linear potential .",
    "now i discuss two examples to demonstrate how the general discussions in the previous section are applied .",

    "the dimensionless quantities @xmath74 stand for possible deviation from the standard matter effect .",

    "the mass matrix ( [ matrixnp ] ) can be written as = -8 mm @xmath89 \\nonumber\\\\ & & ~~\\times e^{-i\\omega_3\\lambda_3 } e^{-i\\omega_9\\lambda_9 } e^{i\\beta\\lambda_5}e^{-i\\gamma'\\lambda_9 } , \\label{matrixnp2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the phases @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , which are defined in appendix c of ref .",
    "@xcite , are introduced to make @xmath94 consistent with the standard parametrization ( [ param1 ] ) .",
    "the expressions for th mixing angles @xmath95 and the cp phase @xmath96 in the standard parametrization of @xmath94 are given in ref .",
    "@xcite . among others the mixing angles",
    "@xmath97 and @xmath98 are given by @xmath99 where @xmath100 , @xmath101 .",
    "the inside of the square bracket in the mass matrix ( [ matrixnp2 ] ) has exactly the same form as that of the standard case with replacement @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "furthermore , at the two level - crossings specified by @xmath105 and @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 become @xmath109 , respectively .",
    "therefore , @xmath107 and @xmath108 can be regarded as the appropriate mixing angles to describe the nonadiabatic transition at the two level - crossings .",
    "hence we can deduce the jumping factors at the two level - crossings was given first in ref.@xcite whose result agrees with ours . ] : = -2 mm @xmath110    to estimate the effective mixing matrix elements at the origin @xmath111 , we assume that the matter effect @xmath112 is much larger than the energy difference @xmath113 . in this case",
    "we can ignore the term @xmath114 in eq.([matrixb2 ] ) , and eq.([np2 ] ) indicates that the mixing matrix @xmath46 is given by @xmath115 , and we get @xmath116 from eqs.([p3 ] ) , ( [ phnp ] ) , ( [ plnp ] ) and ( [ u0np ] ) , we can obtain the transition probability @xmath117 in the case with the nonstandard neutrino interaction in propagation .",
    "the second example is the case where there are three active neutrinos with magnetic moments and a large magnetic field .",
    "this is an example where the energy eigenvalues can not be expressed as roots of a quadratic equation , and this case demonstrates the usefulness of the kty formalism . here",
    "we assume the magnetic interaction of majorana type @xmath118 , and in this case the magnetic moments @xmath119 are real and anti - symmetric in flavor indices : @xmath120 .",
    "@xmath121 with @xmath122 is the hermitian mass matrix for neutrinos and anti - neutrinos without the matter effect where neutrinos have the magnetic moments @xmath119 in the magnetic field @xmath123 .    for simplicity",
    "we consider the limit @xmath124 and @xmath125 , and we assume that all the cp phases vanish .",
    "then the matrix ( [ matrixb ] ) can be rewritten as = -5 mm @xmath126 so the problem of diagonalizing the @xmath127 matrix ( [ matrixb ] ) is reduced to diagonalizing the @xmath128 matrices @xmath129 .",
    "since we are assuming that all the cp phases vanish , all the matrix elements @xmath130 and @xmath131 are real , @xmath129 can be diagonalized by a unitary matrix and its complex conjugate : @xmath132 and the equation for motion is given by = -5 mm @xmath133    introducing the notations @xmath134 it can be shown  @xcite that eq.([matrixb2 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath135 \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times e^{-i\\omega\\lambda_2}\\ , e^{-i{\\theta}_{23}\\lambda_7}\\ , , \\label{matrixb4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 are defined by @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 .",
    "since the we are mainly interested in the effective mixing angle which mixes the two energy eigenstates , the matrices @xmath142 on the left - hand side and @xmath143 on the right - hand side of the square bracket in eq.([matrixb4 ] ) are irrelevant , so we discuss the following matrix : = -7 mm @xmath144 where a matrix which is proportional to identity was subtracted for convenience in later calculations so that the trace of @xmath145 vanishes .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath18 of the matrix @xmath145 are given by @xmath146 @xmath147 , where @xmath148 . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the three eigenvalues @xmath149 which are normalized by @xmath150 are depicted as a function of @xmath151 .",
    "if @xmath138 is small , then the two of the three eigenvalues get close to each other , and @xmath138 can be regarded as the vacuum mixing angle near the level - crossing in the present case . in this example , for a large value of @xmath152 , the energy eigenvalues are @xmath153 and @xmath154 , and we found that there is only one level - crossing for @xmath155 , unlike in the standard three flavor case .",
    "so in the following we discuss the contribution from one level - crossing only .",
    "the behaviors of the normalized eigenvalues @xmath156 and @xmath157 as functions of @xmath151 .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for details.,width=340 ]    furthermore , it can be shown  @xcite that the following relation holds : @xmath158 where we have assumed that the level - crossing occurs between the energy eigenstates 2 and 3 , and we have assumed that there is no magnetic field at the endpoint @xmath159 , and @xmath160 in the transition probability can be obtained from the kty formula ( [ solx ] ) .    in the approximation of the small mixing angle @xmath138 ,",
    "the jumping factor @xmath36 can be calculated as  @xcite @xmath161 it can be also shown that the exponent of the jumping factor @xmath36 coincides with @xmath162 times the @xmath163 factor in the case of a linear potential ( @xmath71 ) : @xmath164",
    "using the formalism which was developed by kimura , takamura and yokomakura to express analytically the combination @xmath165 of the mixing matrix elements in matter with constant density , we have shown that the effective mixing angle can be analytically expressed in terms of the mixing matrix elements in vacuum and the energy eigenvalues .",
    "the analytical expression for the effective mixing angle enables us to evaluate the nonadiabatic contribution to the transition probability based on the two assumptions : ( i ) the nonadiabatic transitions in the case with more than two energy eigenstates can be separately treated as a two state problem at each level crossing .",
    "( ii ) the exponent of the probability obtained by the wkb method is proportional to the factor @xmath163 which is the ratio of the energy difference of the two eigenstates to the derivative of the effective mixing angle at the level crossing .",
