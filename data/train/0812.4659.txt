    "although historically supersymmetric quantum mechanics ( susy qm ) was originally introduced by witten @xcite as a toy model of studying patterns of supersymmetry breakings , it was soon recognized that susy qm was interesting in its own right ; for example , it provides a systematic description of categorizing analytically solvable potentials using the so - called shape invariance ( see for review @xcite ) .",
    "schrdinger equations with shape invariant potentials can be solved algebraically with the aid of supersymmetry .",
    "susy qm also appears in various contexts of physics ; it is related to soliton physics @xcite including inverse scattering problems @xcite , two - dimensional quantum field theories @xcite , supersymmetric lattice models leaving time - direction continuous @xcite , integrable models such as the calogero model and its application to black hole physics @xcite , and quantum mechanics with point singularities @xcite .",
    "recently it was shown that in higher dimensional gauge theories with extra compact dimensions there always exists an @xmath1 quantum mechanical supersymmetry ( qm susy ) in the 4d spectrum ; the kaluza - klein mass eigenvalue problems are equivalent to energy eigenvalue problems in @xmath0 susy qm @xcite . the @xmath1 qm susy can be regarded as a remnant of the higher - dimensional gauge invariance , and plays an essential role to generate an infinite tower of massive spin-1 particles . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "it was pointed out that a hierarchical mass spectrum can naturally arise in the context of a higher dimensional gauge theory with a warped metric and give a solution to the gauge hierarchy problem , in which the @xmath1 qm susy turns out to play a crucial role .",
    "since the extra dimension is compactified , the corresponding supersymmetric quantum mechanical systems are of course constrained to bounded domains .",
    "there , boundary conditions are very important not only for the infrared regime but also for the ultraviolet regime , and play an essential role to determine the 4d particle spectrum especially for the low energy levels or massless mode .",
    "when the compactified dimension does not respect the translational invariance due to the presence of extended defects ( branes or boundaries ) , boundary effects also play a significant role in the ultraviolet regime as boundary localized divergent terms @xcite .",
    "such localized ultraviolet divergences must be renormalized by field theory operators on the boundary and give rise to nontrivial renormalization group flows for brane localized theory @xcite .",
    "since any gauge invariant field theory possesses the @xmath1 qm susy , the boundary conditions and the @xmath1 qm susy must be compatible with each other . in this paper",
    "we will address this issue from the supersymmetric quantum mechanics point of view : we analyze the possible boundary conditions in one - dimensional @xmath1 susy qm on a bounded domain @xmath2 .    the analysis developed in @xcite",
    "was extended to 5d gravity @xcite . in 5d gravity",
    "it was shown that _ two _ @xmath1 susys are hidden in the 4d spectrum .",
    "the two @xmath1 susys can be regarded as a remnant of higher - dimensional general coordinate invariance , and are needed in order for the `` higgs '' mechanism to generate massive spin-2 particles ; one of the two quantum mechanical susys ensures the degeneracy between spin-2 and spin-1 excitations and the other between spin-1 and spin-0 excitations",
    ". a crucial ingredient of this coexistence of two quantum mechanical susys is the refactorization of hamiltonians ( laplace operators ) . in view of these facts",
    "it would be natural to guess that in a higher - dimensional spin-@xmath3 field theory there would exist @xmath3 @xmath1 susys in the 4d mass spectrum . in this paper",
    "we will also investigate whether it is possible to construct such a hierarchy of @xmath3 susys without conflicting with the boundary conditions .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : bc ] we analyze the possible boundary conditions in @xmath1 susy qm on a bounded domain @xmath2 .",
    "we show that the allowed boundary conditions in @xmath1 susy qm is limited to the so - called scale - independent subfamily of the @xmath4 family of boundary conditions @xcite . in section [ sec : refactorization ] we construct a hierarchy of @xmath3 susys by solving the refactorization condition .",
    "the results coincide with the so - called isospectral deformations of the hamiltonian @xcite . in section [ sec : hierarchy ] we analyze the allowed boundary conditions of quantum mechanical system with @xmath3 susys on an interval and on a circle separately and present a systematic prescription to construct a hierarchy of isospectral hamiltonians .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to conclusions and discussions .",
    "hermiticity of hamiltonian is the basic principle in quantum theory ; it leads to the unitarity of the s - matrix or the conservation of probability in the whole quantum system . in one - dimensional non - supersymmetric",
    "quantum mechanics it is known that the most general boundary conditions consistent with the hermiticity of hamiltonian are characterized by a @xmath5 unitary matrix @xmath6 @xcite . in one - dimensional @xmath1 susy qm , however , supersymmetry imposes more severe constraints on the parameter space of this @xmath4 family of boundary conditions . as we will show below the possible boundary conditions consistent with @xmath1 supersymmetry",
    "are limited to the so - called scale - independent subfamily of the @xmath4 family of boundary conditions .    to begin with",
    "let us consider @xmath1 susy qm on a finite domain @xmath7 , whose hamiltonians are given by supersymmetry will be transparent by introducing the following @xmath8 matrix operators @xmath9 which satisfy the standard @xmath0 supersymmetry algebra @xmath10 = 0 , \\quad [ ( -1)^{f } , \\mathscr{h } ] = 0 , \\quad \\{(-1)^{f } , \\mathscr{q}_{i}\\ } = 0 , \\quad i , j = 1,2 .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ]    @xmath11    the supercharge @xmath12 and its adjoint @xmath13 are given by    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is a superpotential ( or prepotential ) , which must be a real function in order to guarantee the hermiticity of the hamiltonians , and prime ( @xmath16 ) indicates the derivative with respect to @xmath17 . in terms of the zero - mode function",
    "@xmath18 satisfying the equation @xmath19 , the superpotential @xmath15 can be written as @xmath20 supersymmetric relations are    @xmath21    where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are eigenfunctions of @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively , with the common energy @xmath26 . in this paper",
    "we will concentrate on a finite superpotential on the whole domain .",
    "in other words , we require that @xmath18 has no zero point ( or no node ) .",
    "next we will focus on the hermiticity of @xmath24 and then derive the allowed boundary conditions for @xmath22 and @xmath23 using the supersymmetric relations . in physical language , the hermiticity of the hamiltonian @xmath24 indicates the conservation of probability in the whole system @xmath27 , where the probability current density @xmath28 is defined by @xmath29 .",
    "it is more suitable for the following discussion to rewrite the probability current density into the following form @xmath30 , \\label{eq:2.6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which follows from the real - valued superpotential .",
    "there are two physically distinct cases :    1 .",
    "case @xmath31 .",
    "+ in this case the probability current density @xmath28 does not flow outside the domain and the probability is locally conserved . hence the two ends of the domain @xmath32 and @xmath33 are physically disconnected and we will refer to this case as an interval case .",
    "2 .   case @xmath34 .",
    "+ in this case @xmath28 flows outside the domain but the probability is globally conserved as an entire system , which implies that the two ends of the domain are physically connected .",
    "hence we will refer to this case as a circle case .",
    "although in this case the end points @xmath32 and @xmath33 are physically identified , there is no need the superpotential @xmath15 to be a periodic function ; when the superpotential does not have a periodicity of @xmath33 , there just arises some kind of singularity at the junction point @xmath35 , which can be characterized by the boundary conditions just as in the point interactions @xcite .    in the following subsections",
    "we will study these two cases separately .",
    "we first investigate the condition @xmath31 .",
    "note that the condition @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ; @xmath38 ) can be written as follows : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is an arbitrary real constant of mass dimension @xmath41 , which is just introduced to adjust the mass dimension of the equation . as we will see below @xmath40",
    "is not a parameter characterizing the boundary conditions .",
    "the above equation implies that the two complex numbers @xmath42 and @xmath43 are different from each other at most only in a phase factor .",
    "thus we can write @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "when one considers a non - supersymmetric quantum mechanics , this is the end of the story by just replacing the supercharge @xmath12 to the ordinary derivative @xmath47 , and the resulting boundary conditions are parameterized by the group @xmath48 , whose parameter space is a 2-torus @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "however , supersymmetry severely restricts the allowed parameter space . using the supersymmetric relations and we find    @xmath50    since the boundary conditions should not depend on the eigenvalue @xmath26 ( otherwise the superposition of the quantum states becomes meaningless ) , the parameters @xmath51 ( @xmath46 ) must be @xmath52 or @xmath53 .",
    "thus in @xmath1 susy qm on an interval the boundary conditions compatible with the supersymmetry are characterized by the discrete group @xmath54 , which just consists of four 0-dimensional points @xmath55 .",
    "this result is consistent with the previous analyses of susy qm with point singularities @xcite .",
    "now it is clear that the allowed boundary conditions can be categorized into the following @xmath56 types :    @xmath57      next investigate the condition @xmath34 .",
    "this condition can be written into the following form @xmath58 where for any function @xmath59 the two - component boundary value vector @xmath60 is defined as @xmath61 @xmath62 is the third pauli matrix : @xmath63 .",
    "this equation shows that the squared length of the two - dimensional complex column vector @xmath64 is equal to that of @xmath65 , which implies that these two vectors must be related by a two - dimensional unitary transformation .",
    "thus we can write @xmath66 where @xmath6 is an arbitrary @xmath5 unitary matrix . in one - dimensional non - supersymmetric",
    "quantum mechanics it is known that the most general boundary conditions are characterized by this @xmath4 family @xcite . in the following we shall determine the possible form of this unitary matrix compatible with supersymmetry and find the allowed subspace of the @xmath4 family .    to this end",
    "we first apply the supersymmetric relations to the condition . using the supersymmetric relations",
    "and we find    @xmath67    again since the boundary conditions should not depend of the eigenvalue @xmath26 , the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath6 must be @xmath68 or @xmath41 , which is equivalent to the condition @xmath69 .",
    "notice that any unitary matrix satisfying @xmath69 can be spectrally decomposed using the projection operators @xmath70 and @xmath71 , which satisfy @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "multiplying these projection operators the above boundary conditions boil down to the following four independent conditions :    @xmath75    note that when @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) these boundary conditions reduce to type ( @xmath78 ) ( type ( @xmath79 ) ) boundary conditions in the interval case and lead to @xmath31 .",
    "thus in this circle case these two `` points '' @xmath80 and @xmath81 have to be removed from the parameter space , from which we conclude that the two eigenvalues of @xmath6 must be @xmath68 and @xmath41 .",
    "such a unitary matrix can be written as follows : @xmath82 where @xmath83 are the pauli matrices and @xmath84 is a unit vector , which can be parameterized as @xmath85 notice that when @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) , that is , @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) , the boundary conditions become type ( @xmath90 ) ( type ( @xmath91 ) ) boundary conditions in the interval case and again lead to @xmath31 . thus in the circle case",
    "these two `` points '' @xmath88 and @xmath92 , which correspond to the north pole @xmath86 and the south pole @xmath87 of @xmath93 , respectively , must be removed from the parameter space @xmath93 .",
    "the resulting parameter space is thus isomorphic to a non - compact two - dimensional cylinder . in summary",
    "the boundary conditions compatible with @xmath1 supersymmetry have a two - parameter family , which can be written as    @xmath94    where @xmath95 and @xmath96 . in practical calculations",
    "it is convenient to introduce a real parameter @xmath97 defined as @xmath98 before closing this section , we should make a comment on physical meanings of these two parameters @xmath99 and @xmath97 . as is well - known , @xmath99 corresponds to the magnetic flux penetrating through the circle . on the other hand , as shown in @xcite , boundary conditions with nonzero @xmath97 corresponds to the presence of @xmath100-singularity at the junction point @xmath35 .",
    "as already mentioned in section [ sec : intro ] , quantum mechanical supersymmetry plays an essential role to generate massive kaluza - klein particles in higher - dimensional field theory .",
    "it has been shown that in 5d gravity _ two _ @xmath1 quantum mechanical susys are needed in order for the `` higgs '' mechanism to generate massive spin-2 particles @xcite",
    ". a crucial ingredient of this coexistence of two quantum mechanical susys is the refactorization of hamiltonians .",
    "thus it would be natural to guess that in a higher - dimensional spin-@xmath3 field theory there would exist a hierarchy of @xmath3 susys in the 4d mass spectrum , whose typical structure must be as follows :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in the previous section , we have not discussed boundary conditions compatible with @xmath3 susys . in this section",
    "we will investigate whether it is possible to construct a hierarchical susy without conflicting with the hermiticity of each hamiltonian .",
    "in the subsequent subsections we will study this hierarchical susy on an interval and on a circle separately .",
    "let us first study a hierarchical susy on an interval .",
    "as a first step let us consider the boundary conditions consistent with 2 susys . inserting the supersymmetric relations @xmath101 and @xmath102 into the equation we have    @xmath103    where the third equation follows from eq . with the identity @xmath104 .",
    "now it is obvious that there is no possible boundary conditions independent of @xmath26 except for the choice @xmath105 .",
    "thus the boundary conditions consistent with 2 susys are uniquely determined as follows :    @xmath106    it is easy to show that there is no possible boundary conditions consistent with a hierarchy of @xmath3 susys for @xmath107 .",
    "thus , we conclude that , at most , three successive quantum mechanical systems on an interval can be supersymmetric in a hierarchy of qm susys .",
    "let us next study a hierarchical susy on a circle .",
    "as mentioned before in this paper we focus on finite superpotentials on the whole domain . when @xmath15 is finite , the finite @xmath108-th superpotential @xmath109 is recursively defined as @xmath110 ,      \\quad\\text{for}\\quad      n=0,1,2,\\cdots , \\label{eq:4.2.1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath111^{-1}. \\label{eq:4.2.2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "since the hierarchy of @xmath3 susys is just the assembly of @xmath1 susys , the boundary conditions in @xmath112@xmath113 sector have to be of the form    @xmath114    with @xmath115 for the sake of concreteness of the discussion , let us first consider 2 susys in @xmath24@xmath25@xmath116 sector . the point is whether there exists a well - defined parameter region to be consistent with two different boundary conditions for the wavefunction @xmath117 of the middle hamiltonian system @xmath25 :    @xmath118    which come from eq . for @xmath119 , and    @xmath120    which come from eq . for @xmath121 .",
    "first , it is obvious that the parameters @xmath122 and @xmath123 have to be equal to @xmath124 and @xmath125 , respectively : @xmath126 next , by adding eqs . and",
    "@xmath127 from which we find @xmath128 where the last equality follows from eq .. thus in order to implement the two boundary conditions the isospectral parameter @xmath129 has to be tuned as @xmath130   - 1 .",
    "\\label{eq:4.2.10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] notice that once the parameters @xmath123 and @xmath129 are tuned as eq . and",
    "eq . , the following identity holds @xmath131 the above procedure can be easily continued to arbitrary @xmath132 .",
    "the resulting boundary conditions are as follows :    @xmath133    where @xmath134 ( @xmath135 ) sign for @xmath136 ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "the isospectral parameters are tuned as @xmath138   - 1 , \\quad n=0,1,2,\\cdots , \\label{eq:4.2.13}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath139 takes a desired value of @xmath140 or @xmath141 ( see fig.[fig:2 ] ) , as it should be .",
    "we thus conclude that starting from any quantum mechanical system on a circle we can systematically construct an infinite hierarchy of qm susys .",
    "we should emphasize the difference between the hierarchy on an interval and on a circle . in the hierarchy on an interval , at most",
    ", three successive quantum mechanical systems can be supersymmetric with the unique boundary conditions @xmath135 .",
    "on the other hand , in the hierarchy on a circle , we can obtain an infinite tower of quantum mechanical systems whose successive two systems form an @xmath142 susy with the boundary conditions and , which are specified by two parameters @xmath143 .     as a function of @xmath144 $ ] , whose range is @xmath145 . ]",
    "in this paper we have clarified the possible boundary conditions in @xmath1 supersymmetric quantum mechanics on a finite domain @xmath2 without conflicting with the conservation of probability current . allowed boundary conditions in @xmath1 supersymmetric quantum mechanics",
    "are limited to the so - called scale - independent subfamily of the @xmath4 family of boundary conditions .",
    "we also studied the hierarchy of @xmath3 susys and showed that in an interval case it is not possible to construct beyond 2 susys . on the other hand , in a circle case",
    "it is possible to construct an infinite hierarchy of supersymmetries by tuning the isospectral parameters @xmath139 .",
    "let us close with some remarks .",
    "1 .   * loop effects of @xmath97*. we show that in @xmath1 supersymmetric quantum mechanics on a circle it is possible to introduce two parameter @xmath99 and @xmath97 into the boundary conditions . as mentioned in section [ sec : bc ] , @xmath99 corresponds to the magnetic flux penetrating through the circle and nonzero @xmath97 corresponds to the presence of the @xmath100-singularity at the junction point @xmath35 . in higher - dimensional gauge theory compactified on a circle",
    "it is widely known that the twisted boundary conditions give rise to gauge symmetry / supersymmetry breaking known as the hosotani / schark - schwarz mechanism .",
    "however , the effect of the presence of @xmath97 is not fully understood yet .",
    "it is interesting to investigate the loop effects of the parameter @xmath97 in five - dimensional gauge theory with a single extra dimension compactified on a circle .",
    "we will address this issue elsewhere .",
    "integrable models*. as opposed to the shape invariant method , the techniques developed in this paper can not be used to solve the schrdinger equation . however , once given a solvable model , it is possible to generate an infinite tower of isospectral solvable models with nontrivial potential energy terms .",
    "* spin-@xmath3 field theory*. in this paper we formulate a systematic description for constructing the hierarchy of @xmath3 susys and show that in an interval case it is not possible to construct beyond 2 susys . since it seems a necessary condition in order to generate massive kaluza - klein particles , one might expect that it is possible to prove some kind of no - go theorem of the `` higgs '' mechanism for spin-@xmath3 ( @xmath146 ) particle in the context of five - dimensional field theory with a single extra dimension compactified on an interval .",
    "however this is an open question .",
    "4 .   * relax to @xmath147-symmetry*. recently , a considerable number of studies have been made on non - hermitian @xmath147-symmetric quantum mechanics ( see for recent review @xcite ) .",
    "it is known that the conventional hermiticity condition on hamiltonian is the sufficient condition for the real and lower bounded spectra and can be replaced by the weaker condition of the @xmath147-symmetry of hamiltonian . in this paper",
    "we impose the hermiticity of hamiltonian , however , it is interesting to relax the hermiticity condition to @xmath147-symmetric one .",
    "but it is not clear to the authors how to treat the @xmath147-symmetry into the boundary conditions .",
    "one of the authors ( so ) would like to thank s. odake for very useful discussions and his hospitality . this work is supported in part by the grant - in - aid for scientific research ( no.18540275 ) by the japanese ministry of education , science , sports and culture",
