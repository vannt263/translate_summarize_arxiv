    "high dimensional testing problems given by @xmath2 hypotheses and corresponding ordered @xmath0-values @xmath3 of the @xmath0-value vector @xmath4 are frequently judged by multiple tests , like step up and step down tests .",

    "the overall control of the error probability of first kind is often too restrictive and leads to very conservative multiple tests .",

    "another branch is the asymptotic fdr control , where milder assumptions like weak dependency may be considered .    in this paper",
    "we will again revisit fdr inequalities for step up and step down tests .",
    "the results depend on three dependence structures for the @xmath0-values , namely the most restrictive basic independence ( bi ) model , the reverse martingale model and the positive regression dependence on a subset ( prds ) model , respectively , which are introduced in section [ basics ] beside the basic notation .",
    "martingale arguments were used in chapter 3 of the dissertation of scheer @xcite for the comparison of the fdr and the expected number of false rejections .",

    "we will point out that finite sample fdr control of adaptive step up tests is a difficult affair and can not be expected in general under dependence .",
    "recall that the well - known storey multiple test does not work under positive regression dependence on the subset of true null hypotheses , see example [ example6 - 1 ] for instance .",
    "we will give a simple condition which ensures asymptotic fdr control under different dependence structures , see theorem [ adaptivecontroltheorem1 ] and [ adaptivecontroltheorem1part2 ] .",
