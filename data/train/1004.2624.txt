    "symmetry is an important feature of many combinatorial search problems . to be able to solve such problems , we often need to take account of symmetry .",
    "for example , when finding magic squares ( prob019 in csplib @xcite ) , we have the symmetries that rotate and reflect the square .",
    "factoring such symmetry out of the search space is often critical when trying to solve large instances of a problem . up till now ,",
    "research on symmetry has mostly focused on symmetries _ between _ different solutions of the same problem . in this paper , we propose considering in addition the internal symmetries ( that is , symmetries _ within _ each solution ) . whilst it appears to be challenging to identify useful internal symmetries ,",
    "such symmetries are easy to exploit .",
    "we simply add constraints that restrict search to those solutions with the required internal symmetry and limit branching to the subset of decisions that generate a complete solution .",
    "we will demonstrate the value of exploiting internal symmetries within solutions with experimental results on two benchmark domains : van der waerden numbers and graceful graphs .",
    "a symmetry @xmath0 is a bijection on assignments . given a set of assignments @xmath1 and a symmetry @xmath0",
    ", we write @xmath2 for @xmath3 .",
    "similarly , given a set of symmetries @xmath4 , we write @xmath5 for @xmath6 .",
    "a special type of symmetry , called _ solution symmetry _ is a symmetry _ between _ the solutions of a problem .",
    "such a symmetry maps solutions onto solutions .",
    "a solution is simply a set of assignments that satisfy every constraint in the problem .",
    "more formally , we say that a problem has the _ solution symmetry _",
    "@xmath0 iff @xmath0 of any solution is itself a solution @xcite . as such mappings are associativity , and the inverse of a solution symmetry and the identity mapping are solution symmetries , the set of solution symmetries @xmath4 of a problem forms a group under composition .",
    "we say that two sets of assignments @xmath1 and @xmath7 are in the same _ symmetry class _ of @xmath4 iff there exists @xmath8 such that @xmath9 .    the _ magic squares _",
    "problem is to label a @xmath10 by @xmath10 square so that the sum of every row , column and diagonal are equal ( prob019 in csplib @xcite ) .",
    "normal _ magic square contains the integers 1 to @xmath11 .",
    "we model this with @xmath11 variables @xmath12 where @xmath13 iff the @xmath14th column and @xmath15th row is labelled with the integer @xmath16 .",
    "`` lo shu '' , the smallest non - trivial normal magic square has been known for over four thousand years and is an important object in ancient chinese mathematics : @xmath17    the magic squares problem has a number of solution symmetries .",
    "for example , consider the symmetry @xmath18 that reflects a solution in the leading diagonal . this map `` lo shu '' onto a symmetric solution : @xmath19 any other rotation or reflection of the square maps one solution onto another .",
    "the 8 symmetries of the square are thus all solution symmetries of this problem .",
    "in fact , there are only 8 different magic square of order 3 , and all are in the same symmetry class .",
    "one way to factor solution symmetry out of the search space is to post symmetry breaking constraints .",
    "see , for instance , @xcite .",
    "for example , we can eliminate @xmath18 by posting a constraint which ensures that the top left corner is smaller than its symmetry , the bottom right corner .",
    "this selects ( [ loshu ] ) and eliminates ( [ loshu2 ] ) .",
    "symmetries can also be found within individual solutions of a constraint satisfaction problem .",
    "we say that a solution @xmath1 _ contains _ the internal symmetry @xmath0 ( or equivalently @xmath0 is a internal symmetry _ within _ this solution ) iff @xmath20 .",
    "consider again `` lo shu '' .",
    "this contains an internal symmetry . to see this , consider the solution symmetry @xmath21 that inverts labels , mapping @xmath16 onto @xmath22",
    "this solution symmetry maps `` lo shu '' onto a different ( but symmetric ) solution .",
    "however , if we now apply the solution symmetry @xmath23 that rotates the square @xmath24 , we map back onto the original solution : @xmath25    consider the composition of these two symmetries : @xmath26 . as this symmetry maps `` lo shu '' onto itself , the solution `` lo shu '' contains the internal symmetry @xmath26 .",
    "one significant difference between a solution symmetry and an internal symmetry is that a solution symmetry is a property of every solution whilst an internal symmetry is a property of just the given solution .",
    "consider the following magic square : @xmath27 @xmath26 is _ not _ an internal symmetry contained within this solution : @xmath28    however , @xmath26 is an internal symmetry found within the following solution : @xmath29 thus we can conclude that @xmath26 is an internal symmetry contained within some but not all solutions of the normal magic squares problem .",
    "in fact , 48 out of the 880 distinct normal magic squares of order 4 contain this internal symmetry . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath26 is a solution symmetry of normal magic square problems of every size .",
    "a solution containing an internal symmetry can often be described by a subset of assignments and one or more symmetries acting on this subset that generate a complete set of assignments .",
    "given a set of symmetries @xmath4 , we write @xmath30 for the closure of @xmath4 . that is , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 . given a solution @xmath1 , we say the subset @xmath7 of @xmath1 and the symmetries @xmath4 _ generate _",
    "iff @xmath34 . in this case",
    ", we also describe @xmath1 as containing the internal symmetries @xmath4 .",
    "consider again the solution ( [ ms ] ) which contains the internal symmetry @xmath26 .",
    "half this magic square and @xmath26 generate the whole solution :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "several forms of symmetry have been identified and exploited in search . for instance , brown , finkelstein and purdom defined symmetry as a permutation of the variables leaving the set of solutions invariant @xcite .",
    "this is a subset of the solution symmetries . for the propositional calculus ,",
    "krishnamurthy was one of the first to exploit symmetry @xcite .",
    "he defined symmetry as a permutation of the variables leaving the set of clauses unchanged .",
    "benhamou and sais extended this to a permutation of the literals preserving the set of clauses @xcite .",
    "perhaps closest to this work is puget s symmetry breaking method that considers symmetries which stabilize the current partial set of assignments @xcite . by comparison , we consider only those symmetries which stabilize a complete set of assignments .",
    "we have defined the concept of an internal symmetry within a single solution of a constraint satisfaction problem . we compared this with the existing notion of symmetry between different solutions of the same problem .",
    "we demonstrated that we can exploit both types of symmetry when solving constraint satisfaction problems .",
    "we illustrated the potential of exploiting internal symmetry on two benchmark domains : van der waerden numbers and graceful graphs . by identifying internal symmetries",
    ", we were able to extend the state of the art in both cases . with van der waerden numbers , we improved two lower bounds by around 10% . with graceful graphs",
    ", we more than doubled the size of the largest known double wheel graph with a graceful labelling .",
