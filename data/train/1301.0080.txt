    "in order to satisfy the ever - increasing wireless data rate requirements and to enable high quality and highly diversified wireless services , wireless research never stops to search new discoveries and development in ideas , technologies , systems and everything available .",
    "more and more available wireless resources are introduced into wireless systems .",
    "the scope of wireless designs has been extended to be multi - dimensional such as temporal , frequency , spatial even coding . as a gift",
    "the multi - dimensional wireless resources bring new challenges into wireless system designs . to order to realize the promised performance gains coming from these resources , some corresponding new technologies need to be adopted , such as multiple - carrier technology , multiple - antenna technology and so on .    referring to the spatial resource , multiple - input multiple - output",
    "( mimo ) technology is a great success in both theoretical research and industrial productions @xcite . along with the evolvement of wireless systems",
    ", mimo becomes to be a fundamental and important ingredient of complicated wireless systems e.g. , cooperative communications , cognitive communications , physical layer security communications , network coding based communications and so on .",
    "although mimo technology has promised great potentials in diversity and multiplexing gains , a complicated transmit / receive beamforming or transceiver design is usually needed @xcite .",
    "different from the simple single antenna case , for mimo transmissions the resources should be carefully allocated across spatial domain according to available channel state information ( csi ) at transmitter or receiver or both @xcite .    for mimo transceiver designs ,",
    "there are various performance metrics such as capacity , bit error rate ( ber ) , mean - square - error ( mse ) and so on .",
    "different performances represent the different preferences of the wireless designers .",
    "meanwhile , because of a variety of wireless service requirements and wireless environments , different wireless systems have totally different network architectures and wireless interfaces . in the resulting transceiver designs , all of these facts are reflected on the constraints and the variables involved in the considered optimization problems . in other words , for different wireless systems the transceiver design problems have different signal models , different power constraints , different numbers of variables and even different performance criteria . as a result transceiver designs",
    "must be investigated case by case . from the theoretical research perspective",
    ", the theorists and researchers would like to find a unified design which can reveal some common nature of the transceiver designs .",
    "to the best our knowledge , up to date the transceiver designs have not been unified for both different performance metrics and different systems .",
    "although the transceiver designs with different performance metrics for different systems are totally different , the work on unifying transceiver designs never stops .    in the existing work for unified linear mimo transceiver designs ,",
    "the widely used logic is for a given wireless system linear transceiver designs with different performance metrics are unified into one kind of optimization problem @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that there are two guidelines for linear mimo transceiver designs , i.e. , using majorization theory @xcite and weighting operation @xcite . for the majorization theory",
    "based guideline , the transceiver design logic is to formulate different performance metrics as different functions of the diagonal elements of the data detection mse matrix at the destination",
    ". then the objective functions are classified into schur - convex or schur - concave functions .",
    "relying on the fundamental properties of schur - convex / concave functions , the optimal solutions can be derived . on the other hand , using weighting operations , the different performance metrics are optimized by solving a weighted mse minimization problem with different weighting matrices .    in this paper , in contrast to the existing work we give a unified transceiver design which aims at unifying the linear transceiver designs for different wireless systems with the same performance metric named as minimum mean - square - error ( mmse ) .",
    "it can be revealed that for the beamforming designs in different wireless systems such as multi - cell coordinated beamforming design , multi - user mimo beamforming design , cognitive mimo beamforming design , amplify - and - forward mimo relaying beamforming design and their corresponding robust transceiver designs with randomly distributed channel estimation errors and so on , the transceiver design problems can always be solved by iteratively solving a series of matrix quadratic programming ( qmp ) problems that can be efficiently solved .    it is true that our work focuses on iterative linear minimum mean - square - error ( lmmse ) transceiver designs which may not be the optimal strategy .",
    "this kind of transceiver design suffers from some well - know weaknesses coming from the mmse objective or iterative design procedure itself or both .",
    "we want to highlight that iterative lmmse designs still have several attractive properties to make them much powerful in engineering applications , as they can be applied to a wide range of fields .",
    "furthermore , they can give a solution with satisfactory performance and they can also act as a benchmark for other kinds of suboptimal schemes .",
    "wireless systems change very fast e.g. , from a point - to - point system to cognitive radio networks or cooperative networks . although we can describe some about what the future wireless systems is like to be , unfortunately we never know what they are exactly .",
    "however , the authors believe that there is definitely something that will not change .",
    "quadratic forms which widely exist are most likely to be kept in transceiver designs because most energy related problems will have quadratic forms . inspired by this fact ,",
    "the framework proposed in this paper may work as the first shot which we can do for the coming wireless systems .",
    "we also want to highlight that although only transceiver design is investigated in our work , there exist several closely related research topics such as training design in channel estimation procedure @xcite or signal reduction in sensor networks @xcite . taking signal reduction @xcite as an example , it is exactly the forwarding matrix design for amplify - and - forward ( af ) mimo relaying systems @xcite .",
    "in addition it is well - known that training design and transceiver design have the same nature .",
    "then it is not surprising that the solution proposed in this paper can also be applied to such kind of closely related topics . by the way ,",
    "the main difference between this paper and its conference version @xcite is that the detailed explanations , justifications and discussions are given at various points of the paper .",
    "in addition , the important numerical simulations are given in this journal version .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sect_2 ] , an interesting understanding of the transceiver designs from optimization theory is presented and it shows the evolvement of transceiver designs is just the same as the procedure to make the optimization problems more complicated . in section  [ sect_3 ] , a concrete example of linear transceiver design is first given which shows the motivation for iterative algorithms .",
    "meanwhile , the quadratic nature of lmmse transceiver design is also revealed . how to exploit the quadratic nature",
    "is investigated in section  [ sect_4 ] and the framework on qmp is discussed as well .",
    "in addition , the applications are specified .",
    "after that , an extension on robust designs is considered in section  [ sect_5 ] .",
    "the numerical results is finally presented in section  [ sect_6 ] .",
    "* notations : * the following notations are used throughout this paper .",
    "boldface lowercase letters denote vectors , while boldface uppercase letters denote matrices .",
    "the notations @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote the transpose , conjugate and conjugate transpose of the matrix @xmath3 , respectively and @xmath4 is the trace of the matrix @xmath3 .",
    "the symbol @xmath5 denotes an @xmath6 identity matrix , while @xmath7 denotes an @xmath8 all zero matrix .",
    "the notation @xmath9 is the hermitian square root of the positive semi - definite matrix @xmath3 , such that @xmath10 and @xmath9 is also a hermitian matrix .",
    "the symbol @xmath11 denotes statistical expectation operation .",
    "the operation @xmath12 stacks the columns of the matrix @xmath3 into a single vector .",
    "the symbol @xmath13 represents kronecker product .",
    "at the beginning , we would like to discuss why our attention is concentrated on linear minimum mean - square - error ( lmmse ) transceiver designs in this paper .",
    "however for ceratin performance metrics such as bit error rate ( ber ) the performance of linear transceivers may be not as good as that of the nonlinear counterparts , linear transceivers are still preferred by practical wireless systems due to their low complexity . on the other hand ,",
    "mean - square - error ( mse ) is a widely used performance metric for estimation , detection and optimization algorithm designs in wireless systems .",
    "it should be pointed out that mse acting as performance metric suffers from several inherent drawbacks as it is not the ultimate performance metric e.g. , capacity and ber . roughly speaking",
    ", mse can be seen as an approximation of the ultimate performance metrics , although they have very close relationships and particularly in some special cases , they are even equivalent with each other . the tractability is the main advantage of mse . for several ultimate performance metrics , their formulations may be too complicated to optimize . for engineers ,",
    "the case where there is a solution is much better than that there is no solution .    from the perspective of optimization theory ,",
    "the lmmse transceiver designs are in nature some specific optimization problems under different constraints . in general , there are two kinds of variables involved in the optimization problems , i.e. , precoder / beamforming matrices and equalizer matrices .",
    "the main difference between them is that the equalizers are usually unconstrained . while for precoder / beamforming , the story is different as there are always various kinds of constraints on the transmitters .",
    "the simplest mimo communication system is the single user point - to - point mimo system with only one power constraint .",
    "the signal model is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the received signal at the receiver and @xmath16 is the channel matrix between the transmitter and receiver .",
    "the symbol @xmath17 denotes the precoder matrix at the source , @xmath18 is the transmitted signal and @xmath19 is the additive noise at the receiver . the corresponding lmmse transceiver design problem is formulated as @xmath20where @xmath21 is the equalizer matrix at the receiver and @xmath22 represents the maximum transmit power at the transmitter . in the following ,",
    "we try to understand transceiver designs for various wireless systems evolving from the previous one for the point - to - point mimo systems .",
    "there are only two possible directions to make the transceiver design problem ( [ ptop ] ) more complicated , i.e. , enlarging the set of variables or enlarging the sect of constraints .",
    "when there are more than one constraint , these constraints can be homogeneous or not ( have the same physical meaning or not ) .",
    "as previously discussed , the constraints are always related to transmitters .",
    "if the constraints are homogeneous , it means that there may exist many transmitters in the considered wireless system , such as multi - user mimo ( mu - mimo ) uplink . in this case the constraints are described as the second order term of the matrices variables is smaller than a threshold . of course , the involved constraints can be inhomogeneous .",
    "for example , in the cognitive radio , there are usually two kinds of constraints .",
    "one is the power constraints and the other is interference constraints . in the latter one ,",
    "the second order term of the matrices variables is also smaller than a threshold .",
    "different from power constraints it describes that the caused interference in a certain direction must be lower than a threshold . in the following ,",
    "we refer to the previous kind of constraints with second term smaller than a threshold as positive constraints .",
    "an interesting question is what about the constraint for which the quadratic term is larger than a threshold .",
    "it means in a certain direction the energy should be larger than a threshold . in a long time",
    ", there is no such kind of wireless systems .",
    "recently , energy harvesting communications give a very important application of this case @xcite . in an energy harvesting communication , except a traditional receiver , there also exists an energy harvesting receiver which aims at harvesting the energy emitted by the transmitter to charge its own battery . as a result",
    ", the transmitter should guarantee the energy harvested by the energy harvesting receiver is larger than a threshold .",
    "similar to the case of cognitive radio , in the following we refer to this class of constraints with second term larger than a threshold as negative constraints .    in conclusion ,",
    "different mathematical formulations of the constraints represent different communication system setups . in the following , we list several concrete and representative examples to illustrate the relationships between various advanced wireless systems and the simplest point - to - point mimo system .",
    "in particular , we want to show how to change of the optimization problem ( [ ptop ] ) to become the corresponding optimization problem for an advanced wireless system .",
    "* case 1 : * when only the number of unconstrained variables increases , it corresponds to mu - mimo downlink transceiver designs @xcite . in the following",

    "the physical meaning of the second constraint is in the information transmission , the source node wants to charge the energy harvesting node as well .",
    "it should be pointed out that the main difference between cases 4 and 5 is that the increased constraint is negative or positive .",

    ", the story can continue and we will have case 7 , case 8 and so on . for engineers ,",
    "physical meaning is more important than mathematics itself .",
    "however , as engineering problems must be perceptible in mathematics here based on these examples we can say that physical meanings can not be independent of mathematics which can help us to predict what the future communication systems would like to be .    in the following",

    "<S> in this paper , a unified linear minimum mean - square - error ( lmmse ) transceiver design framework is investigated , which is suitable for a wide range of wireless systems . </S>",
    "<S> the unified design is based on an elegant and powerful mathematical programming technology termed as quadratic matrix programming ( qmp ) . </S>",
    "<S> based on qmp it can be observed that for different wireless systems , there are certain common characteristics which can be exploited to design lmmse transceivers e.g. , the quadratic forms . </S>",
    "<S> it is also discovered that evolving from a point - to - point mimo system to various advanced wireless systems such as multi - cell coordinated systems , multi - user mimo systems , mimo cognitive radio systems , amplify - and - forward mimo relaying systems and so on , the quadratic nature is always kept and the lmmse transceiver designs can always be carried out via iteratively solving a number of qmp problems . a comprehensive framework on how to solve qmp problems </S>",
    "<S> is also given . </S>",
    "<S> the work presented in this paper is likely to be the first shot for the transceiver design for the future ever - changing wireless systems .    </S>",
