    "the x - ray pulsar  is the most enigmatic of all binary x - ray pulsars .",

    "( hereafter , the bandpass of flux measurement is 26 kev , if not specified . )",
    "it showed the fastest spinup among the binary x - ray pulsars with a mean rate of @xmath9 yr@xmath1 ( elsner et al .",
    "1985 ) . in the early 1980 s ,",
    "the source entered into a low state .",
    "exosat observations in 1983 failed to detect the source and set an upper limit of 0.5 mcrab ( mcclintock & leventhal 1989 and references therein ) .",
    "ginga detected  in 1987 at a flux level of 2  mcrab and the source was found to be spinning down ( makishima et al .",
    "subsequent ginga and hexe observations showed that the spindown rate was remarkably constant at @xmath10 yr@xmath1 in spite of a gradual increase by an order of magnitude in the x - ray flux ( sakao et al .",
    "1990 ; mony et al .",
    "the clear contrast of  in the 1970 s and in the 1980 s indicates the close connection between the high / low transition in luminosity and the spin reversal .",
    "the spindown rate was observed to decrease a little in 1990 and 1991 , although subsequently a linear trend of spindown was recovered with a slightly increased rate ( mandrou et al .",
    "a large flare in the hard x - ray band was detected by cgro in 1993 september ( staubert et al .",
    "1995).and the source brightened up to @xmath1180  mcrab ( 40100  kev ) for a few weeks .",
    "a gradual increase of the spindown rate had been observed for about 6 months before the flare ( finger et al .",
    "1993 ) , but the rate was constant during the flare at @xmath12 yr@xmath1 ( staubert et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the spin period history of  has been almost continuously monitored by batse since 1991 ( chakrabarty et al .",
    "it revealed a short episode of spinup in 1994 ( chakrabarty et al .",
    "1994 ) , which was accompanied by a large increase in the hard x - ray flux .",
    "the 20100 kev phase - averaged pulsed flux reached @xmath11100  mcrab in 1994 november .",
    "the spinup phase was terminated in 1995 march ( chakrabarty et al .",
    "1995 ) and the spindown resumed at a rate of @xmath13 yr@xmath1 .",
    "the origin of this enigmatic behavior in  is not yet understood .",
    "even the basic parameters of the system , such as the orbital period and the surface magnetic field of the neutron star , are not known . a binary period of 304  day was suggested by cutler et al .",
    "( 1986 ) based on the fluctuation of the spinup rate .",
    "however , optical monitoring of the h@xmath14 emission line indicates that the period may be significantly greater than 304  days ( sood et al .",
    "if the spin behavior is analyzed in the framework of the accretion torque model by ghosh and lamb ( 1979a , 1979b ) and wang ( 1987 ) , a very large magnetic field on the neutron star surface , @xmath15  g , is required ( makishima et al .  1988 ) .",
    "dotani et al .",
    "( 1989 ) showed that even a moderate magnetic field of a few @xmath16  g can explain the spindown rate , if a retrograde accretion disk were formed around the neutron star .",
    "an energy - dependent pulse profile in hard x - rays is used to construct a model based on two - photon emission as the dominant continuum source ( greenhill et al .",
    "the retrograde disk model is supported by the batse observations ( nelson et al .",
    "1997 ) , although some other possibilities such as the transition between keplerian flow and advective flow in accretion geometry are also suggested ( yi , wheeler & vishniac 1997 ) .    in this paper we report results obtained from the unpublished ginga and new asca data .",
    "the data we analyzed in this paper were obtained with ginga ( makino & the astro - c team 1987 ) and asca ( tanaka et al .",
    "the main instruments aboard ginga are the large area counters ( lac ; turner et al.1989 ) , which are non - imaging , conventional proportional counters .",
    "the lac has an effective area of 4000  @xmath17 and covers an energy range of 137  kev or 260  kev depending on the high voltage setting it has the relatively poor energy resolution of @xmath1118  % at 6  kev .",
    "the field of view of the lac is restricted by collimators to @xmath18 ( fwhm ) .",
    "ginga observations of  were made on 5 occasions .",
    "the first 3 sets of data were already analyzed and the results were previously published ( makishima et al .  1988 ; dotani et al .",
    "1989 ; sakao et al.1990 ) .",
    "we used the 4th and 5th sets of data for the present analysis .",
    "the fourth observations were carried out on 1990 september 45 , as a part of galactic ridge observations , and the 5th ones were on 1991 september 16 . in the 5th observation ,",
    "the high voltage setting of the lac was changed to cover 260  kev , while in the 4th observation the nominal setting of 137 kev was adopted . both sets of data",
    "were acquired in mpc1 mode with 48 energy channels . in this data mode",
    "the temporal resolution was 0.5 , 4 , and 16  s for high , medium , and low bit rate , respectively .",
    "unfortunately , most of the 5th observation was recorded in low bit rate mode , and this limited the temporal resolution in later analysis .",
    "asca carries four identical grazing - incidence x - ray telescopes ( xrt ) , and each xrt has an imaging spectrometer at its focal plane .",
    "the xrt utilize nested thin - foil conical reflectors to achieve large effective area ( 1200  @xmath17 at 1  kev ; serlemitsos et al .",
    "a point source image has a typical size of @xmath19 in half power diameter .",
    "the focal plane detectors are two solid - state spectrometers ( sis ; burke et al.1994 ) and two gas imaging spectrometers ( gis ; makishima et al .",
    "the sis consists of 4 ccd chips optimized for x - ray photon detection .",
    "it covers an energy range of 0.510  kev and a single chip covers a @xmath20 sky field .",
    "the sis achieves high energy resolution of 2  % ( fwhm ) at 6  kev .",
    "the gis is a gas scintillation proportional counter with imaging capability .",
    "it covers an energy range of 0.710  kev and the field of view of @xmath21 in radius .",
    "the gis has an energy resolution of 7.8  % ( fwhm ) and a spatial resolution of 0.5  mm ( fwhm ) both at 6  kev .",
    "asca observations of  were carried out in 1994 september 1415 .",
    "the observation mode of sis was 1-ccd faint mode , and that of gis was ph mode with standard bit assignment .",
    "thus the time resolution of sis was 4 s and that of gis was 62.5 ms and 0.5 s for high and medium bit rate , respectively .",
    "the journal of the observations are summarized in table  1 .",
    "raw data were first screened according to the good time intervals , which exclude south atlantic anomaly passages , earth occultation of the source , and the periods of low cut - off rigidity ( @xmath226 gev / c ) .",
    "light curves of the data were then checked to remove parts of the data contaminated by particle events manually .",
    "these screened data were used for the subsequent analysis .",
    "the pulse period of  was determined using an epoch folding technique .",
    "we did not subtract background from the data , because the timescale of the background variation was much longer than @xmath23  s and did not affect the period determination of .",
    "the pulse period which gives the largest @xmath24 against a constant was searched .",
    "the time resolution of the data was 4  s in the 1990 observation , so we divided the folding pulse period into 28 phase bins .",
    "the time resolution was 16  s in the 1991 observation and we divided the folding period into 7 phase bins .",
    "finer binnings were not appropriate because the pulse period is about @xmath23 s. heliocentric pulse periods we obtained are listed in table  2 .",
    "average rates of pulse period change between the previous measurement and this measurement are also listed in table  2 .",
    "these results indicate that  was spinning down since 1987 .",
    "the folded light curves are shown in figure  1 .",
    "the pulse profile of data set ( a ) is very similar to those in 1988 and 1989 : double peaked in low energy band and single peaked in high energy band accompanied by a sharp and deep dip .",
    "the sharp dip observed in data set ( a ) is not clear in data set ( b ) .",
    "this may be due to the low time resolution of the data .",
    "is located close to the galactic plane , hence it is difficult to accurately estimate the contribution from the galactic ridge emission ( koyama 1989 and the references therein ) .",
    "for this estimation , we sampled the spectra at two points in the sky , ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) = ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) and ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) ; , ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) , is located on the line connecting these two points .",
    "the data were obtained as a part of galactic ridge observations , in which the data of  were also acquired .",
    "these two points are well separated from nearby bright sources such as the kepler snr and gx  9 + 9 , and hence the spectra can be regarded as those of the pure galactic ridge emission .",
    "the spectra were fitted by a model of thermal bremsstrahlung and a gaussian line with a center energy of 6.7  kev - the energy of fe xxv k@xmath33 .",
    "the temperature of the thermal bremsstrahlung was found to be 4.78 kev and 2.14 kev , respectively , and the flux in unit of count rate at spectral peak was @xmath34 counts s@xmath1 kev@xmath1 and 0.95 counts s@xmath1 kev@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the gaussian line was @xmath35 counts s@xmath1 at the former position and not detected at the latter .",
    "the flux of the galactic ridge emission at the position of  was then estimated by linear interpolation of the best - fit parameters .",
    "the resultant temperature and spectral peak flux were 6.1  kev and 3.27 counts s@xmath1 kev@xmath1 , which corresponds to 137 kev flux of 18.1 counts s@xmath1 .",
    "the iron line flux was estimated to be 1.2 counts s@xmath1 .",
    "the ridge emission thus determined was subtracted from the energy spectra of  together with the intrinsic and cosmic x - ray background utilizing the method described in hayashida et al .",
    "the resultant , background - subtracted spectra are shown in figure  2 .",
    "the energy spectrum of the observation in 1991 was well fitted by a power law attenuated by a cold absorber , as was the case in the three previous observations in 1987 , 1988 , and 1989 .",
    "the spectrum of 1990 was , however , better expressed by a partial covering model of a power law continuum .",
    "a prominent iron line was also detected at about 6.4 kev .",
    "this line is considered to be a fluorescence line of neutral or slightly ionized iron in the vicinity of the source , not a collisionally excited emission line of highly ionized iron whose center energy is at 6.7 or 6.9 kev .",
    "the fluorescence line provides important information on the physics of the system ( makishima 1986 ) .",
    "the center energy gives the ionization stage of the illuminated matter and thus the distance of the plasma from the source and the density .",
    "the geometry of the attenuating matter can be derived from the equivalent width of the line and the attenuation column density .",
    "therefore , it is essential to resolve a 6.4 kev line from 6.7 and 6.9 kev lines , and determine the central energy and equivalent width precisely .",
    "unfortunately the 1991 energy spectrum has coarse energy binning and the line center energy could not be determined with enough accuracy to distinguish the 6.4 kev and 6.7 kev lines . as seen later , asca data show that the iron line in  is centered at 6.4 kev .",
    "thus , in the subsequent analysis of ginga spectra , we fixed the line center energy to 6.4 kev .",
    "we summarize in table  3 the best - fit parameters of both sets of observations .",
    "the spectra and the best - fit model are shown in figure  2 .",
    "we detected significant x - ray emission from  up to @xmath1150  kev in data set  2 .",
    "however , we could not find any significant structure of cyclotron resonant scattering in the energy spectrum .",
    "the absorption - corrected x - ray luminosity is calculated as @xmath36 erg s@xmath1 and @xmath37 erg s@xmath1 for 1990 and 1991 , respectively , for the assumed distance of 10 kpc . in 1989 ,",
    "the source was found to be as luminous as @xmath38 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "it was interpreted that  was recovering from the low state ( sakao et al .",
    "1990 ) . in 1991 , however , it decreased again to the very faint level as in 1987 , and was still in the steady spindown phase .",
    "was detected with both gis and sis with an average count rate of about 1 counts s@xmath1 ( gis : 110  kev ) .",
    "no significant time variation was seen except for the 122  s pulsation .",
    "source photons were extracted from the circular region centered on the gis image peak with a radius of 6  arcmin . as for sis , photons from the whole chips ( s0c1 and s1c3 ) were used to get better statistics . both timing and spectral analyses",
    "were done using these source photons .",
    "the pulse period of  was determined using the gis data , which have superior time resolution .",
    "we applied neither detector - background subtraction nor dead time correction to the data , because such corrections are not significant for timing analysis of medium brightness sources such as . using the epoch folding technique",
    ", we found the barycentric pulse period to be @xmath39  s. folded pulse profiles are shown in figure  3 in several different energy bands .",
    "deep dips similar to that observed with ginga are clearly seen in the pulse profile . below 3  kev ,",
    "galactic ridge emission dominates and hence the pulse amplitude is much reduced .",
    "it should be noted that the dip structure in the pulse profile becomes shallow in the energy band between 6.286.52 kev , where the fluorescent iron line is dominant ( see figure  4 ) .",
    "iron line flux contributes about 40 % in this energy band and the reduction of the dip depth ( @xmath1150 % in 6.286.52 kev compared to @xmath1180 % in the other bands ) is consistent with no pulsation in the iron emission line .",
    "this conforms to the scenario that the fluorescent iron line originates from the spherically symmetric absorbing matter as discussed in section  4 .",
    "the other energy bands besides @xmath223  kev and 6.286.52 kev show a similar pulse profile and pulse fraction , indicating no pulse phase dependence of the spectral parameters , such as the photon index or the absorption column density .",
    "we calculated a phase - averaged energy spectra of sis and gis using the source photons described previously .",
    "for the gis spectrum , background photons were extracted using the gis data from the region symmetric to the source region relative to the bore sight axis of the xrt .",
    "these background data include galactic ridge emission .",
    "we constructed an energy spectrum of the galactic ridge emission by subtracting the high latitude background data , which are publically available .",
    "we found that the background spectrum can be well represented by emission from an optically thin hot plasma model by mewe et al .",
    "the best - fit temperature obtained was 6.1  kev with equivalent hydrogen column density of @xmath40 @xmath4 .",
    "because we could not extract background data for sis due to the small fov , we just subtracted the high latitude blank sky data as background .",
    "galactic ridge emission was included in a model spectrum for spectral fitting .",
    "we found that a single power law modified by cold matter absorption plus a narrow emission line can reproduce the energy spectrum .",
    "the model functions we employed are @xmath41 \\exp(-\\sigma n_{\\rm h}^{\\rm circ})\\ ] ] and @xmath42     \\exp(-\\sigma n_{\\rm h}^{\\rm circ})\\ ] ] for the sis and the gis data , respectively . here , @xmath43 is the x - ray energy , @xmath44 the model spectrum by mewe et al . , @xmath45 the photon index , @xmath46 the photo - absorption cross section , @xmath47 the hydrogen equivalent column density , @xmath48 the line center energy , @xmath49 the intrinsic line width , which is assumed to be effectively zero in the fitting , and @xmath50 and @xmath51 flux normalization factors . the model of the galactic ridge emission , @xmath44 ,",
    "is included only in the sis , because it is subtracted from the gis spectrum .",
    "the spectra and the best - fit model are shown in figure  4 , and the best - fit parameters are listed in table  3 .",
    "the luminosity of  in 2 - 20 kev ( same as the ginga band ) is estimated as @xmath52 erg s@xmath1 using the best - fit model for the assumed distance of 10 kpc .    to determine the ionization ( state ) of iron , we fitted the 510 kev sis data with a power law attenuated by the iron k edge plus iron k@xmath33 and k@xmath53 lines .",
    "the line - flux ratio of the iron k@xmath53 to k@xmath33 was fixed to the value expected in fluorescence of fe i. the center - energy ratio of the k@xmath53 to k@xmath33 was also fixed to the value expected in fe i. we tested several values of this ratio , and found that they do not change the result . for sis0 and sis1 , the center energy of the iron k@xmath33 line was fitted to be @xmath54 kev and @xmath55 kev , respectively , and the energy of the iron k edge was fitted to be @xmath56 kev and @xmath57 kev , respectively .",
    "the errors are 90 % confidence intervals .",
    "the line center energies of both sensors were inconsistent with each other .",
    "this is considered to be due to gain - calibration uncertainties of the siss caused by the decreasing charge transfer efficiency ( e.g. , gendreau 1995 ; yamashita et al.1997 ) . for measurement of the ionization degree free from the gain uncertainties , we utilize the ratio of the edge energy to the line center energy .",
    "the ratios were @xmath58 and @xmath59 for sis0 and sis1 , respectively .",
    "it should be noted that these values are consistent with each other within the statistical errors .",
    "thus the averaged energy ratio was accurately determined to be @xmath60 , which corresponds to fe i - fe iv ( lotz 1968 ) .",
    "we searched for a dust scattering halo around .",
    "x - rays from a source near the galactic plane such as  would suffer from scattering by interstellar matter and may produce a halo around the source .",
    "efficiency of the dust scattering is a strong function of x - ray energy and the dust scattering halo is most prominent at lower energies .",
    "to search for the halo , we compared the radial profile of the image above and below 5 kev .",
    "the dividing energy was selected to be as low as possible while retaining statistical significance in the lower energy band .",
    "this method is unaffected by possible attitude fluctuation of the satellite during the observations .",
    "although  is located very close to the direction of the galactic center , the effect of dust scattering was not seen in the image .",
    "this is not surprising , because the source is heavily absorbed and has little x - ray emission in the lower energy band , where the dust scattering is most prominent .",
    "predehl , friedrich , & staubert ( 1995 ) found an x - ray halo around in a rosat - pspc image below 2.4 kev .",
    "the halo extended to a few arcmin and was brighter than .",
    "predehl et al .",
    "suggested that this halo was the reflection of the flare 70 hours before the rosat observation .",
    "that is consistent with our result .",
    "through the ginga and asca observations , we found large changes in the energy spectrum , especially for the absorption column density and the iron emission line . on the other hand ,",
    "the spindown rate decreased slightly in 1990 and 1991 followed by an increased rate , and entered a short episode of spinup in 1994 just after the asca observation .",
    "the spinup episode is recognized as a glitch in 1995 in figure  1 in chakrabarty et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , or a flare beginning at mjd 49638 in figure  2 ibid . in this section",
    ", we consider the possible connection between the circumstellar matter and the spin period change .",
    "hydrogen column densities obtained from the  observations with ginga and asca range between @xmath61 @xmath4 .",
    "these column densities are several orders of magnitude larger than the galactic absorption of @xmath62 @xmath4 ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) , and are considered to have a circumstellar origin .",
    "the equivalent width of the fluorescent iron line is useful to deduce the distribution of the circumstellar matter .",
    "we show in figure  5 a scatter plot of the equivalent width of the iron line and the hydrogen column density obtained from the asca and all the ginga observations .",
    "the relation expected from a spherical distribution of matter is also indicated in the figure .",
    "the column density drastically increased to @xmath63 @xmath4 in 1991 with the increase of iron equivalent width to 3 kev .",
    "this equivalent width is very close to that expected from a spherical distribution of the matter .",
    "the asca observation showed that the column decreased in 1994 to a level comparable to that in 1990 .",
    "when the column density is relatively low , the data points are scattered around the relation expected from the spherical distribution ; but , the deviation is at most factors of a few .",
    "this scatter may be due to a clumpy structure of the circumstellar matter .",
    "in fact , we found that a partial covering model gives a better fit to the energy spectrum in 1990 .",
    "this supports the assumption that the circumstellar matter has a clumpy distribution .",
    "except for this clumpiness , we can consider that the circumstellar matter has a spherical symmetric distribution around .",
    "we found from the asca observation that the ionization degree of iron in the circumstellar matter is very low ( fe i - fe iv ) .",
    "thus , the @xmath64-parameter ( @xmath65 ) , which determines the photo - ionization degree , may be smaller than 30 erg cm s@xmath1 . with the knowledge of @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) , we can estimate the characteristic scale of the attenuating - matter distribution or the typical distance of the matter from the source .",
    "asca data are not very useful to evaluate @xmath66 , because the data cover only below 10 kev . according to balloon experiments ,",
    "the hard x - ray luminosity ( 20100 kev ) was approximately @xmath69 erg s@xmath1 ( for the distance of 10 kpc ) during the 1990 s except for the bright state in 1993 december ( rao et al .",
    "1994 ; paul et al .",
    "therefore , we assume @xmath70 erg s@xmath1 as the total x - ray luminosity during the asca observation .",
    "this x - ray luminosity and the column density of @xmath71 @xmath4 give the radius of the attenuating circumstellar matter to be larger than @xmath72 cm .",
    "thus , it is concluded that the source was enveloped in a spherical gas cloud with a radius of @xmath73 cm .",
    "considering various uncertainties in the above calculation , the result should be regarded as an order of magnitude estimation .",
    "however , it is still larger than the co - rotation radius @xmath74 cm and the alfven radius @xmath75 cm even for the extraordinarily strong magnetic field of @xmath76 g. instead , it may be comparable to the size of the roche lobe , if the binary period is of order a year .",
    "is thought to accrete matter from the slow stellar wind of the companion .",
    "the large size of the circumstellar matter and its nearly spherical distribution around  is naturally interpreted as the dense stellar wind from the companion captured in the roche lobe of .",
    "the temperature of the plasma is estimated as a few ev from the value of the @xmath64-parameter ( @xmath77 erg s@xmath1 cm ) , which corresponds to a thermal velocity of about 30 km s@xmath1 .",
    "on the other hand , the kepler velocity at @xmath78 cm from the neutron star is about 100 km s@xmath1 .",
    "thus the circumstellar matter is considered to be bound to .",
    "it is noteworthy that , if  becomes slightly brighter , the circumstellar matter can easily escape from .",
    "suppose  becomes 3 times more luminous , the @xmath64-parameter of the circumstellar matter would increase up to @xmath23 .",
    "this corresponds to a plasma temperature of @xmath77 ev , and hence a thermal velocity of 100 km s@xmath1 .",
    "this is comparable to the keplerian velocity and the plasma can escape from .    during the spin down phase of  since 1985",
    ", the stellar wind captured by  may be stagnated around the neutron star at a distance of @xmath78 cm or more .",
    "the low luminosity characteristic of the spin down phase would reduce the amount of matter escaping from  by x - ray heating , resulting in a larger column density .",
    "some other effects such as a change of the wind velocity may also have contributed to the increase in column density .",
    "because the amount of the stellar wind captured by the neutron star depends on the wind velocity as @xmath79 , a small change of the wind velocity can result in the large change of the captured mass .",
    "when  spins up , as in 1970 s and in the short episode of 19941995 , the x - ray luminosity is at least several times larger than that in the spindown phase",
    ". the x - ray luminosity may be large enough to heat up the circumstellar matter and to expel much of it from the vicinity of .",
    "this explains the relatively low column density observed during the 1970 s ( becker et al .",
    "1976 ) .    just before the short episode of spinup in 1994 - 1995 ,",
    "the column density was observed with asca to be reduced to the level of 1990 .",
    "this means that most of the accumulated circumstellar matter had been expelled from the vicinity of  before the transition to spinup .",
    "thus it is suspected that the accumulation of the circumstellar matter may not be the cause of the spinup , and is just controlled by the x - ray luminosity .",
    "this may be understood if the matter which affects the spin period change is located near the alfven radius , not at the distance of @xmath78 cm from the neutron star .",
    "optical observation is powerful for plasma diagnosis , and it is important to check whether our interpretation of the x - ray data is consistent with optical data or not . here we briefly describe a preliminary analysis of optical observations , and examine the consistency between the two bands .",
    "we do not discuss in detail as this will be reported in a forthcoming paper by greenhill ( 1998 ) .",
    "v2116 oph , the optical counterpart of gx 1 + 4 , was observed with the 3.9 meter anglo australian telescope and the rgo spectrograph on 1994 september 25 , 11 days after the asca observations .",
    "the measurements covered the wavelength range 3700 to 8900 @xmath80  with a resolution of 3.2 @xmath80 . on september",
    "26 measurements centered on the h@xmath33 wavelength were made with a resolution of 1.0 @xmath80  fwhm .",
    "photometric observations in the v , h@xmath33 and i bands were made with the mount john university observatory 1 meter telescope on five nights ( august 25 and 27 , september 2 , and october 3 and 5 ) covering the time of the asca observations .",
    "the h@xmath33 flux increased slowly during this period and was about 0.4 magnitudes brighter on october 5 . the v ",
    "i color changed only marginally . in view of these relatively small changes",
    "we believe our aat data are representative of conditions in the source during the asca observations .    the measured and de - reddened fluxes of some prominent emission lines are listed in table  4 .",
    "the reddening correction assumes the same interstellar extinction as observed by chakrabarty and roche ( 1997 ) .",
    "the observed h@xmath33 flux ( @xmath81 erg @xmath4 s@xmath1 ) was about half the value observed by davidsen et al .",
    "( 1977 ) during the high state in the mid 1970 s and by chakrabarty & roche ( 1997 ) in 1993",
    ". the measured h@xmath33/h@xmath53 line strength ratio of @xmath1130 was less than 25 % of the ratio measured by davidsen et al.during the high state .",
    "numerous balmer , paschen , he i , o i , o ii , [ o iii ] , na i , ca ii and fe ii lines were seen in emission but higher excitation lines were weak or undetected .",
    "he ii 4686 was weak , the c ii /n iii feature common in x - ray sources at 46404650 @xmath80  was not detected ; nor was the 6830 @xmath80  raman line although this was very strong during the high state and in 1988 ( davidsen et al .",
    "1977 ; chakrabarty & roche , 1997 ) .",
    "the o i 8446 line , an indicator of h@xmath33 optical depth ( netzer & penston 1976 ) was almost an order of magnitude fainter relative to h@xmath33 than during the 1993 measurements by chakrabarty & roche ( 1997 ) .",
    "following chakrabarty & roche ( 1997 ) we assume that the emission lines are excited by photo - electric interactions in circumstellar matter by uv emission from the disk .",
    "further we adopt the hypothesis developed earlier that the matter is trapped in the gravitational field of the neutron star . the h@xmath33 line width ( @xmath112 @xmath80  fwhm after correction for the spectrograph resolution )",
    "is consistent with doppler broadening due to matter gravitationally bound to the neutron star at a radius of @xmath82 cm . as noted by chakrabarty & roche ( 1997 ) the presence of fe ii and absence of fe iii lines implies a temperature in the emission region of @xmath2230,000 k. the ratio of the corrected o i 8446 to h@xmath33 emission",
    "is @xmath110.01 indicating an h@xmath33 optical depth @xmath11150 ( netzer & penston 1976 ) . from this and the corrected line strength ratios of the first 4 balmer lines we find , using the model of drake & ulrich ( 1980 ) , an electron density @xmath83 to @xmath84 @xmath85 and a temperature @xmath1120,000 k in the emission line region .",
    "similar values for the electron density and plasma temperature are obtained from the ratios of the he i ( 5876 , 6678 and 7065 @xmath80 ) emission lines ( proga et al .",
    "these values are consistent with the hydrogen equivalent column density @xmath86 @xmath4 and plasma temperature derived from the asca spectroscopy assuming a spherical distribution of matter with a radius of @xmath87 cm about the source .",
    "the densities are one to two orders of magnitude greater than those estimated by davidsen et al .",
    "( 1977 ) and by chakrabarty & roche ( 1997 ) and the radius is an order of magnitude smaller .",
    "thus it is shown that the parameters of the system derived from the x - ray data , assuming a spherical distribution of circumstellar matter coincide with those of the optically emitting plasma .    since the separation of the neutron star and its giant companion",
    "is expected to be greater than 1 au ( @xmath88 cm ) the matter in our model can be bound to the neutron star",
    ". clearly , in the davidsen et al .  ( 1977 ) model the emission region surrounds the whole binary system .",
    "the ginga and asca observations suggest that gas is accumulated in the vicinity of the source , probably by the stellar wind from the companion star , and may be blown off by an increase in x - ray luminosity . if the accreting matter is supplied from the stellar wind as suggested ( e.g. , dotani et al .",
    "1989 ; davidsen et al .",
    "1977 ) , even a small increase in x - ray luminosity would lead to a decrease in accretion .",
    "this constitutes a negative feedback process and suppresses the x - ray luminosity .",
    "the situation is similar to the self - regulation of the luminosity at the eddington limit",
    ".  entered a low state in the early 1980 s , and , except for occasional short flares ( chakrabarty et al.1997 ) , remained faint until the asca observation in 1994 . during the spindown phase",
    ", the activity may be suppressed to a low level by the negative feedback mechanism .",
    "the condition for the mechanism to work is rather difficult to satisfy compared to eddington accretion : ( 1 ) the @xmath64-parameter of the accretion flow needs to be high enough so that the thermal velocity can exceed the escape velocity . in the case of ,",
    "the relatively low density of the accumulated matter , @xmath89 @xmath84 @xmath85 in 1991 , resulted in a large @xmath64-parameter . on the other hand , in binaries where the accretion matter is supplied by roche - lobe overflow , the density @xmath90 @xmath85 is presumably too high for the mechanism to work .",
    "( 2 ) the flow velocity must be lower than the thermal velocity attainable through x - ray heating .",
    "if the ram pressure of the flow is higher than the thermal pressure , trapped matter will not be blown off by x - ray heating .",
    "the typical wind velocity of m giants is 10 - 30 km s@xmath1 and it is comparable or smaller than the thermal velocity of a plasma of @xmath91 . when  is in a flare state and @xmath92 , the thermal velocity exceeds the wind velocity . in the case of massive binaries with early type companion stars such as cen x-3 or vela x-1 ,",
    "the wind is supersonic and the negative feedback mechanism is not likely to work , even if the sources are wind fed .",
    "chakrabarty , van kerkwijk , & larkin ( 1998 ) reported that the wind velocity of  is as large as @xmath93 km s@xmath1 .",
    "chakrabarty et al .",
    "suggested that radiation from the accretion disk or the neutron star may contribute to the acceleration of the outflow .",
    "that is consistent with the picture of the negative feedback , which predicts an outflow of circumstellar matter heated by the source .",
    "however , if the initial velocity of the stellar wind were as large as 250 km s@xmath1 , our model would fail .",
    "it should be noted that this negative feedback will not keep the x - ray luminosity constant .",
    "the x - ray source blows off only matter located far from the source with small gravitational binding energy .",
    "therefore , the fuel supply decreases after a certain time comparable to the orbital period . assuming the central mass to be 1.4 m@xmath94 , the orbital period is estimated to be @xmath23 days at the distance of @xmath78 cm .",
    "such a negative feedback with a time delay would result in temporal variability such as oscillations or limit cycles .",
    "this mechanism predicts that ; large x - ray flares can not last long because they even blow off matter close to the source , and that ; small flares or weak activities last longer .",
    "that is qualitatively consistent with the pulsed flux history reported by chakrabarty et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "our interpretation of the variability in the luminosity and the absorbing column density through the negative feedback mechanism explains the very steady spindown trend .",
    "the mass supply , averaged over a time longer than the feedback timescale , would not change very much even if the mass loss rate of the companion changes considerably .",
    "either the retrograde disk or a propeller effect processes can spindown the neutron star steadily under the feedback mechanism .    in the spinup phase during the 1970 s and in 1994 , the feedback mechanism obviously did not work . in the 1970 s ,",
    "the luminosity was typically as high as @xmath95 erg s@xmath1 and was enough to blow off a stellar wind with a velocity of 10 km s@xmath1 and a density of @xmath96 @xmath85 .",
    "the wind could not reach the surface of the neutron star unless it was as dense as @xmath97 @xmath85 . to avoid blow off , the accreting matter had to be supplied by a very dense stellar wind or by a roche - lobe overflow .",
    "the condition of transition between spindown and spinup phases is not understood yet .",
    "since the companion is a low mass star , x - ray irradiation of the surface may affect the thermal structure and the evolution ( e.g. , podsiadlowski 1991 ; dantona & ergma 1993 ) .",
    "harpaz & rappaport ( 1994 ) show that such a star may repeat short episodes ( 1 - 100 yr ) of mass transfer .",
    "it is possible that the spinup and spindown phases of  are part of the episodic mass transfers induced by x - ray irradiation .",
    "gx  1 + 4 in spindown phase was observed with ginga in 1990 and 1991 , and with asca in 1994 , a month before the transition to a short spinup episode .",
    "the behavior of the source in 1990 and 1991 can be summarized as below :    * it was found that the absorption column density drastically increased to @xmath98 @xmath4 in 1991 , indicating a rapid accumulation of matter in the vicinity of the source . *",
    "the luminosity decreased to @xmath99 erg s@xmath1 in 1990 , and to @xmath100 erg s@xmath1 in 1991 , which is almost the same level as the lowest activity in 1987 . nevertheless , the spindown rate was very stable at @xmath101 s s@xmath1 during the time .",
    "* the absorption column density decreased to @xmath102 @xmath4 in 1994 after a long interval in a high absorption phase . * the ionization stage of iron in the absorbing matter was derived to be fe i  fe iv from the ratio of the absorption - edge energy to the emission - line energy .",
    "* the @xmath64-parameter of the absorbing matter was 30 , consistent with a spherical distribution with a radius of @xmath103 cm about the source . *",
    "the luminosity brightened to @xmath104 erg s@xmath1 , which is the brightest in the spindown phase , and almost comparable to that in the highly - active spinup phase .",
    "the picture of  in a gas cloud is also supported by the optical observations covering the asca observation .",
    "the doppler broadening of the h@xmath33 line was consistent with the kepler motion at @xmath105 cm from a neutron star , and electron density and temperature estimated from the line strength ratios were consistent with the values expected from the picture .",
    "to explain the accumulation and the disappearance of the absorbing matter , a negative feedback mechanism stabilizing the spindown rate is suggested .",
    "gas supplied by a slow stellar wind from the companion star would be blown off , if the luminosity of the neutron star is high .",
    "when the luminosity is low , the neutron star would accrete and increase the luminosity .",
    "therefore , the accretion rate and thus the spindown rate may be stabilized under a certain level .",
    "this mechanism does not depend on the nature of the unknown spindown mechanism , for which a retrograde disk and high magnetic field were proposed .",
