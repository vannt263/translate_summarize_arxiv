    "in fact any finite metric space is trivially induced by one such graph .",
    "we also study the metric spaces induced by unweighted connected graphs , where the shortest path is simply the least number of steps between two vertices .",
    "while the definition of lines is more natural than that of the closure lines , it was noted that the sylvester - gallai theorem no longer holds in arbitrary metric spaces with the lines thus defined , but it holds in a sense with the closure lines :    [ thm.sylvester_chvatal ] ( @xcite ) in any metric space , either there is a universal closure line consisting of all the points , or else there is a closure line of size 2 .    for the de bruijn - erds theorem ,",
