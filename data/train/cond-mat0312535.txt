    "many measures  including total number of passengers , total number of flights , or total amount of cargo  quantifying the importance of the world airports are compiled and publicized  @xcite .",
    "we study here the _ oag max _ database , which comprises flight schedule data of more than 800 of the world s airlines for the period november 1 , 2000 to october 31 , 2001 .",
    "this database is compiled by oag , a division of reed business information group , and includes all scheduled flights and scheduled charter flights , both for big aircrafts  air carriers  and small aircrafts  air taxis .",
    "we focus our analysis on a network of cities , not of airports  for example , the newark , jfk and la guardia airports are all assigned to new york city .",
    "we further restrict our analysis to _ passenger flights _ operating in the time period november 1 , 2000 to november 7 , 2000 . even though this data is more than four years old",
    ", the resulting world - wide airport network is virtually indistinguishable from the network one would obtain if using data collected today .",
    "the reason is that air traffic patterns are strongly correlated with : ( i ) socio - economic factors , such as population density and economic development ; and ( ii ) geo - political factors such as the distribution of the continents over the surface of the earth and the locations of borders between states @xcite .",
    "clearly , the time scales associated to changes in these factors are much longer than the lag in the data we analyze here .    during the period considered ,",
    "there are 531,574 unique non - stop passenger flights , or flight segments , operating between 3883 distinct cities .",
    "we identify 27,051 distinct city pairs having non - stop connections . the fact that the database is highly redundant  that is , that most connections between pairs of cities are represented by more than one flight",
    " adds reliability to our analysis .",
    "specifically , the fact that unscheduled flights are not considered does not mean , in general , that the corresponding link between a certain pair of cities is missing in the network , since analogous scheduled flights may still operate between them .",
    "similarly , even if some airlines have canceled their flights between a pair of cities since november 2000 , it is highly unlikely that all of them have .",
    "we create the corresponding adjacency matrix for this network , which turns out to be almost symmetrical .",
    "the very minor asymmetry stems from the fact that a small number of flights follow a `` circular '' pattern , i.e , a flight might go from a to b to c , and back to a. to simplify the analysis , we symmetrize the adjacency matrix .    further , we build regional networks for different geographic regions ( table  [ t - regions ] ) . specifically ,",
    "we generate twenty - one regional networks at different aggregation levels . at the highest - aggregation level , we generate six networks ; one each for africa , asia and middle east , europe , latin america , north america , and oceania . for each of these regions , except for north america and oceania",
    ", we generate between two and five sub - networks .",
    "for instance , the asia and middle east network is further subdivided into south asia , central asia , southeast asia , northeast asia , and middle east .",
    "a ubiquitous characteristic of complex networks is the so - called `` small - world '' property @xcite . in a small - world network ,",
    "pairs of nodes are connected by short paths as one expects for a random graph @xcite .",
    "crucially , nodes in small - world networks also have a high - degree of cliquishness , as one finds in low - dimensional lattices but not in random graphs .    in the air transportation network ,",
    "the average shortest path length @xmath0 is the average minimum number of flights that one needs to take to get from any city to any other city in the world .",
    "we find that for the @xmath1 cities in the asia and middle east network @xmath2 , and that the average shortest path length between the @xmath3 cities in the giant component of the world - wide network is only about one step greater , @xmath4 . actually , most pairs of cities ( 56% ) are connected by four steps or less .",
    "more generally , we find that @xmath0 grows logarithmically with the number @xmath5 of cities in the network , @xmath6 .",
    "this behavior is consistent with both random graphs and small - world networks , but not with low - dimensional networks , for which @xmath0 grows more rapidly with @xmath5 .    still , some pairs of cities are considerably further away from each other than the average .",
    "the farthest cities in the network are mount pleasant , in the falkland islands , and wasu , in papua new guinea : to get from one city to the other , one needs to take fifteen different flights . from mount",
    "pleasant , one can fly to punta arenas , in chile , and from there to some hubs in latin america . at the other end of the path , from wasu",
    "one needs to fly to port moresby , which requires a unique sequence of eight flights . in the center of the path , between punta arenas and port moresby ,",
    "six different flights are needed .",
    "in contrast with what happens the ends of the path , in the central region of the path there are hundreds of different flight combinations , all of them connecting punta arenas and port moresby in six steps .",
    "the clustering coefficient @xmath7 , which quantifies the local cliquishness of a network , is defined as the probability that two cities that are directly connected to a third city are also directly connected to each other .",
    "we find that @xmath7 is typically larger for the air transportation network than for a random graph and that it increases with size .",
    "these results are consistent with the expectations for a small - world network but not those for a random graph . for the world - wide network ,",
    "we find @xmath8 while its randomization yields @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the air transportation network is , as expected , a small - world network @xcite .    another fundamental aspect in which real - world networks often deviate from the random graphs typically considered in mathematical analysis @xcite is the degree distribution , that is , the distribution of the number of links of the nodes @xcite . in binomial random graphs ,",
    "all nodes have similar degrees , while many real world networks have some nodes that are significantly more connected than others .",
    "specifically , many complex networks , termed scale - free , have degree distributions that decay as a power law . a plausible mechanism for such a phenomenon is preferential attachment @xcite , that is , the tendency to connect preferentially to nodes with already high degrees .",
    "to gain greater insight into the structure and evolution of the air transportation network , we calculate the degree distribution of the cities .",
    "the degree of a city is the number of other cities to which it is connected by a non - stop flight . in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a , we show the cumulative degree distribution gives the probability that a city has @xmath10 or more connections to other cities , and is defined as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the probability density function . ] for the world - wide air transportation network .",
    "the data suggest that @xmath13 has a truncated power - law decaying tail @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the power law exponent , @xmath16 is a truncation function , and @xmath17 is a crossover value that depends on the size of the network . the measured value of the exponent @xmath18 would imply that , as one increases the size of the network , the average degree of the cities are also expected to increase @xcite .",
    "the degree of a node is a source of information on its importance .",
    "however , the degree does not provide complete information on the _ role _ of the node in the network . to start to address this issue",
    ", we consider the `` betweenness centrality '' of the cities comprising the world - wide air transportation network .",
    "the betweenness @xmath19 of city @xmath20 is defined as the number of shortest paths connecting any two cities that involve a transfer at city @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "we define the normalized betweenness as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 represents the average betweenness for the network .",
    "we plot , in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b , the cumulative distribution @xmath23 of the normalized betweenness for the world - wide air transportation network .",
    "our results suggest that the distribution of betweennesses for the air transportation network obeys the functional form @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the power law exponent , @xmath26 is a truncation function , and @xmath27 is a crossover value that depends on the size of the network .",
    "a question prompted by the previous results regarding the degree and the centrality of cities is : `` are the _ most connected _ cities also the _ most central _ ? '' to answer this question , we analyze first the network obtained by randomizing the world - wide air transportation network ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) .",
    "we find that the distribution of betweennesses still decays as a power law but , in this case , with a much larger exponent value @xmath28 .",
    "this finding indicates the existence of anomalously large betweenness centralities in the air transportation network .",
    "for the randomized network , the degree of a node and its betweenness centrality are strongly correlated ",
    ", highly connected nodes are also the most central ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]a ) .",
    "in contrast , for the world - wide air transportation network it turns out that there are cities that are not hubs ",
    ", have small degrees  but that nonetheless have very large betweennesses ( fig . [ fig3]a ) .",
    "to better illustrate this finding , we plot the 25 most connected cities and contrast such a plot with another of the 25 most `` central '' cities according to their betweenness ( figs .",
    "[ fig3]b and c ) .",
    "while the most connected cities are located mostly in western europe and north america , the most central cities are distributed uniformly across all the continents .",
    "significantly , each continent has at least one central city , which is typically highly - connected when compared to other cities in the continent  johannesburg in africa or buenos aires and so paulo in south america .",
    "interestingly , besides these cities with relatively large degree , there are others  such as anchorage ( alaska , u.s . ) and port moresby ( papua new guinea)that , despite having small degrees are among the most central in the network ( table  1 ) .",
    "nodes with small degree and large centrality can be regarded as anomalies .",
    "other complex networks that have been described in the literature , like the internet @xcite , do not display such a behavior , and nodes with the highest degree are also those with the highest betweenness @xcite .",
    "it is , in principle , easy to construct a network in which a node has small degree and large centrality ",
    "think , for example , of a network formed by two communities that are connected to one another through a single node with only two links .",
    "the relevant question is , however , `` what general and plausible mechanism would give rise to scale - free networks with the obtained anomalous distribution of betweenness centralities ? ''    to answer this question it is useful to consider a region such as alaska .",
    "alaska is a sparsely populated , isolated region with a disproportionately large  for its population size ",
    "number of airports .",
    "most alaskan airports have connections only to other alaskan airports .",
    "this fact makes sense geographically . however , distance - wise it would also make sense for some alaskan airports to be connected to airports in canada s northern territories .",
    "these connections are , however , absent .",
    "instead , a few alaskan airports , singularly anchorage , are connected to the continental us .",
    "the reason is clear , the alaskan population needs to be connected to the political centers , which are located in the continental us , while there are political constraints making it difficult to have connections to cities in canada , even to ones that are close geographically @xcite .",
    "it is now obvious why anchorage s centrality is so large .",
    "indeed , the existence of nodes with anomalous centrality is related to the existence of regions with a high density of airports but few connections to the outside .",
    "the degree - betweenness anomaly is therefore ultimately related to the existence of `` communities '' in the network .",
    "the unexpected finding of central nodes with low degree is a very important one because central nodes play a key role in phenomena such as diffusion and congestion @xcite , and in the cohesiveness of complex networks @xcite .",
    "therefore , our finding of anomalous centralities points to the need to ( i ) identify the communities in the air transportation network and ( ii ) establish new ways to characterize the role of each city based on its pattern of intra- and inter - community connections and not merely on its degree .",
    "_ community structure _ to identify communities in the air transportation network , we use the definition of modularity introduced in refs .",
    "the modularity of a given partition of the nodes into groups is maximum when nodes that are densely connected among them are grouped together and separated from the other nodes in the network . to find the partition that maximizes the modularity , we use simulated annealing @xcite .",
    "we display in fig .",
    "[ modules ] the communities identified by our algorithm in the world - wide air transportation network .    as we surmised , both alaska and papua new guinea form separate communities .",
    "this fact explains the large betweenness centrality of anchorage and port moresby , as they provide the main links to the outside world for the other cities in their communities .",
    "another significant result is that even though geographical distance plays a clear role in the definition of the communities , the composition of some of the communities can not be explained by purely geographical considerations .",
    "for example , the community that contains most cities in europe also contains most airports in asian russia .",
    "similarly , chinese and japanese cities are mostly grouped with cities in the other countries in southeast asia , but india is mostly grouped with the arabic peninsula countries and with countries in northeastern africa .",
    "these facts are consistent with the important role of political factors in determining community structure @xcite .    _",
    "global role of cities _ we characterize the role of each city in the air transportation network based on its pattern of intra- and inter - community connections .",
    "we first distinguish nodes that play the role of hubs in their communities from those that are non - hubs .",
    "note that cities like anchorage are hubs in their communities but they are not hubs if one considers all the nodes in the network .",
    "thus , we define the within - community degree of a node .",
    "if @xmath29 is the number of links of node @xmath20 to other nodes in its community @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the average of @xmath32 over all the nodes in @xmath30 , and @xmath33 is the standard deviation of @xmath32 in @xmath30 , then @xmath34 is the so - called @xmath35-score .",
    "the within - community degree @xmath35-score measures how `` well - connected '' node @xmath20 is to other nodes in the community .",
    "we then distinguish nodes based on their connections to nodes in communities other than their own .",
    "for example , two nodes with the same @xmath35-score will play different roles if one of them is connected to several nodes in other communities while the other is not .",
    "we define the participation coefficient @xmath36 of node @xmath20 as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the number of links of node @xmath20 to nodes in community @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is the total degree of node @xmath20 .",
    "the participation coefficient of a node is therefore close to one if its links are uniformly distributed among all the communities , and zero if all its links are within its own community .",
    "we hypothesize that the role of a node can be determined , to a great extent , by its within - module degree and its participation coefficient @xcite .",
    "we define heuristically seven different `` universal roles , '' each one corresponding to a different region in the @xmath41 phase - space . according to the within - module degree ,",
    "we classify nodes with @xmath42 as module hubs and nodes @xmath43 as non - hubs .",
    "both hub and non - hub nodes are then more finely characterized by using the values of the participation coefficient @xcite .",
    "we divide non - hub nodes into four different roles : ( r1 ) _ ultra - peripheral nodes _ ,",
    "i.e. , nodes with all their links within their module ( @xmath44 ) ; ( r2 ) _ peripheral nodes _ , i.e. , nodes with most links within their module ( @xmath45 ) ; ( r3 ) _ non - hub connector nodes _ ,",
    "i.e. , nodes with many links to other modules ( @xmath46 ) ; and ( r4 ) _ non - hub kinless nodes _ , i.e. , nodes with links homogeneously distributed among all modules ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "we divide hub nodes into three different roles : ( r5 ) _ provincial hubs_. i.e. , hub nodes with the vast majority of links within their module ( @xmath48 ) ; ( r6 ) _ connector hubs _ , i.e. , hubs with many links to most of the other modules ( @xmath49 ) ; and ( r7 ) _ kinless hubs _ , i.e. , hubs with links homogeneously distributed among all modules ( @xmath50 ) .    for each city in the world - wide air transportation network",
    ", we calculate its within - community degree @xmath51 and its participation coefficient @xmath36 .",
    "then , we assign each city a role according to the definitions above ( figs .",
    "[ f - roles]a and c ) .",
    "significantly , 95.4% of the cities in the world - wide air transportation network are classified as either peripheral or ultra - peripheral .",
    "additionally , there is a small fraction of non - hub connectors ( 0.5% ) .",
    "this result suggests that cities which are not hubs in their respective communities rarely have links to many other communities in the air transportation network .",
    "this situation is in stark contrast to what happens in some biological networks , in which non - hub connectors seem to be relatively frequent and to play an important role @xcite .",
    "the remaining 4.1% of the nodes are hubs .",
    "we find approximately equal fractions of provincial and connector hubs .",
    "the former include cities that , for historical , political , or geographical reasons , are comparatively not well - connected to other communities .",
    "examples are denver , philadelphia , and detroit , in north america ; stuttgart , copenhagen , istanbul , and barcelona , in the community formed by europe , north africa and the former soviet union ; adelaide and christchurch in oceania ; brasilia in south america ; fairbanks and juneau in alaska ; and the already discussed case of port moresby .",
    "connector hubs include the most recognizable airport hubs in the word : chicago , new york , los angeles , and mexico city in north america ; frankfurt , london , paris , and rome in europe ; beijing , tokyo , and seoul in the south - eastern asian community ; delhi , abu dhabi , and kuwait in the community comprising india , the arabic peninsula and north - eastern africa ; buenos aires , santiago , and so paulo in south america ; melbourne , auckland , and sydney in oceania ; and anchorage in alaska .",
    "the fractions of cities with each role in the world - wide air transportation network contrast with the corresponding fractions in a randomization of the network ( fig .",
    "[ f - roles]b ) . in this case , the community identification algorithm still yields certain communities , but the network lacks `` real '' community structure .",
    "the identification of roles enables one to realize that these communities are somehow artificial .",
    "indeed , many cities are either kinless hubs or kinless non - hubs due to the absence of a real community structure , and the network contains essentially no provincial or connector hubs .",
    "we carried out a `` systems '' analysis of the structure of the world - wide air transportation network .",
    "the study enables us to unveil a number of significant results .",
    "the world - wide air transportation network is a small - word network in which : ( i ) the number of non - stop connections from a given city , and ( ii ) the number of shortest paths going through a given city have distributions that are scale - free . surprisingly , the nodes with more connections are not always the most central in the network .",
    "we hypothesize that the origin of such a behavior is the multi - community structure of the network .",
    "we find the communities in the network and demonstrate that their structure can only be understood in terms of both geographical and political considerations .",
    "our analysis of the community structure of the air transportation network is important for two additional reasons .",
    "first , it allow us to identify the most efficient ways in which to engineer the structure of the network .",
    "specifically , having identified the communities , one can identify which ones are poorly connected and the ways to minimize that problem .",
    "second , cities that connect different communities play a disproportionate role in important dynamic processes such as the propagation of infections such as sars . as , we show , finding the communities is the first step toward identifying these cities .    the existence of communities and the understanding that different cities may have very different impacts on the global behavior of the air transportation system , call for the definition of the role of each city .",
    "we address this issue by classifying cities into seven roles , according to their patterns of inter- and intra - community connections .",
    "we find that most of the nodes ( 95% ) are peripheral , that is , the vast majority of their connections are within their own communities .",
    "we also find that nodes that connect different communities are typically hubs within their own community , although not necessarily global hubs .",
    "this finding is in stark contrast with the behavior observed in certain biological networks , in which non - hub connectors are more frequent @xcite .",
    "the fact that different networks seem to be formed by nodes with network - specific roles points to the more general question of what evolutionary constraints and pressures determine the topology of complex networks , and how the presence or absence of specific roles affects the performance of these networks .",
    "we thank a. arenas , a. barrat , m. barthlmy , a. daz - guilera , a.  a. moreira , r. pastor - satorras , m. sales - pardo , d. stouffer , and a. vespignani for stimulating discussions and helpful suggestions .",
