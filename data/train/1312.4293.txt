    "since the fifth edition of protostars and planets in 2005 ( ppv ) the number of extrasolar planets has increased from about 200 to nearly 1000 , with several thousand transiting planet candidates awaiting confirmation .",
    "these prolific discoveries have emphasized the amazing diversity of exoplanetary systems .",
    "they have brought crucial constraints on models of planet formation and evolution , which need to account for the many flavors in which exoplanets come .",
    "some giant planets , widely known as the hot jupiters , orbit their star in just a couple of days , like 51 pegasus b @xcite .",
    "some others orbit their star in few ten to hundred years , like the four planets known to date in the hr  8799 planetary system @xcite . at the time of ppv",
    ", it was already established that exoplanets have a broad distribution of eccentricity , with a median value @xmath0 @xcite . since then",
    ", measurements of the rossiter mclaughlin effect in about 50 planetary systems have revealed several hot jupiters on orbits highly misaligned with the equatorial plane of their star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting that exoplanets could also have a broad distribution of inclination . not only should models of planet formation and evolution explain the most exotic flavors in which exoplanets come , they should also reproduce their statistical properties .",
    "this is challenging , because the predictions of such models depend sensitively on the many key processes that come into play .",
    "one of these key processes is the interaction of forming planets with their parent protoplanetary disc , which is the scope of this chapter .",
    "planet - disc interactions play a prominent role in the orbital evolution of young forming planets , leading to potentially large variations not only in their semi - major axis ( a process known as planet migration ) , but also in their eccentricity and inclination .",
    "observations ( i ) of hot jupiters on orbits aligned with the equatorial plane of their star , ( ii ) of systems with several coplanar low - mass planets with short and intermediate orbital periods ( like those discovered by the kepler mission ) , ( iii ) and of many near - resonant multi - planet systems , are evidence that planet - disc interactions are one major ingredient in shaping the architecture of observed planetary systems .",
    "but , it is not the only ingredient : planet - planet and star - planet interactions are also needed to account for the diversity of exoplanetary systems .",
    "the long - term evolution of planetary systems after the dispersal of their protoplanetary disc is reviewed in the chapter by davies et al .",
    "this chapter commences with a general description of planet - disc interactions in section  [ sec : theory ] .",
    "basic processes and recent progress are presented with the aim of letting non - experts pick up a physical intuition and a sense of the effects in planet - disc interactions .",
    "section  [ sec : app ] continues with a discussion on the role played by planet - disc interactions in the properties and architecture of observed planetary systems .",
    "summary points follow in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "embedded planets interact with the surrounding disc mainly through gravity . disc material , in orbit around the central star , feels a gravitational perturbation caused by the planet that can lead to an exchange of energy and angular momentum between planet and disc . in this section , we assume that the perturbations due to the planet are small , so that the disc structure does not change significantly due to the planet , and that migration is slow , so that any effects of the radial movement of the planet can be neglected . we will return to these issues in sections  [ sec : type2 ] and  [ sec : type3 ] . if these assumptions are valid , we are in the regime of type i migration , and we are dealing with low - mass planets ( typically up to neptune s mass ) .    the perturbations in the disc induced by the planet are traditionally split into two parts : ( i ) a wave part , where the disc response comes in the form of spiral density waves propagating throughout the disc from the planet location , and ( ii ) a part confined in a narrow region around the planet s orbital radius , called the planet s horseshoe region , where disc material executes horseshoe turns relative to the planet .",
    "an illustration of both perturbations is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : overview ] .",
    "we will deal with each of them separately below . for simplicity",
    ", we will focus on a two - dimensional disc , characterised by vertically averaged quantities such as the surface density @xmath1 .",
    "we make use of cylindrical polar coordinates @xmath2 centred on the star .",
    "it has been known for a long time that a planet exerting a gravitational force on its parent disc can launch waves in the disc at lindblad resonances @xcite .",
    "these correspond to locations where the gas azimuthal velocity relative to the planet matches the phase velocity of acoustic waves in the azimuthal direction .",
    "this phase velocity depends on the azimuthal wavenumber , the sound speed and the epicyclic frequency , that is the oscillation frequency of a particle in the disc subject to a small radial displacement ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at large azimuthal wavenumber",
    ", the phase velocity tends to the sound speed , and lindblad resonances therefore pile up at @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the semi - major axis of the planet and @xmath5 is the pressure scaleheight of the disc @xcite .",
    "the superposition of the waves launched at lindblad resonances gives rise to a one - armed spiral density wave @xcite , called the wake ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : overview ] ) .",
    "it is possible to solve the wave excitation problem in the linear approximation and calculate analytically the resulting torque exerted on the disc using the wkb approximation @xcite .",
    "progress beyond analytical calculations for planets on circular orbits has been made by solving the linear perturbation equations numerically , as done in 2d in @xcite .",
    "the three - dimensional case was tackled in @xcite , which resulted in a widely used torque formula valid for isothermal discs only .",
    "it is important to note that 2d calculations only give comparable results to more realistic 3d calculations if the gravitational potential of the planet is softened appropriately .",
    "typically , the softening length has to be a sizeable fraction of the disc scaleheight @xcite . using",
    "this 2d softened gravity approach , @xcite found that the dependence of the wave torque ( @xmath6 ) on disc gradients in a non - isothermal , adiabatic disc is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the ratio of specific heats , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are negatives of the ( local ) power law exponents of the surface density @xmath1 and temperature @xmath11 ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) , and the torque is normalised by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the planet - to - star mass ratio , @xmath16 is the aspect ratio and quantities with subscript @xmath17 refer to the location of the planet . note that in general we expect @xmath18 , i.e. both surface density and temperature decrease outward . for reasonable values of @xmath9 ,",
    "the wave torque on the planet is negative : it decreases the orbital angular momentum of the planet , and thus its semi - major axis ( the planet being on a circular orbit ) , leading to inward migration . the linear approximation remains valid as long as @xmath19 @xcite . for a disc around a solar mass star with @xmath20",
    "this means that the planet mass needs to be much smaller than @xmath21 @xmath22 .",
    "the factor @xmath8 in eq .",
    "( [ eqtl ] ) is due to the difference in sound speed between isothermal and adiabatic discs @xcite . for discs that can cool efficiently ,",
    "we expect the isothermal result to be valid ( @xmath23 ) , while for discs that can not cool efficiently , the adiabatic result should hold .",
    "it is possible to define an effective @xmath8 that depends on the thermal diffusion coefficient so that the isothermal regime can be connected smoothly to the adiabatic regime @xcite .",
    "a generalized expression for the lindblad torque has been derived by @xcite for 2d discs where the density and temperature profiles near the planet are not power laws , like at opacity transitions or near cavities .",
    "this generalized expression agrees well with eq .",
    "( [ eqtl ] ) for power - law discs .",
    "we stress that there is to date no general expression for the wave torque in 3d non - isothermal discs .",
    "the analytics is involved @xcite and it is difficult to measure the wave torque independently from the corotation torque in 3d numerical simulations of planet - disc interactions .    the above discussion neglected possible effects of self - gravity .",
    "@xcite showed that in a self - gravitating disc , lindblad resonances get shifted towards the planet , thereby making the wave torque stronger .",
    "this was confirmed numerically by @xcite .",
    "the impact of a magnetic field in the disc and of possibly related mhd turbulence will be considered in section  [ sec : turb ] .",
    "the normalisation factor @xmath24 sets a time scale for type i migration of planets on circular orbits : @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the mass of the central star .",
    "assuming a typical gas surface density of @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath20 , the migration time scale in years at 1 astronomical unit ( au ) is given approximately by @xmath29 .",
    "this means that an earth - mass planet at 1 au would migrate inward on a time scale of @xmath30 years , while the time scale for neptune would only be @xmath31 years .",
    "all these time scales are shorter than the expected disc life time of @xmath32 years , making this type of migration far too efficient for planets to survive on orbits of several au .",
    "a lot of work has been done recently on how to stop type i migration or make it less efficient ( see sections [ sec : coro ] and [ sec : coro_satu ] ) .",
    "most progress since ppv @xcite has been made in understanding the torque due to disc material that on average corotates with the planet , the corotation torque .",
    "it is possible , by solving the linearised disc equations in the same way as for the wave torque , to obtain a numerical value for the corotation torque .",
    "one can show that in the case of an isothermal disc , this torque scales with the local gradient in specific vorticity or vortensity @xcite .",
    "it therefore has a stronger dependence on background surface density gradients than the wave torque , with shallower profiles giving rise to a more positive torque .",
    "it was nevertheless found in @xcite that , except for extreme surface density profiles , the wave torque always dominates over the linear corotation torque ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "@xcite obtained , in the 2d softened gravity approach , for a non - isothermal disc @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the negative of the ( local ) power law exponent of the specific entropy . for an isothermal disc , @xmath36 and",
    "the corotation torque is proportional to the vortensity gradient .",
    "an alternative expression for the corotation torque was derived by @xcite by considering disc material on horseshoe orbits relative to the planet .",
    "this disc material defines the planet s horseshoe region ( see bottom panel in fig .  [",
    "fig : overview ] ) .",
    "the torque on the planet due to disc material executing horseshoe turns , the horseshoe drag , scales with the vortensity gradient in an isothermal disc , just like the linear corotation torque .",
    "it comes about because material in an isothermal inviscid fluid conserves its vortensity .",
    "when executing a horseshoe turn , which takes a fluid element to a region of different vorticity because of the keplerian shear , conservation of vortensity dictates that the surface density should change @xcite . in a gas disc , this change in surface density is smoothed out by evanescent pressure waves @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this change in surface density results in a torque being applied on the planet .    for low - mass planets , for which @xmath37 , the half - width of the horseshoe region , @xmath38 , is @xcite @xmath39",
    "thus it is only a fraction of the local disc thickness .",
    "the horseshoe drag , which scales as @xmath40 @xcite , therefore has the same dependence on @xmath15 and @xmath41 as the wave torque and the linear corotation torque .",
    "the numerical coefficient in front is generally much larger than for the linear corotation torque , however @xcite . since both approaches aim at describing the same thing , _ the _ corotation torque , it was long unclear which result to use .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that whenever horseshoe turns occur , the linear corotation torque gets replaced by the horseshoe drag , unless a sufficiently strong viscosity is applied .",
    "it should be noted that horseshoe turns do not exist within linear theory , making linear theory essentially invalid for low - mass planets as far as the corotation torque is concerned .",
    "the corotation torque in the form of horseshoe drag is very sensitive to the disc s viscosity and thermal properties near the planet .",
    "@xcite found that in 3d radiation hydrodynamical simulations , migration can in fact be directed _ outwards _ due to a strong positive corotation torque counterbalancing the negative wave torque over the short duration ( 15 planet orbits ) of their calculations .",
    "this was subsequently interpreted as being due to a radial gradient in disc specific entropy , which gives rise to a new horseshoe drag component due to conservation of entropy in an adiabatic disc @xcite .",
    "the situation is , however , not as simple as for the isothermal case .",
    "it turns out that the entropy - related horseshoe drag arises from the production of vorticity along the downstream separatrices of the planet s horseshoe region @xcite .",
    "conservation of entropy during a horseshoe turn leads to a jump in entropy along the separatrices whenever there is a radial gradient of entropy in the disc .",
    "this jump in entropy acts as a source of vorticity , which in turn leads to a torque on the planet .",
    "crucially , the amount of vorticity produced depends on the streamline topology , in particular the distance of the stagnation point to the planet .",
    "an analytical model for an adiabatic disc where the background temperature is constant was developed in @xcite , while @xcite used a combination of physical arguments and numerical results to obtain the following expression for the horseshoe drag : @xmath42 where the first term on the right hand side is the vortensity - related part of the horseshoe drag , and the second term is the entropy - related part .",
    "the model derived in @xcite , under the same assumptions for the stagnation point , yields a numerical coefficient for the entropy - related part of the horseshoe drag of @xmath43 instead of @xmath44 .    comparing the linear corotation torque to the non - linear horseshoe drag ",
    "see eqs .",
    "( [ eqtclin ] ) and  ( [ eqtchs ] )  we see that both depend on surface density and entropy gradients , but also that the horseshoe drag is always stronger . in the inner regions of discs primarily heated by viscous heating , the entropy profile should decrease outward ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the corotation torque should then be positive , promoting outward migration .",
    "the results presented above were for adiabatic discs , while the isothermal result can be recovered by setting @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( which makes @xmath36 as well ) .",
    "real discs are neither isothermal nor adiabatic .",
    "when the disc can cool efficiently , which happens in the optically thin outer parts , the isothermal result is expected to be valid ( or rather the _ locally _ isothermal result : a disc with a fixed temperature profile , which behaves slightly differently from a truly isothermal disc ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the optically thick inner parts of the disc",
    ", cooling is not efficient and the adiabatic result should hold .",
    "an interpolation between the two regimes was presented in @xcite and @xcite .      while density waves transport angular momentum away from the planet , the horseshoe region only has a finite amount of angular momentum to play with since there are no waves involved .",
    "sustaining the corotation torque therefore requires a flow of angular momentum into the horseshoe region : unlike the wave torque , the corotation torque is prone to _ saturation_. in simulations of disc - planet interactions , sustaining ( or unsaturating ) the corotation torque is usually established by including a navier - stokes viscosity . in a real disc , angular momentum transport is likely due to turbulence arising from the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ; see chapter by turner et al . ) , and simulations of turbulent discs give comparable results to viscous discs @xcite as far as saturation is concerned ( see also section  [ sec : turb ] ) .",
    "the main result for viscous discs is that the viscous diffusion time scale across the horseshoe region has to be shorter than the libration time scale in order for the horseshoe drag to be unsaturated @xcite .",
    "this also holds for non - isothermal discs , and expressions for the corotation torque have been derived in 2d disc models for general levels of viscosity and thermal diffusion or cooling @xcite .",
    "results from 2d radiation hydrodynamic simulations , where the disc is self - consistently heated by viscous dissipation and cooled by radiative losses , confirm this picture @xcite .    the torque expressions of @xcite and @xcite were derived using 2d disc models , and 3d disc models are still required to get definitive , accurate predictions for the wave and the corotation torques . still , the predictions of the aforementioned torque expressions are in decent agreement with the results of 3d simulations of planet - disc interactions .",
    "the simulations of @xcite explored the dependence of the total torque with density and temperature gradients in 3d locally isothermal discs .",
    "they found the total normalized torque @xmath48 .",
    "for the planet mass and disc viscosity of these authors , the corotation torque reduces to the linear corotation torque . summing eqs .",
    "( [ eqtl ] ) and  ( [ eqtclin ] ) with @xmath46 and @xmath49 yields @xmath50 , which is in good agreement with the results of @xcite , except for the coefficient in front of the temperature gradient .",
    "the simulations of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite were for non - isothermal radiative discs .",
    "@xcite considered various temperature power - law profiles and showed that the total torque does not always exhibit a linear dependence with temperature gradient .",
    "@xcite highlighted substantial discrepancies between the torque predictions of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these discrepancies originate from a larger half - width ( @xmath38 ) of the planet s horseshoe region adopted in @xcite , which was suggested as a proxy to assess the corotation torque in 3d .",
    "adopting the same , standard value for @xmath51 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq_xs ] ) , one can show that the total torques of @xcite and @xcite are actually in very good agreement .",
    "both are less positive than in the numerical results of @xcite .",
    "discrepancies originate from inherent torque differences between 2d and 3d disc models ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and possibly from a non - linear boost of the positive corotation torque in the simulations of @xcite , for which @xmath52 ( for locally isothermal discs , see * ? ? ?",
    "the thermal structure of protoplanetary discs is determined not only by viscous heating and radiative cooling , but also by stellar irradiation .",
    "the effects of stellar irradiation on the disc structure have been widely investigated using a 1 + 1d numerical approach ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with the goal to fit the spectral energy distributions of observed discs .",
    "stellar heating dominates in the outer regions of discs , viscous heating in the inner regions .",
    "the disc s aspect ratio should then slowly increase with increasing distance from the star @xcite .",
    "this increase may have important implications for the direction and speed of type i migration which , as we have seen above , are quite sensitive to the aspect ratio ( local value and radial profile ) .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : migration ] , which displays the torque acting on type  i migrating planets sitting in the midplane of their disc , with and without inclusion of stellar irradiation .",
    "the disc structure was calculated in @xcite for standard opacities and a constant disc viscosity ( thereby fixing the density profile ) .",
    "two regions of outward migration originate from opacity transitions at the silicate condensation line ( near 0.8 au ) and at the water ice line ( near 5 au ) . in this model ,",
    "heating by stellar irradiation becomes prominent beyond @xmath53 au .",
    "the resulting increase in the disc s aspect ratio profile gives a shallower entropy profile ( @xmath10 and thus @xmath54 take smaller values ) and therefore a smaller ( though positive ) entropy - related horseshoe drag ",
    "see eq .  ( [ eqtchs ] ) .",
    "inclusion of stellar irradiation therefore reduces the range of orbital separations at which outward migration may occur ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the outer edge of regions of outward migration are locations where type  i planetary cores converge , which may lead to resonant captures @xcite and could enhance planet growth if enough cores are present to overcome the trapping process . note in fig .",
    "[ fig : migration ] that planets up to @xmath55 do not migrate outwards .",
    "this is because for such planet masses , and for the disc viscosity in this model ( @xmath56 a few @xmath57 ) , the corotation torque is replaced by the ( smaller ) linear corotation torque .",
    "[ fig : migration ] provides a good example of how sensitive predictions of planet migration models can be to the structure of protoplanetary discs .",
    "future observations of discs , for example with alma , will give precious information that will help constrain migration models .",
    "so far we have considered the migration of a planet in a purely hydrodynamical laminar disc where turbulence is modelled by an effective viscosity . as stressed in section  [ sec : coro ] , a turbulent viscosity is essential to unsaturate the corotation torque .",
    "the most likely ( and best studied ) source of turbulence in protoplanetary discs is the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ; * ? ? ? * ) which can amplify the magnetic field and drive mhd turbulence by tapping energy from the keplerian shear .",
    "furthermore , the powerful jets observed to be launched from protoplanetary discs are thought to arise from a strong magnetic field ( likely through the magneto - centrifugal acceleration ; see * ? ? ?",
    "magnetic field and turbulence thus play a crucial role in the dynamics and evolution of protoplanetary discs , and need to be taken into account in theories of planet - disc interactions .    _ stochastic torque driven by turbulence .",
    "_ mhd turbulence excites non - axisymmetric density waves ( see left panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : turbulence_magnetic ] ) which cause a fluctuating component of the torque on a planet in a turbulent disc @xcite . this torque changes sign stochastically with a typical correlation time of a fraction of an orbit .",
    "because the density perturbations are driven by turbulence rather than the planet itself , the specific torque due to turbulence is independent of planet mass , while the ( time - averaged ) specific torque driving type i migration is proportional to the planet mass .",
    "type i migration should therefore outweigh the stochastic torque for sufficiently massive planets and on a long - term evolution , whereas stochastic migration arising from turbulence should dominate the evolution of planetesimals and possibly small mass planetary cores @xcite .",
    "the stochastic torque adds a random walk component to planet migration , which can be represented in a statistical sense by a diffusion process acting on the probability distribution of planets @xcite .",
    "a consequence of this is that a small fraction of planets may migrate to the outer parts of their disc even if the laminar type i migration is directed inwards .",
    "note that the presence of a dead zone around the disc s midplane , where mhd turbulence is quenched due the low ionization , reduces the amplitude of the stochastic torque @xcite .",
    "_ mean migration in a turbulent disc .",
    "_ 2d hydrodynamical simulations of discs with stochastically forced waves have been carried out to mimic mhd turbulence and to study its effects on planet migration .",
    "using @xcite s model , @xcite and @xcite showed that , when averaged over a sufficiently long time , the torque converges toward a well - defined average value , and that the effects of turbulence on this average torque are well described by an effective turbulent viscosity and heat diffusion .",
    "in particular , the wave torque is little affected by turbulence , while the corotation torque can be unsaturated by this wake - like turbulence . @xcite and @xcite have shown that a similar conclusion holds in simulations with fully developed mhd turbulence arising from the mri .",
    "@xcite however discovered the presence of an additional component of the corotation torque , which has been attributed to the effect of the magnetic field ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see below ) .",
    "note that the mean migration in a turbulent disc has been conclusively studied only for fairly massive planets ( typically @xmath58 ) as less massive planets need a better resolution and a longer averaging time .",
    "it is an open question whether the migration of smaller planets is affected by turbulence in a similar way as by a diffusion process .",
    "one may wonder indeed whether the diffusion approximation remains valid when the width of the planet s horseshoe region is a small fraction of the disc scaleheight and therefore of the typical correlation length of turbulence .    _ wave torque with a magnetic field .",
    "_ in addition to driving turbulence , the magnetic field has a direct effect on planet migration by modifying the response of the gas to the planet s potential .",
    "in particular , waves propagation is modified by the magnetic field and three types of waves exist : fast and slow magneto - sonic waves as well as alfv ' en waves .",
    "@xcite showed that for a strong azimuthal magnetic field , slow mhd waves are launched at the so - called magnetic resonances , which are located where the gas azimuthal velocity relative to the planet matches the phase velocity of slow mhd waves . the angular momentum carried by the slow mhd waves",
    "gives rise to a new component of the torque .",
    "if the magnetic field strength is steeply decreasing outwards , this new torque is positive and may lead to outward migration @xcite .",
    "a vertical magnetic field also impacts the resonances @xcite but its effect on the total torque remains to be established . in the inner parts of protoplanetary discs ,",
    "the presence of a strong vertical magnetic field is needed to explain the launching of observed jets",
    ". a better understanding of the strength and evolution of such a vertical field @xcite and of its effect on planet migration will improve the description of planet migration near the central star .    _ corotation torque with a magnetic field .",
    "_ a strong azimuthal magnetic field can prevent horseshoe motions so that the corotation torque is replaced by the torque arising from magnetic resonances as discussed in the previous paragraph .",
    "@xcite showed that horseshoe motions take place and suppress magnetic resonances for weak enough magnetic fields , when the alfvn speed is less than the shear velocity at the separatrices of the planet s horseshoe region . using 2d laminar simulations with effective viscosity and resistivity",
    ", these authors showed that advection of the azimuthal magnetic field along horseshoe trajectories leads to an accumulation of magnetic field near the downstream separatrices of the horseshoe region .",
    "this accumulation in turns leads to an under - density at the same location to ensure approximate pressure balance ( see right panel in fig .  [",
    "fig : turbulence_magnetic ] ) .",
    "the results of these laminar simulations agree very well with those of the mhd turbulent simulations of @xcite .",
    "a rear - front asymmetry in the magnetic field accumulation inside the horseshoe region gives rise to a new component of the corotation torque , which may cause outward migration even if the magnetic pressure is less than one percent of the thermal pressure @xcite .",
    "this new magnetic corotation torque could take over the entropy - related corotation torque to sustain outward migration in the radiatively efficient outer parts of protoplanetary discs .",
    "future studies should address the behaviour of the corotation torque in the dead zone , and in regions of the disc threaded by a vertical magnetic field . also , other non - ideal mhd effects , such as the hall effect and ambipolar diffusion , can have a significant impact on the mri turbulence and on the disc structure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these non - ideal mhd effects still need to be explored in the context of planet - disc interactions .",
    "we have so far considered planet - disc interactions for low - mass planets on circular orbits .",
    "interaction between two or more planets migrating in their parent disc may increase eccentricities ( @xmath59 ) and inclinations ( @xmath60 )  see section  [ sec : multi ] .",
    "we examine below the orbital evolution of protoplanets on eccentric or inclined orbits due to planet - disc interactions .    in the limit of small eccentricities",
    ", it can be shown that the effect of the disc is to damp the eccentricity of type  i migrating planets @xcite .",
    "similar arguments can be made for inclined low - mass planets , for which planet - disc interactions damp the inclination in time @xcite .",
    "@xcite have provided an analytic expression for the eccentricity damping time scale in 2d , while @xcite derived expressions for the eccentricity and inclination damping time scales in 3d : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : tau0 ] ) .",
    "note that , @xmath63 being very small , damping of @xmath59 and @xmath60 is much faster than migration .",
    "a single low - mass planet should therefore migrate on a circular and coplanar orbit .",
    "the above results were confirmed by hydrodynamical simulations @xcite .",
    "eccentricity and inclination damping rates can be alternatively derived using a dynamical friction formalism @xcite .    we have stressed above that the migration of low - mass planets can be directed outwards if the disc material in the horseshoe region exerts a strong positive corotation torque on the planet .",
    "numerical simulations by @xcite have shown that for small eccentricities , the magnitude of the corotation torque decreases with increasing eccentricity , which restricts the possibility of outward migration to planets with eccentricities below a few percent .",
    "a consequence of this restriction is to shift regions of convergent migration to smaller radii for mildly eccentric low - mass planets ( see last two paragraphs in section  [ sec : coro ] , and * ? ? ?",
    "in a very recent study , @xcite have explored in detail the influence of orbital eccentricity on the corotation torque for a range of disc and planet parameters .",
    "their study indicates that the reason why the corotation torque decreases with increasing @xmath59 is because the width of the horseshoe region narrows as @xmath59 increases .",
    "furthermore , by fitting the results from their suite of simulations with an analytic function , they find that the corotation torque scales with eccentricity according to the expression @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the corotation torque at eccentricity @xmath59 , @xmath66 that at zero eccentricity , and @xmath67 is an e - folding eccentricity that scales linearly with the disc aspect ratio at the planet s orbital radius ( the expression @xmath68 provides a good overall fit to the simulations ) .",
    "furthermore , the lindblad torque becomes more positive with increasing @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "this sign reversal does not necessarily lead to outward migration as the torque on an eccentric planet changes both the planet s semi - major axis and eccentricity ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "orbital migration also changes when a low - mass planet acquires some inclination .",
    "the larger the inclination , the less time the planet interacts with the dense gas near the disc midplane , the smaller the corotation torque and the migration rate .",
    "thus , inclined low - mass planets can only undergo outward migration if their inclination remains below a few degrees @xcite .",
    "the wave torque described in section  [ sec : lindblad ] is the sum of a positive torque exerted on the planet by its inner wake , and a negative torque exerted by its outer wake .",
    "equivalently , the planet gives angular momentum to the outer disc ( the disc beyond the planet s orbital radius ) , and it takes some from the inner disc . if the torque exerted by the planet on the disc is larger in absolute value than the viscous torque responsible for disc spreading , an annular gap is carved around the planet s orbit @xcite . in this simple one - dimensional picture ,",

    "while the planet is locked in its gap , it continues to migrate as the disc accretes onto the star .",
    "said differently , the planet follows the migration trajectory imposed by the disc @xcite , and the migration timescale is then the viscous accretion time , @xmath87 .",
    "however , if the planet is much more massive than the gas outside the gap , the planet will slow down the disc viscous accretion .",
    "this occurs if @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the surface density of the outer disc just outside the gap .",
    "when this occurs , the inner disc still accretes onto the star , while the outer disc is held by the planet .",

    "therefore , the migration of planets that marginally satisfy the gap - opening criterion can be slower than in the standard type  ii migration . in particular , if the gap density is large enough , and depending on the local density and temperature gradients , the corotation torque can overcome the viscous torque and lead to outward migration @xcite .",
    "note that the drift of the planet relative to the gas may lead to a positive feedback on migration ( see section  [ sec : type3 ] ) .",

    "* ) , and this structure is often claimed to be the signpost of a giant planet carving a big gap in the disc . it should be kept in mind , however , that the gap opened by a planet is usually much narrower than these observed depletions ( see section  [ sec : gapopening ] ) , and rarely ( completely ) gas proof .",

    "therefore , the observation of a cavity should depend on the size of the tracked dust , that is on the wavelength . interpreting observations",

    "another issue is to address how a circumplanetary disc impacts migration .",
    "being bound to the planet , the circumplanetary disc migrates at the same drift rate as the planet s .",
    "issues arise in hydrodynamical simulations that discard the disc s self - gravity , as in this case the wave torque can only apply to the planet , and not to its circumplanetary material .",

    "another solution suggested by these authors and also adopted by @xcite is to imprint to the circumplanetary disc the acceleration felt by the planet .",
    "the early evolution of the solar system in the primordial gas solar nebula should have led the four giant planets to be in a compact resonant configuration , on quasi - circular and coplanar orbits @xcite .",

    "this is the so - called nice model .",
    "many massive exoplanets have much higher eccentricities than the planets in the solar system .",
    "also , recent measurements of the rossiter - mclaughlin effect have reported several hot jupiters with large obliquities , which indicates that massive planets could also acquire a large inclination during their evolution .",

    "the 3:1 mean motion resonance between a planet and the disc excites eccentricity @xcite .",

    "alternatively , in dense stellar clusters , the interaction with a temporary stellar companion could tilt the disc s rotation axis @xcite .",
    "however , both mechanisms should be extended by including the interaction between the disc and the magnetic field of the central star .",
    "this interaction might tilt the star s rotation axis , and lead to misalignments even in discs that are initially aligned with their star @xcite .      under most circumstances , such as those presented in the previous sections ,",
    "the migration rate of a planet is provided by the value of the disc torque , which depends on the local properties of the underlying disc , but not on the migration rate itself .",
    "there are some circumstances , however , in which the torque also depends on the drift rate , in which case one has the constituting elements of a feedback loop , with potentially important implications for migration .",
    "this , in particular , is the case of giant or sub - giant planets embedded in massive discs , which deplete ( at least partially ) their horseshoe region .",
    "the corotation torque comes from material that executes horseshoe u - turns relative to the planet .",
    "most of this material is trapped in the planet s horseshoe region . however",
    ", if there is a net drift of the planet with respect to the disc , material outside the horseshoe region will execute a unique horseshoe u - turn relative to the planet , and by doing so will exchange angular momentum with the planet .",
    "this drift may come about because of migration , and/or because the disc has a radial viscous drift .",
    "the torque arising from orbit - crossing material naturally scales with the mass flow rate across the orbit , which depends on the relative drift of the planet and the disc .",
    "it thus depends on the migration rate .    for the sake of definiteness",
    ", we consider hereafter a planet moving inwards relative to the disc , but it should be kept in mind that the processes at work here are essentially reversible , so that they can also be applied to an outward moving planet .",
    "the picture above shows that the corotation torque on a planet migrating inwards has three contributions :    * the contribution of the inner disc material flowing across the orbit . as this material gains angular momentum",
    ", it exerts a negative torque on the planet which scales with the drift rate .",
    "it therefore tends to increase the migration rate , and yields a positive feedback on the migration . *",
    "the contribution of the coorbital material in the planet s horseshoe region .",
    "it is two - fold .",
    "a first component arises from the material that exerts a horseshoe drag on the planet , which corresponds to the same horseshoe drag as if there was no drift between the disc and the planet ( see section  [ sec : coro ] ) . * furthermore , as the material in the horseshoe region can be regarded as trapped in the vicinity of the planetary orbit , it has to move inward at the same rate as the planet .",
    "the planet then exerts on this material a negative torque , which scales with the drift rate . by the law of action - reaction , this trapped material yields a second , positive component of the horseshoe drag on the planet that scales with the drift rate .",
    "thus , the contribution of the drifting trapped horseshoe material also yields a negative feedback on the migration .",
    "if the surface density profile of the disc is unaltered by the planet , that is if the angular momentum profile of the disc is unaltered , then contributions ( i ) and ( iii ) exactly cancel out @xcite . in that case",
    ", the net corotation torque reduces to contribution ( ii ) , and the corotation torque expressions presented in section  [ sec : coro ] , which have been derived assuming that the planet is on fixed circular orbit , are valid regardless of the migration rate .",
    "conversely , if the planet depletes , at least partly , its horseshoe region ( when @xmath101 a few ) , contributions ( i ) and ( iii ) do not cancel out , and the net corotation torque depends on the migration rate .",
    "the above description shows that the coorbital dynamics causes a feedback on migration when planets open a gap around their orbit .",
    "there are two key quantities to assess in order to determine when the feedback causes the migration to run away .",
    "the first quantity is called the coorbital mass deficit ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "it represents the mass that should be added to the planet s horseshoe region so that it has the average surface density of the orbit - crossing flow .",
    "the second quantity is the sum of the planet mass ( @xmath103 ) and of the circumplanetary disc mass ( @xmath104 ) , that is the quantity @xmath105 . as shown in @xcite",
    ", two regimes may occur . if @xmath106 , the coorbital dynamics accelerates the migration , but there is no runaway .",
    "on the contrary , if @xmath107 , migration runs away . a more rigorous derivation performed by @xcite shows that the coorbital mass deficit actually features the inverse vortensity in place of the surface density , but the same qualitative picture holds .",
    "when migration runs away , the drift rate has an exponentially growing behaviour until the so - called fast regime is reached , in which the planet migrates a sizable fraction of the horseshoe width in less than a libration time .",
    "when that occurs , the drift rate settles to a finite , large value , which defines the regime of type  iii migration . as stressed earlier",
    ", this drift can either be outward or inward .",
    "the occurrence of type  iii migration with varying the planet mass , the disc s mass , aspect ratio , and viscosity was discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "the typical migration timescale associated with type iii migration , which depends on the disc mass @xcite , is of the order of a few horseshoe libration times . for the large planetary masses prone to type iii migration , which have wide horseshoe regions hence short libration times ,",
    "this typically amounts to a few tens of orbits .",
    "type  iii migration can in principle be outwards .",
    "for this to happen , an initial seed of outward drift needs to be applied to the planet @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , all outward episodes of type  iii migration reported so far have been found to stall and revert back to inward migration .",
    "interestingly , gravitationally unstable outer gap edges may provide a seed of outward type  iii migration and can bring massive planets to large orbital distances @xcite .",
    "an alternative launching mechanism for outward type  iii migration is the outward migration of a resonantly locked pair of giant planets ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also section  [ sec : ms01 ] ) , which is found to trigger outwards runaways at larger time @xcite .",
    "the migration regime depends on how the coorbital mass deficit compares with the mass of the planet and its circumplanetary disc .",
    "it is thus important to describe correctly the build up of the circumplanetary material and the effects of this mass on the dynamics of the gas and planet .",
    "@xcite find , using a nested grid code , that the mass reached by the cpd depends heavily on the resolution for an isothermal equation of state .",
    "@xcite circumvent this problem by adopting an equation of state that not only depends on the distance to the star , but also on the distance to the planet , in order to prevent an artificial flood of the cpd , and to obtain numerical convergence at high resolution .",
    "furthermore , as we have seen in section  [ sec : cpd ] , in simulations that discard self - gravity , the torque exerted on the planet should exclude the circumplanetary disc .",
    "@xcite find indeed that taking that torque into account may inhibit type  iii migration .",
    "type  iii migration has allowed to rule out a recent model of the solar nebula @xcite , more compact than the standard model of @xcite .",
    "indeed , @xcite has shown that jupiter would be subject to type  iii migration in desch s model and would not survive over the disc s lifetime .",
    "the occurrence of type  iii migration may thus provide an upper limit to the surface density of the disc models in systems known to harbor giant planets at sizable distances from their host stars .",
    "it has been pointed out above that the exact expression of the coorbital mass deficit involves the inverse vortensity rather than the surface density across the horseshoe region .",
    "this has some importance in low - viscosity discs : vortensity can be regarded as materially conserved except during the passage through the shocks triggered by a giant planet , where vortensity is gained or destroyed .",
    "the corresponding vortensity perturbation can be evaluated analytically @xcite .",
    "eventually , the radial vortensity distribution around a giant planet exhibits a characteristic two - ring structure on the edges of the gap , which is unstable @xcite and prone to the formation of vortices @xcite .",
    "the resulting vortensity profile determines the occurrence of type  iii migration .",
    "if vortices form at the gap edges , the planet can undergo non - smooth migration with episodes of type  iii migration that bring the planet inwards over a few hill radii ( a distance that is independent of the disc mass ) , followed by a stalling and a rebuild of the vortensity rings @xcite .",
    "the above results have been obtained for fixed - mass planets . however , for the high gas densities required by the type iii migration regime , rapid growth may be expected . using 3d hydrodynamical simulations with simple prescriptions for gas accretion ,",
    "@xcite find that a planetary core undergoing rapid runaway gas accretion does not experience type  iii migration , but goes instead from the type  i to the type  ii migration regime .",
    "future progress will be made using more realistic accretion rates , like those obtained with 3d radiation - hydrodynamics calculations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it has been shown that type  i migration in adiabatic discs could feature a kind of feedback reminiscent of type  iii migration .",
    "the reason is that in adiabatic discs , the corotation torque depends on the position of the stagnation point relative to the planet ( see section  [ sec : coro ] ) .",
    "this position , in turn , depends on the migration rate , so that there is here as well a feedback of the coorbital dynamics on migration .",
    "@xcite found that this feedback on type  i migration is negative , and that is has only a marginal impact on the drift rate for typical disc masses .",
    "so far , we have examined the orbital evolution of a single planet in a protoplanetary disc , while about @xmath108 of confirmed exoplanets reside in multi - planetary systems ( see exoplanets.org ) . in such systems ,",
    "the gravitational interaction between planets can significantly influence the planet orbits , leading , in particular , to important resonant processes which we describe below .",
    "a fair number of multi - planetary systems is known to have at least two planets in mean - motion resonance .",
    "@xcite list for example 32 resonant or near - resonant systems , with many additional kepler candidate systems .",
    "the mere existence of these resonant systems is strong evidence that dissipative mechanisms changing planet semi - major axes must have operated .",
    "the probability of forming resonant configurations in situ is likely small ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we consider a system of two planets that undergo migration in their disc .",
    "if the migration drift rates are such that the mutual separation between the planets increases , i.e. when divergent migration occurs , the effects of planet - planet interactions are small and no resonant capture occurs .",
    "conversely , resonant capture occurs for convergent migration under quite general conditions , which we discuss below .",
    "planets can approach each other from widely separated orbits if they have fairly different migration rates , or if they form in close proximity and are sufficiently massive to carve a common gap ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : multi - planet ] ) . in the latter case",
    ", the outer disc pushes the outer planet inwards , the inner disc pushes the inner planet outwards , causing convergence .",
    "if the planets approach a commensurability , where the orbital periods are the ratio of two integers , orbital eccentricities will be excited and resonant capture may occur . whether or not resonant capture occurs hinges primarily on the time the planets take to cross the resonance .",
    "capture requires the convergent migration timescale to be longer than the libration timescale associated with the resonance width .",
    "otherwise , the two - planet system does not have enough time for the resonance to be excited : the two planets will pass through the resonance and no capture will occur ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "due to the sensitivity of the resonant capture to the migration process , the interpretation of observed resonant planetary systems provides important clues about the efficiency of disc - planets interactions .",
    "a mean - motion resonance between two planets occurs when their orbital frequencies satisfy @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the angular velocity of the two planets , and where subscripts 1 and 2 refer to quantities of the inner and outer planets , respectively . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : resonance ] ) , @xmath15 and @xmath17 are positive integers , and @xmath15 denotes the order of the resonance . the above condition for a mean - motion resonance can be recast in terms of the planets semi - major axes , @xmath111 , as @xmath112 formally , a system is said to be in a @xmath113:@xmath17 mean - motion resonance if at least one of the resonant angles is librating , i.e. has a dynamical range smaller than @xmath114 .",
    "the resonant angles ( @xmath115 ) are defined as @xmath116 where @xmath117 denotes the planets longitude , and @xmath118 the longitude of their pericentre .",
    "the difference in pericentre longitudes is often used to characterise resonant behaviour .",
    "for instance , when that quantity librates , the system is said to be in apsidal corotation .",
    "this means that the two apsidal lines of the resonant planets are always nearly aligned , or maintain a constant angle between them .",
    "this is the configuration that the planets end up with when they continue their inward migration after capture in resonance ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "several bodies in our solar system are in mean - motion resonance .",
    "for example , the jovian satellites io , europa and ganymede are engaged in a so - called @xmath119:@xmath120:@xmath121 laplace resonance , while neptune and pluto ( as well as the plutinos ) are in a @xmath122:@xmath120 mean - motion resonance . however , out of the 8 planets in the solar system , not a single pair is presently in a mean - motion resonance . according to the nice model for the early solar system ,",
    "this might have been different in the past ( see section  [ sec : type2ei ] ) .",
    "the question of which resonance the system may end up in depends on the mass , the relative migration speed , and the initial separation of the planets @xcite . because the 2:1 resonance ( @xmath123 ) is the first first - order resonance that two initially well - separated planets encounter during convergent migration , it is common for planets to become locked in that resonance , provided convergent migration is not too rapid .    after a resonant capture , the eccentricities increase and the planets generally migrate as a joint pair , maintaining a constant orbital period ratio ( see , however , the last two paragraphs in section  [ sec : johnlow ] ) . continued migration in resonance drives the eccentricities up , and they would increase to very large values in the absence of damping agents , possibly rendering the system unstable . the eccentricity damping rate by the disc , @xmath124 , is often parametrized in terms of the migration rate @xmath125 as @xmath126 with @xmath127 a dimensionless constant . for low - mass planets ,",

    "high - mass planets create gaps in their disc ( see section  [ sec : type2 ] ) and the eccentricity damping is then strongly reduced . for the massive planets in the gj  876 planetary system , the three - body integrations of @xcite , in which migration",
    "is applied to the outer planet only , showed that @xmath130 can reproduce the observed eccentricities . if massive planets orbit in a common gap , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : multi - planet ] , the disc parts on each side of the gap may act as damping agents , and it was shown by the 2d hydrodynamical simulations of @xcite that such configuration gives @xmath131 510 .    disc turbulence adds a stochastic component to convergent migration , which may prevent resonant capture or maintenance of a resonant configuration .",

    "after the planets reached their observed semi - major axis , a theoretical rv - curve was calculated .",
    "surprisingly , even though the simulated eccentricities ( @xmath136 ) differ significantly from the data fits , the theoretical model fits the observed data points as well as the published best fit solution .",
    "the pronounced dynamical differences between the two orbital fits , which both match the existing data , can only be resolved with more observations .",
    "hence , hd  45364 serves as an excellent example of a system in which a greater quantity and quality of data will constrain theoretical models of this interacting multi - planetary system .",
    "another interesting observational aspect where convergent migration due to disc - planets interactions may have played a prominent role is the high mean eccentricity of extrasolar planets ( @xmath137 ) . as discussed above , for single planets , disc - planet interactions",

    "strong eccentricity excitation may occur , however , during convergent migration and resonant capture of two planets .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "strong eccentricity damping allows these systems to remain stable during their migration . in general terms ,",
    "these simulated systems are reminiscent of the low - mass planet systems discovered by the kepler mission , like kepler-11 @xcite .",
    "the proximity of the planets to the star in that system , and their near coplanarity , hints strongly toward a scenario of planet formation and migration in a gaseous protoplanetary disc .",
    "@xcite have shown that a pair of close giant planets can migrate outwards . in this scenario ,",
    "the inner planet is massive enough to open a deep gap around its orbit and undergoes type ii migration .",
    "the outer , less massive planet opens a partial gap and migrates inwards faster than the inner planet .",
    "if convergent migration is rapid enough for the planets to cross the 2:1 mean - motion resonance , and to lock in the 3:2 resonance , the planets will merge their gap and start migrating outwards together .",
    "the inner planet being more massive than the outer one , the ( positive ) torque exerted by the inner disc is larger than the ( negative ) torque exerted by the outer disc , which results in the planet pair moving outwards .",
    "note that to maintain joint outward migration on the long term , gas in the outer disc has to be funnelled to the inner disc upon embarking onto horseshoe trajectories relative to the planet pair .",
    "otherwise , gas would pile up at the outer edge of the common gap , much like a snow - plough , and the torque balance as well as the direction of migration would ultimately reverse .",
    "the above mechanism of joint outward migration of a resonant planet pair relies on an asymmetric density profile across the common gap around the two planets .",
    "this mechanism is therefore sensitive to the disc s aspect ratio , viscosity , and to the mass ratio between the two planets , since they all impact the density profile within and near the common gap .",
    "if , for instance , the outer planet is too small , the disc density beyond the inner planet s orbit will be too large to reverse the migration of the inner planet ( and , thus , of the planet pair ) .",
    "conversely , if the outer planet is too big , the torque imbalance on each side of the common gap will favour joint inward migration .",
    "numerical simulations by @xcite showed that joint outward migration works best when the mass ratio between the inner and outer planets is comparable to that of jupiter and saturn .",
    "in particular , @xcite found that the jupiter - saturn pair could avoid inward migration and stay beyond the ice line during the gas disc phase .",
    "their migration rate depends on the disc properties , but could be close to stationary for standard values .",
    "more recently , @xcite have proposed that jupiter first migrated inwards in the primordial solar nebula down to @xmath96 1.5 au , where saturn caught it up .",
    "near that location , after jupiter and saturn have merged their gap and locked into the 3:2 mean - motion resonance , both planets would have initiated joint outward migration until the primordial nebula dispersed .",
    "this scenario is known as _ the grand tack _ , and seems to explain the small mass of mars and the distribution of the main asteroid belt .",
    "the previous section has reviewed basics of , and recent progress on planet - disc interactions .",
    "we continue in this section with a discussion on the role played by planet - disc interactions in the properties and architecture of observed planetary systems .",
    "section  [ sec : short ] starts with planets on short - period orbits .",
    "emphasis is put on hot jupiters , including those with large spin - orbit misalignments ( section  [ sec : johngiant ] ) , and on the many low - mass candidate systems uncovered by the kepler mission ( section  [ sec : johnlow ] ) .",
    "section  [ sec : long ] then examines how planet - disc interactions could account for the massive planets recently observed at large orbital separations by direct imaging techniques .",
    "finally , section  [ sect : migrat - obs ] addresses how well global models of planet formation and migration can reproduce the statistical properties of exoplanets .",
    "the discovery of 51 pegasi b @xcite on a close - in orbit of @xmath140 days as the first example of a hot jupiter led to the general view that giant planets , which are believed to have formed beyond the ice line at @xmath141 au , must have migrated inwards to their present locations .",
    "possible mechanisms for this include type ii migration ( see section  [ sec : type2 ] ) and either planet - planet scattering , or kozai oscillations induced by a distant companion leading to a highly eccentric orbit which is then circularized as a result of tidal interaction with the central star ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the relative importance of these mechanisms is a matter of continuing debate .",
    "the relationship between planet mass and orbital period for confirmed exoplanets on short - period orbits is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : jp1 ] .",
    "the hot jupiters are seen to be clustered in circular orbits at periods in the range @xmath142 days .",
    "for planet masses in the range @xmath143 jupiter masses , there is no corresponding clustering of orbital periods , indicating that this is indeed a feature associated with hot jupiters .",
    "measurements of the rossiter - mclaughlin effect ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicate that around one third of hot jupiters orbit in planes that are significantly misaligned with the equatorial plane of the central star .",
    "this is not expected from disc - planet interactions leading to type ii migration , and so has led to the alternative mechanisms being favoured .",
    "thus @xcite propose that hot jupiters are placed in an isotropic distribution through dynamical interactions , and are then circularized by tides , with disc - driven migration playing a negligible role .",
    "they account for the large fraction of misaligned hot jupiters around stars with effective temperatures @xmath144  k , and the large fraction of aligned hot jupiters around cooler stars , as being due to a very large increase in the effectiveness of the tidal processes causing alignment for the cooler stars .    however , there are a number of indications that the process of hot jupiter formation does not work in this way , and that a more gentle process such as disc - driven migration has operated on the distribution .",
    "we begin by remarking the presence of significant eccentricities for periods @xmath145 days in fig .",
    "[ fig : jp1 ] .",
    "the period range over which tidal effects can circularize the orbits is thus very limited .",
    "giant planets on circular orbits with periods greater than 10 days , which are interior to the ice line , must have been placed there by a different mechanism .",
    "for example , 55 cnc b , a 0.8 @xmath146 planet on a 14 day , near - circular orbit exterior to hot super - earth 55 cnc e @xcite is a good case for type ii migration having operated on that system .",
    "there is no reason to suppose that a smooth delivery of hot jupiters through type ii migration would not function at shorter periods .",
    "there are also issues with the effectiveness of the tidal process ( see * ? ? ?",
    "it has to align inclined circular orbits without producing inspiral into the central star . to avoid the latter , the components of the tidal potential that act with non - zero forcing frequency in an inertial frame when the star does not rotate , have to be ineffective .",
    "instead one has to rely on components that appear to be stationary in this limit .",
    "these have a frequency that is a multiple of the stellar rotation frequency , expected to be significantly less than the orbital frequency , as viewed from the star when it rotates . as such components depend only on the time averaged orbit , they are insensitive to the sense of rotation in the orbit .",
    "accordingly there is a symmetry between prograde and retrograde aligning orbits with respect to the stellar equatorial plane .",
    "this is a strict symmetry when the angular momentum content of the star is negligible compared to that of the orbit , otherwise there is a small asymmetry ( see * ? ? ?",
    "notably , a significant population of retrograde orbits with aligned orbital planes , that is expected in this scenario , is not observed .",
    "@xcite have recently examined the dependence of the relationship between mass and orbital period on the metallicity of the central star .",
    "they find that the pile up for orbital periods in the range @xmath142 days characteristic of hot jupiters is only seen at high metallicity .",
    "in addition , high eccentricities , possibly indicative of dynamical interactions , are also predominantly seen at high metallicity .",
    "this indicates multi - planet systems in which dynamical interactions leading to close orbiters occur at high metallicity , and that disc - driven migration is favoured at low metallicity .",
    "finally , misalignments between stellar equators and orbital planes may not require strong dynamical interactions .",
    "several mechanisms may produce misalignments between the protoplanetary disc and the equatorial plane of its host star ( see section  [ sec : type2ei ] ) .",
    "another possibility is that internal processes within the star , such as the propagation of gravity waves in hot stars , lead to different directions of the angular momentum vector in the central and surface regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the kepler mission has discovered tightly packed planetary systems orbiting close to their star .",
    "several have been determined to be accurately coplanar , which is a signature of having formed in a gaseous disc .",
    "these include koi 94 and koi 25 @xcite , koi 30 @xcite , and kepler 50 and kepler 55 @xcite .",
    "we remark that if one supposed that formation through in situ gas free accumulation had taken place , for planets of a fixed type , the formation time scale would be proportional to the product of the local orbital period and the reciprocal of the surface density of the material making up the planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for a fixed mass this is proportional to @xmath147 . scaling from the inner solar system , where this time scale is taken to be @xmath148 yr @xcite",
    ", it becomes @xmath149 yr for @xmath150 au .",
    "note that this time scale is even shorter for more massive and more compact systems .",
    "this points to a possible formation during the disc lifetime , although the formation process should be slower and quieter in a disc , as protoplanets are constrained to be in non - overlapping near circular orbits . under this circumstance ,",
    "disc - planet interactions can not be ignored .",
    "notably , @xcite found that a significant number of kepler multiplanet candidate systems contain pairs that are close to first - order resonances .",
    "they also found a few multi - resonant configurations .",
    "an example is the four planet system koi-730 which exhibits the mean motion ratios 8:6:4:3 .",
    "more recently , @xcite confirmed the kepler 60 system which has three planets with the inner pair in a 5:4 commensurability and the outer pair in a 4:3 commensurability .",
    "however , most of the tightly packed candidate systems are non - resonant .",
    "the period ratio histogram for all pairs of confirmed exoplanet systems is shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : jp3 ] .",
    "this shows prominent spikes near the main first - order resonances .",
    "however , this trend is biased because many of the kepler systems were validated through observing transit timing variations , which are prominent for systems near resonances",
    ". the lower panel of this figure shows the same histogram for kepler candidate systems announced at the time of writing ( quarters 1 - 8 ) . in this case , although there is some clustering in the neighbourhood of the 3:2 commensurability and an absence of systems at exact 2:1 commensurability , with there being an overall tendency for systems to have period ratios slightly larger than exact resonant values , there are many non resonant systems .    at first sight",
    ", this appears to be inconsistent with results from the simplest theories of disc - planet interactions , for which convergent migration is predicted to form either resonant pairs @xcite or resonant chains @xcite .",
    "however , there are features not envisaged in that modelling which could modify these results , which we briefly discuss below .",
    "these fall into two categories : ( i ) those operating while the disc is still present , and ( ii ) those operating after the disc has dispersed .",
    "an example of the latter type is the operation of tidal interactions with the central star , which can cause two planet systems to increase their period ratios away from resonant values @xcite .",
    "however , this can not be the only process operating as fig .",
    "[ fig : jp3 ] shows that the same period ratio structure is obtained for periods both less than and greater than @xmath151 days .",
    "we also note that compact systems with a large number of planets can be close to dynamical instability through the operation of arnold diffusion ( see , e.g. , the analysis of kepler 11 by * ? ? ?",
    "thus it is possible that memory of the early history of multi - planet systems is absent from their current configurations .",
    "when the disc is present , stochastic forcing due to the presence of turbulence could ultimately cause systems to diffuse out of resonance ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "when this operates , resonances may be broken and period ratios may both increase and decrease away from resonant values .",
    "@xcite employed stochastic fluctuations in order to enable lower order resonances to be diffused through under slow convergent migration . in this way , they could form a 7:6 commensurability in their modelling of the kepler 36 system .",
    "another mechanism that could potentially prevent the formation of resonances in a disc involves the influence of each planet s wakes on other planets .",
    "the dissipation induced by the wake of a planet in the coorbital region of another planet causes the latter to be effectively repelled .",
    "this repulsion might either prevent the formation of resonances , or result in an increase in the period ratio from a resonant value .",
    "@xcite considered a @xmath152 super - earth migrating in a disc towards a giant planet .",
    "the upper panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : jp2 ] shows the time evolution of the super - earth s semi - major axis when orbiting exterior to a planet of one jupiter or two jupiter masses .",
    "we see that the super - earth s semi - major axis attains a minimum and ultimately increases . thus a resonance is not maintained .",
    "the lower panel shows the disc s surface density at one illustrative time : the super - earth ( grey arrow ) feels a head wind from the outer wake of the hot jupiter , which leads to the super earth being progressively repelled .",
    "this mechanism could account for the observed scarcity of super - earths on near - resonant orbits exterior to hot jupiters .",
    "a similar effect was found in disc - planets simulations with two partial gap - opening planets by @xcite .",

    "the inset panel shows a density contour plot where the interaction of the planets with each other s wakes is clearly seen",

    "these results show circumstances where convergent migration followed by attainment of stable strict commensurability may not be an automatic consequence of disc - planet interactions .",

    "more than half of the confirmed multiple planets having a lower mass estimate are more massive than saturn , which indicates that the formation of several giant planets in a protoplanetary disc should be quite common .",
    "smooth convergent migration of two giant planets in their parent disc should lead to resonant capture followed by joint migration of the planet pair ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "dispersal of the gas disc may trigger the onset of dynamical instability , with close encounters causing one of the two planets to be scattered to large orbital separations @xcite . a system of three giant planets is more prone to dynamical instability , and disc - driven convergent migration of three giant planets may induce planet scattering even in quite massive protoplanetary discs @xcite .",
    "planet scattering before or after disc dispersal could thus be a relevant channel for delivering one or several massive planets to orbital separations comparable to the cold jupiters. it could also account for the observed free - floating planets .",
    "giant planets could also form after the fragmentation of massive protoplanetary discs into clumps through the gravitational instability ( gi ) .",

    "first , gi - formed planets are unlikely to stay in place in their gravito - turbulent disc .",

    "the rapid inward migration of gi - formed planets could then slow down or even stall , possibly accompanied by the formation of a gap around the planet s orbit .",
    "gap - opening may also occur if significant gas accretion occurs during the initial stage of rapid migration @xcite , which may promote the survival of inwardly migrating clumps .",
    "planet interactions , which may result in scattering events , mergers , or resonant captures in a disc , should also play a prominent role in shaping planetary systems formed by gi .",
    "the near resonant architecture of the hr  8799 planet system could point to resonant captures after convergent migration in a gravito - turbulent disc .",
    "furthermore , gas clumps progressively contract as they cool down . as",
    "clumps initially migrate inwards , they may experience some tidal disruption , a process known as tidal downsizing .",
    "this process could deliver a variety of planet masses in the inner parts of protoplanetary discs @xcite .",
    "all of the disc - driven migration scenarios discussed in this review have some dependence on the planet mass , so it is necessary to consider the combined effects of mass growth and migration when assessing the influence of migration on the formation of planetary systems .",
    "two approaches that have been used extensively for this purpose are planetary population synthesis and n - body simulations , both of which incorporate prescriptions for migration .",
    "population synthesis studies use monte - carlo techniques to construct synthetic planetary populations , with the aim of determining which combinations of model ingredients lead to statistically good fits to the observational data . in principle",

    "input variables that form the basis of the monte - carlo approach include initial gas disc masses , gas - to - dust ratios , and disc photoevaporation rates , constrained by observational data .",
    "the advantages of population synthesis studies lie in their computational speed and ability to include a broad range of physical processes .",
    "this allows the models to treat elements of the physics ( such as gas envelope accretion , or ablation of planetesimals as they pass through the planet envelope , for example ) much more accurately than is possible in n - body simulations .",
    "a single realisation of a monte - carlo simulation consists of drawing a disc model from the predefined distribution of possibilities and introducing a single low - mass planetary embryo in the disc at a random location within a predefined interval in radius",
    ". accretion of planetesimals then proceeds , followed by gas envelope settling as the core mass grows . runaway gas accretion to form a gas giant may occur if the core mass reaches the critical value .",
    "further implementation details are provided in the chapter on planetary population synthesis by benz et al . in this volume .",
    "the main advantages of the n - body approach are that they automatically include an accurate treatment of planet - planet interactions that is normally missing from the ` single - planet - in - a - disc ' monte - carlo models , they capture the competitive accretion that is inherently present in the oligarchic picture of early planet formation , and they incorporate giant impacts between embryos that are believed to provide the crucial last step in terrestrial planet formation . at present , however , gas accretion has been ignored or treated in a crude manner in n - body models . as such",

    "models presented in @xcite , for example , fail to produce giant planets at all if full - strength type  i migration operates . statistically acceptable",
    "giant planet populations are reported for reductions in the efficiency of type  i migration by factors of 0.01 to 0.03 , with type  ii migration being required to form ` hot jupiters ' . with the type  ii time scale of @xmath163 yr being significantly shorter than disc life times , numerous giant planets migrate into the central star in these models .",
    "the survivors are planets that form late as the disc is being dispersed ( through viscous evolution and photoevaporation ) , but just early enough to accrete appreciable gaseous envelopes .",

    "these models considered an initial population of planetary embryos undergoing oligarchic growth extending out to 30 au from the star , and indicate that the right combination of planetary growth times , disc masses and life times can form surviving giant planets through the core - accretion model , provided embryos can form and grow at rather large orbital distances before migrating inward .",
    "the role of the combined vorticity- and entropy - related corotation torque , and its ability to slow or reverse type  i migration of forming planets , has not yet been explored in detail .",
    "the survival of protoplanets with masses in the range @xmath171 m@xmath164 in global 1d disc models has been studied by @xcite .",
    "these models demonstrate the existence of locations in the disc where planets of a given mass experience zero migration due to the cancellation of lindblad and corotation torques ( zero - migration radii or planetary migration traps ) .",
    "planets have a tendency to migrate toward these positions , where they then sit and drift inward slowly as the gas disc disperses .",
    "preliminary results of population synthesis calculations have been presented by @xcite , and n - body simulations that examine the oligarchic growth scenario under the influence of strong corotation torques have been presented by @xcite .",
    "these studies indicate that the convergent migration that arises as planets move toward their zero - migration radii can allow a substantial increase in the rate of planetary accretion . under conditions where the disc hosts a strongly decreasing temperature gradient , @xcite computed models that led to outward migration of planetary embryos to radii @xmath172 au , followed by gas accretion that formed gas giants at these large distances from the star .",
    "the temperature profiles required for this were substantially steeper than those that arise from calculations of passively heated discs , however , so it remains to be determined whether these conditions can ever be realised in a protoplanetary disc .",
    "following on from the study of corotation torques experienced by planets on eccentric orbits by @xcite , @xcite incorporated a prescription for this effect and found that planet - planet scattering causes eccentricity growth to values that effectively quench the horseshoe drag , such that crowded planetary systems during the formation epoch may continue to experience rapid inward migration .",
    "further work is clearly required to fully assess the influence of the corotation torque on planet formation in the presence of significant planet - planet interactions .",
    "looking to the future , it is clear that progress in making accurate theoretical predictions that apply across the full range of observed exoplanet masses will be best achieved by bringing together the best elements of the population synthesis and n - body approaches .",
    "some key issues that require particular attention include the structure of the disc close to the star , given its influence in shaping the short - period planet population ( see section  [ sec : short ] ) .",
    "this will require developments in both observation and theory to constrain the nature of the magnetospheric cavity and its influence on the migration of planets of all masses .",
    "significant improvements in underlying global disc models are also required , given the sensitivity of migration processes to the detailed disc physics .",
    "particular issues at play are the roles of magnetic fields , the thermal evolution and the nature of the turbulent flow in discs that sets the level of the effective viscous stress .",
    "these are all active areas of research at the present time and promise to improve our understanding of planet formation processes in the coming years .",
    "the main points to take away from this chapter are summarized below :    * disc - planet interactions are a natural process that inevitably operates during the early evolution of planetary systems , when planets are still embedded in their protoplanetary disc .",
    "they modify all orbital elements of a planet . while eccentricity and inclination are usually damped quickly , the semi - major axis may increase or decrease more or less rapidly depending on the planet - to - star mass ratio ( @xmath15 ) and the disc s physical properties ( including its aspect ratio @xmath41 ) . *",
    "planet migration comes in three main flavors .",
    "( i ) type i migration applies to low - mass planets ( @xmath173 , which is the case if @xmath174 ) that do not open a gap around their orbit .",
    "its direction ( inwards or outwards ) and speed are very sensitive to the structure of the disc , its radiative and turbulent properties in a narrow region around the planet .",
    "while major progress in understanding the physics of type  i migration has been made since ppv , robust predictions of its direction and pace will require more knowledge of protoplanetary discs in regions of planet formation .",
    "alma should bring precious constraints in that sense .",
    "( ii ) type ii migration is for massive planets ( @xmath175 , or @xmath176 given by eq .",
    "[ eq : qcrit ] ) that carve a deep gap around their orbit .",
    "type  ii migrating planets drift inwards in a time scale comparable to or longer than the disc s viscous time scale at their orbital separation .",
    "( iii ) type iii migration concerns intermediate - mass planets ( @xmath155 ) that open a partial gap around their orbit .",
    "this very rapid , preferentially inward migration regime operates in massive discs . *",
    "planet - disc interaction is one major ingredient for shaping the architecture of planetary systems .",
    "the diversity of migration paths predicted for low - mass planets probably contributes to the diversity in the mass - semi - major axis diagram of observed exoplanets .",
    "convergent migration of several planets in a disc could provide the conditions for exciting planets eccentricity and inclination . *",
    "the distribution of spin - orbit misalignments amongst hot jupiters is very unlikely to have an explanation based on a single scenario for the large - scale inward migration required to bring them to their current orbital separations .",
    "hot jupiters on orbits aligned with their central star point preferentially to a smooth disc delivery , via type ii migration , rather than to dynamical interactions with a planetary or a stellar companion , followed by star - planet tidal re - alignment .",
    "* convergent migration of two planets in a disc does not necessarily result in the planets being in mean - motion resonance .",
    "turbulence in the disc , the interaction between a planet and the wake of its companion , or late star - planet tidal interactions , could explain why many multi - planet candidate systems discovered by the kepler mission are near- or non - resonant .",
    "wake - planet interactions could account for the observed scarcity of super - earths on near - resonant orbits exterior to hot jupiters .",
    "* recent observations of circumstellar discs have reported the existence of cavities and of large - scale vortices in millimetre - sized grains .",
    "these features do not necessarily track the presence of a giant planet in the disc .",
    "it should be kept in mind that the gaps carved by planets of around a jupiter mass or less are narrow annuli , not cavities .",
    "* improving theories of planet - disc interactions in models of planet population synthesis is essential to make progress in understanding the statistical properties of exoplanets .",
    "current discrepancies between theory and observations point to uncertainties in planet migration models as much as to uncertainties in planet mass growth , the physical properties of protoplanetary discs , or to the expected significant impact of planet - planet interactions .    _ acknowledgments _ we thank cornelis dullemond and the anonymous referee for their constructive reports .",
