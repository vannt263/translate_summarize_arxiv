    "multiferroics , which simultaneously show spontaneous electric and magnetic ordering in a single phase @xcite , have attracted tremendous interest in recent years because of their potential applications in the field of spintronics such as information storage and sensors , and also because of their underlying fascinating fundamental physics @xcite .",
    "there are not many multiferroic materials in nature at room temperature ( rt ) , however , because of the rarity of the co - existence of the conventional cation off - center distortion mechanism of ferroelectrics and the formation of magnetic moments at the cation sites @xcite .",
    "bifeo@xmath0 ( bfo ) is such a rare case .",
    "however , the magnetic order in the cycloidal antiferromagnetic structure with a only tiny ferromagnetic component , due to spin canting , leads only to a weak magnetoelectric coupling @xcite .    in the case of thin films",
    ", it has been shown that heteroepitaxially strained bfo films are ferromagnetic at rt and show remarkably larger magnetoelectric effect @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported multiferroic behavior of strained bfo thin films with both large ferromagnetic and ferroelectric polarizations at rt .",
    "this suggests the potential of bfo thin films for device applications that exploit the large magnetoelectric coupling .",
    "recently , enhancement of the magnetization was reported for bife@xmath1co@xmath2o@xmath0 ( bfco ) thin films @xcite .",
    "some of the present authors have systematically studied the structural transition on bulk bfco samples as well as the ferroelectric and piezo electric properties of thin films fabricated by a chemical solution deposition ( csd ) method @xcite .    in order to investigate the mechanism of the magnetization enhancement by co doping , x - ray absorption spectroscopy",
    "( xas ) and magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) are powerful tools because they are element specific probes of the electronic and magnetic properties applicable to complex materials .",
    "several studies have utilized these techniques to examine the electronic and magnetic states of fe in bfo and its heterostructures @xcite .",
    "however , measurements of bfo films by singh",
    "_ @xcite and bea _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that the observed magnetic moment might be due to the formation of impurity phases such as the ferrimagnetic @xmath4-fe@xmath5o@xmath0 .",
    "the structure and properties of bulk single crystals of bfo have been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "the crystal have a rhombohedrally distorted perovskite structure ( a = b = c = 5.63  , @xmath6 = @xmath7 = @xmath4 = 59.4@xmath8 ) at rt . the distorted perovskite - type bfo is both ferroelectric ( @xmath9 @xmath101103 k ) and antiferromagnetic ( @xmath11 @xmath10 643 k ) at rt , and exhibits weak ferromagnetism because of the canted spin structure @xcite .",
    "the magnetic structure is nearly @xmath12-type , i.e. , the fe magnetic moments are coupled ferromagnetically within the pseudocubic ( 111 ) plane and antiferromagnetically between adjacent planes with an additional incommensurate spin modulation prohibiting the linear magnetoelectric effect from being observed @xcite .",
    "it has also been predicted that spontaneous magnetization can be induced in bfo by mixed valence or chemical substitution either changing the fe - o - fe bond angle or a statistical distortion of the feo@xmath13 octahedra@xcite .",
    "bicoo@xmath0 ( bco ) also exhibits high transition temperatures above rt with respect to both magnetism and ferroelectricity .",
    "bco exists as a high pressure phase and can be synthesized under a high pressure of 6 gpa @xcite .",
    "it has a tetragonal structure with a large c / a ratio of 1.29 .",
    "the spontaneous polarization is calculated to be 150 @xmath14c/@xmath15 but no transition to paraelectric phase is observed below the decomposition temperature , and the neel temperature is 473 k @xcite .    in the present paper , we have performed xas and xmcd studies of the composition dependence of the electronic and magnetic properties of bfco thin films grown on single - crystal laalo@xmath0 ( lao ) ( 001 ) substrates using the csd method .",
    "based on the experimental results , we shall discuss the origin of ferromagnetism in the bfco thin films .",
    "bfco thin films were grown on lao ( 001 ) substrates using the csd technique .",
    "the substrates were spin - coated ( at 4000 rpm for 30 s ) using a solution containing bi , co , and fe organometallic compounds ( koujundo chemical laboratory co. , ltd . ) in a xylene carrier in the desired ratio at a concentration of 0.2 mol / kg .",
    "the samples were then heated in air at 250@xmath8c for 5 min . repeating this coating - heating sequence 13 times yielded bfco films that were about 260 nm thick .",
    "after the films were annealed for 60 min in a 5% ozone - oxygen mixture in a tube furnace at 420@xmath8c , the bfco / lao(001 ) samples were subject to again annealing at 435@xmath8c for 30 min to improve their crystallinity .",
    "the stoichiometry was confirmed by hrtem@xmath16edx and was almost constant within the deviation of @xmath171.0% @xcite .",
    "structural characterization was carried out using x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) , which demonstrated a clear single phase @xcite .",
    "the xrd measurements confirmed that , as the co content increases , bfco turns from rhombohedral ( r ) to tetragonal - like monoclinic crystal structures ( t ) and both phases ( r and t ) coexist for co content between @xmath18 = 0.10 and 0.20 .",
    "the xas and xmcd measurements were performed at the jaea undulator beam line bl-23su of spring-8 .",
    "the measurements were performed at rt in an applied magnetic field up to @xmath17 3 t .",
    "the propagation vector of light with circular polarization was parallel to the magnetic field and incident perpendicular to the sample surface .",
    "the spectra were collected in the total electron yield ( tey ) mode , which has a probing depth of @xmath105 nm . the monochromator resolution was _",

    "2(b ) shows that the xmcd spectra change their line shapes with co content .",
    "the negative peaks due to fe@xmath3 at the @xmath27 site increases more rapidly than the positive peak due to fe@xmath3 at the @xmath28 site . in order to see how the xmcd line shape changes with composition , we have plotted the height of the negative peak c [ due to fe@xmath33(@xmath27 ) ] and the positive peak b [ due to fe@xmath3(@xmath28 ) ] in fig .",
    "the plot indicates that , for low co content ( @xmath34 0.15 ) , the height of the @xmath28 peak is as large as that of the @xmath27 peak , while it decreases above @xmath18 = 0.20 .",
    "we have therefore decomposed the measured fe 2@xmath23 xas and xmcd spectra into the spectrum of the @xmath4-fe@xmath5o@xmath0 -like impurity phase and that of the fe@xmath3 ion in the o@xmath35 crystal field of the bfco lattice , as plotted in fig.3(c ) .",

    "the plot indicates that the @xmath4-fe@xmath5o@xmath0-like phase is dominant for @xmath36 0.15 but starts to decrease for @xmath37 0.15 and the fe@xmath3 ion at the octahedral site becomes dominant for @xmath37 0.20 probably because the canting angle of the fe@xmath3 spins is increased with @xmath18 .",
    "our tem studies of the bfco films have suggested that for @xmath37 0.15 the tetragonal - like monoclinic phase exists only near the substrate and that the surface region of these films are dominated by the randomly oriented rhombohedral phase @xcite .",
    "the rhombohedral phase is responsible for the ferromagnetism through probably the increase of the canting angle of the fe@xmath3 spins with @xmath18 .",
    "however , the tetragonal - like monoclinic phase does not contribute to the magnetization @xcite .",

    "thus we conclude that the co ions in the bfco films are mainly in the trivalent high - spin states @xcite .",

    "the figure indicates that the co magnetic moment is smaller and approaches zero as the magnetic field goes to zero .",

    "the magnetization for @xmath18 = 0.15 and 0.20 is enhanced and a finite coercive field ( hc ) was observed however , the magnetization for @xmath37 0.20 decreases because of decreased @xmath4-fe@xmath5o@xmath0 . for bfo , a strong coupling between the ferroelectric 71@xmath8 and 109@xmath8 domains and the antiferromagnetic domains has been reported , and the anitiferromagnetic domains can be reversed by ferroelectric switching at rt @xcite .",
    "in analogy with the bfo result , the bfco films may potentially exhibit the magnetoelectric ( me ) effect with a change in the macroscopic magnetization because only rhombohedral domains exist for co concentration below @xmath18 = 0.20 .",
    "we have performed xas and the xmcd measurements of bfco thin films , which exhibit ferromagnetism at 300 k. from analysis of the line shapes and intensity of fe 2@xmath23 xmcd , we conclude that the ferromagnetism originates from both the @xmath4-fe@xmath5o@xmath0 impurity and the fe@xmath3 ions in the bfco lattice , and that the latter contribution becomes dominant for high co content @xmath37 0.2 , i.e. , in the tetragonal - like monoclinic crystal structure .",
    "the co ions are in the trivalent high - spin states and are most likely antiferromagnetic with weak magnetic moment due to spin canting induced by the applied magnetic field .",
    "the present results suggest that the co substitution enhance the ferromagnetic behavior of fe through the increased canting angle of the fe@xmath3 spins in the rhombohedral phase with increasing @xmath18 .",

    "<S> bifeo@xmath0 ( bfo ) shows both ferroelectricity and magnetic ordering at room temperature but its ferromagnetic component , which is due to spin canting , is negligible . </S>",
    "<S> substitution of transition - metal atoms such as co for fe is known to enhance the ferromagnetic component in bfo . in order to reveal the origin of such magnetization enhancement </S>",
    "<S> , we performed soft x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) and soft x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) studies of bife@xmath1co@xmath2o@xmath0 ( _ x _ = 0 to 0.30 ) ( bfco ) thin films grown on laalo@xmath0(001 ) substrates . </S>",
    "<S> the xas results indicated that the fe and co ions are in the fe@xmath3 and co@xmath3 states . </S>",
    "<S> the xmcd results showed that the fe ions show ferromagnetism while the co ions are antiferromagnetic at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the xas and xmcd measurements also revealed that part of the fe@xmath3 ions are tetrahedrally co - ordinated by oxygen ions but that the xmcd signals of the octahedrally coordinated fe@xmath3 ions increase with co content . </S>",
    "<S> the results suggest that an impurity phase such as the ferrimagnetic @xmath4-fe@xmath5o@xmath0 which exists at low co concentration decreases with increasing co concentration and that the ferromagnetic component of the fe@xmath3 ion in the octrahedral crystal fields increases with co concentration , probably reflecting the increased canting of the fe@xmath3 ions . </S>"
