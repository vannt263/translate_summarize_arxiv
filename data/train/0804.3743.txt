    "the cambridge sloan survey of wide arcs in the sky ( cassowary , see belokurov et al .",
    "2007 , 2008 ) has uncovered a number of examples of gravitational lensing by luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) .",
    "for example , the lens cassowary 2 has two very bright and massive lrgs at redshifts of @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively acting as lenses for a blue star - forming galaxy at @xmath2 .",
    "although the lrgs lie in a loose group , a natural starting point is that the lens is a close pair of galaxies .",
    "cassowary 5 has two early - type galaxies separated by @xmath3 on the sky acting as lenses .",
    "the three images of the high redshift source visible in the sloan digital sky survey data straddle the two lenses .",
    "cassowary s search strategy has proved adept at finding gravitational lenses with large separation images ( @xmath4 ) , which naturally enough are typically caused by two or lensing galaxies .",
    "there are also a number of existing strong lenses for which there appears to be more than one lensing galaxy  such as he 0230 - 213  @xcite , pmn j0134 - 0931  @xcite and b1359 + 154  @xcite .",
    "in fact , in roughly a quarter of all strong lenses , the lensing potential is known to be more complex than a single lensing galaxy , with usually a pair or group of galaxies being implicated .",
    "the only binary lens that has so far received detailed scrutiny is the important case of two point masses .",
    "@xcite carried out a detailed study of the caustics , critical curves and imaging properties . in particular , they showed that the simpler model of a point mass plus external shear @xcite is not always a reliable description of the lensing properties of binary point masses .",
    "given the importance of microlensing surveys for planets , there has been much subsequent theoretical work on the binary point mass case  ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the theory has borne fruit in detailed modelling of binary lens events , including the first microlens mass determinations  @xcite , and the discovery of the first neptune mass extra - solar planets  @xcite .    here",
    ", we provide a theoretical treatment of the problem of lensing by two isothermal spheres .",
    "the model has been considered numerically in @xcite , though primarily in the context of lensing in two planes at different redshifts .",
    "the motivation of our study is threefold .",
    "first , a binary galaxy model has a direct application to the close galaxy pair lenses found by the cassowary survey or to groups and clusters acting as lenses .",
    "second , the investigation of the properties of highly non - symmetric gravitational lenses is seriously incomplete , and so the model provides an interesting counterweight to the binary point mass case .",
    "third , in the case of binary singular isothermal spheres , many of the properties can be found analytically , giving insights that are not so easy to obtain using numerical work .",
    "the number of lenses for which analytic progress can be made is still very small .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : be - bcp - curves ] , we numerically examine the different possible critical curve topologies of two cored isothermal spheres .",
    "different image configurations are explored by considering the fermat surfaces in section  [ sec : be - imagegeometries ] , and section  [ sec : be - bsis ] deals with the special case of singular isothermal spheres , and derives a number of exact results .",
    "we use dimensionless source plane @xmath5 and lens plane coordinates @xmath6  ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the two isothermal spheres are centred at @xmath7 on the @xmath8-axis .",
    "the deflection potential is @xmath9^{1/2 } \\nonumber \\\\ & + & e_{2 } \\ : \\left [ \\rctwo^{2 } + ( x - a)^{2 } + y^{2 } \\right]^{1/2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the core radii of the isothermal spheres .",
    "if the core radii vanish , this reduces to the potential of two singular isothermal spheres with einstein radii @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "we take @xmath14 and @xmath15 without loss of generality .",
    "let us introduce @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "then the convergence is @xmath18 whilst the shear components are    [ eq : be - models - gamma - components ] @xmath19    the jacobian of the lens mapping may be found either from @xmath20\\left[1 - \\psiyy(\\vecx)\\right ] - \\psixy(\\vecx)^{2 } \\,,\\ ] ] or from @xmath21^{2 } - \\gamma(\\vecx)^{2}\\,,\\ ] ] where the magnitude of shear is @xmath22 for an isolated , singular isothermal sphere , @xmath23 and so we obtain the familiar result @xmath24 .",
    "the analogue of this in the binary , singular case is @xmath25 and so @xmath24 on the axis of two singular isothermal spheres .",
    "let us take as properties of a fiducial elliptical galaxy lens a velocity dispersion @xmath26 , a core radius @xmath27 , and a redshift @xmath28 .",
    "let us take the source redshift as @xmath29 , and use a @xmath30 concordance cosmology .",
    "as shown in @xcite , this choice of parameters is astrophysically reasonable .",
    "the corresponding dimensionless einstein radius is @xmath31 ( where the length scale is chosen to be @xmath32 ) .",
    "we place two such fiducial isothermal spheres at @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and numerically find critical curves and caustics for varying @xmath35 .",
    "the different possible configurations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : be - bcp - set - a ] .",

    "[ fig : be - bcp - set - a ] ) , the critical curves and caustics of the two lenses are disjoint , but the outer tangential critical curves are not circular ( as they would be for a single such lens in isolation ) and the corresponding caustics are distorted astroids with four cusps .",
    "there are small radial critical curves around each lens that map to large roundish caustics .",
    "we call this configuration of critical curves , and the corresponding caustic configuration , ` type 0 ' . for @xmath36 , the tangential critical curves have merged into a single outer critical curve ( which we call the common tangential critical curve ) , and the corresponding caustics have merged to form a single six - cusp caustic .",
    "we call this arrangement ` type 1 ' .",
    "the six - cusp caustic elongates along the @xmath37-axis as @xmath35 decreases further , and two small three - cusp caustics split off , as two small critical curves ( henceforth ` bean ' critical curves ) pinch off from the outermost critical curve , to leave a single four - cusp astroid caustic ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) .",
    "we call this ` type 2 '",
    ". the physical origin of the ` bean ' critical curves is explained later (   [ secsub : be - bsis - eucatastrophe ] ) in the context of singular isothermal spheres . at @xmath40",
    ", the three - cusp caustics have moved away from the origin and enlarged , whilst the ` bean ' critical curves have moved towards the origin and enlarged . decreasing @xmath35 still further",
    ", the two ` bean ' critical curves merge with the two radial critical curves , creating two critical curves around the origin ( bottom - most panels ) .",
    "the inner one maps to a caustic with two butterfly cusps , whilst the outer one maps to the outermost caustic .",
    "the outermost critical curve still corresponds to an astroid caustic around the origin .",
    "we call this configuration ` type 3b ' .      although there are five free parameters in ( [ eq : be - bcp - psi ] ) , the geometry of the critical curves and caustics are determined by four .",
    "this is most easily seen from the lens equation    [ eq : be - lensequation ] @xmath41 @xmath42.\\ ] ]    if all five parameters are scaled by @xmath43 , the new lens has the same critical curve and caustic geometry , just on a different scale : choosing new coordinates @xmath44 , @xmath45 reduces the new lens equation to the old one .",
    "the most physically interesting regime has @xmath46  that is , the separation between the two lensing galaxies is much larger than their core radii  whilst @xmath47 and @xmath35 are comparable .",
    "the scaling degeneracy means that it is only the ratios @xmath48 and @xmath49 that determine the geometry of the critical curves and caustics ( up to the effect of the core radii ) .",
    "so we fix @xmath35 ( to 10 , specifically ) , allow @xmath12 and @xmath13 to vary , and find which critical curve geometries arise from different parts of the @xmath12-@xmath13 parameter plane .",
    "since only small core radii are physical , we do not explore the @xmath10 and @xmath11 dimensions of parameter space much . for simplicity ,",
    "@xmath50 are set to scale with @xmath51 as @xmath52 respectively , so that a doubling of both @xmath53 corresponds , physically , to halving the separation @xmath54 between the lens galaxies .",
    "( the factor @xmath55 normalizes the core radii to the fiducial isothermal spheres . )",
    "we find that there are five possible critical curve topologies .",
    "there are the four seen in   [ secsub : be - ccs - twoidenticalspheres ] : type 0 ( disjoint tangential critical curves ) , type 1 ( a common tangential critical curve ) , type 2 ( a common tangential critical curve surrounding two ` bean ' critical curves in addition to the two radial critical curves ) , and type 3b ( the common tangential critical curve , and two other critical curves in a distorted annulus around the origin , with the galaxy centres lying within the edges of the annulus ) .",
    "in addition , there is a type 3a topology : unequal isothermal spheres mean that the two ` bean ' critical curves merge with one of the radial critical curves before the other .",
    "these five critical curve topologies are separated by four metamorphoses of critical curve geometry , as shown in figures  [ fig : be - bcp - metamorphosis-1 ] to  [ fig : be - bcp - metamorphosis-3b ] , which we call metamorphoses 1 , 2 , 3a and 3b . metamorphosis 1 marks the transition from type 0 to type 1 critical curves , and so on .",
    "recall when viewing these figures that @xmath53 are always dimensionless einstein radii ( in the same units as the axes ) and that the isothermal spheres are centred at @xmath56 on the @xmath8-axis .",
    "the metamorphoses of caustics occur at metamorphoses of the critical curves , except for the development of swallowtails in one of the caustics without any corresponding change in the topology of the critical curves : see fig .",
    "[ fig : be - bcp - swallowtail - met ] .",
    "( for the mathematical background to catastrophe theory , see e.g. , @xcite , whilst for an introduction to critical - curve and caustic metamorphoses , see e.g. @xcite . )",
    "so we also call caustics type 0 , 1 and so on if the critical curves are of that type . note , however , an astroid caustic can still pierce a radial caustic , for example , without the critical curve topology changing .",
    "but caustics do not merge or split unless the critical curves do .    in type 0 critical curves ,",
    "@xmath57 outside the tangential critical curves , and @xmath58 within them except for the small regions within the radial critical curves around the galaxy centres at @xmath59 .",
    "there is a saddle of @xmath60 on the @xmath8-axis , and as @xmath53 are increased , @xmath60 at the saddle decreases .",
    "as the saddle decreases through zero , the two regions of negative @xmath60 link up , forming type 1 critical curves ( metamorphosis 1 , fig  [ fig : be - bcp - metamorphosis-1 ] ) .",
    "the corresponding metamorphosis in the caustics is the merging of the two four - cusp astroids , via a ` beak - to - beak ' transition  ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "6 ) , into a six - cusped curve , which we henceforth call a ` hexacuspid ' .",
    "note also that the hexacuspid can pierce the radial caustics .",
    "as @xmath53 are increased further , the outer , common tangential critical curve loses its bottleneck , but eventually develops dimples around two small regions that have more positive @xmath60 than their surroundings ( these are regions where the shear is small : see   [ secsub : be - bsis - eucatastrophe ] ) .",
    "meanwhile , the hexacuspid becomes less elongated along the @xmath8-axis and more elongated in the @xmath37-axis .",

    "as expected , increasing the core radii mean that the mergers take place at smaller @xmath53 , as the radial critical curves enlarge ( reaching out towards the bean critical curves ) .",

    "only one image is produced if the source is outside all the caustics , and there are two extra images for each caustic within which the source lies .",
    "central images are usually highly demagnified and would not be observable , so some 3-image systems would appear as doublets ( e.g. 3a-1 in fig .  [",
    "fig : be - bcp - fs_3ims ] ) , some 5-image systems as quadruplets ( e.g. 5b-1 in fig .  [",

    "( we exclude cases where @xmath37 lies on a caustic , so there are no images at critical points . )",
    "now , @xmath75 looks like a concave - up paraboloid at large @xmath76 because @xmath77 ( or a constant ) , so level curves of @xmath75 must be closed . also , level curves can not cross except at saddle points .",
    "a fermat surface can therefore be classified by the topology of the level curves that run through saddles , the _",
    "critical isochrones _ , ( see e.g. @xcite   5.5 )",
    ". there are four ways to close the critical isochrones that run through a saddle , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : be - critiso - leli - diagrams ] , which we call le@xmath78 ( the lemniscates ) and li@xmath78 ( the limaons ) for short .",
    "we recall that if there are 3 , 5 or 7 images , there are 1 , 2 or 3 saddle points , respectively . for a given number of saddle points ,",
    "it is straightforward to count the number of possible critical isochrone topologies : it is a matter of counting the number of different ways in which limaons and lemniscates can be enclosed within one another consistently , assuming that @xmath79 for different saddle points @xmath80  ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "there are 2 possible topologies for 3-image geometries , 6 for 5-image geometries and 25 for 7-image geometries , but not all of these actually arise in a given lens model  @xcite .",
    "although there are many different possible topologies for the caustics ( types 0 to 3b , swallowtails , and different overlapping of caustics ) , that divide the source plane up into many different regions , there are only eight different critical isochrone topologies for the double isothermal sphere lens : two three - image cases , three five - image cases , and three seven - image cases .",
    "these are listed in table  [ tab : be - bcp - fermatsurface - topographies ] , and the possible five- and seven - image topologies are shown explicitly in fig .",
    "[ fig : be - bcp - fstopologydiagrams ] .",
    "we name them according to the shapes of the critical isochrones , starting from the outermost and working inwards ; the exact placement of the limaons and lemniscates follows implicitly .",
    "so , for example , li@xmath81 li@xmath81 le@xmath82 means that an outer limaon encloses an inner limaon ( and an li@xmath81 can only be put inside the minus region of the outer limaon ) , which in turn contains an innermost lemniscate ( which must be in the minus region of the inner limaon ) , whilst li@xmath81 le@xmath81 le@xmath82 means that there is a le@xmath81 in the plus region of the limaon and a le@xmath82 in the minus region ( since a le@xmath82 can not be enclosed within a le@xmath81 ) .",
    "for the same isochrone topology , image configurations can differ qualitatively , as listed in the second column of the table .",
    "so , for example , 7b-1 and 7b-2 are two distinct seven - image configurations corresponding to li@xmath81 le@xmath81 le@xmath82 . examples of qualitatively different image configurations are plotted in figs  [ fig : be - bcp - fs_3ims ] to [ fig : be - bcp - fs_7ims ] , with image positions superimposed on critical curves and fermat surfaces with critical isochrones .",
    "the galaxies are still always centred at @xmath83 in these figures , and the core radii @xmath84 are chosen as before .",
    "classifying image geometries by critical isochrone topology is of more than mathematical interest because it allows the order of arrival of images to be deduced ( in whole or in part ) .",
    "but , as the figures show , systems with the same critical isochrone topology can be very different : they can have a different number of core images ( as in examples 5c-1 and 5c-2 in fig .",
    "[ fig : be - bcp - fs_5ims ] ) , or the bright images may be positioned very differently ( e.g. 7b-1 and 7b-2 in fig .  [",
    "fig : be - bcp - fs_7ims ] ) , and , since fermat surfaces change smoothly with changing lens parameters and source position , two systems can have similar image positions but have different critical isochrone topologies . indeed , more than one critical isochrone topology is possible for sources in the same region of a given critical curve and caustic topology : for example , both the fermat topographies li@xmath81 li@xmath81 le@xmath82 ( e.g. 7a-1 ) and li@xmath81 le@xmath81 le@xmath82 ( e.g. 7b ) can arise from a type-1 caustic configuration with the source inside all three caustics ( not shown in figures ) .",
    "it is also possible to obtain the same critical isochrone topology and similar image positions for lenses with topologically distinct critical curves and caustics ( e.g. the two 7c-1 panels in fig .",
