    "such methods will be discussed in section 2 .",
    "the techniques include grbner bases , resultants , eigenvalues of companion matrices @xcite , and numerical homotopy methods @xcite , @xcite .",
    "an entirely different approach was introduced by n.z .",
    "shor ( @xcite , @xcite ) and further developed in the dissertation of the first author @xcite .",
    "the idea is to compute the largest real number @xmath6 such that @xmath7 is a sum of squares in @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "clearly , @xmath6 is a lower bound for the optimal value @xmath2 .",
    "we show in section 3 that , when the degree of @xmath5 is fixed , the lower bound @xmath6 can be computed in polynomial time using semidefinite programming @xcite .",
    "if @xmath9 holds then this is certified by semidefinite programming duality , and the certificate yields the optimal point @xmath3 . in our computational experiments , to be presented in section 5 , we found that @xmath9 almost always holds , and we solved problems up to @xmath10 .",
    "the objective of this article is to provide a bridge between mathematical programming and algebraic geometry , demonstrating that algorithms from the former have the potential to play a major role in future algorithms in the latter .",
    "this will be underlined in section 6 , where we present open problems , and in section 7 where we show that semidefinite programming in conjunction with the positivstellensatz is applicable to a wide range of computational problems in real algebraic geometry .",
    "in this section we discuss the following approach to our problem ( [ defprob ] ) . form the partial derivatives of the given polynomial @xmath11 and consider the ideal they generate : @xmath12 \\ , = : \\ , { { \\ensuremath{\\mathbb{r}}}}[{\\bf x}]\\ ] ] the zeros of the ideal @xmath13 in complex @xmath14-space @xmath15 are the _ critical points _ of @xmath5 . their number ( counting multiplicity )",
    "is the dimension over @xmath16 of the residue ring : @xmath17/i   \\quad = \\quad \\ # \\ , \\mathcal { v}_{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{c}}}}(i).\\ ] ] we shall assume that @xmath18 is finite .",
    "( if @xmath19 then one can apply perturbation techniques to reduce to the case @xmath20 ) .",
    "for instance , if @xmath5 is a dense polynomial of even degree @xmath21 then it follows from _ bzout s theorem _ that @xmath22 .",
    "consider the subset of _ real critical points _ : @xmath23 this set is usually much smaller than the set of all complex critical points , i.e. , typically we have @xmath24 .",
    "if we know the set @xmath25 , then our problem is solved .",
    "[ critical ] the optimal value is attained at a critical point : @xmath26    the three techniques to be described in this section all compute the set @xmath27 of real critical points .",
    "we will illustrate then for the following example : @xmath28 the optimal value for this problem is @xmath29 , and , disregarding symmetry , there are three optimal points @xmath30",
    "attaining this value : @xmath31      we review the method of solving polynomial equations by means of grbner bases and eigenvalues @xcite . we are free to choose an arbitrary term order @xmath32 on the polynomial ring @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "let @xmath34 be a grbner basis for the critical ideal @xmath13 with respect to @xmath32 .",
    "while computing grbner bases is a time - consuming task in general , this is not an issue in this paper , since in all our examples the @xmath14 given generators @xmath35 already form a grbner basis in the total degree order . in our example",
    "the grbner basis is @xmath36 a monomial @xmath37 is _ standard _ if it is not divisible by the leading term of any element in the grbner basis @xmath34 .",
    "the set @xmath38 of standard monomials is an @xmath16-basis for the residue ring @xmath39/i$ ] .",
    "the standard monomials for ( [ grobnerbasis ] ) are : @xmath40 for any polynomial @xmath41 $ ] consider the @xmath16-linear endomorphism : @xmath42/i \\ , \\rightarrow \\ ,   { { \\ensuremath{\\mathbb{r}}}}[{\\bf x}]/i \\ , , \\,\\ , h \\,\\mapsto \\ , g \\cdot h.\\ ] ] this endomorphism is represented in the basis @xmath38 by a real @xmath43-matrix @xmath44 .",
    "the entry of @xmath44 with row index @xmath45 and column index @xmath46 is the coefficient of @xmath47 in the normal form of @xmath48 with respect to @xmath34 .",
    "the optimal value @xmath2 is the smallest real eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath49 .",
    "any eigenvector of @xmath49 with eigenvalue @xmath2 defines an optimal point @xmath50 by the eigenvector identities @xmath51 for @xmath52 .",
    "this follows from lemma [ critical ] and theorem ( 4.5 ) in the book of cox - little - oshea @xcite ; see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* exercise 17 , page 62 ) .",
    "the resulting algorithm is to compute symbolically the matrices @xmath53 and @xmath54 for @xmath52 , then compute numerically its eigenvalues ( and matching eigenvectors ) of @xmath49 , and finally determine @xmath2 and @xmath3 as in the proposition .    in our example",
    "the matrix @xmath49 has format @xmath55 with rows and columns indexed by ( [ exampleb ] ) . of its @xmath56 entries only @xmath57",
    "are nonzero .",
    "for instance , the column indexed by @xmath58 has four nonzero entries , namely , the coefficients of @xmath59 the matrix @xmath49 has maximal rank @xmath60 . of its eigenvalues",
    "only three are real : @xmath61 the three real eigenvalues have multiplicity @xmath62,@xmath63 , and @xmath62 respectively .",
    "one algebraic method for solving polynomial equations is to use resultants .",
    "closely related to resultants are discriminants .",
    "they express the condition on a hypersurface to have a singularity , by means of a polynomial in the coefficients its defining equation .",

    "* chapter 9 ) , where @xmath69 is the support of @xmath5 together with the origin . from (",
    "* ? ? ? * h ) we conclude that the discriminant @xmath70 equals the characteristic polynomial of the matrix @xmath49 .",

    "this sextic has galois group @xmath74 , so @xmath2 can not be expressed in radicals over the rationals .",
    "the suggested algorithm is to compute @xmath70 , and minimal polynomials for the coordinates @xmath75 of the optimal point , by elimination of variables using matrix formulas for resultants and discriminants ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 13 ) .",
    "the subsequent numerical computation is to find the roots of a univariate polynomial .",
    "the critical equations form a square system : @xmath14 equations in @xmath14 variables having finitely many roots .",
    "such a system is well - suited for _ numerical homotopy continuation methods_. for an introduction to this subject see the papers of li @xcite and verschelde @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to introduce a deformation parameter @xmath76 into the given system .",
    "for instance , we might replace ( [ grobnerbasis ] ) by the following system which depends on a complex parameter @xmath76 : @xmath77 the solutions @xmath78 are algebraic functions of @xmath76 .",
    "our goal is to find them for @xmath79 .",
    "it is easy to find the solutions for @xmath80 : @xmath81 homotopy methods trace the full set of solutions from @xmath80 to @xmath79 along a suitable path in the complex @xmath76-plane .",
    "we determine @xmath2 by evaluating the objective function @xmath82 at all the real solutions for @xmath79 .",
    "homotopy methods are frequently set up so that the system at @xmath83 breaks up into several systems , each of which consists of binomials . if the input polynomials are sparse , then these are the _ polyhedral homotopies _ which take the newton polytopes of the given equations into consideration . in the sparse case ,",
    "the number @xmath18 will be the _",
    "mixed volume _ of the newton polytopes .",
    "for an introduction to these polyhedral methods see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 7 ) and the references given there .",
    "a common feature of all three algebraic algorithms in this section is that their running time is controlled by the number @xmath18 of complex critical points . in the eigenvalue method",
    "we must perform linear algebra on matrices of size @xmath43 , in the discriminant method we must find and solve a univariate polynomial of degree @xmath18 , and in the homotopy method , we are forced to trace @xmath18 paths from @xmath80 to @xmath79 .",
    "each of these three methods becomes infeasible if the number @xmath18 is too big ; for instance , @xmath84 might be too big .",
    "suppose that the given polynomial @xmath5 in @xmath8 $ ] has even degree @xmath21 and is dense .",
    "this will be the case in the family of examples studied in section 5 .",
    "then @xmath18 coincides with the bzout number @xmath85 .",
    "some small values for the bzout number are listed in table [ tab : matsiz ] .",
    "most entries in this table are bigger than @xmath86 . we are led to believe that the algebraic methods will be infeasible for quartics if @xmath87 .    each entry in the first row of table [ tab : matsiz ] is a one .",
    "this means we can minimize quadratic polynomial functions by solving a system of linear equations ( in polynomial time ) .",
    "the punchline of this paper is to reduce our problem to a semidefinite programming problem which can also be solved in polynomial time for fixed @xmath88 .",

    "we have demonstrated that the sums of squares relaxation is a powerful and practical technique in polynomial optimization .",
    "there are many open questions , both algorithmic and mathematical , which are raised by our experimental results .",
    "one obvious question is how often does it occur that @xmath90  ?",
    "this can be studied for our simple model ( [ eq : polyfam ] ) , or , perhaps better , for various natural probability measures on the space of polynomials of bounded degree . this question is closely related to understanding the inclusion of the convex cone of forms that are sums of squares inside the cone of positive semidefinite forms . for the three - dimensional family of symmetric sextics ,",
    "this problem was studied in detail by choi , lam and reznick @xcite .",
    "their work is an inspiration , but it also provides a warning as to how difficult the general case will be , even for ternary sextics without symmetry .",
    "we hope to pursue some of the following directions of inquiry in the near future .",
    "most polynomial systems one encounters are sparse in the sense that there are only few monomials with nonzero coefficients .",
    "methods involving newton polytopes , such as sparse resultants @xcite and polyhedral homotopies @xcite , are designed to deal with such problems .",
    "symmetry with respect to finite matrix groups is another feature of many polynomial problems arising in practise .",
    "the book of gatermann @xcite is an excellent first reference .",
    "we wish to adapt our semidefinite programming approach to input polynomials @xmath5 which are sparse or symmetric or both .",
    "for instance , our polynomial example ( [ runningex ] ) is both sparse and invariant under permutation of the variables @xmath91 .",
    "both newton polytope techniques and representation theory can be used to reduce the size of the matrices and the number of free parameters in the semi - definite programs .",
    "if we are unlucky , then the output produced by sedumi will not satisfy the hypothesis of proposition [ completesquare ] , and we conclude that the bound @xmath92 is probably strictly smaller than the optimal solution @xmath2 . in that event",
    "we redo our computation in higher degree , now with a larger sdp .",
    "the key idea is that even though @xmath93 may not be a sum of squares , if there exists a positive polynomial @xmath94 such that @xmath95 is a sum of squares , then @xmath96",
    ". the choice of @xmath97 can be either made _ a priori _",
    "( for instance , @xmath98 ) , or as a result of an optimization step ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the positivstellensatz ( see section 7 ) ensures that @xmath2 will be found if the degree of @xmath97 is large enough .",
    "a natural application of shor s relaxation , hinted at in @xcite , is solving polynomial systems @xmath99 .",
    "the polynomial @xmath100 satisfies @xmath101 , and @xmath102 holds if and only if the system has a real root . clearly , @xmath103 is a sufficient condition for the nonexistence of real roots",
    ". an important open problem , essentially raised in @xcite , is to characterize inconsistent systems @xmath104 with @xmath105 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath106 holds then it is possible , at least in principle , to obtain a numerical approximation of real roots using sdp .",
    "however , for a robust implementation , perturbation arguments are required and some important numerical issues arise , so the perspectives for practical applications are still unclear .      consider a compact set @xmath107 where @xmath108 is a linear form plus a constant , say , @xmath109 is a polytope with @xmath110 facets .",
    "theorem @xcite states that every polynomial which is strictly positive on @xmath109 can be expressed as a positive linear combination of products @xmath111 .",
    "suppose we wish to minimize a given polynomial function @xmath112 over @xmath109 .",
    "for @xmath113 we define the _ @xmath114-th handelman bound _",
    "@xmath115 to be the largest @xmath116 such that @xmath117 handelman s theorem states that the increasing sequence @xmath118 converges to the minimum of @xmath5 over @xmath109 .",
    "each bound @xmath119 can be computed using * linear programming only*. it would be interesting to study the quality of these bounds , and the running time of these linear programs , and to see how things improve as we augment the approach with semidefinite programming techniques .",
    "the feasible set of an sdp can be expressed by a linear matrix inequality , as in the dual formulation in section 4.2 .",
    "it would be interesting to study these feasible sets using techniques from real algebraic geometry , and to identify characteristic features of these sets .",
    "here is a very concrete problem whose solution , to the best of our knowledge , is not known .",
    "fix three real symmetric matrices @xmath120 and @xmath121 of size @xmath122 .",
    "then @xmath123 is a closed , convex , semialgebraic subset of the plane @xmath124 .",
    "the problem is to find a good characterization of those subsets @xmath125 .",
    "given a semialgebraic subset @xmath126 which is closed and convex , how to decide whether a `` semidefinite representation '' exists , and , in the affirmative case , how to find matrices @xmath127 of minimum size .",
    "the first part of the above title refers to a paper by sommese and wampler @xcite .",
    "this paper and other more recent ones suggest that numerical algorithms will play an increasingly important role in computational ( complex ) algebraic geometry , and that polynomial systems will become much more visible in the context of _ scientific computation_. along the same lines , the fastest software for computing grbner bases , due to faugre @xcite , no longer uses the buchberger algorithm but replaces it by sophisticated numerical linear algebra .",
    "faugre s scheme @xmath128 has the potential of entering the standard repertoire of scientific computation .",
    "following @xcite we propose an analogous scheme for the field of real numbers : @xmath129 in what follows , we shall explain this relationship and why we see the positivstellensatz as the main catalyst for a future role of real algebra in scientific computation .",
    "the positivstellensatz @xcite is a common generalization of linear programming duality ( for linear inequalities ) and hilbert s nullstellensatz ( for an algebraically closed field ) .",
    "it states that , for a system of polynomial equations and inequalities , either there exists a solution in @xmath1 , or there exists a certain polynomial identity which bears _ witness _ to the fact that no solution exists .",
    "for instance , a single polynomial inequality @xmath130 either has a solution @xmath131 , or there exists an identity @xmath132 where @xmath97 and @xmath133 are sums of squares .",
    "see @xcite for an exposition of the positivstellensatz from the perspective of computational geometry .",
    "finding a witness by linear programming is proposed in @xcite .    here is our punchline , first stated in the dissertation of the first author @xcite : _ a positivstellensatz witness of bounded degree can be computed by semidefinite programming .",
    "here we can also optimize linear parameters in the coefficients .",
    "_ this suggests the following algorithm for deciding a system of polynomial equations and inequalities : decide whether there exists a witness for infeasibility of degree @xmath134 , for some @xmath135 .",
    "if our system is feasible , then we might like to minimize a polynomial @xmath112 over the solution set .",
    "the _ @xmath114-th sdp relaxation _ would be to ask for the largest real number @xmath6 such that the given system together with the inequality @xmath136 has an infeasibility witness of degree @xmath114 .",
    "this generalizes what was proposed in sections 6.2 , 6.3 and 6.4 .",
    "it is possible , at least in principle , to use an a priori bound for the degree @xmath114 in the positivestellensatz , however , the currently known bounds are still very large .",
    "lombardi and roy recently announced a bound which is triply - exponential in the number @xmath14 of variables .",
    "we hope that such bounds can be further improved , at least for some natural families of polynomial problems arising in optimization .",
    "here is a very simple example in the plane to illustrate our method : @xmath137 by the positivstellensatz , the system @xmath138 has no solution @xmath139 if and only if there exist polynomials @xmath140 $ ] that satisfy the following : @xmath141 the @xmath114-th sdp relaxation of the polynomial problem @xmath138 asks whether there exists a solution @xmath142 to ( [ eq : pstz ] ) where the polynomial @xmath143 has degree @xmath134 and the polynomials @xmath144 have degree @xmath145 . for each fixed integer @xmath146",
    "this can be tested by semidefinite programming .",
