    "since their introduction in 1987 by haussler and welzl  @xcite ( see also clarkson  @xcite and clarkson and shor  @xcite for related concepts ) , @xmath4-nets have become one of the central concepts in computational and combinatorial geometry , and have been used in a variety of applications , such as range searching , geometric partitions , and bounds on curve - point incidences , to name a few .",
    "we recall their definition : a _ range space _",
    "@xmath6 is a pair consisting of an underlying universe @xmath7 of objects , and a certain collection @xmath8 of subsets ( _ ranges _ ) of @xmath7 .",
    "of particular interest are range spaces of _ finite vc - dimension _ ; skipping the exact definition , it suffices to require that , for any finite subset @xmath9 , the number of distinct sets @xmath10 , for @xmath11 , is @xmath12 , for some constant @xmath13 ( which is upper bounded by the vc - dimension of @xmath6 ) .    given a range space @xmath6 , a finite subset @xmath9 , and a parameter @xmath14 , an _",
    "@xmath4-net _ for @xmath0 ( and @xmath8 ) is a subset @xmath15 with the property that any range @xmath11 with @xmath16 contains an element of @xmath17 . in other words",
    ", @xmath17 is a hitting set for all the `` heavy '' ranges .",
    "the important result of haussler and welzl asserts that , for any @xmath6 , @xmath0 , and @xmath4 as above , such that @xmath6 has finite vc - dimension @xmath13 , there exists an @xmath4-net @xmath17 of size @xmath18 , and that a random sample of @xmath0 of that size is an @xmath4-net with constant probability .",
    "in particular , the size of @xmath17 is independent of the size of @xmath0 .    in geometric applications ,",
    "this abstract framework is used as follows .",
    "the ground set @xmath7 is typically a set of simple geometric objects ( points , lines , hyperplanes ) , and the ranges in @xmath8 are defined as a boolean combination of intersection with ( or , for point objects , containment in ) simply - shaped regions ( halfspaces , balls , simplices , etc . ) , formally required to be regions of _ constant descriptive complexity _ , meaning that they are semi - algebraic sets defined in terms of a constant number of polynomial equations and inequalities of constant maximum degree .",
    "it is known that in such cases the resulting range space @xmath6 has finite vc - dimension ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one of the major questions in the theory of @xmath4-nets , posed since their introduction more than 25 years ago , is whether the factor @xmath19 in the upper bound on their size is really necessary , especially in `` normal '' ( geometric ) situations . to be precise ,",
    "it has been known , pretty early in the game , that in the general abstract context the answer is `` yes '' .",
    "this was shown by komls , pach and woeginger  @xcite back in 1992 , using a randomized construction on abstract hypergraphs ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "concerning simple geometric range spaces , alon  @xcite was the first to obtain a `` non - linear '' lower bound ( i.e. , more than @xmath20 for any positive constant @xmath21 ) on the size of @xmath4-nets for the range space of points and triangles in the plane .",
    "more recently , pach and tardos @xcite showed a lower bound of @xmath22 for points and axis - parallel rectangles in the plane , and , more significantly , a lower bound @xmath23 for the dual range space ( namely , a range space where @xmath7 is a collection of axis - parallel rectangles , and each range is the subset of the rectangles that contains some given point ) .",
    "a simple reduction then leads to a lower bound of @xmath23 on the size of @xmath4-nets for points and halfspaces in @xmath24 .",
    "in other words , @xmath4-nets of size smaller than @xmath25 , even in simple geometric contexts , seem to be a relatively rare phenomenon .    nevertheless , many improved upper bounds on the size of @xmath4-nets in a variety of geometric contexts have been obtained  @xcite .",
    "some of these bounds are linear ( in @xmath26 ) , while others are in between linear and the general bound @xmath27 .",
    "the first linear bound on the size of @xmath4-nets has been obtained by matouek , seidel and welzl  @xcite , 25 years ago , for the special cases of points and halfspaces in two and three dimensions , and for some other related special cases .",
    "the proofs in @xcite are somewhat involved , and appear to have some technical difficulties , which are corrected in a revised version .",
    "matouekhas given an alternative construction for halfspaces ( in two and three dimensions ) , with the same bounds , using his shallow - cutting lemma @xcite .",
    "additional progress was made more recently .",
    "clarkson and varadarajan  @xcite , essentially adapting matouek s technique to their more general setting , have come up with a technique for constructing small - size @xmath4-nets in geometric dual range spaces , where , as above , the objects of @xmath7 are simply shaped regions , and each range is the subset of regions that are stabbed by some point . if the combinatorial complexity of the union of any finite number @xmath28 of the regions is small , specifically @xmath29 , then the corresponding range space admits @xmath4-nets of size @xmath30 .",
    "pyrga and ray  @xcite have proposed a general abstract scheme for constructing small - size @xmath4-nets in hypergraphs ( that is , range spaces ) which satisfy certain properties , and have applied it to the special cases of halfspaces in two and three dimensions , and to a few other related instances .",
    "later , aronov , ezra and sharir  @xcite have shown the existence of @xmath4-nets of size @xmath31 for the range space of points and axis - parallel rectangles in the plane ( a tight bound as subsequently shown by pach and tardos ) , as well as improved bounds for the size of @xmath4-nets for several other range spaces .",
    "see also king and kirkpatrick  @xcite for another recent improved bound for @xmath4-nets for range spaces related to art - gallery visibility .",
    "[ [ our - results . ] ] our results .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + +    in this note we re - examine the techniques in @xcite , extract from them the main ingredients , and dress them up in different and arguably simpler proofs , which exploit the geometry of arrangements of planes in 3-space and of several other geometric structures .",
    "one of our ( more complicated ) proofs is essentially a restatement of matouek s proof in @xcite , and of the similar ( more general ) proof in clarkson and varadarajan  @xcite ; we give it here for the sake of completeness .",
    "the other four proofs are ( in our opinion ) considerably simpler .",
    "they use as a key ingredient a construction of pyrga and ray  @xcite , but the analyses of the size of the resulting structure are different .",
    "it is our hope that the multitude of proofs will shed more light on the problem , and that some of them might eventually be extended to other geometric range spaces .",
    "finally , we note that , for the case of halfspaces in three ( and two ) dimensions , one can construct linear - size @xmath4-nets in an efficient deterministic manner , by a careful implementation of the construction given in the proofs , using standard techniques due to matouek  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 be a set of @xmath1 points in @xmath2 in general position , and let @xmath32 be the family of all ( closed ) halfspaces ( bounded by planes ) .",
    "the main result of this section is :      * remark . *",
    "clearly , the theorem implies that a similar result holds for the range space of points and halfplanes in the plane .",
    "this , however , can be established using considerably simpler and shorter proofs , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the general position assumption in the theorem is for the sake of simplicity of exposition , and was used also in the previous work @xcite .",
    "we give five different proofs of the theorem .",
    "the first four use the same construction , inspired by the approach of pyrga and ray  @xcite , but differ in the way they show that the resulting @xmath4-net has small size .",
    "the fifth proof is essentially a restatement of the proof of matouek@xcite , and of the similar more general proof in @xcite , and is included here for the sake of completeness ; it is ( in our opinion ) somewhat more complex than the first four proofs .      without loss of generality",
    ", it suffices to construct an @xmath4-net for _ lower _ halfspaces .",
    "a symmetric construction will yield an @xmath4-net for _ upper _ halfspaces , and the union of the two nets will be an @xmath4-net for all halfspaces .",
    "let @xmath35 denote the set of all lower halfspaces .",
    "we fix some constant fraction @xmath36 ( different choices of @xmath37 will be made in the different proofs ) , and construct a maximal collection @xmath38 of lower halfspaces with the following properties ( where we assume that @xmath39 , for otherwise there exists a constant - size @xmath4-net , by the general theory in @xcite ) :          for each halfspace @xmath44 , we construct a @xmath45-net @xmath46 for the set system @xmath47 , of size @xmath48 , using the standard bounds on the size of @xmath4-nets  @xcite , and form the union @xmath49 .",
    "we next repeat the same construction for each value @xmath50 , for @xmath51 , using the same parameter @xmath37 for each @xmath52 .",
    "we obtain a sequence of subsets @xmath53 , and we set @xmath17 to be their union .",
    "let us also denote by @xmath54 the maximal set of halfspaces constructed at the @xmath55thstep .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath17 is an @xmath4-net for @xmath56 .",
    "indeed , let @xmath57 be a lower halfspace which contains at least @xmath40 points of @xmath0 .",
    "there exists @xmath58 such that latexmath:[$2^{j-1}{{\\varepsilon}}n\\le    certainly contains a point of @xmath17 ( it contains the nonempty subset @xmath60 ) .",
    "otherwise , @xmath61 must violate property ( b ) , so @xmath54 contains a lower halfspace @xmath62 such that @xmath63 hence , by construction , @xmath57 must contain a point of @xmath64 , and thus of @xmath17 .",
    "* the approach just presented , which uses a geometric progression of values of @xmath4 and a corresponding sequence of constructions , appears to be unnecessarily over - complicated .",
    "specifically , for halfspaces , a single step suffices : we only construct @xmath69 , and claim that it is an @xmath4-net .",
    "indeed , if @xmath57 is any lower halfspace containing at least @xmath40 points of @xmath0 then , by the general position assumption , we can shrink it to another halfspace @xmath70 which contains exactly @xmath40 points of @xmath0 .",
    "the preceding argument implies that @xmath71 contains a point of @xmath69 , and therefore so does @xmath57 .",
    "the reason for complicating the construction is that it can also handle ranges which do not have this `` shrinking property '' , namely the property that any range can be shrunk to a smaller range which contains any prescribed number of points of @xmath0 .",
    "the same trick of repeatedly doubling @xmath4 has also been used by pyrga and ray  @xcite .        for each @xmath44",
    "let @xmath73 denote its bounding plane . by slightly perturbing these planes , without changing any of the subsets @xmath74 , for @xmath44 , we may assume that the planes @xmath73 are in general position .",
    "we claim that all the planes @xmath73 appear on their upper envelope @xmath75 . indeed , suppose to the contrary that there exists @xmath44 such that @xmath73 lies fully below the envelope .",
    "let @xmath76 be the vertex of the envelope closest to @xmath57 .",
    "clearly , the union of the three halfspaces @xmath77 defining @xmath76 cover @xmath57 ; that is , @xmath78 . hence , for at least one index @xmath79 ,",
    "we have @xmath80 , which contradicts property ( b ) if we choose @xmath81 .          put @xmath82 , and consider @xmath75 as a planar map , which has @xmath83 faces .",
    "define the _ degree _ @xmath84 of a face @xmath85 of @xmath75 , lying on some plane @xmath73 , to be the number of planes @xmath86 which appear on the @xmath87-level of @xmath88 directly below @xmath85 ( see figure  [ fig : poc ] for an illustration ) .",
    "in general , each such plane @xmath86 either meets @xmath89 or contributes a face to the @xmath87-level which lies fully below @xmath85 ; the second case is impossible , though , for then @xmath86 would not appear on the upper envelope .",
    "hence , assuming general position , @xmath84 is equal to the number of edges of @xmath85 .    by euler s formula ,",
    "the number of edges of the upper envelope of @xmath83 planes in @xmath2 is at most @xmath90 .",
    "since each such edge participates in two pockets , we get @xmath91 , where the sum extends over all faces @xmath85 of @xmath75 .",
    "hence , at least half of the @xmath83 faces of @xmath75 have degree at most @xmath92 ; refer to these faces as _",
    "light_.    let @xmath85 be one of these faces , and let @xmath57 be the corresponding halfspace .",
    "then we have @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the set of all halfspaces which contribute to the degree of @xmath85 ; refer to this expression as the _ pocket _ of @xmath85 ( or of @xmath57 ) . by the choice of @xmath85",
    ", we have @xmath95 .",
    "hence , the number of points of @xmath0 in the pocket is at least @xmath96 if we choose @xmath97 .",
    "since the pockets are clearly pairwise disjoint , the overall number of points of @xmath0 in the pockets of the at least @xmath98 light faces is at least @xmath99 .",
    "hence we have @xmath100 , implying that @xmath101 , as claimed .",
    "@xmath102      here , in an attempt to generalize the analysis to other kinds of range spaces , we do not assume that all the bounding planes appear on the upper envelope .",
    "let @xmath103 denote the subset of those halfspaces in @xmath38 whose bounding planes do appear on the envelope of @xmath38 , and put @xmath104 .",
    "for @xmath105 , let @xmath106 be the subset of halfspaces in @xmath107 whose bounding planes appear on the upper envelope of @xmath108 .",
    "we repeat this peeling process , so at the last stage @xmath109 , all of @xmath38 is exhausted , and @xmath110 .",
    "the overall complexity of the @xmath111- and @xmath87-levels of @xmath112 is at most @xmath113 , where @xmath114 , and where @xmath115 is some absolute constant .",
    "this follows from euler s formula for the @xmath111-level ( as in the first proof ) , combined with the random sampling technique of clarkson and shor  @xcite ( or , alternatively , the simpler scheme of tagansky  @xcite ) . for this , note that any plane that shows up on the @xmath111- or @xmath87-level in @xmath112 must belong to @xmath116 .",
    "that is , every time we peel away the halfspaces touching the envelope , we also remove the pockets touching the envelope , `` exposing '' their lower boundaries to the upper unbounded cell , and making these boundaries participate in the next envelope .",
    "recall that here we no longer assume that all the planes bounding a pocket reach the boundary of its upper facet , as in the preceding proof .",
    "after the removal of @xmath106 , the new pockets of the bounding planes of halfspaces in @xmath117 are ( pairwise disjoint and ) disjoint from the pockets of the preceding stages .    summing over all stages , we obtain a total of @xmath118 pockets ( each plane contributes exactly one pocket ) , and the sum of the degrees of the corresponding halfspaces ( which we bound by the complexity of their pockets ) is at most @xmath119 .",
    "hence , the average degree of a halfspace is at most @xmath120 , and therefore at least half of the pockets are of halfspaces with degree at most @xmath121 .",
    "hence , choosing @xmath122 , and arguing as above , the bound @xmath123 follows .",
    "@xmath102      the preceding proof peels off the halfspaces of @xmath38 in batches , where in each step we remove many halfspaces .",
    "an alternative , and perhaps somewhat more natural approach is to peel them off one by one . in this proof",
    "we use a random peeling order , and exploit known properties of randomized incremental constructions of upper envelopes to establish the desired bound on the size of @xmath38 .",
    "specifically , draw a random permutation of @xmath38 , which we write as @xmath124 , and insert the halfspaces one by one in this order .",
    "when @xmath125 is inserted , it adds to the union a new ( possibly empty ) pocket , which , as above , is @xmath126 ; the pocket is nonempty if and only if @xmath127 appears on the current upper envelope @xmath128 .",
    "an obvious but crucial property is that all these pockets are pairwise openly disjoint . to facilitate the analysis",
    ", we maintain a triangulation of @xmath128 , using , e.g. , bottom - vertex triangulation of each facet , and maintain for each triangle @xmath129 a _ conflict list _ of all the halfspaces @xmath57 not yet inserted , which meet @xmath129 .",
    "if @xmath129 lies fully in the interior of such a halfspace @xmath57 , then adding @xmath57 removes @xmath129 completely from the envelope ; otherwise , adding @xmath57 splits @xmath129 into a portion which is hidden from the envelope and a portion which remains on the envelope .",
    "the remaining portions of the envelope are re - triangulated , the conflict lists of the new triangles are computed from the lists of the destroyed triangles , and the process continues .",
    "see , e.g. , seidel  @xcite for a review of randomized incremental constructions of this kind .    the standard analysis of randomized incremental constructions ( see @xcite )",
    "implies that the expected overall number of triangles that are ever created by the algorithm is at most @xmath130 , for some absolute constant @xmath131 .",
    "note that the complexity of the pocket of @xmath125 , and thus the degree of @xmath125 , _ at the time of its insertion _ , is proportional to the number of triangles of @xmath132 that are killed by @xmath125 , either by being fully eliminated , or by being split and replaced by new triangles ; refer to these degrees as the _ degrees at birth_. it follows that the expected sum of the degrees at birth of the halfspaces is at most @xmath133 , for another absolute constant @xmath134 .",
    "hence the average degree at birth is at most @xmath135 , so at least half of the halfspaces have degree at birth at most @xmath136",
    ".    choose @xmath137 .",
    "arguing as above , it is easy to see that the number of points of @xmath0 in the pocket at birth of such a ` light ' halfspace is at least @xmath138 . hence the total number of points of @xmath0 in these pockets is at least @xmath139",
    ". since the pockets at birth are pairwise disjoint , the bound on @xmath83 follows .",
    "@xmath102      this time we pass to the dual space , where each point @xmath140 is mapped to a dual plane @xmath141 , and each range @xmath142 is mapped to a dual point @xmath143 ( actually , dual to the plane bounding @xmath57 ) , so that point @xmath144 lies in halfspace @xmath57 if and only if the dual point @xmath143 lies above the dual plane @xmath141 .",
    "let @xmath145 ( resp . ,",
    "@xmath146 ) denote the resulting set of @xmath1 dual planes ( resp .",
    ", of @xmath83 dual points ) .",
    "note that the level of each point @xmath147 in the arrangement @xmath148 is between @xmath149 and @xmath150 , and that , for any pair of distinct points @xmath151 , the number of planes that separate them is at least @xmath152 .",
    "indeed , each of these planes passes below exactly one of @xmath143 , @xmath153 .",
    "since at least @xmath109 planes pass below @xmath143 , at least @xmath109 planes pass below @xmath153 , and at most @xmath154 planes pass below both of them , the claim follows .",
    "choose @xmath155 , and define , for each dual point @xmath147 , the `` ball '' @xmath156 of all the vertices of @xmath148 which are separated from @xmath143 by fewer than @xmath28 planes .",
    "as argued by welzl  @xcite , the number of vertices in @xmath156 is @xmath157 . by construction",
    ", no vertex of @xmath148 can appear in more than one of these balls .",
    "indeed , let @xmath158 denote the number of planes of @xmath145 which separate @xmath159 and @xmath76 ; then @xmath160 satisfies the triangle inequality , from which the claim follows readily . moreover , since @xmath143 lies at level between @xmath109 and @xmath150 , the level of any of these vertices is between @xmath161 and @xmath162 , so they all lie at level at most @xmath163 . as shown by clarkson and shor  @xcite ,",
    "the overall number of vertices of @xmath148 at level at most @xmath163 is @xmath164 .",
    "hence the number @xmath83 of balls satisfies @xmath165 , and thus @xmath166 .",
    "@xmath102      this proof is an adaptation of matouek s proof on shallow cutting ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5 ) , and also of the proof in @xcite , which itself is an extension of matouek s proof ; we include it here for the sake of completeness . in this proof",
    "we abandon the set @xmath38 . as in the preceding proof ,",
    "we dualize the points of @xmath0 to planes , and denote the resulting set of planes by @xmath145 .",
    "choose a random sample @xmath167 of @xmath168 points of @xmath0 , pass to the subset @xmath169 of dual planes , construct their lower envelope @xmath170 , and triangulate each of its faces , into a total of @xmath171 triangles .",
    "we extend each of these triangles @xmath172 downwards to the semi - unbounded vertical prism @xmath129 bounded from above by @xmath172 .",
    "we thus obtain a decomposition of the region @xmath173 below @xmath170 into @xmath171 such prisms .",
    "we take @xmath167 to be part of the output @xmath4-net . by construction ,",
    "any lower halfspace @xmath57 whose bounding plane is dualized into a point @xmath143 which lies above @xmath170 has a plane of @xmath174 passing below it , so , in primal space , @xmath57 contains the point of @xmath167 dual to that plane .",
    "thus it remains to consider halfspaces whose dual points lie below @xmath170 .    by the @xmath4-net theory ,",
    "our sample @xmath167 satisfies , with high probability , the property that each of the prisms @xmath129 in the decomposition of @xmath173 is crossed by at most @xmath175 planes of @xmath145 , for some absolute constant @xmath115 .",
    "we may assume that our sample does indeed satisfy this property .",
    "let @xmath129 be one of the prisms , and suppose that @xmath129 is crossed by @xmath176 planes of @xmath145 . if @xmath177 , we leave @xmath129 intact",

    "we may assume that each of these samples is a @xmath180-net , for the corresponding value of @xmath83 , for the range space of the planes of @xmath145 crossing @xmath129 , where each range is the subset of planes stabbed by some downward - directed vertical ray ( that is , lying below some point ) .",
    "we take @xmath17 to be the union of @xmath167 and of all the primal sets @xmath181 ( dual to the corresponding @xmath178 ) , and claim that @xmath17 is an @xmath4-net .",
    "that is , if @xmath57 is a lower halfspace that contains at least @xmath40 points of @xmath0 then @xmath57 contains a point of @xmath17 .",
    "indeed , as already noted , it suffices to consider the case where the point @xmath143 dual to the plane bounding @xmath57 lies in @xmath173 . by the same reasoning ,",
    "if @xmath143 lies in some initial prism @xmath129 and above the upper envelope @xmath182 of @xmath178 , we are also done .",
    "the remaining case is impossible , because then the downward - directed vertical ray emanating from @xmath143 does not meet any plane of @xmath178 , and therefore meets fewer than @xmath40 planes of @xmath145 , contradicting the assumption that @xmath57 is `` heavy '' .",
    "it remains to show that @xmath183 .",
    "this follows from the exponential decay lemma , initially established by chazelle and friedman  @xcite , and later extended by agarwal _",

    "* remarks . *",
    "( 1 ) it is interesting to compare the construction used in the first four proofs to the one used in the fifth .",
    "a common feature of both constructions is that their last step involves the construction of @xmath184-nets , for @xmath184 a _ constant _ , for many subsets of @xmath0 .",
    "however , these subsets are obtained by what seems to be totally unrelated methods .",
    "it would be interesting to `` see through '' these constructions , and perhaps show that they are more related than what meets the eye .",
    "\\(2 ) it is worth mentioning that the construction of pyrga and ray , on which our proofs are based , might be very inefficient in some simple geometric settings ( other than the one considered here ) .",
    "for example , consider the range space defined by points and lines in the plane .",
    "we use the construction of elekes @xcite of @xmath1 points and @xmath1 lines in the plane with @xmath185 incidences .",
    "let @xmath109 be an integer and put @xmath186 .",

    "moreover , every pair of such lines intersect in at most one point of @xmath0 . hence , the collection @xmath38 of these lines satisfies conditions ( a ) and ( b ) of the construction , but @xmath193 is way too large , namely @xmath194 .      in this final subsection , we note that , for the case of halfspaces in three ( and two ) dimensions , one can construct linear - size @xmath4-nets in an efficient deterministic manner , by a careful implementation of the construction given in the first four proofs of theorem  [ main3d ] , using standard techniques due to matouekand others .",
    "specifically , we will only consider the problem in three dimensions , since the two - dimensional case can be handled as a special case .",
    "moreover , a different deterministic construction in the plane follows from the technique of matouekin @xcite .",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "consider the dual version , in which we have a collection @xmath195 of @xmath1 planes in @xmath2 , and the ranges correspond to points , so that the range of a point @xmath196 is the set of planes passing below @xmath196 . consider a modified range space , in which the ranges are defined by segments , so that the range of segment @xmath197 is the set of planes of @xmath195 which cross @xmath197 .",

    "@xmath7 ) that cross @xmath197 , then we have @xmath202 one can construct @xmath7 deterministically in time @xmath203 , where @xmath115 is some ( small ) constant , using the general technique of matouek  @xcite .",
    "next , we construct the arrangement @xmath204 , and extract from it the set @xmath205 of all the vertices at level at most @xmath206 . our goal is to compute a maximal subset @xmath207 , such that the crossing distance between any pair of vertices in @xmath38 is at least @xmath208 .",
    "we do this by explicitly computing the crossing distance ( in @xmath209 ) between each pair of points of @xmath205 , and then by augmenting @xmath38 incrementally .",
    "we first set @xmath38 to be the empty set . at each step",

    "this takes @xmath216 time per point , using the algorithm in @xcite , for an overall time @xmath217 .",
    "we take @xmath17 to be the union of all the sets @xmath213 , and claim that ( the primal image of ) @xmath17 is indeed an @xmath4-net for @xmath56 . since @xmath218",
    ", we have indeed constructed an @xmath4-net for @xmath56 of size @xmath5 .    the argument that @xmath17 is an @xmath4-net proceeds as follows .",

    "letting @xmath197 denote the downward - directed ray from @xmath196 , we have @xmath222 , and therefore @xmath223 thus @xmath196 lies at level between @xmath224 and @xmath225 in @xmath204 .",
    "let @xmath226 be a vertex of the cell in @xmath204 containing @xmath196 .",
    "then @xmath226 lies at the same level ( with respect to @xmath7 ) , and in particular @xmath227 .",
    "this implies , as above , that @xmath228 .",

    "in other words , at least half of the @xmath232 planes of @xmath195 passing below @xmath226 also pass below @xmath196 .",
    "now if @xmath233 , then the @xmath37-net @xmath234 contains a plane passing below @xmath196 ( by our choice , @xmath235 ) , and we are done .",
    "otherwise , there exists a point @xmath236 such that the crossing distance @xmath237 satisfies @xmath238 , so @xmath239 , and therefore @xmath240 hence , at least @xmath241 of the planes of @xmath195 below @xmath196 also pass below @xmath242 .",
    "observe that the level of @xmath242 in @xmath219 is at most @xmath243 , so at least @xmath244 of the planes below @xmath242 also pass below @xmath196 , so one of the planes of @xmath245 must pass below @xmath196 .",
