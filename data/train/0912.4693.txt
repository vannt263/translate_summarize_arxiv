    "measurements of momentum correlations of two low relative momentum particles produced in heavy ion collisions provide a unique information on spatio - temporal picture of the emission source at the level of few fermis .",
    "the study of the collision region on the femtometer scale via two particles correlations is called _ femtoscopy _ ( see , for example , @xcite-@xcite ) . at the early stages",
    "the studies were focused on the identical pions correlations arising from the wave function symmetrization @xcite .",
    "this type of analysis has a deep analogy with the `` hbt interferometry '' used in astronomy @xcite .",
    "since then , measurements have been performed for different systems of both identical and non - identical hadrons .",
    "high - statistics data sets were accumulated in heavy ion experiments at ags , sps and rhic accelerators @xcite-@xcite .",
    "correlations are significantly affected by the coulomb and/or strong final state interaction ( fsi ) between outgoing particles .",
    "the non - identical particle correlations due to the fsi provide information not only about space - time characteristics of the emitting source , but also about the average relative space - time separation between the emission points of the two particle species in the pair rest frame ( prf ) @xcite .",
    "maybe the most exotic system studied recently by star collaboration is @xmath3 @xcite : the particles composing the pair have one order of magnitude difference in mass plus @xmath4b=1/@xmath4s=2 gap in baryon / strangeness quantum numbers .",
    "it is challenging to study fsi of such exotic meson - baryon system and to extract information about the @xmath3 scattering lengths .",
    "the other important reason to study @xmath3 correlations is that multistrange baryons are expected to decouple earlier , than other particle species because of their small hadronic cross - sections  @xcite , allowing one to extract the space - time interval between the different stages of the fireball evolution .",
    "preliminary results for the @xmath2 system are available from star collaboration @xcite .",
    "the following important observations were made :    * decomposition of the correlation function @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the center - of - mass ( cms ) momentum ) , from @xmath7 of the most central au+au collisions into spherical harmonics , provided the first preliminary values of @xmath8 fm and @xmath9 fm .",
    "the negative value of the shift parameter @xmath10 indicates that the average emission point of @xmath11 is positioned more to the outside of the fireball than the average emission point of the pion . * in addition to coulomb interaction present in previous non - identical particle analysis the @xmath12 correlations at small relative momenta provide sufficiently clear signal of the strong fsi that reveals itself in a peak corresponding to the @xmath13 resonance .",
    "the peak s centrality dependence shows a high sensitivity to the source size . * in @xcite",
    "was shown qualitative agreement with the model calculations in the coulomb region and overestimation of the peak in the @xmath13-region .",
    "it is clear that the problem of @xmath2 correlations deserves a thorough theoretical treatment which is undertaken in the present paper .",
    "we will be concentrated on finding the expression for the @xmath2 wave function ( wf ) with coulomb and strong interactions included .",
    "the wave function enters as a building block into a correlation function ( cf ) : @xmath14 here @xmath15 is a source function , @xmath16 is the two final - state particles wf .",
    "the influence of the coulomb interaction can be taken into account following the standard procedure described in textbooks . a model independent approach to strong fsi",
    "is absent since the low energy hadron interactions can not be described from the first principles of qcd .",
    "phenomenological approach to the combined treatment of coulomb and strong fsi is based on the effective range expansion of the strong amplitude . in case of @xmath2 system",
    "the problem is rather complicated due to the following factors : @xcite-@xcite .    *",
    "the superposition of strong and coulomb interactions * the presence of @xmath13 resonance * the spin structure of the w.f . including spin - flip .",
    "* the fact that the @xmath12 state is a superposition of @xmath17 and @xmath18 isospin states and that @xmath12 state is coupled to the @xmath19 and that the thresholds of the two channels are non - degenerate . *",
    "the contribution from inner potential region where the structure of the strong interaction is unknown .",
    "the description of the @xmath2 correlation is a twofold problem .",
    "first of all one has to construct the @xmath2 wf with all factors enumerated above included .",
    "secondly , one has to use a reasonable model for the source function . in the present paper we concentrate on the first task , while the source function is taken in the simplest gaussian form .",
    "limitations of the naive gaussian model are well known and will be briefly discussed at the end of the paper . in @xcite the blast wave model for the source was used in combination with the fsi model from @xcite , the simultaneous description of the coulomb and resonance regions was not obtained .",
    "here we obtained successful description of the source size using simple gaussian source model .",
    "it is clear that more elaborated source model is need to describe simultaneously source sizes and emission asymmetries .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec2 ] is devoted to a somewhat pedagogical introduction to the description of the fsi .",
    "our purpose will be to expose the formalism in a way suited for the construction of the cf . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we consider the spin - isospin structure of the wf and the coupling between charged and neutral @xmath2 channels . here",
    "we also present the first fit to the experimental data .",
    "this fit encounters problem in the resonance region , and the blame for this discrepancy lies in the disregard of the small distance region . the small distance contribution to the wf",
    "is derived in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "section [ sec5 ] is devoted to the analysis of the experimental data . in section [ sec6 ]",
    "the main results are presented and open problems are formulated .",
    "as it was adumbrated above , the structure of the @xmath2 wf is rather complicated . to set the scene for the detailed treatment of the fsi in the @xmath2 system we start with a pedagogical introduction into the fsi problem in the context of femtoscopy .",
    "almost all results presented in this paragraph may be found in the literature .",
    "what we have tried here is to gather in one place the properties of the out - state wf @xmath20 needed to calculate the cf .",
    "thus our treatment does not seriously overlap with any other in the literature .",
    "there are two complete sets @xmath21 of the continuous spectrum wave functions . in @xmath22",
    "the ingoing flux is nonzero only in the direction @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "this corresponds to particles moving along @xmath26 toward the center .",
    "the flux of outgoing particles in @xmath22 consists of two parts : non - scattered ones moving along @xmath26 in the direction @xmath27 out of the center , and scattered particles moving in all directions . on the contrary , in @xmath20 ingoing particles",
    "are moving from all directions and outgoing particles are propagating only along the ray @xmath27 .",
    "asymptotically at @xmath28 both functions @xmath21 contain the same plane wave @xmath29 : @xmath30    @xmath31    coulomb interaction and channel coupling bring some distortions into these equations - see below .",
    "the following relation between @xmath22 and @xmath20 holds @xmath32    the wave function @xmath20 which is called the out - state is used to describe particles produced in some process .",
    "suppose , for example , that some state @xmath33 is created in the potential @xmath34 .",
    "then the flow of the particles with the wave vector @xmath6 emitted from the center is given by @xmath35^ { * } .\\ ] ] the out - state @xmath20 has to be used in eq .",
    "( [ bk1 ] ) for the correlation function .",
    "consider a pair of particles interacting via attractive coulomb potential ( like @xmath36 ) .",
    "the wf @xmath37 reads    @xmath38    here @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the bohr radius , @xmath41 ( = 214  fm for @xmath36 ) , @xmath42 is the reduced mass ( = 126 mev for @xmath36 ) , @xmath43 , @xmath44 is the confluent hyper - geometric function .",
    "the region @xmath45 is called the atomic energy range . in this region coulomb interaction",
    "dominates even in presence of strong interaction .",
    "the wave function is normalized so that @xmath46 is gamow s factor .    as an illustration",
    "let us take in ( [ bk1 ] ) a gaussian model for the source function @xmath47 expanding @xmath37 in @xmath48 and keeping only the first order term we obtain the following result for the correlation function ( [ bk1 ] ) : @xmath49 the partial wave expansion of the coulomb wf is given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the coulomb phase @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the regular solution of the coulomb problem @xmath54 @xmath55 asymptotically @xmath56 behaves as @xmath57 irregular solution is denoted by @xmath58 and it has the following asymptotes @xmath59    asymptotically at @xmath60 one has @xmath61    @xmath62    when the produced particles interact only via strong forces their wave function outside the interaction range ( at @xmath63  fm ) has the following form @xmath64 the radial wave function @xmath65 asymptotically behaves as @xmath66 consider now a situation when fsi is caused by the combined action of the coulomb and strong interactions .",
    "then at @xmath67 we have @xmath68 the radial wf @xmath69 is a regular solution of the schrodinger equation containing the sum of coulomb and strong potentials .",
    "an important point is that @xmath70 entering into ( [ bk20 ] ) is not identical with the pure hadronic phase shift @xmath71 in ( [ bk18 ] ) .",
    "the difference is called the coulomb correction @xcite and will be explicitly introduced later .    at @xmath72 the radial wave function in ( [ bk20 ] ) has the form @xmath73    making use of ( [ bk21 ] ) and of the expression ( [ bk10 ] ) for the coulomb wf we obtain @xmath74 where @xmath75 @xmath76 recalling the asymptotic form of @xmath37 given by eqs .",
    "( [ bk16])-([bk17 ] ) and the asymptotic behavior of @xmath77 and @xmath78 defined by eqs .",

    "this problem will be addressed in the next section .",
    "modification of the effective range expansion due to coulomb interaction is a problem whose solution is well known @xcite .",
    "here we quote the results relevant for the construction of the out - state wf @xmath79 .",
    "coulomb corrections are most important for the @xmath84-wave . the basic role in the low energy expansion is played by the effective range function @xmath85 .",
    "in @xmath84-wave we have @xmath86 here @xmath4 is the so - called schwinger s correction @xcite @xmath87 @xmath88 is eugler s constant , @xmath89 is the coulomb corrected momentum .",
    "@xmath90    @xmath91    @xmath92    with @xmath93 . in",
    "what follows the schwinger s correction will not be taken into account .",
    "the function @xmath85 has the usual effective range expansion @xmath94 similar procedure for the @xmath95-wave leads to the result @xmath96 with @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the scattering volume with the dimension @xmath99 , and @xmath100 with @xmath101 having the interpretation of the range of forces . the coulomb correction in @xmath95-wave similar to @xmath4 ( see ( [ bk26 ] ) ) can be neglected .",
    "the important feature of the @xmath2 system is the existence of the @xmath95-wave resonance @xmath102 with a width @xmath103  mev . the corresponding value of the c.m .",
    "momentum is @xmath104  mev , @xmath105 and therefore coulomb corrections in this region are small .",
    "let us recast the @xmath95-wave term ( [ bk32 ] ) into the breit - wigner form .",
    "we get @xmath106 where @xmath107 @xmath108 @xmath109 @xmath110 with @xmath111 and @xmath112 being the masses of @xmath11 and @xmath113 correspondingly , @xmath114  mev is the mass of the @xmath115 resonance , @xmath116 .",
    "the scattering volume @xmath98 is expressed in terms of the breit - wigner resonance as @xmath117",
    "up to now the spin - isospin structure of the @xmath0 wf has been disregarded . in this section",
    "we shall wind up this lacuna .",
    "it is sensible to begin by considering the angular momentum decomposition of the wf with a given isospin @xmath118 .",
    "the isospin structure of the wf as well as the coupling to the @xmath19 channel will be included at the next stage .",
    "the amplitude of meson - baryon scattering has the following form :    @xmath119    @xmath120    the second term in ( [ bk40 ] ) corresponds to the spin - flip amplitude@xmath121 .",
    "now let us write down the expression for the wf with the spin - flip term included .",
    "this expression will replace the spin - less equations ( [ bk20]),([bk22 ] ) . for any type of the interaction",
    "the conserved quantum numbers are @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "the wf having definite values of the above quantum numbers is constructed from the direct product of the wfs ( [ bk20]),([bk22 ] ) and the spin wfs    @xmath125    corresponding to @xmath126 and @xmath127 respectively .",
    "the resulting expressions read    @xmath128    @xmath129    here the symbols ( @xmath130 ) correspond to @xmath131 . in deriving ( [ bk43])-([bk44 ] ) use",

    "the low energy region of @xmath133 interaction up to the @xmath1 resonance is dominated by @xmath84- and @xmath95- waves .",
    "keeping only these two amplitudes we can rewrite ( [ bk43 ] ) as follows    @xmath134    similar expression holds for @xmath135 .",
    "the last term in ( [ bk45 ] ) corresponds to spin - flip and this contribution vanishes if @xmath136 .",
    "recalling about isospin doubling we conclude that the wf ( [ bk45 ] ) contains two @xmath84-wave amplitudes and four @xmath95-wave ones . to determine six amplitudes from femtoscopic experiments",
    "is hardly possible . to reduce the number of parameters",
    "we shall assume that the dominant interaction in @xmath95-wave occurs in a state with @xmath137 containing the @xmath13 resonance ( the amplitude @xmath138 in ( [ bk45 ] ) ) .",
    "then the number of parameters becomes equal to three .",
    "the actual number is two since the parameters of the @xmath13 resonance are known from the experiment .",
    "there might be one more parameter .",
    "the point is that expressions ( [ bk20 ] ) , ( [ bk22 ] ) , ( [ bk43]-[bk45 ] ) for the wf correspond to distances @xmath139  fm where the strong interaction is assumed to vanish .",
    "we shall address this problem in the next section and show that the contribution of the inner region is important while @xmath140 is not a relevant parameter .",
    "we now proceed to discuss the isospin structure of the wf and coupling between charged and neutral @xmath2 channels .",
    "there are two @xmath2 systems with opposite electric charges : @xmath141 and @xmath142 . for definitiveness we shall consider the charged channel @xmath143 which is coupled to the neutral channel @xmath144",

    "similar problems have been treated previously by several authors @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we shall more or less follow the approach proposed by shaw and ross @xcite . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    "we have introduced the function @xmath153 which allows to perform the effective range expansion in presence of the coulomb interaction ( see eqs.([bk27]-[bk31 ] ) ) .",
    "the generalization to the two - channel system reads @xmath154 where @xmath155 consider first the @xmath84-wave . in single channel case in the scattering length approximation one",
    "has @xmath156 ( see [ bk31 ] ) . in the two - channel case in the isospin basis",
    "one has @xmath157 where @xmath158 corresponds to @xmath17 , and @xmath159  to @xmath18 .",
    "transformation to the channel basis reads @xmath160 where the matrix @xmath161 was introduced in ( [ bk46 ] ) .",
    "according to ( [ bk47 ] ) the two - channel generalization of ( 27 ) is @xmath162 @xmath163 where as before the schwinger s correction ( [ bk28 ] ) has been neglected",
    ". we can now substitute ( [ bk51 ] ) into ( [ bk45 ] ) and obtain the closed expression for the @xmath84-wave component of the wf .",
    "however , in the two - channel case this would not be a complete answer .",
    "one should add the contribution from the coupling to the @xmath164 cnannel , i.e. , a term @xmath165 .",
    "the corresponding contribution to ( [ bk45 ] ) is @xmath166 here @xmath167 @xmath168 where @xmath169 is hankel function @xmath170 we note that @xmath171 , where @xmath172 was introduced by ( [ bk23 ] ) .",
    "as it was stated above the @xmath84-wave component of the @xmath173 wf depends upon two parameters , namely the isospin scattering lengths @xmath174 and @xmath175 . with our sign convention moderate attraction corresponds to positive signs of the scattering lengths .",
    "next we turn to the @xmath95-wave .",
    "we assume that the @xmath13 resonance with @xmath17 plays the dominant role and therefore we neglect the @xmath95-wave with @xmath18 .",
    "the resonance is coupled to both @xmath176 and @xmath177 channels . the corresponding amplitude @xmath138 and @xmath178 are evaluated using the matrix @xmath161 ( [ bk46 ] ) .",
    "denoting the resonance width in the isospin basis by @xmath179 we make the transition to the channel basis @xmath180    in line with ( [ bk34 ] ) we shall omit the coulomb corrections and write @xmath181    @xmath182    in writing ( [ bk59 ] ) we made the approximation @xmath183 two remarks are in order at this point .",
    "first , the amplitudes @xmath184 and @xmath185 are added non - coherently .",
    "this will be visualized in the expression for @xmath186 .",
    "second , in order to calculate the cf according with ( [ bk1 ] ) , or a similar equation , one has to take @xmath187 .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation since the reduced masses in @xmath176 and @xmath177 channels are close to each other .",
    "now we can collect all pieces together and write the expressions for @xmath188 and @xmath189 with coulomb interaction included in all partial waves and strong interaction in @xmath84 and @xmath95-waves .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath190 and therefore @xmath191    so , we write @xmath192    @xmath193    here @xmath194 @xmath195 equation ( [ bk64 ] ) is a sought for result which should allow to evaluate the cf according to ( [ bk1 ] ) . in the next paragraph",
    "we shall see that this is still not a complete answer .",
    "with the wf ( [ bk64 ] ) at hand we can use eq.([bk1 ] ) and try to fit the experimental data @xcite on the cf .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cf1 ] by dashed line for the fireball radii @xmath196  fm and zero scattering lengths . the low momentum region is properly described . however , in the region of the @xmath13 resonance we see a dip - bump structure instead of the experimentally observed resonant behavior .",
    "the wiggly behavior of the calculated cf is explained by the interference at @xmath197 between @xmath198 and the resonant @xmath95-wave , see ( [ bk22 ] ) , or ( [ bk44])@xmath199 .",
    "coulomb effects are not important here and for the sake of clarity they can be neglected , the phenomenon is present already in the general expression ( [ bk3 ] ) . keeping in ( [ bk22 ] ) the resonant @xmath95-wave one has    @xmath200    this leads to the interference term @xmath201 the last expression clearly displays the dip - bump behavior seen in our calculations .",
    "the same result can be derived from the expression ( [ bk64 ] ) for @xmath202 .",
    "contrary to this result the experimental points shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : cf1 ] exhibit a resonant structure .",
    "it means that something is missing in our calculations .",
    "recall that the wf - s ( [ bk43 ] ) , ( [ bk44 ] ) , ( [ bk63 ] ) correspond to the region @xmath203 where the strong potential is assumed to vanish.the contribution from the region @xmath204 is proportional to the time the impinging wave packet spends there . for the resonance",
    "this time is much larger than is needed to cross the sphere with the radius @xmath205 .",
    "we come now to a formal account of the small distance contribution .",
    "first , we split the cf ( [ bk1 ] ) into two parts @xmath206    the source function was taken out of the second integral because @xmath15 has a characteristic scale @xmath207 .",
    "the integral over the region @xmath204 entering into the last equation can not be evaluated directly since the structure of the wf at small distances is unknown .",
    "however this integral can be expressed in terms of the scattering phase shifts using the luders - wigner formula @xcite .",
    "this approach is simple and effective when fsi is dominated by a narrow resonance .",
    "otherwise one can apply the method proposed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "consider the state with @xmath208 , @xmath17 containing the @xmath13 resonance .",
    "for the radial wf @xmath209 the following relation holds @xmath210 the phase is given by @xmath211 from ( [ bk70 ] ) and ( [ bk71 ] ) we obtain after a short calculation @xmath212 where @xmath42 is the @xmath2 reduced mass",
    ". this expression may be to a high accuracy approximated by the first term only .",
    "indeed , at @xmath213 the sum of the last two terms yields @xmath214 since @xmath215 .",
    "the first term at @xmath213 is given by @xmath216 physically ( [ bk74 ] ) means that particles spend inside the small distance region the time @xmath217 which is much larger than the time @xmath218 needed to cross this region .",
    "therefore from ( [ bk70 ] ) and ( [ bk64 ] ) we obtain for the inner region contribution entering into ( [ bk69 ] ) the following result @xmath219 here the factor @xmath220 is the isospin clebsch - gordan coefficient squared , the factor @xmath221 in front of @xmath222 results from our normalization condition , see ( [ bk23 ] ) and ( [ bk54 ] ) .",

    "[ fig : cf1 ] by solid line we show the cf calculated according to ( [ bk69 ] ) with the inner region included .",

[",
    "fig : cf1 ] one should keep in mind that in different momentum intervals the cf yields different physical information . unless @xmath84-wave scattering lengths are large , which can hardly be expected for the @xmath2 system , and unless the fireball radius is anomalously small , attractive coulomb interaction becomes dominant already at @xmath234  gev / c .",
    "strong interaction effects in this region are roughly speaking proportional to @xmath235 @xmath236 and therefore negligible for @xmath237 .",

    "important information on the fireball radius and on the fsi can be inferred from the resonance region .",
    "an important point is that the resonance phenomena is very sensitive to the source size .",
    "this is illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : cf2 ] .",
    "the fit to the resonance effect allows to obtain the source size value rather reliably .",
    "based on the data points presented in @xcite we conclude that the source size is @xmath229  fm which agrees with the value obtained in @xcite where the low-@xmath239 , coulomb dominated part of the @xmath240 was selected for fitting , excluding the region of the @xmath241 peak . unlike @xcite we succeeded in describing @xmath1 resonance region .",
    "it should be however noted that the source model which we used here ( gaussian in prf ) is oversimplified .",
    "the first step toward a more realible model of the source function is suggested by the expression ( [ bk64 ] ) for the wf squared .",
    "this expression is tantamount to the expansion in terms of spherical harmonics with @xmath242 .",
    "therefore the cf can be decomposed with the @xmath243 term giving the emission point difference between @xmath113 and @xmath11 .",
    "such analysis was done in @xcite .",
    "other important points left beyond our present investigation are the influence of pions produced from resonance decays and non - gaussian tail of the source function .",
    "both factors are significant for pion and kaon production in heavy ion collisions @xcite-@xcite .",
    "experimental data on @xmath2 correlations were analyzed in @xcite with the account of these effects . roughly speaking they lead to the increase of the source size but",
    "the problem has to be carefully investigated .",
    "the same is true for the distortion of the cf by the collective flows .",
    "as demonstrated in @xcite for @xmath244 correlations with resonance formation collective flow may reduce the source size and lower the resonance peak .",
    "one should , however , keep in mind that direct production of @xmath1 may compensate this effect .",
    "we have developed a formalism to evaluate the cf for the system which comprises several features aggravating the analysis .",
    "these features are : superposition of strong and coulomb interaction , presence of a resonance , spin structure , channel coupling .",
    "we have also proposed a new method to incorporate the contribution from the small distances where the structure of the interaction is unknown .",
    "this technique which is legitimate for large enough source size has been successfully applied to the preliminary rhic data on @xmath12 correlation measurements .",
    "the gaussian source in the pair reference frame was considered .",
    "the resulting value of the source size radius is equal to @xmath229  fm .",
    "there is no sensitivity of the data to the values of the @xmath12 @xmath84-wave scattering lengths .",
    "there is a large sensitivity of the correlation function to the source size in the region of @xmath1 resonance .",
    "a good description of the @xmath1 resonance region was obtained .",
    "the developed formalism can be useful for femtoscopy studies of the systems with the narrow resonances born due to fsi e.g. @xmath245 ( @xmath246 ) .",
    "the authors would like to thank r.lednicky for numerous stimulating and clarifying discussions and remarks .",
