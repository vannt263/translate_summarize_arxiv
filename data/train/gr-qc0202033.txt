    "the well - known @xmath0-metric @xcite , @xcite is an important explicit representative of a class of spacetimes with boost - rotation symmetry @xcite .",
    "it was shown already in 1970 by kinnersley and walker @xcite that this describe a pair of uniformly accelerating black holes of masses  @xmath2 and possible charges  @xmath3 in minkowski background .",
    "the acceleration @xmath4 is caused by conical singularities which may be interpreted either as a strut between the two black holes or two semi - infinite strings connecting them to infinity .",
    "geometrical and asymptotic properties were subsequently studied in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "bonnor @xcite found a transformation of the @xmath0-metric into the boost - rotational canonical form .",
    "however , the explicit metric functions are somewhat complicated and depend on specific ranges of the initial `` static '' coordinates @xcite-@xcite .",
    "recently the limit of unbounded acceleration @xmath5 was investigated @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that such limit of the @xmath0-metric is identical to the solution which represents a spherical impulsive gravitational wave generated by a snapping string ( or an expanding strut ) @xcite-@xcite .",
    "interestingly , there exists a more general class of the @xmath0-metric solutions presented by plebanski and demianski @xcite which admits a non - vanishing value of a cosmological constant @xmath6 ( plus possibly a rotational parameter , see also @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "these solutions have already been used for investigation of the pair creation of black holes in de  sitter @xcite and anti - de  sitter backgrounds @xcite .",
    "it is also natural to expect that in the limit   @xmath5 this generalised @xmath0-metric generates a specific spherical impulsive gravitational wave in the ( anti-)de  sitter universe which may be interesting in the context of quantum and string theories .",
    "however , physical and global properties of the spacetimes @xcite with  @xmath7  have not yet been investigated thoroughly even at the classical level .",
    "only the first steps have been done . using a suitable coordinate system adapted to the motion of uniformly accelerating particles in de  sitter space the physical meaning of the parameters appearing in solutions @xcite",
    "could be determined @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the most recent paper by bik and krtou @xcite on accelerated test sources in de sitter spacetime may be of a great help for understanding the global structure of these solutions .",
    "it is the purpose of this short contribution to provide a basic physical interpretation of the above family of exact solutions with a _ negative _ value of the cosmological constant @xmath1 as uniformly accelerating black holes in anti - de  sitter universe .",
    "although this is a simple extension of our previous results presented in @xcite , we shall demonstrate that there are some interesting new features and fundamental differences from the analogous de  sitter case .",
    "anti - de  sitter universe is the ( maximally symmetric ) spacetime of constant negative curvature @xcite .",
    "it can be understood as a 4-dimensional hyperboloid @xmath8 where @xmath9 , in a 5-dimensional minkowski space @xmath10 as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "we have introduced here for later convenience the coordinates @xmath11 and @xmath12 by  @xmath13   and   @xmath14 , instead of the standard cartesian coordinates @xmath15 , @xmath16 . with the parameterisation @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 $ ] , we obtain the well - known metric in global coordinates @xmath21 \\>.    \\label{conffmetr}\\ ] ] this immediately gives the familiar penrose diagram for the anti - de  sitter space ( see fig .",
    "1 ) in which the boundary @xmath22 represents the conformal infinity @xmath23 for null and spacelike geodesics @xcite .",
    "let us consider the timelike worldlines in ( [ conffmetr ] ) of the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the proper time , and @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 are constants .",
    "the corresponding 4-velocity is  @xmath29 ,  and the 4-acceleration is  @xmath30 , with the constant modulus @xmath31 moreover , due to the relation  @xmath32 , this constant value of @xmath33 is identical to the modulus of the 3-acceleration measured in the natural local frame orthogonal to the observer s 4-velocity @xmath34 .",
    "the family of worldlines ( [ worldlines ] ) thus represents the motion of _ uniformly accelerating observers in the anti - de  sitter universe_. their trajectories are given by simple vertical lines in the penrose diagram shown in fig .  1 .",
    "for  @xmath35 the worldline is a geodesic with zero acceleration . with growing values of @xmath26",
    "the acceleration of the corresponding observers given by ( [ worldlines ] ) uniformly grows .",
    "interestingly , there exists the _",
    "maximal possible value _",
    "@xmath36 , @xmath37 of uniform acceleration of the privileged observers ( [ worldlines ] ) in the anti - de  sitter space which is reached in the limit @xmath38 , i.e. for those moving `` along the conformal infinity '' .",
    "this is completely different from the situation in the de  sitter universe , in which case the acceleration @xmath4 of analogous observers may be unbounded , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . note that such infinite acceleration corresponds to ( null ) observers in the de  siter universe which move along the cosmological horizon .",
    "this is absent in the anti - de  sitter space .    in the 5-dimensional formalism",
    "the uniformly accelerated trajectories ( [ worldlines ] ) are also privileged .",
    "it immediately follows from ( [ global ] ) that these are given by constant values of @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , the trajectories are just simple closed timelike loops of the radius @xmath41 around the anti - de  sitter hyperboloid indicated in fig",
    ".  1 .    we may now introduce a new coordinate system which is well adapted to description of uniformly accelerating test point sources in the anti - de  sitter space .",
    "this analogue of the accelerated coordinates for the de  sitter spacetime @xcite is given by the following parameterisation of the hyperboloid ( [ fourhyp ] ) , @xmath42 where  @xmath43 ,  @xmath44 , and @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "in these coordinates , the anti - de  sitter space takes the form @xmath46 ^ 2 } \\bigg\\ {   - { \\left(1+{r^2/ a^2}\\right ) } \\,\\d t^2   + { \\d r^2\\over { 1+{r^2/a^2 } } } + r^2(\\d \\theta^2+\\sin^2\\theta\\,\\d\\phi^2 ) \\ > \\bigg\\ } \\>.    \\label{accmetr}\\ ] ] in the case @xmath47 this static metric reduces to the standard form ( [ conffmetr ] ) if we perform obvious transformations @xmath48 , and @xmath49",
    ". moreover , the metric ( [ accmetr ] ) is conformal to this for a general value of the acceleration @xmath50 .",
    "the explicit transformation between ( [ conffmetr ] ) and ( [ accmetr ] ) is obtained by comparing ( [ global ] ) with ( [ acceler ] ) , @xmath51 which relate @xmath52 to @xmath53 ( the coordinates @xmath54 and @xmath55 have the same meaning in both the metrics ) .",
    "it is obvious from the first relation in ( [ rtheta ] ) that the origin  @xmath56  of the coordinates ( [ accmetr ] ) corresponds to  @xmath57 , i.e.  @xmath58 .  from ( [ a ] )",
    "we immediately conclude that the parameter @xmath4 in the metric ( [ accmetr ] ) is exactly the value of the acceleration of the corresponding observer .",
    "therefore , _ the origin  @xmath56  of the coordinates in _ ( [ accmetr ] ) _ is accelerating in anti - de  sitter universe with uniform acceleration @xmath4_. it also follows from ( [ rtheta ] ) that the coordinate singularity  @xmath56  is located at  @xmath59 when  @xmath60 , whereas it is located at  @xmath61 when  @xmath62 . considering ( [ acceler ] ) we finally observe that the trajectory of uniformly accelerating origin   @xmath56   corresponds to a uniform motion of a single point around the anti - de  sitter hyperboloid .",
    "this closed trajectory is a circle of radius   @xmath63 ,  which is given by an intersection of the hyperboloid ( [ fourhyp ] ) with the plane having the constant values  @xmath64and   @xmath65 , see fig .  1 .",
    "the plebanski  demianski solution for the @xmath0-metric with a cosmological constant can be written in the form @xcite @xmath67 where @xmath68 note that we do not consider the possible rotation here .",
    "also , we have used the coordinate freedom to remove the linear terms in ( [ pq ] ) , and to set the coefficients of the quadratic terms to unity . in order to maintain the spacetime signature ,",
    "it is necessary that @xmath69 which places a restriction on the range of @xmath70 .",
    "however , there is no restriction on the sign of @xmath71 which may describe both static and non - static regions , separated by horizons localised on @xmath72 . using the standard `` descartes sign rule ''",
    "we obtain for  @xmath73 and @xmath74 that the polynomial @xmath75 given by ( [ pq ] ) has at most _ four _ real roots @xmath76 ( three positive and one negative ) . on the other hand , the polynomial @xmath77 has at most _ two _ real ( necessarily negative ) roots @xmath78 .",
    "there are thus four possible static spacetime regions for all permitted values of @xmath70 and @xmath79 , as illustrated in fig .  2 by the shaded areas .",
    "these are bounded by horizons @xmath78 and `` coordinate '' singularities @xmath76 . in the following",
    "we shall concentrate on the spacetime for which  @xmath80  and  @xmath81   ( note that  @xmath82 corresponds to the spacetime boundary on which the conformal factor in ( [ cmetric ] ) becomes unbounded , whereas @xmath83 represents a curvature singularity ) .",
    "this covers one non - static plus two static regions separated by inner and outer black hole horizons , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively .",
    "again , this is different from the de  sitter case for which _ both _ the polynomials @xmath86 and @xmath71 may have up to four real roots so that an additional cosmological horizon ( on @xmath87 ) is present",
    ".    let us perform the coordinate transformation of the metric ( [ cmetric ] ) given by @xmath88 where  @xmath89 , and @xmath90 is a constant .",
    "we obtain @xmath91 ^ 2}\\ ,   \\bigg\\ { -    f(r)\\,\\d t^2 + { \\d r^2\\over f(r ) } + r^2\\big(\\,\\d \\theta^2 + g^2(\\theta)\\,c^2\\d\\phi^2 \\big ) \\bigg\\}\\   ,   \\label{newmetric}\\ ] ] in which @xmath92 and @xmath93 is the inverse function of @xmath94 given by the integral in ( [ transf ] ) .",
    "it may be seen that , either when  @xmath47 or when both  @xmath95  and  @xmath96 ,  we obtain @xmath97  so that  @xmath98 .  otherwise these can be expressed in terms of jacobian elliptic functions @xcite .",
    "it is obvious that for @xmath47 , @xmath99 the metric ( [ newmetric ] ) exactly reduces to the familiar form of the reissner  nordstrm ",
    "anti - de  sitter black hole solution in which the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 have the usual interpretation and the curvature singularity is located at @xmath56 .",
    "moreover , when @xmath100 , @xmath99 and @xmath101 , the line element ( [ newmetric ] ) is _ identical _ to ( [ accmetr ] ) in which @xmath56 corresponds to a uniformly accelerating single point in the anti - de  sitter background .",
    "when @xmath2 and @xmath3 are small , the solution ( [ newmetric ] ) can naturally be regarded as a perturbation of ( [ accmetr ] ) .",
    "the metric ( [ newmetric ] ) can thus be interpreted as describing _ a charged black hole which is uniformly accelerating in anti - de  sitter universe_.    the spacetimes given by the metric ( [ newmetric ] ) explicitly possess the boost and rotation symmetries corresponding to the killing vectors @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "there are killing horizons where the norm of the killing vector @xmath102 vanishes .",
    "these occur on @xmath104 and separate static and non - static regions of the spacetimes . generally , for @xmath105 , @xmath106 there are at most two real roots of @xmath107 which correspond to the familiar inner and outer black hole horizons in the reissner ",
    "anti - de  sitter spacetimes , see e.g. @xcite-@xcite .",
    "their specific geometrical properties depend not only on the parameters @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath1 , but also on the acceleration @xmath4 .",
    "contrary to the de  sitter background there is no cosmological horizon .",
    "cases representing uniformly accelerating extreme black holes or naked singularities in anti - de  sitter universe are also described by ( [ newmetric ] ) for specific ranges of the parameters such that the two possible roots of @xmath108 are repeated or absent .    for @xmath109 and a general choice of the parameters @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath1 ,",
    "the complete global structure of the spacetime is complicated . of course",
    ", for small @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the solutions ( [ newmetric ] ) can be considered as perturbations of anti - de  sitter universe illustrated in fig .  1 .",
    "however , these pictures now are only schematic since  @xmath56  is not a single `` test '' point but a curvature singularity , and the black hole horizons also occur . for vanishing acceleration @xmath4 ,",
    "the conformal diagrams of the corresponding ( spherically symmetric ) spacetimes are already known @xcite-@xcite .",
    "interestingly , these diagrams also describe the global structure of the complete spacetime ( [ newmetric ] ) _ in the `` equatorial '' plane @xmath110 _ orthogonal to the direction of acceleration , even in the case when @xmath100 . on this plane",
    ", @xmath111 corresponds to the anti - de  sitter conformal infinity @xmath23 which is represented by the boundary @xmath22 in fig .  1 .",
    "we finally clarify the character of the singularities at @xmath112  and  @xmath113   which are the roots of  @xmath114 .",
    "it follows from the integral in ( [ transf ] ) that  @xmath115 corresponds to  @xmath116 ,  whereas  @xmath117  to  @xmath118 , in which @xmath119 is the `` quarter period '' , i.e. the complete elliptic integral of the first kind related to ( [ transf ] ) .",
    "( when either  @xmath47  or  @xmath120 we obtain @xmath121 . )",
    "therefore , the range of the `` angular '' coordinates in the metric ( [ newmetric ] ) is  @xmath122 $ ] ,  @xmath12 .",
    "as in the de  sitter case @xcite we may compare the circumference of a small circle around the pole @xmath116 with its radius ( for any fixed value of @xmath123 and @xmath54 ) .",
    "we find that in general there is a deficit angle @xmath124 = 2\\pi \\left[\\ , 1-c\\,g'(0 ) \\right]\\ , \\label{delta1}\\ ] ] where   @xmath125 , which is finite and independent of @xmath123 and @xmath54 .",
    "thus , the singularity at  @xmath115  represents a _ cosmic string of constant tension _ along the semi - axis  @xmath116 .  of course , for any value of the physical parameters @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath1 , this can always be made regular by putting  @xmath126 .",
    "in particular , if  @xmath47 ( the case of spherically symmetric reissner  nordstrm",
    " anti - de  sitter spacetime ) ,  or if @xmath2 and @xmath3 are both zero ( the anti - de  sitter universe in accelerating coordinates ) , the semi - axis  @xmath127 is regular when  @xmath128 because  @xmath129 in these cases .    the deficit angle of the second cosmic string which extends in the opposite direction  @xmath130 is @xmath131 = 2\\pi \\left[\\ , 1+c\\,g'(2k ) \\,\\right]\\ , \\label{delta2}\\ ] ] where  @xmath132 .",
    "again , the string along the semi - axis  @xmath130 can be removed by setting  @xmath133 .",
    "however , it is not possible in general to remove the strings in both directions simultaneously unless  @xmath134 .",
    "this condition can only be satisfied for  @xmath135 or  @xmath136 ( in which case  @xmath137 ) with  @xmath99 .",
    "thus , uniformly accelerating black hole in anti - de  sitter universe must necessarily be connected to at least one cosmic string localised at  @xmath127 and/or  @xmath138 , which may be considered to `` cause '' the acceleration ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this is in accordance with the same result obtained in minkowski @xcite or de  sitter @xcite , @xcite space .",
    "there are no ( non - trivial ) self - accelerating black holes in the backgrounds of constant curvature .    however , there are fundamental geometrical differences between the cases with positive and negative value of the cosmological constant @xmath1 . in the de  sitter case , there are _ two _ uniformly accelerating black holes connected each other by finite string(s ) . in the presence of both strings",
    "these make a complete _ circular loop _ around the whole closed de  sitter universe . in the anti - de  sitter background",
    ", there is just a _ single _ uniformly accelerating black hole attached to _ semi - infinite _",
    "open string(s ) .",
    "these have a `` hyperboloidal '' character and connect the black hole to the anti - de  sitter conformal infinity @xmath23 . indeed , if we treat the solution ( [ newmetric ] ) for sufficiently small  @xmath139 and   @xmath140 as a perturbation of the anti - de  sitter hyperboloid ( [ fourhyp ] ) , the first string is localised along  @xmath127 whereas the second along  @xmath141 . considering ( [ acceler ] ) we observe that both these cases correspond to  @xmath142 . from ( [ fourhyp ] )",
    "it follows that the geometry of such strings in anti - de  sitter universe is given by a hyperboloidal 2-surface  @xmath143 .",
    "the position of the strings at a given time is indicated in fig .  1 by the wavy line .",
    "the first semi - infinite string localised on  @xmath127 connects the uniformly accelerated source  @xmath144 to the infinity @xmath23 on the `` left '' ,  @xmath145 , while the second string on  @xmath141 extends from the source in the opposite direction to the `` right '' ,  @xmath146 .",
