    "the one - electron models of solids are based on the study of schrdinger operator with periodic potential .",

    "@xcite is the best guide to this field for readers ) .",

    "the positive sign of @xmath6 corresponds the repulsive interaction , while the negative one corresponds the attractive one .",
    "more precisely , @xmath0 is the negative laplacian with boundary conditions on integer points : @xmath9 where @xmath10 here @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the usual sobolev space of order @xmath13 on the open set @xmath14 . from sobolev s embedding theorem @xmath15 ,",
    "every elements of @xmath16 are continuous ( classical sense ) and uniformly bounded functions .",
    "it is well - known that @xmath0 is self - adjoint and is a model describing electrons on the quantum wire .",
    "the spectrum of this model is explicitly given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 @xmath19 is so - called _ discriminant _ and @xmath20 can be regarded as an entire function with respect to @xmath21 .",
    "the spectrum @xmath22 of @xmath0 consists of infinitely many closed intervals ( spectral bands ) and is purely absolutely continuous .    on the other hand , for the schrdinger operator @xmath23 on @xmath24 with decaying potential @xmath6 ,",
    "the _ dispersive estimate _ for the schrdinger time evolution operator @xmath2 is stated as follows : @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the spectral projection to the absolutely continuous subspace for @xmath0 .",
    "the dispersive estimate is a quantitative representation of the diffusion phenomena in quantum mechanics , and is extensively studied recently , because of its usefulness in the theory of the non - linear schrdinger operator ( see e.g.   journ ",
    "sogge @xcite , weder @xcite , yajima @xcite , mizutani @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the estimate ( [ dispersive_estimate ] ) is also obtained in the case of the one - dimensional point interaction .",

    "sacchetti @xcite when @xmath6 is the sum of @xmath27 potentials at two points .",
    "the motivation of the present paper is to obtain a similar estimate for our periodic model ( [ kronig - penney0 ] ) .",
    "though this problem is quite fundamental , we could not find such kind of results in the literature , probably because the deduction of the result requires a detailed analysis of the band functions , as we shall see below .",
    "since the spectrum of the schrdinger operator with periodic potential is absolutely continuous , one may expect some dispersion type estimate holds also in this case",
    ". however , there seems to be few results about the dispersive type estimate for the time evolution operator of the differential equation with periodic coefficients .",
    "an example is the paper by cuccagna @xcite , in which the klein ",
    "gordon equation @xmath28 is considered , where @xmath29 is a smooth real - valued periodic function with period @xmath30 .",
    "cuccagna proves the solution @xmath31 satisfies @xmath32 for @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is some bounded discrete set .",
    "the peculiar power @xmath35 comes from the following reason .",
    "the integral kernel for the time evolution operator is written as the sum of oscillatory integrals @xmath36 where @xmath37+x'$ ] , @xmath38+y'$ ] , @xmath39,[y]\\in\\mathbf{z}$ ] , @xmath40 , and @xmath41-[y])/t$ ] .",
    "the function @xmath42 is called the _ band function _ for the @xmath43-th band , which is a real - analytic function of @xmath44 with period @xmath45 . in the large time limit @xmath4 , it is well - known that the main contribution of the oscillatory integral ( [ intro0 ] ) comes from the part nearby the _ stationary phase point _",
    "@xmath46 ( the solution of @xmath47 ) , and the _ stationary phase method _ tells us the principal term in the asymptotic bound is a constant multiple of @xmath48 ( see e.g.  stein ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter viii ) or lemma [ lemma_stein ] below ) .",
    "however , since @xmath42 is a periodic function , there exists a point @xmath49 so that @xmath50 .",
    "if the stationary phase point @xmath46 coincides with @xmath49 , then the previous bound no longer makes sense .",
    "instead , the stationary phase method concludes the principal term is a constant multiple of @xmath51 .",
    "since the integral kernel of our operator has the same form as ( [ intro0 ] ) ( see ( [ st01 ] ) below ) , we expect a result similar to ( [ cuccagna ] ) also holds in our case .",
    "let us formulate our main result .",
    "let @xmath0 be the hamiltonian for the kronig - penney model given in ( [ kronig - penney1 ] ) and ( [ kronig - penney2 ] ) . as stated above",
    ", the spectrum of @xmath0 has the band structure , that is , @xmath52 where the @xmath43-th band @xmath53 is a closed interval of finite length ( for the precise definition , see ( [ bloch13 ] ) below ) .",
    "our main result is as follows .",
    "[ theorem_main ] let @xmath54 be the spectral projection onto the @xmath43-th energy band @xmath53 .",

    "the coefficients obey the bound @xmath61 as @xmath62 .",
    "the power @xmath63 in the first term of the coefficient in ( [ main1 ] ) is the same as in ( [ dispersive_estimate ] ) with @xmath64 and @xmath65 , since it comes from the states corresponding to the energy near the band center , which behaves like a free particle .",
    "this fact can be understood from the graph of @xmath66 ( figure [ figure_band_function ] ) .",
    "the part of the graph corresponding to the band center is similar to the parabola @xmath67 or its translation , which is the band function for the free hamiltonian @xmath68 . on the other hand ,",
    "the power @xmath35 comes from part of the integral ( [ intro0 ] ) given by @xmath69 where @xmath70 is some open set including two solutions @xmath49 to the equation @xmath71 .",
    "notice that @xmath72 is an inflection point in the graph of @xmath66 ; see figure [ figure_band_function ] .",
    "the estimates for the coefficients are obtained from the lower bounds for the derivatives of @xmath42 .",
    "actually , we can choose @xmath70 so that @xmath73\\setminus j_n}|\\lambda_n''(\\theta)|\\geq c,\\quad    \\inf_{\\theta\\in j_n}|\\lambda_n^{(3)}(\\theta)|\\geq c n^{1/3},\\ ] ] where @xmath74 is a positive constant independent of @xmath43 . by ( [ intro2 ] ) and the estimates for the amplitude function ( proposition [ proposition_amplitude1 ] ) , we can prove theorem [ theorem_main ] by using a lemma for estimating oscillatory integrals , given in stein s book ( see stein @xcite or lemma [ lemma_stein ] below ) .",
    "we can also prove the power @xmath35 is optimal , by considering the case @xmath75 ( so , @xmath49 is a stationary phase point ) , and applying the asymptotic expansion formula in the stationary phase method ( see e.g.  stein ( * ? ? ?",
    "* page 334 ) ) .",
    "( @xmath76 ) for @xmath77 .",
    "the range of @xmath42 is the @xmath43-th band @xmath53 .",
    "we find two inflection points of @xmath66 near @xmath78 , for every @xmath43 .",
    ", width=302 ]    the physical implication of the result is as follows . by definition , the parameter @xmath41-[y])/t$ ] represents the _ propagation velocity _ of a quantum particle .",
    "the wave packet with energy near @xmath79 has the maximal group speed in the @xmath43-th band , and the speed of the quantum diffusion is slowest in that band .",
    "thus such state has a bit longer life - span ( in the sense of @xmath80-norm ) than the ordinary state has ; the state is in some sense a _ resonant state _ , caused by the meeting of two stationary phase points @xmath46 as @xmath81 tends to @xmath82 .",
    "it is well - known that the existence of resonant states makes the decay of the solution with respect to @xmath83 slower ( see jensen  kato @xcite or mizutani @xcite ) .    since",
    "the estimate ( [ main1 ] ) is given bandwise , it is natural to ask we can obtain the dispersive type estimate for the whole schrdinger time evolution operator @xmath2 , like cuccagna s result ( [ cuccagna ] ) .",
    "however , it turns out to be difficult in the present case , from the following reason . a reasonable strategy to prove such estimate is as follows .",
    "first , we divide the integral @xmath84 into two parts @xmath85 and the rest , where @xmath85 is given in ( [ intro1 ] ) with @xmath70 some open set including @xmath86 .",
    "next , we show the sum of @xmath85 converges and gives @xmath3 , and the sum of the rests also converges and gives @xmath87 .",
    "however , for fixed @xmath88 and @xmath89 , we find that our upper bound for @xmath90 is not better than @xmath91 , and the sum of the upper bounds does not converge ( see the last part of section 4 ) .",
    "one reason for this divergence is very strong singularity of our potential , the sum of @xmath27-functions .",
    "because of this singularity , the width of the band gap , say @xmath92 ( @xmath43 is the band number ) , does not decay at all in the high energy limit @xmath93 .",
    "implies @xmath94 as @xmath93 . ]",
    "then we can not take the open set @xmath70 so small , in the proof of theorem [ theorem_main ] . ] and the sum of the lengths @xmath95 diverges ; if this sum converges , we can use a simple bound @xmath96 to control the sum .",
    "thus we do not succeed to obtain a bound for the sum of @xmath90 at present .    on the other hand , for the schrdinger operator @xmath97 on @xmath98 with real - valued periodic potential @xmath6",
    ", it is known that the decay rate of the width of the band gap @xmath92 reflects the smoothness of the potential @xmath6 .",
    "hochstadt @xcite says @xmath99 if @xmath6 is in @xmath100 , and trubowitz @xcite says @xmath101 ( @xmath102 is some positive constant ) if @xmath6 is real analytic .",
    "so , if @xmath6 is sufficiently smooth , it is expected that we can control the sum of @xmath85 , and obtain the dispersive type estimate for the whole operator @xmath2 ( i.e.  ( [ main1 ] ) without the projection @xmath54 ) .",
    "we hope to argue this matter elsewhere in the near future .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we review the floquet  bloch theory for our operator @xmath0 and give the explicit form of the integral kernel of @xmath2 . in section 3 , we give more concrete analysis for the band functions , especially give some estimates for the derivatives . in section 4",
    ", we prove theorem [ theorem_main ] , and give some comment for the summability with respect to @xmath43 of the estimates ( [ main1 ] ) .",
