    "heavy - ion fusion reactions are a sensitive probe of the size and structure of atomic nuclei  @xcite .",
    "recent experiments with radioactive ion beams allow for the study of heavy - ion fusion with exotic nuclei .",
    "for instance , enhanced fusion - evaporation cross sections have been observed with neutron - rich @xmath0 beams on @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the synthesis of superheavy nuclei in hot and cold fusion reactions  @xcite represents another experimental frontier .",
    "in general , the fusion cross sections depend on the interaction potential and form factors in the vicinity of the coulomb barrier .",
    "furthermore , experiments on subbarrier fusion have demonstrated a strong dependence of the total fusion cross section on nuclear deformation  @xcite .",
    "the dependence on nuclear orientation has received particular attention for the formation of heavy and superheavy elements  @xcite and various entrance channel models have been developed to predict its role in enhancing or diminishing the probability for fusion  @xcite .",
    "while this may be true for heavy systems , the orientation effects should influence the fusion process for light nuclei as well .",
    "there are several theoretical methods for calculating heavy - ion fusion cross sections : a ) barrier penetration models  @xcite , b ) coupled - channels calculations  @xcite , and c ) microscopic many - body approaches such as the time - dependent hartree - fock ( tdhf ) method  @xcite .    in recent coupled - channels calculations of heavy - ion fusion reactions",
    ", one typically uses the `` rotating frame approximation ''  @xcite which assumes that the orbital angular momentum @xmath2 of relative motion is conserved ; this approximation avoids the full angular momentum coupling and thus reduces the number of coupled channels considerably .",
    "one tends to use empirical interaction potentials which are mostly real and energy - independent ( woods - saxon potential , proximity - type potentials , double - folding potential ) .",
    "an imaginary potential is unnecessary because one takes into account explicitly all channel couplings that affect fusion .",
    "coupling potentials are usually obtained utilizing macroscopic nuclear structure models ( e.g. rotational model or harmonic vibrator ) .",
    "the coupled - channel equations are solved numerically with standard scattering boundary conditions at @xmath3 , and an incoming - wave boundary condition at some point @xmath4 inside the coulomb barrier .",
    "the fusion cross section is obtained from the incoming flux at @xmath5 .",
    "fusion in the tdhf collision process is achieved when the relative kinetic energy in the entrance channel is entirely converted into internal excitations of a single well defined compound nucleus . in the tdhf theory the dissipation of relative kinetic energy into internal excitations is due to the collisions of the nucleons with the `` walls '' of the self - consistent mean - field potential .",
    "tdhf studies demonstrate that the randomization of the single - particle motion occurs through repeated exchange of nucleons from one nucleus into the other .",
    "consequently , the equilibration of excitations is very slow and it is sensitive to the details of the evolution of the shape of the composite system . if one of the nuclei is deformed , one needs to carry out tdhf fusion calculations on a 3-d lattice for different relative orientations of the nuclei as they approach each other on a rutherford trajectory , and afterwords one has to perform a suitable average over all orientations . depending on the incident energy and impact parameter",
    ", some relative orientations may contribute to fusion while others may not . in lowest - order approximation",
    ", one might assume that all relative orientations of the intrinsic axis system occur with equal probability .",
    "this is indeed a reasonable approximation for relatively light nuclei where coulomb excitation is negligible .",
    "however , in heavier systems , the dynamical alignment of the deformed nucleus as a result of multiple e2 and e4 coulomb excitation of the ground state rotational band may no longer be ignored and results in a definite preferential alignment of the deformed nucleus which must be taken into account when calculating the fusion cross section .",
    "there are a very limited number of tdhf collision studies involving deformed nuclei , and almost all of these were done in an axial geometry using the `` rotating frame approximation '' , and thus could not address the orientation dependence of reaction cross sections .",
    "recently , we have developed a new tdhf code which assumes no symmetries regarding both the collision geometry and the skyrme effective interaction  @xcite and utilizes the modern skyrme force parametrizations , including the time - odd terms .",
    "the numerical calculations are performed on a large 3-d cartesian lattice using the basis spline collocation method  @xcite for increased accuracy . in this work",
    "we shall use this code to study fusion cross sections in the collisions of spherical+deformed nuclei .",
    "the theoretical formalism for calculating the fusion cross section is outlined in section  [ sec : fus_theory ] . in section  [ sec : results ] we present fusion calculations carried out using this approach . in section  [ sec : summary ]",
    "a summary and outlook is provided .",
    "the evaluation of the heavy - ion collision dynamics can be divided into two separate steps : a ) a dynamical coulomb alignment calculation to determine the probability that a given nuclear orientation occurs at the distance @xmath6 , where the tdhf run is initialized .",
    "the distance @xmath6 is chosen such that the nuclei only interact via the coulomb interaction .",
    "b ) a tdhf calculation , starting at this finite internuclear distance @xmath6 , for a fixed initial orientation of the deformed nucleus .      for a given incident energy @xmath7 and impact parameter @xmath8 , we carry out a semiclassical coulomb excitation calculation of the dominant ground state rotational band of the deformed nucleus ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rot_band ] ) .",
    "the coulomb excitation calculation starts at very large internuclear distances ( about @xmath9 fm ) when both nuclei may be presumed to be in their respective ground states .",
    "we have provided the details of this formalism in the appendix .",
    "coulomb excitation of the ground state rotational band members via multiple e2 and e4 transitions . ]",
    "[ fig : prob_of_t ] shows a representative result in medium - mass nuclei , @xmath10 , where we plot the excitation probability of the @xmath11 ground state rotational band members as a function of time . in the coulomb excitation code , we utilize the measured energy levels of the ground state rotational band in @xmath11 up to the @xmath12 level @xcite .",
    "we also use experimental values for the reduced transition probabilities @xcite @xmath13 and @xmath14 from which one can calculate all remaining e2 and e4 matrix elements within the collective rotor model . in this semiclassical calculation , one can see how the nucleus `` climbs up the rotational band '' during the collision .",
    "negative times in fig .",
    "[ fig : prob_of_t ] correspond to the incoming branch of the rutherford trajectory , and positive times correspond to the outgoing branch .",
    "the distance of closest approach is reached at @xmath15 .",
    "( alternatively , one can plot the excitation probability as a function of the internuclear distance ) .",
    "the coulomb excitation amplitudes , @xmath16 , give rise to a preferential orientation ( alignment ) .",
    "the dynamic alignment formalism presented in the appendix allows us to follow the nuclear alignment as a function of the internuclear distance vector @xmath17 .",
    "we would like to stress that the quantity which enters in our tdhf fusion calculations is not the coulomb alignment after the reaction has taken place ( at @xmath18 ) but rather the alignment at the _ finite internuclear distance _ @xmath19 on the incoming branch of the rutherford trajectory .",
    "coulomb excitation probability of the @xmath20 members of the ground state rotational band in @xmath11 as a function of time .",
    "the deformed nucleus is excited with a @xmath1 beam at @xmath21 mev at impact parameter @xmath22 . ]    in the case of a spherical+deformed system , the relative orientation of the deformed nucleus may be specified by the three euler angles @xmath23 relative to the collision plane as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : align_schem ] .",
    "we use here the definition of the euler angles given in ref .",
    "multiple coulomb excitation predominantly excites the members of the @xmath24 ground state rotational band which preserves an axially symmetric shape ; hence , rotations about the symmetry axis @xmath25 described by the euler angle @xmath26 are irrelevant ( see appendix ) .     the orientation of the intrinsic body - fixed frame of the deformed target nucleus is specified by the three euler angles @xmath23 relative to the collision plane . ]",
    "subsequent to the determination of the initial conditions for the two nuclei ,",
    "as described in the previous section , we perform a tdhf calculation to establish the outcome of the collision process . in tdhf , for a given set of initial conditions ( energy , impact parameter , orientation , etc . ) , only one outcome is possible , thus we define @xmath27 where @xmath8 is the asymptotic impact parameter , @xmath7 is the associated center of mass energy , and quantities @xmath28 and @xmath29 denote the orientation angles discussed above . the total fusion cross section may be written as @xmath30 the probability for fusion is given in terms of the differential probability @xmath31 where the euler angle solid angle element is given by @xmath32 , and @xmath33 since for a given @xmath7 value and angles @xmath34 the tdhf fusion probability is either zero or unity we can instead write the integrals over the impact parameter to terminate at @xmath35 , where @xmath35 denotes the maximum impact parameter for fusion for orientation angles @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "this allows us to write @xmath36 the differential cross section given in eq .",
    "( [ sig4 ] ) in terms of euler angles should not be confused with the laboratory differential cross section given in terms of the scattering angles .",
    "the differential orientation probability used in eq .",
    "( [ sig4 ] ) is evaluated in the appendix , eq .",
    "( [ eq : orient_prob ] ) .",
    "in order to gain a better insight into the differential orientation probability mentioned above we have performed calculations for systems that involve two heavy reaction partners and for systems which are composed of two light nuclei .",
    "we first examine the dynamical orientation , due to multiple e2/e4 coulomb excitations , of the deformed nucleus @xmath37dy colliding with a spherical @xmath38ni nucleus at @xmath39 mev . in a central collision ( impact parameter @xmath22 ) ,",
    "the orientation probability of an even - even nucleus is independent of the euler angle @xmath29 because , starting from the @xmath40 ground state , only magnetic substates @xmath41 of the ground state rotational band are excited .",
    "therefore , the orientation probability depends only on the euler angle @xmath28 in this case ( see appendix , eq .",
    "[ eq : orient_prob ] ) .",
    "[ fig : align_ni_dy ] shows the orientation probability for two values of the internuclear distance . at very large distance",
    "( @xmath42 fm ) before the collision where the deformed nucleus is in its @xmath40 ground state , all euler angles @xmath28 occur with equal probability , and there is no preferential alignment .",
    "however , at an internuclear distance of @xmath43 fm ( where @xmath44 and @xmath45 denote the mean square nuclear radii ) , we observe substantial alignment preference . clearly , the perpendicular orientation ( @xmath46 ) is preferred over the parallel ( @xmath47 ) orientation , with an alignment ratio @xmath48 .",
    "the reason for this preferred alignment is easily understood in terms of classical electrostatics : for a given internuclear distance @xmath49 , the perpendicular orientation of the deformed nucleus minimizes the coulomb interaction energy which is proportional to @xmath50 .",
    "dynamic alignment due to coulomb excitation of @xmath51dy by a @xmath52ni beam .",

    "we have repeated the above analysis to study the coulomb excitation of the deformed nucleus @xmath54 in a central collision with an @xmath55 nucleus . in the coulomb excitation code , we utilize the measured energy levels of the @xmath56 rotational band up to the @xmath57 level @xcite . the @xmath58 value is computed from the measured halflife @xcite @xmath59 , and the remaining e2 matrix elements are determined from the collective rotor model .",

    "shown is the orientation probability as a function of the euler angle @xmath28 in a central collision at internuclear distances @xmath62 fm ( blue curve ) and at @xmath63 fm ( red curve ) . ]",
    "[ fig : align_ox_ne ] shows the corresponding orientation probability for these two light nuclei . despite the much higher incident energy of @xmath64 mev ( about @xmath65 times the coulomb barrier height ) , we observe only a very small alignment preference : @xmath66 .",
    "there are two aspects pertaining to the importance of dynamical alignment in calculating fusion cross sections . in the case where all orientations lead to fusion",
    "the alignment probability provides a properly weighted sum for calculating the fusion cross section using eq .",
    "( [ sig2 ] ) . however , implicit in the above expression is also the fact that for different orientations we will have different values for @xmath67 .",
    "thus , even in a case where the central collision leads to fusion for all orientations of the deformed nucleus , and even if the coulomb excitation probabilities are angle - independent , we still have different contributions to the fusion cross section arising from different orientations .",
    "+       in order to demonstrate the points made above we have performed tdhf calculations for the @xmath68 system at @xmath64 mev .",
    "we have chosen this light system at a relatively high beam energy so that we can perform the numerical calculations faster .",
    "we have used our new tdhf code  @xcite , which works in 3-d and uses modern skyrme forces , including the time - odd terms . for this work we have used the sly4 parametrization  @xcite . in this case",
    "hartree - fock calculations result in a spherical @xmath69 nucleus and a @xmath56 nucleus with strong axial deformation .",
    "when no spatial symmetries are assumed hartree - fock calculations generate an orientation for the intrinsic coordinate system , with respect to the code coordinate system , typically determined by the choice for the initial single particle states , e.g. harmonic oscillators . depending on the order in which the cartesian oscillator shells are filled",
    "we get a particular orientation for the nucleus .",
    "different orientations with euler angle @xmath70 can be generated by rotating the coordinate frame in which the initial single particle states are created with respect to the code frame .",
    "the resulting states will then be oriented with euler angle @xmath28 with respect to the code frame . a subsequent rotation perpendicular to this direction",
    "would then generate the @xmath29 rotation .",
    "the hartree - fock iterations in generating the static solutions preserve this orientation since in an unrestricted geometry all orientations are exactly equivalent .",
    "we have performed calculations by keeping the angle @xmath29 fixed at @xmath71 and varying the angle @xmath28 in @xmath72 intervals . at this energy ,",
    "all angles up to @xmath73 do not show any fusion for head - on collisions , whereas larger angles fuse . for each of the orientations leading to fusion",
    "we have made a sweep over the impact parameter to find the maximum impact parameter for fusion .",
    "this was initially done in @xmath74  fm steps and reduced down to @xmath75  fm when the approximate fusion boundary was located . for large impact parameters",
    "the system undergoes multiple revolutions before fusion or deep - inelastic collision . starting from an initial separation of @xmath76  fm",
    "we have followed most of the collisions to about @xmath77  fm / c .",
    "angles smaller than @xmath73 contribute to the deep - inelastic channel . for these orientations a study of the central collisions show a gradual decrease in the translational kinetic energy between the two final fragments , ranging from almost @xmath78  mev for @xmath79 to about @xmath80  mev for @xmath81 .",
    "we also observe particle transfer between the fragments , in most of the cases the final fragments seem to have exchanged one neutron from the neon to the oxygen . in the fusion regime",

    "to date most tdhf calculations have been limited to the study of collisions involving spherical systems .",
