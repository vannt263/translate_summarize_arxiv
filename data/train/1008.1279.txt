    "symmetry has played a fundamental role in the construction of field theories purporting to describe fundamental physics . nowhere is this more true than in the construction of the minimal supersymmetric standard model where symmetries mixing bosonic and fermionic states lead to tightly constrained theories often exhibiting remarkable properties .",
    "this is particularly true for @xmath0 extended supersymmetric yang - mills theories @xcite , which are known to be finite .    in this note",
    "we construct field theories which exhibit @xmath0 extended supersymmetry and lorentz violation .",
    "to do so we combine ideas of berger and kosteleck @xcite involving supersymmetric scalar theories exhibiting lorentz violation , and well - known constructions of extended supersymmetric theories involving dimensional reduction ( nicely described in the work of brink , schwartz and scherk@xcite ) .",
    "we begin by establishing notation in the context of the standard construction .",

    "more precisely , introduce four independent anticommuting variables , @xmath8 and consider the general vector superfield @xmath9 + \\frac{1}{2}(\\bar{\\theta}\\theta)^2(d(x ) -\\frac{1}{2}\\partial_\\mu\\partial^\\mu c(x))\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the @xmath10 operator q= -i _",
    "| -^_. fixing an arbitrary spinor @xmath11 standard analysis@xcite of the operator @xmath12 leads to the supersymmetry transformations defining an @xmath13 supersymmetric theory .",
    "following berger and kosteleck@xcite , we introduce lorentz violation by defining a twisted derivative : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a symmetric , traceless , dimensionless tensor parametrizing lorentz violation . to obtain a gauge invariant theory",
    ", we also twist the underlying connection : ^= a^+ k^ a_. these perturbations lead to a general vector superfield @xmath16 + \\frac{1}{2}(\\bar{\\theta}\\theta)^2(d(x ) -\\frac{1}{2}\\tilde{\\partial}_\\mu\\tilde{\\partial}^\\mu c(x))\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and perturbed @xmath10 operator = -i _ | -^_. using wess - zumino gauge we obtain a lagrangian @xmath17 where @xmath4 is an auxiliary chiral field and @xmath18 is the twisted field strength , @xmath19 the twisted field strength can be written in terms of the standard sme parameters : @xmath20 , where @xmath21 direct calculation confirms that the action is invariant under the supersymmetry transformations @xmath22 this defines an @xmath13 supersymmetric theory with lorentz violation .",

    "for example , taking the @xmath33 to vanish in the compactified directions leads to a lagrangian of the form = - ^2 + i | l+ _ _ ij^^ij , where the complex scalar fields @xmath43 transform as a 6 of @xmath39 and are given by @xmath44 the associated action is invariant under the supersymmetry transformations @xmath45    similarly , choosing the @xmath46 parameters to vanish in the spacetime directions @xmath47 we obtain a lagrangian of the form = - f^2 + i | l+ _ _ ij^^ij , where @xmath48 with the matrix @xmath49 containing the effect of lorentz violation in the compactified directions .",
    "the associated action is invariant under the supersymmetry transformations    @xmath50    note that if the scalars @xmath51 are identified with physical scalars @xmath43 we restore @xmath39 symmetry and remove any lorentz violating effects .",
    "if , however , the @xmath43 couple to other sectors , lorentz effects may reappear in these sectors .",

    "* the same techniques can be applied to obtain an @xmath52 supersymmetric theory with lorentz violation .",
    "the construction proceeds by working in 4 + 2-dimensional spacetime and using dimensional reduction@xcite .",
    "* because these constructions involve changing the structure of the underlying superalgebra,@xcite the no - go results of nibbelink and pospelov@xcite do not apply ."
