    "time - dependent quantum mechanics is a fundamental topic in physics , chemistry , and engineering .",
    "traditionally , dynamics of a quantum system such as lifetime and energy difference between states can be revealed by spectral lines in the frequency domain by using the fourier analysis .",
    "however , the fourier transform presents limited chronological information of a dynamical system . to explore chronological information in a quantum dynamical system ,",
    "time - frequency ( tf ) methods are necessary .    in recent experiment advances , tf methods such as wavelet transform combined with ultrafast spectroscopy techniques were used to probe dynamics in molecules , solids and liquids @xcite , particular in light harvesting complexes@xcite . in attosecond physics , the short - time fourier transform ( stft ) , the continuous wavelet transform ( cwt ) , wigner - ville distribution ( wvd ) ( which belongs to the cohen class distribution ) , were employed to uncover dynamical mechanisms including high - order harmonic generation ( hhg ) @xcite . lately ,",
    "hilbert transform and the synchrosqueezing transform ( sst ) were applied to investigate multiple scattering @xcite and the dynamic origin of near- and below - threshold harmonic generation , respectively @xcite .",
    "while these studies show the usefulness and potential of each individual tf analysis for probing dynamics of a quantum system , several crucial issues remain when it comes to analysis of a quantum system with unknown complicated dynamics .",
    "first , different types of tf methods and the choice of window functions may provide extremely different tf representation , leading to conflicting physical interpretation .",
    "second , it is difficult to select a particular tf method based on previous studies , in which the physical models are different , _",
    "e.g. _ , 1d @xcite , 2d @xcite and 3d atoms @xcite , and solved by different numerical schemes @xcite .",
    "clearly , tf representations derived from different tf methods based on different physical models can not provide an impartial comparison .",
    "third , in the past decades , several modern tf methods , _",
    "e.g. _ , the cohen class distribution , empirical mode decomposition with hilbert spectrum ( emd - hs ) , reassignment methods ( rm ) , and sst have been proposed and successfully applied to classical macroscopic dynamical systems including molecular dynamics @xcite , cardiopulmonary coupling phenomena @xcite , chronotaxic systems @xcite , lamb wave propagation @xcite and seismic data @xcite .",
    "however , cohen class distribution other than the wvd , emd - hs , rm , and different forms of sst have not been discussed in quantum dynamical systems . as a consequence ,",
    "a comprehensive tf study in the same benchmark is essential .    to this end , we take 3d hydrogen atom as a benchmark because hydrogen is one of the most representative systems in quantum mechanics .",
    "all simulations are based on the same numerical method ( time - dependent generalized pseudospectral method ) , and different contemporary tf analysis , including the stft , cwt , cohen class distributions , rm , ssts and emd - hs , are applied to study the simulated signals .",
    "the systematic comparison of the tf methods enables to interpret physical processes in a quantum system .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section [ section :",
    "theoreticalmodel ] , we summarize the physical model of the hydrogen system in a strong laser field and the numerical simulation . in section [ section :",
    "tfanalysis ] , we provide an overview of the tf methods , as well as a discussion of their pros and cons . in order to show that quantum dynamical phenomena can be depicted by the tf methods , we perform simulations with two different sets of laser parameters , including hydrogen in the regime of multiphoton ionization and tunneling ionization",
    ". the results of tf representations by different tf methods and a discussion of their limitations and potential applications are given in section [ section : resultdiscussion ] . in section [ section : conclusion ] we conclude the paper and provide an empirical procedure to analyze an unknown complicated quantum system .",
    "we simulate hydrogen dynamics in a linear polarized laser field in the framework of the electric dipole approximation and non - relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "note that for the wavelength range of approximately @xmath0 to @xmath1 nm , the electric dipole approximation is valid @xcite only when the laser intensity @xmath2 is smaller than @xmath3 .",
    "the time - dependent schrdinger equation for atomic hydrogen interacting with a linearly polarized field along the @xmath4-axis in atomic units can be expressed as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the wave function at position @xmath7 and at time @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the external laser field . to numerically solve this equation ,",
    "we adopt a time - dependent generalized pseudospectral method @xcite which consists of two essential steps : ( 1 ) the spatial coordinates are optimally discretized in a nonuniform fashion by means of the generalized pseudospectral technique : the grid is denser near the origin and sparser away from the origin ; ( 2 ) a second order split operator technique in the energy representation , which allows the explicit limitation of undesirable fast - oscillating high energy components , is used to obtain an efficient and accurate time propagation of the wave function .",
    "according to previous studies @xcite , dynamical phenomena such as the hhg is associated with the electric dipoles , i.e. , the laser - driven electron oscillating around the stationary nucleus , which could be expressed as , respectively , the time - dependent induced dipole in the length form , denoted as @xmath11 , and in the acceleration form , denoted as @xmath12 @xcite : @xmath13 @xmath14",
    "suppose the signal @xmath15 is composed of finite oscillatory components , that is , @xmath16 , and each component has a time - varying amplitude modulation ( am ) , @xmath17 , and time - varying instantaneous frequency ( if ) @xmath18 , where",
    "@xmath19 stands for the first derivative , then the tf representation reflects the if , which is a generalization of the notation frequency , and the localized phase information could be extracted .",
    "we call @xmath20 an intrinsic mode type ( imt ) function .",
    "more details about this kind of function could be found in appendix a.    to disclose the time - varying nature of this kind of signal , in particular the if and am , the tf analysis is a powerful approach . in the following subsections we provide an overview on classical and contemporary tf methods .",
    "the global analysis nature of the fourier transform is responsible for its limitation in extracting time - varying dynamics inside an oscillatory signal .",
    "an intuitive way to resolve this limitation is analyzing the signal locally ; that is , we could crop a segment of finite length and apply the fourier transform , and expect to observe how a signal oscillates locally .",
    "this idea leads to the stft .",
    "we introduce a window function @xmath21 to crop the signal at different time and perform the fourier analysis .",
    "this analysis results in a time - frequency ( tf ) representation of the signal @xcite : @xmath22 we call @xmath23 a tf representation of the given function @xmath24 and @xmath25 the spectrogram of @xmath24 . here",
    "the stft by eq .",
    "( [ intro.02 ] ) is different from the conventional definition by an additional modulation factor @xmath26 .",
    "nevertheless , temporal and frequency resolutions can not be achieved simultaneously by the stft , according to the heisenberg uncertainty principal @xcite . in other words ,",
    "a wide window provides a good frequency estimation in the stft at the cost of poor temporal resolution , while a narrow window has the opposite trade - off . in this research",
    "we follow the tradition and choose the gaussian function with a standard deviation of @xmath27 ( the full width at half maximum of the gaussian is @xmath28 ) as the window function , i.e. , @xmath29 , which leads to the gabor transform ( gt ) : @xmath30 here the gt we apply here differs from the usual one by an additional modulation factor @xmath31 .",
    "based on the same local analysis idea as that of the stft , we could analyze the momentary behavior of the signal @xmath15 by the cwt : @xmath32 where @xmath21 is the chosen mother wavelet and the scale parameter @xmath33 controls the dilation of the window , and @xmath34 denote the complex conjugate @xcite . due to the dilation nature of the transform , the tf representation analyzed by the cwt",
    "has a good time resolution and poor frequency resolution at the high frequency region and a good frequency resolution and poor time resolution at the low frequency region .",
    "one of the commonly applied mother wavelet is the morlet wavelet , and the cwt based on the morlet wavelet is called the morlet wavelet transform ( mwt ) : @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the morlet wavelet and @xmath38 .",
    "the standard deviation for the dilated morlet wavelet is @xmath39 . in eq .",
    "( [ intro.05 ] ) , we follow the convention and use @xmath40 , which is the inverse of the scale parameter @xmath33 in eq .",
    "( [ intro.04 ] ) .",
    "note the fundamental difference between eq .",
    "( [ intro.05 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ intro.03 ] )  in the gt , the gaussian function is of a fixed width but in the mwt the width varies . in the mwt",
    "the window width @xmath27 varies with @xmath40 such that the quality factor @xmath41 ( the inverse of the relative bandwidth ) is invariant on the tf plane @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the window width @xmath27 becomes smaller as @xmath40 increases , and vice versa . since the frequency resolution depends on the scale , we say that the tf representation by cwt has an _ adaptive frequency resolution_.    both the stft and the cwt belong to the _ linear type tf analysis _ ,",
    "in which the signal is characterized by their inner products with a preassigned family of templates with free parameters . clearly , these tf representations depend on the chosen window , which might cause artificial patterns on the analysis result .",
    "further , while in general the underlying structure of the signal under analysis is not known , there is no systematic way to design the window which faithfully reflects the structure .",
    "the above facts render the linear type tf analysis _",
    "non - adaptive _ to the signal under analysis .      to resolve the non - adaptivity issue of the linear type tf analysis as well as finding the higher order structure ,",
    "the wigner - ville distribution ( wvd ) @xcite was proposed .",
    "the wvd is based on the concept of the autocorrelation function and is defined as @xmath42 note that by a slight change of variable , we could view the wvd as a variant stft which is free of the window choice issue . in this sense , wvd is _ adaptive _ to the signal under analysis . also note that by a direct derivation , the spectrogram could be understood as follows @xcite : @xmath43 the wvd has several good mathematical properties , e.g. , the signal energy is preserved in the wvd , the wvd is a real - valued function on the tf - plane and it provides a precise information about the chirp signal , like @xmath44 , where @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 . however , choosing the signal itself as the window function causes specific artifacts depending on the signal type .",
    "for example ,",
    "when there are more than one oscillatory component in the signal , the interference patterns in the tf representation is inevitable , which might lead to mis - interpretation of the signal .    by construction ,",
    "the wvd is quadratic in the signal which could be viewed as an energy distribution . a direct generalization of the wvd based on imposing some constraints on the _ covariance structure _ @xcite of the signal leads to the cohen s class . in other words ,",
    "the cohen s class , which comprises all bilinear tf representations that are covariant to shifts in both time and frequency @xcite and has the following form : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is an arbitrary parameter function .",
    "different parameter functions lead to different tf representations .",
    "note that the wvd is a member of the cohen s class when @xmath50 .",
    "different parameter functions lead to different tf techniques .",
    "one particular technique is eliminating the interferences in the wvd when there are more than one oscillatory component . to be more specific",
    ", we can employ a separable parameter function @xmath51 in eq .",
    "( [ intro.07 ] ) , where suitably chosen @xmath52 and @xmath53 permit a continuous and independent control of the interferences in time and frequency , respectively .",
    "the corresponding representation is called the _ smoothed pseudo - wigner - ville distribution _ ( spwvd ) @xcite and could be rewritten as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the inverse fourier transform of @xmath52 .",
    "particularly , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are even functions with @xmath56 and @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the fourier transform of @xmath53 .",
    "we mention that we could consider a variation of the cohen s class to get the family of the _ affine class _ @xcite , e.g. , the affine wvd or the affine spwvd . the transform considered in the affine class is the time - scale covariant and the tf representation also has the adaptive resolution feature . to simplify the discussion , we do not study the affine class transforms , but we mention that their performance is similar to those in the cohen s class . the above - mentioned transforms are overall called the _",
    "quadratic tf analysis_. a higher - order generalization is also possible , and we refer the reader of interest to , for example , @xcite .      as features of a tf representation computed by a linear type of tf method are smeared by the introduced window functions and those by the quadratic type ones are obscured by interferences , the rm was proposed to sharpen the resolution of the tf representation .",
    "generally speaking , the coefficients of the tf representation at @xmath59 is reallocated to a different point @xmath60 according to a predefined reallocation rule @xcite .",
    "a common choice of the reallocation rule is to assign values of a tf representation to the local centroids .",
    "note that this is different from the averaging idea behind the stft ( eq .",
    "( [ intro.02q ] ) ) . in this study",
    "we apply the rm to the stft and spwvd , and called the methods rm - stft and rm - spwvd , respectively .    the reallocation rule for the rm - stft",
    "is derived by estimating the local centers of gravity , denoted as : @xmath61 @xmath62    the notations @xmath63 and @xmath64 stand for the window function @xmath65 and the first derivative of @xmath66 in the stft , respectively .",
    "the rm - stft is thus defined as @xmath67 essentially , this formula reassign the energetic contents of the spectrogram to the new location @xmath68 . as a consequence",
    ", the rm leads to a substantially improved resolution in the tf representation .",
    "note that the reassignment rules eq .",
    "( [ reassign.02b ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ reassign.03b ] ) can lead to the group delay and the if of the bandpass filtered signal @xmath69 @xcite , using only the unwrapped phase of the @xmath70 .",
    "however these physical meaningful expressions are numerically inefficient",
    ". other forms of reassignment operators can be found in @xcite .",
    "next we consider spwvd .",
    "although the spwvd can smooth out the interferences in the wvd , the smoothing functions introduce artificial broadening . applying",
    "the reassignment technique on the tf representation of the spwvd can reduce such artifacts .",
    "similar to eq .",
    "( [ reassign.04 ] ) , the reassigned representation of the spwvd is @xmath71 where the reassignment rule @xmath72 is determined by the concept of expectation : @xmath73 despite rms are intuitive techniques to sharpen the linear type and quadratic type tf representations , inverse routines as well as mode reconstruction are not available .      in this section",
    "we describe the sst , which is a special rm aiming to address the intrinsic blurring issue in the linear tf methods . to be more precise , the sst manifests if characteristic according to the reallocation rule that consists of solely the frequency information , rather than the centroid of the tf representation @xcite .",
    "in addition to sharpening the tf representation , the causality property of the signal is preserved in the sst , which allows the decomposition of oscillatory components when the signal is composed of several oscillatory components .",
    "we refer the reader who has interest in the theoretical analysis and other details , like reconstructing each oscillatory component and robust to noise , of sst to @xcite . in this section",
    "we describe the synchrosqueezed stft ( sst - stft ) and the synchrosqueezed cwt ( sst - cwt ) .",
    "consider a @xmath23 of @xmath15 with a window function @xmath66 such that @xmath74 $ ] , where @xmath75 is the fourier transform of @xmath21 and @xmath76 is the smallest gap of ifs of any two consecutive oscillatory components .",
    "the sst - stft is given as @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the reallocation rule and @xmath79 is a controllable smoothing parameter for the resolution , which in practice is chosen to be small .",
    "the reallocation rule given by the following equation utilizes the phase information hidden inside the smeared tf representation : @xmath80 note that only the frequency reassignment operator is considered in the sst - stft , so that the causality property of the signal can be preserved . a slight modification of @xmath81 based on the second - order information of the if @xcite might further improve the tf representation . indeed , when the interested oscillatory component could be approximated by a chirp function @xcite , although the tf representation is sharpened by the sst - stft , a mild spreading is inevitable .",
    "we call this mild spreading the _ diffusive pattern_. to cope with the diffusive pattern , we could consider the following reassignment rule : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is defined as @xmath84 the reconstruction formulas @xcite for each imt function @xmath85 from @xmath86 is @xmath87 where @xmath88 , @xmath89 denotes taking the real part , and @xmath90 .",
    "the definition of the sst - cwt is similar to that of the sst - stft . for a cwt with a mother wavelet @xmath21 such that",
    "@xmath91 $ ] , with @xmath92 , the sst - cwt is given by @xmath93 where @xmath79 is a smoothing parameter and @xmath78 is the reallocation rule defined by @xmath94    when describing an oscillatory component with a fast varying if , the tf representation in sst - cwt may show a slight spreading . while the second - order information of the if has been discussed in the sst - stft@xcite , it is not yet been studied .",
    "the reconstruction formula @xcite for each imt function @xmath85 under sst - cwt is @xmath95 where @xmath88 , and @xmath96 .",
    "the results of the sst are `` adaptive '' to the signal in the sense that the error in the estimation depends only on the first three moments of the mother wavelet instead of the profile of the mother wavelet @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the influence of the chosen window on the associated tf representation is minimized compared with the linear tf methods .",
    "in addition to the above properties , the sst is robust to several different kinds of noise , which might be slightly non - stationary @xcite . an important property shared by the sst - stft , sst - cwt and rm - stft is that by taking a short window , the fast varying if could be well captured .    at the first glance ,",
    "the results of the reassignment technique and sst seem to break the well - known heisenberg uncertain principle , which says that the temporal and frequency resolution can not be achieved simultaneously .",
    "however , in the reassignment technique and sst , we have shown that we could obtain a tf representation with an almost perfect time and frequency resolution .",
    "the main reason is that we focus on the oscillatory signals , in particular the adaptive harmonic model but not the whole @xmath97 space .",
    "we mention that the behavior of the rm and sst on the general @xmath97 function is an open question .",
    "one popular way to define the if of a given signal @xmath15 is via finding the analytic representation of @xmath15 with the aid of the hilbert transform : @xmath98 where @xmath99 denotes the hilbert transform of @xmath15 . in this equation ,",
    "@xmath100 and @xmath101 are the modulus and phase of @xmath102 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the if of @xmath15 is thus defined as the rate of the varying phase : @xmath103 however , the if provided by eq .",
    "( [ emd.02 ] ) is not always meaningful . to deal with this problem ,",
    "the empirical mode decomposition algorithm ( emd ) @xcite was proposed to decompose @xmath15 into a series of functions called the intrinsic mode function ( imf ) , @xmath104 , on which the hilbert transform can be applied subsequently , via an algorithm called the sifting process .",
    "imfs must satisfy the following two conditions : ( i ) in the whole data set of a signal , the number of extrema and the number of zero crossings must either be equal or differ at most by one ; ( narrow band ) ( ii ) at any point , the mean value of the envelope defined by the local maxima and the envelope defined by the local minima is zero ( adoption of local properties ) . note that in general an imf is different from an imt function .",
    "details of the emd algorithm could be found in , for example , @xcite .    for each imf @xmath85 , the corresponding if and am amplitudes can be estimated by eq .",
    "( [ emd.01 ] ) via the hilbert transform and eq .",
    "( [ emd.02 ] ) . by assigning the if and",
    "amplitudes of all imfs on a tf plane , we obtain the hilbert spectrum ( hs ) @xmath105 ( hs ) , which is a tf representation for @xmath15 determined by @xmath106 where @xmath107 denotes the dirac delta measure .",
    "although the emd along with hs has been applied to several fields , due to a number of heuristic and _ ad hoc _ elements in the emd algorithm , it is difficult to analyze its accuracy and limitation .",
    "in addition , despite the solid mathematical support , the hilbert transform might be limited when applied to analyze the momentary dynamics of an oscillatory signal .",
    "first , due to the slow decay nature of the kernel in the hilbert transform , keeping the causality of the signal structure might be difficult .",
    "second , when the signal has time - varying amplitude and frequency , in general there is no guarantee to get the correct analytic signal from a given real oscillatory signal by the hilbert transform in eq .",
    "( [ emd.01 ] ) .",
    "we mention that the part of using the hilbert transform to obtain the am and if of each imf could be replaced by using the sst - stft or sst - cwt . in this case , the method is regarded as the emd - sst - stft and emd - sst - cwt .",

    "linear tf methods with an appropriate window function , can vaguely depict discrete odd harmonics in the hhg process , yet the detail features such as the ac stark effect can not be revealed .",
    "in addition , in the tunneling ionization regime , the first - return trajectories are roughly illustrated , but the multiple returns are indistinct because of the broadening induced by the window . while present little broadening , tf representations by the wvd suffer from artificial interference patterns and lead to incorrect interpretation of physical mechanisms , such as even harmonics in the multiphoton ionization regime and false trajectories in the tunneling ionization regime . to eliminate the artifacts mentioned above ,",
