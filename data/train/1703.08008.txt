    "however , the number  @xcite , locations , and even existence itself are still controversial .",
    "the experimental search for the critical point is one of the fundamental purposes of the relativistic heavy ion collision experiments  @xcite .",
    "because the medium created by these experiments pursues different trajectories in the @xmath0@xmath1 plane depending on collision energies @xmath2 , this search would be achieved by comparing the characteristics of collision events at various @xmath2 . for this purpose , active experimental studies in the beam - energy scan ( bes ) program at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) are ongoing  @xcite .",
    "future heavy - ion program at j - parc  @xcite , fair  @xcite and nica  @xcite will also contribute to this subject .    in the experimental search for the qcd critical point , fluctuation observables , such as the cumulants of the net - baryon number ,",
    "are believed to be natural and promising observables  @xcite . at the critical point in the thermodynamic limit ,",
    "equilibrated fluctuations of various observables diverge reflecting the softening of the effective potential .",
    "such singular behavior is expected to be found in event - by - event analyses in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the experimental analyses of the fluctuation observables , especially focusing on non - gaussianity , have been performed actively recently  @xcite .",
    "in interpreting the experimentally - observed fluctuations , however , it should be remembered that the fluctuations observed in these experiments are not those in an equilibrated medium near the critical point .",
    "first , the more closely the system approaches the critical point , the longer becomes the relaxation time toward equilibrium because of the critical slowing down  @xcite .",
    "owing to this effect , the enhancement of fluctuations is limited even if the medium passes right through the qcd critical point .",
    "second , the critical fluctuations are to be distorted during the subsequent evolution until the detection  @xcite",
    ". remember that particles are measured only in the final state . to extract the information on the critical point from the experimental data , proper understanding and description of these effects are indispensable , in addition to various restrictions from the real experimental settings  @xcite .",
    "the time evolution of critical fluctuations has been discussed in the literature  @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the effect of the critical slowing down is discussed for fluctuation of a uniform order parameter field @xmath3 .",
    "it is known , however , that the critical mode of the qcd critical point is not the pure @xmath4 mode , but rather is given by a linear mixing of the @xmath4 mode and conserved charges @xcite .",
    "the soft mode of the critical point thus is a diffusion mode . as we will see below",
    ", the time evolution of a diffusion mode depends on the length scale , and this property is crucial for the description of its dynamics .",
    "one of the main goals of the present study is to reveal the dynamical evolution of the critical fluctuation with the diffusion property .",

    "in order to understand the evolution of the conserved - charge fluctuations , we first need to know that of the charge density itself in a collision event . this problem has been discussed for a hadronic medium in a simple setup @xcite , but to the best of our knowledge it has not yet been studied for the case where a critical enhancement is encountered during the evolution . carrying out this subject is the second goal of this study .    in this study , in order to address these issues we employ a simple stochastic diffusion equation ( sde ) . in this approach ,",
    "the singularity associated with the critical point is encoded in the time - dependent susceptibility and diffusion coefficient .",

    "moreover , as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , the critical mode at the qcd critical point has the diffusion character and should be described by the sde .    in this study , we first write down a formal solution for the density fluctuation within rapidity window @xmath5 . next , with a phenomenological parametrization for the susceptibility and diffusion coefficient ,",
    "we analyze numerically the time evolution of the fluctuation .",
    "we find that the time evolution of the fluctuations strongly depends on the size of the rapidity window @xmath5 .",
    "we also show that the second - order cumulant can have a non - monotonic @xmath5 dependence only when the medium fluctuation undergoes a critical enhancement during the time evolution .",
    "it is argued that this non - monotonic behavior serves as a robust experimental signal of the critical enhancement .    in the present study",
    "we restrict our attention only to the second - order cumulant , and leave the analysis of third and still higher order cumulants for future study , because even at the second order non - trivial outcomes are obtained from the analysis .",
    "we also deal with the correlation functions of conserved charges .",
    "we show that the same argument on the non - monotonic behavior holds for this function with rapidity window replaced by rapidity separation .",
    "the relation between the cumulant and the correlation function is also studied in detail .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce the sde , and argue that this model is suitable for describing the dynamics of conserved - charge fluctuations including the critical ones .",

    "the sde  ( [ eq : sde ] ) is not only a suitable equation for describing the time evolution of conserved charges in a non - critical system , but also a good phenomenological equation to deal with the slow dynamics near the qcd critical point .",

    "this behavior makes the non - monotonic peaks in @xmath169 and @xmath170 more prominent .",

    "this argument suggests that the non - monotonic signals can be observed even when the trajectory does not pass right through the critical point .",
    "moreover , it is possible that the trajectory off the critical point is more favorable for the emergence of the non - monotonicity .",
    "however , the signal of the critical enhancement , of course , weakens and finally disappears as the trajectory departs further off the critical point .",
    "in our analysis with @xmath163 , the non - monotonic behavior of @xmath169 and @xmath170 disappears at @xmath188 and @xmath189 , respectively .",
    "the most important conclusion of the present study is eqs .",
    "( [ eq : nonmono - cum ] ) and ( [ eq : nonmono - cor ] ) , i.e. the non - monotonic behaviors of @xmath169 and/or @xmath170 , if observed , are direct experimental signals of the critical enhancement in the susceptibility .",
    "now , let us consider the application of this conclusion to real heavy ion collisions . throughout this study we assumed the bjorken space - time evolution .",

    "it is expected , however , that these effects do not alter our conclusions on non - monotonicity as long as the system size in rapidity space is sufficiently large compared to the diffusion length .",
    "first , the violation of the bjorken picture makes the correspondence between the coordinate and momentum space rapidities worse .",
    "this makes the thermal blurring effect stronger @xcite , and the experimental measurement of non - monotonicity would become difficult . even in this case , however , the relations eqs .",
    "( [ eq : nonmono - cum ] ) and ( [ eq : nonmono - cor ] ) should hold , because the thermal blurring effect only acts to enhance the diffusion length @xcite . from the analysis in ref .",

    "we adopted the stochastic diffusion equation with critical nature being encoded in the time - dependent susceptibility and diffusion coefficient .",

    "<S> we study time evolution of critical fluctuations of conserved charges near the qcd critical point in the context of relativistic heavy ion collisions . a stochastic diffusion equation is employed in order to describe the diffusion property of the critical fluctuation arising from the coupling of the order parameter field to conserved charges . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the diffusion property gives rise to a possibility of probing the early time fluctuations through the rapidity window dependence of the second - order cumulant and correlation function of conserved charges . </S>",
    "<S> it is pointed out that their non - monotonic behaviors as functions of the rapidity interval are robust experimental signals for the existence of the critical enhancement around the qcd critical point . </S>"
