    "the ongoing debate whether the devices d - wave one and d - wave two , which contain hundreds of superconducting flux qubits , demonstrate quantum or classical annealing @xcite , is to a large extent due to the fact that their quantitative simulation is at the moment impossible . characteristically , there was no controversy over quantum behaviour of an 8-qubit register @xcite , where a quantitative agreement was found between the experimental data and the theoretical predictions . though one can not expect to be able to model classically a large enough quantum system @xcite ,",
    "the development of efficient classical algorithms could hopefully enable us to model quantum systems just big enough to take over .",
    "we can also exploit the idiosyncratic features of certain quantum devices , which simplify their modelling by classical means . here",
    "we demonstrate such an algorithm for modelling linear adiabatic evolution , including the case when decoherence is present .",
    "this result depends on the analyticity of the final state of the system as a function of evolution time , which is rigorously proven .",
    "our small - scale numerical realizations of this algorithm show that some features of quantum annealing are comparable to the behaviour of d - wave machines . since at this stage the simulations do not account for the specific physical conditions that influence the machine s performance we stop short of drawing conclusions as to the strength of signatures of quantumness in the actual device .",
    "nevertheless , we do hope that the tools developed here will enable a better understanding of this important problem .",
    "an adiabatic process evolves the state vector of a quantum annealer over time @xmath0 along the trajectory @xmath1 , where the parameter @xmath2 $ ] is the reduced time @xmath3 .",
    "the initial value @xmath4 is the ground state of the initial hamiltonian @xmath5 .",
    "when the process stops at @xmath6 the state @xmath7 is considered as an approximant to the ground state of the custom design hamiltonian @xmath8 , which encodes the solution of an optimization problem of choice .",
    "we consider the standard linear case , when the evolution is driven by the time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath9 according to the schrdinger equation @xmath10    let the quantum system be an @xmath11-qubit register . in order to fix notation we describe the eigenstates and the corresponding eigenvalues of @xmath12 : @xmath13 however , this assumption is not necessary to derive the analytic results presented in next section .",
    "as we will see , our analysis remains valid in every case of bounded ( in particular , finite ) hamiltonians @xmath14 .",
    "the purpose of analysis and simulation of ( [ ham_of_s ] ) is estimation of the success probability @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the projector onto the ground state space of @xmath8 , e.g. for a non - degenerate ground state @xmath17 .",
    "( in fact , in most cases of interest to us the dimension of the ground state space @xmath18 exceeds @xmath19 .",
    "this is rigorously accounted for in all numerical results presented in this article . )",
    "@xmath20 provides a measure of the accuracy with which the adiabatic process finds the solution of the underlying problem . for the hamiltonians considered here ,",
    "the instantaneous ground state @xmath21 is non - degenerate for @xmath22 ( see remarks ) , although the ground state of @xmath8 may be highly degenerate . in a practical optimisation problem",
    "any of these degenerate states would be an equally useful solution . while there is a unique vector in the ground state space adiabatically connected to the initial ground state , this will in general be a superposition of computational basis states ( a random one of which will be seen in the readout ) and not necessarily of interest in the context of optimisation .",
    "having fixed @xmath0 and the number of steps and the hamiltonian , we repeatedly conduct the numerical experiment .",
    "final hamiltonians are drawn from an ensemble of binary optimization problems and the simulation outputs the probability of success @xmath20 for each instance of @xmath23 .",
    "we record the outcome of the series of experiments in a histogram of @xmath20 values .",
    "the histogram of the probability of success has long been adopted as a means for testing hypotheses about adiabatic computing , see e.g. @xcite and , more recently , @xcite .",
    "* remarks . *",
    "it is interesting to briefly consider the evolution of the ground state projector @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is as above . given that in the case at hand the dependence of @xmath12 on @xmath26 is linear and _ a fortiori _ holomorphic , the theory of analytic perturbations applies and it gives us the following picture : a standard general result , see theorem 1.8 , p. 70",
    ", @xcite , tells us that all the eigenvalues @xmath27 as well as the corresponding eigenprojections , including @xmath28 , will depend on s analytically in the entire complex plane . _",
    "a priori _ these analytic functions may have algebraic type singularities at a set of isolated exceptional points in the complex plane , where the number of distinct eigenvalues is lower than in the generic case .",
    "more precisely , the eigenvalues as functions of @xmath26 are holomorphic in simply - connected domains that exclude the exceptional points . at the exceptional points",
    "an eigenvalue function may have , although does not necessarily have to have , a branching point .",
    "moreover , at a branching point the corresponding eigenprojection will have a pole . _ a priori _ ,",
    "such a scenario , i.e. hitting a branching point where the eigenprojection has a singularity , might be construed as a `` phase transition '' of the first kind . from this point of view",
    "it is not clear _ a priori _ why a result such as theorem [ radius_infty ] should hold .",
    "( note that the result can be reformulated for complex variable @xmath26 stating that the solution of ( [ schr_of_s ] ) is an entire function of @xmath26 . )",
    "if we restrict the variable @xmath26 to the real line , the picture outlined above is considerably simplified . indeed ,",
    "in this case @xmath12 is a self - adjoint operator , and satisfies the assumptions of theorem 6.1 , p. 120",
    "this result assures us that both the eigenvalues and the eigenprojections are holomorphic around every point of the real line .",
    "in other words , even if some @xmath29 on the real line is an exceptional point , the projection will not have a pole there and none of the eigenvalue functions will branch .",
    "however , we emphasize that the dimension of the ground state may jump discontinuously at the exceptional point , e.g. consider @xmath30 with the corresponding projection @xmath28 and @xmath31 with @xmath32",
    ". it may be that @xmath33 .",
    "both these projections depend on @xmath26 holomorphically but the projection onto the ground state of @xmath34 will be @xmath35 . this explains why the projections corresponding to the eigenvalues depend on @xmath26 continuously , while the projection to the ground state may have isolated jump discontinuities . in particular ,",
    "the latter scenario is bound to play out for at least one point @xmath36 $ ] when the ground state spaces of @xmath5 and @xmath8 have different dimensions . at this juncture",
    "it is interesting to invoke a recent result of zhang et al . , @xcite , which shows that in the particular case of hamiltonians we work with in our numerical simulations , see ( [ hi])([hf ] ) , the ground state is non - degenerate for all @xmath37 .",
    "this implies that in all cases for which the ground state of @xmath8 is degenerate the minimal gap tends to zero as @xmath26 approaches @xmath19 from the left .",
    "since hamiltonian ( [ ham_of_s ] ) depends on parameter @xmath26 linearly , the solution of eq .",
    "( [ schr_of_s ] ) may be expected to depend on @xmath26 analytically , at least for small @xmath26 .",
    "thus , we look for solutions in the form of a taylor series @xmath38 in fact , we will demonstrate that the radius of convergence of series characterizing solutions of eq .",
    "( [ schr_of_s ] ) is infinite , i.e. the series converge for all @xmath26 , see theorem [ radius_infty ] below . in order to simplify notation ,",
    "let us define auxiliary operators @xmath39 thus , ( [ schr_of_s ] ) is equivalent to @xmath40 below we will consider this equation for general bounded operators @xmath41 and @xmath42 , and only later draw conclusions about the specific case ( [ auxil ] ) relevant to the application at hand .    substituting ( [ ansatz ] ) in ( [ schr_ab ] ) we readily obtain @xmath43 we use this recurrence as the core of numerical schemas for simulation of the solutions of ( [ ham_of_s ] ) .",
    "it allows relatively efficient , as compared to ode simulation , computation of consecutive terms and consecutive partial sums of the series ( [ ansatz ] ) .",
    "numerical experiment shows that this method , implemented directly as a matlab script , is typically faster than the standard ode solver ` ode45 ' by a factor exceeding 3 for @xmath44 qubits . for @xmath45 ,",
    "in which case the memory constraint plays a significant role , the speed up factor is approximately 60 , reducing the computation time from just under one hour to under one minute .",
    "moreover , as described in section v , a careful implementation of an optimized code allowed us to simulate systems with up to @xmath46 .",
    "a similar procedure can be applied if the interpolation is a polynomial of order @xmath47 in @xmath26 : in that case the three - term recurrence relation will be replaced by an @xmath48-order recurrence . indeed",
    ", this may also be possible for an analytic interpolating function of known taylor series .",
    "however , to demonstrate the method we only discuss the simplest ( linear ) interpolation here .",
    "note that evaluation of the success probability ( [ success ] ) requires only the computation of @xmath49 in other words , the solution is found , immediately as it were , at the point @xmath50 without the need of finding all the intermediate states @xmath51 .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the computation based on an application of an ode solver to eq .",
    "( [ schr_of_s ] ) .",
    "the current method has been tested against our earlier study of the correlation between gap and success probability@xcite ; in that work we used a conventional ( dormand - prince ) solver .",
    "note also that if series ( [ ansatz ] ) is known to converge absolutely , then @xmath51 automatically satisfies ( [ schr_of_s ] ) .",
    "therefore , the main issue at stake is the estimation of the radius of convergence @xmath52 here @xmath53 denotes the @xmath54 norm . in general",
    "@xmath55 depends on the constituents of the process @xmath14 and possibly even @xmath4 . from the point of view of simulations",
    "it is ideal to have @xmath56 , which ensures that @xmath51 given in ( [ ansatz ] ) is the solution of ( [ schr_of_s ] ) for all ( reduced ) times @xmath57 .",
    "if on the other hand , @xmath58 , then the series can not be used to estimate the success probability .",
    "but , as we shall see , the series ( [ ansatz ] ) converges everywhere .",
    "let us introduce the following notation : @xmath59 here , @xmath53 is the operator norm . throughout the article",
    "we assume @xmath60 .",
    "for the particular case of ( [ auxil ] ) , we have @xmath61 . the hamiltonians are nontrivial and bounded , e.g. finite dimensional , and , moreover , @xmath62 .",
    "we have the following result :    [ radius_infty ] @xmath56 , i.e. series ( [ ansatz ] ) converges absolutely in the entire complex plane and its limit @xmath63 for @xmath64 is the solution of ( [ schr_ab ] ) satisfying the initial condition @xmath65 .",
    "recurrence ( [ recurrence ] ) readily implies @xmath66 are operators defined via recurrence @xmath67 note that we have @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",
    "we wish to estimate the rate of growth of @xmath71 . to this end",
    "let us consider an auxiliary scalar sequence @xmath72 defined via recurrence @xmath73 since @xmath74 and @xmath75 grows at least as fast as @xmath71 , we clearly have @xmath76 next , we undertake to estimate the growth rate of @xmath72 .",
    "first , observe that @xmath77 may be viewed as a polynomial in two variables , e.g. @xmath78 , @xmath79 , etc .",
    "it is easily seen that the general form of the polynomials is @xmath80a^n + c_1[n ] a^{n-2}b + c_2[n ] a^{n-4}b^2 +   c_3[n ] a^{n-6}b^3 + \\ldots   = \\sum\\limits_{k=0}^{[\\frac{n}{2}]}c_k[n]\\ , a^{n-2k}b^k,\\ ] ] where the coefficients @xmath81 $ ] remain to be found .",

    "moreover , it is easily seen that ( [ recurrence_p ] ) implies @xmath87 & = & 1   \\\\ & & \\\\",
    "c_1[n ]   & = & \\binom{n}{2 } \\\\ \\vdots & & \\\\",
    "c_k[n ] & = & c_k[n-1 ] + ( n-1 ) c_{k-1}[n-2 ] \\end{array}\\ ] ] using this , and applying induction , one readily obtains an explicit formula @xmath88 = ( 2k-1 ) ! !",

    "follows trivially .",
    "next , we obtain from ( [ term_t ] ) and ( [ inequality ] ) : @xmath94}\\frac{1}{k!(n-2k ) ! } a^{n-2k}\\frac{b^k}{2^k } \\\\",

    "indeed in such a case @xmath100 if in addition @xmath101 , then terms @xmath102 diminish very fast which ensures fast convergence of series ( [ ansatz ] ) when @xmath50 , also in the numerical sense .",
    "however , this is not of interest in the current problem as it represents the anti - adiabatic limit , as the number of spin flips during the evolution is of order @xmath103 . in the special case of interest @xmath104 and",
    "the condition @xmath105 is equivalent to @xmath106 this assumption on @xmath0 ensures the most efficient computation of series ( [ ansatz ] ) .",
    "however , we do not claim that this restriction delineates the only regimes in which computation is effective .",
    "now we will extend the above results to the evolution described by the master equation ( see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath107 + l\\rho l^{\\dag } - \\frac{1}{2 } l^{\\dag}l\\rho - \\frac{1}{2 } \\rho l^{\\dag}l .\\ ] ] here , @xmath108 is the density matrix , @xmath109 is the quantum system hamiltonian and the lindblad operator @xmath110 accounts for decoherence due to the uncontrollable interaction of the quantum system with the environment . in some applications",
    "the master equation involves a finite number of different lindblad operators . while for our purposes it is sufficient to have just one lindblad , the results presented here can easily be extended to the more general case .",
    "from now on we will only consider the evolution of finite - dimensional systems .",
    "furthermore , as before we assume that @xmath109 takes the special form ( [ ham_of_s ] ) with @xmath57 .",
    "substituting variables ( [ auxil ] ) as before , we obtain an equivalent form of the master equation @xmath111 + s \\mathcal{l}_b [ \\rho]\\ ] ] with the shorthand notation @xmath112 : = [ a , \\rho ] + t\\left(l\\rho l^{\\dag } - \\frac{1}{2 } l^{\\dag}l\\rho - \\frac{1}{2 } \\rho l^{\\dag}l \\right ) , \\quad \\mbox { and } \\quad    \\mathcal{l}_b [ \\rho ] : = [ b , \\rho].\\ ] ] note that the evolution equation ( [ lind ] ) generalizes the von neumann equation @xmath113.\\ ] ] in the context of adiabatic computing , it is vital to realize that there is an essential difference between the two types of evolution .",
    "namely , at least if certain general conditions on @xmath8 are satisfied , the adiabatic theorem applies to the case ( [ schr_rho ] ) and ensures that the probability of success increases with increasing @xmath0 and will tend to one as @xmath0 tends to infinity .",
    "in contrast , there is no known generalization of the adiabatic theorem , extending it to the case of ( [ lind ] ) .",
    "in fact , in the course of numerical experimentations we have observed that for a relatively large @xmath110 the probability of success may decrease with increasing time @xmath0 .",
    "figure 3 illustrates this phenomenon .",
    "this observation agrees with the conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite that there is a finite time window for the operation of a quantum annealer interacting with the thermal bath .    in order to describe the analytic properties of ( [ lind ] ) we introduce the hilbert space structure on the linear space of @xmath114 matrices ( e.g. @xmath115 for an @xmath11 qubit system ) .",
    "for @xmath116 we define the hilbert - schmidt norm @xmath117 . this norm endows @xmath118 with the hilbert space structure .",
    "we denote the corresponding operator norms of @xmath119 simply by @xmath120 .",
    "as is well known , the hilbert - schmidt norm has the submultiplicative property @xmath121 which , when applied to ( [ def_la ] ) , yields the following estimates : @xmath122    next , we wish to consider solutions of ( [ lind ] ) . to this end",
    "we introduce the taylor series ansatz @xmath123 as before , we substitute ( [ ansatz_rho ] ) into ( [ lind ] ) . in this way",
    "we obtain the following description of the taylor series coefficients : @xmath124 where @xmath125 is a polynomial in variables @xmath126 and @xmath127 defined by recursion : @xmath128 we observe that the proof of theorem [ radius_infty ] can be repeated almost verbatim with obvious modifications such as : replacing @xmath41 with @xmath126 , @xmath42 with @xmath127 , and @xmath129 with @xmath130 , and redefining @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "this yields the following result :    [ radius_infty_rho ] series ( [ ansatz_rho ] ) with coefficients defined via ( [ rho_n ] ) and ( [ recurrence_q ] ) converges absolutely in the entire complex plane . moreover , its limit @xmath133 for @xmath64 is the solution of ( [ lind ] ) satisfying the initial condition @xmath134 .",

    "first , in order to estimate the efficiency of a recurrence one needs to establish a stopping condition .",
    "it is desirable to stop recurrence when the approximation error is sufficiently small .",
    "however , little is known a priori about the solution that is sought in ( [ recurrence ] ) and so the calculus methods do not seem to provide an easy estimate for the dependence of error on the degree of approximation @xmath83 . as a substitute we propose the following stopping condition : @xmath145 here , @xmath146 is regarded as a preset measure of accuracy . in light of the proof of theorem [ radius_infty ] we know that @xmath83 defined by ( [ stopping ] ) is bound to be finite .",
    "moreover , since the solution @xmath147 is an analytic function in the complex plane this is expected to provide a good estimate of the remainder error when @xmath26 is bounded , e.g. @xmath148 .",

    "finally , it is easily seen that the number of arithmetical operations necessary to find @xmath83 taylor coefficients is of rank @xmath170 .",
    "thus , the overall number of arithmetical operations required to carry out the computation is of rank @xmath171 .",
    "this is a polynomial time algorithm when measured against the classical problem size @xmath172 . naturally , and not very surprisingly , it is exponential in the number of qubits .",

    "for the sake of an example let us attempt to compute @xmath178 for @xmath179 .",

    "this is due to rounding error in the large intermediate terms .",
    "indeed , all computations are done in floating point arithmetic with precision in the order of @xmath185 .",
    "this means that the difference between any two consecutive real numbers in the order of @xmath186 is as large as @xmath187 , which seriously impedes computational precision .",
    "in such a case a split of the interval into two parts , @xmath188 and @xmath189 , results in smaller intermediate values and ensures convergence to the correct limit . this may be verified by a nearly exact calculation obtained via an application of , say , @xmath190 , instalments , see fig .",
    "the figure also shows the expected nonmonotonic convergence to unity with increasing @xmath0 , with oscillations determined by the time - averaged larmor frequency .  in addition , we note that a symbolic implementation of our method may be used to reproduce the taylor series of the special function solution",
    ". however , numerical evaluation of special functions is frequently quite problematic , and so the calculation via instalments offers a more practicable approach even if the special function solutions were known in closed - form .    finally , we have used this specific example to benchmark the accuracy of our numerical method ( termed tpt for target - point - taylor ) by comparing it with the standard fourth - order runge - kutta method ( rk or ` ode45 ' ) , @xcite . based on a simple test",

    "we were forced to use a very fine time - discretization @xmath198 as larger time - steps lead to greater error .",
    "this example suggests that for comparable accuracy the ratio of the number of steps required by rk to those required by tpt exceeds @xmath199 . as mentioned above , the ode - solver based methods are impracticable for larger systems due to long computation time .",
    "* remark 3 .",

    "however , for a small fraction of a percentage of ising hamiltonians there is no convergence under these conditions .",
    "nevertheless , in the type of experiment considered in this article those cases are statistically insignificant and may be discarded .    * remark 4 .",

    "it is done independently for every run of the experiments discussed below .",
    "note that @xmath212 and @xmath213 .",
    "following the discussion on section iv , we divide the s - interval in @xmath168 subintervals . even though convergence in each subinterval is faster , the computational time is generally increased by a constant factor not exceeding the number of stages .",
    "the numerical simulations were implemented using compiled matlab code .",
    "the running time was lessened by using sparse matrices and refactoring the formulas ( [ auxil ] ) and ( [ recurrence ] ) to reduce the number of matrix - vector calculations in favour of vector - vector calculations .",
    "the construction of @xmath5 and @xmath8 was made much more efficient by exploiting the structure and symmetries of the matrices .",
    "memory requirements were also lessened by taking advantage of the sparseness and symmetry in the matrix computations . as a result , @xmath11 up to @xmath214 becomes computable on a modest distributed - computing server .",
    "appendix ii provides the source code of our current matlab implementation of the algorithm .",
    "the ` main ` function executes the simulation the indicated number of times , using a sparse matrix ` h_i ` ( the heisenberg matrix representation of the initial hamiltonian ) and a different sparse vector ` h_f ` ( the diagonal of the random ising hamiltonian in the heisenberg matrix representation ) at each time .",
    "functions ` initial_hamiltonian ` and ` random_ising ` create those sparse structures using fractal - like iterations .",
    "finally , function ` taylor_installments ` calculates the taylor series .",
    "the histograms presented in appendix i were produced using up to @xmath215 cores of 2.0ghz intel e5 - 2640l xeon processors distributed on the compute cluster plato of the university of saskatchewan . to illustrate the performance of the implemented algorithm , a total of @xmath216 individual simulations were ran for @xmath217 in about 14 hours , and using less than 5 gb of memory per simulation .",
    "figures 9 and 10 below illustrate the evolution of the compute time per simulation as a function of the number of qubits .",
    "an exponential increase of the compute time for large numbers of qubits can be observed .",
    "we expect this to be the case for any number of qubits and , in consequence , compute times for simulations of larger systems can be estimated .",
    "the fact that this exponential tendency is not verified when the number of qubits is too small , is certainly due to the fact that matlab , and the server itself , requires some time for internal processes ( other than the execution of the algorithm ) .",
    "it appears that this time is much larger than the execution time of the algorithm for these cases when the number of qubits is too small .",
    "the crucial limiting factor in simulation of larger systems is memory capacity .",
    "however , early stage evidence shows that further algorithm optimizations , specialized to 3 tb ram server architectures , enables simulations of size up to 36 qubits .",
    "a detailed account of this ongoing work goes outside the scope of this article and will be reported elsewhere .",
    "we use a schema based on recurrence ( [ recurrence ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we set @xmath218 to be the ground state of @xmath5 .",
    "we note that @xmath23 is exponentially degenerate : the hilbert space is @xmath219-dimensional but there are only @xmath220 distinct eigenvalues , which are separated by multiples of @xmath208 .",
    "in particular , the hamiltonian @xmath12 is invariant under a global spin flip for all time , so adiabatic evolution occurs in the subspace spanned by equal superpositions of computational states and the corresponding spin - flipped states , @xmath221 .",
    "let @xmath16 denote the projector onto the ground state space of @xmath8 .",
    "( note that @xmath16 is computed numerically , which presents no difficulties . )",
    "the probability of success is defined as @xmath222 .",
    "the results from simulation are presented via probability of success histograms , fig . 1 , and figs . 48 . of note",
    "is the ragged landscape feature of the histograms .",
    "this can be understood qualitatively in the following way .",
    "the success probability is largely determined by the low - lying eigenvalue structure .",
    "the aforementioned degeneracy reduces the number of qualitatively different classes and we conjecture that the peaks correspond to different classes .",
    "we conjecture a connection between the low - p tail of the distribution of probability of success and the existence of optimization problems that are inherently hard .",
    "since the optimization problem at hand is known to be np hard , @xcite , we expect this phenomenon to persist for larger systems .      in this setting the probability of success is defined as @xmath223 where , again , @xmath16 is the projector onto the ground state space of @xmath8 . in order to compute @xmath224",
    "we use a schema based on recurrence ( in notation of subsection [ master_subsection ] ) : @xmath225 for the particular experiments presented in figure 2 we took @xmath226 where @xmath227 is the operator , which in the eigenbasis of @xmath8 assumes the off - diagonal form @xmath228\\ ] ] the basis states are in order of increasing energy , with basis states in the degenerate subspaces listed in a particular order .",
    "the effect of this @xmath23-dependent lindblad operator , in isolation , would be to relax the system to the selected ground state , thereby breaking the degeneracy .",
    "however , since it has a highly non - local action on the qubits , its interaction with @xmath12 disturbs the adiabatic evolution and destroys the fine structure of the probability histogram , see fig .",
