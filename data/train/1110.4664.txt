    "the lowest - temperature brown dwarfs ",
    "the l , t and y dwarfs  span an astrophysically - rich parameter space of mass , temperature and atmospheric chemistry that bridges the lowest - mass stars and the warmest exoplanets ( and references therein ) .",
    "these sources also probe the efficiency of low - mass star formation and the chemical enrichment history of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "very low - temperature brown dwarfs down to effective temperatures ( t@xmath6s ) of @xmath7300500  k are now being identified ( e.g. , @xcite ) , primarily in deep , wide - field infrared surveys such as the united kingdom infrared telescope deep sky survey ( ukidss ; @xcite ) ; the canada - france brown dwarf survey ( cfbds ; ) and , most recently , the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ; @xcite ) .",
    "these discoveries probe previously unexplored realms of gas and condensate atmospheric chemistry @xcite , and encompass the newly identified y dwarf spectral class @xcite .",
    "while changes in spectral morphology are largely tied to changes in temperature , the transitions between late - type spectral classes also trace significant changes in atmospheric chemistry and dynamics .",
    "the m dwarf to l dwarf transition is accompanied by the formation of mineral condensates , which deplete the photosphere of metal oxide gases ( tio , vo ) and lead to more reddened optical and near - infrared spectral energy distributions .",
    "in addition , magnetic coronal and chromospheric emission drops precipitously across this m / l transition @xcite , the result of both increasingly neutral atmospheres @xcite and reduced magnetic field energy with reduced mass @xcite .",
    "the l dwarf to t dwarf transition , signaled by the emergence of ch@xmath2 absorption at near - infrared wavelengths , is coincident with the removal of mineral condensate clouds from the photosphere @xcite and the increased influence of non - equilibrium chemistry on observed molecular abundances @xcite . given the very recent discovery of y dwarfs , transitional behaviors have yet to be explored at these spectral types , although atmospheric models predict the formation of salt and water condensates that may significantly shift photospheric chemistry and spectral appearance ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "ideal probes of such spectral transitions are physical binaries whose components straddle the corresponding classes .",
    "these presumably coeval systems share a common age and bulk chemical composition , and reside at a common distance , making relative comparisons less dependent on these parameters .",
    "for example , evidence for a rapid dissipation of clouds at the l dwarf / t dwarf transition includes the apparent brightening of early t dwarfs at 1  @xmath4 as observed among l / t transition binaries @xcite , and the higher apparent multiplicity rate of these systems @xcite .",
    "physical parameters such as age , mass and radii have also been measured for low - mass binaries ; these serve as critical empirical constraints for evolutionary models ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "finally , companions to low - luminosity sources are frequently low - temperature extrema .",
    "the prototypes for both the l dwarf ( gd 165b ; @xcite ) and t dwarf ( gliese  229b ; @xcite ) spectral classes were identified as companions to low - luminosity stars , as were two of the coldest brown dwarfs currently known , wd 0806 - 661b @xcite and cfbdsir  j1458 + 1013b @xcite .",
    "one of the first very late - type t dwarfs to be uncovered by the wise survey was wisep  j045853.90 + 643452.6 ( hereafter wise  j0458 + 6434 ; @xcite ) , a t8.5 dwarf at an estimated distance of 10  pc from the sun .",
    "subsequent adaptive optics ( ao ) imaging observations by @xcite revealed this source to be a binary with a separation of 0@xmath85 and a relative brightness of @xmath9 = 0.98@xmath100.08 .",
    "given the late spectral type of the composite spectrum and the significant magnitude difference between the components , wise  j0458 + 6434b was estimated to have a t9 spectral type and t@xmath6 @xmath11 500  k. however , uncertainties in the distance of this system , the unknown spectral energy distribution of the secondary , and the very recent empirical definition of the y dwarf spectral class @xcite means that wise  j0458 + 6434ab could potentially straddle the t dwarf / y dwarf transition .    in this article , we present resolved near - infrared imaging and spectroscopy of the wise  j0458 + 6434 system obtained with the keck ii nirc2 camera , oh - suppressing infrared integral field spectrograph ( osiris ; @xcite ) and laser guide star adaptive optics system ( lgsao ; @xcite ) .",
    "these data confirm common proper motion for the system and the first evidence for orbital motion .",
    "we use the @xmath0-band osiris spectra to classify the components , and identify tentative evidence for near - infrared nh@xmath3 absorption in wise  j0458 + 6434b . in section  2",
    "we describe our observations and data reduction methods . in section",
    "3 we analyze our astrometric measurements , and provide an initial qualitative characterization of the binary orbit .",
    "in section  4 we analyze the spectral data , deriving classifications using both spectral templates and @xmath0-band indices , and examining evidence for nh@xmath3 absorption . in section  5",
    "we discuss our results , focusing on the absolute magnitudes of wise  j0458 + 6434ab in the context of the t dwarf / y dwarf transition .",
    "new high - resolution lgsao imaging observations of wise j0458 + 6434 were obtained with nirc2 on the 10 m keck ii telescope on 2011 august 29 ( ut ) .",
    "conditions were clear with seeing of 0@xmath85 .",
    "data were obtained with the narrow plate scale mode of nirc2 ( 9.963@xmath100.011 mas pixel@xmath12 ; @xcite ) at an orientation of 0@xmath13 and airmass @xmath111.5 .",
    "we observed the target in the @xmath14- , @xmath0- and @xmath15-band filters using a 3-point dither pattern that avoided the noisy , lower left quadrant of the focal plane array .",
    "individual exposure times were 120  s in @xmath14 and @xmath15 and 300  s in @xmath0 , for total integrations of 360  s , 900  s and 360  s in @xmath14 , @xmath0 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the sodium lgs provided the wave front reference source for ao correction , while tip - tilt aberrations and quasi - static changes were measured by monitoring the @xmath16 = 15.6 field star usno - b1.0 1545 - 0122611 @xcite located @xmath17 = 27@xmath87 from wise  j0458 + 6434 .",
    "images were reduced using custom idl scripts .",
    "sky background and dark current were removed from each image by pairwise subtracting it with the following image in the dither sequence , then dividing by a normalized dome flat to correct for pixel - to - pixel sensitivity variations .",
    "the calibrated image frames were registered to the peak of the primary s point spread function ( psf ) , then median - combined to produce the final mosaics shown in figure  [ fig_image ] .             the quality of these data",
    "are significantly improved over the discovery observations from @xcite , with components that are well - separated in the field - of - view ( fov ) .",
    "relative fluxes were computed using aperture photometry on the coadded images . given the wide separation of the components , no psf subtraction or other specialized procedures were required for the photometry .",
    "the radial separation and position angle of the fainter component with respect to the brighter component was measured on each of the nine individual exposures .",
    "the values listed in table  [ tab_astrometry ] report the average and standard deviation of those nine measurements .",
    "relative @xmath14- and @xmath0-band flux measurements are in excellent agreement with those reported in @xcite , but are of far greater precision .",
    "in contrast , there is a significant shift in the relative separation of the two components , with @xmath18 = 54@xmath1014  mas and @xmath19 = 27@xmath1016  mas .",
    "notably , this shift is largely in a radial direction .",
    "we discuss the astrometry in further detail in section  3 .",
    "resolved spectroscopy of wise  j0458 + 6434 was obtained with osiris and lgsao on 2011 february 3 ( ut ) , in clear conditions with seeing of 0@xmath88 - 1@xmath80 .",
    "the 50  mas - scale camera and h@xmath20 filter were employed , providing 1.471.80  @xmath4 spectroscopy at an average resolution of 3800 and dispersion of 2.1    pixel@xmath12 over a 0@xmath88@xmath213@xmath82 fov .",
    "the source was first acquired in the imaging camera , then offset to the spectrograph array .",
    "the image rotator was set to 0@xmath13 .",
    "eight exposures of 600  s each were obtained over an airmass range of 1.401.52 using a two - step dither pattern with steps of 1@xmath80 along the long axis of the fov . for lgsao tip - tilt correction",
    ", we employed the same star as that used for the nirc2 imaging . we also obtained four 30s observations of the a0  v star bd  + 64  489 ( @xmath22 = 9.43 ) in natural guide star ao mode at an airmass of 1.72 for telluric correction and flux calibration purposes .",
    "data were reduced with the osiris data reduction pipeline @xcite , version 2.3 .",
    "we first subtracted from the source and calibrator images median - combined sets of dark frames with identical exposure times .",
    "we then used the pipeline to adjust bias levels , remove detector artifacts and cosmic rays , extract and wavelength - calibrate the position - dependent spectra ( using the most current rectification files as of february 2011 ) , assemble 3d data cubes and correct for dispersion .",
    "figure  [ fig_image ] displays a 1@xmath23@xmath211@xmath23 section of this cube coadded over the wavelength range 1.561.60  @xmath4 .",
    "the two components are cleanly resolved , separated by @xmath710  spaxels ( 0@xmath85 ) along a nw - se axis .",
    "the full width at half maximum of the psf was measured to be 150  mas ( 3 spaxels ) over this wavelength range for both components , slightly elongated in the direction of the tip - tilt star .",
    "relative astrometry from these data were determined from each of the reduced data cubes , using a median stack over the spectral dimension 1.561.60  @xmath4 .",
    "the idl routine _ cntrd _ was used to measure the peak pixel positions of the primary and secondary in each image , and pixel separations along each axis were converted to angular separations in right ascension and declination .",
    "mean measurements and standard deviations are listed in table  [ tab_astrometry ] .",
    "the offsets are intermediate between those of the two nirc2 observations , consistent with a continuous reduction in separation over nearly constant position angle .",
    "spectra for both components of wise  j0458 + 6434 and the calibrator star were extracted directly from the data cube via aperture photometry in each image plane , using a 1.5-spaxel ( 75  mas ) aperture for wise  j0458 + 6434 and a 3-spaxel ( 150  mas ) aperture for bd  + 64  489 , with 1020  spaxel ( 0@xmath851@xmath80 ) sky annuli .",

    "flux calibration and telluric correction of the wise  j0458 + 6434ab spectra were performed using the _ xtellcor_general _ routine in spextool , assuming a 20  nm gaussian kernel to model the widths of the a0v h  i lines , and a kurucz model spectrum of vega @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig_spec ] displays the reduced spectra of the wise  j0458 + 6434 components .",
    "both are unambiguously late - type t dwarfs based on the presence of strong h@xmath1o absorption up to 1.55  @xmath4 and strong ch@xmath2 absorption beyond 1.59  @xmath4 .",
    "these bands constrain the @xmath0-band flux to a discrete 1.501.62  @xmath4 peak , which is narrower in the spectrum of wise  j0458 + 6434b .",

    "as noted above , astrometry from nirc2 and osiris observations of wise  j0458 + 6434 indicate a monotonic decrease in the separation of this pair along a near constant position angle of 320@xmath13 , with the separations in right ascension from the two nirc2 observations differing by nearby 4@xmath24 . to assess how this relative motion relates to systemic common motion , and hence physical association ,",
    "we compared our measurements against predicted separations anchored to our 2011 august 29 ( ut ) astrometry , considering three limiting scenarios : ( 1 ) the secondary is a background source with negligible parallactic or proper motion , ( 2 ) the secondary is at the same distance as the primary , but with negligible proper motion , and ( 3 ) the primary and secondary maintain constant separation at all times .",
    "figure  [ fig_astrometry ] shows that none of these scenarios are fully consistent with the data , although the last provides the closest match . allowing relative motions and distances to vary freely",

    "first , the photospheres of brown dwarfs are not homogeneous , and absorption contributing to this spectral region is integrated over a pathlength that spans a range of temperatures and pressures that do not necessary coincide with the values used here to calculate molecular opacities .",
    "second , the opacities of absorbers other than nh@xmath3 are also likely to differ between these two sources , which may add additional structure to the relative intensities .",
    "finally , while the excess absorption in wise  j0458 + 6434b is statistically significant , the precise location of the relative intensity peak is not robust due to the large uncertainties in the spectrum of wise  j0458 + 6434b at these ( low intensity ) wavelengths .",
    "hence , while evidence for nh@xmath3 absorption in the near - infrared spectrum of wise  j0458 + 6434b is compelling , confirmation of this will require higher signal - to - noise data and more detailed modeling of the spectrum .",
    "one of the benefits of studying a physical binary is that its components share a common distance . in the case of wise  j0458 + 6434ab , this allows us to bootstrap existing absolute magnitude / spectral type trends out to the end of the t dwarf sequence .",

    "additional absorption may also arise from water ice clouds that are expected to form at these temperatures , as scattering opacity from 10 - 100  @xmath4-sized ice grains would efficiently suppress near - infrared emission just as mineral grains are observed to do so in the l dwarfs @xcite . while an improved parallax measurement for wise  j1541@xmath52250 and other newly - discovered y dwarfs are needed to confirm this dramatic drop in near - infrared flux , these early indications suggest that the t / y transition , like other late spectral class transitions , may trace significant changes in atmospheric chemistry as well as declining temperatures .    the authors would like to thank keck observing assistants terry stickel and cynthia wilburn , and instrument scientists scott dahm and hien tran , for their assistance in the observations reported here .",
