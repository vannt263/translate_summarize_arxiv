    "recent progress in building devices for quantum information processing ( qip ) has lead to renewed interest in studying the relaxation times of electron spins bound to impurities and in quantum dots to be used for encoding quantum information @xcite .",
    "electron spins bound to shallow donors in si are characterized by particularly long relaxation times , since the spin orbit interaction is weak and isotopically enriched @xmath0si is available  @xcite .",
    "however a weak interdonor spin coupling represents a challenge for the controlled interaction of quantum bits .",
    "the interstitial lithium donor in silicon is unique amongst shallow donors because it has an inverted level structure and near degeneracy of the 1@xmath1 ground state manifold @xcite .",
    "the latter gives rise to a strong long - range elastic - dipole coupling of the neutral li donor _ orbital _ states @xcite , similar to that obtained earlier for acceptors in si @xcite but absent in the case of other donors . in @xcite a quantum computing architecture was proposed based on the stress - defined orbital qubits and the above interaction was used to enable 2-qubit gates . at the same time the near degeneracy of 1@xmath1 manifold in si : li also gives rise to a nontrivial coupling between the spin and orbital degrees of freedom first investigated by watkins and ham @xcite .",
    "one can expect that the inverted level structure and near degeneracy in si : li will lead to a very short electron spin relaxation times which can also strongly affect orbital relaxation and be detrimental for qip .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , in view of extensive studies of spin relaxation of other shallow donors in silicon since the early sixties , both experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite , the question about li spin relaxation has not been addressed .    in this work",
    "we propose a new relaxation mechanism for coupled donor electron spin and orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "it is based on ( i ) our new finding of the chiral symmetry of the donor states that persists in prsence of the random starin and magnetic field of certain orientations and ( ii ) an interplay between the umklapp phonon processes and a short - range electric dipole interaction that only weakly break this symmetry and enable spin relaxation . as a result li",
    "electron spin and orbital relaxation times become very long in the presence of modest external stress ( @xmath2 10@xmath3 pa ) at temperatures below 0.3 k. we also report pulsed esr measurements of the longitudinal spin relaxation time t@xmath4 in @xmath5si : li at temperatures 1.8 to 4.5  k. we find that in the absence of external stress these times are shorter than our instrumental resolution ( @xmath6 100 ns ) at temperatures as low as 1.8 k. this rapid relaxation is caused by the degeneracy in the ground state manifold . however , a modest applied stress lifts the degeneracy , and leads to a much longer relaxation , as will be discussed below .",

    "to conclude , we introduced a new spin - orbital relaxation mechanism for li donors in si and predicted theoretically that the longitudinal spin relaxation @xmath192 time of a li donor in si under the uniaxial compressive stress and magnetic field aligned along the @xmath193,@xmath194 or @xmath195 axis can be very large ( hours ) for @xmath134  @xmath6  0.3  k despite the inverted level structure of interstitial li donor as compared to group v substitutional donors in silicon .",
    "the orbital relaxation time is 0.1 msec at that temperature . by virtue of the chirality selection rules for the electron - phonon interaction ,",
    "the donor electron spin can decay only via inter - valley umklapp processes or a very weak direct phonon process caused by a small li off - site displacement misalignment . at higher temperatures @xmath192 is reduced to a @xmath33s range due to thermal population of the lower excited states which in turn promotes fast transitions within the same chiral subspace allowed by the parity - selection rules .",
    "we obtained a very close ( within few per cent ) agreement with pulsed esr measurements of @xmath192 times at @xmath196  k ( 12  @xmath33s ) and at @xmath197  k ( 1.5  @xmath33s ) that corroborates our prediction of extremely long - lived spin states of li donors in si at lower temperatures . since the chiralty is a universal property of the silicon host ur study can be applied to substitutional donors in si with similar near - degeneracy of the 1@xmath71 coupled to the ground state via stray electric fields and umklapp processes .",
    "our results of the very long li spin lifetime can also stimulate the analysis of the possibility of li spin - based qip applications with direct long - range elastic - dipole interaction between the li donor spins similar to that considered in @xcite .",
