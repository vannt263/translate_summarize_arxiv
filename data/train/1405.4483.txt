    "after success on the quantum ground state achievable @xcite , the current challenge now is to know how far quantum theory , bizarre as it is , can allow the observation of quantum effects @xcite .",
    "a suitable effect that can inform us about this quantum theory s limit is quantum entanglement , since it is a distinguishing feature that separates quantum from classical physics .",
    "quantum entanglement plays an important role in sharing information in quantum networks @xcite .",
    "in particular , the continuous - variable ( cv ) entangled quantum states constitute a key element to challenge quantum communication processes such as quantum cryptography @xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum dense coding @xcite , and quantum computational tasks @xcite .",
    "many theoretical and experimental schemes have been proposed to generate cv entangled quantum states @xcite . according to the great interest in the nanomechanics during this past decade , optomechanical systems @xcite , superconducting microwave cavities @xcite , and",
    "hybrid systems @xcite have been very recently used as a tool for generating strong cv entangled quantum states .",
    "this consists in coupling the optical and/or microwave mode to the mechanical mode of the resonator that vibrates under the electromagnetic field .",
    "there are many configurations that have been proposed to this end . in @xcite , stationary entanglement between the optical field and the mechanical mode of a vibrating end mirror",
    "is generated from the optical fabry - prot cavity .",
    "strong quantum correlation between the mirror and the optical stokes sideband is explained in @xcite as being generated by a scattering process .",
    "the configuration used in @xcite consists of a whispering - gallery mode cavity with a movable boundary .",
    "entanglement between the mechanical and radiation modes is achieved in @xcite by using a suitable modulation of the driving field .",
    "a pulsed field is used to create einstein - podolsky - rosen - type entanglement between the mechanical mode and light pulses and microwave pulses respectively in optomechanical cavity @xcite and a microwave cavity , respectively @xcite . in @xcite , a membrane - in - the - middle geometry",
    "is used to generate output entangled light from a fixed end fabry - prot cavity .",
    "the optical - microwave quantum interface is used in @xcite to a produce robust entangled signal that can be used for high - fidelity transfer of quantum states between optical and microwave fields .",
    "all these schemes aim to generate robust entangled states against decoherence , which limits their lifetime @xcite and their performance in quantum applications .",
    "this decoherence is often manifested by various factors such as the stability conditions that place constraints on the magnitude of the effective optomechanical couplings and the thermal noise of the mechanical mode .",
    "recent experimental studies have shown that a cantilever nanobeam can exhibit both stiffening ( @xmath0 ) and softening ( @xmath1 ) geometrical nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "this intrinsic anharmonicity in the mechanical motion of micromechanical and nanomechanical resonators is usually small and therefore only relevant in the regime of large oscillation amplitudes where its contribution becomes important @xcite . in order to detect quantum behavior ,",
    "it is a common approach to introduce nonlinearities in the quantum system @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that the dynamics of the purely harmonic quantum system is analogous to its classical dynamics , in the sense that expectation values of canonical observables follow the classical equations of motion . indeed , stiffening geometrical nonlinearity has being used to squeeze the mechanical mode in optomechanical systems @xcite and for both quantum control and quantum information processing @xcite whereas softening nonlinearity is shown as a factor that limits some quantum effects in optomechanics @xcite .    in this paper , motivated by the recent experimental parameters of ref .",
    "@xcite , we propose a scheme that generates robust cv entanglement against thermal decoherence .",
    "this consists to take into account the geometrical nonlinearity which makes a correction on the dynamics of the resonator , in the limit of large displacements @xcite .",
    "such a scheme can be extended to superconducting microwave circuits and hybrid systems @xcite .",
    "section [ sec : model ] describes the system used and details the mathematical tools for the entanglement .",

    "the first term of the hamiltonian describes both the energy of the cavity mode and the radiation pressure coupling of the rate @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the cavity frequency and cavity length , respectively .",
    "the second term is the anharmonic mechanical energy of the nanoresonator with @xmath18 the anharmonic term .",
    "the third term is the input driving by a laser with frequency @xmath19 , where the amplitude of the input laser beam @xmath20 is related to the input laser power @xmath21 by @xmath22 .",
    "the laser - cavity detuning is defined as @xmath23 .",
    "the aforementioned nonlinear term occurs in the system when the nanoresonator is subjected to large displacement amplitudes .",
    "this comes about because the flexure causes the beam to lengthen , which at large amplitudes adds a significant correction to the overall elastic response of the beam @xcite .",
    "depending on the sign of this nonlinearity , one distinguishes the softening ( @xmath1 ) and the stiffening ( @xmath0 ) nonlinearity which both merge in the nanostructure dynamics .",
    "conceptually , a doubly clamped beam exhibits a stiffening nonlinearity and the cantilever has both stiffening and softening nonlinearity @xcite .",
