    "supernovae observations @xcite made just before the break of the millennium implies that the universe appears to be expanding at an increasing rate .",
    "a bit later made observations of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation @xcite supports the conclusions made out of the supernovae observations .",
    "the most popular ways of explaining these observations are with models based on friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) metric , which is based on general relativity and the principles of cosmological and copernican .",
    "the cosmological principle merely states that the universe is spatially homogeneous everywhere , whereas the copernican principle states that there are no preferred points in the universe .",
    "flrw metric and models based on it are extensively presented in the literature of cosmology ( see for example @xcite ) .    even though the flrw based models fit well inside the frame provided by our observations , it is also for long known to suffer some problems , for example the fine tuning problem @xcite and the cosmological constant problem @xcite .",
    "one of the strengths of the flrw based models is simplicity due to varies approximations , although , that can also be counted as a weakness .",
    "it is also questionable if all approximations are made acceptably , as is pointed out by shirokov and fisher @xcite , where is questioned if the homogeneity approximation should be done to the einstein tensor @xmath0 , rather than to the metric @xmath1 , since in general @xmath2 .",
    "however , the problem is more complex than this . as pointed out by shirokov and fisher @xcite ,",
    "einstein equations are no longer tensor equations after averaging in the sense , that they can not be changed _",
    "e.g. _ from covariant form to contravariant form with metric tensor without altering the equations . in this perspective",
    "it seems , that only tensors rank 0 and scalars have well validated averages . for this kind of approach",
    "see buchert @xcite , where he transforms the einstein equations into scalar equations before averaging .",
    "it is very much possible that the problems flrw based models suffer are due to approximations , and solely the work of shirokov , fisher and buchert implies that the first approximation to investigate more is the homogeneity .",
    "such a model was first introduced by lematre @xcite , and later on studied by tolman @xcite and its called lematre - tolman ( lt ) model . for further developments of the model",
    "see @xcite . the lt model",
    "have not yet been studied as widely as flrw based models , hence all the problems it suffers have probably not yet been discovered , but it have already shown its power by overcoming some of the problems of the flrw based models .",
    "for example , mattsson has shown that the lt model can explain the main cosmological observations without dark energy.@xcite    actually , flrw based models are often presented including early times inflation , which solves the fine tuning problem .",
    "this solution can not be generalized to lt model _ a prior _ , because the evolution of the universe in lt model is dependent in coordinate distance , which would make the inflation occur differently in separate locations , and the consequences of this are unknown . however , inflation is not the only possible explanation for the homogeneous tendency of cosmological observations .",
    "we explore the possibility that the structure of the equations governing the evolution of the universe is such , that it has a inbuilt property to make everything appear as observed .",
    "we study the existence of this property by using phase space analysis .",
    "the aim is to find restrictions to viable and stable solutions of the differential equations governing the universe in the lt model .",
    "viable solutions mean here that the solutions are consistent with the observations .",
    "stable solutions include such solutions , which are attracted towards the universe we observe ; therefore these kind of solutions do not need fine tuning of initial state .",
    "especially interesting cases are where the dark energy is absent .",
    "it is also interesting to see , if our results offers insight to the homogeneity approximation . by that we mean , if all the viable and stable lt models are approximately homogeneous .",
    "this subject however is not going to be important in this paper , but it is merely pointed out as a possibility what more can our results offer .    the focus of the present paper is to introduce a novel method to use stability analysis and its general features with the lematre - tolman model , which is done in section ii . in section iia ,",
    "homogeneous cases in general are applied to the methods found out . in sections",
    "iib and iic pressure free , flat and homogeneous universe is investigated , in the cases of dust filled and dust and dark energy filled universes , using the phase space analysis . finally in section iii",
    "the results are discussed .",
    "realistic applications where viable and stable inhomogeneous models are to be determined are left to forthcoming publications .",

    "@xmath4 is matter density and @xmath5 is the local four - velocity .",
    "as the coordinates are assumed to be comoving , the four - velocity is simply @xmath6 .",

    "( [ de ] ) is a second order non - linear differential equation , from which can be solved @xmath34 as a function of @xmath7 .",

    "this means that we can use practically interchangeably the two parameter @xmath7 or @xmath20 .",
    "analyzing cosmological data will give us functions @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 explicitly with respect to @xmath34 , but even now when",
    "the explicit forms are unknown , general remarks can be done on what kind of systems eq .",
    "( [ de ] ) can describe .",
    "the phase plane can be divided into sections each having its own characteristics .",
    "some of the properties can be read out from general properties of the equations and represented as a flow plot in @xmath40-plane .",
    "the @xmath41-axis represents location of observations ( earth ) at present time ; the redshift is there zero . on the right hand side of the @xmath41-axis is past or distant objects and the left hand side of the @xmath41-axis can be interpreted as future . on the @xmath34-axis @xmath42 , hence it represents apparently static universe . above the @xmath34-axis @xmath43 ,",
    "the area represents apparently ( and locally ) expanding space , and below the @xmath34-axis @xmath44 the apparently contracting one .",
    "therefore , due to the observations , we are mostly interested of the first quarter of a phase space plane , past of an expanding universe ; however , we do not want to exclude other parts of the phase plane _ per se _ , but we give the first quarter of the phase space plane most of our interest .",
    "looking to the latter of the eqs .",
    "( [ psa_general ] ) one sees , that whenever @xmath45 the flow arrows points right , and when @xmath46 they points left . the curves where @xmath47 or @xmath48 is zero are called nullclines and the points where @xmath47 and @xmath48 is zero are called fixed points . in the system ( [ psa_general ] ) all the points on curve @xmath49 are fixed points , which means that the curve @xmath49 is fixed .",

    "are here chosen to be @xmath61 or @xmath62 for simplicity .",
    "the dashed curve is the nullcline @xmath63 . ]",
    "consider now the situation where functions @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 are formed from observational data .",
    "( [ psa_general ] ) is now given explicitly , so phase plane can be drawn and the best fit curve compared to observations can be fitted .",
    "it is assumable that the best fit curve coincides closely to the best fit to the observations in the isotropic and homogeneous models , which means that the best fit curve is not very `` lumpy '' and is approximately monotonic .",
    "now , consider each observable separately .",
    "each of them have their own trajectory , which are unknown to us , because we do not have enough data from each observable .",
    "but if we had enough data from each observable , we could draw their trajectories on the same phase plane that the best fit curve is on .",
    "so , each observable have their own trajectory , but still they seem to sit on a approximately monotonic curve , the best fit curve . in our scheme",
    "this appears to happen only , if the flow arrows are pointing towards the best fit curve .",
    "this would ensure that for large number of initial values , observables end up ( after long enough time period ) near by to the best fit curve .",
    "this issue , however , is not that simple and it will be discussed more in section conclusions and discussion .    at simplest the interest in phase plane analysis is concentrated into the existence and properties of the fixed points . in this case",
    "however , observations suggests that the best fit curve should be attractive . in the system ( [ psa_general ] ) only @xmath34-axis can be referred as a attractive curve , but its nature as apparent static universe is not what is observed .",
    "however , nullclines can be thought of to be attractive like , since flow arrows can point towards them as in _ e.g. _ the low - right case in fig .",
    "[ k1 ] . in our system",
    "the only physically interesting possible attractive like nullcline is @xmath51 .",
    "however , the exact identification between the nullcline and the best fit curve can not be done , because then both eqs . @xmath64 and ( [ de ] ) should be satisfied simultaneously causing either the solution @xmath65 be linear or @xmath50 , but it is not even necessary as long as the identification can satisfy observations inside their inaccuracy limits .    the properties of the system ( [ psa_general ] )",
    "discussed above implies that the curve @xmath64 can be attractive in the first quarter of the phase plane only if @xmath31 is positive and @xmath32 and @xmath66 are negative . even though these boundaries are necessary , they are far from sufficient for the following reason .",
    "consider a situations where @xmath67 , and @xmath68 and the value of the slope of the curve @xmath64 , @xmath69 , is positive . on the curve @xmath64",
    "is always @xmath70 , thus flow arrows on the curve are horizontal and pointing right , _",
    "i.e. _ , the slopes of the flow arrows @xmath71 are zero .",
    "now , approaching the curve from below vertically makes @xmath72 to approach zero . at some distance to @xmath64",
    "before @xmath72 reaches to zero , it becomes smaller than @xmath73 .",
    "this means that the solution is no longer approaching the curve @xmath74 , because flow arrows determine the slopes and the progressing directions of the solutions in each point .",
    "similar situation occur , if at fixed @xmath34 we approach the curve @xmath64 from above and @xmath75 .",
    "this is also why nullclines are rather attractive like than attractive .",
    "as it follows , we need more sufficient methods to measure the attractivity of the nullcline @xmath64 .",
    "especially , we need a method to measure the distance from the nullcline where it stops acting as an attractor . in the present paper for this",
    "is used the following method .",
    "let us consider our system on area @xmath76 with positive @xmath31 and negative @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the nullcline @xmath51 is attractive like , if flow arrows around it points towards it . now below the nullcline flow arrows point up - right and above the curve they point down - right .",
    "the slope of the nullcline is positive and all the flow arrows above it points towards it , but the flow arrows below it points towards it only if the slopes of the flow arrows @xmath77 at some given @xmath34 are greater than the slope of the nullcline @xmath73 at the same @xmath34 .",
    "let @xmath78 be the ( vertical ) distance from the nullcline @xmath51 .",
    "the slope of the flow arrow at given @xmath34 and distance @xmath79 below the nullcline is :    y_z^- & : = & _ y =- j(z)/k(z ) + & = & _ y =- j(z)/k(z ) + & = & -_y =- j(z)/k(z ) + & = & -_y =- j(z)/k(z ) + & = & _ y. from eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) one can explicitly see , that the size of the vertical step @xmath79 taken from the nullcline effects to the attractiveness in a linear fashion : the larger the step is , more attracitve like the nullcline seems .",
    "this means that @xmath79 takes a role of a parameter comparable to observational inaccuracies .",
    "hence , the slopes of the flow arrows @xmath77 are greater than the slope of the nullcline @xmath73 at at some given @xmath34 , if _",
    "y > y_z = -+k_z(z ) .",
    "the above inequality is the restriction we use to study the attractiveness of the nullcline @xmath80 .      to give more concrete touch of our prescription",
    ", we check how the method works with isotropic and homogeneous models .",
    "note , that flrw metric can not be used here , because it is not compatible with our gauge choice @xmath81 .",

    "phase space analysis is used to find out if there is isotropic dust source models describing the universe without fine tuning the initial state . in general with inhomogeneous models ,",
    "it is not always reasonable to use term initial state to refer only to the state of the system at big bang time , but sometimes also later times .",
    "this is due to observations : there is no observations of each location at all time during the entire history of the universe .",
    "the big bang might of occurred at different times in different regions , and the regions might of evolved completely differently compared to each other .",
    "hence , here the term is not fixed to some particular time or place , but is rather determined for each case separately , whatever is most convenient for the situation",
    ". often we use it to refer to the time relatively near in the past of each observable , but there are some exceptions , such as homogeneous case , which are discussed more later .    when cosmological observations are plotted on the @xmath166-plane , the curve that is the best fit to those plots is the curve we refer as the best fit curve .",
    "an cosmological observable to be observed in the vicinity of the best fit curve today , does not demand that the observable have to evolve towards the curve throughout its history ; it only needs to be there when observed .",
    "a single observable could in principle move repeatedly towards and away from the curve during its entire history , as long as it locates close enough the curve when we observe it . though the amount of observables basically eliminates this kind of excessive behavior , but a reasonable situation would be where each observable at some point approach the best fit curve and stay close enough before observed",
    "the interpretation of the dynamical equations simplifies in the case of homogeneous models , as the initial state is same everywhere and the big bang time occurred simultaneous everywhere ; none of the quantities in equations governing the evolution are dependent of @xmath7 , and the evolution have been similar always and everywhere .",
    "thus , the minimum requirement for a flrw metric based on model to be viable and stable enough is , that there has been a period where it have evolved towards the best fit curve and located inside boundaries given by observation inaccuracies since .",
    "this is the minimum requirement in the sense , that there was at least one early period where the best fit curve was attractive .",
    "the given example of the dust and dark matter filled case have an era where redshift is approaching the best fit curve : about 9.70 - 9.85 gyrs ago .",
    "hence the model could explain almost the last 10 gyrs .",
    "thus the model can not explain oldest observations .",
    "this is not surprising : as it is well known , without inflation homogeneous models have a fine tuning problem of matter and energy density.@xcite in the light of this paper , the stability is not a inbuilt feature at least in the cases studied in this paper , and can not replace the widely excepted solution of early time inflation for the fine tuning problem .",
    "analogous results are expected for almost homogeneous cases , where initial state does not vary too much with respect to @xmath7 and the evolution can be though of almost similar everywhere : observations can be explained without fine tuning the initial values , if at some point in the history before cmb there was a period where the universe evolved towards the best fit curve ( and have been close enough it since ) .",
    "thus we can conclude , that if the observed universe have not had a period in its history before cmb where the boundary condition we gave is satisfied , lt model can not explain its homogeneous nature without fine tuning .",
    "the redshift values where the system is not defined , singular limits , causes difficulties for analysis . in this paper",
    "singular limits are not studied , and it is left to forthcoming publications .",
    "nevertheless , one note of singular limits should be brought out here . in fig .",
    "[ kuva_molemmat_faasi ] is illustrated what happens close by @xmath125 , where the system is not defined .",
    "even a slightest variation from today s observed value of @xmath114 seams to lead a solution into very different direction at the singular limit . on the other hand , if we would of drawn the phase plane with _",
    "@xmath167 , the solution with @xmath167 would of approached towards point @xmath168 and the solutions with @xmath169 and @xmath170 would of approached towards the @xmath34-axis .",
    "this may be a sign , for example , of an instability of the model or of a break down of the used method at this @xmath34 value and its close neighborhood .",
    "as singular limits in general , also this phenomena is planned to be investigated thoroughly later .",
    "the overall view our analysis cast on inhomogeneous models is not very promising .",
    "the best fit curve that should be attractive like is approximately given with eq .",
    "( [ observations_de_matter ] ) , thus increasing at rate @xmath171 with large @xmath34 values , and rapid increase of the curve makes it more unlikely to be attractive like .",
    "the situation seems to get worse if pressure is taken into account , since the increasing rate is then proportional to @xmath172 with large redshift .",
    "however , it is possible for observationally acceptable inhomogeneous ( and therefore also homogeneous ) models to be attractive like even with large @xmath34 values , hence it needs to be investigated .",
    "the situation , however , is not necessarily as bad as it looks , since even though pressure at first seems to make the situation worse , it may actually recover it .",
    "this is due to the chances pressure brings with it to the evolution equation .",
    "for example , if the evolution equation changes from second order differential equation to higher order one , it may chance the structure of the stability of the system dramatically",
    ". this may even happen for homogeneous models , thus the result here received for dust and dark energy filled universe should not be interpreted as final .",
