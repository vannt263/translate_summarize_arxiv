    "predictions and structure studies of superheavy elements ( she ) have been made , since the establishment of the nuclear shell model@xcite . especially in the last decade , elaborate investigations have been performed of shell correction energy and thereby of a possible location of the superheavy island in the nuclear chart . furthermore , not only about the center of the island , but also about stability properties of nearby nuclei have been being investigated , which is useful for the extension of the nuclear chart in heavy and superheavy elements@xcite . on the other hand , studies of nuclear reaction mechanisms have not been developed so much , though so - called fusion - hindrance was experimentally found to exist in heavy ion fusions and inferred to be due to energy dissipation@xcite .",
    "that is , there is no reliable theoretical framework which enables us to predict fusion probability of massive systems and thereby residue cross sections of she properly .",
    "thus , which combination of incident ions is most promising and what incident energy is an optimum is not yet predicted theoretically .",
    "therefore , the fusion experiments have been performed , based on systematics of data available so far@xcite .",
    "based on the reaction theory of the compound nucleus@xcite , residue cross sections are given as follows ,    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is the wave length divided by @xmath2 and @xmath3 the total angular momentum of the system .",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath5 are fusion and survival probabilities , respectively . in the present paper , we discuss several difficult problems inherent in synthesis of the superheavy elements with brief explanations of a few progresses of our understanding , as well as attempts of realistic calculations .",
    "in order to obtain the fusion probability , we have to take into account possible mechanisms for the fusion - hindrance .",
    "otherwise , calculated probabilities , and fusion cross sections would be unrealistic , as it is the case that one uses a transmission coefficient of an optical model or a barrier penetration factor as the fusion probability .",
    "as for possible origins of the hindrance , two mechanisms are proposed .",
    "one is dissipation of incident energy in the course of two - body collisions and thus probability for the system to overcome the coulomb barrier is reduced@xcite .",
    "the other one is dissipation of energy of collective motions of the amalgamated system which has to overcome a conditional saddle or a ridge line in order to reach the spherical shape , i.e. , the compound nucleus@xcite .",
    "thus , the probability for reaching the spherical shape is also reduced .",
    "it is natural to consider that both exist . in other words ,",
    "the fusion probability @xmath4 consists of two factors ; the sticking probability @xmath6 of two incident ions after overcoming the coulomb barrier and the formation probability @xmath7 of the spherical shape after overcoming the conditional saddle point , starting from a pear - shaped configuration made by the sticking of the incident ions@xcite .",
    "@xmath8    since the existence of the saddle point or the ridge line between a pear- shape made by the incident ions and the spherical shape is typical in very heavy systems , the latter mechanism would be indispensable for the fusion- hindrance observed in massive systems , though the former would also play a role ( note that in lighter heavy - ion systems the amalgamated shape is usually located inside the ridge line , so the system eventually slides down to the spherical shape with probability being equal to 1 , once the incident ions stick to each other , though fluctuations to be discussed below may reduce it only slightly ) . in either mechanism , we have to describe a passing over a barrier under energy dissipation , which is not yet well understood theoretically@xcite and thereby there is no useful formula ready for practical applications .",
    "this is quite contrast to a similar problem , i.e. , to fission under dissipation , where a famous kramers formula@xcite for decay rate is known to well describe a process of a system inside a potential pocket leaking over the fission barrier .",
    "an essential difference is that in the latter the initial system is in the quasi - equilibrium in the pocket , while in the former the initial state is given by the condition of two incident ions with a given incident c.m.energy .",
    "recently , the present author and his collaborators have proposed a new analytic formula for the probability of passing over a parabolic barrier under frictional force .",
    "we have applied this formula to the problem of passing - over a conditional saddle point , and obtained a simple expression for so - called extra - push energy which provides a clear understanding of the fusion hindrance@xcite .",
    "this would be an important contribution to study of fusion mechanisms and is briefly recapitulated in section 3 . , but there still remains a difficulty in practice .",
    "the parabolic shape is usually a good approximation for barrier shapes , but in potential landscapes calculated with the liquid drop model ( ldm ) a pocket inside the saddle is very shallow in nuclei corresponding to the superheavy elements , as is easily expected from the fissility parameter @xmath9 being close to 1 .",
    "therefore , the potential is expected to be substantially asymmetric around the saddle , and moreover a system once passing over the saddle may return back with an appreciable probability due to the fluctuation associated with the friction . of course , the probability for return - back to re - separation is reduced if the system is cooled down by neutron emissions and restores the shell correction energy which makes the pocket deeper .    for a quantitative prediction",
    ", those features should be taken into account properly , which is made by numerically solving a langevin equation@xcite .",
    "for a dynamical description of shape evolutions , we have to solve trajectories in a multi - dimensional space of shape parameterization with a realistic ldm potential , examples of which are discussed in section 5 . but a time - dependent shell correction energy due to evaporation of neutrons is not yet taken into account in fusion processes .",
    "( since time for fusion process is expected to be rather short , this would not cause a serious inaccuracy , but is properly done in the calculation of survival probability , as will be discussed in sections 6 .",
    "and 7 . ) in the approaching phase of passing over the coulomb barrier under friction , we have to take into account a dissipation of the orbital angular momentum as well as that of the kinetic energy of the radial motion , where a coupling between them is not described by a quadratic potential , as is discussed in section 4 .",
    "of course , there are many other effects which may play a role in the latter process , say , effects of deformations of incident ions , quantum tunneling effects etc . , which are not yet fully investigated .",
    "as for the survival probability , the statistical theory of decay is well established for obtaining a probability for the system to survive against fission and charged particle decay .",
    "but in practice there are ambiguities in the physical parameters , i.e. , so - called level - density parameter @xmath10 and the shell damping energy @xmath11 which controls restoration of the shell correction energy by cooling .",
    "especially , the latter is crucially important , because the restoring shell correction energy gives rise to an additional fission barrier effectively which controls survival probability , which is discussed qualitatively in section 6 . and quantitatively in section 7 .",
    "in addition , there are kramers@xcite and collective enhancement factors@xcite in fission decay widths to be taken into account .",
    "these are briefly discussed and examples of realistic calculations on @xmath12ca+ actinide targets are presented which are made by employing a new statistical code kewpie@xcite for the survival probabilities , in section 6 .",
    "we study a problem of obtaining a probability for passing over a potential barrier under a frictional force , which originates from interactions of the degree of freedom under investigation with a heat bath , i.e. , with other degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore , there should be a random force associated with the friction in accord with the dissipation - fluctuation theorem .",
    "if we approximate the barrier with an inverted parabolic shape , the equation of motion for a coordinate @xmath13 and its associate momentum @xmath14 is written as follows ,    @xmath15    where @xmath16 denotes the inertia mass , and @xmath17 the curvature of the inverted parabola .",
    "@xmath18 is a reduced friction , i.e. , the friction @xmath19 divided by @xmath16 , while @xmath20 is its associated random force .",
    "the random force is assumed to be gaussian and satisfies the flowing properties ,    @xmath21    where @xmath22 signifies an average over all the possible realizations and the last equation given in eq .",
    "( 4 ) with temperature @xmath23 of the heat bath expresses the dissipation - fluctuation theorem .",
    "since the equation is linear , one can write down a general solution .    with this solution an general expression for a distribution function @xmath24 at any later time t",
    "is calculated , starting with the following definition ,    @xmath25    where @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote a general solution of eq .",
    "( 3 ) and is given by a linear combination of their initial value @xmath28 and @xmath29 with the coefficients including parameters @xmath18 and @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath30 again denotes the average over all the possible realizations of @xmath31 . using the path integral technique",
    ", we can perform the averaging and obtain the distribution function of the system as a gaussian distribution around the mean trajectory @xmath32@xcite .",
    "then , a probability for passing over the barrier is calculated by integrating over the whole @xmath14-space and the half @xmath13-space , and then by taking the limit of time @xmath33 to the infinity ,    @xmath34 , \\ ] ]    where @xmath35 denotes @xmath18 divided by @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath38 denote the initial kinetic energy @xmath39 and the barrier height measured from the initial potential energy @xmath40 , respectively .    in order for the probability to be 1/2 ,",
    "the argument of the error function should be equal to zero , which means that the mean trajectory just reaches at the top of the barrier overcoming the friction .",
    "then , the necessary critical kinetic energy @xmath41 is given as    @xmath42    where we can see that in the case of no friction , i.e. , of @xmath35 being equal to zero , @xmath43 , which is trivial .",
    "it clearly shows that @xmath41 is much larger than @xmath38 under the frictional force .",
    "if we estimate the first factor in eq .",
    "( 7 ) , assuming one - body wall - and - window formula ( obm@xcite ) for the friction @xmath19 , we obtain about 10 , depending on a reasonable choice of values for the inertia mass and the curvature of the potential calculated with ldm .",
    "this gives a simple formula for the extra - push energy , though we should be careful in a comparison with experimental data about effective one - dimensional quantities for @xmath38 , @xmath44 , @xmath17 and coulomb barrier heights of entrance channel etc .",
    "another interesting formula is obtained , which is very useful for synthesis of she .",
    "residue cross sections are extremely small in she , i.e. , we are facing with the situation where fusion probability is very small .",
    "this suggests in our present formulation that the mean trajectory does not reach the top of the barrier , even is far before the top , which means that the argument of the error function of eq .",
    "( 6 ) is very large .",
    "then , employing an asymptotic expansion of the error function , we can obtain a simple approximate formula for the formation probability @xmath7@xcite ,    @xmath45^{-1}\\\\\\nonumber \\cdot\\exp\\left[\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sqrt{x^2 + 1}+x}{2x}}\\left\\{\\sqrt{\\frac{b}{t}}-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x^2 + 1}+x}\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{t}}\\right\\}\\right ] , \\ ] ]    where it is interesting to note that there is a factor very similar to arrhenius factor which is typical in thermal activation processes such as nuclear fission , neutron evaporation , thermal electron emission from metal , etc .",
    "the exact arrhenius factor is obtained in case of a complete damping of the relative motion in the approaching phase , as follows . as will be shown in the next section ,",
    "a distribution of the radial momentum at the contact point is approximately expressed by a gaussian as a results of two - body collision processes and thus , the formation probability is obtained by a convolution over initial momentum @xmath29 , which results again in an error function of eq .",
    "( 6 ) with k being replaced with the average value @xmath46 and with the associated variance . in case of completely damping , @xmath46 is equal to zero , and the variance is equal to the temperature .",
    "accordingly , the corresponding asymptotic expansion gives the exact arrhenius factor .",
    "@xmath47 \\ ] ]    since fusion is inverse to fission in reaction directions , one could call this as an `` inverse kramers formula@xcite '' .",
    "but we should be careful that in the thermal activation processes the factor appears in decay rate or in emission rate per unit time , while in the present case it appears in the transition probability , i.e. , time - integrated quantity .",
    "anyhow , a physical meaning of the factor as well as of the pre - exponential factor are yet to be understood .    for actual fusion reactions ,",
    "one - dimensional treatment is obviously an over - simplification , which is readily understood by considering a mass - asymmetric entrance channel .",
    "in addition , neck formation etc . would come into play .",
    "it is worth to notice that even in such situations , i.e. , in multi - dimensional problems , we can derive the same type of formula as eq .",
    "( 6 ) , starting with an assumption of a quadratic potential generalized to a multi - dimension .",
    "that indicates that we can define an effective one - dimensional model .",
    "thus , the qualitative understandings obtained above with the schematic one - dimensional model are considered to be useful , with the barrier height etc .",
    "being considered to be effective quantities .",
    "one could apply the formula obtained in the previous section to passing - over coulomb barrier , approximating again the barrier as an inverted parabola . there , however , is another problem , as stated in section 2 . in the approaching phase ,",
    "dissipation of the orbital angular momentum comes into play , coupled with the radial motion . for the problem , the most simple and readily applicable model is the surface friction model ( sfm ) , proposed by gross and kalinowski@xcite in order to explain so - called deep - inelastic collisions .",
    "below , we reformulate it , starting with a general framework of ref .  [ 20 ] which includes so - called rolling friction . starting with intrinsic spins of the incident ions , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively , we introduce the following variables ,    @xmath50    where @xmath51 denotes an incident orbital angular momentum and @xmath52 , @xmath53 being 1 or 2 , is an effective ion radius defined as follows ,    @xmath54    where @xmath55 and @xmath56 with @xmath57 being the mass number of @xmath53-th ion .",

    "@xmath70 , @xmath53 being 1 and 2 , are the rigid moment of inertia of the incident ions which are assumed to be spherical .",

    "the former is much weaker than the latter , but for the moment we can not draw a definite conclusion on which one is correct or more realistic .",

    "if there is no friction , it should be always equal to 1 above the barrier height ( below the barrier , it is equal to zero , since the equation is classical . ) .",
    "but the results are not like that .",
    "it starts with an extremely small value at the barrier height energy and slowly increases to reach 1/2 about 12 mev above the barrier , which would explain a part of the extra - push .",
    "more interesting is that a distribution of the radial momentum calculated at the contact point is found to be approximately of a gaussian one with its average value being almost exactly equal to zero as shown in the middle panel of fig .  1 , which indicates that the relative motion is completely damped at the contact point .",
    "in fact , the average orbital angular momentum also approaches to the dissipation limit at the contact point , which is shown in the bottom panel of fig .  1 .",

    "the friction for the neck degree of the freedom is much stronger than the others and thus its motion is considered to be much slower than the other twos .",
    "then , we expect that two variables could describe the formation dynamics reasonably well , with the neck parameter @xmath101 freezed .",
