    "the physics potential of the international linear collider ( ilc ) depends greatly on precise energy measurements of the electron and positron beams at the interaction point ( ip ) .",
    "two types of analysis are particularly sensitive to the collision energy : threshold cross - section measurement and reconstruction of particle resonances @xcite .",
    "the required accuracy for the mass measurements dictate that the fractional error on the determination of the incoming beam energy must be better than @xmath0 . to measure the energy to this level and to minimise the disruption of the beam , a magnetic spectrometer has been proposed .",
    "when passing through a magnetic field , a particle with an electric charge @xmath3 is deflected by an angle @xmath4 which is inversely proportional to its energy @xmath5 : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the speed of light , @xmath8 is the magnetic field and @xmath9 is the path segment along which the particle travels .",
    "the initial ilc spectrometer proposal  @xcite suggested using a single bend and , with careful characterisation of the bending magnets and an accurate measurement of the bend angle @xmath4 , the energy of the beam could then be reconstructed .",
    "the performance of a similar spectrometer has already been demonstrated during the second phase of the large electron positron ( lep2 ) collider at cern @xcite .",
    "the magnetic spectrometer installed at lep2 achieved an accuracy of @xmath10 by measuring the change in bend angle as the beam passed through a single steel dipole magnet . to obtain the high accuracy required ,",
    "a relative energy measurement was made with the spectrometer calibrated at the @xmath11 resonance using the resonant depolarisation method , thus removing the need for an absolute angle measurement . in order to further improve the accuracy of the measurement , an average",
    "was taken over many bunches and many revolutions of the beam around the accelerator .",
    "this allowed the requirements on the bpm resolution to be relatively loose .",
    "as the ilc is a linear machine , resonant depolarisation is not an option for the beam energy measurement and in order to limit low energy operation , the ilc spectrometer will have to provide an absolute energy measurement .",
    "in addition , a bunch - by - bunch energy measurement is highly desirable to remove some of the dependence on the stability of the machine during physics data taking .",
    "these constraints , in addition to the required resolution of the energy measurement ( @xmath0 ) , force the performance of the combined bpm and electronics to be considerably higher than the system used at lep2 . in order to achieve this level of performance",
    ", high resolution cavity bpms will need to be used .",
    "however , as cavity bpms are sensitive to the beam slope as well as the beam offset , we are focusing our studies on a different approach to the energy measurement problem from the single bend method initially proposed .",
    "two identical magnets with opposite fields allow the beam energy to be measured as a function of the induced horizontal displacement @xmath12 given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the total bend length and the deflection angle @xmath4 is small ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrometer ] ) .",
    "the inclination of the beam trajectory through the bpms is then minimised and , by mounting the mid - chicane bpms on high precision movers , they could be translated to the beam location in the case of large induced offsets .",
    "the precision and accuracy of the measured offset @xmath12 contributes directly to the uncertainty of the final energy measurement . the current baseline spectrometer design  @xcite implements a @xmath15 deflection . an offset measurement",
    "to better than @xmath16 is therefore required to achieve the necessary energy resolution . however",
    ", a bpm system with better performance would allow a smaller deflection and , therefore , reduce the emittance growth due to synchrotron radiation .",
    "in addition , the system has to be stable to the level of @xmath16 over multiple hours to avoid extensive recalibration and consequent loss of luminosity .",
    "the operation and stability of a long baseline bpm system in the proposed spectrometer is of interest in several other fields .",
    "for example , the beam position in the ilc linacs must be measured with a resolution of @xmath17 for the orbit correction and emittance preservation .",
    "high resolution bpms are also required throughout the beam delivery system ( bds ) .",
    "current test facilities and modern linac based light sources are also demanding significantly better performance from their bpm systems .",
    "most notably , the atf2 @xcite facility at kek , designed to test the final focus optics for the ilc , not only requires resolutions of @xmath18 for the extraction line bpms but good stability and ease of use of the entire monitoring system .    in the framework of the t-474 test beam experiment @xcite in end station a ( esa ) at the stanford linear accelerator center ( slac )",
    ", we installed several bpm stations in the @xmath19 available drift space .",
    "the aim of three running periods in 2006 was to commission and optimise these bpms and study their resolution and stability .",
    "the principal results of these runs are discussed below .",
    "slac s accelerator and beam transport system for delivering high energy electron beams are depicted in figure  [ fig : slac_layout ] .",
    "a high intensity electron beam is produced by a thermionic gun , bunched and pre - accelerated in the first sections of the linac to @xmath20 .",
    "the bunches are then kicked by a pulsed magnet into the linac - to - ring transfer line and then transported to the electron north damping ring ( dr ) , where they are stored for @xmath21 to reduce the beam emittance .",
    "the ring - to - linac transfer line transports the bunches back from the dr and a pulsed magnet kicks them into the linac at sector 2 . the beam is subsequently accelerated to @xmath22 . at the end of the linac it is then transported from the beam switch yard ( bsy ) through a @xmath23 bending section into the a - line on its way to end station a. esa test beams operate with single bunches at @xmath24 parasitically to pep - ii operation .",
    "the esa is currently the highest energy test beam facility available , with its other beam parameters , listed in table  [ table : beam_comparison ] , similar to those for the ilc .",
    ".[table : beam_comparison ] beam parameters at esa and as proposed for the ilc  @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the main factors contributing to the resolution are electronic noise , digitiser errors and mechanical motion . to estimate the combined rf electronics and digitiser contributions , we ran the ddc algorithm over waveforms that did not contain beam data ( i.e. that contained only noise ) . dividing the mean of these results by the mean reference amplitude for each bpm and then multiplying by the calibration scale , gave us the predicted resolutions also shown in table  [ table : resol_table ] .",
    "the measured resolutions for bpms 1 - 2 and 9 - 11 are in reasonable agreement with those predicted indicating that the performance of these bpms is limited by the combined electronic and digitisation errors .",
    "the resolution for bpms 3 - 5 is significantly worse than what is predicted but is in reasonable agreement with the amount of vibration recorded by the interferometer ( see table  [ table : zygo_motion ] ) thus indicating that the resolution of these bpms is limited by mechanical motion . in order to remove this effect , we included the interferometer data in the matrix analysis as additional variables in equation  [ eq : resol_sum ]",
    "this addition improved the resolution measurement from @xmath25 to @xmath26 ( taking into account the geometric factor ) , which is equivalent to the removal of @xmath27 of mechanical vibration .",
    "this is only half of the non - rigid body motion recorded by the interferometer .",
    "high rate ( @xmath28 ) interferometer data indicated that the horizontal vibrational power spectrum peaked between @xmath29 ( see figure  [ fig : zygo_power ] ) .",
    "the latency between interferometer and bpm data arrival acquisition time is of the same order so not all of the mechanical motion could be removed .",
    "we plan to remedy this deficiency in future runs .",
    "we took several corrector and mover calibration scans over the course of the dedicated 18 hours of operation in order to study the stability of the calibration coefficients .",
    "as the parameters of the system vary over time , these coefficients maintain their validity only for a limited period , after which a recalibration is necessary .",
    "understanding of these effects is important for long term stable operation of the bpm system in the spectrometer .",
    "the variation of the calibration constants over the 18 hour running period is shown in figures  [ fig : full_cal_stab_iq ] and  [ fig : full_cal_stab_scale ] .",
    "the @xmath30 phase variation is small in all the bpms except for @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the large phase change in bpm @xmath31 was due to a small change in the digitiser trigger time relative to the beam arrival time .",
    "other bpms are less less sensitive to trigger fluctuations .",
    "as mentioned in section  [ sect : cavity_specs ] however , bpm @xmath31 had significant cross - coupling from the vertical mode which resulted in the measured phase being time - dependent .",
    "this sensitivity produced a large change in @xmath30 phase during the first calibration run and so this calibration for bpm @xmath31 was not used .",
    "the large changes in both @xmath30 phase and scale for bpm @xmath32 are the result of the perturbation already discussed in section  [ sect : freq_decay ] .",
    "though a new frequency was used for this section of the run , there is still some residual change .",
    "consequently , we used a separate calibration ( frequencies , @xmath30 phase and scale ) for this bpm from the time of the perturbation onwards .",
    "apart from those exceptions noted above , the @xmath30 phase for most bpms indicated a drift of about @xmath33 with no significant difference between the mover and corrector calibration .",
    "the scale variation for the bpms calibrated using the correctors was large despite the corrections of equation  [ eq : scaleadjust ] .",
    "in the @xmath12 direction , these variations were consistent with the statistical error ( about @xmath34 ) . in the @xmath35 direction",
    "the variation was larger than could be accounted for from beam jitter alone .",
    "the scale variations were anti - correlated for the first and third stations which suggested there was a angular variation during the corrector scans with the pivot point somewhere between these bpm stations .",
    "since only bpm 4 was equipped with a mover system , it was only possible to remove offset drifts , not angle drifts , using equation  [ eq : scaleadjust ] . to measure the slope drift during a calibration run",
    ", we used the measured @xmath35 positions of bpms 9 - 11 and bpms 1 and 2 to calculate the overall slope of the beam and found changes of up to @xmath36 . over the @xmath37 of beam line between the central bpm station ( 3 - 5 ) and the outer bpm stations ,",
    "this leads to a change of @xmath38 during a calibration step , introducing a change in scale of @xmath39 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the @xmath35 scale variation observed .",
    "the @xmath40 scale variations observed in the mover calibrations appear to be correlated to the temperature of the electronics racks ( see figure  [ fig : esa_temps ] ) . to further test whether environmental effects were behind the gain variations in the electronics",
    ", we applied a constant cw tone to the electronics for both the dipole and reference cavities and tracked drifts in relative amplitudes over the course of several hours .",
    "a variation of similar magnitude was found from these tests .    as the variation in @xmath30 phase was small and",
    "the large scale changes seen in the corrector calibrations seem to be caused by the beam drifts rather than electronics drifts , we averaged the coefficients obtained from the separate calibrations and used the mean values for the entire 18 hour run . the only exceptions to this were bpm @xmath31 in which the first calibration was removed from the average and bpm @xmath32 where two calibrations were used , one computed from calibrations before the mechanical perturbation and the other from after it .",
    "we investigated the stability of the bpm system over both short and long periods of operation . in both cases",
    "the calibration was refined using the svd over the first 1000-event block of the data .",
    "the 1 hour data shown in figure  [ fig : full_stab_short ] is a zoom into the last hour of the 18 hour run ( figure  [ fig : full_stab_long ] ) after recomputing the svd coefficients .",
    "we had to select the periods of stable data - taking excluding the data taken during the machine tuning , big energy jumps due to klystron failure etc . as well as the calibration data .",
    "in addition , due to the perturbation of bpm @xmath32 , the svd coefficients for bpms 9 - 11 were recomputed .    a 100  nm stability of bpms  9 - 11 , 500  nm of bpms  3 - 5 and micron stability of the full system",
    "are observed over one hour of operation .",
    "the limiting factor for the system s stability is the stability of bpms  1 and 2 , the electronics for which was exposed to large temperature variations .",
    "for all the bpm stations , the rms of the residual does not show any significant change with time over the course of the 18 hour run .",
    "in contrast , the mean residual experiences large variations , especially for bpms  1 and 2 , and therefore for the linked system as well .",
    "we considered the most likely source of these drifts to be gain variations in the electronics .",
    "this is supported by figure [ fig : res_vs_temp ] where we show the bpm  4 mean residual versus electronics temperature for events in which the beam position in bpm  4 was within @xmath41 from the mean position over the course of the 18 hour run .",
    "though there is a change in behaviour at temperatures above @xmath42c , below this value a significant correlation is seen .    to estimate the behaviour of a triplet of bpms",
    "when subject to changes in scale , we simulated three bpms with offsets typical in our system and a beam orbit experiencing typical beam jitter and drifts .",
    "a scale simulated scale drift of @xmath43 was implemented , similar in size to the effects seen in the experiment .",
    "we looked at two scenarios : only the central bpm s scale drifting only ( see figure  [ fig : sim_results]a ) and all three bpm scales drifting by the same amount and in the same direction ( see figure  [ fig : sim_results]b ) . in the first case ,",
    "both the rms value and the mean of the apparent beam residual increased gradually , while in the second simulation the rms value remained almost the same , while the offset increased gradually .",
    "the second case is consistent with the effects observed in our system : the physical offsets of the bpms with respect to each other reconstructed by temperature - dependent gains , resulting in observed changes in the reconstructed offsets .",
    "we tried improving our stability studies for the central bpm station including the interferometer data into svd computations . unfortunately",
    "this effort failed as the drifts over long periods of time observed in the interferometer seem to be caused by the thermal expansion of the supporting aluminium table and the change of the refractive index of the air rather than the actual mechanical motion .",
    "we noticed that the residual shows some correlation with the position for low amplitude signals when the beam is close to the cavity centre ( see figure  [ fig : corr2 ] ) , which can be caused by contributions from other cavity modes .",
    "this effect is small , but may contribute to the observed main residual variation .",
    "the drifts seen in the linked system seemed to be dominated by the scale changes .",
    "however , over the long baseline , it is possible that variations in energy combined with the earth s magnetic field produce a similar effect .",
    "to check this the energy of the beam was changed from @xmath44 to @xmath45 in five steps .",
    "this scan was tracked by the system as a change of the linked system mean residual ( figure [ fig : energy_dep ] ) .",
    "using a set of flux gate magnetometers , we measured the stray magnetic fields present around the beam line . using the measured fields ,",
    "a change in position of @xmath46 in @xmath12 and @xmath47 in @xmath35 is predicted for the @xmath48 energy change . we measured a change of @xmath49 in @xmath12 with no significant change in @xmath35 observed ( see figure  [ fig : energy_dep ] ) which is in good agreement with the prediction .",
    "the energy variation over the 18 hour run was @xmath50 and so the drifts seen over this time period were not consistent with a change in energy .",
    "we have successfully commissioned eight cavity bpms of differing designs and properties divided into three bpm stations in the end station a beamline at slac .",
    "the first bpm station consisted of two rectangular cavity bpms originally designed for use in the a - line .",
    "they demonstrated resolutions in @xmath12 and @xmath35 of @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively and were stable to @xmath53 over one hour while drifting by @xmath54 over 18 hours of operation .",
    "the resolution was limited by digitiser errors and noise .",
    "the drifts can be explained by the changes of electronics gains .",
    "the second bpm station consisted of three prototype ilc linac cylindrical bpms with the central bpm mounted on a dual - axis mover .",
    "these demonstrated resolutions of @xmath25 in @xmath12 and @xmath55 in @xmath35 .",
    "mechanical motion was found to dominate the resolution .",
    "these bpms were stable to @xmath56 over a period of 1 hour and @xmath57 over a period of 18 hours .",
    "the stability was influenced by low amplitude effects and mechanical vibration on short time scales and scale changes of @xmath58 magnitude over long time scales .",
    "the final bpm station in the beamline consisted of three rectangular cavity bpms , originally designed for use in the slac linac .",
    "they demonstrated resolutions of @xmath59 in @xmath12 and @xmath60 in @xmath35 with a stability of @xmath61 over the one hour period .",
    "long term stability of this station could only be measured over 10 hours due to a perturbation that altered the calibration of bpm @xmath32 . however , over these 10 hours , the triplet achieved a stability of @xmath62 in @xmath12 and @xmath63 in @xmath35 .",
    "as with bpms 3 - 5 , we think the stability was limited by low amplitude effects and scale drifts , but there was no information on the mechanical motion available for this triplet .    when combining all the bpm stations to measure the precision of the orbit reconstruction over the whole baseline , a resolution of @xmath64 in @xmath12 and @xmath65 in @xmath35 was achieved .",
    "the system was stable at the micron level over the course of one hour .",
    "the long term stability was affected by relative scale drifts across all the bpms therefore drifts of the order of @xmath54 were observed over 18 hours of operation .    in order to improve the system we had in 2006 and",
    "be able to perform full tests of a magnetic spectrometer prototype , we have added several upgrades to the beamline and bpm systems .",
    "four steel core dipole magnets have been installed to form the magnetic chicane with bpms 3 and 5 now measuring the incoming beam position , bpms 9 - 11 measuring the outgoing beam position and bpm 4 having been moved to measure the beam position at the mid - chicane location . to improve the stability of the bpms",
    ", we have added a periodic sine wave calibration tone .",
    "this is applied through the bpm electronics at a rate of @xmath66 and allows continuous gain and phase monitoring .",
    "this should allow us to track calibration changes online and correct for any variation .",
    "the interferometer has been extended to measure mechanical drifts between the new incoming bpm station ( bpms 3 and 5 ) and the mid - chicane bpm .",
    "helmholtz coils have been installed to quickly dither the beam and therefore reduce the dependence of the calibration procedure on beam drifts .",
    "we have commissioned these upgrades during 2007 and are planning to continue in 2008 , so we will report on the results in our next publication .",
