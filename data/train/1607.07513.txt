    "feshbach resonance @xcite is a powerful tool for the control of interaction between ultracold atoms @xcite . in ultracold gases of alkali atoms the magnetic feshbach resonances",
    "are widely used for the tuning of @xmath2-wave scattering lengths @xcite . for the gases of ultracold alkali - earth ( like ) atoms , recently we found a new type of feshbach resonance , i.e. , the orbital feshbach resonance ( ofr ) @xcite . with the help of ofr , one can precisely control the @xmath2-wave scattering length between two fermionic alkali - earth ( like ) atoms in @xmath3 and @xmath4 electronic orbital states with different nuclear spin , by changing the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "ofr has been experimentally observed in the ultracold gases of @xmath0yb atoms @xcite .",
    "it is also shown that using the ultracold gases of alkali - earth ( like ) atoms with ofr one can study several interesting problems , including the kondo effect , the strong - interacting ultracold fermi gases with narrow feshbach resonance and the leggett mode , _ et .",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "when the ofr of @xmath0yb atoms occurs , the energy gap between the open and the closed channel is about @xmath5hz .",
    "it is by two orders of magnitude smaller than the characteristic energy of the inter - atom interaction ( i.e. , the van der waals energy ) , which is of the order of @xmath6hz @xcite . as a result",
    ", a simple zero - range two - channel huang - yang pseudopotential can be used as an approximation for the inter - atom interaction @xcite . in this model , the two - body interaction is described by two parameters , i.e. , the scattering lengths @xmath7 for the two independent scattering channels @xmath8 which will be defined below .",
    "it is estimated that for @xmath0yb atoms the quantitative precision of the ofr point given by the two - channel huang - yang pseudopotential is about @xmath9 @xcite .    to obtain more accurate results",
    ", one needs to take into account the effects from the finite range van der waals interaction potential . to this end",
    ", one can numerically solve the multi - channel schr@xmath1dinger equation with a model interaction potential which behaves as a van der waals potential in the long - range limit ( _ e.g. , _ the lenard - jones potential ) @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there is also an analytical approach for the multi - channel low - energy two - body problem with van der waals potential , i.e. , the multi - channel quantum defect theory ( mqdt ) @xcite which is based on the analytical solution of the single - channel schr@xmath1dinger equation with van der waals potential @xcite . in ultracold atomic gas physics ,",
    "this mqdt approach was originally developed for alkali atoms .",
    "previous research for these systems shows that when the inter - channel energy gap is much smaller than the van der waals energy , the result given by the mqdt is quantitatively very accurate @xcite .",
    "thus , this approach is also applicable for the ultracold alkali earth ( like ) atoms with an ofr with small energy gaps between the open and the closed channels , _",
    "e.g. _ , the ultracold @xmath0yb atoms .    in this paper ,",
    "using the mqdt we solve the low - energy two - body problems for alkali earth ( like ) atoms with an ofr .",
    "we derive the analytical expressions of the two - atom scattering length and effective range ( eqs .",
    "( [ as ] ) and ( [ asreff ] ) ) , as well as the algebraic equation satisfied by the binding energy of two - body bound state ( eq . ( [ eb ] ) ) .",
    "all the results are expressed in terms of the scattering length @xmath7 as well as the characteristic length @xmath10 of the van der waals potential .",
    "our results show that the ofr for @xmath11 atoms is a narrow resonance@xcite . using these results",
    "we further investigate the clock - transition spectrum of these systems , which can be used for the experimental measurement of the binding energy .",
