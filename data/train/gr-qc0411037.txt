    "in 1893 and 1897 lodge argued that a device using electromagnetic fields should in principle be able to detect angular acceleration by the interference of light .",
    "sixteen years later sagnac @xcite observed such an effect and realised the potential for light interferometers as accelerometers .",
    "the continued development of such instruments and their careful exploitation by michelson and others was pivotal in the establishment of our current world view of classical physics .",
    "sagnac recognised that his observations could open up new avenues in the development of accelerometers , an insight that has been dramatically verified . today",
    "the ring - laser is a cornerstone of most inertial guidance systems and optoelectronics is the backbone of the communications industry ( see @xcite for historical accounts of ring - laser development ) .",
    "the basic principles leading to the sagnac effect are well understood in broad outline . as with all interferometers , a guided wave phenomenon ( such as that experienced by electromagnetic fields in a wave guide ) is used to distinguish different propagation paths in spacetime .",
    "the traditional electromagnetic `` passive '' type of sagnac interferometer involves splitting a light beam into two coherent components , forcing them to travel different paths in spacetime to an event where they combine to produce an interference pattern .",
    "the nature of the interference fringes can then be correlated with the difference in the optical paths .",
    "in such a device the frequency of the light employed is controlled externally and the circuits in spacetime are often determined by mirrors or continuous dielectric fibres .    with the discovery of the laser it was found that the electromagnetic modes of a closed tubular cavity containing an active lasing medium ( excited initially by an external rf field ) could be made to produce an interference pattern that varied with the state of rotation of the whole apparatus .",
    "such an instrument has been labelled an `` active '' device to distinguish it from the traditional passive sagnac interferometer .",
    "certain modes of a non - rotating cavity can be made to form standing waves .",
    "however , the co- and counter - propagating modes in a rotating lasing cavity acquire different resonant frequencies leading to a beat - frequency as observed by an on - board probe . in 1963",
    "sperry - rand recognised that the active ring - laser could be used as an inertial - guidance device . today",
    "such miniturised interferometers are used routinely in civil and military applications .    considerable increase in sensitivity",
    "can be achieved using larger ring - lasers .",
    "insulated from thermal and seismic noise , sensitivities of @xmath0 are routinely obtained in the ug1 sagnac interferometer housed in the cashmere cavern in christchurch , new zealand . with an effective area of @xmath1 and perimeter",
    "@xmath2 it operates with a he - ne laser at @xmath3 and an intracavity power of @xmath4 at each mirror .",
    "high resolution can be achieved by pattern matching to periodic variation of the sagnac frequency induced by rotation of the earth . using matching based on geophysical modelling , detection of lunar perturbations of the earth s rotation and the amplitudes of the oppolzer modes",
    "have recently been reported in @xcite .",
    "the instantaneous direction of the earth s rotation axis has been measured to a precision of @xmath5 part in @xmath6 when averaged over a time interval of several hours .",
    "the enhanced sensitivity of such large ring - lasers owes much to the significant improvement of mirror design in recent years .",
    "it is imperative for the maintenance of a sagnac beat signal that pollution of the resonant state by competing modes is inhibited .",
    "this requires considerable engineering skill , the use of thermally inert materials and mirrors that can maintain the dominant cavity resonant mode over long periods of time .    with such advances in technology",
    "it is natural to seek the sensitivities that are necessary to discriminate the effects of non - newtonian gravitation on the behaviour of light @xcite .",
    "the most important of these is the gravito - magnetic field of the rotating earth , predicted by einstein s description of gravitation .",
    "however , even crude estimates of the effects of terrestrial gravito - magnetism show that a number of competing effects that may modify the classical sagnac effect ( due to the rotation of the apparatus ) need careful consideration .",
    "such effects are often dependent on the structure of the interferometer and so invite one to contemplate alternative designs . although , in general , one expects that the sensitivity of an active ring - laser will increase with its spatial dimensions one may also enquire about the dependence of sensitivity on its geometry and spatial shape . in order to discriminate gravito - magnetic effects",
    "it then becomes necessary to understand in some detail how the geometry and shape of the interferometer affect the resonant mode structure of the cavity . in this way",
    "one can hope to discriminate between a number of features that compete to modify the classical sagnac frequency .",
    "the effect of gravitation on the sagnac beat frequency is usually discussed in terms of the high frequency ray - optic description of light . in this way",
    "one can simply relate the interference of co- and counter - propagating electromagnetic modes to the proper time difference between events that terminate their ray histories in spacetime @xcite .",
    "while such an analysis can give valuable insights into the leading terms in an asymptotic expansion in the lasing frequency it can not address the effects due to the vector nature of the electromagnetic modes and the effects of the infinity of competing modes possessed by the lasing cavity .",
    "an exact analysis of the wave nature of light in an active sagnac cavity is a non - trivial mathematical problem that has to our knowledge never been fully considered .",
    "the problem is complicated by the fact that the harmonic electromagnetic modes rarely split into simpler transverse electric ( te ) and transverse magnetic ( tm ) modes that greatly simplify the analysis in most simply - connected axially symmetric cavity geometries .",
    "such a separation relies on a number of factors such as the shape of the entire cavity in space , the homogeneity of the lasing medium , the nature of the acceleration of the cavity and the presence of even a weak non - newtonian gravitational field .",
    "in order to accommodate these complexities a viable approximation is mandatory . here",
    "the problem is approached in terms of an expansion scheme determined by scales related to the geometry of the cavity .",
    "thus slender cavities are considered where the ratio of the transverse dimension to the cavity length is small .",
    "such cavities will be called `` wavetubes '' . in order to confidently predict near - earth general relativistic contributions to the active sagnac beat frequency a careful electromagnetic mode analysis of the cavity",
    "must be considered .",
    "this can be done in terms of the covariant maxwell equations @xcite for moving media @xcite on a background spacetime determined by einstein s equations for gravitation .",
    "the procedure will exploit a local system of coordinates adapted to the geometry of a wavetube .",
    "such a wavetube can be characterised in terms of the locus in space of the centre of each of its transverse cross - sections .",
    "this locus is regarded as a closed space curve with possible non - zero frenet torsion and curvature .",
    "the approximation scheme will be developed for a wavetube with central locus having local curvature departing slightly from that of a fixed plane circle .    in sections 2 and 3",
    "it is shown how to construct te and tm type solutions to the covariant maxwell equations for a particular class of coframes .",
    "these include the fields in rotating cavities containing a homogenous , isotropic and dispersionless medium in the presence of terrestrial gravito - magnetism . the language of exterior differential forms is used throughout since it offers the most succinct formulation for the field equations and makes clear the role of the spacetime metric and local coframe that feature in the subsequent computational scheme .",
    "the relation to the inertial 3-d formulation can be found in @xcite and references therein . in section 4 a particular coordinate system",
    "is introduced that , together with a particular frenet frame , encodes the geometry of the wavetube and permits one to introduce dimensionless parameters that control the nature of the approximation scheme . in these coordinates differences between non - inertial motion and gravito - magnetic effects",
    "are made explicit in sections 5.1 and 5.2 .",
    "a complete mode analysis of the rotating wavetube is given in section 6 and the effects of multi - mode excitation and the description of sagnac beats is explored in section 7 . in particular attention",
    "is drawn to the effects of non - planarity of the wavetube on the beat frequency by reference to a particular geometry generated by the structure of a torus - knot .",
    "to accommodate the ideas above it is first shown how a class of spacetime metrics that admit local orthonormal coframes with particular properties are sufficient to construct te and tm type electromagnetic modes relative to such a coframe .",
    "the language of exterior forms is used throughout range over the integers @xmath7 , indices in the middle of the latin alphabet @xmath8 range over the integers @xmath9 and greek indices @xmath10 range over @xmath11 .",
    "expressions involving repeated indices imply use of the einstein summation convention . ]",
    "since this greatly facilitates the discussion and leads in a direct manner to an explicit construction of the fields below .",
    "the hollow wavetube is supposed to be constructed of a perfectly conducting material which in this section contains no lasing medium .",
    "let @xmath12 be a spacetime and let @xmath13 be a local orthonormal coframe with respect to the metric tensor @xmath14 with dual frame @xmath15 , @xmath16 and orientation ( volume form ) defined by the hodge map @xmath17 with @xmath18 the inverse metric tensor @xmath19 is @xmath20 define the split of the cotangent space @xmath21 with @xmath22 spanned by @xmath23 and @xmath24 spanned by @xmath25 at @xmath26 .",
