    "over the past two decades , redshift surveys of the nearby universe ( geller & huchra 1989 ; fairall et al .",
    "1990 ) have mapped out a highly inhomogeneous galaxy distribution , with large `` voids '' bounded by sheetlike superclusters .",
    "a goal of studies of the content of these voids ( sanduleak & pesch 1987 ; szomuru et al .",
    "1994 ; weinberg et al . 1991 ; strauss & huchra 1988 ) is to understand how galaxy formation and subsequent interactions fit into a cosmological framework . with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) , we have undertaken a spectral search for low - redshift neutral hydrogen ( ly@xmath0 ) absorption clouds along sightlines to bright quasars behind well - mapped voids and superclusters . in our earlier work from cycle 2 ( stocke et al .",
    "1995 , hereafter paper i ) , on the first three sightlines , we detected 8 definite ly@xmath0absorption lines , ranging in equivalent width from 26 to 240 m .",
    "seven of these absorbers were located in supercluster galaxy structures .",
    "one absorber , in the sightline toward mrk  501 , was located in a void , more than 5.9 mpc from the nearest bright galaxy .",
    "this discovery demonstrated that the voids are not entirely empty of gaseous matter , but the statistics were low .",
    "in fact , a number of h  i galaxies , iras galaxies , and emission - line galaxies have been found within the boundaries of the bootes void ( tifft et al .",
    "1986 ; weistrop & downes 1988 ; dey , strauss , & huchra 1990 ; szomoru et al .",
    "1993 ) , the pegasus void ( fairall et al .",
    "1990 ) , and the pisces - perseus void ( henning 1992 ) . however , the filamentary structure of galaxies inside the bootes and pegasus voids is similar to that found in the voids between the local supercluster and the `` great wall '' in the cfa survey ( huchra et al .",
    "1993 ; see also our figure 1 ) . because the total extent of the voids is somewhat uncertain at the distance of bootes",
    ", we chose our targets toward more local voids , with better - mapped galaxy distributions .",
    "for example , one ly@xmath0cloud in the direction of mrk  501 reported in paper i is found within a filamentary structure of galaxies separating two large voids whose total size is comparable to the bootes void .    in this paper , we report the results of additional hst cycle 4 observations of i  zw  1 and mrk  421 . toward i  zw  1 , we are now able to upgrade a `` probable '' void absorber to `` definite '' status , and we have detected another ly@xmath0absorber in a void toward the fourth target , mrk 421 .",
    "we update the distribution of ly@xmath0clouds toward all four sightlines , analyze the physical parameters of these ly@xmath0clouds , and make an estimate of their contribution to the baryonic mass density of the universe .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of a possible connection of ly@xmath0clouds with dwarf galaxies and the implications of our detections for cosmology and galaxy formation .",
    "the spectra of our first three targets ( mrk  501 , mrk  335 , i  zw  1 ) were taken with the goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) aboard the hst , using the g160 m grating with pre - costar optics . these data and their interpretation are discussed in detail by stocke et al .",
    "( 1995 , hereafter paper i ) . since that paper ,",
    "we have re - observed i  zw  1 ( 6.53 hr on 6 february 1995 ) and obtained a new spectrum ( 4.35 hr on 1 february 1995 ) on our fourth target , mrk 421 .",
    "i  zw  1 ( 0050 + 1225 ) is a bright quasar ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 km  s@xmath1 ) located at @xmath9 and @xmath10 , while mrk 421 is a bright bl lac object ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 km  s@xmath1 ) located at @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "both observations used the g160 m grating and the costar enhancement of the ghrs optics to obtain 40 km  s@xmath1resolution in the interval 1222  1259  .",
    "these wavelengths correspond to redshifted velocities @xmath15 km  s@xmath1extending roughly from the local supercluster to the `` great wall '' ( geller & huchra 1989 ) . in this paper we assume a hubble constant @xmath16 . the four qso targets ( mrk  501 , mrk  335 , i  zw  1 , and mrk  421 ) were chosen because of their brightness ( @xmath17 ) and their location behind well - studied galaxy distributions with foreground voids considerably emptier than the bootes void ( sanduleak & pesch 1987 ; szomoru et al .",
    "1994 ; weinberg et al . 1991",
    "; strauss & huchra 1988 ) .",
    "our data reduction was identical to that in paper i. all spectra were taken through the @xmath18 large science aperture using the standard quarter - diode sub - stepping pattern to yield pixels of 0.018   in the fp - split mode .",
    "we reduced our spectra with the stsdas spectral reduction package within iraf , and the wavelength scale was determined by assuming that the galactic s  ii absorption features at 1250.584   and 1253.811   lie at zero velocity in the local standard of rest ( lsr ) .",
    "the statistical significance of the absorption features was determined from measured noise in the continuum and from uncertainties in continuum placement .",
    "the status of `` definite '' absorber was given to features greater than @xmath19 significance ; `` probable '' detections were those of 34 @xmath20 significance .    in figure 1",
    "we show the co - added spectrum of i  zw  1 ( 6.53 hrs of new data added to 7.21 hrs of previous data taken on 8 september 1993 ) .",
    "we have definite detections of five spectral features : three ly@xmath0lines and two galactic s  ii absorbers . by combining the two spectra",
    ", we confirm our previous definite detections of ly@xmath0absorbers at heliocentric velocities @xmath21 km  s@xmath1and @xmath22 km  s@xmath1 , and we upgrade the `` probable '' detection of the @xmath23 km  s@xmath1absorber to definite status .",
    "the new spectrum of mrk  421 is shown in figure 2 .",
    "we detect a single ly@xmath0absorber at high significance at velocity @xmath24 km  s@xmath1and two galactic s  ii lines .",
    "table 1 lists the wavelengths , heliocentric velocities , equivalent widths , and significances of the features .",
    "the two new absorbers toward i  zw  1 and mrk  421 both lie within voids , confirming our previous discovery of ly@xmath0clouds in voids .",
    "the galaxy distributions are shown in figure 3 , based on the cfa merged galaxy redshift catalog ( huchra et al .",
    "because the mrk  501 sightline lies near the eastern edge of the cfa survey , we obtained 20 additional redshifts at ra greater than 17 hr from the ongoing survey to verify that the voids in front of mrk  501 extend well beyond 17 hr ( huchra , private communication ) .",
    "the galaxy distributions toward mrk  501 and mrk  421 are shown at somewhat higher declinations ( @xmath25 ) than those usually displayed by the cfa group ( delapparent , geller , & huchra 1986 ; peebles 1993 ) .",
    "these sightlines traverse comparable portions of `` supercluster '' and `` void '' , determined according to the `` wavelet analysis '' method ( slezak , de lapparent , & bijaoui 1993 ) .",
    "we believe that our identifications of void and supercluster regions are accurate to @xmath26 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "we now compare our new results and those of paper i and update the statistics based on the new data . over the four sightlines , the pathlength ( @xmath27 ) through voids totals 16,000 km  s@xmath1 , while that through superclusters totals 18,000 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "we have now detected a total of 10 definite ly@xmath0absorption lines at a significance above @xmath19 ( table 2 ) .",
    "the ly@xmath0equivalent widths detected with the ghrs range from 26 to 240 m , corresponding to column densities n(h  i ) between @xmath2 and @xmath28 @xmath3 for doppler parameter @xmath29 km  s@xmath30 .",
    "the frequency of absorbers is approximately one every 3400 km  s@xmath1of pathlength , above @xmath2 @xmath3 column density , comparable to that estimated from ghrs observations of other agn ( weymann 1993 ; savage , sembach , & lu 1995 ) .",
    "these numbers are approximate , however , since proper treatments of the ghrs sensitivity function and the h  i column density distribution have not yet been performed .",
    "three clouds lie within voids ( one each toward mrk  501 , i  zw  1 , and mrk  421 ) and seven are associated with supercluster walls , including three in the local supercluster . expressed as heliocentric velocities , the three definite void absorbers lie at 3046 km  s@xmath1toward mrk  421 , at 7740 km  s@xmath1toward mrk  501 , and at 2861 km  s@xmath1toward i  zw  1 .",
    "the nearest known galaxies lie 4.3 , 5.9 , and 1.7 @xmath31 mpc away from these clouds , respectively ( table 2 ) . in the case of absorber b toward i  zw  1 , the nearest galaxy ( a0054 + 1005 at @xmath32 km  s@xmath1and @xmath33 mpc distance ) is likely to be part of the local supercluster .",
    "we had classified the region surrounding the 2861 km  s@xmath1absorber as a void prior to the hst / ghrs observations , and we believe that this absorber lies just beyond the local supercluster in that direction .",
    "the distances to other bright galaxy neighbors are considerably larger . at somewhat lower significance ( 34 @xmath20 )",
    "we find one more probable ly@xmath0absorber at 6000 km  s@xmath1which also lies in a void toward mrk  501 .",
    "therefore , with combined pathlength 47% through voids and 53% through superclusters , we find that 3 of 10 definite ly@xmath0absorbers lie within voids .",
    "these statistics are small , and the addition of the fourth qso sightline has shifted the fraction of ly@xmath0absorbers within voids slightly higher than that ( 1 out of 8) quoted in paper i. according to binomial statistics for a uniform distribution of absorbers , the observed ( 3 out of 10 ) situation could occur with 15% chance probability ( 19% when one includes the 1 additional `` possible '' absorber which also lies in a void ) . therefore , the tendency of ly@xmath0clouds to lie in superclusters can not be stated as definitively as in paper i. the range of distances to nearest - neighbor bright galaxies for the three void absorbers ( 1.7  5.9@xmath31 mpc ) is comparable to that for the seven non - void absorbers ( 0.45  5.9@xmath31 mpc ) .",
    "however , the nearest neighbor to the possible void absorber toward mrk 501 lies @xmath34 mpc away , and the distribution of distances to the nearest galaxies to the void and non - void absorbers shows some differences inside and outside 1 mpc ( paper i ) . for example , four of the seven non - void absorbers have neighbor galaxies within 1 mpc . evidently the discovery of more absorbers toward agn behind well - mapped galaxy distributions is needed to settle the issue of how well ly@xmath0absorbers trace the large - scale structure of galaxies .",
    "these nearest bright galaxies are too far from the ly@xmath0clouds to be physically associated in most models .",
    "pencil - beam optical and 21-cm surveys of the area of sky surrounding mrk  501 find no galaxy at comparable redshift to the 7530 km  s@xmath1void absorption system within @xmath35 kpc with absolute magnitude @xmath36 and no object with h  i mass @xmath37 within 500 @xmath31 kpc ( paper i ) .",
    "thus , neither a faint optical galaxy nor a gas - rich galaxy is present close to this ly@xmath0cloud .",
    "however , as we shall suggest in the next section , it is probable that the low - redshift ly@xmath0absorbers may be associated with dwarf galaxies .",
    "we now derive the physical characteristics of the h  i clouds .",
    "if the clouds are exposed to metagalactic photoionizing radiation of specific intensity @xmath38 ergs  @xmath3 s@xmath30 sr@xmath30 hz@xmath39 at 912 and ( energy ) spectral index @xmath40 , the hydrogen ionization correction can be large , but derivable from the assumptions of photoionization equilibrium and cloud geometry .",
    "the void ly@xmath0lines toward mrk  501 , i  zw  1 , and mrk  421 have equivalent widths of 48 m , 65 m , and 92 m  respectively , corresponding to column densities n(h  i ) @xmath41 @xmath3 for doppler - broadening parameter @xmath29 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "other low - redshift ly@xmath0clouds have h  i columns up to @xmath28 @xmath3 . since the total mass of photoionized homogeneous ly@xmath0clouds is probably dominated by the upper end of the distribution , we will hereafter scale to a characteristic column density n(h  i ) = @xmath42  @xmath43 .    to make further progress , we need an estimate for the cloud sizes .",
    "however , unlike the situation with high - redshift ly@xmath0clouds , we lack definitive information on the size of the low-@xmath44 absorbers . from the absorber coincidences and anti - coincidences toward the double - quasar q1343 + 266a ,",
    "b at @xmath45 ( bechtold et al .",
    "1994 ; dinshaw et al .",
    "1994 ) the radii of ly@xmath0absorbers at @xmath46 have been estimated to lie in the range @xmath47 kpc , with a median value of @xmath48 kpc . at low redshift , no such measurements have been performed .",
    "sizes much smaller than 100 kpc would require unacceptably large space densities ( weymann 1993 ; maloney 1993 ) .",
    "the only physical information on low-@xmath44 cloud size comes from studies ( lanzetta et al .",
    "1995 ) of 46 galaxies in the fields of hst / fos ly@xmath0absorbers .",
    "each of five galaxies within @xmath49 kpc corresponds to a ly@xmath0absorber , whereas the frequency is only five of ten galaxies between @xmath49 and @xmath50 kpc and one of nine galaxies beyond @xmath50 kpc .",
    "lanzetta et al ( 1995 ) also found an anti - correlation between ly@xmath0equivalent width and ( ly@xmath0- galaxy ) impact parameter .",
    "as we showed in paper i , the trend for lower - column absorbers to have larger impact parameters does not appear to extend beyond 100200 kpc for the lower - column h  i clouds detected by hst / ghrs .",
    "taking all this evidence into account , we adopt a characteristic radius @xmath51 and carry along the scaling parameter @xmath52 to demonstrate the sensitivity of some quantities to this uncertain size .    the precise distribution of density in these ly@xmath0clouds is uncertain , and mass estimates based on photoionization corrections are imprecise . to obtain a first - order estimate",

    "if the mean column density is taken to be n(h  i ) @xmath61 , then the total hydrogen density @xmath62 , neutral fraction @xmath63 , and cloud mass @xmath64 are , @xmath65^{-1/2 } \\ ; , \\\\ x_{hi } & = & ( 5.9 \\times 10^{-5})~ j_{-23}^{-1/2}~ t_{4.3}^{-0.363}~                n_{14}^{1/2 } ~r_{100}^{-1/2 } ~\\left [ \\frac{\\alpha_s+3}{4.5 }                \\right]^{1/2 } \\ ; , \\\\ m_{cl } & = & ( 7.4 \\times 10 ^ 8~m_{\\odot } ) ~j_{-23}^{1/2 } ~t_{4.3}^{0.363}~          n_{14}^{1/2 } ~r_{100}^{5/2 } ~\\left [ \\frac{\\alpha_s+3}{4.5 }           \\right]^{-1/2 } \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from the observed absorber frequency of one cloud with n(h  i ) @xmath66 @xmath3 every 3500 km  s@xmath1(weymann 1993 ) , one infers a redshift frequency @xmath67 .",
    "the local space density of the low - redshift ly@xmath0systems is therefore @xmath68 approximately 40 times that of bright galaxies , @xmath69 , with luminosity function @xmath70 .",
    "the recent cfa survey ( marzke , huchra , & geller 1994 ) gave values @xmath71 and @xmath72 , while other determinations ( sandage , binggeli , & tammann 1985 ; impey , bothun , & malin 1988 ) of @xmath73 find a faint - end slope @xmath74 or even steeper in the virgo cluster .",
    "however , statistics on the faint - end luminosity function are poor , and values of the slope ( @xmath75 ) and normalization ( @xmath76 ) trade off against one another . for example , marzke et al . ( 1994 ) noted a factor - of - three excess at the faint end , relative to their ( @xmath77 ) fit , and claimed that this may be due to sm - im dwarf galaxies with @xmath78 .",
    "we are now in a position to compare the space density of the ly@xmath0clouds to that of galactic consituents of the universe .",
    "the volume filling factor of the ly@xmath0clouds is @xmath79 if @xmath5 galaxies have a mass - to - light ratio ( persic & salucci 1992 ) of @xmath80 within the holmberg radius , the ly@xmath0cloud masses correspond to @xmath81 , where @xmath82 . for a faint - end slope @xmath83",
    ", we estimate that galaxies with @xmath84 have a space density @xmath85 , four times less than that estimated for ( @xmath86 kpc ) ly@xmath0absorbers .",
    "given the uncertainties in the luminosity function and ly@xmath0cloud size , these space densities are in fair agreement .",
    "they are also comparable to those of low - mass halos found in estimates using the press - schechter formalism and in recent numerical cdm simulations ( efstathiou 1995 ) , which predict a comoving space density @xmath87 mpc@xmath88 of halos with mass greater than @xmath89 .",
    "that particular simulation found @xmath90 at low masses , appropriate for hierarchical clustering models in which the power spectrum of mass fluctuations @xmath91 . an unanswered question from these simulations is the fraction of low - mass halos that undergo star formation at some epoch .",
    "many surveys of the faint end of the luminosity function ( sandage et al .",
    "1985 ; impey et al .",
    "1998 ; marzke et al .",
    "1994 ) suggest a large space density of dwarf galaxies , some of which are difficult to detect owing to their low surface brightness",
    ". the ly@xmath0absorbers could be the halos of the faint blue dwarf galaxies ( tyson 1988 ; cowie et al . 1988 ) that have faded by the present epoch ( babul & rees 1992 ; salpeter 1993 ) or low - mass gas clouds whose cores have not yet undergone significant star formation . our previous failure to detect any dwarf galaxies down to @xmath92 at the position of the void absorber toward mrk  501 ( stocke et al .",
    "1995 ) accentuates the need for deeper imaging of these fields in search of dwarf galaxies down to @xmath93 . in the only such search conducted thus far , rauch , weymann , & morris ( 1995 ) failed to find any galaxied with @xmath94 near the 3c  273 sight line , including low surface brightness objects with @xmath95 mag arcsec@xmath96 .",
    "optical and 21 cm searches for such dwarfs are possible only for very local ly@xmath0clouds , since many of the ly@xmath0clouds ( bahcall et al .",
    "1991 ; morris et al .",
    "1991 ) disovered by hst are too distant to set sensitive limits on the presence of dwarf galaxies .",
    "h  i ( 21-cm ) searches at @xmath97 km  s@xmath1are straightforward , but studies of more distant gas require increasingly large amounts of observing time .    similarly , spectra of the low-@xmath44 ly@xmath0clouds in the ultraviolet resonance lines of c  iv , c  iii , and c  ii could set useful limits on possible star formation . from equation ( 2 ) , the column density of carbon in all ion stages should be n(c ) @xmath98  @xmath99 at 0.01 solar metallicity . if 10% of the carbon is in c  iv , absorption lines at 1549   should be present at a very weak level ( 110 m  equivalent width )",
    ". lines from c  ii ( 1335  ) or c  iii ( 977  ) might set even better metallicity limits if carbon exists in lower ionization states owing to a less intense or softer radiation field .",
    "we can obtain an estimate of the fractional contribution , @xmath100 , of low - redshift ly@xmath0clouds to the critical ( closure ) density , @xmath101 , of the universe from equations ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) . the value , @xmath102^{-1/2 } \\ ; , \\ ] ] is comparable to that ( @xmath103 ) of optically - luminous matter ( peebles 1993 ) and is 15% of the total baryonic limit , @xmath104 , inferred ( walker et al .",
    "1991 ) from the constraints of big bang nucleosynthesis",
    ". thus , these clouds have overdensities @xmath105 with respect to the smooth baryonic background density , @xmath106 .",
    "we note that our estimates for the low - redshift absorbers are uncertain , since they depend on poorly known geometric parameters of the clouds .",
    "for example , we do not know the distributions of cloud size and n(h  i ) , assumed here to be constant at 100 kpc and @xmath28 @xmath3 respectively . we note that , while cloud mass scales as @xmath107 , the total mass density and value of @xmath108 are less sensitive ( @xmath109 ) to assumptions of cloud size .",
    "in addition , the distribution of matter within the low - redshift absorbers might also be inhomogeneous , either with a radial distribution of density or clumps .",
    "each of these distributions would accentuate , through recombinations , the regions with highest density .",
    "one could also relax the assumption of spherical clouds . by generalizing the spherical assumption to disk geometries , madau & shull ( 1996 ) showed that the value of @xmath108 is reduced by a factor @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the disk aspect ratio and @xmath112 is their viewing angle .",
    "so , for example , a ratio @xmath113 would reduce @xmath108 by a factor 2.2 .",
    "in the proto - galaxy scenario , the low-@xmath44 ly@xmath0clouds represent parcels of gas and dark matter that have recently ( @xmath114 ) turned around from the general hubble expansion and now have mean overdensities @xmath115 times that of the background igm . to be consistent with the frequency of absorbers , these parcels must have a space density comparable to that of dwarf galaxies .",
    "the hydrogen clouds around these galaxies may only recently have become detectable in ly@xmath0absorption because of the rapid drop in the ionizing radiation field at low redshift .",
    "whether these gaseous envelopes could retain their integrity following encounters with passing massive galaxies would depend on the distances of these galaxies and on the gas dynamical outcome of the encounter .",
    "no encounters may have occurred with the void absorbers toward mrk 501 and mrk 421 , since neighboring galaxies from the supercluster walls moving over 10 gyr with @xmath116 km  s@xmath1peculiar velocity would not be able to traverse the void .    in the faded dwarf galaxy scenario ( babul & rees 1992 ; efstathiou 1994 ) , the low - redshift clouds are the extended gaseous halos of the faint blue dwarf galaxies detected in deep imaging surveys .",
    "although we have modeled these objects as homogeneous spheres , it is likely that the cloud cores have collapsed and formed stars , whose winds and supernovae blow matter out into the extended ( 100 kpc ) envelopes required by the frequency , @xmath117 , of ly@xmath0absorbers .",
    "the fact that some ly@xmath0clouds reside in regions devoid of bright galaxies is consistent with the observed low amplitude of angular correlation found ( efstathiou et al .",
    "1991 ) for the faint blue galaxies .",
    "the scenario predicts that very low luminosity galaxies , similar to the local group dwarfs , should be found in deep ( b@xmath118 ) ground - based optical images near the low - redshift ly@xmath0clouds . in a deep imaging search for faint galaxies toward 3c  273 near the local ly@xmath0clouds in the virgo cluster , morris et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and rauch , weymann , & morris ( 1995 ) found no dwarf galaxies to impressively faint limits ( @xmath94 and limiting surface brightness levels of @xmath119 mag  arcsec@xmath96 ) .",
    "similarly sensitive searches are required for cloud sample .",
    "thus , h  i ( 21 cm ) observations and deep optical imaging are in progress ( carilli et al .",
    "1995 ) to search for accompanying faint galaxies .",
    "finally , it is worth speculating on possible dark - matter content .",
    "since the jeans mass , @xmath120 , safely exceeds the baryonic mass , the clouds are not gravitationally unstable . however , in order to bind them gravitationally , we require that @xmath121 , where the ratio of total matter to baryonic matter is @xmath122 thus , as in other large self - gravitating systems , the low - redshift ly@xmath0clouds could contain substantial amounts of dark matter , unless the clouds are quite large ( @xmath123 kpc ) as suggested for some clouds at higher redshift ( dinshaw et al . 1995 ) .",
    "since all baryonic matter has been included in the ionization correction ( equation [ 1 ] ) this dark matter would need to be non - baryonic .",
