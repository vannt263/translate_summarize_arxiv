    "one of the most interesting issues concerning high-@xmath6 cuprates is the competitive coexistence between superconductivity and charge / magnetic order .",
    "this problem dates back to the discovery , in 1988 @xcite , of a drop in @xmath6 at the commensurate doping @xmath4 = 0.125 in la@xmath7ba@xmath8cuo@xmath3 ( lbco ) , and found an explanation with the discovery of commensurate charge and spin order at 1/8 hole doping @xcite , in form of charge stripes separated by antiferromagnetic , neutral walls .",
    "it became then clear that static charge and spin ordering competes in cuprates with superconductivity and leads to its partial suppression .",
    "further studies on different members of the 214 family @xcite showed that , upon cooling , such ordering is preceded at a temperature called @xmath9 ( see table i ) by a structural transition from the usual low - temperature orthorhombic ( lto ) to a low - temperature tetragonal ( ltt ) phase , through a rotation of the oxygen octahedra surrounding the cu atoms .",
    "however , this well established landscape was deeply modified when inelastic neutron scattering @xcite and infrared spectroscopy @xcite found anomalies in the low - temperature response of the 214 compounds also at incommensurate doping , where no static superlattices were found by conventional diffraction .",
    "such features were attributed to fluctuating spin and charge ordering , and are similar to those produced by static ordering . in both cases , for example , an extra - drude peak appears in the far - infrared ( fir ) optical conductivity , which indicates charge localization , and damped spin excitations or `` paramagnons '' @xcite are detected by inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) .",
    "fluctuating charge order in cuprates seems then to coexist with , or even to favor , superconductivity , and the intriguing implications of this finding have been widely discussed in the literature ( for a review , see , _",
    "e. g. _ , ref . ) .",
    "= 8.6 cm    in an attempt to better understand the interplay between ordering phenomena and superconductivity , another member of the 214 family , la@xmath0eu@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 ( lesco ) has been investigated in recent years .",
    "therein , below @xmath4 = 0.17 no meissner effect can be detected @xcite , while clear indications of antiferromagnetic ( af ) order were found for @xmath10 0.014 by muon spin rotation @xcite .",
    "short - range magnetic order was detected in the same experiment for @xmath11 0.08 .",
    "evidence for stripe formation , with a doping - dependent wavevector , was provided by resonant x - ray diffraction below @xmath12 = 80 k at @xmath4 = 1/8 and below 65 k at @xmath4 = 0.15 @xcite . here also , commensurate order competes with superconductivity , as demonstrated by a recent pump - probe optical experiment .",
    "the stripes of lesco at 1/8 doping were destabilized by a mid - ir pumping of the cu - o stretching mode . by then probing in the terahertz range both the real and imaginary part of the optical conductivity",
    ", the authors observed that the superconducting state was restored with a strong increase in @xmath6 @xcite .    by using data in the literature and original dc transport measurements ( in particular the c - axis resistivity @xmath13 and its derivative @xmath14 )",
    "we could construct the phase diagram of la@xmath0eu@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 between @xmath4 = 0.08 and 0.20 , as shown in fig .",

    "optimum doping is achieved for @xmath4 = 0.16 , where static charge ordering disappears from the x - ray diffraction spectra . as a result of this phase diagram , in comparison with the other charge - ordered 214 compounds",
    ", lesco exhibits the largest separations among the structural , magnetic , and charge ordering transition temperatures ( see table [ temps ] ) .",
    "this will make easier , in the present optical study , to separate the effects of long - range charge order from those which can be ascribed to the other transitions , or simply to charge localization effects . even if lesco has been studied with different techniques for about fifteen years , to date its equilibrium optical properties",

    "this helps us to understand another observation , namely that @xmath5 for @xmath41 in fig .",
    "[ sigma]-c is much lower than for lsco at optimum doping @xcite .",

    "this is probably due to lack of data below 30 @xmath31 , caused by the small size of this crystal .",
    "both in the @xmath43 and @xmath44 samples , at variance with that at optimum doping , @xmath5 decreases at any @xmath45 for @xmath41 .",

    "the fit also distinguishes the @xmath46 phonon peaks of the 214 @xmath30 plane , increasingly shielded for increasing doping , and the broad mir band reproduced by the sum of two lorentzians .",
    "fir peaks at finite frequencies similar to those in fig .",
    "[ fit]-a and -b were observed in lnsco @xcite , underdoped lsco @xcite , and la@xmath20ba@xmath47sr@xmath48cuo@xmath3 ( lbsco ) @xcite , and attributed to charge localization and ordering , either static or dynamic .",
    "figure [ comparison ] proposes a comparison among the far - infrared conductivities of lesco ( present experiment ) , lnsco @xcite , and lbsco @xcite , at commensurate doping and low temperature .",
    "all of them show the fir peak , but the one in lesco is found at the highest frequency .",
    "consistently with this finding , in both lesco samples of fig . [ sigma ] with @xmath4 = 0.11 and 0.125 , the peak survives at remarkably high temperatures .",
    "they are also higher than all the transition temperatures reported in table i for @xmath4 = 0.125 and in the phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ phase_diag ] .",
    "therefore the charge carriers associated with the fir peak in these compounds are localized even in the absence of long - range order . for @xmath49 , the peak is approximately independent of temperature .",
    "for @xmath50 instead , it hardens considerably below the co transition at 80 k , indicating that it is such shift , not the appearance of the peak itself , which is related to long - range ordering .",
    "to better follow the process induced by co in lesco , we have plotted in fig .",
    "[ diff ] the variation of the optical conductivity between different temperatures and room temperature for both underdoped crystals in the far infrared .",
    "while at @xmath43 , as anticipated previously , there is no appreciable change in the whole temperature range , the sample with commensurate doping @xmath44 exhibits the opening of a pseudogap below 200 @xmath31 .",
    "this gap opens at 100 k , just below @xmath51 k , and strongly deepens below @xmath52 k , through a transfer of spectral weight towards higher frequencies .",
    "one should remark that the direct observation of a pseudogap in @xmath5 is unusual for the @xmath30 plane of cuprates , where such phenomena are typically detected in the carrier relaxation rate @xmath53 , after the application of an extended drude model @xcite .",
    "finally , a very interesting result is that the width of the present co gap ( 200 @xmath31 ) is comparable with that of the optical gap in superconducting lsco .",
    "this work reports an optical investigation of eu - doped lsco around the 1/8 commensurate doping .",
    "this member of the 214 family has been selected for its peculiar phase diagram , where the transitions between different structural , electronic , and magnetic phases are well separated in temperature .",
    "eu - doping produces in lsco a pronounced reduction of low - energy conductivity , which basing on the present infrared measurements can be ascribed mainly to a reduction in the plasma frequency and then in the number of the free carriers , despite eu being considered isovalent with la . in the underdoped samples with @xmath43 and @xmath44 , a fir peak is observed at @xmath54 @xmath31 which is similar to those detected in the other 214 compounds which exhibit charge and spin ordering .",
    "nevertheless , here the peak survives at temperatures much higher than both @xmath52 k and @xmath55 k , indicating that it is related to charge localization rather then to long - range ordering . only in the commensurate @xmath44 sample",
    "we find evidence for a strong effect below @xmath15 .",
    "this is the opening of a pseudogap 200 @xmath31 wide , caused by a pronounced hardening of the above peak , with a recovery of the sum rule around 600 @xmath31.the pseudogap energy value is impressively close to that for the maximum superconducting gap in the 214 family .",
    "this similarity in the energy scale between commensurate charge / spin ordering and superconductivity substantiates the observation that the former effect can compete with the cooper pair formation energy and therefore dramatically reduce @xmath6 in the cuprates of the 214 family .",
