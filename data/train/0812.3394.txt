    "the discovery of superconductivity in the iron pnictides,@xcite with the maximum reported transition temperature over 50 k,@xcite has spurred intense activities in both experiment and theory . while the initial research has mainly concentrated on compounds with @xmath1 structure , e.g. lafeaso@xmath2f@xmath3 ,",
    "superconductivity was later also found in oxygen - free materials with @xmath4 structure,@xcite with examples being cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 and bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 . according to their chemical composition , the two groups have been dubbed 1111 and 122 compounds , respectively . in both cases ,",
    "the structure consists of feas layers , which are believed to be responsible for the low - energy electronic properties .",
    "the temperature  doping phase diagram of lafeaso@xmath2f@xmath3 has been mapped out in some detail.@xcite at @xmath5 the material undergoes a structural transition into an orthorhombic phase upon cooling , closely followed by a magnetic transition .",
    "neutron diffraction shows that the order is of layered antiferromagnetic type , with an in - plane ordering wavevector @xmath6.@xcite with increasing @xmath7 , magnetism disappears abruptly at @xmath8 and gives way to superconductivity , with @xmath9 having little doping dependence up to @xmath10 .",
    "this phase diagram suggests interesting similarities to the high-@xmath9 cuprates , where a doping - driven transition from an antiferromagnet to a superconductor is found as well .",
    "however , a number of differences between the feas compounds and the cuprates are apparent .",
    "( i ) the `` undoped '' feas materials are not mott ( or charge - transfer ) insulators , but may be characterized as bad metals .",
    "( ii ) the feas magnetism is not fully consistent with a local - moment picture , as the size of the ordered moment is unexpectedly small , in the range @xmath11 @xcite to @xmath12,@xcite whereas a local moment on fe is expected to have at least @xmath13 .",
    "although magnetic frustration has been identified as a relevant ingredient,@xcite this alone is not enough to explain the experimental data .",
    "( iii ) in the doping regime where superconductivity occurs at low temperatures in the feas materials , the signatures of magnetism appear to be weak , although the magnetic susceptibility is larger than in a conventional metal,@xcite and a magnetic `` resonance '' mode has been reported below @xmath9 in ba(fe , co)@xmath0as@xmath0.@xcite    from first - principles calculations,@xcite the most important bands in the iron arsenides are of fe 3d character , with sizeable admixtures of as p states .",
    "importantly , all fe 3d orbitals appear to contribute to the low - energy properties .",
    "in contrast , in the cuprates only the cu 3d@xmath14 orbital ( together with o 2p@xmath15 ) contributes .",
    "thus , orbital degeneracy and strong hybridization likely play an important role in the iron arsenides .",
    "( it should be noted that the reported results of first - principles calculations are partially contradictory , in particular regarding the magnetic properties , see ref .  . )",
    "pressure experiments on cafe@xmath0as@xmath0  have provided interesting additional information.@xcite starting from the undoped magnetically ordered compound in the orthorhombic phase , the application of hydrostatic pressure induces a first - order transition at around 0.4 gpa into a ( compressed ) tetragonal phase , where magnetism disappears .",
    "remarkably , there is also a pressure - driven structural transition at elevated temperatures , from the ambient - pressure tetragonal phase into the compressed high - pressure tetragonal phase .",
    "this transition is accompanied by a drop in the resistivity , i.e. , the high - pressure phase appears to be a better conductor.@xcite band - structure calculations suggest that the disappearance of magnetism is intimately connected to the pressure - induced volume collapse.@xcite the high - pressure phase was reported to be superconducting @xcite with a @xmath9 of about 12k over a significant range of pressures , however , subsequent experiments@xcite with optimized hydrostatic pressure conditions did not detect superconductivity down to 4.2k , suggesting that the earlier reports were related to strain - induced superconductivity .",
    "nevertheless , all measurements agree on the volume collapse and the concomitant loss of magnetism and drop of resistivity . in addition",
    ", superconductivity under high pressures has also been reported@xcite in srfe@xmath0as@xmath0  and bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to propose a phenomenological local - moment - based scenario for the physics of the feas compounds , with the primary goal of explaining the pressure experiments on cafe@xmath0as@xmath0.@xcite our scenario is based on the assumption that bands with more itinerant electrons co - exist and interact with more localized ( i.e. moderately to strongly correlated ) ones , which renders the problem similar to kondo or anderson models for heavy - fermion metals .",
    "( we note that related ideas on localized and itinerant electrons in iron arsenides have been put forward in a few recent theory papers@xcite which appeared while this work was being completed . )",
    "our analysis will draw analogies to recent developments in heavy - fermion physics , particular , we shall associate the pressure - induced transition in cafe@xmath0as@xmath0  with a variant of the kondo volume - collapse transition , driven by a large increase of the hybridization between the itinerant and localized electron bands , which in turn quenches the magnetism .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : scen ] we sketch our general ideas and point out similarities and differences between the iron arsenides and classical heavy - fermion materials .",
    "we then illustrate the proposal by a simple mean - field calculation in sec .",
    "[ sec : mf ] , which we believe captures important parts of the relevant physics of the cafe@xmath0as@xmath0  pressure experiments .",
    "a discussion of implications will wrap up the paper .",
    "our proposal is based on the assertion that electronic correlations in the iron arsenides are sizeable.@xcite then , the magnetism is not purely of weak - coupling type , but instead local - moment physics is relevant.@xcite this view appears consistent with the results of neutron scattering experiments , which find spin - wave excitations in the antiferromagnetic ground state of cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 , that are well - described by an anisotropic 3d heisenberg model , at least for long wavelengths.@xcite    to explain the fact that the antiferromagnetic phase of feas compounds is neither an insulator nor a good metal , we invoke the existence of ( at least ) two types of electrons , one more localized and one more itinerant species . in the spirit of a kondo or anderson lattice model , we shall adopt here the language of `` local - moment '' and `` conduction '' electrons . in the antiferromagnetic phase ,",
    "the local - moment electrons carry the magnetism , and the residual interaction between local - moment and itinerant electrons provides sizeable scattering , leading to both bad - metal behavior and reduced moment amplitudes.@xcite in the paramagnetic phase , the local - moment electrons are strongly hybridized with the conduction electrons ( i.e. the moments are kondo - screened ) , leading to good metallic behavior . provided that spin fluctuations are still sizeable , spin - fluctuation mediated superconductivity can arise at low temperatures .    how does this phenomenological picture tie in with microscopic considerations ?",
    "the most plausible scenario is that both types of electrons are primarily of fe 3d character , with strong admixtures of as 2p . as detailed in ref .",
    ", the interplay of p - d hybridization , spin - orbit coupling , and crystal - field splitting can lead to the two highest occupied feas levels being filled with one electron , but with different correlation strengths .",
    "the electrons in the lower level are more localized , providing a natural basis for our phenomenological approach.@xcite    assuming the applicability of an anderson lattice picture , let us further develop our ideas , concentrating on the transition between the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases . in fact , many qualitative results can be borrowed from recent theoretical work on heavy - fermion materials . there",
    ", the zero - temperature transition between a paramagnetic heavy fermi liquid and an antiferromagnetic metal can be a standard spin - density - wave transition of a fermi liquid , described by a landau - ginzburg - wilson theory of hertz - millis type , or involve the breakdown of kondo screening.@xcite for the latter scenario , a number of theoretical descriptions have been put forward.@xcite within the kondo - breakdown scenario of senthil _",
    "et al._,@xcite the coupling to lattice degrees of freedom has been investigated recently.@xcite if the electron  lattice coupling is sufficiently strong , then the kondo - breakdown transition is rendered first order and accompanied by a isostructural volume change , which is a zero - temperature variant@xcite of the classical kondo volume collapse transition.@xcite this first - order transition extends to finite temperatures and masks an otherwise existing magnetic quantum critical point .",
    "( a first - order transition removes the sharp distinction between the kondo - breakdown and spin - density - wave transition scenarios . )    in a situation with intermediate correlations , where valence fluctuations are not fully quenched , it is useful to think about the kondo breakdown transition as an orbital - selective mott transition:@xcite in the non - magnetic fermi liquid phase , the local - moment electrons become itinerant and strongly hybridized with the conduction electrons , whereas they undergo mott localization in the magnetic phase .",
    "in fact , such orbital - selective mott transition have been studied extensively in two - band hubbard models.@xcite based on the cited works , we propose that the pressure - driven transition in cafe@xmath0as@xmath0  can be described as orbital - selective mott transition , which becomes strongly first order due to electron  lattice coupling .",
    "the low - pressure phase displays partial mott localization , leading to local - moment magnetism , whereas in the high - pressure phase strong hybridization quenches the moments and leads to a conventional paramagnetic fermi liquid .",
    "the pressure - driven iso - structural lattice transition at elevated temperatures is then the analogue of a kondo volume collapse .",
    "it is important to point out that our scenario is not in contradiction with itinerant spin - density - wave descriptions of magnetism in the feas compounds . in the kondo - lattice context",
    ", itinerant and local - moment magnetism can be adiabatically connected ( apart from transitions involving changes of the fermi surface topology).@xcite therefore , a system at intermediate coupling can in principle be described using both itinerant and localized electron concepts . here",
    ", we find it advantageous to employ a strong - coupling language in order to highlight the nature of the volume collapse transition .",
    "independent of the language , the driving force of the volume collapse is the energy gain due to an increasing in the effective hybridization between the bands .",
    "let us note that there are a few important differences between our envisioned scenario for the feas materials and the phenomenology of heavy - fermions compounds .",
    "( i ) the local - moment electrons in the iron arsenides are probably far from the kondo limit .",
    "then valence fluctuations are sizeable , and the picture of kondo screening does not literally apply .",
    "the coherence temperature on the high - pressure side of the transition is not small , and the quasiparticles are not very heavy , in contrast to that of typical heavy fermions .",
    "( ii ) the character of the @xmath6 magnetic order is important to understand the details of the phase diagram .",
    "the magnetism deserves a few further comments : in order to explain the magnetic order at wavevector @xmath6 , both local - moment and itinerant scenarios have been invoked ( which are not mutually exclusive.@xcite ) in a local - moment picture , the exchange interactions @xmath16 and @xmath17 on the square lattice of fe atoms ( between nearest and next - nearest neighbors , respectively ) have been deduced to be both antiferromagnetic with @xmath18.@xcite in this regime , the @xmath16-@xmath17 square - lattice heisenberg antiferromagnet is known to have a `` layered '' antiferromagnetic ground state with @xmath6 order.@xcite in contrast , in an itinerant picture the @xmath6 order arises from nearly nested fermi surface pieces .",
    "independent of whether the magnetism is better described in an itinerant or localized picture , magnetic ordering at @xmath6 in a originally tetragonal environment breaks the @xmath19 lattice rotation symmetry .",
    "this induces an orthorhombic distortion inside the antiferromagnetic phase .",
    "however , the lattice rotation symmetry may also be broken at a higher temperature than the spin symmetry , in which case the orthorhombic distortion occurs before the magnetic order.@xcite this is indeed what happens experimentally , i.e. , magnetic fluctuations are likely the driving force of the structural phase transition .",
    "last not least , we discuss the possible emergence of superconductivity . for the kondo - breakdown scenario ,",
    "magnetically mediated pairing has been argued to be a generic instability of the fermi liquid,@xcite with the maximum @xmath9 near the continuous kondo - breakdown transition . in the present situation of intermediate correlations ,",
    "the absolute value of @xmath9 will depend strongly on microscopic details , e.g. , of the band structure .",
    "moreover , if the lattice coupling renders the transition strongly first order , the system will effectively `` jump '' over the parameter region with large @xmath9 .",
    "thus , while both pressure - induced volume collapse and loss of magnetism are integral and robust parts of the proposed scenario , superconductivity with a sizeable @xmath9 is more fragile .",
    "we now illustrate the ideas described in the last section by a simple model calculation .",
    "we shall refrain from using a realistic band structure with five or more bands , but instead employ a two - band anderson lattice model which is sufficient to capture most of the qualitative physics .",
    "the starting point of our analysis is an anderson lattice model , describing delocalized conduction ( @xmath20 ) electrons on a lattice which hybridize with correlated and more localized @xmath21 electrons on the same lattice .",
    "( despite the labels @xmath20 and @xmath21 , both bands may have primarily fe 3d character . ) to simplify the approximate treatment of magnetism , we supplement our model by an explicit heisenberg exchange interaction between the local moments .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian reads @xmath22 in standard notation .",
    "the first term describes conduction electrons with band filling @xmath23 , @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) is the bare @xmath21 electron energy ( coulomb repulsion ) , @xmath26 the hybridization matrix element , and @xmath27 the number of unit cells .",
    "@xmath28 is the operator for the spin moment of the @xmath21 electrons on site @xmath29 .",
    "although the system is three - dimensional , we shall neglect the electronic coupling between the layers for simplicity , hence the model will be treated on a 2d square lattice .",
    "further we shall assume @xmath30 , and take the heisenberg interaction @xmath31 to be non - zero for nearest and next - nearest neighbors , with values @xmath32 .",
    "note that the kondo limit will not be taken .",
    "elastic energy changes of the lattice under application of hydrostatic pressure depend on the lattice distortion . for tetragonal lattice symmetry ,",
    "the most general form of the elastic contribution to the free enthalpy is @xcite @xmath33 here , the dimensionless @xmath34 are the diagonal entries of the strain tensor , i.e. , the relative changes of the lattice parameters of the tetragonal unit cell .",
    "the elastic constants @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and the reference volume @xmath37 depend on the material at hand .",
    "below , we shall choose values for the @xmath35 , @xmath36 such that the experimentally observed lattice distortions of cafe@xmath0as@xmath0  ( ref .  )",
    "are approximately reproduced .",
    "importantly , the largest pressure - induced change is the collapse of @xmath38 , whereas @xmath39 even increase slightly at the collapse .",
    "we now construct a model for the electron  lattice coupling , combining the results from different approaches with simple theoretical arguments .",
    "we start with the strain dependence of the magnetic couplings @xmath16 and @xmath17 which are responsible for the ambient - pressure magnetism , and will also be relevant for spin - fluctuation - mediated superconductivity . in experiment ,",
    "antiferromagnetic ordering at wavevector @xmath6 is energetically stabilized by an orthorhombic distortion with @xmath40 .",
    "additional evidence is the strong dependence of @xmath41 and @xmath42 on the strain @xmath38 , as shown in band structure calculations.@xcite in addition , it has been shown@xcite that changes in the fe - as bond angle stabilize antiferromagnetic ordering at wavevector @xmath6 , providing an additional hint towards the importance of coupling all strain directions to the exchange couplings .",
    "we therefore parameterize @xmath43 . \\label{heisen}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from neutron scattering data and lda calculations for the orthorhombic phase of cafe@xmath0as@xmath0  @xcite a rough estimate of @xmath44 can be obtained . for @xmath45 ,",

    "the size and sign of @xmath44 might well account for the observed orthorhombic distortion and the @xmath6 ordering vector , as argued in ref . .",
    "from band - structure calculations for lifeas @xcite it is suggested that @xmath50 and @xmath51 are numbers of @xmath52 , whereas their signs turn out to depend on pressure . to account for the vanishing superconductivity at high pressures , we chose their sign to be positive , since @xmath50 and @xmath51 dominate the changes in @xmath41 and @xmath42 at high pressures.@xcite finally , @xmath53 is of subleading influence within our calculation as long as it is of @xmath52 or smaller , which is suggested by the order of magnitude of @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "a crucial ingredient for our model is the strain dependence of the hybridization , which we assume to be the dominant mechanism to drive the volume collapse , as observed in the kondo volume collapse in cerium and other materials . in general ,",
    "the mechanism for the kondo volume collapse transition is a gain in hybridization energy via a structural distortion .",
    "a plausible parameterization is @xmath54 .",

    "the experimental behavior of the cafe@xmath0as@xmath0  lattice constants,@xcite @xmath60 is crucial .",
    "we shall also take @xmath61 , but this is subdominant .",
    "finally , we neglect any dependence of the @xmath20 dispersion @xmath62 and the @xmath21 energy @xmath63 on lattice strain .",
    "while such a dependence certainly exists , it will not qualitatively change our picture , which is dominated by the effects parameterized in equations ( [ heisen ] ) and ( [ hybrid ] ) ; moreover , a pressure dependence of the bandwidth can be absorbed in a pressure dependence of the reference energy scale of our calculation .",
    "the model will be solved using a standard mean - field theory , with a fermionic representation of the local moments and slave bosons to deal with strong local repulsions .",
    "theories of this type have been extensively used in the study of the kondo and anderson lattice and also allows to deal with the magnetic exchange term in eq .",

    "for @xmath73 , our superconducting transition temperature close to the critical pressure is of order 50k , whereas the nel temperature is somewhat below room temperature . while these values could be brought closer to the experimental ones of ref .  , we refrain from doing so , because inter - plane coupling and fluctuation effects , both absent from our treatment , will significantly modify the mean - field result . for @xmath102",

    "hence , we conclude that the volume collapse and orbital - selective mott transition are robust features of our model , but , in contrast , superconductivity with a sizeable @xmath9 is not .",

    "( in principle , it is conceivable that fluctuation effects not captured by our treatment have a similar effect . )",
    "the hybridization @xmath55 displays a large jump at the critical pressure , fig .",
    "[ parameters]c  this is , within our theory , the mechanism which balances the increase in elastic energy connected with the volume collapse .",
    "the pairing fields undergo several changes as function of pressure , see fig .",
    "[ parameters]d for @xmath73 , which depend sensitively on the pressure dependence of the exchange couplings and other microscopic parameters .",
    "the dominant pairing is of @xmath85 symmetry as above , both for the spinon pairing of localized @xmath21 electrons in the magnetic small - pressure phase as well as for the superconductivity of itinerant @xmath21 electrons at high pressure ( again with a small @xmath122 admixture at low temperatures , which disappears for @xmath102 ) .",
    "slight changes of @xmath147 stabilize saddle points with other pairing symmetries , but leave the non - superconducting part of the phase diagram essentially unchanged .",
    "finally , the @xmath21 occupation jumps from 1 to @xmath148 across the transition for all temperatures below 60mev ( not shown ) .",
    "in this paper , we have proposed a theoretical scenario to rationalize the pressure - induced phase transitions in cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 .",
    "underlying the scenario is the physics of the anderson lattice , used for heavy - fermion metals : strongly localized electrons hybridize with more itinerant electrons .",
    "microscopically , both may be primarily of fe 3d character , as discussed in ref .",
    "( although this is not required within our phenomenological approach ) . at ambient pressure , the localized electrons order antiferromagnetically in a collinear arrangement at low temperatures , accompanied by an orthorhombic lattice distortion .",
    "the system is weakly metallic , due to the presence of the itinerant carriers with a `` small '' fermi volume . increasing pressure drives a transition towards a paramagnetic fermi liquid , where the previously localized electrons become itinerant and non - magnetic .",
    "the coupling to the lattice degrees of freedom in cafe@xmath0as@xmath0  renders this transition strongly first order  this is akin to a kondo volume collapse ( although the system is not in the kondo regime , and valence fluctuations are sizeable ) .",
    "the first - order nature of the transition , already in the purely electronic theory , implies a tendency towards phase separation , which appears to be present experimentally.@xcite    this set of ideas holds plausible explanations for ( i ) the coincidence of volume - collapse and magnetic  non - magnetic transition ( which is also borne out by first - principles approaches @xcite , ( ii ) the bad metallic behavior , and ( iii ) the reduced magnetic moment of the magnetic phase .",
    "note that ( ii ) and ( iii ) are not described by the mean - field theory , but arise from residual scattering between itinerant and localized electrons in the orbital - selective mott regime as small pressure .",
    "moreover , the abrupt disappearance of strong magnetism in the high - pressure phase is a natural part of the story",
    ". theoretically , superconductivity mediated by residual spin fluctuations emerges at high pressure and low temperatures .",
    "the conflicting experimental reports @xcite on superconductivity in cafe@xmath0as@xmath0  may be consistent with the strong sensitivity of @xmath9 on microscopic parameters expected from theory and with sample inhomogeneities as proposed in ref .  .",
    "the strong first - order volume collapse has only been observed in cafe@xmath0as@xmath0   so what is special about this compound ?",
    "while we can not give a definite answer at this point , the current status of both theory and experiment suggests that cafe@xmath0as@xmath0  ( i ) is a particularly soft material with a small c - axis lattice constant , ( ii ) displays a large electron  phonon coupling , and ( iii ) is located in close vicinity to a magnetic  non - magnetic transition .",
    "indeed , first - principles calculations@xcite have reported a giant magneto - elastic coupling .",
    "in particular , the magnitude of the fe moment has been found to be coupled to the c - axis lattice constant , with this effect being strongest in cafe@xmath0as@xmath0as compared to other 122 and also to 1111 compounds .",
    "moreover , a soft lattice is known to be a crucial ingredient to a first - order volume - collapse scenario.@xcite note that , in our calculations , a small volume jump remains even for hard lattices due to the first - order nature of the purely electronic transition .",
    "our conceptual ideas are not in conflict with itinerant spin - density - wave descriptions of the feas magnetism , but constitute a more strong - coupling - inspired view on the same physics .",
    "we speculate that an orbital - selective mott scenario , likely with a continuous instead of a first - order transition , could apply to doping - driven transitions in iron arsenides as well , as a specific filling of the conduction band is not required .",
