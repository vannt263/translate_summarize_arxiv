    "form a quasi-2d electron gas at the interface .",
    "doping impurities are separated from the 2d electron gas making the transport ballistic over the nanostructure .",
    "this enhances the importance of quantum mechanical effects .",
    "an interesting 2d nanostructure is the quantum wire ( qw ) , which is a laterally narrow electron pathway connecting two ( infinite ) electrodes . because of the ballistic electron transport the conductance is quantized in units of the quantum @xmath2 .",
    "the 2d electron states are quantized in the direction perpendicular to the axis of the wire .",
    "each occupied perpendicular state gives rise to one conducting mode adding one quantum to the conductance . in a typical measurement ,",
    "the conductance is recorded as a function of the gate voltage which lowers the potential in the wire region , influencing its width or the average electron density .",
    "the increase in the number of conducting modes results in a staircase as a function of the gate voltage .",
    "recently , kane et al . @xcite and reilly et al .",
    "@xcite have measured conductances of qw s with different geometries .",
    "the quantization of the conductance is clearly seen in the measurements .",
    "a short quantum wire can be characterized as a quantum point contact ( qpc ) .",
    "qpc s exhibit the so - called 0.7-anomaly which is a small plateau in conductance around 0.7 - 0.5  g@xmath0 as a function of the gate voltage @xcite .",
    "the plateau moves from 0.7  g@xmath0 to 0.5  g@xmath0 as the electron density in the quantum wire is lowered or the qpc is in a strong magnetic field . the plateau becomes more pronounced when temperature increases from the milli - kelvin region to a few kelvin . at higher temperatures the anomaly disappears .",
    "the length of the wire affects also the anomaly @xcite so that in long wires the anomaly is around 0.5  g@xmath0 and in shorter ones around 0.7  g@xmath0 .",
    "the measurements show a short plateau also within the next quantum step around 1.5  ...  1.76  g@xmath0 .",
    "there are several different explanations for the 0.7 anomaly .",
    "one of them @xcite is based on the kondo model where an unpaired electron is localized at the qpc . in the ground state",
    "this electron is in the spin - singlet state with the scattering electrons from the leads .",
    "the spin coupling results in a high density of states , a kondo resonance , at the fermi level and thus in an enhanced conductance around zero bias voltage .",
    "this zero - bias anomaly is similar to the kondo effect in single - electron transistors @xcite . in the case of the qpc",
    "the kondo model seemingly explains the plateaus and their behavior as a function of the temperature and the external magnetic field @xcite    another explanation is provided by the semi - empirical model by reilly _",
    "_ @xcite . in this model",
    "the plateau is caused by the local spin polarization of the electron gas at the qpc . for small electron densities at the qpc the polarization vanishes , but when the electron density is increased using the gate voltage a spin gap opens and causes the polarization .",
    "the opening of the spin - gap depends on the qpc configuration and temperature , and in different cases the conductance plateaus appear at different values .",
    "a spin - polarization model has also been presented by berggren and yakimenko @xcite .",
    "they used the density - functional theory ( dft ) to calculate the electron density in a quantum wire as function of the gate voltage .",
    "the conductance was calculated using the bttiker model @xcite with parameters obtained by fitting the effective dft potential in the middle of the qw .",
    "also meir _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and hirose _ et al . _",
    "@xcite reported dft calculations for a qw in order to model the qpc resonance states needed in the kondo model .",
    "also recent measurements utilising the resonant interaction between couplet qw s show evidence of the formation of localized magnetic moment in a constriction of the 2d electron gas @xcite .    in this work",
    "we investigate the spontaneous spin - polarization model for qw s .",
    "our aim is to make within this model accurate and realistic calculations for the conductance , in order to study how far the model can describe the experimental findings .",
    "we use the dft and the green s functions techniques ( see , for example xue _",
    "@xcite ) to calculate the electron density and the conductance . for the electron spin densities",
    "the use of the green s function technique is computationally more demanding than solving for the wave functions of a finite system .",
    "however , it has important advantages .",
    "first , an infinite system without any artificial periodicity can be treated .",
    "it is also possible to add the bias voltage between the electrodes and calculate the charge density and the current through the structure self - consistently .",
    "we solve for the dft - green s function equations numerically by the finite - element method using our recent implementation @xcite .",
    "we use the effective atomic units which are derived by setting the fundamental constants @xmath3 , and the material constants @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath6 are the relative effective electron mass and the relative dielectric constant respectively .",
    "the effective atomic units are transformed to the usual atomic and si units with the relations    [ cols= \" < ,",
    "< , < , < \" , ]     above , the numbers on the right - hand side are obtained by using the parameters for gaas , i.e. @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",

    "ha denotes the hartree energy unit .",
    "our strictly 2d model for a qw is shown in fig .",
    "[ kvanttikontakti ] .",
    "we use a simplified geometry in order to see the effects due to different shapes of the wire .",
    "the calculation area , @xmath9 , consists of the qw and some parts of the electrodes .",
    "the semi - infinite electrodes consist of the positive background charge with the constant density of @xmath10 and the neutralizing 2d electron gas with the density @xmath11 .    at both sides of the electrodes and the wire",
    "we include some empty vacuum , and the electron density is required to vanish at the outer boundaries parallel to the wires .",
    "the electron density at the axis of the electrode is then typical for gaas / gaalas systems and the fermi energy ( the width of the occupied energy band ) is 0.63  ha=7.1  mev .",
    "the neutrality makes the calculation of the electrostatic potential in the self - consistent dft calculations possible .",
    "the qw is also modeled using a rigid uniform positive background charge .",
    "we control the positive charge density @xmath12 in the wire region @xmath13 ( the darker area in fig .",
    "[ kvanttikontakti ] ) in order to mimic the effects of a gate voltage .",
    "the denser the background charge the deeper the effective potential is , i.e. @xmath14 where @xmath15 are the 2d coordinates .",
    "we calculate @xmath16 at the midpoint of the wire and use this value as the gate voltage in our illustrations below .",
    "the dependence of the gate voltage can be written in the form @xmath17 where the coefficient @xmath18 depends on the shape of the wire . @xmath18 = 218mv@xmath19 , 234mv@xmath19 and 248mv@xmath19 for wires with the width @xmath20 of 5@xmath21 and lengths @xmath22 of 6@xmath21 , 7@xmath21 and 8@xmath21 , respectively .",
    "in chapter iii we denote these wires as d , e and f.    we use the dft within the local density - approximation to calculate the electron density . in the self - consistent iterations",
    "the electron density is first calculated using green s functions .",
    "the electron density is then used to calculate the effective potential @xmath23 as @xmath24 above , the first term on the right - hand side is the coulomb potential , computed as an integral and not from the poisson equation because of the 2d calculation space . the electron density in the electrodes @xmath25 is assumed to coincide with that in an infinite uniform wire",
    ". then we can include the outside regions into the coulomb integral within the buffer regions @xmath26 and @xmath27 which are large enough .",
    "for the exchange - correlation potential , @xmath28 , we use the 2d - lda functional by attaccalite _",
    "the potential @xmath29 is a linear ramp taking care of the boundary conditions under a finite bias so that the potential in the left electrode is shifted relative to that in the right electrode by a given bias voltage @xmath30 .",
    "the effective potential determines through the green s functions a new electron density and the procedure is repeated until convergence .",
    "the retarded green s function is obtained by solving the equation @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the electron energy . at the boundaries @xmath33 we use open boundary conditions given by the dirichlet - to - neumann map on the boundary .",
    "this means that there are no reflections .",
    "one can next calculate the so - called lesser green s function , @xmath34 . for zero bias ,",
    "when the fermi functions in the left and right electrodes are identical , i.e. @xmath35 , @xmath36 is obtained as @xmath37 in the non - equilibrium situation when @xmath38 we have @xmath39 above , @xmath40 are functions connecting the calculation area to the outside electrodes .",
    "they have nonzero values only on the boundaries @xmath41 .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath36 is related to the density of states , and the electron density is calculated by integrating over the energy @xmath42 the local density of states ( ldos ) in the qw region is calculated as @xmath43 ldos is a continuous function in our calculations and thus the finite - size effects are small .",
    "the electron tunneling probability @xmath44 is calculated as a function of the electron energy using the green s functions as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is green s advanced function .",
    "thus one needs the green s function values only at the boundaries @xmath41 . for a finite bias",
    "the electric current is calculated as @xmath47 where the fermi functions @xmath48 and @xmath49 are shifted with respect to each other by the bias voltage @xmath30 .",
    "in the zero bias limit @xmath50 and one obtains the linear - response conductance @xmath51 at zero temperature the conductance is simply @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the fermi energy . at a finite temperature also",
    "electron states with energies near the fermi level contribute to the conductance , as the derivate of the fermi function @xmath54 differs from the delta function .",
    "a finite temperature influences the solution also through the electron density ( cf .",
    "eqs ( [ ele1 ] ) and ( [ ele2 ] ) ) .",
    "below we show also differential conductances corresponding to given bias voltages . at zero temperature",
    "they can be computed from the approximation @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a small increment in the bias voltage .",
    "we have numerically implemented the non - equilibrium dft - based scheme using the finite - element method as explained earlier @xcite .",
    "the size of the matrices to be inverted is determined by the number of the finite - element basis functions needed in the calculations .",
    "we have implemented 2d high - order polynomial bases @xcite up to the fourth order in order to reduce the basis size . in a typical calculation",
    "the number of basis functions ranges from 2800 for to high - order polynomials to 5500 for low - order polynomials .",
    "in this model , there are electronic resonance states in the qw , which are reflected as peaks in the ldos ( see fig .",
    "[ ldos ] below ) .",
    "the peaks are broader in short and wide qw s than in long and thin ones , because short qw s are more strongly connected to the electrodes .",
    "if the resonance peaks are narrow enough , a spontaneous spin polarization may occur with a spin gap opening between the spin - up and spin - down states below and above the fermi level , respectively .",
    "the polarization occurs in a limited range of gate voltages . at small gate voltages",
    "there is no polarization and it disappears again at large voltages .",
    "this is in accordance with the density - dependent opening of the spin gap speculated by reilly _",
    ". _ @xcite . a solution with spin polarization in the qw",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ spin ] which gives the total electron density and the difference between the spin - up and spin - down densities .",
    "the electron wave functions have in this case no nodes in the direction perpendicular to the qw , so that there is only a single conducting mode .",
    "berggren and yakimenko @xcite have studied the spin polarization in qw s . in their calculations",
    "the electrodes are modeled by two large quantum dots which are connected by the qw .",
    "the potential and the electron density inside the qw are controlled by a gate voltage .",
    "the electron density is calculated from the wave functions using the dft within the lda .",
    "they obtain a spin polarization which closely resembles our results .",
    "the spread of the polarization in the electrodes is somewhat larger than in our cases which show only a small oscillating polarization outside the qw .",
    "berggren and yakimenko do not report on the details of the resonance peaks in the dos .",
    "the resonance state parameters are crucial in the kondo model .",
    "therefore meir _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have used the dft to model the qpc . in their calculations",
    "the semi - infinite electrodes are modeled by wires with a parabolic confinement potential perpendicular to the wire axis , and a raise in the external potential forms the qpc as a saddle - point . due to the different potential construction the resonance peaks obtained by meir _",
    "are remarkably wider than those in our calculations .",
    "a similar qpc construction is used also in the calculations by hirose _",
    "the polarizations they obtain are similar to our results for long qw s .",
    "the conductances of three qw s a , b and c with different widths are shown in fig .",
    "[ monta ] as a function of the gate voltage at zero temperature .",
    "the qw s have the same length l=7",
    "a@xmath57 but for a , b , and c the widths s=5  a@xmath57 , 6  a@xmath57 and 10  a@xmath57 , respectively .",
    "the staircase quantizations of the conductances are clearly seen . for the widest wire c the perpendicular states are denser in energy than for the thinner wires",
    "a and b , so that the conductance steps are shortest for c. the first plateau for c is also disturbed by the states decaying from the electrodes to the qw . wires a and b are connected more weakly to the electrodes and for them the first plateau is clearer . a weak connection causes also the spin - polarization in wire a , seen as a short plateau clearly below 1  g@xmath0 .",
    "wire c is not polarized and in wire b the polarization is not strong enough to cause plateaus deviating from integer of g@xmath0 values .",
    "the gate voltage drives the electrostatic potential quite uniformly within the qw . in experiments ,",
    "side gates are often used to control the potential @xcite .",
    "these gates not only increase the potential in the qw , but they also make it narrower . the result is a conductance staircase as a function of the gate voltage .",
    "the first measured plateaus corresponding to 1g@xmath0 are pronounced @xcite in contrast to our shoulder - like first plateau for wire c. below we are concerned mainly with the conductance plateaus below 1g@xmath0 and therefore we discuss wires with the width s=5",

    "[ cont_lenght ] as a function of the gate voltage and at zero temperature .",
    "the figure shows clearly the effect of the electrode - wire connection .",
    "the long wires have clear peaks due to the resonances .",
    "the heights of the peaks are 0.5  g@xmath0 , meaning that only a single electron polarized mode contributes to them . the wires with the lengths l=6 ... 8  a@xmath57 exhibit resonances which are just narrow enough for the spin polarization to appear .",
    "the length dependence of the conductance among these three wires is in qualitative agreement with the recent measurements for qw s by reilly _",
    "@xcite , although the wires in the experiments are clearly longer than in our calculations .",
    "berggren and yakimenko @xcite have also calculated the conductance of their qw system using a rough scheme .",
    "they fit parabolic curves to the effective potential in the middle of the qw .",
    "the fitting parameters are then used in the bttiker model for the conductance .",
    "the results have the same overall features as ours for the longest wires in fig .",
    "[ cont_lenght ] , but the changes in the polarization and in the conductance are less abrupt in our calculations . berggren and yakimenko argue that the rapid changes are due to the finite - size effects .",
    "therefore our results describing infinite systems seem to support their statement .",
    "the conductance - gate voltage curves by berggren and yakimenko show two plateaus , one plateau when the polarization appears and another one at @xmath580.75  g@xmath0 , just before the polarization disappears .",
    "this result resembles our curves for the long wire with l=10  @xmath21 .",
    "however , there is a notable difference that in our calculations for the long wires the polarization at low gate voltages is first nearly perfect whereas that by berggren and yakimenko is first absent and appears then as a partial polarization . in",
    "our conductance curves only one plateau is seen when the polarization reaches its maximal value .",
    "the effect of the temperature on the conductance behavior of three qpc - like wires d , e and f is shown in fig  [ gate_temp ] . at zero temperature , wire d ( l=6  a@xmath57 ) shows no plateau , whereas wire e ( l=7  a@xmath57 ) has a plateau at @xmath580.7  g@xmath57 and wire",

    "when temperature increases the plateaus below @xmath59 in wires e and f shift down wards and become smoother .",
    "wire d shows a weak temperature dependence so that the slope at @xmath580.7g@xmath0 decreases .",
    "reilly _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have presented a phenomenological model for the appearance and the location of the conductance plateaus .",
    "they report on the measurements of three qpc s and explain their conductance behaviors .",
    "two of the qpc s have plateaus at @xmath580.5  g@xmath0 and @xmath580.7  g@xmath0 and the third one has a very weak plateau at @xmath580.6  g@xmath0 .",
    "the qpc s , d , e and f in fig .",
