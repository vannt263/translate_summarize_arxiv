    "the perovskite structure of strontium ruthenate , sr@xmath2ruo@xmath3 is very similar to that of hts copper oxides .",
    "however , its superconducting transition temperature t@xmath0 is relatively low ( t@xmath0 @xmath5 1 k ) [ 1 ] .",
    "nevertheless , recent reports indicate that its cooper pairs are not of the usual s  wave symmetry .",
    "in fact they suggest that this material features triplet pairing and is a superconducting analogue of the @xmath6he superfluid system [ 1 - 4 ] .",
    "clearly , the possibility of exotic pairing engenders interest in the effects of disorder on the superconducting properties .",
    "moreover , studies of the electronic structure [ 2,3 ] have identified an extended van hove singularity close to the fermi energy e@xmath1 , and therefore one may wonder whether the van hove scenario could lead to a rise in t@xmath0 with doping .",
    "evidently , since doping the system always increases the disorder one should investigate both aspects simultaneously .",
    "we base our discussion on the extended negative u hubbard hamiltonian :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the usual , site occupational number operator @xmath10 evidently the above @xmath11 is the charge operator on site labelled @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the chemical potential , which at @xmath14 is equal to fermi energy @xmath15 .",
    "disorder is introduced into the problem by allowing the local site energy @xmath16 to vary randomly from site to site . finally , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the fermion creation and annihilation operators for an electron on site @xmath12 with spin @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the amplitude for hopping from site @xmath21 to site @xmath12 and @xmath22 is the attractive interaction ( @xmath23 ) which causes superconductivity .    in the hartree - fock - gorkov approximation",
    "the equation for the green s function @xmath24 , corresponding to the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "1 , is given by :    @xmath25 { { \\mbox{\\boldmath{$g$ } } }   } ( l , j ; \\imath \\omega_n ) = { { \\mbox{\\boldmath{$1 $ } } }   } \\delta_{ij},\\ ] ]    where @xmath26 is matsubara frequency.let us define the random potential @xmath27 by :    @xmath28,\\ ] ]    where @xmath16 is uniformly distributed on the energy interval @xmath29 $ ] .",
    "the green s function for an impurity , described by @xmath27 in eq .",
    "3 , embedded in the medium , described by @xmath30 is given by : @xmath31\\}^{-1 }   { { \\mbox{\\boldmath{$g$ } } }   } ^c   ( i , i , \\imath \\omega_n),\\ ] ] following the usual cpa procedure we demand that the coherent potential greens function @xmath32 satisfy the relation :    @xmath33    evidently , eq .",
    "5 completely determines , that is to say can be solved for , @xmath30 .",
    "let us now proceed further with the cpa strategy [ 5 ] and determine the averaged greens function matrix @xmath34 subject to the self consistency conditions : @xmath35    in this paper we assumed nearest neighbour electron hopping and pairing on a two dimensional lattice . in figure 1@xmath36 and @xmath37 we have presented fermi surfaces for @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively .",
    "the latter case correspond to the situation , where the fermi energy , @xmath15 , is located exactly at the van hove singularity .",
    "the linearised gap equation for the critical temperature t@xmath0 of p - wave superconducting phase transition reads as follows [ 6 ] :    @xmath40    a useful measure of disorder is the resistivity @xmath41 .",
    "thus we shall study the relationship between @xmath41 and t@xmath0 .",
    "the residual resistivity @xmath41 for low temperature can be obtained from the kubo  greenwood formula . for the disordered two dimensional systems at hand [ 7 ] :    @xmath42 ^ 2 \\right\\}^{-1},\\ ] ]    where e is the electron charge , @xmath43 is plank constant and @xmath44 is the distance between ruo@xmath2 planes .    in short ,",
    "we have solved the cpa equations ( eqs .",
    "4,5 ) for various system parameters ( eq .",
    "1 ) and calculated both t@xmath0 and residual resistivity @xmath41 .    to illustrate how effective a van hove singularity can be in raising t@xmath0 , in fig .",
    "2@xmath36 we present t@xmath0 , calculated for clean systems and normalised to its maximal value t@xmath45 , versus band filling @xmath46 for various values of @xmath47 .",
    "clearly , t@xmath0 is peaked at @xmath39 , where the fermi energy @xmath15 is exactly at the van hove singularity . for small enough interaction",
    "@xmath48 it is enlarged by a factor of 7 .",
    "going further we turn to our results for the disordered case .",
    "thus , in fig .",
    "2@xmath37 , we plotted t@xmath0 versus residual resistivity @xmath41 as calculated by the cpa procedure described above .",
    "the parameters @xmath49 as well as band filling @xmath38 were chosen so that the t@xmath0 vs. @xmath41 curve reproduce the experiments [ 1 ] .",
    "unlike the born approximation limit , the cpa residual resestivity is dependent on the strength of disordered potential , @xmath50 , nonlinearly .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "3@xmath36 , where the different curves correspond to different band fillings @xmath46 .",
    "the pronounced nonlinearity for n=1 is due to a van hove singularity being near @xmath15 . as shown in fig .",
    "3b this give rise to an interesting upturn as @xmath51 in the t@xmath0 vs. @xmath41 plot .",
    "our results confirm that , similarly to d  wave superconductors [ 5 ] , in the case of p  wave paring the critical temperature t@xmath0 is very sensitive function of nonmagnetic diagonal disorder .",
    "nevertheless , they sugest that in sr@xmath2ruo@xmath3 doping could lead to higher value of critical temperature t@xmath0 . here",
    "we used uniform distribution of site energy levels @xmath16 as the simplest model of disorder .",
    "clearly further study of the problem would include a more sophisticated impurity model , and more realistic band structure .",
