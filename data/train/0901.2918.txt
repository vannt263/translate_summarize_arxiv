    "the study of ferromagnetic hysteresis represents an open field of current interest , due to the applications in magnetic recording technology and spintronic devices @xcite . from a purely theoretical point of view , the dynamics of disordered magnetic systems represents a central problem in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "one of the central questions arising in the analysis of ferromagnetic systems , is the link between the domain structure and the hysteretic properties , such as the coercive field , the power losses and the noise . from the experimental point of view , it is possible to observe the domain structure on the surface of the sample by magneto - optical techniques , while the bulk behavior is accessible by inductive techniques .",
    "several models have been developed to understand the experimental results , ranging from ising type models considering the reversal of a set of interacting spins with @xcite or without disorder @xcite , to models focusing on the dynamics of a single domain wall @xcite .",
    "these two classes of models represent two extreme situations : spin models are appropriate when dipolar interactions are negligible . on the other hand , in soft magnetic materials",
    "magnetostatic effects induce wide parallel domain walls that determine the magnetization properties .",
    "the dependence of the hysteresis loop area on the frequency and the amplitude of the applied magnetic field is often referred to as dynamic hysteresis @xcite in the context of thin films and to power losses in bulk materials . in bulk materials ,",
    "energy dissipation is dominated by eddy currents propagation @xcite , while in thin films this effect is negligible .",
    "this led to the general belief that dynamic hysteresis in thin films is ruled by completely different laws than in bulk samples .",
    "the results of the models used to analyze dynamic hysteresis are often interpreted by assuming a universal scaling law for the dependence of hysteresis loop area @xmath0 on the temperature of the system @xmath1 , the applied field frequency @xmath2 and amplitude @xmath3 .",
    "the experimental estimates of the scaling exponents display a huge variability @xcite , and the validity of a universal scaling law is still under debate @xcite . in this respect , it was recently shown that the theory of loss separation developed for bulk materials could be equally well applied to thin films , since the precise nature of the damping ( i.e. eddy currents or spin relaxation ) does not change the basic equations  @xcite .    the barkhausen effect @xcite consists in the irregularity of the magnetization variation while magnetizing a sample with a slowly varying external magnetic field .",
    "it is due to the jerky motion of the domain walls in a system with structural disorder and impurities @xcite .",
    "once the origin of barkhausen noise ( bn ) was understood @xcite , it was soon realized that it could be used as a non - destructive and non - invasive probe to investigate the magnetization dynamics in magnetic materials . from a theoretical point of view , it is a good example of dynamical critical behavior , as evidenced by experimental observations of power law distributions for the statistics of the avalanche size and duration @xcite .",
    "there is a growing evidence that soft magnetic bulk materials can be grouped into different classes according to the scaling exponents values @xcite .",
    "the barkhausen noise is also an example of dynamics of a system presenting collective pinning when a quenched disorder is present , and it belongs to the family of the so - called crackling noises @xcite .",
    "this kind of noise is exhibited by a wide variety of physical systems , from earthquakes on faults to paper crumpling .",
    "so the relative ease to study crackling noise in magnets make the bn useful to get a deeper insight on different complex systems .    the most successful models used to describe the bn have considered the dynamics of a single domain wall @xcite , where the effect of the other domain walls is accounted for by an average demagnetizing field @xcite .",
    "this simplification is justified because the barkhausen noise is usually measured around the coercive field where the signal is stationary @xcite . in this regime , the domain walls are reasonably distant from each other and one can assume that their mutual interaction is negligible .",
    "the validity of this assumption , however , has never been established firmly : multi - wall effects may in principle affect the domain walls dynamics , and thus dynamic hysteresis and bn .",
    "even if we consider a single domain wall , its magnetostatic energy should depend on the number of the domain walls at least in an effective medium sense .",
    "in particular , the demagnetizing factor , that plays a crucial role in the bn statistics @xcite , should be correctly evaluated only considering the entire domain structure .",
    "an attempt to consider the effect of wall - wall interactions has been made using a spring - block model @xcite , but this model does not take correctly into account the long range nature of the dipolar interactions which underlie the multi - wall effects .    in this article , we consider a system with many rigid parallel bloch domain walls and study their motion , driven by an external ( triangular ) magnetic field , in a disordered material with strong in - plane uniaxial anisotropy .",
    "the model is based on the interplay between the dipolar and the external field contributions , in the presence of structural disorder .",
    "owing to the simplicity of the parallel bloch configuration , the magnetostatic energy can be treated analytically .",
    "we can calculate perturbatively the demagnetizing factor @xmath4 as a function of the structural and geometrical parameters of the system .",
    "the perturbative calculation perfectly agrees with the results of the simulations thus representing a link between a macroscopic measurable quantity and the microscopic dynamics of the system .",
    "moreover , dynamic hysteresis is investigated by integrating numerically the equations of motion of the domain walls .",
    "we analyze the behavior of the coercive field as a function of the applied field frequency , and of the disorder density and intensity .",
    "furthermore , with our model we can investigate the barkhausen noise .",
    "we find that the probability distributions for the size , the duration and the amplitude of the barkhausen avalanches show a power law behavior with a cutoff , in qualitative agreement with the available experimental data .",
    "these results show that multi - domain effects are in principle important , since they give rise to a non - trivial bn and modify the effective parameters ( e.g. the demagnetizing factor ) describing the motion of a single domain wall .",
    "a more complete treatment should involve the dynamics of a system of flexible parallel domain walls , but this goal is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows . in section [ model ]",
    "we present an overview on the energetics of films with parallel bloch domain walls , and we compute magnetostatic , disorder and external field contributions to the equations of motion of the domain walls . in sec .",
    "[ suscettivita ] we present the extended perturbative calculation of the magnetic susceptivity and the comparison with the simulation results .",
    "next , we present the results obtained by our simulations for the analysis of the dynamic hysteresis ( sec .",

    "our purpose is to study the motion of @xmath5 parallel bloch domain walls in a disordered ferromagnetic system , under an external magnetic field driving .",
    "the aim is to write an equation of motion for each wall and integrate the system of equations numerically . to this end",
    ", we calculate the total forces acting on the domain walls whose positions at time @xmath6 are described by the vector @xmath7 , as we are interested in the macroscopic response , we do not consider the details of the internal structure of the walls , and treat only the magnetostatic , the disorder and the external field contributions .",
    "thus the total force @xmath8 acting on the @xmath9-th wall at time @xmath6 is given by :    @xmath10    in equation ( [ etot ] ) , the magnetostatic term @xmath11 takes into account the interaction between the magnetization and the stray ( magnetostatic ) field generated by the magnetic charges due to discontinuity of the magnetization vector at the upper and lower boundaries of the sample , @xmath12 models the contribution of structural disorder , impurities , defects and so on , and @xmath13 describes the interaction between the magnetization and the external magnetic field . a detailed expression for eq .",
    "( [ etot ] ) is obtained by computing the energy @xmath14 for a generic configuration @xmath15 and then deriving it according to : @xmath16 in the following subsections we will discuss these terms in more detail .",
    "we consider a sample with total length @xmath17 , height @xmath18 and thickness @xmath19 , with @xmath5 domain walls displaced in the positions @xmath20 at time @xmath6 , separating @xmath21 domains of alternating magnetization .",
    "we consider a system with strong uniaxial in - plane anisotropy along the @xmath22 direction .",
    "the even domains have a magnetization equal to @xmath23 and the odd ones to @xmath24 , being @xmath23 the saturation magnetization of the material ( see fig . [ sample ] for a definition of the parameters ) . in order to calculate the magnetostatic contribution @xmath25 to the total force on the @xmath9-th domain wall at time @xmath6 ,",
    "we first compute the magnetostatic energy of the system @xmath26 for a generic arrangement of the walls and then derive it with respect to @xmath27 .",
    "the magnetostatic energy @xmath28 can be expressed in terms of the demagnetizing field @xmath29 as    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the magnetization vector and the integration is taken over the whole sample .",

    "in fact , the total number of domains in a sample is determined by the interplay of the magnetostatic term and the domain wall energy , linearly increasing as a function of @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "the magnetostatic force on the @xmath9-th wall at time @xmath6 is thus    @xmath57    @xmath58    @xmath59 , \\label{fmk}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath60    @xmath61    @xmath62    @xmath63    in fig .",
    "( [ forza ] ) we show the magnetostatic force @xmath25 calculated at each wall @xmath9 for a periodic configuration of @xmath64 domains .",
    "as it could be seen , walls with @xmath9 of opposite parities are driven in opposite directions , and the absolute value of @xmath25 is higher for the external walls , which is a finite size effect tending to reduce the size of the boundary domains . for a large odd number of domains , in the center of the sample ,",
    "all the @xmath25 would be equal in magnitude , as it can be seen in fig .",
    "( [ forza ] ) . for an even number of domains , the central wall experiences a zero force for symmetry reasons .",
    "as expected , for a generic ( even or odd ) number of domains , the effect of the magnetostatic force is to move the walls in the direction that decreases the magnetization , in order to minimize the magnetostatic energy [ see eq .",
    "( [ emagn ] ) ] .",
    "different sources of inhomogeneities are found in virtually all ferromagnetic materials .",
    "the presence of structural disorder is essential to understand the hysteretic behavior , and especially to account for the residual coercive field when the frequency of the external driving field vanishes .",
    "disorder is provided by vacancies , non - magnetic impurities , dislocations or grain boundaries in crystalline systems , variations of the easy axis between different grains for polycrystalline materials , and internal stresses for amorphous alloys .",
    "we consider here only quenched ( frozen ) disorder that does not evolve on the timescale of the magnetization reversal , which is usually a realistic approximation for ferromagnetic systems . at the beginning of a simulation ,",
    "we extract the positions of a fixed number @xmath65 of pinning centers with a uniform probability distribution all over the sample .",
    "each pinning center interacts with every domain wall by a located potential of the type    @xmath66,\\ ] ]    where @xmath67 is the distance between the pinning center and the wall , @xmath68 is a correlation length and the amplitude @xmath0 is extracted from a uniform distribution , considering that the strength of the pinning centers should vary for structural reasons . in this way we produce a disordered landscape in which the domain walls evolve .",
    "the interaction between a ferromagnetic system and an external magnetic field @xmath69 is described by the energy term :    @xmath70    in our model the uniaxial anisotropy and the external time dependent magnetic field @xmath71 are parallel to the easy axis of the sample , and thus parallel or anti - parallel to the magnetization .",
    "thus in this case the total energy is @xmath72 and the external field contribution @xmath13 to the force @xmath8 on the @xmath9-th wall at time @xmath6 is given by the partial derivative of eq .",
    "( [ intext ] ) with respect to the wall position @xmath73 , and could be thus written as    @xmath74    which depends of course on the parity of the domain wall .",
    "an interesting analytical result that could be obtained from our model is the dependence of the demagnetizing factor @xmath4 on the number @xmath5 of the parallel domain walls .",
    "the parameter @xmath4 enters as a mean field term in several domain wall models used to describe the bn @xcite .",
    "its precise dependence on the sample geometry is usually approximated considering a uniformly magnetized sample and the domain structure is ignored .",
    "understanding this point is important since @xmath4 determines for instance the size dependence of the barkhausen avalanche distribution @xcite .",
    "the demagnetizing factor @xmath4 can be rigorously defined for uniformly magnetized ellipsoid from the relation @xmath75 . in more general situations ,",
    "we can define it as an effective quantity linking the average demagnetizing field to the magnetization @xmath76 . here",
    "we compute @xmath4 from the magnetic response of the system to a small perturbative external field . since at equilibrium",

    "the simulations are performed starting from a periodic configuration of a high and even number of domains , and letting the walls relax under an external field that is very low , in order to have a displacement from the equilibrium position of the walls of the order of some per cents of the distance between nearest - neighbor walls . to fulfill the hypothesis under which eq .",

    "hence , as expected , reducing the sample aspect ratio leads to an increase in @xmath4 .",
    "this fact has been exploited in ref .",
    "to tune @xmath4 and study its effect on the bn .",
    "in the previous sections we have calculated the various contributions to the total force acting on each wall ( eq . [ etot ] ) thus it is now possible to simulate the dynamics of the system . since the number of the walls is @xmath5 , and we consider in this part closed boundary conditions ( the boundary walls do not move ) , we have to write down @xmath93 equations of motion given by @xmath94 in the following we set the damping coefficient @xmath95 to unity .",

    "we always start our simulations with an @xmath97 at @xmath98 periodical configuration , and drive the sample to positive and then to negative saturation .",
    "we include the possibility of nucleation and annihilation of the domain walls by fixing a minimum interaction range between two nearest - neighbor walls , namely @xmath99 .",
    "if two walls get closer than @xmath99 , we stop them and consider the pair of walls as annihilated .",
    "this means that their contribution on the sum involved in the calculation of long - range magnetostatic force ( see eq .",
    "[ fmk ] ) , and thus their effect on the equations of motion of the other walls , is no more considered .",
    "besides , we go on calculating the total force on the annihilated pair of walls . when this force become strong enough ( and of the correct sign ) to let them escape from the range @xmath99 , we nucleate them and consider again their contribution to the magnetostatic force calculation , eq . [ fmk ] .",
    "this corresponds to have a nucleation barrier equal to zero .",
    "since we are interested in the study of barkhausen noise and of the coercive field behavior connected to dynamic hysteresis , this choice does not influence our results , as we have checked .",
    "in fact , all the phenomena that we are interested in take place in the central region of the hysteresis loop , namely the one close to the coercive field @xmath100 , while the choice of the nucleation barrier involves only the region of the cycle close to saturation .",
    "moreover , for the same reason , our results are independent on the choice of @xmath99 , as long as it is chosen in a reasonable range .",

    "hence we will expect , from this simple argument , that more disordered systems have larger hysteresis loops compared to purer specimens , for the same @xmath2 .",
    "c +    we remind here that it is difficult to quantify the disorder contribution in real systems . in our model",
    "we have two degrees of freedom to control the disorder : we can tune the density of pinning centers ( by controlling the total number of pinning sites @xmath65 ) and their strength @xmath106 .    in fig .",

    "[ 2dis ] , we show the coercive field behavior for increasing disorder , intended here as increasing both the values of @xmath65 and @xmath106 : as expected , stronger disorder implies higher coercive field .",
