    "although the standard model ( sm ) for particle physics has been successful for over three decades , it still shows some problems which solutions could imply physics beyond its scope  @xcite .",
    "recently , the atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite experiments at lhc have discovered a new neutral boson with properties consistent with those of the sm higgs boson  @xcite . with the experimental progress at lhc",
    ", it is of great interest to confirm whether this boson is the only one fundamental scalar just as the sm , or belongs to an extended scalar sector responsible to the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) .",
    "the simplest scenario entertaining the latter possibility is provided by the two - higgs doublet models ( 2hdm ) .    besides the sm higgs sector",
    ", an additional higgs doublet is introduced in the 2hdms .",
    "this class of models can provide new source of cp violation beyond the sm  @xcite , which are needed to explain the observed cosmic matter - antimatter asymmetry .",
    "the 2hdms could also be understood as an effective theory for many natural ewsb scenarios , such as the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite .    however , unlike the sm , the tree - level flavour - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) transition in the 2hdm is not forbidden by the glashow - iliopoulos - maiani ( gim ) mechanism .",
    "these fcncs can cause severe phenomenological difficulties  @xcite . besides some other solutions @xcite",
    ", this problem can be addressed by imposing a discrete @xmath9 symmetry  @xcite . according to different @xmath0 charge assignments , there are four types of 2hdms , referred to , respectively , as the type - i , type - ii , type - x and type - y 2hdms  @xcite . therefore , phenomenologically distinguishing between these 2hdms is an important issue and worthy of detailed investigation  @xcite .",
    "the 2hdms present very interesting phenomena in both low - energy flavour transitions such as @xmath10 decay and @xmath1 mixing , and high - energy collider processes such as various higgs decay channels . at present , many analyses have been performed @xcite , however , most of them concentrate on the type - ii 2hdm . in this work , we shall extend the previous analyses and study the possibility to discriminate the four different types of 2hdm in favor of experimental measurement . to constrain the model parameters ,",
    "we shall consider the following constraints :    * flavour processes : @xmath1 mixing , @xmath11 , @xmath3 and @xmath12 decays , * direct search for higgs bosons at lep , tevatron , and lhc , * perturbative unitarity and vacuum stability .    for the @xmath13 decay ,",
    "there are several interesting observables very sensitive to new physics effects as suggested recently by _ de bruyn et al_.  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we use these observables to probe the 2hdms and find the correlation between the mass eigenstate rate asymmetry @xmath5 and the ratio @xmath14 , which could be used to discriminate the four models with future precise measurements of the observables in the @xmath8 decay at lhcb .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we give a brief review on the 2hdm with the @xmath0 symmetry . in section  [ sec : flavourobservable ] , the theoretical formalism for the flavour observables are presented . in section  [ sec : numericalanalysis ] , we give our detailed numerical results and discuss the possibility of discriminating the four types of 2hdm .",

    "in the 2hdm , the two higgs doublets @xmath15 and @xmath16 can be generally parameterized as @xmath17 for a cp - conserving higgs potential , the two vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) @xmath18 and @xmath19 are real and positive  @xcite .",
    "they satisfy the relations @xmath20 and @xmath21 with @xmath22 .",

    "the yukawa interactions of these higgs bosons can be written as @xmath31 where @xmath32 with @xmath33 the pauli matrix , @xmath34 and @xmath35 denote the left - handed quark and lepton doublets , and @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the right - handed up - type quark , down - type quark and lepton singlet , respectively .",

    "besides the experimental constraints mentioned in previous sections , there are theoretical conditions which allow one to restrict the 2hdm parameter space  @xcite .",
    "the vacuum stability  @xcite arises from the requirement that the higgs potential must have a minimum . the perturbative unitarity  @xcite is the condition that all the ( tree - level ) scalar - scalar scattering amplitudes must respect unitarity . from these conditions ,",

    "if this range overlaps with the @xmath62 range of the experimental measurement , this point is regarded as allowed . in this procedure , to be conservative , the theoretical uncertainty is taken as twice the one listed in table  [ tab : smandexperiment ] .",
