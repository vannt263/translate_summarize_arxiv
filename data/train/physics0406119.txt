    "frictional sliding along an interface between two rapidly deforming solids is a basic problem of mechanics that arises in a variety of contexts including moving machinery surface interaction ( both macro and micro machines ) , material processing ( e.g. cutting ) , the failure of fiber reinforced composites ( e.g. fiber pullout ) and earthquake dynamics ( fault rupture ) .",
    "however , a framework for quantifying the wide range of observed dynamic frictional phenomena is only beginning to emerge . the classical amontons - coulomb description of friction states that the shear stress at an interface is proportional to the normal stress , with the coefficient of proportionality being the coefficient of friction .",
    "two coefficients of friction are identified ; a static coefficient of friction that governs the onset of sliding and a dynamic coefficient of friction that characterizes the behavior during sliding .    at the microscale , an evolving population of deforming and fracturing contacts , possible phase transitions and the presence of various lubricants play an important role in setting the static and dynamic coefficients of friction as well as in governing the transition between them .",
    "rate and state models of friction aim at incorporating the effects of these microscale processes through appropriately chosen state variables , e.g. dieterich ( 1979 ) , ruina ( 1983 ) , rice and ruina ( 1983 ) , linker and dieterich ( 1992 ) , prakash and clifton ( 1993 ) , and prakash ( 1998 ) .",
    "rate and state models of friction have come to the fore because they substantially influence the predicted mode and stability of sliding .",
    "of particular interest is whether sliding occurs in a crack - like mode in which the surfaces behind the leading edge of sliding continuously slide or in a pulse - like mode , first proposed by heaton ( 1990 ) , in which sliding occurs over a relatively small propagating region .",
    "one significance of the sliding mode is that the calculated frictional dissipation in the pulse - like mode is significantly less than in the crack - like mode and is consistent with some values of heat generation inferred from geophysical field measurements ( heaton , 1990 ) .",
    "the classical amontons - coulomb description of friction is inadequate for addressing fundamental issues of sliding along interfaces between elastic solids because with amontons - coulomb friction sliding along such an interface is unstable to periodic perturbations for a wide range of friction coefficients and material properties , with a growth rate proportional to the wave number ( renardy , 1992 ; adams , 1995 ) .",
    "when generalized rayleigh waves exist , ranjith and rice ( 2001 ) found that there are unstable modes for all values of the friction coefficient .",
    "mathematically , instability of periodic perturbations renders the response of a material interface with amontons - coulomb friction ill - posed .",
    "physically , it implies that during sliding energy is transferred to shorter wave lengths , leading to pulse sharpening and splitting .",
    "numerically , the splitting of individual pulses creates an inherent grid - size dependence ( andrews and ben zion , 1997 ; ben zion and andrews , 1998 ) .",
    "ranjith and rice ( 2001 ) showed that an experimentally based rate and state dependent friction law ( prakash - clifton , 1993 ; prakash , 1998 ) , in which the shear strength in response to an abrupt change in normal stress evolves continuously with time , regularizes the problem .",
    "convergence through grid size reduction is then achieved ( cochard and rice , 2000 ) .",
    "although rate- and state - dependent frictional laws provide regularization , slip pulses may still grow with time .",
    "perrin et al . ( 1995 ) and zheng and rice ( 1998 ) found from anti - plane strain ( mode - iii ) calculations conditions on the frictional law and the loading conditions needed for well - posedness .",
    "they also found that under certain conditions , which include the rate of steady state velocity weakening , sliding can be partially crack - like and partially pulse - like .",
    "ben - zion and huang ( 2002 ) numerically analyzed a configuration of two identical solids separated by a variable - width fault zone layer and assumed constant external compressive and shear fields .",
    "they showed that the friction law used by ranjith and rice ( 2001 ) and cochard and rice ( 2000 ) regularizes the adams instability for identical as well as for dissimilar materials .",
    "the same conclusion was reached analytically by rice et al .",
    "the use of rate and state dependent friction not only regularizes the ill - posedness of the sliding problem but can also eliminate supersonic propagation ( rice et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "however , the physical reason for excluding supersonic propagation is not clear .",
    "the issue of limiting propagation speeds arises in the dynamic fracture mechanics of growing shear cracks ( freund , 1998 ; broberg , 1999 ; rosakis , 2002 ) which has many similarities with the frictional sliding process .",
    "early analytical and numerical studies of intersonic shear crack growth using continuum slip weakening ( burridge , 1973 ; andrews , 1976 ; broberg , 1995 , 1996 ) and velocity weakening cohesive zone models ( samudrala et al",

    "of particular relevance to the present study is the persistent occurrence of intersonic shear rupture along interfaces between identical solids which was first observed experimentally by rosakis et al .",

    "oscillations occur in @xmath54 along the interface , with the highest peak near the sliding tip and decreasing in amplitude behind the tip .",
    "when sliding has progressed about 50 mm along the interface , the amplitude of the first three oscillations is large enough for @xmath54 to vanish at the crests leading to sticking regions ( however the maximum value of @xmath54 generally remains a small fraction of an elastic wave speed ) .",
    "the amplitude of the following oscillations is much smaller and sticking does not occur .",
    "thus , we obtain a crack - like sliding region following three slip - pulses of decreasing magnitude .",
    "other loading combinations of @xmath260 and @xmath154 on the transition line in fig .",
    "[ fig19 ] , lead to similar oscillations in the slip rate or to unsteady behaviors , such as mixed crack - like and pulse - like sliding modes that evolve with both time and distance .",
    "this behavior is reminiscent of that found in the analysis of spring - slider system obeying a rate- and state - dependent friction law ( ruina , 1983 ; gu et al . , 1984 ) where it was shown that the transition from steady sliding to stick - slip goes through several oscillations , period doubling and self - sustained periodic oscillations .",
    "gu and wong ( 1991,1994 ) also found this transition to be dependent on the load point driving velocity in addition to the stiffness and constitutive parameters .",
    "the experiments and calculations for symmetric loading with no sliding , permit the features of the response associated with sliding to be identified .",
    "also , the good agreement between the experiments and the calculations for symmetric loading provides confidence that the wave propagation aspects of the experiments are well - represented in the calculations .",
    "features that are common between the symmetric loading experiments and the corresponding calculations include the cusp in the photoelastic fringes at the interface , the formation of a head wave emanating from the loading wave front and the distortions in the photoelastic stress field behind the loading wave due to the trapezoidal nature of the input .    a guideline for assessing mesh resolution ( zheng and rice , 1998 ) is that the mesh spacing ( @xmath263 mm along the interface in the uniform mesh region ) should be significantly less than a characteristic length , @xmath264 , associated with the friction law , @xmath265 \\vert\\ ] ] where @xmath266 is the shear modulus and @xmath267 is the shear stress under steady state sliding .",

    "iv , where the normal stress is @xmath272 mpa and @xmath54 ranges from about 10 m / s to 100 m / s , the minimum value of @xmath264 is @xmath273 mm and for much of the velocity range is significantly greater than that . it is worth noting that it is for case iv that a supersonic pulse is obtained . for the other cases",
    ", @xmath264 typically has values between those for cases i and iv .",
    "several calculations were carried out to assess the mesh dependence of the results . for case i ( crack - like mode ) and for case iii ( pulse - like mode ) , calculations were carried out with the mesh spacing halved along the interface ( 0.15 mm in the uniform region ) so that the number of elements was doubled .",
    "for case i , with the finer mesh the transition region at the sliding tip consisted of four elements ( sixteen integration points ) as opposed to two elements ( eight integration points ) with the coarser mesh .",

    "the mean values of the curves of @xmath175 versus time computed using the finer mesh also essentially coincide with the curves in fig .",
