    "the bright far - infrared source , g240.31 + 0.07 ( hereafter g240 ) , at a distance of @xmath11 ( macleod et  al . 1998 ) , is known to harbor an ultracompact ( uc )  region associated with @xmath1 and oh masers ( migenes et  al .",
    "1999 ; caswell 2003 ) .",
    "the flux density at 100  suggests a luminosity of @xmath12 , consistent with a spectral type o8.5 zero - age main sequence ( zams ) star ( macleod et  al .",
    "observations with the very large array ( vla ) detected a point source with radio free - free emission corresponding to ionization by a zams b0.4 star ( macleod et  al .",
    "1998 ) . on the large scale ,",
    "the co  ( 1 - 0 ) emission exhibits broad line wings up to @xmath13 , possibly tracing a bipolar outflow ( shepherd & churchwell 1996 ) . with improved angular resolution of 20 , hunter ( 1997 ) resolved the co  ( 3 - 2 ) emission and found a prominent bipolar outflow at a position angle ( p.a . ) of 138  and a possible second outflow axis at @xmath14 .",
    "each of the two bipolar outflow extends roughly 80  in length .",
    "subsequent infrared study found two bright , elongated h@xmath15 emission features within 16   ( 0.5  pc ) of the uc  region ( fig .",
    "[ 654cont ] ; kumar et  al .",
    "kumar et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) analyzed emission lines of @xmath10 and [ feii ] and concluded the h@xmath15 emission being a result of non - dissociative @xmath16-shocks .",
    "the @xmath17 emission , from @xmath18 to @xmath19 , shows a linear velocity gradient of @xmath20 along the h@xmath15 axis with a 33  beam .",
    "the authors further argued that the h@xmath15 emission features arise in a rotating disk or envelope around g240 .",
    "using single - dish telescopes , millimeter and submillimeter observations toward g240 can not resolve structures smaller than 12 .",
    "interferometric observations with high angular resolutions are crucial to investigating the linear velocity gradient seen in the @xmath17 emission .",
    "our current study is enabled by the submillimeter array(sma ) ( ho , moran , & lo 2004 ) with its highest frequency band at 654  ghz .",
    "dust continuum emission and the higher transition of @xmath8 ( @xmath21 ) should better trace warm components in this region . moreover , the temperature and the dust properties can be studied by combining the simultaneous observation in the 223  ghz band .",
    "the observation was carried out on feburary 16 , 2005 , using 6 elements of the sma in the dual - band mode , which allows simultaneous operation of the 223 and 654  ghz receivers .",
    "the phase center was toward ( @xmath22)(j2000 ) .",
    "the observing cycle comprised scans of 0736 + 017 , titan , vy  cma , and g240 , and was repeated every 25 minutes .",
    "the total on - source integration time was about 80 minutes for g240 .",
    "data inspection , bandpass and flux calibrations were done within the idl superset mir .",
    "the jovian moon , callisto , was used to calibrate the passband as well as the flux density scale .",
    "the flux measurements should be accurate to within 30% and 15% at 654 and 223  ghz , respectively .",
    "details of the observations are listed in table  [ t1 ] .    a major difficulty for interferometric imaging at 654  ghz is the lack of sufficiently strong quasars that can be used to derive complex gains .",
    "our strategy is to utilize the nearby ( 5  away from g240 ) @xmath1 masers at @xmath23 ( menten & young 1995 ) in vy  cma to trace atmospheric phase fluctuations .",
    "the @xmath1 masers were observed in the same sideband with the @xmath24 transition .",
    "calibration of the 654  ghz band was done in two steps .",
    "first , phase - only gain solutions were derived from the @xmath1 masers , whose flux density , however , may change on the timescale of a few hours due to its possibly polarized and highly variable nature . without a stable flux density ,",
    "the masers can not be used for gain amplitude calibration .",
    "instead , we examined the continuum emission of vy  cma and found it to be a structureless source of 7  jy with a @xmath0 beam .",
    "the peak position of the continuum emission agrees with the maser spot to within 006 , significantly smaller than the beam .",
    "we therefore derived complex gains from the continuum emission of vy  cma to correct temporal amplitude variation .",
    "gain solutions from the two steps were then multiplied together and applied to the other sources . judging from the peak poisitons of titan ( 40  away ) and",
    "0736 + 017 ( 20  away ) , we estimated the astrometry should be good to within 03 .",
    "both sidebands , each of a 2  ghz bandwidth , were used to generate a line - free continuum map in a multi - frequency synthesis , resulting a frequency equal to the average of the upper and lower sideband frequencies .",
    "imaging was performed with the miriad package .",
    "calibration of the 223  ghz band followed the conventional process by solving complex gains against the quasar 0736 + 017 , whose flux density was assumed to be 1.9  jy .",
    "the gain solutions were then transferred to the other sources .",
    "a line - free continuum map and channel maps of g240 were generated with uniform weighting .",
    "the 654  ghz continuum emission of g240 is resolved into two clumps ( fig .",
    "[ 654cont ] ) , with clump a coincident well with a vla 6  cm point source ( hughes & macleod 1993 ) and an @xmath1 maser . the newly discovered clump , b",
    ", is also associated with @xmath1 masers and is probably a more recent star - forming site ( codella et  al .",
    "the two sources may be responsible for the two bipolar outflows in @xmath25 emission ( hunter 1997 ) .",
    "the peak of clump  a is at ( @xmath26,@xmath27)(j2000 ) with @xmath28 while that of clump  b is at ( @xmath29,@xmath30)(j2000 ) with @xmath31 .",
    "the projected angular separation between the two peaks is @xmath32 , equivalent to @xmath33 , with a p.a . of 57 .",
    "no other continuum source is detected above the @xmath34 sensitivity of @xmath35 in the field of view .",
    "[ c18o ] shows the @xmath36 integrated intensity map and the spectra toward clump  a and b with gaussian fits .",
    "both clumps are associated with @xmath37 emission and show large gaussian linewidths attributed to nonthermal effects , e.g. turbulent motions .",
    "the spectrum toward each clump has a gaussian linewidth of roughly @xmath38 , much larger than the thermal linewidth of @xmath39 for a clump at @xmath40 .",
    "together with the geometric mean of 013 for the emission size , we estimate a virial mass of @xmath41 from the @xmath37 clump .",
    "the gaussian peak velocity of clump  a is @xmath42 , similar to the ambient velocity of @xmath43 in the @xmath44 emission ( shepherd & churchwell 1996 ) .",
    "clump  b is at @xmath45 based on our @xmath36 spectrum and was not detected in the previous @xmath46 observation with a larger 33  beam ( kumar et  al .",
    "furthermore , our observation does not detect a velocity gradient along the east - west direction as what has been seen in the large - scale @xmath46 emission .",
    "the kinematics at small scales ( @xmath47 ) do not follow the kinematics at large scales ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "formaldehyde ( @xmath6 ) possesses many transitions of greatly different excitation energies and is a good probe for kinetic temperature ( mangum & wootten 1993 ) .",
    "two @xmath6 transitions , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , with upper state energy levels of @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively , were observed in the 223  ghz band ( fig .",
    "[ fig_223lines]_e _ and [ fig_223lines]_g _ ) .",
    "we calculate an average temperature in the central @xmath53 region by comparing the mean integrated brightnesses of @xmath54 and @xmath55 in the @xmath49 and @xmath50 lines , respectively . assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) , the gas rotational temperature is about @xmath56 if both lines are optically thin .",
    "in addition to the two @xmath6 lines , other detected molecular lines are listed in table  [ table_223lines ] and velocity - integrated brightness maps are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_223lines ] . assuming lte and optically thin emission , we calculate the abundance for each species ( table  [ table_223lines ] ) .",
    "several lines , e.g. the two @xmath57 lines , are clearly affected by the lack of short baselines , suggesting that a significant fraction of the emission is diffuse .",
    "although the low angular resolution at 223  ghz can not spatially resolve the two clumps , two distinct kinematic clumps are well separated in velocity space in the @xmath58 and @xmath6 emissions . fig .",
    "[ fig_223lines]_j _ shows the position - velocity diagram of the @xmath6 emission as an example .",
    "the @xmath59 emission does not appear to be associated with extensive outflow activities ( fig .",
    "[ fig_223lines]_c _ ) .",
    "the derived abundance of @xmath60 is similar to the average ambient abundances of @xmath61 to @xmath62 in clouds with active star formation ( codella , bachiller , & reipurth 1999 ) .",
    "there is no clear evidence for @xmath63 abundance enhancement toward g240 due to outflow activities .",
    "the 223  ghz data indicate the presence of extended structure ( i.e. , a halo ) , as the visibility amplitudes increase with decreasing baseline length . to estimate the fluxes of the compact and extended components , we fit the visibilities with a",
    " core - halo \" model consisting of a point source and a one - dimensional gaussian .",
    "this decomposition gives 223  ghz flux densities of @xmath64 and @xmath65 for the core and halo , respectively , and a halo size of about @xmath66 .",
    "similar core - halo dust emission structures have been observed toward other massive star - forming regions ( su et  al .",
    "the 654  ghz data is not sensitive to this spatially extended halo . if the dust emission is optically thin , the continuum flux density @xmath67 , where @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 are the dust opacity at the observing frequency , @xmath72 , the dust mass , the planck function at a dust temperature , @xmath73 , and the distance to the source , respectively .",
    "the opacity spectral index @xmath74 can be measured by comparing flux densities at two frequencies . at 654  ghz ,",
    "the rayleigh - jeans approximation produces 15% error at a temperature of @xmath40 and is not applied to our calculation . because of different @xmath75 coverage at 223 and 654  ghz , we compare flux densities in maps made with visibilities of projected baselines within @xmath76 , the range that the two frequencies have in common and corresponds to the compact component within the halo .",
    "the flux densities at 223 and 654  ghz are @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively , and imply that @xmath3 , smaller than the canonical value of @xmath79 in the interstellar medium and in cold , massive cores ( hill et  al .",
    "small values of @xmath80 have been observed toward several massive star - forming regions ( chen et  al .",
    "2006 ; beuther et  al . 2004 ) and may be attributed to grain growth or merely a feature of high - density environment ( chandler et  al .",
    "1995 ; draine 2006 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "a small @xmath80 can also be a result of the opacity at 654  ghz becoming important . assuming a dust opacity of @xmath81 ( hildebrand 1983 ) , the peak intensity of @xmath28 at clump  a corresponds to a dust column density @xmath82 , translating to an optical depth @xmath83 .",
    "hence , the observed small @xmath80 is not due to large opacity at 654  ghz .",
    "the dust mass can be calculated with @xmath84 by assuming thermal equilibrium between dust and gas and a 223  ghz dust opacity @xmath85 .",
    "hence , the total nebular mass is about @xmath86 if the gas - to - dust ratio is @xmath87 ( savage & mathis 1979 ) .",
    "the estimated virial mass of @xmath41 ( sec .  [ sec_c18o ] ) is found to be slightly larger than the nebular mass .",
    "the cloud may be marginally self - gravitationally bounded or under additional pressure exerted by the outer halo .",
    "the free - free emission of a zams b0.4 star accounts for the minimum stellar mass of @xmath88 ( hanson , howarth , & conti 1997 ) .",
    "therefore , the enclosed mass in the central region should be about @xmath89 . given the radial velocity difference @xmath90 and the projected separation @xmath91 , the minimum mass required to hold the two clumps in orbit about each other will be @xmath92 .",
    "the total ( nebular and stellar ) mass in the central region is close to , but not by far larger than , the minimum mass required for the two clumps to be in binary rotation .",
    "we can not rule out the possibility of the two clumps being members of a wide binary system .",
    "studies of the spectral energy distribution suggested about @xmath93 of matter , mostly in the halo , associated with g240 ( kumar et  al .",
    "the two clumps in the central region should be bound inside the gravitational potential well generated by the massive halo .",
    "neither of our continuum maps shows elongated structures corresponding to the @xmath10 knots that have been proposed to trace a disk or envelope ( kumar et  al .",
    "assuming typical conditions @xmath94 and",
    "@xmath95 for a disk ( mannings & sargent 1997 ) , we use the 223  ghz continuum sensitivity to place an upper limit on the visual extinction , @xmath96 , for this hypothesized disk .",
    "the @xmath97 level of @xmath98 corresponds to @xmath99 within a beam .",
    "the lack of continuum emission suggests that the visual extinction toward the @xmath10 knots should be no larger than @xmath100 .",
