    "the origin of the galactic electron - positron annihilation radiation remains problematic ever since the original detection of its characteristic 511 kev line ( e. g. diehl et al .",
    "2006 and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , recent observations of the line intensity and spatial morphology with the spi instrument aboard integral put severe constraints on its origin , since it appears that 1.5@xmath00.1 10@xmath1 /s are annihilated in the bulge alone and 0.3@xmath00.2 10@xmath1 /s in the disk , i.e. that the bulge / disk ratio of annihilating positrons is @xmath23 - 9 ( kndlseder et al .",
    "2005 ) .    in a recent work , weidenspointer et al .",
    "( 2008 ) find a significant asymmetry in the disk emission ( factor 1.7 between positive and negative latitudes).they also find that the observed distribution of low - mass x - ray binaries in the hard state has a remarkable similarity to the 511 kev longitude profile ; they suggest then that those objects may be the main sources of positrons in the disk , with a sizeable ( but certainly insufficient ) contribution to the bulge emission .    in this short review ,",
    "i discuss the galactic positron sources in the light of recent developments .",
    "i argue that , _ if _ it is assumed that _",
    "positrons annihilate near their sources _ , then none of the proposed positron production sites , either conventional or `` exotic''ones , completely satisfies the observational constraints .",
    "furthermore , i argue that a large fraction of the disk positrons , produced by thermonuclear supernovae ( snia ) or other sources , may be transported via the regular magnetic field of the galaxy into the bulge , where they annihilate .",
    "this increases both the bulge positron annihilation rate and the bulge / disk ratio , alleviating considerably the constraints imposed by the spi / integral data analysis .",
    "in fact , i argue that the spi data are compatible with values of @xmath3 as low as 0.5 , because positrons can propagate away from their sources and fill a rather large volume ( of low surface brightness ) , much larger than the relatively thin disks adopted in the analysis of spi data . this property is crucial to the success of the scenario proposed here , which depends also on the poorly known properties of the galactic magnetic field . in any case , the issue of positron propagation in the ism and the magnetic field of the galaxy appears to be crucial for our understanding of the 511 kev emission .",
    "thermonuclear supernovae ( snia ) are prolific e@xmath4 producers , releasing on average 3 10@xmath5 positrons ( from the decay of @xmath60.7 of @xmath7co ) , but most of them annihilate inside the sn . assuming that @xmath8 positrons escape each snia and that the rate of snia in the galactic bulge and disk _ per unit stellar mass _ is @xmath9 ( given by observations of snia in external galaxies ) , one finds that the  production rate from radioactivity of snia is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the stellar mass of the system .",
    "@xmath8 is currently the major uncertainty of the problem .",
    "original estimates , based on late optical lightcurves of snia , gave @xmath128 10@xmath13 or an escaping fraction @xmath140.03 ( milne et al .",
    "1999).=0 ) _ in the framework of 1-d models for snia_. in \" canonical  1-d models , @xmath7co is produced and remains in the inner part of the snia .",
    "however , hydrodynamical 3-d models and recent observations ( tanaka et al . 2008 ) suggest that a sizeable fraction of @xmath15 may be found in the outermost , highest velocity layers , from which positrons may , perhaps , escape . in any case , the ( presently unknown ) configuration of the snia magnetic field is crucial for the issue of e@xmath4 escape . ] taking into account the masses of the mw disk and bulge , as well as the corresponding snia rates , this number leads to a positron emissivity @xmath16=1.95@xmath17 10@xmath1 /s for the disk and @xmath18=0.17@xmath19 10@xmath1 /s for the bulge ( see e.g. prantzos 2006 ) .",
    "those estimates suggest that the disk emissivity is slightly larger than the total galactic  annihilation rate required by spi observations , but it is much larger than the one of the bulge , contrary to observations .    in the case of the disk positrons ,",
    "a major source is undisputably the radioactivity of @xmath20al .",
    "the observed decay of the @xmath62  of @xmath20al per myr ( see diehl , this volume ) provides about 0.3 10@xmath1 e@xmath4/s , i.e. close to the value given by the latest spi data for the disk positron annihilation rate .",
    "however , the 1.8 mev map of @xmath20al does not show the degree of asymmetry claimed in weidenspointner et al .",
    "( 2008 ) for the disk 511 kev emission .    among the other astrophysical sources of positrons , x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) or some related class of objects ,",
    "appear as plausible candidates . low - mass xrbs ( lmxrbs ) were suggested in prantzos ( 2004 ) , who noticed that their observed longitude distribution in the galaxy is strongly peaked towards the central regions , not unlike the one of the 511 kev emision .",
    "he also noticed , however , that most of the strongest sources ( counting for 80% of the total galactic x - ray flux ) are evenly distributed in the galactic plane , with no preference for the bulge ; if their positron emissivity scales with ( some power of ) their x - ray flux , then lmxrbs can not be at the origin of the bulge galactic positrons .    according to weidenspointner et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , the observed asymmetry in the disk 511 kev emission matches closely the galactic distribution of lmxrbs in their hard state ( factor 1.7 in both cases between positive and negative galactic longitudes ) and this similarity suggests that disk positrons mostly originate from this particular class of compacts objects .",
    "it should be noted , however , that in all probability , at least half of the disk 511 kev emissivity is due to @xmath20al , which displays only a small degree of asymmetry . the remaining 511 kev emission ( i.e. once the @xmath20al contribution is removed ) is certainly even more asymmetric ( factor @xmath212.5 ) and no known source matches such an asymmetric profile ;",
    "thus , it seems premature to conclude that hard - state lmxrbs are at the origin of galactic positrons .",
    "finally , guessoum et al . ( 2006 ) find that another sub - class of xrbs , namely micro - quasars , are potentially interesting positron producers .",
    "altough it is not yet known whether their jets are loaded mostly with positrons or protons , theoretical estimates evaluate their individual positron emissivity up to @xmath610@xmath22e@xmath4/s . coupled with their estimated number in the milky way ( of the order of 100 ) ,",
    "that value suggests that micro - quasars may be interesting candidates .",
    "if the galactic snia positron emissivity evaluated in the first paragraph of this section is close to the real one , but the source of the observed bulge emission turns out to be different , it should then be a rather strange coincidence .",
    "we argue here that transport of disk positrons to the bulge through the galactic magnetic field may inverse the disk / bulge ratio of  annihilation rates",
    ". the arguments are valid for any other source producing positrons of @xmath61 mev , such as those resulting from radioactivity or x - ray binaries , or microquasar jets .",
    "positrons released in the ism ( especially in its less dense regions , like e.g. outside spiral arms or outside the thin gaseous layer ) propagate affected by the galactic magnetic field . the large scale regular magnetic field ( mf ) of the milky way is composed of a toroidal ( disk )",
    "component ( probably bisymmetric ) and a poloidal ( halo ) component , probably in the form of a a0 dipole ( see han 2004 and references therein also fig .",
    "1 ) . at galactocentric distance r=8 kpc",
    "the toroidal component has a strength of a few @xmath23 g ( beck et al .",
    "1996 ) and dominates the poloidal one ( a few tenths of @xmath23 g ) .",
    "however , the former varies as 1/r , while the latter as 1/r@xmath24 and should therefore dominate in the inner galaxy .",
    "positron propagation is strongly affected by the irregular ( turbulent ) component of the galactic mf , which is comparable in intensity with the regular one near the local disk .",
    "unfortunately , the properties of the irregular component away from the disk plane are even less well understood than those of the regular components ( e.g. han 2004 ) .",
    "prouza and smida ( 2003 ) assume that the turbulent component occupies 80% of the volume inside spiral arms , 20% of the volume outside spiral arms and within vertical distance @xmath251.5 kpc and only 1% of the volume at larger distances .",
    "on the other hand , cosmic ray propagation models indicate that the size of the cosmic ray `` halo '' ( crh , i.e. the region inside which cosmic rays diffuse on inhomogeneities of the magnetic field ) is @xmath26 kpc , based on measurements of unstable / stable ratios of secondary nuclei ( strong and moskalenko 2001 ) .",
    "if  escape from the crh then positron propagation at large distances from the disk will be dominated by the regular mf , i.e. the poloidal field . in those conditions , a fraction of the positrons produced from disk snia",
    "will ultimately find their way into the bulge .",
    "taking into account the spi data ( see sec . 1 ) and the snia emissivity of positrons in the disk and the bulge ( sec .",
    "2 ) it turns out that in order to explain the observed bulge annihilation rate by snia , the fraction of disk positrons channeled to the bulge must be @xmath270.5 , ( i.e. @xmath610@xmath1 /s from the disk have to join the 0.17 10@xmath1 /s produced in the bulge and annihilate in that region .     a representation of the poloidal magnetic field of the milky way in the x - z plane , _ assuming _ it is a a0 dipole .",
    "the central circle corresponds to the size of the 511 kev emitting region ( fwhm ) seen by spi aboard integral .",
    "the irregular ( turbulent ) magnetic field _ is assumed _ negligible outside the region between the horizontal lines ( _ dotted _ lines are suggested in prouza and smida 2003 , while _ solid _ lines are lower limits to the cosmic ray halo size suggested in strong and moskalenko 2001 ) ; positrons escaping from that region are presumably directed by the dipole field lines towards the bulge . ,",
    "scaledwidth=50.0% ]    this fraction may not be unreasonable .",
    "for instance , reacceleration of  by shock waves of snia may considerably increase the thermalization ( travel ) time of positrons @xmath28 . on the other hand",
    ", the positron confinement time in the disk may be shorter than the standard value of @xmath2910@xmath30 yr .",
    "the reason is that , because of their low energy ( and correspondingly low gyroradius in the galactic mf ) 1 mev positrons may diffuse very little on the density fluctuations of the mf , and thus they may escape more easily than the higher energy particles of standard galactic cosmic rays .",
    "these arguments are discussed further in prantzos ( 2006 ) , while jean et al .",
    "( 2006 ) find that low energy positrons may travel distances of several kpc in the hot , tenuous interstellar medium ( which dominates away from the disk of the milky way ) .",
    "in prantzos ( 2006 ) it is also argued that the snia disk positrons may not only leave the disk , but also enter the bulge by avoiding the `` magnetic mirror '' effect .",
    "the reason is that their velocity has a dominant component which is always parallel to the lines of the regular magnetic field of the galaxy .",
    "when positrons are still in the cosmic ray halo , they diffuse on the turbulent component of the mf at small scales , but at large scales their diffusive motion follows the regular ( toroidal ) component .",
    "the configuration of the galactic mf can vary only smoothly between the regions where the various components of the regular field ( toroidal in the disk and poloidal away from it ) dominate .",
    "the toroidal field changes smoothly into a poloidal one and positrons leaving the former enter the latter with a velocity essentially parallel to its field lines ; this minimizes the losses due to the mirror effect .",
    "simulated profile of the 511 kev emission of the milky way in galactic coordinates , as seen at three different levels of detector sensisitivity ( indicated in the bottom of each panel , in ph/@xmath31/s ) .",
    "the adopted composite model for the positron annihilation ( bulge + thin disk + thick disk ) is described in sec .",
    "3.,scaledwidth=95.0% ]    it is then concluded that 1 ) mev positrons produced in the disk may propagate away from it , and 2 ) they may also be chanelled to the bulge and annihilate there . in fig .",
    "2 we calculate the galactic gamma - ray profile from positron annihilation , as seen with three different levels of sensitivity ( appearing in the bottom of each panel ) .",
    "we assume that the milky way  annihilation rate results from i ) a bulge with annihilation rate l=1.2 10@xmath1 /s ( resulting from transfer of @xmath650% of the disk snia positrons plus those produced by the bulge snia population ) , ii ) a `` thick disk '' ( scaleheight 3 kpc ) from the remaining snia positrons , and iii ) a thin disk ( from positrons released by @xmath20al decay and annihilating in the thin gaseous layer ) .",
    "of course , such a symmetric model does not reproduce the small disk asymmetry reported in weidenspointer et al .",
    "( 2008 ) .",
    "we show quantitatively ( and with more details in prantzos 2006 ) that the spi / integral data are fully compatible even with bulge / disk ratio of  annihilation rates lower than 1 , provided that sufficiently ( but not unreasonably ) extended positron distributions are considered .",
    "we stress , in that respect , that positrons can be treated similar to radioactive particles ( since they have to slow down for a characteristic time @xmath28 before annihilating ) , so that _ the resulting 511 kev profile reflects essentially the distribution of propagated positrons _ and not the product of their density times the gas density .",
    "the model proposed here exploits a range of possibilities , given our poor understanding of the galactic magnetic field and of the propagation of low energy positrons in it .",
    "however , its assumptions may be tested , through future observational and theoretical developments .",
    "systematic multi - wavelength studies of snia , including the infrared , will determine ultimately the typical positron yield of those objects .",
    "a small 511 kev emission outside the bulge is currently seen by spi / integral and , given enough exposure , the spatial extent of that emission will be determined ( either by integral or by a future instrument ) ; an extended disk emission will prove that positrons travel indeed far away from their sources .",
    "finally , the morphology of the galactic magnetic field , and especially the presence of a poloidal component , will be put on more sound basis through further measurements ( e.g. han 2004 ) ."
