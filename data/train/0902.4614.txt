    "it has been realized in the recent years that a palette of nanocharacterization tools has to be employed in order to elucidate the origin of the surprising high - temperature ferromagnetism detected in a number of magnetically doped semiconductors and oxides.@xcite the application of state - of - the art analytic methods appears to reveal that the distribution of magnetic cations is generally highly non - uniform and that there is an ultimate relationship between the ion arrangement and the magnetic response of the system . in particular ,",
    "randomly distributed localized spins account for the paramagnetic component of the magnetization , whereas regions with a high local density of magnetic cations are presumably responsible for ferromagnetic features .",
    "it has been found that the aggregation of magnetic ions  driven by a substantial contribution of open @xmath4 shells to the bonding ",
    "leads either to crystallographic phase separation , i.e. , to the precipitation of a magnetic compound or an elemental ferromagnet , or to the chemical phase separation into alternating regions with higher and lower concentration of magnetic cations , occurring without distorting the crystallographic structure . in the literature on diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) , this chemical phase separation is commonly referred to as spinodal decomposition,@xcite independently of its microscopic origin .",
    "there are already experimental indications that the above scenario applies to the case of ( ga , fe)n fabricated by means of metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy ( movpe),@xcite where  depending on the growth parameters and on the fe concentration  fe is either randomly distributed over cation sites or non - uniformly incorporated , showing spinodal decomposition or the presence of precipitates that have been identified as hexagonal @xmath5fe@xmath1n , according to synchrotron radiation x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) and high - resolution transmission electron microscopy ( hrtem).@xcite moreover , by employing these nanocale characterization methods it has been found that the aggregation of fe cations is largely hampered by co - doping with si donors or mg acceptors.@xcite    in this work , we present results of x - ray absorption fine structure ( xafs ) spectroscopy@xcite carried out on ( ga , fe)n and ( ga , fe)n : si samples .",
    "xafs is a well established tool in the study of semiconductor heterostructures and nanostructures @xcite and has proven its power as a chemically sensitive local probe for the site identification of mn / fe dopants in iii - v dms,@xcite and of mn - rich nano - columns in ge.@xcite in the present case it allows us to obtain information on the local atom arrangement in the vicinity of fe ions as well as on the fe charge state , depending on the fe concentration , growth conditions , and co - doping .",
    "we then compare the experimentally determined bond lengths to the corresponding values expected from _ ab initio _ simulations .",
    "this combined experimental and computational effort makes it possible to identify the epitaxial parameters controlling the formation of @xmath0-fe@xmath1n precipitates in ( ga , fe)n . however , no presence of bonds specific to @xmath0-fe@xmath1n has been detected in the ( ga , fe)n films co - doped with si .",

    "these results are achieved by lsd calculations ; the lsd+u scheme is also tested with different u values in the range 25  ev and no appreciable difference are found between the lsd and lsd+u results .",

    "in the first series presented in this study the sample with a lower fe content exhibits two coordination shells around fe .",
    "these shells are identified as fe ",
    "ga contributions and the observed bond length values are in agreement with those calculated via dft for a fe ion in a ga - substitutional site .",
    "thus , we conclude that fe substitutes ga , as previously suggested by a qualitative analysis of exafs data.@xcite the closeness of the theoretical estimates of the fe ",
    "n distances reported in table  [ tab : dists]e makes it difficult to exploit the fe@xmath27 local geometry to distinguish between its possible , different charge states .",
    "however , the theoretical results support a deep acceptor character of fe@xmath27 and locate the corresponding electronic level in the upper half of the gan energy gap . accordingly , the @xmath81 formation energy is 0.40  ev lower in energy than @xmath80 in intrinsic gan , thus suggesting the presence of fe@xmath27 in the neutral state",
    ".    for samples grown with higher fe content an additional shell appears , matching a coordination at @xmath89   .",
    "this value coincides with the experimental and calculated fe ",
    "fe second shell distance in @xmath0-fe@xmath1n .",
    "this suggests that fe participates in the form of @xmath0-fe@xmath1n .",
    "it is worth noting that in this compound the first shell corresponds to the fe ",
    "n bonds exhibiting the same structural parameters ( length and number of neighbors ) as those specific to ga - substitutional fe in gan .",
    "these results provide an independent confirmation of our previous studies on ( ga , fe)n,@xcite according to which fe - rich nanocrystals were evidenced by neither hrtem nor hrxrd and a paramagnetic response was observed by squid in samples with a low - fe content , whereas samples with a high fe content showed the presence of fe - rich nanocrystals and a ferromagnetic behavior .    from a reduction in the amplitude of the dominating fe ",
    "ga signal relative to the pure substitutional specimen it is possible to estimate the relative content of fe in the two phases ( gan and @xmath0-fe@xmath1n ) , as shown in table  [ tab : dists ] . from these data",
    "we infer that the flow - rate of 200 sccm cp@xmath50fe corresponds to the onset of @xmath0-fe@xmath1n precipitation at our growth conditions , though the spinodal decomposition , that is the aggregation of fe cations without crystallographic phase separation may begin at lower fe contents .",
    "significantly , no presence of @xmath0-fe@xmath1n is detected in samples co - doped with si .",
    "it is worth to underline that no evidence is found for the @xmath56-fe phase that should be witnessed by a double fe  fe shell at 2.499 and 2.886  .@xcite actually , this phase was shown to be present only at the surface of samples grown under particular conditions@xcite and the overall fe fraction in this phase presumably lies below the detection limit of exafs ( about 15% in the present case ) .",
    "we also observe that our data do not point to the presence of fe in interstitial sites , at least in samples containing no secondary phases , for which the exafs signal is completely reproduced by a simple substitutional model . in the case of samples with precipitates ,",
    "their contribution could _ a priori _ mask a signal coming from interstitials .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of ( ga , mn)as where evidence for mn interstitials has been found in exafs studies.@xcite    turning to samples deposited at different growth rates we note that if the fe content exceeds the previously determined solubility limit , we find again the presence of @xmath0-fe@xmath1n nanocrystals in the film grown at the lowest rate ( tmga = 5  sccm ) . for faster growth rates ,",
    "however , the exafs spectra correspond exclusively to substitutional fe@xmath27 in gan , emphasizing the effectiveness of the fast growth in suppressing the formation of segregated phases .",
    "this observation is in qualitative agreement with the previous study,@xcite where hrtem carried out for samples grown at low and high rates ( although at a noticeably higher fe content ) revealed the formation of @xmath0-fe@xmath1n only for slowly grown specimens .",
    "the xanes spectral region is characterized by the presence of a single pre - edge peak at about 7114  ev in all samples grown without si . in agreement with the literature",
    "data@xcite this reveals that fe assumes the fe@xmath59 charge state in a tetrahedral environment , and this result corroborates the conclusions derived from previous electron paramagnetic resonance studies@xcite and from the present dft calculation for ( ga , fe)n .",
    "co - doping with si results in the appearance of an additional peak in the pre - edge region at about 7112.8  ev , which is attributed to fe@xmath60 ions in a tetrahedral environment , as already pointed out in our prior work.@xcite the fraction of the total fe content in this particular valence state is below 20 % , the majority of fe impurities still remaining in the fe@xmath59 configuration .",
    "this explains why we do not observe in the exafs data ( and , in particular , in the values of the fe ",
    "n bond length ) any significant deviation when comparing the samples containing no si impurities with the si - doped ones .",
    "however , the co - deposition of si hampers the aggregation of fe and , thus , shifts the solubility limit to higher fe concentrations .",
    "the above interpretation of the xanes findings is consistent with the _ ab initio _ results , implying that the fe@xmath60/fe@xmath59 state , i.e. the @xmath74 level , resides in the gan gap 2.25  ev above the top of the valence band .",
    "thus , this state should be occupied by electrons provided by shallow donors , such as si .",
    "this conclusion is further supported by the computed formation energy that results to be for the fe@xmath59 configuration by 1.35  ev higher than for the fe@xmath60 case .",
    "the present exafs results , together with previous hrtem , electron dispersive spectroscopy , and synchrotron xrd,@xcite show how the fe incorporation can be efficiently controlled by fe flow , growth rate , and co - doping with si .",
    "in particular , the aggregation of fe cations can be minimized by increasing the growth rate and by co - doping with si , shifting the solubility limit towards higher fe content at given growth conditions . while there is agreement between the present dft computations and both",
    "the previously @xcite and here observed fe charge state , including its evolution with the si concentration , a detailed understanding of how co - doping and other growth parameters affect the aggregation of fe ions awaits for a comprehensive theoretical treatment .",
    "a strict correlation between magnetic properties and the presence of fe - rich nanocrystals @xcite strongly suggests that the surprisingly robust ferromagnetism of ( ga , fe)n as well as of other diluted magnetic semiconductors and oxides deposited under specific growth conditions results from the self - organized assembly of magnetic nanocrystals , whose high blocking temperatures account for the survival of ferromagnetic features at high temperatures .",
    "this emerging insight provides a promising starting point for exploiting a number of expected functionalities of these nanocomposite semiconductor / ferromagnetic metal systems.@xcite .",
