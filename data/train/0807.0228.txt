    "in recent years , the potential impact of quasar outflows on their environment has become widely recognized .",
    "( e.g. , blandford & begelman 2004 ; scannapieco & oh 2004 ; vernaleo & reynolds 2006 ) .",
    "observationally , these outflows are detected as absorption troughs in quasar spectra that are blueshifted with respect to the systemic redshift of their emission line counterparts .",
    "the absorption troughs are mainly associated with uv resonance lines of various ionic species ( e.g. ,  @xmath12796.35,2803.53  @xmath11548.20,1550.77 ,  @xmath11393.75,1402.77  @xmath11238.82,1242.80 ) . a large spread in maximum velocity",
    "is detected for different quasar outflows : from several hundred  to more than 30,000 .",
    "outflow troughs are known as intrinsic absorbers to distinguish them from intervening and associated absorber , which are also detected in quasar spectra ( hamann et al.1997 ; and barlow 1997 ) .",
    "the lines we study here are intrinsic narrow lines ( see arav et  al .",
    "2002 for full discussion ) and are similar to the ones analyzed by de  kool et  al .",
    ".    reliable measurements of the absorption column densities in the troughs are crucial for determining almost every physical aspect of the outflows : the ionization equilibrium and abundances ; number density ; distance ; and mass flux and kinetic luminosity .",
    "column density measurements depend on the absorption model one adopts for the observed troughs in the spectrum .    in the case of interstellar medium ( ism ) and",
    "intergalactic medium ( igm ) absorbers ( the latter also known as intervening absorbers ) , the apparent optical depth method is an excellent absorption model .",
    "this method postulates that the absorber covers the full size of the emission source homogeneously and that the relationship between the the residual intensity in the trough ( @xmath2 ) and the optical depth of the line ( @xmath3 ) is give by @xmath4 .",
    "the derived @xmath3 is then converted to column density using a standard formula ( e.g. , equation 1 in arav et  al .",
    "2001a ) .",
    "however , our group ( arav 1997 ; arav et  al .",
    "1999a , 1999b ; de  kool et  al .",

    "( 2004 ) gabel et al .",
    "( 2005a ) ) and others ( barlow 1997 , telfer et  al .",
    "1998 , churchill et  al .  1999 ,",
    "ganguly et  al .",
    "1999 ) have shown that the apparent optical depth method , is not a good approximation for outflow troughs ( see also   3 ) .",
    "most of this evidence came from data sets that showed fully resolved troughs from unblended doublets ( e.g. , the , ,  and  lines mentioned above ) . for all these doublets ,",
    "the oscillator strength of the blue ( the shorter wavelength ) transition is twice that of the red transition .",
    "therefore , the expected optical depth ratio is 2:1 in favor of the blue transition .",
    "( it is not exactly 2:1 since the wavelengths differ by a small amount . ) for the apparent optical depth method to hold , we must have @xmath5(blue)=@xmath6(red ) which requires : @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the residual intensities of the blue and red absorption troughs , respectively .",
    "using high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) observations of fully resolved and unblended outflow doublets , it became clear that in most cases @xmath8 is significantly smaller than @xmath10 , demonstrating that the @xmath5 model is not applicable for agn outflows .    to avoid this contradiction for cases of unblended doublets",
    ", most works use a pure partial covering model to determine the real optical depth and hence the actual column density .",
    "this model assumes that only a fraction @xmath11 of the emission source is covered by the absorber and then solves for a combination of @xmath11 and @xmath3 that will fit the data of both doublet troughs while maintaining the intrinsic 1:2 optical depth ratio ( see   3 of arav et  al .",
    "2005 for the full formalism , including velocity dependence ) .",
    "the weakness in this method is that we solve for two unknowns ( @xmath11 and @xmath3 ) given two residual intensity equations .",
    "as long as the ratio of the residual intensities is in the permitted physical range ( see   3 of arav et  al . 2005 ) , such a procedure will always yield a solution .",
    "however , this is also the case for other two - parameter fitting algorithms , which yield different estimates of column densities .",
    "a main alternative to the pure partial covering model is the so called inhomogeneous absorber model ( de kool , korista & arav 2002 , hereafter dkka ; see   3.2.2 here ) .",
    "this model successfully matched the data of two quasar outflows ( dkka ) , while proving less applicable for the outflows troughs of mrk  279 ( arav et  al .",
    "2005 ; but see the discussion here ) .",
    "being able to distinguish between these two ( and other ) absorption models is important not only for column density measurements , but also for obtaining a more accurate geometrical picture of the outflow , including its internal structure . since doublet observations are inherently inconclusive in distinguishing between these methods ( or any other two parameter models ) , to resolve this issue we need data sets that show outflow troughs from more than two lines of the same ion .",
    "these troughs must be unblended , fully resolved and have a high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) .",
    "in this paper we present unprecedented high quality observations of a quasar outflow , which cover troughs from five  resonance lines associated with  uv multiplets 1 , 2 and 3 ( see   2.3 ) .",
    "we use the strong constraints available from these troughs to test models of absorption material distribution , and to determine the ionic column densities in all the troughs seen in this outflow .",
    "the object we targeted is the extensively studied broad absorption line ( bal ) quasar : qso 23591241 ( arav et  al .",
    "2001a ; brotherton et  al .",
    "having detailed knowledge of the existing keck / hires data , allowed us to tailor the new observations towards a definitive test for models of absorption material distribution . in future papers",
    "we will use these measured ionic column densities to determine the ionization equilibrium of the outflow , it s number density , distance and ultimately the mass flux and kinetic luminosity associated with the outflow .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in   2 we describe the observations , data reduction and the phenomenology of the outflow ; in   3 we test the goodness of the fit for the five  resonance lines obtained from different models of absorption material distribution ; in   4 we discuss our results , and in   5 we summarize them .",

    "2001a ) using the very large telescope ( vlt ) operated by the european southern observatory ( eso ) in fall 2006 ( see table [ observations_table ] below ) .",
    "the observations were done in service mode ( i.e. , done by the vlt staff at their scheduling , without active participation of the science team while the observations are taken ) using the uv - visual echelle spectrograph ( uves ) .",
    "all observations used a slit width of 1.0 arcsec . in order to cover the full wavelength range we used two uves settings .",
    "the observations taken in september 2006 used the following setting : wavelength centers blue=346 nm ( grating / filter = cd1/her5 ) , red=580 nm ( grating / filter = cd3/shp700 ) and the observations taken in october 2006 used : wavlength centers b=437 nm ( grating / filter = cd2/her5 ) , r=860 nm ( grating / filter = cd4/og590 ) .",
    "both settings were read out in 2 @xmath12 2 pixel - binned , high - gain mode . a table of the observations is given below .",
    "the useful spectral coverage was 32009000   compared to 43207450  for the keck / hires data .",
    "more importantly , the signal to noise of the vlt data , over the spectral range covering the five  resonance lines , was roughly 3 times higher , where both data sets have similar spectral resolution .",
    "this large increase in signal to noise allowed us to preform the analysis we present in this paper , which was not possible with the keck / hires data .",
    "the extraction of the spectra was done using the uves pipeline , which is based on echelle routines in the data reduction package midas .",
    "a detailed description of this process can be found in ballester et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "the uves data reduction pipeline gave excellent data products overall .",
    "however , one issue that produced considerable systematic errors are spectral undulations that were introduced by the pipeline .",
    "these undulations mimic narrow emission line structure in the data , with fwhm of about 10   and maximum flux of 20% above the adjacent continuum .",
    "it is clear that these are introduced by the reduction pipeline since we have overlapping spectral coverage over part of the affected range ( 47954950  ) and undulations appear only in one of the settings .",
    "the origins of these emission - line structures probably come from the bad columns located at the bottom of the lower red ccd chip ( private communication , cedric ledoux , uves instrument scientist ) .",
    "fortunately , the observed absorption troughs in that spectral region are considerably narrower ( about 3   full width ) than the fwhm of the undulations .",
    "therefore , we are able to model the undulations out of the data to a large extent ( see   2.2 ) . careful examination of the continuum fits in the overlapping spectral regions lead us to estimate a 23% maximum systematic error associated with these data reduction undulations .",
    "we note that the undulations affect less than 5% of the entire spectrum range , but unfortunately this includes the region of the important  uv 1 multiplet , which includes two of the  resonance lines under study here ( 2586.65and 2600.17 ) .",
    "each of the four exposures for a given setting and wavelength region were heliocentric corrected to vacuum wavelengths given by the fits header file .",
    "we then used a single multiplier value for each exposure such that all spectra had the same mean value .",
    "rejection of cosmic rays was done by replacing any flux value 3.5 sigma or more above the mean of the other 3 values and replacing it by that mean value . finally , the four different spectra were co - added via the weighted average at each data point based on the given error for the 4 different exposures .",
    "the fwhm of the spectral resolution was determined to be @xmath13  based on the weighted average of fitting 1 - gaussian profiles to the normalized flux of several atmospheric absorption lines . in view of this resolution , we chose to bin the data to 7.0 , which slightly over - sample the actual resolution , before normalization and analysis .",
    "the algorithm used to obtain a model for the unabsorbed continuum entails initially rejecting expected absorption lines a - priory from the line lists ( see table [ atomic_transitions_criteria ] ) .",
    "an initial cubic fit was applied over every spectral point ( pixel ) spanning 125 points on either side of a given spectral point .",
    "data points @xmath14 or more below the fit value were then rejected as absorption and the cubic fit was reapplied .",
    "this process of refitting and rejecting was reiterated at @xmath15 , @xmath16 and then @xmath17 .",
    "the chosen continuum at this spectral point was the value of the last cubic fit for that point .",
    "this process was repeated for all data points in the spectrum .",
    "the resultant continuum fit was smoothed with a boxcar average of five data points . to normalize the data",
    ", we then divided the observed flux values with this model continuum . for problem areas such as the data reduction undulations , atmospheric absorption regions , or wide / multiple absorption troughs , the parameters above",
    "were slightly altered to accommodate these areas , but the basic principle of fitting , rejecting and refitting remained the same . the only exception to this normalization process at the spectral vicinity of the  broad emission line ( bel ) where a pair of @xmath18 fitted gaussians were used to first divide out the  emission before normalization .",
    "the atomic transitions data used to identify spectral features , normalize the data ( see above ) and fit the absorption troughs ( see   3 ) came from morton ( 2003 ) for  transitions with lower energies ( @xmath19 ) below 1000 @xmath20 and from kurucz & bell ( 1995 ) for all other transitions .",

    "as stated in   1 , in order to extract quantitative information about the outflow , we need to measure the column density associated with the absorption troughs . in this section",
    "we test four models for the distribution of absorption material in front of the emission source , in order to find which one gives the best fit for the vlt data of qso 23591214 .",
    "the apparent optical depth method implicitly assume that the absorption material covers the source completely and homogeneously .",
    "that is , all light rays that arrive at the observer pass through material with the same optical depth at a given wavelength . under these assumptions , the residual intensity of a given line is @xmath41 . under these assumptions ,",
    "the optical depth ratio for two e=0 lines from the same multiplet is @xmath42 , where @xmath24 is the oscillator strength and @xmath33 is the wavelength of the transition . combining the two relations we derive the expected residual intensity of line 2",
    "given the observed residual intensity of line 1 : @xmath43    in figure [ fig_fe2_ap_tau ] we compare the residual intensities of the outflow troughs arising from two resonance lines ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) of the uv 1  multiplet , with the apparent optical prediction for @xmath46 based on @xmath47 ) , using the above relationship ( @xmath48 for this case ) .",

    "below , we describe three such models : partial covering , inhomogeneous absorber and a modified partial covering .        applying",
    "the apparent optical depth method is in essence using a one parameter model ( @xmath5 ) for fitting the absorption troughs ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "two parameter models are the obvious next step",
    ". most of the previous work , which addressed the inadequacy of the apparent optical depth method in modeling outflow troughs , dealt with data of unblended doublets ( e.g. , barlow 1997 ; arav et  al .",
    "1999a ; ganguly et  al .",
    "1999 arav et  al .",
    "2002 ; scott et al .",
    "the preferred method for modeling these troughs is the partial covering model , which is a two parameter model ( hamann et al .  1997 ; and barlow 1997 ) .",
    "to summarize this method : we assume that only a fraction @xmath11 of the emission source is covered by the absorber and then solve for a combination of @xmath11 and optical depth ( @xmath3 ) that will fit the data of both doublet troughs while maintaining the intrinsic 2:1 optical depth ratio ( see   3 of arav et  al .",
    "2005 for the full formalism , including velocity dependence ) .",
    "implicit in this model are the assumptions that the absorber covering the fraction @xmath11 of the source has the same optical depth across this area , and that the rest of the source is covered by material with @xmath49 in that transition .",
    "a geometrical illustration of this assumption is shown in figure [ optical_depth_distribution_paper_figure.ps ] .",
    "the partial covering model allows us to find a good fit for the doublet troughs and under the model assumption , a consistent determination of the optical depth and hence the column density of the trough .",
    "this is an important improvement over the apparent optical depth method , which can not yield a consistent optical depth estimates for the two troughs .    as stated in   1",
    ", the weakness of the partial covering model as applied to doublet troughs is that we solve for two unknowns ( @xmath11 and @xmath3 ) given the two residual intensity equations of the doublet troughs .",
    "as long as the ratio of the residual intensities is in the permitted physical range ( see   3 of arav et  al . 2005 ) , such a procedure will always yield a solution .",
    "therefore , a good fit is a necessary but not sufficient condition to validate the underlying model .",
    "in addition , other two - parameter models may fit the data equally well , where the most studied alternative are inhomogeneous absorption models      a more general way to modify the apparent optical depth assumptions , is to assume that the absorption material does not cover the source homogeneously . since there is an infinite number of ways of doing so",
    ", we need a quantitative model that can be directly compared with the partial covering results . the first attempt to study generic inhomogeneous distributions of absorbing material in agn outflows",
    "was done by de kool , korista & arav ( 2002 , dkka ) .",
    "a formalism was developed to simulate the effects of an inhomogeneous absorber on the emerging spectrum and several examples of fitting existing data with this model were presented .",
    "arav et al ( 2005 ) built upon this formalism and produced a two parameter inhomogeneous model that can be directly compared with the partial covering results . for full details we refer the reader to these two papers and here we give a brief description of the idea based on   2 of arav et al ( 2005 ) .",
    "our starting point is equation ( 6 ) from dkka :    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the surface brightness distribution of the background source and @xmath52 is the line of sight optical depth at wavelength @xmath33 in front of a specific @xmath53 location , as defined by dkka equations ( 3 - 5 ) .    in its most general form ,",
    "equation ( [ eq : general ] ) is not practical for modeling spectra .",
    "both @xmath51 and @xmath52 are unconstrained two variable functions for each given @xmath33 .",
    "we need a simpler and testable model . to this end",
    ", we introduce the following simplifying assumptions ( whose physical validity and plausibility are discussed in arav et  al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "1 .   @xmath54 , which can be set to @xmath55 when dealing with normalized data .",
    "@xmath56 , this simplifying assumption entails little loss of generality .",
    "we can think of @xmath57 as the integrated attenuated flux along a @xmath58 strip at a specific @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath60 , which yields a two parameter model that can be directly compared with the partial covering model .",
    "we note that a gaussian characterization also yields a two parameter model .",
    "however , these models were investigated by arav et al .",
    "( 2005 ; see their discussion of figure 3 ) and were shown to yield very similar results to power - law models .",
    "we therefore use the power law model as the sole representative of 2 parameter inhomogeneous absorption models .    with the last simplification we have a power - law inhomogeneous model where each of the two parameters ( @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) can be velocity dependent , similar to @xmath11 and @xmath3 for the partial covering model . in general , these two models have quite different physical interpretations , as will be discussed in   4 .",
    "the pure partial covering model is unphysical since there is a sharp edge ( essentially a step - function ) between a region with finite optical depth and a region with @xmath49 .",
    "physically , there need to be a transition zone between these two regions .",
    "this motivated us to add a parameter to the partial covering model which controls the gradient between these two regions .",

    "we show the optical depth distribution across the source for all four models .",
    "the examples we show are tailored to the best fits of each model to the  @xmath67 lines ( see   3.3 )      in order to test the partial covering and the inhomogeneous absorption models we need data sets that will over - constrain them , that is fitting more than two equations with the same two unknowns ( or three in the case of the modified partial covering model ) .",
    "to do so we need to observe more than two troughs from the same ion .",
    "our vlt / uves observations of qso 23591241 yield the best such data - set to date . in the outflow of this object we detect absorption troughs associated with more than 30 lines of the  multiplets uv 1 , uv 2 and uv 3 ( see figure 2 for the spectral region of the uv 1 multiplet ) .",
    "these lines include five transitions from the @xmath67 energy level , which in principle can give us five residual intensity equations to fit the two and three free parameters of the above models .",
    "to realize this possibility , we chose this target , s / n and spectral resolution , such that we would acquire an unprecedented data set for these purposes .",
    "the troughs are fully resolved , have s / n@xmath68 per resolution element and show only minor blending with other troughs , compared to other objects showing intrinsic troughs ( e.g. , wampler , chugai & petitjean 1995 ; de  kool et  al .",
    "2001 , 2002 ) .      in order to get a quantitative measure for how well each model fit the data , we use @xmath18 minimization . since the trough is well resolved , we binned the data to match the measured resolution .",
    "the resultant data product in the case of the  resonance lines are residual intensities for five @xmath67 lines covering the span @xmath69 to @xmath70 .",
    "each velocity bin is treated as an independent measurement and we use a least - squares @xmath18 minimization routine to find the best parameters of each model for that specific bin .",
    "the process is repeated for all velocity bins .",
    "two of the troughs suffer a moderate amount of blending with other lines and we omit the contaminated region of the individual trough while performing the fit .",
    "these contaminations occur for the  2600  trough between @xmath69 to @xmath71  and for the  2344  trough between @xmath72 to @xmath70 . as a result",
    ", we always fit at least four data points with each model , and five for the @xmath71 to @xmath72 , which includes the deepest part of the trough .",

    "figure 5 shows the best @xmath18 fit for each model , where for the sake of clarity we only show three of the five  @xmath67 lines detected in the spectrum .",
    "the fits were done using all five lines and those that are shown span the full range in oscillator strength . from both visual inspection and from the @xmath83 value , it is clear that the @xmath5 model gives a poor fit to the data .",
    "this is simply a more quantitative way to arrive at the conclusion shown in figure [ fig_fe2_ap_tau ] .",
    "the important results shown in figure 5 , are :    1 .",
    "both the pure partial covering and the power - law distribution models give similar fits ( with a small advantage to the power - law model ) .",
    "2 .   the modified partial covering model does not yield an improvement in @xmath83 value , although the fit itself is somewhat better .",
    "this surprising result will be discussed in   3.4 .",
    "before we compare the various fits and discuss how physical they are , we need to address the absolute @xmath83 values .",
    "normally we would expect the @xmath83 value of a `` good '' fit to be @xmath84 . for our leading two models",
    "we find @xmath85(pl)=3.8 , @xmath83(pc)=4.5 ( where pl stands for power - law and pc for pure partial covering ) .",
    "nominally , these values exclude these model at a very high probability . for a model with 60 degrees of freedom",
    "a @xmath86 has less than @xmath87 probability of being the correct model .",
    "however , the main issue here is the systematic errors that are not addressed by the fit .",
    "first , as was noted in   2 , the undulations superimposed on the spectrum due to data reduction issues can contribute a 23% systematic error in the normalized intensity of the troughs .",
    "the troughs that are most affected by these undulations ( 2600  and 2587 ) also have the highest s / n value per resolution element ( upwards of 80 ) . as a result",
    "this systematic error by itself can produce a @xmath88 , even if the model matches the data perfectly .",
    "another important source of systematic error is caused by uncertainties in the oscillator values of the  resonance lines .",
    "relative uncertainties between these values can produce a considerable @xmath83 on its own .",
    "we tested this hypothesis by artificially changing the oscillator strength for the weakest transition ( 2374  ) and found considerable changes in the @xmath83 values .",
    "for example , for the pl model , the value dropped from 3.8 to 3.4 when the oscillator strength of  2374  was increased by 40% .",
    "we therefore are not troubled by the fact that in this actual case we obtain @xmath88 and we focus our discussion on the differences seen between the different models .",
    "it will be left to future data sets , with better control of the systematics to show whether these models give reasonable absolute values of @xmath83 .",
    "as noted above , it became clear over the past 10 years that the simplest possible model ( @xmath5 ) is inadequate for modeling outflow troughs .",
    "our analysis here only adds a well constrained quantitative case to this effect . the next step is to compare between the two parameter models , namely the pure partial covering and the power law models .",
    "these models represent rather different physical pictures with regards to the distribution of absorbing material in front of the emission source .",
    "we will discuss their pros and cons in   4 , but as a first step it is useful to make a simple comparison of the fits to the same data by models with the same number of free parameters .",
    "we start by assuming that the main reason for the high absolute values of @xmath83 for these models are the systematic errors discussed above . by",
    "that we accept both models as being reasonable good fit for the data .",
    "the @xmath86 of the power law model is better than the @xmath89 of the pure partial covering model .",
    "however , assessing the significant of this difference in lieu of the large contribution from systematic error is more problematic , since it is difficult to predict what will happen to the relative differences between the @xmath85 once the systematics are better controlled . for the mean time we will cautiously accept the better fit of the power law model . as we will see below evidence from other  transitions and from other ions lends support to the better applicability of the power law model as well .",
    "it is also important to compare the velocity dependence of these models . for the partial covering model",
    "we find the known result that the covering factor traces the shape of the strongest modeled resonance line @xmath90 .",
    "this behavior is seen in most covering factor analysis of agn outflows ( e.g. , arav et al .",
    "1999b ; scott et al .",
    "2004 ) . for the power - law model",
    "we find that the lowest exponent is achieved at the point of lowest residual intensity .",
    "we also find that for velocities redwards of the lowest residual intensity the value of the exponent is modest @xmath91 , with errors of @xmath92% . at higher velocity",
    "the value of @xmath62 climbs to roughly 20 with 50% error typical ( 1@xmath93 errors based on the fitting process ) . for such high exponent values",
    "the absorption behavior of the power - law model becomes increasingly similar to that of the pure covering factor model .",
    "the technical reason for the high value of @xmath62 between @xmath94  as compared to the interval @xmath95 can be seen in figure [ fig_fe2_fit.eps ] .",
    "the intensity ratio of the strong to weak lines is considerably smaller at the @xmath94  interval compared to the @xmath96 interval .",
    "independent of a specific model , this behavior suggests a real difference in the physical behavior of the material in the two velocity intervals . under the assumption of the power - law model",
    ", a large exponent value can be interpreted as material spread in smaller concentrated entities , but at this stage such an interpretation is tentative at best .",
    "the modified covering factor model is an attempt to address the inherent unphysical nature of each of the above models . in the pure partial covering model",
    "there is an unphysically sharp edge ( essentially a step - function ) between a region with finite optical depth and a region with @xmath49 .",
    "physically , there should be a transition zone between these two regions .",
    "the modified covering factor model solves this issue by adding a parameter to the partial covering model which controls the gradient between these two regions . for the power law model , the entire region where @xmath97 yields virtually no flux .",
    "since the data require steep power laws with high values of @xmath98 , in some cases most of the material comes from the @xmath97 region ( see discussion in arav et al .",
    "it is disconcerting to have most of the material coming from regions that do not influence the spectrum much .",
    "the modified covering factor model allows for a gradual distribution of material , but caps @xmath98 at a physically reasonable value .",
    "however , for the qso  23591241 data set @xmath98 , the weakest  resonance line ( @xmath99 ) , has @xmath100 across the entire velocity range , except for two data points , where @xmath101 .",
    "therefore , there is no strong saturation at any point in front of the absorber ( not even at @xmath102 where @xmath103 ) .",
    "this maybe the reason why the modified covering factor model gives a worse fit for the data ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "that is , adding another degree of freedom was not necessary since the data could be reasonably fitted with a non saturated power - law . alternatively ,",
    "if most of the @xmath83 comes from systematic errors ( the normalization of the effective continuum and/or oscillator strength issues discussed in   3.2 ) we will expect a higher @xmath83 when the numbers of free parameters is increased .",
    "this is because while the @xmath18 does not change much , the number of degrees of freedom drops considerably . in this actual case , the denominator of equation ( [ eq : red_chi2 ] ) changes from 65 to 40 , while moving from a 2 to 3 parameter fit , predicting an increase of 62% in @xmath83 for the same @xmath18 value",
    "this is almost exactly the excess in @xmath83 for this fit compared with that of the power - law model .",
    "it is therefore possible that the statistical fit of this of the modified covering factor model will improve enough to make it a good candidate for modeling the absorption material distribution , once the systematic errors are under better control .",
    "figure [ fig_fe2_col.eps ] shows the extracted column density of the  e=0 level for component * e * of the outflow ( @xmath105 ) , for all four methods .",
    "the column densities shown are the average value across the emission source at each velocity bin .",
    "for example , for the pure partial covering , we multiply the extracted column density by the covering factor ( @xmath106 ) , since the model assumes that only a @xmath106 of the emission source is covered by the absorbing material .",
    "several important conclusions can be drawn from figure [ fig_fe2_col.eps ] .",
    "first , the column density derived from the @xmath5 model is roughly a factor of 3 lower than those derived by the other methods .",
    "not only the @xmath5 model inapplicable to agn outflow troughs , it also severely underestimates the column density .",
    "second , the inferred column density for the pure covering factor and power - law methods differ by only 25% . although these models may suggest a rather different physical picture of the absorbing material , this quantitative similarity shows that the ionization equilibrium results based on their modeled column density will be quite similar .",
    "furthermore , this last conclusion is strengthened by observing that not only is the total derived column density similar , but so is the distribution over velocity .",
    "lcll ( 0 ) & 5 & 4.5 & 3.8 + ( 385 ) & 7 & 5.8 & 4.8 + ( 668 ) & 8 & 5.5 & 4.9 + ( 863 ) & 6 & 3.0 & 2.9 + ( 977 ) & 5 & 1.4 & 1.3 + ( 7955 ) & 4 & 2.4 & 2.3 + ( 159856 ) & 5 & 5.0 & 4.3 + [ excited_level_chi2 ] @xmath35 - in @xmath20 + @xmath107 - number of lines used in the fit    as we have shown in   3.3 , the power law model yields the best fit to the  resonance line data .",
    "similar results are obtained for the five  lines that arise from the meta - stable level 2@xmath108s , as well as for the low - excitation levels of the  ground state .",
    "in addition to the five resonance lines lines ( i.e. , e=0 ) we studied so far uv multiplets 1,2 and 3 of  contain 31 lines from four low excitation levels ( with energies between 385 - 977 @xmath20 ; see table 1 of de  kool et  al .",
    "troughs from these lines will provide the diagnostics for finding the number density of the outflow and its ionization equilibrium ( korista et al .  2008 ) . in the contest of this paper ,",
    "these lines supply further constraints regarding , which of our two main models ( partial covering or power - law ) better represent the distribution of the absorbing material in front of the source .    in order to test which",
    "model works better , and to extract the crucial column densities of these energy levels , we again used @xmath18 minimization .",
    "since all these levels arise from the same ion , their distribution in front of the source should be similar to that of the resonance lines , the only freedom we allow is the ratio of level populations as this depends on the density and temperature of the absorber .",
    "therefore , our procedure is to use the same @xmath106 and @xmath109 we found for the partial covering or power - law , respectively , and vary @xmath110 and @xmath111 in order to find an optimal solution .",
    "this is a robust and powerful test since the absorption troughs for each level are a completely independent set of measurements from those of the resonance lines and from each other .",
    "in addition , we also observe five lines from the  metastable level at 159856 @xmath20 .",
    "although this material does not have to be distributed identically to the  distribution , this is still the simplest and most constraining assumption .",
    "therefore we use the exact same methodology on the  lines .",
    "the results are shown in table [ excited_level_chi2 ] .",
    "it is evident that for each of the five independent   levels and for the  lines , the @xmath83 of the power - law model is lower than that of the partial covering model .",
    "this supplies a strong support to the result already obtained for the resonance  trough : a two parameter power law model fit the data better than a two parameter partial covering model . as we discuss in   4 ,",
    "the power - law distribution is also a better physical model for the absorber in qso  23591241 . for these reasons",
    "we adopt the power - law results for all the troughs observed in the object .",
    "the few exceptions are blended lines for which we can only give lower limits .",
    "understanding the nature of quasar outflows and their influence on the nuclear and galactic environments , begins with deciphering of their geometry on both small and large scales .",
    "since all of the observational information is embedded within the absorption troughs , the first step is to determine the distribution of absorbing material that creates the troughs .",
    "advances in our understanding of this issue will shed light on the microphysics of the outflows , and more importantly will yield reliable measurements of the ionic column densities .",
    "these measurements in turn are crucial to determining almost every physical aspect of the outflows : the ionization equilibrium and abundances , gas density , distance , mass flux and kinetic luminosity .    until the late 1990s , all the work published on quasar outflows ( e.g. , korista et al .",
    "1992 ; turnshek et al .",
    "1996 ; hamann 1998 ) used the apparent optical depth ( @xmath5 ) model to extract column densities .",
    "this method works very well for ism and igm absorbers and corresponds to a simple gemetrical interpretation for the absorbing medium : a homogeneous screen in front of the light source .",
    "the well demonstrated failure of the @xmath5 model when applied to agn outflows troughs ( see sections 3 and 1 ) motivate us to look more carefully at the geometry involved . relatively secure is the following picture : for quasars , the size of the continuum source is @xmath112 cm and the size of the broad emission line region is @xmath113 cm ( kaspi et al .",
    "2005 ) . along our line of sight , there is material flowing towards us with radial velocities ranging from a few hundred to more than 30,000 .",
    "this material is , cosmologically speaking , in the vicinity of the quasar , within 0.1 - 10,000 pc .  from the central source :",
    "0.1 pc .  in balqso 1603 + 3002 ( arav et al 1999b ) ; 25 pc .",

    "2001 ) ; 28 kpc in quasar 3c 191 ( hamann et al .",
    "the question we try to address here is : what is the distribution of the absorbing material across the quasar emission region    most of the work that tried to advance beyond the @xmath5 model has used the pure covering factor method ( see   1 and   3 ) .",
    "this method has three advantages : 1 ) it lends itself to a simple geometrical picture where the absorbing material covers only part of the source .",
    "2 ) it yields perfect fits to doublet troughs , which comprise the vast majority of high - resolution data that is needed to advance beyond the @xmath5 model .",
    "however , as mentioned in   3.2 , the perfect fit arises mainly from fitting two equations with two unknowns .",
    "3 ) changes in the covering factor as a function of velocity were interpreted as accelerated motion with a small non - radial component ( the dynamical - geometrical model of arav et al .",
    "1999a ) .",
    "however , the pure covering factor model has some significant weaknesses as well .",
    "1 ) it has been known for a long time that troughs of different ions show different covering factors at the same velocity ( e.g. , balqso 1603 + 3002 , arav et al 1999b ) .",
    "explaining such behavior involves more complicated variants of the model , chief among them is abandoning the notion of homogeneous material distribution over the covered surface .",
    "we see a strong case of the above problem in qso  23591241 where the best fit covering factor solution for the excited levels of  is different ( smaller ) than the the covering factor for the e=0 level .",
    "2 ) while the issue above can be somewhat addressed using more complicated variants of the model , the following issue poses a more serious problem .",
    "we now have several cases where the distance of the outflow from the source was obtained by determining the number density of the outflow and combing it with the ionization equilibrium solution ( knowledge of the ionization parameter ) . some outflows , including the one studied here ,",
    "are found to be at distances of @xmath114 pc from the source , and at the same time show clear evidence that the @xmath5 model is inapplicable to their troughs ( e.g. , balqso 1044 + 3656 , de kool et al .  2001 ) . at distance up to @xmath010 times",
    "the size of the emission source , the dynamical - geometrical model for the changes in the covering factor as a function of velocity can work well .",
    "however , it is very difficult to envision a scenario where this model can work when the distance of the outflow from the emission source is @xmath115 times the size of the emission source .",
    "we note that the covering factor model does not suffer from these difficulties for outflows at much closer distances to the nucleus ( e.g. , balqso 1603 + 3002 and ngc  3783 , mentioned above ) .",
    "two main efforts were undertaken to address this serious flaw .",
    "one effort concentrated on finding a way to interpret the number density using a model that reduces the inferred distance by 2 - 3 orders of magnitude ( everett et al 2002 ) .",
    "this was done by invoking a shielded , multiphase gas that is made of a continuous low - density wind with embedded high - density clouds .",
    "the model also requires that the clouds are dusty and have strong differential dust depletion of iron compared to magnesium . while the everett et al ( 2002 ) model solves the covering factor problem by reducing the inferred distance substantially , this achievement comes at the heavy price of invoking several special conditions ( an ionization shield , multiphase gas , and dusty clouds with strong differential dust depletion ) .",
    "the second effort studied inhomogeneous distribution of absorbing material across the emission source as an alternative to the pure partial covering model .",
    "the strong feature of these models is that they do not require a finely tuned covering factor at large distances and at the same time do not invoke special physical conditions to do so .",
    "before we discuss the physical picture of these models we need to address the history of these models , which at first glance looks contradictory .",
    "de kool et al ( 2002 , dkka ) , showed that such models ( similar to the ones used here ) can yield adequate fits for two quasar outflows .",
    "in contrast , arav et al ( 2005 ) , found that the same models could not fit the outflow troughs of the seyfert galaxy mrk  279 .",
    "however , in the mrk  279 data analyzed by arav et al ( 2005 ) , more than half the flux at the spectral location of the outflow troughs is contributed by the broad emission line ( bel ) of the same transition .",
    "gabel et al ( 2005a ) determined that for mrk  279 the outflow covers the entire continuum source but only a portion of the bel .",
    "this picture looks physically plausible if the distance of the outflow is co - spatial or just outside the bel region .",
    "supporting evidence to this distance scale comes from the fact that the troughs in mrk  279 vary on timescale of @xmath84 year .",
    "arav et al ( 2005 ) tried to find a simple inhomogeneous power - law model that will fit the data without differentiating between the bel and continuum flux distributions , and concluded that this is not feasible .",
    "it is not known if more complicated inhomogeneous models that will differentiate between the bel and continuum flux sources could give a good fit to the mrk  279 data .",
    "in contrast , for qso  23591241 the contribution of the bels at the spectral location of the  troughs is less than 10% , and the distance scale is @xmath114 pc .",
    "( based on the inferred number density from troughs combined with a determination of the ionization parameter , arav et al 2008 ) .",
    "the combination of these conditions permits us to ignore the contribution of the separate bels and yields a better fit for the power - law model than the pure covering factor model does .",
    "finally , we need to address the fundamental question : what is the physical distribution of absorbing material in quasar outflows ? in this work we have showed that a power - law distribution of material is a better model both statistically and physically than the pure covering factor model .",
    "a power - law model is of course a highly simplified version of what the real distribution might be .",
    "a hint about the actual situation can be inferred from resolved images of other astrophysical outflows .",
    "planetary nebula , super nova remnants and other resolved outflows , tend to show a fragmented or web - like structure of the emitting material .",
    "we speculate that quasar outflows show similar structures on scales smaller than the size of the emission source .",
    "this is a straight forward way to explain the break down of the homogeneous absorption screen hypothesis .",
    "it is our hope that future dynamical models are able to yield physically - motivated predictions with regards to the distribution of outflowing absorbing material .",
    "these predictions could then be tested against the qso qso  23591241 and similar data sets .",
    "1 .   we presented 6.3 hours of vlt",
    "/ uves high - resolution ( r@xmath040,000 ) spectroscopic observations of qso  23591241 and identified all the absorption features associated with the outflow emanating from this object .",
    "the unprecedented high signal - to - noise data from five unblended troughs of  resonance lines yielded tight constraints on outflow trough formation models .",
    "we find that power - law distribution models for absorption material in front of the emission source gives a better fit to the  data than covering factor models .",
