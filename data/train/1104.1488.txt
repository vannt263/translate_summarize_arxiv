    "a more general quantum correlation , quantum discord , has also received a great deal of attention @xcite .",
    "the crucial quantum properties can be destroyed by the influence of the environment .",
    "many studies were done on this subject @xcite . and many interesting phenomena have been found , such as entanglement sudden death @xcite , entanglement revival @xcite , and sudden change for quantum discord @xcite . in order to avoid or delay the influence of the environment ,",
    "many methods have been proposed , such as quantum error correction @xcite , decoherence - free subspace @xcite , and dynamical control @xcite . among them , quantum feedback control @xcite is believed to be a promising method . for a system consisting of two two - level atoms coupled to a single - mode cavity which is heavily damped , the entanglement of the steady state can be improved by markovian feedback control@xcite .",
    "effects of different feedback hamiltonians and detection processes on entanglement generation were explored @xcite . in these works ,",
    "the detection is assumed to be perfect , but it is very hard to achieve in practice .",
    "the influence of the inefficiency of detection on the dynamical and asymptotic behavior remains an open question .    in the present work ,",
    "we investigate the dynamics of two identical atoms resonantly coupled to a single - mode cavity under feedback control .",
    "it was thought that the inefficiency decreases the steady entanglement , but our study shows that it may also increase the steady entanglement for some initial state . for the dynamical behavior",
    ", entanglement vanishes in finite time due to the inefficiency of detection .",
    "we also find that the noise of detection is an source to trigger the creation of entanglement and quantum discord .",
    "more importantly , we find that the dynamics of the entanglement may also undergo sudden change .",

    "when the cavity mode is heavily damped , it can be adiabatically eliminated . and in the limit @xmath5 , the dynamical evolution of this system is described by the dicke model @xcite : @xmath6 + d[a]\\rho , \\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the density matrix of the two atoms , @xmath8 represents the driving of the laser , and @xmath9\\rho   = a\\rho a^\\dag    - ( a^\\dag   a\\rho   + \\rho a^\\dag   a)/2 $ ] represents the irreversible evolution induced by the interaction between the system and the environment with the jump operator @xmath10 . without losing generality ,",
    "we let @xmath11 .    in this paper",
    ", we will consider the markovian feedback @xcite , with the control hamiltonian @xmath12 , where @xmath0 is the signal from the homodyne detection of the cavity output .    in the homodyne - based scheme , the detector registers a continuous photocurrent , and the feedback hamiltonian is constantly applied to the system .",

    "2 ( a ) ) .",
    "after it decreases to zero , it increases again to steady value .",
    "more importantly , entanglement vanishes in finite time when the detection is inefficiency , @xmath39 .",
    "the duration of the vanishing time increases as @xmath17 decreases . for the steady concurrence",
    ", we can get a closed expression as @xmath40 .",
    "it is an increasing function of @xmath17 .",
    "when the efficiency of the detection is perfect , the steady concurrence is @xmath18 .        since the density matrix eq .",
    "( [ rho ] ) is specified by three parameters ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 ) , we can explain the finite - time vanishing of entanglement induced by the inefficiency of the detection by the pictorial approach , similar to @xcite . in fig .",
    "3 , separable states with the form of eq . ( [ rho ] )",
    "are in the region of the wedge shape .",
    "initial state is located on the point @xmath44 .",
    "the final state is located on the @xmath41 axis . since the region of the valid states ( @xmath45 $ ] , @xmath46 and @xmath47 )",
    "is separated by the region of separable states , only when the evolution of the state just crosses the boundary of wedge shape the entanglement does nt vanish in finite time .",
    "we can prove that it only happens when @xmath48 .",
    "for geometric measure of quantum discord , it follows the same tendency as concurrence , but without sudden death .",
    "it agrees with the general result that almost all states with none zero discord can never lead to states with zero discord for a finite time interval for markovian dynamics @xcite . from fig . 2 ( a ) we can see that the geometric measure of quantum discord undergoes discontinuous change . for the case",
    "there is no feedback , the dynamics of the discord is different from concurrence .",
    "the concurrence remains zero all the time , while the discord increases first and then goes to zero . from fig .",
    "3 , we can see that the evolution is confined in the region of separable states , but it does nt remain on the straight line @xmath49 , where discord equals zero , so the discord is not zero .    , for the case of ( i ) without feedback ( black dash curve ) , ( ii ) with perfect detection ( black solid curve ) ( iii)with imperfect detection @xmath50 ( gray solid curve ) . all the separable states are in the region of wedge shape.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    for the initial state @xmath25 , the solution is given by : @xmath51    the concurrence and discord increases to the steady value monotonely ( see fig . 2 ( b ) ) .",
    "the dynamics is very simple .",
    "but the question is where the concurrence and discord come from . from the initial condition",
    ", we can get that the concurrence and discord are not from the initial state of the atoms , the environment , or the driving field .",
    "the only source of the concurrence and discord is the control field .",
    "but since the the atom are initially in the lower state , there is no photon emitted from the atoms .",
    "so the detector can not be trigged by the photon from the atoms .",
    "but this photon is not the unique source to trigger the detector .",
    "the noise can also trigger the detector , too .",
    "so we can say that the concurrence and discord is triggered by the noise .    for the initial state @xmath52 ,",
    "the form of the density matrix is not of the form of eq .",
    "( [ rho ] ) .",
    "we solve the master equation by fourth - order runge - kutta method .",
    "the concurrence and discord increase to steady values monotonely ( see fig .",
    "2 ( c ) ) . but the steady - state concurrence is inverse proportional to the detection efficiency .",
    "that means the feedback is not always good for getting a high concurrence and discord .",
    "more seriously , if the detection is perfect , the concurrence and discord remains zero all the time .",
    "_ entangled initial states_.dynamics for entangled initial states are also be for initial state @xmath22 , the concurrence and discord decrease to steady values ( see fig .",
    "4 ( a ) ) . and",
    "the steady - state concurrence is proportional to the detection efficiency . for the perfect detection ,",
    "the concurrence remains @xmath18 and the discord remains @xmath53 all the time .",
    "in fact , detail analysis tells us that the state remains @xmath54 .",
    "although @xmath54 is not a decoherence - free state under the influence of the environment , it is a steady state for the dynamics under the perfect feedback control @xcite .",
    "we also study the case when the initial state is @xmath55 .",
    "different from the case of @xmath54 , the concurrence remains @xmath18 and discord remains @xmath53 no matter what @xmath17 is ( see fig .",
    "4 ( b ) ) . that means the inefficiency of the detection does nt influence the dynamics.this is because , firstly , the initial state is in the decoherence free subspace , so the state of the system does nt change under the influence of the environment , secondly , the @xmath56 is invariant under the control hamiltonian , that means even if the feedback control is triggered by the noise , the control laser does not change the state of the system .",
    "so , we can say , the control hamiltonian is compatible with decoherence free subspace .",
    "for the initial state @xmath57 , the concurrence and discord decrease at first , and then increase to steady values ( see fig .",
    "4 ( c ) ) . and",
    "when the detection is imperfect , the concurrence vanishes in finite time .",
    "for the initial state @xmath58 , the concurrence and discord decrease very quickly , and then increase to steady values . and when the detection is not perfect , the concurrence vanishes in finite time ( see fig .",
    "4 ( d ) ) .",
    "more importantly , for perfect detection , sudden change may also happen to concurrence , at @xmath59 .",
    "when @xmath48 , there is a close expression of concurrence , @xmath60 $ ] , with @xmath61 $ ] and @xmath62 $ ] .",
    "sudden change happens at @xmath59 .",
    "but it is not the time that the size relation of @xmath63 and @xmath64 changes . instead , at @xmath59",
    ", @xmath63 is not continuous .",
    "this kind of sudden change is different from the sudden change of discord .",
    "although entanglement sudden death and revival can also be regarded as a kind of sudden change happened when concurrence equals zero , in our case , the sudden change happens at a nonzero value .",
    "since this kind of sudden change is very rare , this remains an open whether there is some physical meaning behind it or it is just from the definition of concurrence .",
    "to summarize , we study a model of two collectively damped atoms under practical feedback control .",
    "we focus on the effect of the detection inefficiency on the dynamical and asymptotic behavior of the entanglement and quantum discord .",
    "we find that the inefficiency of detection induces the entanglement to vanish in finite time , and can counterintuitively increase the asymptotic entanglement and quantum discord .",
    "the noise of detection can trigger control field to create entanglement and quantum discord when no photon are emitted from the atoms .",
    "more importantly , we find that the dynamics of entanglement also presents sudden change .",
