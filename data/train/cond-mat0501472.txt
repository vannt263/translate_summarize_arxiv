    "carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) are cylindrical molecules with nanometer diameter and micrometer length .",
    "since the discovery of cnts just over a decade ago,@xcite their unique electronic and structural properties have aroused great excitement in the scientific community and promise a broad range of applications .",
    "significant theoretical effort has been applied to develop refined models of the electronic structure of carbon nanotubes , as well as their optical and transport properties , although even a simple tight - binding model@xcite yielding analytic solutions is sufficient to elucidate key nanotube features ( e.g. whether a cnt of given structure will exhibit metallic or semiconducting properties ) . in this paper",
    "we apply such a model to a particular type of single - wall cnt , a so - called @xmath0 nanotube . in sec .",
    "[ nofield ] we show that for such a cnt the electron motion corresponds to a de broglie wave propagating along a helical line .",
    "the theoretical treatment of this type of cnt in an electric field perpendicular to the nanotube axis ( transverse electric field ) can be reduced to a one - dimensional superlattice problem ( see sec .",
    "[ field ] ) .",
    "such superlattice behavior of current - carrying electrons suggests the application of cnts to the development of novel carbon nanotube - based devices .",
    "a single - wall carbon nanotube may be considered as a single graphite sheet rolled into a cylinder .",
    "the electronic energy spectrum of the cnt is therefore intimately related to the energy spectrum @xmath1 of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) graphite sheet , which can be written in the tight - binding approximation as@xcite : @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the electron wave vector components in the graphite sheet plane along the @xmath5 and @xmath6 axes , respectively ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we can construct , for example , a @xmath7 carbon nanotube .",
    "the dashed lines will then form a helical line on the nanotube wall.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    in the energy spectrum , the plus and minus signs correspond to the conduction and valence bands , respectively , @xmath8 ev is the transfer integral between @xmath9-orbitals of neighboring carbon atoms , and the lattice constant @xmath10  , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the 2d basis vectors and @xmath13  is the interatomic distance in graphite .",
    "the way in which the 2d graphite sheet is rolled up to form the cnt can be described by two vectors , the translation vector @xmath14 and the chiral vector @xmath15 ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the chiral vector @xmath15 can be expressed in terms of the 2d basis vectors of the unrolled graphite sheet as @xmath16 , where the pair of integers @xmath17 is used as a standard notation@xcite for a cnt of given crystal structure . to obtain the electronic energy spectrum of the @xmath17 cnt , we begin by expressing the wave vector @xmath18 in terms of components along @xmath14 and @xmath15 as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are subject to the following constraints : @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xmath24 .",
    "the integer @xmath25 represents the electron angular momentum along the nanotube axis and @xmath26 is the number of elementary atomic cells consisting of two carbon atoms ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) per area @xmath29 .",
    "the number @xmath30 appearing in eq .",
    "is the greatest common divisor of the two integers ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) .",
    "the lengths of the chiral vector and translation vector are given by @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "the energy spectrum of a @xmath17 cnt can be obtained by expressing @xmath3 and @xmath4 in terms of @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and substituting them in eq .  , thus yielding @xmath35 + 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{k_sa}{2}\\right)\\right|,\\ ] ] where we have introduced the new parameter @xmath36 , and the chiral angle @xmath37 @xmath38 shown in fig .",

    "we obtain @xmath42 + 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{k_sa}{2}\\right)\\right|,\\ ] ] which , together with the constraint @xmath23 , yields an electron energy spectrum of the form @xmath43^{1/2}.\\ ] ] for @xmath44 , eq .",
    "becomes independent of @xmath25 , and we obtain the electron energy spectrum of a @xmath0 cnt in the form @xmath45^{1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath46 correspond to the valence and conduction bands , respectively .",
    "it should be noted that the spectrum depends on the parameter @xmath47 alone , in contrast to the general case of a @xmath17 cnt , for which the electron energy spectrum depends on two parameters ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 are conventionally used ) .",
    "this peculiarity of a @xmath0 cnt is a consequence of its special crystal symmetry : the @xmath0 cnt lattice can be obtained by translation of an elementary two - atom cell along a helical line on the nanotube wall ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) . as a result",
    ", the parameter @xmath47 has the meaning of an electron wave vector along the helical line , and so any possible electron motion in a @xmath0 cnt can be described by a de broglie wave propagating along such a line .",
    "thus , @xmath0 cnts represent a previously overlooked distinctive class of nanotubes , which may be termed ` helical ' nanotubes .",
    "the electron energy spectrum of a ( 4,1 ) cnt as a function of the helical wave number @xmath47 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4_1nofield ] .",
    "the band gap for this natotube closes at @xmath48 , and it can be shown that the same is true for all metallic @xmath0 nanotubes .",
    "cnt as a function of the wave number @xmath47 along a helical line on a nanotube wall.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]",
    "both descriptions of the energy spectrum of a @xmath0 cnt  by two parameters , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , or a single parameter @xmath47  are physically equivalent .",
    "however , the second description is more convenient for studies of electron processes determined by the above - mentioned helical symmetry of electron motion , and allows one to discover new physical effects ( e.g. the electron - electron interaction should be strongly modified for helical one - dimensional motion@xcite ) .",
    "we shall now show that such helical symmetry results in superlattice behavior of a @xmath0 cnt in the presence of an electric field oriented perpendicular to the nanotube axis ( a transverse electric field ) .",
    "the potential energy of an electron on a helix subject to a transverse electric field takes the form @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the electron charge , @xmath51 is the electric field strength , @xmath52 is the radius of the cnt , @xmath53 is the electron coordinate along the above - mentioned helical line , @xmath54 is the length of a single coil of the helix , and the electric potential is assumed to be zero at the axis of the cnt .",
    "the potential energy is periodic in the electron coordinate @xmath53 along the helical line and the period of the potential is equal to @xmath55 . since this period is proportional to the cnt radius @xmath56 and is greater than the interatomic distance @xmath57 , the cnt assumes typical superlattice properties .",
    "in particular , bragg reflection of electron waves with wave vectors @xmath58 results in energy splitting within the conduction and valence bands of the cnt .",
    "we shall now study this effect in more detail .    in the framework of the tight - binding model,@xcite considering only three nearest neighbors to each atom , the wave functions for electron states with corresponding energies",
    "can be written as @xmath59\\exp(ik_sta),\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the total number of two - atom cells in the cnt , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are @xmath9-orbital wave functions for the two carbon atoms @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively , @xmath63 is the number along the helical line for an elementary cell consisting of these two atoms ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) , and @xmath64 .",
    "the value of the potential energy @xmath65 in the external electric field at the position of a particular atom of the cnt depends on the angle between the electric field vector and the vector normal to the nanotube axis which passes through this atom . as a consequence ,",
    "the coordinate of atom @xmath27 in cell number @xmath63 along the helical line is @xmath66 the angle @xmath67 is defined in such a way that @xmath68 $ ] is the coordinate in the direction of the electric field ( with zero at the cnt axis ) of atom @xmath28 in the cell with @xmath69 . using eqs .   and , we can write the matrix element of the potential energy as @xmath70 where @xmath71 \\exp(\\pm i\\phi),\\ ] ] and @xmath72 is the kronecker delta . in the derivation of eqs .",
    "and we have also assumed that the external electric field @xmath51 is much less than the atomic field , i.e. @xmath73 this allows us to neglect any change in the atomic wave functions @xmath61 and @xmath62 due to the field @xmath51 , and we take into account only the mixing of states by the field . according to eq .",
    ", the field mixes only electron states with wave vectors differing by @xmath74 . in this approximation ,",
    "the exact wave function in the presence of the electric field , @xmath75 , can be expressed as a superposition of wave functions with @xmath47 shifted by integer numbers of @xmath74 : @xmath76 to ensure that in eq .",
    "we sum only over _ different _ electron states , the parameter @xmath77 should be the smallest integer defined by the condition @xmath78 .",
    "this condition , together with the @xmath79 periodicity of @xmath80 , implies that @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the smallest integer for which this equality is satisfied . using eq .   together with eq .",
    "one can obtain @xmath83 , which yields @xmath84 .",
    "this result has a transparent physical interpretation , since the two closest carbon atoms equivalent with respect to a translation parallel to the nanotube axis are separated by a distance @xmath85 along a helical line .    substituting the wave function into the schrdinger equation with the potential energy we obtain a system of equations for the coefficients @xmath86 entering eq .  : @xmath87b_{j\\nu } + \\sum_{i=1}^2\\sum_{\\nu^\\prime=0}^{n-1}\\langle\\psi_j\\left(k_s + 2\\pi\\nu /l_0\\right ) |u|\\psi_i\\left(k_s+2\\pi\\nu^\\prime",
    "/ l_0\\right)\\rangle b_{i\\nu^\\prime}=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath88 , the index @xmath89 takes the value @xmath90 or @xmath91 for the valence and conduction bands , respectively , and @xmath92 is the electron energy in the presence of the transverse electric field .",
    "let us consider the states @xmath93 and @xmath94 in the same cnt energy band , which are at the boundaries of a brillouin zone created by the periodic ` superlattice ' potential of the external field .",
    "one should expect the appearence of energy gaps at these values of @xmath47 due to bragg reflection of electron waves from the superlattice potential .",
    "these states are separated by @xmath74 and have the same energy , which means that they are strongly mixed by the electric field . for these values of @xmath47",
    "it can be shown that the contributions to the sum in eq .   from all other states",
    "can be neglected for sufficiently weak fields , @xmath95 . as a result",
    ", the system of equations is reduced to just two equations , from which the energy of bragg band splitting @xmath96 is found to be @xmath97 thus , even a small electric field results in a superlattice - like change of the electron energy spectrum in @xmath0 cnts , with the appearance of bragg energy gaps proportional to the field amplitude @xmath51 and the nanotube radius @xmath56 .",
    "notably , this dependence of the bragg gaps on the external field and radius applies to any helical quasi - one - dimensional nanostructure in a transverse electric field : this generic feature arises from the symmetry of the nanostructure , and is independent of the parameters of the tight - binding model used to derive eq .  .",
    "for example , it should be possible to observe a similar effect in recently fabricated ingaas / gaas and si / sige semiconductor nanohelices.@xcite    it should be emphasized that for single - wall carbon nanotubes the discussed superlattice behavior is a unique feature of @xmath0 structures only . for the general case of a @xmath17 cnt with @xmath98 , the energy spectrum depends on the quantum number @xmath25 in addition to @xmath47 . as already mentioned , @xmath25 represents the projection of the electron angular momentum on the nanotube axis , and it follows from the corresponding selection rule that the transverse electric field only mixes electron states with angular momentum @xmath25 and @xmath99 . for @xmath100 , however , states with @xmath25 differing by one correspond to different subbands , and in general have different energies for @xmath101 , so that there is no bragg scattering between these states",
    ". the only effect of the electric field , therefore , is to mix electron states with different energies , which does not lead to noticeable modification of the dispersion curves for weak electric fields.@xcite    for the particular case of a @xmath102 cnt the energy spectrum can be obtained in analytic form for any electron state , since the system of equations consists of four equations only .",
    "this system results in a biquadratic equation for the eigenvalues @xmath92 : @xmath103 where @xmath104 $ ] , @xmath105 $ ] , @xmath106 ^ 2 $ ] , @xmath107 ^ 2 $ ] , and @xmath108 .",
    "the energy spectrum @xmath92 obtained from eq .",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( solid lines ) for a range of wave vectors @xmath109 .",
    "cnt in the presence of a transverse electric field @xmath110 with @xmath111 ( solid lines ) and without the electric field ( dashed lines ) .",
    "the inner pair of vertical dotted lines indicates the first brillouin zone boundary in the presence of the field , whereas the outer pair corresponds to the first brillouin zone boundary without the field .",
    "@xmath96 is the bragg gap opened by the electric field.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    in the figure , positive energies correspond to the conduction band and negative energies to the valence band .",
    "the energy spectrum in the absence of the field is shown for comparison ( dashed lines ) . according to eq .",
    ", the superlattice period @xmath55 for a @xmath102 cnt is equal to twice the lattice constant @xmath112 .",
    "therefore , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the width of the first brillouin zone in the presence of a transverse electric field is half that without the field .",
    "it can also be seen that the electric field opens gaps in the dispersion curve at @xmath113 due to the aforementioned bragg reflection of electron waves . for electric fields satisfying condition , we obtain from eq .   the bragg gap @xmath114 the result in eq .",
    "can also be obtained from the more general formula .",
    "it should be noted that the bragg gap , as well as the whole energy spectrum of the cnt in a transverse electric field , depends on the orientation of the cnt relative to the field ( i.e. on the angle of rotation @xmath67 ) . in particular , when @xmath115 the bragg gap is zero : for this angle the values of the electric field potential at atoms @xmath27 and @xmath28 in a @xmath102 cnt are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign , and so the mean value of the potential within one elementary cell of the cnt is zero .    in the general case of a @xmath0 nanotube , for external electric field intensities attainable in experiment ( @xmath116 v / cm ) and for a typical nanotube of radius @xmath117  ,",
    "the value of the bragg gap given by is @xmath118 ev , which is comparable to the characteristic energy of band splitting in conventional semiconductor superlattices . as a consequence",
    ", the discussed superlattice effects generated by the transverse electric field in @xmath0 cnts should be observable in experiments , and may take place in existing cnt field - effect devices.@xcite the inherent regularity of a nanotube - based superlattice , with the superlattice period determined by the cnt radius , presents a distinct advantage over semiconductor superlattices , in which monolayer fluctuations are unavoidable .",
    "a whole range of new nanoelectronic devices based on the discussed superlattice properties of @xmath0 cnts can be envisaged , including bloch oscillators@xcite and quantum cascade lasers.@xcite an evaluation of the feasibility of these novel devices and selection of their optimal parameters will undoubtedly form the subject of extensive future research .",
    "in this paper we have discussed a previously overlooked class of cnts , which may be termed ` helical ' nanotubes .",
    "while we have concentrated on the superlattice behavior of such nanotubes in a transverse electric field , we also expect their unique symmetry to manifest itself in modification of the electron - electron , electron - phonon and electron - photon interactions .",
    "in addition , we have shown that superlattice behavior in a transverse electric field is a generic feature of helical quasi - one - dimensional nanostructures , which raises new possibilities for developing optoelectronic devices operating in the terahertz range of frequencies .",
