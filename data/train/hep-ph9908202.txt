    "the presently observed decay processes can be catalogued into two classes . the first class , e.g. @xmath14 , is dominated by tree ( t ) level @xmath15 transitions , but may have sizable penguin ( p ) contributions . the second class , e.g. @xmath16 and the newly observed @xmath17 mode , are penguin dominant processes which may have sizable t / p .",
