    "theory predicts since long that the properties of hadrons change if they are surrounded by matter . for baryons",
    "this change has been verified in @xmath4a reactions where the total photon absorption cross section @xcite shows a nontrivial dependence on the mass of the target nucleus .",
    "this nontrivial dependence has been interpreted as a change of the properties of the nuclear resonances in matter @xcite .",
    "it is , however , difficult to asses whether the observed in - medium modifications have to be attributed to a change of the resonance properties or to a change of those of their decay products . coupled channel calculations provide a mean to answer this question but presently neither the data are sufficiently precise nor the theoretical ingredients can be sufficiently well determined in order to allow for firm conclusions even if for some hadrons like the @xmath5 @xcite and k @xcite mesons a lot of progress has been made recently .",
    "the strategy is different for both cases .",
    "the study of the strange mesons takes advantage of the fact that they have to be produced in a heavy ion reaction , that each strange hadron is accompanied by an anti - strange one and that the production cross sections are phase space dominated .",
    "systematic studies of the excitation function and of the system size dependence of the yields as well as of the modification of the measured k meson spectra as compared to that measured in pp collisions allow for conclusions on the interaction of the k s with the environment @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5 meson can decay into a dilepton pair which - being an electromagnetic probe - does not interact anymore with the nuclear environment . therefore this dilepton pair carries direct information on the particle at the time point of its decay in the medium .",
    "the problem is that many resonances and mesons contribute to the dilepton yield and it is all but easy to determine which particle is at the origin of the dilepton pair . in order to compare data with theory",
    ", one has to identify all dilepton sources and their contribution to the dilepton spectra .",
    "this superposition of the different sources is called cocktail plot .",
    "if it deviates from experiment at least one of the sources is not correctly described and one may start to test how this source is modified by the hadronic environment .",
    "it was the dls collaboration which first presented dilepton invariant mass spectra in heavy ion collisions at beam energies of around 1 agev @xcite . the systematic errors of these exploratory experiments have been , however , too large to allow for a detailed conclusion on the behavior of hadrons in matter .",
    "later , at higher ( sps ) energies , the ceres / na45 collaboration @xcite presented spectra , which were not in agreement with the standard cocktail plots .",
    "two theoretical models have been advanced to explain this difference .",
    "rapp et al .",
    "@xcite calculated the in medium modification of the spectral function of the @xmath5 in hadronic matter . with this in - medium change of the spectral function the theoretical and experimental yields agree .",
    "as eletsky et al .",
    "@xcite explained @xmath5 - meson and @xmath5 - baryon interactions compensate each other as far as the shift of the pole mass is concerned but collisions broaden the width considerably .",
    "gallmeister et al .",
    "@xcite showed on the other side that the discrepancy disappears as well if one adds to the spectrum the emission of the dileptons from a thermal @xmath6 ( or hadron - hadron ) annihilation using lowest order qcd calculations .    most recently the na60 collaboration measured very precisely the invariant mass spectrum of dileptons in the @xmath5 mass region @xcite but it is still debated whether the discrepancy between cocktail plot and data is due to a modification of hadronic properties or due to annihilation processes .",
    "additional information may be obtained from the @xmath7 spectra @xcite because each emission source shows a specific transverse momentum pattern .",
    "however , consensus about the relative importance of the different possible production mechanism has not been obtained yet .    to clarify this question it is necessary to study the dilepton production at lower energies where quarks remain bound in hadrons and hadron hadron annihilations are rare",
    ". then the process proposed by gallmeister is absent and thermal production does not play a decisive role .",
    "in addition one has to investigate small systems where direct collisions dominate over the production in the participant heat bath .",
    "recently the hades collaboration has published the dilepton invariant mass spectrum for the reaction c + c at 2 agev @xcite .",
    "this system is small and at this energy the formation of a quark phase is beyond reach as the analysis of many other observables has shown .",
    "it may therefore serve to solve the question of how the @xmath5 meson changes in a hadronic environment provided that it can be proven that all the other ingredients of the cocktail plot are well under control .",
    "it is the purpose of this article to investigate in detail the dilepton invariant mass spectra using one of the presently available programs which simulate heavy ion reactions on an event by event basis , the isospin quantum molecular dynamics ( iqmd ) approach .",
    "the main objective is to find out whether the present dilepton data are sufficiently precise to allow for conclusions on the theoretically predicted change of the particle properties in a nuclear environment or to identify the obstacles on the way to achieve this goal .",
    "we concentrate in this exploratory study on the most significant modifications : mass shifts and changes of the decay width .    before we present the results of our simulations",
    "we start out with a short presentation of the model and a discussion of our present theoretical and experimental knowledge on all the elementary processes which contribute to the dilepton spectra and of how they are implemented in our simulation program .",
    "the semi - classical iqmd program @xcite simulates heavy ion reactions on a event by event basis and is one of the standard analyzing tools for heavy ion reactions at and below 2 agev . in this",
    "program hadrons interact by potentials and by collisions .",
    "the former ones are brckner g - matrix parameterizations for the baryons or parametrized meson - baryon potentials .",
    "thus nuclei are bound objects with a binding energy following the weizscker mass formula .",
    "if two hadrons come closer than @xmath8 they collide . if several exit channels are available a random number determines which one is realized .",
    "the relative weight is given by the relative cross section .",
    "the momenta and the mass ( if the particles have a finite width ) of the hadrons in the final state are randomly determined .",
    "their distribution follows either experimental measurements or phase space , if experimental results are not available . in the standard version @xcite of the program ,",
    "nucleons as well as baryonic resonances , pions and kaons are the particles which are propagated .    for the investigation presented here we have added production cross sections of all particles which may contribute to the invariant mass spectrum of dileptons : np bremsstrahlung , @xmath3 dalitz and direct decay , @xmath9 ( dalitz and direct ) and @xmath5 decay , @xmath10 dalitz decay and @xmath11 dalitz decay .",
    "because we concentrate on a very light system , where the probability that mesons have secondary interactions is small , it has not been necessary to add the ( largely unknown ) meson absorption or rescattering cross sections or to use off - shell transport approaches .",
    "when these particles are produced we use the branching ratios of the particle data group @xcite to determine their contribution to the dilepton spectrum .",
    "at low invariant mass the overwhelming number of dileptons comes from the decay of @xmath11 mesons which can decay into dileptons via @xmath12 .",
    "the shape of the mass distribution of a dilepton in a @xmath11 dalitz decay is given by @xcite :    @xmath13    @xmath14 is the mass of the @xmath15 , @xmath16 the electron mass and m that of the dilepton pair .",

    "whereas the cross section @xmath20 is known over the whole excess energy interval which is relevant for our investigation the @xmath21 cross section is known only up to an excess energy of @xmath22 gev .",
    "thus we have to extrapolate this cross section into the relevant excess energy domain .",
    "this extrapolation leaves a lot of freedom even if the @xmath3 meson production cross section has been measured in heavy ion reactions by the taps collaboration .",

    "it is interesting to see in detail the differences between elementary collisions at @xmath165 gev and heavy ion collisions at the same nominal energy which show the large @xmath71 distribution of the nn collisions displayed in fig .",
    "[ csdiffpp2gev ] .",
    "there we see two peaks .",
    "the high energy peak is due to collisions between projectile and target nucleons , whereas the low energy peak is due to collisions among either projectile or target nucleons .",
    "the latter collisions contribute only to the bremsstrahlung and to the @xmath11 part of the dilepton spectrum . due to rescattering the maximum of the distribution of the primary collisions is shifted toward a lower @xmath71 value .",
    "the consequences of the broad @xmath71 distribution on the @xmath3 and @xmath9 production as compared to elementary collisions at the nominal energy are summarized in table [ multiplicite2gev ] .",
    "the first line shows the average @xmath71 value of all collisions above threshold . for the @xmath3",
    "this value is slightly below , for the @xmath9 - due to the larger threshold - slightly above the value for elementary collisions .",
    "also the average number of collisions in c+c reactions depends on the particle type as seen in the second line . for the @xmath3 production",
    "we find 4.65 collisions above threshold for the @xmath9 production 2.32 .",
    "for the standard scenario ( @xmath166 , br(@xmath167 and @xmath168 ) , we display in the third and the fourth line the average production cross section in np and pp collisions in the heavy ion reaction as compared to the elementary reaction .",
    "for the @xmath3 the average @xmath151 and @xmath169 are lower in cc collisions than in elementary ones .",
    "this decrease has two origins : firstly the lower @xmath170 and secondly the form of the @xmath3 production cross section which has a maximum at around @xmath71=2.697 gev and stays almost constant at higher energies . for the @xmath9 meson",
    "the situation is completely different .",
    "the elementary cross section increases with energy for all relevant energies and the average @xmath71 value in c+c is larger than that in elementary collisions . therefore np as well as pp collisions in the heavy ion reaction produce more @xmath9 mesons than elementary collisions at the same nominal energy .",
    "consequently the enhancement factor of @xmath3 and @xmath9 mesons in heavy ion collisions is very different .",
    "for the 1 agev reaction ( table [ multiplicite1gev ] ) the situation is very different .",
    "the @xmath71 distribution of the collision in c+c is displayed in fig . [ csdiffpp1gev ] . in elementary nn collisions at the same energy neither @xmath9 nor @xmath3 mesons can be produced ( @xmath171 = 2.659 gev and @xmath172 = 2.424 gev ) .",
    "however , with the fermi momentum , in c+c collisions subthreshold @xmath9 and @xmath3 production is possible . due to the larger threshold @xmath9 production is suppressed with respect to the @xmath3 production .",
    "the production cross section at this energy tests the fermi motion in the simulations which is not easy to model in semi - classical simulation codes .",
    "therefore systematic errors reduce the predictive power for the meson production at this energy , but the analysis of the subthreshold kaon production shows that in between a factor of two the results are certainly trustworthy .",
    "in summary we have shown that the dilepton spectrum measured by the hades collaboration in the reaction 2 agev c+c at invariant masses above 600 mev is not compatible with the standard scenario of simulation programs which uses free cross sections and free meson masses .",
    "introducing a medium modification of the @xmath9 mass and lowering the unknown @xmath173 cross section brings the calculation in agreement with data .",
    "the extrapolation from elementary cross section at the same nominal energy to heavy ion reactions is all but trivial .",
    "it depends on the threshold and on the energy dependence of the cross section . before the elementary production cross sections in pn reactions are not determined and before the cross sections for baryonic resonances are not better known heavy ion data do not provide the desired information on possible in medium modification of the meson properties .",
    ".comparison of the average number of collisions above threshold , of the average production cross section per nn collision in cc collisions , the cross section in elementary pp and pn reactions and the multiplicity in pp , pn and cc collisions at a beam energy of 2 agev for @xmath3 and @xmath9 mesons .
