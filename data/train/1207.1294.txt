    "the first theoretical proposal for a two - dimensional topological insulator was based on graphene with intrinsic spin - orbit interaction ( soi )  @xcite .",
    "although the spin - orbit coupling of graphene is too small to render an experimental evidence  @xcite , this initiated several other suggestions for two - dimensional materials and heterostructures showing topological insulator features  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the criteria for topological insulators were extended to three dimensions  @xcite and were experimentally verified in other suitable materials like bise  @xcite or bi@xmath0te@xmath1  @xcite . in the meantime , the quantum spin hall effect , a prominent transport feature of two - dimensional topological insulators , has been observed in hgte / cdte quantum wells  @xcite as well as for inas / gasb heterostructures  @xcite . in both experiments",
    "the transmission through a mesoscopic hall bar is quantized since the bulk of the system is insulating and the current is only carried by edge states , which are protected from backscattering due to time - reversal symmetry .    whilst many theoretical investigations are focused on these edge states of two - dimensional topological insulators  @xcite , signatures of the special band topology are also traceable in other observables even away from the bulk band gap . to this end",
    "we consider a well studied phenomenon in phase coherent transport through disordered quantum systems , namely weak localization ( wl )  @xcite for systems without soi and weak antilocalization ( wal )  @xcite in presence of soi .",
    "the effect stems from the self interference of the charge carriers leading to a quantum correction to the classical transmission for time reversal symmetric systems .",
    "breaking of this symmetry can be easily achieved by applying a perpendicular magnetic field . in a semiclassical picture ,",
    "the effect is understood in terms of interference between waves traveling in opposite directions along backscattered paths and averaging over all such trajectory pairs .",
    "besides the relative phase shift arising from the enclosed flux of an external perpendicular magnetic field , intrinsic berry phases affect the interference and thereby the wl behavior . as a consequence ,",
    "the signatures of wl in transport through systems with strong berry phases , as for example hgte heterostructures , can differ significantly from those of conventional electron gases .    to our knowledge , there are only a few theoretical studies of wl in systems with inverted band ordering  @xcite .",
    "diagrammatic studies for the two - dimensional case show a transition between wl and wal upon varying the chemical potential  @xcite , similar to the wl physics in topological insulator thin films  @xcite , which is supported by experimental investigations  @xcite .",
    "however , major soi effects from bulk and inversion asymmetry are not included , which alter the wl signal , as we will show in this work . a recent experiment with hgte heterostructures revealed wal in diffusive transport  @xcite and detailed investigations attested an energy dependence of the wal peak  @xcite . since no theories for wl in heterostructures with inverted band ordering including soi are at hand , only conventional theories for a@xmath1b@xmath2 semiconductors  @xcite have yet been applied to analyze these results .    in order to explore how wl",
    "effects are altered by the inverted band ordering of topological insulators , we perform numerical transport calculations .",
    "we confirm the transition between wl and wal reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , if soi can be neglected .",
    "we explain the effect in terms of the berry phase of the bands involved .",
    "moreover , we additionally find a splitting of the wl magnetoconductance profiles due to the two spin species that can also be traced back to the berry phase and is not accounted for in previous diagrammatic studies .",
    "additionally , we show how the wl phenomenon is altered by soi , and how bulk and structure inversion asymmetry lead to significantly different wal features that can strongly depend on the band ordering .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in section  [ sec : model ] we introduce the model used to describe multi - band quantum transport in diffusive hgte heterostructures . in section  [ sec : noso ] we focus on effects of the berry phase and the energy dependence of wl and wal without soi . in section  [ sec : withso ] we include soi and show why a variation in wal upon change in energy serves as an indicator for inverted band ordering . finally , in section  [ sec : conclude ]",

    "in the following , we assume a negligibly small bia and sia spin - orbit interaction leading to a hamiltonian ( [ hhgte ] ) with two uncoupled blocks . we will show that the berry phase of each of those blocks leads to an energy dependence of the wl signal different for the two band orderings . without losing generality",
