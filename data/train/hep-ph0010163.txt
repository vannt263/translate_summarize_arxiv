    "the experiments at this new facility will have a high potential to discover new physics and to make various precision measurements , see , for example @xcite .",
    "both the general purpose @xmath0 experiments , atlas @xcite and cms @xcite , will provide high statistics data samples , and the accuracy of the precision measurements will be limited by systematic effects and , in many cases , by the uncertainty in the measurement of the luminosity @xmath8 .",
    "for example , precision measurements in the higgs sector of typical accuracy of about 7% , for a wide range of possible higgs mass , require the uncertainty in the luminosity to be @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "both lhc experiments are aiming at measuring the luminosity to 5% .",
    "recall also that the enhancement in luminosity that will be achieved in run ii of the fermilab tevatron @xmath1 - collider will herald a new era of precision studies @xcite .",
    "an obvious requirement for the success of these precision measurements is that the uncertainties in the theoretical calculations of the cross sections for the basic processes , which are to be used to determine the luminosity , should match the desired experimental accuracies .    in general , there are two possibilities to determine the luminosity  either ( i ) to measure a pair of cross sections which are connected quadratically with each other , or ( ii ) to measure a cross section whose value is well known or which may be calculated with good accuracy .",
    "the well - known example of the first possibility is the measurement of the total @xmath13 and differential forward elastic cross sections which are related by the optical theorem ; see , for example , @xcite for recent experimental discussions .",
    "this method is discussed further in section 2 .",
    "two types of processes stand out as examples of the second possibility to measure the luminosity .",
    "first there is exclusive lepton - pair production via photon - photon fusion [ eq : g1 ]   +  l^+l^-  + where @xmath14 or @xmath15 . to the best of our knowledge this proposal originated in @xcite .",
    "a luminometer for the lhc based on measuring forward @xmath16 pairs ( of invariant mass @xmath17 mev and transverse momentum @xmath18 mev ) was proposed in @xcite , while ref .",
    "@xcite concerns the central production of @xmath19 pairs ( with @xmath20 20 gev and @xmath21 1050  mev ) .",
    "lepton - pair production is the subject of section 3 .",
    "nowadays attention has also focussed on @xmath2 and @xmath3 production as a possible luminosity monitor , both for run ii at the tevatron and for the lhc see , for example , @xcite .",
    "the reason is that the signal is clean , and the production cross sections are large and can now be calculated with considerable theoretical accuracy .",
    "we discuss this possibility further in section 4 .    in principle",
    ", we may _ monitor _ the luminosity using _ any _ process , with a significant cross section , which is straightforward to detect .",
    "for example , it could be single- ( or two- ) pion inclusive production in some rapidity and @xmath22 domain ( for example @xmath23 ) or inclusive @xmath24 production in a well - defined kinematic domain , etc . in this way",
    "we may control the relative luminosity and then calibrate the monitor  by comparing the number of events detected for the monitor   reaction with the number of events observed for a process with a cross section which is already known , or which may be calculated with sufficient accuracy .",
    "for some applications better accuracy can be achieved by measuring the parton - parton luminosity .",
    "a discussion is given in section  5 .",
    "finally , section  6 contains our conclusions .",
    "first we discuss the classic method to measure the luminosity , that is using the observed total and forward elastic @xmath0 ( or @xmath1 ) event rates . neglecting coulomb effects should be multiplied by the well - known bethe phase @xcite @xmath25 . the uncertainty in bethe phase @xmath26 due to the non - point - like structure ( electric charge distribution ) of the proton is about @xmath27 .",
    "it leads to an uncertainty of about @xmath28 in the re / im ratio , and hence to less than a 0.1% correction for the imaginary part of the strong amplitude @xmath29 .",
    "a recent discussion of the coulomb phase for @xmath30 can be found in @xcite .",
    "] , the elastic cross section is given by [ eq:2a ] .",
    "|_t = 0 = ( 1 + ^2 ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath31 of the real to the imaginary parts of the forward amplitude is small at tevatron - lhc energies and can be estimated via dispersion relation techniques [ eq:2b ] .",
    "for example , at the lhc energy , @xmath32 , it is predicted to be @xmath33 ; for a recent estimate , see , for example , ref .",
    "even the largest conceivable uncertainty in @xmath34 that is @xmath35 , leads only to an uncertainty of less than 0.5% in @xmath36 .",
    "thus if we measure the number of events corresponding to the elastic scattering and to the total cross section , then we may determine both the luminosity @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( since @xmath39 , whereas @xmath40 ) .",
    "the main problem in that it is extremely difficult to make measurements at the lhc in the very forward region , and so it is necessary to extrapolate elastic data from , say , @xmath41 to @xmath42 .    on the other hand it was found at the isr that the observed local  slope [ eq:2c ] b ( t ) depends on @xmath43 . in particular at @xmath44 @xcite [ eq:2d ] b = b ( 0 ) - b ( |t| = 0.2  gev^2 ) 2  gev^-2 .",
    "note that if this @xmath43 dependence were to be solely due to a non - linear pomeron trajectory @xcite , then the difference ( [ eq:2d ] ) would increase as the logarithm of the energy @xmath45 ; giving , for example , @xmath46 at the lhc energy .",
    "the @xmath43-dependence of the local slope @xmath47 has recently been determined @xcite using a model which incorporates all the main features of high energy soft diffraction .",
    "that is the model embodies    * the _ pion - loop _ contribution to the pomeron pole ( which is the main source of the non - linearity of the pomeron trajectory @xmath48 ) , * a _ two - channel _ eikonal to include the pomeron cuts which are generated by elastic and quasi - elastic ( with @xmath49 intermediate states ) @xmath50-channel unitarity , * the effects of high - mass _ diffractive dissociation_.    the parameters of the model are @xmath51 and @xmath52 of the _ bare _ pomeron trajectory , two parameters describing the elastic proton - pomeron vertex , and the triple - pomeron coupling and its slope @xcite .",
    "the values of the parameters were tuned to describe the observed @xmath0 ( or @xmath1 ) elastic differential cross sections throughout the isr - tevatron range , restricting the description to the forward region @xmath53 .",
    "note that there are two effects , leading to a @xmath43 dependence of @xmath54 , which act in opposite directions .",
    "first , the non - linear pion - loop contributions @xcite to the pomeron trajectory , @xmath55 , lead to a contribution @xmath56 in single pomeron exchange , which increases as @xmath57 . on the other hand the absorptive ( rescattering ) corrections , associated with eikonalization , lead to a dip in @xmath58 ( whose position moves to smaller @xmath59 as the collider energy , @xmath60 , increases ) , with the result that the local slope @xmath47 grows as @xmath61 approaches the position of the diffractive minimum ; that is @xmath47 decreases as @xmath57 .",
    "fortunately , just at the lhc energy , these two effects almost compensate each other .",
    "so far it has proved impossible to sum up in a consistent way all the multi - pomeron diagrams .",
    "for this reason two versions of the model were studied in ref .",
    "@xcite with _ maximal _ and _ minimal _ contributions from high - mass diffractive dissociation . after tuning the values of the parameters to describe the @xmath38 and the forward @xmath58 data ,",
    "the two versions of the model predict different values of the slope at @xmath62 .",
    "the maximal choice gives a larger value @xmath63 , while for the minimal case we obtain @xmath64 .",
    "however in both cases the variation of @xmath65 satisfies @xmath66 for @xmath67 , or @xmath68 for the more restricted interval @xmath69 .",
    "it means that we may neglect such a small variation of @xmath47 with @xmath43 and safely extrapolate the observed cross section @xmath58 down to @xmath42 , using the slope measured , say , in the interval @xmath70 .",
    "the error , due to the variation of @xmath54 with @xmath43 , is expected to be less than @xmath71 .    in the very forward region , @xmath72",
    ", it may only be possible to measure the elastic cross section in an lhc run with a rather low luminosity .",
    "for the high luminosity runs one would then have to use another monitor .",
    "one possibility is to choose a single particle inclusive process , with a significant cross section , and calibrate  it in the low luminosity run by comparing with the total and elastic cross sections discussed above",
    ". it would be even better if we were able to calibrate several different reactions .",
    "then to use , as a luminosity monitor , the reaction with the closest topology ( or kinematic configuration ) to the process that we are to study in the high luminosity run .",
    "at first sight any qed process , with sufficient event rate , may be used as a luminosity monitor . up to isr energies the luminosity was measured via coulomb elastic @xmath0 scattering , where at very small @xmath59 the influence of the dominant single photon exchange contribution is evident .",
    "unfortunately , in the lhc environment , the coulomb interference region , @xmath73 is not likely to be experimentally accessible .    other possibilities to consider are @xmath74 isobar coulomb excitation , ( @xmath75 ) , or @xmath76 and @xmath77 production , which are all mediated by photon exchange , as shown in figs .",
    "1(a ) and 2(a ) respectively .",
    "surprisingly , the electromagnetic widths @xmath78 and @xmath79 are known only to 710% accuracy @xcite .",
    "moreover , strong interaction effects in the initial and final states give non - negligible corrections , see figs .",
    "1(b ) and 2(b ) .",
    "lepton pair production looks much more promising as a luminosity monitor .",
    "the born amplitude of fig .",
    "3(a ) may be calculated within pure qed ( see , for example , the reviews in @xcite ) , and there are no strong interactions involving the leptons in the final state .",
    "the only question is the size of the absorptive corrections arising from inelastic proton - proton rescattering , sketched in fig .",
    "fortunately the rescattering correction is suppressed for two reasons .",
    "first , the main part of the born cross section ( fig .",
    "3(a ) ) comes from the peripheral region with large impact parameter @xmath80 , where the strong amplitude @xmath81 is small .",
    "second , even in the small @xmath80 domain , the rescattering correction is greatly suppressed due to the angular integration .",
    "before we discuss the last point , we note that , in practice , it is difficult to exclude contributions coming from the reactions [ eq : f1 ] pp x + l^+ l^- + p + pp x + l^+ l^- + y where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are baryon excitations , that is @xmath49 or @xmath74 isobars .",
    "of course the matrix elements of the corresponding processes ( such as fig .",
    "3(c ) ) can , in principle , be determined from photoproduction and deep inelastic data , and may be taken into account . however the matrix elements of fig .",
    "3(c ) are not known to sufficient accuracy and it is better to suppress the contributions of ( [ eq : f1 ] ) by experimental cuts .",
    "the procedure is as follows .",
    "recall that , due to gauge invariance , inelastic vertices of the type @xmath84 vanish like @xcite [ eq : f2 ] v(p x )  q_1 t as the photon transverse momentum @xmath85 .",
    "unfortunately it is difficult to measure a leading proton with very small transverse momentum , that is @xmath86 .",
    "so to take advantage of the behaviour of ( [ eq : f2 ] ) , it was proposed @xcite to select events with very small transverse momentum of the lepton pair [ eq : f3 ] p_t |  _ l^+t + _",
    "l^-t  | < 10 - 30 mev , in order to suppress @xmath49 and @xmath74 production .",
    "in such a case the integral over the transverse momenta of the photons in the born cross section of fig .",
    "3(a ) takes the form [ eq : f4 ] ^(2 ) ( _ t - _ 1 t - _ 2 t ) d^2 p_t , where the dominant contributions come from the regions @xmath87 .",
    "the values of the longitudinal components are [ eq : f5 ] t_i | t_i , min | = x^2_i m^2_p , where @xmath88 are the fractions of the momenta of the incoming protons carried by the @xmath89 pair , and @xmath90 is the mass of the proton .",
    "to identify muons ( and to separate them from @xmath91 mesons ) it is necessary to observe charged particles after they have transversed a thick ( iron ) absorber .",
    "it means that we consider only muons which have a rather large transverse energy @xmath92 gev .",
    "however , it is still possible to select events where the sum of their transverse momenta is small , @xmath93 mev . in this case",
    "[ eq : f6 ] x_i ( 2 - 3 ) e_t/ 10 ^ -3 ,  t_i 10 ^ -6 gev^2 , at the lhc energy . in such a configuration the main contribution to the integral ( [ eq : f4 ] ) comes from the domains @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "performing the @xmath96 integrations in these two domains gives @xmath97 and @xmath98 respectively , and so the born cross section behaves as [ eq : f7 ]   ln ( )    in addition to the use of the small @xmath22 cut in order to separate the elastic process ( [ eq : g1 ] ) from the excitation process ( [ eq : f1 ] ) , we can also exploit the different kinematics of the processes .",
    "for example in @xcite it was proposed to fit the observed distribution in the muon acoplanarity angle @xmath99 in order to isolate the elastic mechanism via its prominent peak at @xmath100 .",
    "to determine the effect of the absorptive , or re - scattering , correction , we calculate diagram 3(b ) with an extra loop integration over the momentum @xmath102 transferred via the strong interaction amplitude shown by the blob \" .",
    "the relative size of the correction , to the amplitude for lepton - pair production of fig .",
    "3(a ) , is [ eq : f8 ] = , where @xmath103 represents the collective effect of the appropriate proton electromagnetic form factors @xmath104 and the @xmath105 dependence of the strong interaction amplitude [ eq : f8b ] f ( q ) = f_n ( q_1 ^ 2 ) f_n ( q_2 ^ 2 ) f_n ( ( q + q_1)^2 ) f_n ( ( q + q_2)^2 ) e^b q^2/2 .",
    "@xmath106 is the slope of the @xmath0 elastic cross section , that is @xmath107 .",
    "we can interpret the correction @xmath108 in terms of @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the survival probability amplitude  that the secondary hadrons produced in the soft rescattering do not accompany @xmath111 production .",
    "of course this effect is due to the inelastic strong interaction only . consider the hypothetical case with pure elastic @xmath0 rescattering ( at fixed impact parameter @xmath80 , that is for fixed partial wave @xmath112 ) .",
    "then elastic rescattering only changes the phase of the qed matrix element , @xmath113 , and does not alter the qed cross section @xmath114 .",
    "thus we have to account only for the inelasticity of the strong interaction , that is @xmath115 as in ( [ eq : f8 ] ) is that we have to sum up multiple @xmath0 rescattering . on resumming all the eikonal graphs ,",
    "it turns out that one obtains ( [ eq : f8 ] ) with @xmath116 . ] . throughout this paper",
    "we do not discuss the effects of pile - up  events .",
    "thus there will be an additional factor @xmath117 which represents the probability not to include events with extra secondaries coming from an almost simultaneous interaction of another pair of protons .",
    "experimentally the depletion due to such pile - up events may be overcome , for example , by cleanly observing the vertex of @xmath24 production .    the cross section @xmath118 in ( [ eq : f8 ] )",
    "plays the role of the cross section for the qed subprocess of @xmath119 scattering through the lepton box . for the absorptive process",
    ", the photons have momenta @xmath120 and @xmath121 in the left `` amplitude @xmath122 shown in fig .",
    "3(b ) , and @xmath123 in the right '' amplitude @xmath124 , which is not shown . here",
    "we have assigned the absorptive effect to @xmath122 .",
    "actually the numerator of ( [ eq : f8 ] ) , and the symbolic )  the only qualification is that when the photon is emitted inside the ladder , the form factor @xmath104 may have different behaviour at large @xmath125 . in our case , when @xmath125 is very small , this effect is negligible . ]",
    "diagram 3(b ) , summarize a set of feynman graphs which describe the effects of the strong interaction between the protons in the amplitude @xmath122 .",
    "then we have to add the equivalent set of diagrams in which the rescattering effects occur in the amplitude @xmath124 . the total correction to ( [ eq : f7 ] )",
    "is therefore @xmath126 .",
    "the rescattering correction is due to the imaginary part of the strong amplitude only .",
    "the effects coming from the real part in @xmath122 cancel with those in @xmath124 .    at first sight",
    "the largest absorptive effects , ( [ eq : f8 ] ) , appear to come from the largest values of @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the proton radius ; higher values of @xmath125 are cut - off by the proton form factor .",
    "however when @xmath129 an interesting suppression occurs . in this domain @xmath130 occurs dominantly in the @xmath131 two - photon state .",
    "the projection of the orbital angular momentum on the longitudinal @xmath132 axis is clearly zero , while the spin ( which originates from the photon polarisations ) is described by the tensor @xmath133 .",
    "after the azimuthal integration , the tensor takes the form @xmath134 , leading to @xmath131 .",
    "if we neglect the mass of the lepton , @xmath135 , and higher order qed corrections , then the born amplitude , with @xmath131 , vanishes by pumplin @xcite , see also @xcite . ] .",
    "this is a well known result , see , for example , @xcite . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the physical origin of the suppression is related to the symmetry properties of the @xmath131 born amplitude .",
    "the cross section  @xmath136 for our qed subprocess depends on the transverse momenta of four virtual photons .",
    "the full expression for @xmath118 is rather complicated .",
    "however in the limit @xmath137 we can integrate over the direction of the lepton transverse momentum @xmath138 ( with @xmath139 ) , and the formula reduces to the simple form [ eq : f9 ]   where the notation @xmath140 is used for the scalar product of two _ transverse _ vectors , and where the rapidity difference [ eq : f10 ] | ( l^+ ) - ( l^- ) | .    it is interesting to note that the dependence of the cross section @xmath118 on @xmath141 and @xmath125 follows directly from the symmetry properties of the process .",
    "first , gauge invariance implies that @xmath118 must vanish when the transverse momentum of any photon goes to zero . that is @xmath118 must contain a factor @xmath142 .",
    "next , it has to be symmetric under the interchanges @xmath143 and @xmath144 . finally , as discussed above , in the limit @xmath145",
    ", it must vanish after the azimuthal angular integration of @xmath146 has been performed . the only possibility to satisfy these conditions , to lowest order in @xmath147 and @xmath148 , is given by the expression in square brackets in ( [ eq : f9 ] ) . to obtain the @xmath149 and @xmath150 behaviour , shown in the first factor in @xmath118 of ( [ eq : f9 ] )",
    ", it is sufficient to put @xmath151 and to recall the well known pure qed cross section ) for @xmath118 . ] .",
    "recall that for @xmath19 production we select events with small transverse momentum of the lepton pair , @xmath22 . now",
    "if @xmath152 , that is if @xmath153 , then the last factor in expression ( [ eq : f9 ] ) of the absorptive cross section simplifies to [ eq : f11 ]   , which , upon integration over the azimuthal angle of the vector @xmath154 , gives zero . therefore the main contribution to ( [ eq : f8 ] ) comes from values of @xmath155 , and the absorptive correction [ eq : f12 ]  p^2_t  c. the coefficient @xmath156 is numerically small for two reasons . first , the integration over the loop momentum @xmath125 kills the logarithmic factor , ln@xmath157 , which enhanced the original cross section ( [ eq : f7 ] ) in the absence of absorptive corrections . to see this , note that the @xmath158 came from the @xmath159 integrations , for both @xmath160 and @xmath161 , of ( [ eq : f4 ] ) , see ( [ eq : f7 ] )",
    "however when @xmath162 the integrands are of the form @xmath163 , and there is no logarithmic singularity for either @xmath164 or @xmath165 .",
    "second , there is a suppression of @xmath156 from cancellations which occur after integration over the remaining azimuthal angles .",
    "for example , if the invariant mass of the @xmath24 pair produced at zero rapidity is @xmath166 , then the value of the coefficient @xmath167 and 0.08 for @xmath168 and 50  mev respectively .",
    "this leads to a negligible correction to the cross section ( [ eq : f7 ] ) , for example [ eq : f13 ] 2  p^2_t  c < 0.02%  ( 0.13% ) for @xmath169 mev",
    "( 30  mev ) .",
    "note that the rescattering contribution of fig .",
    "3(b ) is less singular as @xmath170 than the pure qed term of fig .",
    "therefore the rescattering correction does not induce a sharp peak at @xmath100 in the muon acoplanarity distribution . thus removing the excitation processes ( [ eq : f1 ] ) by fitting the @xmath99 distribution ,",
    "will automatically suppress the rescattering correction .",
    "unlike @xmath24 production , for @xmath171 production we do not need to select events with electrons of large transverse momentum @xmath172 . providing the energy of the electrons @xmath173",
    ", we may use , say , an electromagnetic calorimeter to identify them .",
    "therefore we may consider the small @xmath172 domain where the @xmath171 production cross section is much larger .",
    "the dominant contribution to the cross section comes from the region of @xmath172 of the order of the electron mass ( @xmath174 mev ) . as @xmath172 is small",
    ", we can not neglect @xmath125 in the @xmath43 channel electron propogator . as a consequence the integral over @xmath125 becomes super - convergent [ eq : f14 ] .",
    "it is informative to note the origin of this form . due to gauge invariance ,",
    "the numerator vanishes when the photon transverse momenta @xmath175 .",
    "the first two factors in the denominator arise from the photon propagators .",
    "finally we have the factor due to the electron propagator , with @xmath176 .",
    "contrary to @xmath24 production , where the lepton propagator was driven by the large @xmath177 of the muon , here the momentum @xmath125 is not negigible in comparison with @xmath172 and the dominant contribution comes from the region @xmath178  gev@xmath179 .",
    "hence the expected absorptive correction due to strong interaction rescattering is [ eq : f15 ] 2  q^2_t ~  10 ^ - 6 gev^2 10 ^ -5      we see that both @xmath19 and @xmath16 pair production may be used as monitor processes in high luminosity lhc collisions .",
    "however we must employ special selection cuts on the @xmath101 data . to suppress @xmath49 contamination",
    "we impose small transverse momentum @xmath22 of the lepton pair , moreover for @xmath16 production we require the individual electron @xmath172 to be small .",
    "we also require the leptons to be sufficiently energetic in order to identify them .",
    "then the cross section for @xmath101 production at the lhc @xmath180 can be calculated within pure qed and , _ importantly _ , we may neglect the strong rescattering effects between the protons up to @xmath181 accuracy .",
    "of course by requiring the muons to have high @xmath150 we have a rather small cross section .",
    "however here we may trace back the muon tracks and determine the interaction vertex , and hence isolate the interaction in pile - up events .",
    "so , in principle , @xmath19 pair production , with high @xmath150 muons , may be used as a luminometer in very high luminosity lhc runs .",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 production in high energy @xmath0 and @xmath1 collisions have clean signatures through their leptonic decay modes , @xmath182 and @xmath183 , and so may be considered as potential luminosity monitors @xcite .",
    "a vital ingredient is the accuracy to which the cross sections for @xmath2 and @xmath3 production can be theoretically calculated .",

    "the uncertainty in the nnlo predictions of @xmath189 and @xmath190 due to the residual ambiguity in the splitting functions is shown by the width of the nnlo bands in fig .",

    "however let us turn to figs .  5 and 6 ,",
    "each of which combine results presented in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the solid squares and triangles show the additional uncertainty in the predictions for @xmath189 and @xmath190 which arise from changing the input information in the global parton analyses .",
    "the two major uncertainties appear to be due to the value of @xmath184 and to using different parton densities labelled by q@xmath198 and q@xmath199 .",
    "the plots show the change in @xmath189 and @xmath190 which is caused by changing the value of @xmath200 by @xmath201 respectively .",
    "the change in @xmath189 and @xmath190 at the lhc energy is enhanced as compared to that at the tevatron , since dglap evolution is more rapid at the smaller @xmath202 values , @xmath203 , probed at the higher energy . however , with our present knowledge of @xmath184 , the uncertainty @xmath204 is too conservative , and @xmath205 is a more realistic uncertainty in @xmath193 from this source at the lhc energy .",
    "the normalisation of the input data used in the global parton analyses is another source of uncertainty in @xmath193 .",
    "the hera experiments provide almost all of the data used in the global analyses in the relevant small @xmath202 domain .",
    "the quoted normalisation uncertainties of the measurements of the proton structure function @xmath206 from the h1 and zeus experiments vary with @xmath105 , but a mean value of @xmath207 is appropriate .",
    "the q@xmath198 and q@xmath199 parton sets correspond to separate global fits in which the hera data have been renormalised by @xmath207 respectively . for @xmath2 and @xmath3 production , of @xmath208 origin",
    ", we naively would expect this to translate into a @xmath209 variation in @xmath193 , but the effect of dglap evolution up to @xmath210 is to suppress the difference in the predictions .    in summary , allowing for all the above uncertainties , we conclude that the cross sections of @xmath2 and @xmath3 production are known to @xmath211 at the lhc energy , and to @xmath212 at the tevatron .",
    "a major contributer to this error is the uncertainty in the overall normalisation of the h1 and zeus measurements of @xmath206 .",
    "the normalisation may be made more precise by experiments in run ii at the tevatron .",
    "in some circumstances it is sufficient to know the parton - parton luminosity , and not the proton - proton luminosity , see , for example , @xcite . of course",
    "if the proton - proton luminosity is known then the parton - parton luminosities can be calculated from the parton distributions determined in the global parton analyses .",
    "however in this case we rely on the normalisation of experiments at previous accelerators which yielded data that were used in the global analyses",
    ".    thus it may be better to monitor the parton - parton luminosities directly in terms of a subprocess which can be predicted theoretically to high precision .",
    "the best example is inclusive @xmath2 ( or @xmath3 ) boson production , which is predicted up to two - loops , that is to nnlo @xcite .",
    "the accurate observation of @xmath2 ( or @xmath3 ) production at the lhc may therefore be used to determine the quark - antiquark luminosity luminosity in a given @xmath213 bin may be obtained by observing the number of @xmath2 events in that bin and dividing by the @xmath214 cross section . however at nlo",
    "we include @xmath215 etc .",
    ", so the only possibility is to use the new @xmath2 data to determine the @xmath208 luminosity within a global parton analysis .",
    "to do the same at nnlo we would require the nnlo expression for @xmath216 , where @xmath217 is the rapidity of the decay lepton . ] .",
    "then the gluon flux , for example , may be determined from the global parton analysis which already is made to describe the measured @xmath2 ( or @xmath3 ) cross sections .",
    "one advantage of this technique is that , for most lhc applications such as the search for new heavy particles , we need to consider a smaller interval of dglap evolution than has been the practice hitherto .    other ways to constrain the gluon - gluon luminosity are to study @xmath218 production or the production of two large @xmath22 prompt photons .",
    "the leading order subprocess is @xmath219 .",
    "however at lhc energies the @xmath220 box diagram gives an important contribution .",
    "the two diagrams are shown in fig .",
    "the relative contributions are shown in fig .",
    "8 as a function of the transverse momentum of the photon pair @xmath221 for the case when each photon has transverse momentum @xmath222 and rapidity @xmath223 .",
    "we see that in this kinematic domain the @xmath224 subprocess gives a major contribution due to the higher @xmath225 luminosity .",
    "however there is a strong possibility of contamination by the subprocess @xmath226 , unless severe photon isolation cuts are imposed , see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "so far we have considered conventional parton distributions @xmath227 integrated over the parton transverse momentum @xmath228 up to the factorization scale @xmath15 .",
    "however many reactions are described by unintegrated distributions @xmath229 which depend on both @xmath228 and the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath202 carried by the parton . in principle , unintegrated distributions are necessary for the description of all processes which are not totally inclusive . in these cases , instead of the conventional qcd factorization",
    ", we have @xmath228 factorization @xcite .",
    "indeed , for some processes , after the specific integration over @xmath228 , the conventional hard  qcd factorization may be destroyed .",
    "the unintegrated quark - quark luminosity may be determined , for example , by observing the @xmath228 distribution of @xmath2 ( or @xmath3 ) bosons or drell - yan pairs . at leading order ,",
    "the @xmath228-dependence of cross sections is given by the convolution [ eq:2e ] ^(2 ) ( _ 1 + _ 2 - _ t ) f_q ( x_1 , p_1 ^ 2 , ^2 ) f_|q ( x_2 , p_2 ^ 2 , ^2 ) .",
    "at large @xmath230 , to leading @xmath231 order , the dominant contribution comes from either the domain @xmath232 or the domain @xmath233 .",
    "it is natural to choose the factorization scale @xmath234 .",
    "then the @xmath228 distribution takes the simple form",
    "@xcite [ eq:2f ] , since at leading order [ eq:2 g ] ^k_t^2 f_a ( x , p^2 , k_t^2 ) = xa ( x , k_t^2 ) . moreover diffractive processes ( with one or more rapidity gaps ) are described , in general , by skewed parton distributions .",
    "an example is the double - diffractive exclusive higgs boson production , described by the feynman diagram shown in fig .",
    "this process is described by skewed gluon distributions with @xmath235 and @xmath236 @xcite .",
    "sometimes even the skewed  parton flux can be monitored directly via another process with similar kinematics .",
    "for example , we may monitor the effective pomeron - pomeron luminosity for higgs production of fig .",
    "9 by measuring double- diffractive dijet production in the region in which the transverse energy of the jets ( @xmath150 ) is of about half that of the higgs mass @xmath237 @xcite .",
    "fortunately most of the physically relevant processes are described by skewed distributions with @xmath238 . in these cases the skewed distributions",
    "may be reliably reconstructed from the known conventional parton distributions @xcite .",
    "we have studied the theoretical accuracy of the main three proposals for determining the luminosity of the lhc @xmath0 collider  namely using forward elastic data , lepton - pair production and @xmath2 or @xmath3 boson production .",
    "the desired goal of a measurement to within @xmath239 seems theoretically attainable .",
    "we focused on potential shortcomings of each method .",
    "first , we demonstrated that the @xmath43 dependence of the elastic cross section is well under control and , in fact , it turns out that it can be safely approximated by a simple exponential in the region @xmath240 . for lepton - pair production we evaluated the corrections to the cross section arising from the strong interactions between the protons .",
    "we showed that in the relevant kinematic domain , with small transverse momentum of the produced lepton - pair , these effects are negligible .",
    "hence a pure qed calculation of the cross section will give sufficient accuracy .",
    "the cross sections for @xmath2 and @xmath3 production can now be predicted to nnlo , which at first sight would seem to provide an lhc luminometer with @xmath191 accuracy , see fig .",
    "however the uncertainties in the input to the global parton analyses mean that the error could , conservatively , be as large as @xmath241",
    ". the uncertainty may be reduced if we work in terms of quark - antiquark luminosity , which is relevant in some future applications of the lhc .",
    "finally , we note that luminosity determinations based on the measurement of the forward elastic cross section and ( most probably ) on two - photon @xmath171 production can only be made in low luminosity runs , and require dedicated detectors and triggers . on the other hand ,",
    "the measurement of @xmath2 or @xmath3 and two - photon @xmath24 production may be performed at high luminosity with the central detector and with standard triggers .",
