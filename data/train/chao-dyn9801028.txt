    "one - dimensional iterative maps represent a very useful tool to understand the physics of complex nonlinear systems . in particular they can be used to investigate the different routes of nonlinear dynamical systems from regular to chaotic behaviour @xcite to simulate physical systems showing anomalous diffusion @xcite or to analyse the underlying dynamics in time series with @xmath0 noise in their power spectrum @xcite . in many cases and in particular from an experimental point of view the only information available for a physical system are its statistical properties ( ergodic measure or time correlation function ) and one is asked to design a consistent dynamical law . in a recent paper @xcite we examined the possibility to construct an one dimensional discrete dynamical system with a given invariant density .",
    "this is the so called inverse frobenius - perron problem ( ifpp ) @xcite .",
    "it could be shown that using certain symmetry requirements the ifpp possesses a unique solution .",
    "we applied our method to calculate numerically the symmetric unimodal maps with the invariant density given by the symmetric beta distribution .",
    "however the solution presented in @xcite is a partial and very specialized one .",
    "depending on the chosen symmetry constraints we can get an infinite number of such solutions . in the present paper we go one step further and present the general solution to the ifpp within the class of unimodal maps . a central role",
    "is hereby played by the function @xmath1 which parametrizes the space of the solutions to the ifpp .",
    "this solution enables us to explore in depth the connection between the dynamics and statistics in one - dimensional systems .",
    "our investigations concentrate on the wide family of the beta distributions .",
    "the ifpp is solved for the asymmetric case when the two exponents in the expression for the density are unequal . from the general solution we obtain two special solutions using two different forms for the function @xmath1 .",
    "we then calculate the time - correlation functions and the power spectra of the corresponding dynamical systems . the question of the dependence of the statistical characteristics ( singularities of the density , long time behaviour of the autocorrelation function ) of these systems on their dynamical characteristics ( critical points ) is addressed .",
    "next we compare for a given density the dependence of the statistical properties on the form of the function @xmath1 .",
    "a large variety of the statistical and dynamical behaviour is obtained .",
    "some theoretical predictions concerning the asymptotic decay of the correlations or the value of the lyapunov exponents @xcite in fully chaotic dynamical systems can be tested within the class of our examples .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we present the general solution to the ifpp within the class of unimodal maps . in section",
    "iii we derive from the general solution of section ii a wide family of unimodal maps having as invariant density the beta distribution .",
    "this family of maps corresponds to two special solutions of the ifpp : the symmetric betamap ( sb ) and the special asymmetric betamap ( sab ) . in section",
    "iv we discuss the main characteristics of the maps belonging to the beta family and we study the rich dynamical behaviour which they provide . in section v we calculate the autocorrelation function , the power spectrum and the liapunov exponent for representative members of the beta family .",
    "a connection between the dynamics and the asymptotic decay of correlations is established .",
    "some theoretical models explaining this behaviour are tested .",
    "finally section vi contains the conclusions and gives a brief outlook with respect to the inclusion of the correlation behaviour into the inverse frobenius - perron problem .",
    "let us consider the variety of dynamical systems which belong to an arbitrary but fixed invariant density .",
    "the solution to this inverse problem is of great interest for the numerical simulation of real physical systems as well as the understanding of the relationship between the functional form of the map and the statistical features of its resulting dynamics . in the present section",
    "we establish a general representation of all ergodic and chaotic unimodal maps with a given invariant density .",
    "this corresponds to the general representation of the solution of the so called inverse frobenius - perron problem ( ifpp ) @xcite within this class of maps .",
    "the starting - equation for the construction of the map is the frobenius - perron equation :    @xmath2    where the summation runs over all preimages of @xmath3 ( for unimodal maps @xmath4 ) . for any given unimodal @xmath5 the right or left preimage of @xmath3",
    "is determined , once the corresponding other one is given .",
    "the essential feature of our approach is the inversion of this expression : a prescribed relation between the two preimages reduces the number of independent differentials on the rhs of eq.([froperequ ] ) and allows a following integration .",
    "such a relation may be described by a function @xmath6 , mapping the left preimage onto the right one :    @xmath7\\longrightarrow[x_{\\max},1 ] \\nonumber \\\\",
    "x_r&=&h_f(x_l)\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\mbox{with}\\;\\;f(x_l)=f(x_r ) \\label{hfprei}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath8 is the position of the maximum of the unimodal map .",
    "@xmath6 is a function monotonously decreasing on the defining interval and it is differentiable with the exception of a finite number of points .",
    "it obeys the equations :    @xmath9 \\nonumber \\\\",
    "h_f(0)=1   & & \\;\\;\\;\\;h_f(x_{\\max})=x_{\\max } \\label{hfprop}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    substituting @xmath1 in eq.([froperequ ] )",
    "yields :    @xmath10    using the definition @xmath11 for the invariant measure eq.([newfp ] ) can be integrated in @xmath12 providing us with the left part @xmath13}$ ] of the map @xmath5 :    @xmath14 \\label{leftp}\\ ] ]    with @xmath15 being invertible and normalized , i.e. @xmath16 .",
    "the right part of the map , @xmath17}$ ] , is obtained by substitution of @xmath18 in eq.([leftp ] ) .",
    "it follows that the map @xmath5 parametrised through the function @xmath6 and characterised by the invariant measure @xmath15 , is given by :    @xmath19&0 \\leq x < x_{\\max}\\\\      \\mu^{-1}[\\mu(h^{-1}_f(x))-\\mu(x)+1]&x_{\\max}\\leq x \\leq 1\\\\               \\end{array}\\right\\}=1-|\\mu(x)-\\mu(h_f(x))| \\label{funx}\\ ] ]    where @xmath20 is given by : @xmath21 with the above eq.([funx ] ) we have found an interesting representation and answer to the ifpp which is the central topic of this paper : all unimodal maps with prescribed invariant measure are given by ( [ funx ] ) , @xmath6 taking on all possible functional forms obeying ( [ hfprei ] ) and ( [ hfprop ] ) .",
    "this shows that a fixed invariant measure is a relatively weak constraint to a solution of the inverse problem and there is still a considerable freedom to model the mapping .    before we apply our method to analyse specific examples we mention an interesting connection between this approach and the approach via conjugation transformations which can also be applied to construct a map with an arbitrary given ( in general nonsymmetric ) invariant density . to our knowledge",
    "the conjugation transformation method has been applied in the literature only to the restricted case of the construction of a symmetric map with prescribed invariant density @xcite .",
    "we will show below how this approach can be extented to include all unimodal maps .",
    "first we recall the basic features of the conjugation transformation approach .",
    "more details can be found in the literature @xcite . using as a basis the tent map given by : @xmath22 and applying the conjugation transformation @xmath23 with @xmath24 for all @xmath25 $ ] and with the additional property @xmath26 ( antisymmetric with respect @xmath27 ) we can span the space of all doubly symmetric maps ( symmetric maps and symmetric invariant densities ) .",
    "the invariant density of the transformed map @xmath28 is then : @xmath29 . to arrive in an analogous way at a nonsymmetric density",
    "while the map remains symmetric we have to use a generalized conjugation transformation : @xmath30 for symmetric @xmath5 the function @xmath31 must also be symmetric : @xmath32 .",
    "the two constraints , i.e. that the invariant density of the resulting map @xmath5 is a prescribed function @xmath33 and that @xmath5 is symmetric , determine uniquely the transformation functions : @xmath34 . defining the symmetric @xmath35 and antisymmetric parts @xmath36 ( with @xmath37 ) of the invariant measure @xmath15 we find : @xmath38 . using the fact that : @xmath39 we get the following expression for the desired map @xmath5 : @xmath40 \\label{mapcon}\\ ] ] comparing equations ( [ funx ] ) and ( [ mapcon ] )",
    "we see that they are compatible provided that @xmath41 , which corresponds to the correct choice of @xmath1 in ( [ funx ] ) for a symmetric solution @xmath5 .",
    "we can now extend the conjugation transformation approach in order to determine also nonsymmetric maps with a given invariant density .",
    "for the derivation of eq.([mapcon ] ) we have used a decomposition of the invariant measure in a symmetric and an antisymmetric part ( with respect to @xmath8 ) .",
    "this decomposition leads us to a symmetric solution .",
    "a general decomposition @xmath42 obeying @xmath43 is given in the following . in the case of unimodal maps",
    "we introduce the following components of the measure @xmath15 : @xmath44 with @xmath20 given in eq.([genhf ] ) . using the generalized conjugation transformation of eq.([genconj ] ) with @xmath45 and @xmath46",
    "we get the solution of eq.([funx ] ) to the ifpp . thus conjugation transformations of the form of eq.([genconj ] ) with @xmath34 chosen as in eq.([gendec ] ) span the entire space of unimodal maps with a given invariant density @xmath33 .",
    "the method to construct an one - dimensional unimodal map with a prescribed invariant density , as proposed in the previous section , applies for all possible forms of the invariant measure @xmath15 and the invariant density @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "nevertheless we want to consider a special class of particularly relevant invariant densities @xmath33 , namely the two - parametric beta - distribution : @xmath47 these densities are important due to their widespread occurence and applicability ( for example in turbulent reacting flows , diffusion in disordered media , image classification see refs.@xcite ) as well as their simple form . the special case of a symmetric density @xmath48 with a symmetric solution , i.e. a map obeying @xmath49 , which is unique , has been already discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "we call this solution the doubly symmetric beta - map ( dsb ) . in the present paper",
    "we discuss the general case of an asymmetric invariant density @xmath50 .",
    "we focus on two solutions of the ifpp with this general asymmetric invariant density , both of which are identical to the dsb in the case @xmath51 :    * the first solution is symmetric @xmath49 .",
    "we call it the symmetric beta - map ( sb ) .",
    "* the second solution obeys the following constraint : @xmath52 which is only possible if @xmath53 .",
    "we call this solution the special asymmetric beta - map ( sab ) .",
    "in fig.1 we show an example of such a map for the case @xmath54 . the corresponding invariant density is also presented and the notation regarding the imposed constraint of eq.([sab ] )",
    "is explained .    in the following we consider only examples where both @xmath55 and @xmath56 possess the same sign , i.e. the above criterion is fulfiled",
    "these two types of solutions correspond of course to two different choices for the form of the function @xmath6 . for the case of the sb",
    "we have @xmath41 .",
    "the second case is more delicate .",
    "it corresponds to an implicitly defined @xmath6 . from the condition in eq.([sab ] ) and eq.([betden ] ) we find : @xmath57 where @xmath58 .",
    "eq.([hfimp ] ) defines @xmath1 and can be solved parametrically . using @xmath59 we get : @xmath60 with @xmath61 .",
    "let us now apply the theoretical considerations of section ii to derive the expressions for the two types of beta - maps refered above .",
    "the invariant measure corresponding to the density ( [ betden ] ) is : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the incomplete beta function @xcite . using eq.([leftp ] ) we can determine implicitly the left branch of the solution of the ifpp : @xmath64 and a similar expression results also for @xmath65 : @xmath66 to get the two special solutions refered above we have to substitute in eqs.([bleft],[bright ] ) the suitable @xmath1 . as we already mentioned for the sb",
    "we choose @xmath67 .",
    "taking into account this special form of @xmath1 and the fact that the eqs.([bleft],[bright ] ) are valid for @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively ( for sb @xmath27 ) , we can recast eqs.([bleft ] , [ bright ] ) into a single equation : @xmath70 \\label{sbmap}\\ ] ] with @xmath71 for @xmath72 and @xmath73 for @xmath74 . to calculate the value of the sb for a given x we have to solve eq.([sbmap ] ) numerically using a standard root finding routine .",
    "it turns out that the bisection method @xcite is well suited for a fast and accurate determination of @xmath75 . in fig.2a",
    "we present 4 characteristic members of the class of symmetric beta - maps calculated numerically using ( [ sbmap ] ) .",
    "let us now return to the sab case .",
    "the calculation of the map @xmath76 is a little more tedious . for a given @xmath77 we use eq.([hfimp ] ) to find numerically @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) if @xmath68 ( if @xmath69 ) . note that for the sab @xmath80 .",
    "the numerical solution to eq.([hfimp ] ) can be easily obtained using the bisection method .",
    "then we apply eq.([funx ] ) to determine @xmath76 : @xmath81 again we have to find the root @xmath76 of eq.([sabmap ] ) numerically using the bisection method .",
    "we emphasize that the bisection procedure in solving eq.([sabmap ] ) could be circumvented in the case that the inverse of the incomplete beta function @xmath82 is given explicitly .",
    "the calculated sab maps , for the same choice of the values of @xmath55 and @xmath56 as in fig.2a , are presented in fig.2b .    for both types of maps sb and",
    "sab a dynamical route to the fully chaotic and ergodic state can be constructed applying the method described in @xcite .",
    "using the numerical solutions to eqs.([sbmap],[sabmap ] ) we calculated trajectories for the corresponding maps for different values of the parameters @xmath55 and @xmath56 . averaging over a long trajectory of each map we reproduced with a good agreement the invariant densities given as the input for the construction of these maps .",
    "we mention that , due to computational accuracy reasons , for @xmath83 values close to @xmath84 it is necessary to calculate @xmath85 instead of @xmath3 in that range of @xmath77 for which @xmath86 .",
    "finally let us introduce the concept of the complementary beta - map , cb .",
    "two maps @xmath87 and @xmath88 belonging to sb or sab are called complementary , if their invariant densities @xmath33 and @xmath89 are transformed into each other by changing @xmath77 to @xmath90 .",
    "considering the frobenius - perron equation , which is the starting point for the construction of both sb and sab maps , the following relation can be derived : @xmath91= b\\left[\\beta+1,\\alpha+1,\\tilde{y}(1-x)\\right ] \\label{betcom}\\ ] ] complementary maps agree with respect to certain dynamical features , e.g. the lyapunov - exponent , as shown below .",
    "many features of the dynamics generated by a discrete map do not depend on the dynamical law as a whole , but only on its local behaviour in certain regions of the phase space .",
    "in particular for the case of unimodal maps the order of the maximum turns out to be responsible for some interesting quantities characterising the underlying dynamics like the singularities of the invariant density at @xmath92 and @xmath93 , the decay constant of the autocorrelation and the scaling parameter of the feigenbaum bifurcation route @xcite .",
    "the order @xmath94 of a map at its maximum @xmath95 , is defined as the exponent in the approximation : @xmath96 in an analogous way we can define the order of the map at the end points : @xmath97 . in the following we will determine the corresponding exponents @xmath98 for the sb and sab . + * ( a ) the sb case * + one can easily utilise the frobenius - perron - equation @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the sb - map . for @xmath101 the nominator on",
    "the rhs is finite which yields @xmath102 assuming @xmath103 to be the order of the map in the maximum , i.e. @xmath104 one gets @xmath105 expanding eq.([sbmap ] ) around the points @xmath92 and @xmath93 and taking into account that @xmath106 for @xmath107 or @xmath108 we find the exponents @xmath109 and @xmath110 to be : @xmath111    * ( b ) the sab case * + determining the order of the sab at its maximum @xmath112 turns out to be slightly more complicated compared to the case of the sb due to the implicit form of @xmath1 .",
    "the derivative @xmath113 of the sab @xmath100 is given by the frobenius - perron equation . in terms of the parametric solution @xmath114 , @xmath115 of eq.([deflam ] )",
    "we get : @xmath116 the limit @xmath117 corresponds to the limit of the above equation for @xmath118 .",
    "higher derivatives @xmath119 are obtained by differentiating @xmath120 with respect to @xmath121 and subsequent dividing by @xmath122 or @xmath123 , respectively .",
    "the leading behaviour of the left or right derivative @xmath124 for @xmath125 ( which corresponds to @xmath117 ) is given by : @xmath126 a straightforward but tedious calculations shows that @xmath127 the exponent of @xmath128 vanishes for a value @xmath129 which gives the order @xmath130 of the sab at the maximum .",
    "expanding eq.([sabmap ] ) around the endpoints @xmath97 we get : @xmath131    acoording to the behaviour of the sb and the sab near the characteristic points @xmath132 we can classify the forms of maps which we obtain for different values of @xmath55 and @xmath56 as follows :    * the region @xmath133 : the order of the map at @xmath8 , given by @xmath134 , is a common quantity for all beta - maps",

    "the map itself has a convex shape . as the maximum of the sab is in @xmath142 $ ]",
    ", the right branch of the map , containing the unstable fixed point , is more shallow than that of the corresponding sb map . *",
    "* @xmath143 , @xmath144 : + at @xmath92 , both the sb as well as the sab map develop a slope @xmath145 which enables them to generate intermittent dynamics . since the sb are symmetric we have @xmath146 .",
    "the derivatives of the sab maps however show divergent behaviour , @xmath147 + the sb and sab maps are identical to the dsb for @xmath51 .",

    "the dynamics generated by both the sab and the sb result in singularities of the invariant density at @xmath97 for @xmath157 . although the strengths of these singularities can be directly read from eq.([betden ] ) it is of interest to explore how they are determined through the order of the map at the maximum and at the endpoints @xmath158 .",
    "the strength of the singularity at @xmath93 is determined by the order of the maximum only . as the order of the map for both sb and sab at its maximum is given by @xmath159 , the expansion of the map in this region reads @xmath160 near @xmath8",
    "the invariant measure is a smooth function . using eq.([froperequ ] )",
    "we can therefore write @xmath161 .",
    "the dependence of the differential @xmath162 on @xmath77 is given by @xmath163 .",
    "if we now make the ansatz @xmath164 for the invariant density at @xmath165 , the frobenius - perron equation in orders of @xmath77 reads @xmath166 we therefore conclude that the strength of the singularity of the invariant density at @xmath93 for both types of maps ( sb and sab ) is given implicitly by the order of the dynamic law at its maximum .",
    "the determination of the singularity at @xmath92 is more intricate .",
    "we will study in detail the case of the sb maps .",
    "the sab maps can be treated in an analogous way . for the sb family",
    "the frobenius - perron equation can be written in the form : @xmath167\\:|dx|,\\ ] ] using eq.([sbor01 ] ) the sb at @xmath168 is approximately given by @xmath169 .",
    "let us make the ansatz @xmath170 for the singularity of the invariant density at @xmath171 . for @xmath168 @xmath33 and @xmath172 possess the singularities @xmath173 and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "therefore the frobenius - perron equation reads @xmath174 @xmath175 two cases have to be considered :    * the first possibility is @xmath176 . in this case eq.([sbsi0 ] ) yields @xmath177 and therefore @xmath178 with the solution @xmath179 .",
    "the singularity at @xmath92 is given by the parameter @xmath55 as expected .",
    "* the case @xmath180 demands slightly more attention .",
    "the order of the map in @xmath92 and @xmath93 is one , according to eq.([sbor01 ] ) .",
    "this makes the dynamics a candidate for intermittency , which is characterised by an expansion of the map near a marginally unstable fixed point of the form @xmath181 the order of the next - to leading term , @xmath182 , determines essentially the statistical properties of the dynamical law near @xmath92 . in ref.@xcite",
    "it was shown , that a symmetric map , with a maximum of order @xmath94 and of the form ( [ intmap ] ) at @xmath92 , generates an invariant density , which has a singularity of the order @xmath183 at @xmath92 . using the implicit representation of the sb map : @xmath184 and expanding the incomplete beta - functions around @xmath92 with the help of the formula : @xmath185 we find : @xmath186",
    "it follows that : @xmath187 therefore the term next to the leading one is of order @xmath188 .",
    "using eq.([sing0 ] ) and @xmath159 we find @xmath189 , i.e. the correct strength of the singularity at @xmath92 is reproduced .    at the end of this section",
    "let us discuss the different kinds of dynamics which are generated by the different types of maps in the two classes sab and sb .",
    "depending on the values of @xmath55 and @xmath56 , there are two eyecatching types of dynamical behaviour :    * @xmath190 + the trajectories of both sb and sab maps are characterised by an oscillatory motion around the unstable fixed point in the right interval of monotony of the map .",
    "the orbit leaves the region close to the fixed point , where the linear approximation of the map is valid , exponentially fast .",
    "this phase of the dynamics is highly correlated .",
    "the time which a corresponding trajectory spends in the neighbourhood of the unstable fixed point is for sab maps typically larger than for sb maps .",
    "the reason for this is the fact that the derivations of the sab maps are usually in a larger region closer to @xmath84 than those of the sb maps . after leaving this regime",
    "we encounter an oscillatory motion of the orbit about the maximum . in this case",
    "the left and the right branch of the map are visited alternately . as the parts of the map visited",
    "are nearly symmetric with respect to the axis @xmath191 , a nearly stable orbit with period two occurs",
    ". this peculiar feature of the map is more common for the sb maps .",
    "the two singularities of the invariant density are build up by these oscillations .",
    "as the centre of the oscillations is shifted to the right of @xmath192 , the singularity at @xmath93 is stronger than the one at @xmath92 . *",
    "@xmath193 + the dynamics developed by both the sb and the sab maps is dominated by the intermittent behaviour near the marginally unstable fixed point at @xmath92 .",
    "the trajectories show an interplay of chaotic motion and laminar phases in the region of @xmath92 .",
    "the comparison of the maps belonging to the two classes shows nicely the detailed balance of the system generating the same invariant density : for a sab the exponent @xmath182 in the expansion @xmath194 , @xmath195 is much closer to @xmath138 than for the corresponding sb map and the region of the map where this expansion holds is larger .",
    "therefore the orbit tents to be captured for a longer time in this region . however , due to the diverging derivative of the sab map at @xmath93 , the laminar region is visited less often , which partially cancels the above effect .",
    "in this section we derive some dynamical and statistical properties of characteristic members of the sb and sab classes of maps .",
    "first we consider the lyapunov - exponents which are a measure for the degree of chaoticity . as the derivatives of both classes sb and sab",
    "are obtained from the frobenius - perron equation , the lyapunov - exponents @xmath196 and @xmath197 , respectively can be calculated using the definition @xmath198 .",
    "the implicit form of @xmath87 prevents an analytical treatment .",
    "therefore we have calculated @xmath196 and @xmath197 numerically for different values of @xmath199 , using the equations ( [ sbmap ] ) and ( [ sabmap ] ) , respectively .",
    "both lyapunov - exponents show similar features as functions of @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "most striking is the symmetry @xmath200 i.e. the lyapunov - exponent stays the same when switching from beta - maps to the complementary ones , given in eq.([betcom ] ) .",
    "this symmetry is even more astonishing , since it connects two very different kinds of dynamics with the same lyapunov - exponent , i.e. with the same degree of chaoticity .",
    "the value of the lyapunov exponent is maximal ( @xmath201 ) for the doubly symmetric case @xmath51 and decreases as @xmath202 increases .",
    "this can be at best seen in fig.3 where we show the lyapunov exponent @xmath203 as a function of the parameters @xmath83 .",
    "the decrease in the degree of chaoticity for the case @xmath180 is caused by the frequent occurrence of almost regular intermittent intervals while in the case @xmath204 it is caused by the dominating hopping of the orbit around the unstable fixed point of the map .",
    "let us now turn to the calculation of the autocorrelation function @xmath205 for the sb and sab members .",
    "again two types of maps in the sb and sab classes have to be distinguished :    * @xmath204 + the correlation function is oscillating with period @xmath206 and decays exponentially fast .",
    "this is a consequence of the oscillatory motion of the orbit about the unstable fixed point .",
    "the decay of the envelope is slower for maps with @xmath207 large , since the corresponding map has a more shallow slope of the right interval of monotony , which allows long lasting oscillations .",
    "the mean decay time of the sb maps ( see fig.4a ) is much shorter compared to those of the sab maps ( see fig.4b ) .",
    "this is caused by the fact that the symmetry of the map restricts the length of the highly correlated , oscillating phases of the orbit .",
    "* @xmath180 + the intermittent dynamics results in a correlation function , which decays algebraically in the long time regime according to @xmath208 . for weak intermittent dynamics",
    "the decay exponent @xmath209 can be estimated analytically .",
    "for this aim we use the map : @xmath210 assuming that the invariant density @xmath33 near the centre of intermittency is given by @xmath211 and following @xcite we derive the following scaling relation describing the autocorrelation function in the limit of distinctive intermittent behaviour , i.e. @xmath212 and for @xmath213 : @xmath214 with @xmath215 where @xmath216 is a constant characteristic for the system . this behaviour takes account of the long and highly correlated laminar sections of the orbit .",
    "the characteristic exponent @xmath209 decreases with increasing @xmath207 and thus corresponds to a slower decay of the correlation . for shorter times",
    "a transient behaviour leading into the algebraic decay can be seen .",
    "the correlation of systems generated by sb maps ( fig.5a ) decay faster compared to those sab maps with the same values for @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( fig.5b ) .",
    "the knowledge of the order of the sb maps in the maximum point and the zeros at @xmath92 and @xmath93 allows a comparison of the characteristic exponent @xmath217 obtained numerically with the value @xmath218 obtained by the continuous time approximation in @xcite .",

    "we have presented a general solution to the inverse frobenius - perron problem for the case of unimodal one - dimensional maps .",
    "this solution allows us to cover the entire space of fully chaotic unimodal maps with given invariant density .",
    "it is shown that the general solution can also be obtained by a suitably defined conjugation transformation .",
    "using this general representation one can find infinitely many particular solutions .",
    "to illustrate our method we applied it to obtain two classes of dynamical systems possessing the two parametric beta - probability function as the invariant density .",
    "we calculated the lyapunov exponents , autocorrelation functions and power spectra for these maps and studied the properties of the obtained solutions in a twofold manner : first we observed for given values of the parameters of the invariant density the changes in the dynamical and statistical properties for systems corresponding to different partial solutions of the frobenius - perron equation .",
    "we then varied the parameters of the invariant density remaining within a certain class of partial solutions . from our studies",
    "we conclude that two typical properties dominate the dynamics for unimodal beta maps .",
    "the first property is the hopping of the chaotic trajectory around the unstable fixed point of the map which leads to an exponential decay of correlations .",
    "the decay constant depends on the explicit form of the special solution for given parameters of the invariant density .",
    "the second possibility is the intermittent scenario : the chaotic trajectory possesses extented laminar phases in the neighbourhood of @xmath92 .",
    "the correlations in this case decay with a power - law .",
    "theoretical investigations predict that the characteristic exponent in this power - law decay is determined through the singularities of the invariant density at the center of intermittency ( @xmath92 ) as well as the derivative of the map at this point .",
    "we tested these estimations and found a satisfactory agreement with our numerical calculations .",
    "thus our approach to the inverse frobenius - perron problem allows us to determine one - dimensional maps with a rich variety of dynamical behaviour and enables us to perform accurate calculations for physical observables even in the case where the ergodic limit is computationally inaccessible ( intermittency ) .",
    "the obtained general solution involves the function @xmath1 and one might therefore use this degree of freedom to design dynamical laws with more prescribed quantities than the invariant density .",
    "one step in this direction would be to solve the inverse frobenius - perron problem with the additional constraint of a given autocorrelation function . using the parametrisation ( [ funx ] ) of the general solution to the frobenius - perron equation it should be in principle possible to design a map which is closest to a certain given correlation behaviour .",
