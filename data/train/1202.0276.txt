    "it is shown in @xcite that for @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 any constant , and with specified initial conditions , the solution to the non - homogeneous conolly recursion @xmath6 has a fascinating combinatorial interpretation .",
    "specifically , @xmath7 counts the number of _ labels _ that are less than or equal to @xmath8 in the leaves of a special labeled tree formed by  grafting \" infinitely many copies of a finite , rooted tree @xmath9 ( related to the parameter @xmath5 ) onto a labeled @xmath10-ary tree .",
    "the initial conditions for the recursion are specified by the finite tree @xmath9 and the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 .    any solution to ( [ recursion ] ) that can be characterized combinatorially in this way",
    "necessarily has the property that the difference @xmath13 between consecutive terms is either 0 or 1 .",
    "we call such a solution sequence _ slowly growing _ or , more briefly , _ slow _ ( see @xcite ) .    in general ,",
    "very little is known about the existence or behavior of non - slow solutions to ( [ recursion ] ) .",
    "the first example of such a solution appears in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that for @xmath14 the solution to the related homogeneous version of ( [ recursion ] ) with @xmath15 is non - slow for all odd @xmath16 , so long as the initial conditions are taken to be @xmath17 consecutive ones .",
    "when @xmath18 ; see @xcite , pp .",
    "822 - 824 . ]    to date all of the non - slow solutions to nested recursions of the form ( [ recursion ] ) have been derived by applying purely analytical ( as opposed to combinatorial ) techniques .",
    "further , no non - slow solutions are known to any recursions of this form that have @xmath19 .    in this paper",
    "we address both these deficiencies , thereby taking an initial step toward developing a combinatorial interpretation for non - slow solutions to non - homogeneous nested recursions .",
    "more precisely , we extend the tree - based solution methodology described in @xcite to derive a combinatorial interpretation for non - slow solutions to ( [ recursion ] ) in the case @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a fixed parameter , that is , the family of recursions @xmath23 with appropriately specified initial conditions .",
    "our focus on solving ( [ recur ] ) is motivated by several considerations .",
    "first , observe that for @xmath24 , @xmath18 and initial condition @xmath25 , ( [ recur ] ) is golomb s non - homogeneous nested triangular recursion @xcite .",
    "golomb was the first to investigate a non - homogeneous nested recursion of this type ; he showed that its solution is the slow sequence 1 , 2 , 2 , 3 , 3 , 3 , 4 , 4 , 4 , 4 , 5 , 5 , 5 , 5 , 5 ,  where every positive integer @xmath8 appears precisely @xmath8 times .",
    "that is , the frequency function @xmath26 of this sequence is given by @xmath27 .",
    "golomb further observed that this solution also has the neat closed form @xmath28 .",
    "second , one of us chanced upon the following natural related question : find a closed form for the general term in the sequence 1 , 3 , 3 , 3 , 5 , 5 , 5 , 5 , 5 ,  where each odd natural number @xmath29 appears @xmath29 times .",
    "this non - slow , monotone sequence appears in @xcite as entry a001650 , where it is noted that it is generated by the  golomb - like \" recursion coinciding with ( [ recur ] ) with @xmath30 , and @xmath31 and initial conditions 1 , 3 , 3 .",
    "from there we successively generalized the form of the nested recursion along the lines of ( [ recursion ] ) to yield ( [ recur ] ) , while simultaneously developing appropriate analogues for the initial conditions of interest ( more details are provided on these in section [ sec2 ] ) .    ; concurrently , as we soon show , we identified that the initial conditions of interest consist of @xmath32 1s followed by @xmath12 repetitions of the value @xmath33 .",
    "the natural generalization of golomb s recursion with @xmath24 but any @xmath3 and @xmath32 initial values all equal to 1 is discussed briefly in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there it is observed that the solution has a combinatorial interpretation in terms of counting leaves in a certain infinite unary tree , so is slow , and has frequency function @xmath34 .",
    "for instance , @xmath35 generates the sequence 1 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 3 , 3 , 3 , 3 , 3 , 4 , 4 , 4 , 4 , 4 , 4 ,  .",
    "based on our extensive experience with such recursions , it seemed natural to consider using a string of 1s of sufficient length to ensure that the recursion stayed defined ( see @xcite for various examples of nested recursions with such initial conditions providing interesting results ) .",
    "very quickly we identified    finally , recursion ( [ recur ] ) occurs naturally in the context of our analysis in @xcite for the case @xmath20 , where it follows immediately from the formula for @xmath5 ( see @xcite , p. 6 ) that with @xmath20 a tree - based slow solution can only exist if @xmath5 is a positive multiple of @xmath12 . here",
    "we solve this recursion with very different initial conditions from those in @xcite , in particular , they are not slow .",
    "the outline of the rest of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we show how to extend the tree - based solution methodology in @xcite to derive a non - slow solution to ( [ recur ] ) with specified initial conditions . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we illustrate how more than one such tree interpretation is possible , leading to different choices of the initial conditions and alternative solutions that are closely related . in the case",
    "@xmath1 the initial conditions for these alternative tree interpretations coincide , so we conclude in section [ sec4 ] by deriving explicit closed forms for the solution sequence and its frequency function in this case .",
    "in this section we give a combinatorial interpretation of the sequence generated by ( [ recur ] ) ; more precisely , we show how this sequence gives a weighted count of the leaves of the labeled infinite tree @xmath36 which we construct now .",
    "fix integers @xmath37 and @xmath3 , which will correspond to the desired parameters of the recursion . for ease of reference , in what follows we write @xmath38 in place of @xmath39 where there is no confusion .",
    "our approach closely resembles that of @xcite .",
    "there are two key steps in our construction .",
    "first we construct the nodes and edges that form the skeleton of @xmath36 .",
    "then we insert the consecutive positive integers that are the labels in the nodes of @xmath36 . to do this ,",
    "first we must specify the order in which the nodes of @xmath36 are to be traversed one at a time ; then we insert the appropriate number of labels ( either @xmath40 or @xmath41 ) in each node . to help describe this construction ,",
    "we illustrate our discussion for the case @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the skeleton of @xmath36 consists of an infinite sequence @xmath45 of rooted , finite subtrees of @xmath36 that we connect together to form @xmath36 .",
    "we define @xmath46 to be a chain consisting of two nodes connected by a single edge ; we call this a chain of length @xmath47 .",
    "we take one of the nodes to be the root of @xmath46 while the other node at the end of the chain is a leaf .",
    "we form subtree @xmath48 as follows : take a copy of @xmath46 and attach exactly @xmath49 chains with @xmath12 nodes (  length @xmath12 \" ) to the leaf node . note",
    "that @xmath48 has @xmath49 leaves .",
    "for @xmath50 we construct the subtree @xmath51 in an analogous way : take a copy of @xmath52 and attach a chain of length @xmath12 to each of its @xmath49 leaves . for each @xmath53",
    ", we refer to the root of @xmath51 as the @xmath54 * supernode * of @xmath36 .",
    "the single node connected to the @xmath54 supernode is called @xmath54 * knot node * , while all other nodes of @xmath51 are * regular nodes*. note that in every @xmath55 the regular nodes at the end of each of the @xmath49 chains are leaves .    next , for all",
    "@xmath56 we connect the subtree @xmath51 to @xmath57 by adding an edge from the @xmath54 supernode to the @xmath58 . to complete the construction of @xmath36 we attach an extra regular node as a child of the first supernode in @xmath46 .",
    "we call this additional regular node the * initial leaf of @xmath36*. see figure [ fig1 ] for the construction of @xmath36 for the case @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 ; note that supernodes are marked by rectangles .    ]",
    "we insert one label into each regular node of @xmath36 and @xmath41 labels into each supernode .",
    "the labels consist of successive integers starting at 1 .",
    "before we can insert these labels we must specify the traversal order of the nodes in @xmath36 .",
    "we recursively define a * pre - order * traversal as follows : @xmath46 is traversed by beginning at the initial leaf followed by the supernode itself and then to the remaining leaf .",
    "having traversed @xmath51 for @xmath56 , the subtree @xmath57 is traversed next by starting at the @xmath58 supernode , then continuing to the knot node immediately below it , and then traversing the length of each of the @xmath49 chains from left to right .",
    "see figure [ fig2 ] for the labeling in case @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "]    let @xmath59 be the subtree of @xmath36 consisting of all the nodes of @xmath36 with label(s ) less than or equal to @xmath8 .",

    "for compactness we write @xmath63 . if @xmath61 is not all of @xmath62",
    "then it has fewer than @xmath49 chains attached to its knot node and/or one of these chains has fewer than @xmath64 nodes ; in this case we call the subtree @xmath61 * incomplete*.    we assign a weight of @xmath40 to the initial leaf of @xmath36 while the rest of the leaves receive the weight @xmath12 . define the * leaf weight sequence * @xmath65 whose @xmath66 member equals the sum of the weights of the leaves of @xmath36 that are in @xmath59 . in other words , @xmath65 is the total weight of the leaves of @xmath36 with label less than or equal to @xmath8 ; in figure [ fig2 ] @xmath67 begins 1,1,1,1,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,5,5,7,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,11 ,  .",
    "the leaf weight sequence of @xmath36 is just the sequence 1,3,3,3,5,5,5,5,5 ,  discussed in section [ sec1 ] . ] where there is no confusion we write @xmath68 .",
    "one needs to be careful to distinguish leaves of @xmath36 from leaves of @xmath59 . in particular ,",
    "not all leaves of @xmath59 are leaves of @xmath36 . for example , in figure [ fig2 ] , the node containing the label 52 is a leaf of @xmath69 but not of @xmath36 .",
    "now we are ready to state our main result on the combinatorial interpretation of the integer sequence generated by @xmath38 .",

    "[ thm : count ]    the key to proving theorem [ thm : count ] lies with the pruning operation @xmath74 on @xmath75 , @xmath48 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath61 which yields a new tree @xmath78 defined as follows : first disconnect the initial leaf from @xmath46 and remove the rest of @xmath46 ( together with its labels ) from the tree .",
    "next , for @xmath79 , delete the @xmath12 largest labels along with the nodes that contain them from each chain connected to @xmath54 knot node in @xmath51 . from the construction of @xmath36 it follows that doing so turns each @xmath51 into @xmath52 , @xmath79 .",
    "now we turn our attention to @xmath61 .",
    "there are three cases : ( 1 ) if @xmath61 has at least @xmath47 chains connected to its knot node , then delete the @xmath12 largest labels and the nodes that contain these labels from each chain with at least @xmath12 labels ; ( 2 ) if @xmath61 has fewer than 2 chains but has at least @xmath12 labels in total , then delete the largest @xmath12 labels and all the nodes that become unlabeled as a result ; ( 3 ) finally , if @xmath61 has fewer than @xmath12 labels , then do nt do anything . in all cases , note that the pruning operation turns @xmath61 into @xmath80 , some portion of @xmath77 .    finally , we reconnect the initial leaf to the supernode of the subtree that started initially ( before any pruning took place ) as @xmath48 and relabel the resulting tree in pre - order as defined above .",

    "[ lemma : prun ]    fix @xmath86 .",
    "let @xmath89 .",
    "since @xmath90 and @xmath91 is the total number of labels contained in @xmath46 and @xmath48 , it follows that @xmath92 .    as we noted above",
    ", it must be the case that after relabeling @xmath82 for some @xmath83 .",
    "it suffices to show that @xmath93 , that is , we need to show that the total number of labels removed from the tree during the pruning operation is @xmath94 . by deleting the supernode of @xmath46 we removed @xmath41 labels .",
    "thus we must show that the number of labels removed from @xmath95 plus the one label removed by deleting the leaf of @xmath46 together sum up to @xmath96 .",
    "note that since @xmath77 is complete it has @xmath49 chains of length @xmath97 attached to its knot node .",
    "denote the chain with the largest label in @xmath77 by @xmath98 .",
    "suppose @xmath61 contains the @xmath99 knot node and there are at least 2 chains connected to it .",
    "denote these chains in @xmath61 by @xmath100 where @xmath101 .",
    "otherwise , as we discussed above , we consider @xmath61 itself as a chain , which we call @xmath102 . in either case , we know that the node with label @xmath8 lies in the chain @xmath103 where @xmath104 .",
    "we consider two cases .",
    "case 1 : assume that @xmath103 contains @xmath105 labels . consider the node with label @xmath106 in @xmath59 . since @xmath103 has less than @xmath12 labels and the chain @xmath107 has at least @xmath12 labels we know that the node with label @xmath108 lies in @xmath107 .",
    "moreover , it is not a leaf node of @xmath36 since a leaf node in this chain has the label @xmath109 .",
    "each chain in subtree @xmath51 where @xmath110 ( except the last chain in @xmath77 ) contributes @xmath12 to @xmath96 which accounts for @xmath12 labels removed from it during pruning .",

    "the single leaf of @xmath46 also contributes @xmath12 to @xmath96 which accounts for @xmath12 labels removed when pruning @xmath107 . finally , the weight of initial leaf in @xmath96 accounts for the single label removed from the leaf of @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , @xmath93 and @xmath78 is same as @xmath113 .",
    "case 2 : assume that @xmath103 contains @xmath114 labels .",
    "again we consider the node with label @xmath108 . in this case , this node is either the leaf of @xmath107 or a node ( but not the leaf ) of @xmath103 .",
    "however , in both cases , @xmath96 counts the weights of the same leaves . as before each chain in subtree @xmath51 where @xmath110 ( except the last chain in @xmath77 ) contributes @xmath12 to @xmath96 which accounts for @xmath12 labels removed from it during pruning .",
    "each of the chains @xmath111 with @xmath115 contributes @xmath12 to @xmath96 which accounts for @xmath12 labels removed from it . in this case , we have also removed @xmath12 labels from @xmath103 while pruning @xmath59 and the weight of the single leaf of @xmath46 contributes @xmath12 to @xmath96 to account for this . finally , the weight of initial leaf in @xmath96 accounts for the single label removed from the leaf of @xmath46 and we have that @xmath93 .",
    "the weight of the leaves of @xmath36 in @xmath78 differs by @xmath116 from the weight of the leaves of @xmath36 in @xmath59 since we have removed the leaf of @xmath46 and @xmath117 leaves of @xmath48 .",
    "this together with the fact that @xmath87 imply that @xmath88 .",
    "this completes the proof of the lemma .",
    "theorem [ thm : count ] now follows from lemma [ lemma : prun ] by induction .",
    "armed with this lemma , we now prove theorem ( [ thm : count ] ) .",
    "we prove this theorem by induction on @xmath8 .",
    "first note that @xmath118 since the only leaf with label less than @xmath32 is initial node .",
    "also @xmath119 since now we count both initial node and the leaf of @xmath120 with weight @xmath12 . therefore , from initial conditions @xmath121 for @xmath122 .",
    "now we let @xmath123 and we assume that for all @xmath124 we have @xmath125 .",
    "note that @xmath126 and by previous lemma @xmath127 as required .",
    "in the preceding section we showed how to solve the recursion ( [ recur ] ) in the case where the initial conditions are derived from the tree @xmath36 and the leaf weighting scheme described there .",
    "it turns out that other trees and weighting schemes lead to a solution of ( [ recur ] ) but with different initial conditions that depend upon the tree .",
    "for example , consider the initial portion of the tree @xmath128 in figure [ fig4 ] .    ]",
    "it is readily seen that @xmath128 is another tree that corresponds to ( [ recur ] ) with @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "note that there is no knot node in @xmath128 , but rather a ",
    "tail \" node in each of the sub - trees that make it up ( in figure [ fig4 ] these are the nodes 17 , 34 and 57 ) . here",
    "the leaf weight sequence begins 1,1,1,1,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,5,5,7,7,7,9  .",
    "it is readily seen that this sequence , like the one related to figure [ fig2 ] , consists of all the odd positive integers in order , but the frequencies with which these integers occur are different between the two sequences .",
    "other tree constructions are also possible",
    ".    we can use the obvious generalization of the tree @xmath128 for arbitrary parameters @xmath129 and @xmath41 , together with the same approach discussed in section [ sec2 ] , to demonstrate the analogue of theorem [ thm : count ] holds : if @xmath130 for all @xmath131 , then @xmath132 for all @xmath8 , where @xmath133 is the leaf weight sequence for the tree @xmath128 .",
    "for the same choice of the parameters it is not hard to show , as we saw in the example above , that the members of the leaf weight sequences related to @xmath36 and @xmath128 respectively are the same , although in general they appear with different frequencies . in the special case",
    "@xmath1 the trees @xmath36 and @xmath128 are the same , so the initial conditions and thus the leaf weight sequences generated by recursion ( [ recur ] ) must match .",
    "in the next section we derive formulas related to the leaf weight sequence in this case .    on figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "this construction and proofs similar to the ones given in section [ sec2 ] hold in general and we obtain alternative combinatorial interpretation of the recursion ( [ recur ] ) .    it is possible use recursion [ recur ] to generate sequences that also have completely different members .",
    "for instance , @xmath38 with @xmath42,@xmath43 and @xmath44 and initial conditions @xmath134 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 generates a sequence @xmath137 .",
    "not only this sequence contains even numbers ( unlike all the other examples we have seen so far for this parameter set ) , but it is also non monotone .",
    "for arbitrary @xmath138 and @xmath1 , the tree @xmath36 of section [ sec2 ] can be described as follows : it consists of an infinite sequence of sub - trees @xmath45 , where for @xmath139 each @xmath51 is a chain of length @xmath140 with root at the @xmath54 supernode and with @xmath141 labels .",
    "we refer to the initial leaf of @xmath36 as zeroth leaf .",
    "we call the only other leaf in @xmath46 the first leaf of @xmath36 , while for @xmath139 the single leaf of @xmath51 is the @xmath58 leaf of @xmath36 . in this section",
    "we derive closed forms for the leaf weight sequence sequence and its frequency function that generalize the results in @xcite for the sequence @xmath142 .",
    "we begin with the frequency function .",
    "the recursion ( [ recur ] ) with parameters @xmath143 and initial conditions as in theorem [ thm : count ] generates a sequence @xmath144 with frequency function @xmath145 [ thm : freq ]    by theorem [ thm : count ] @xmath73 , so it is enough to prove this statement for @xmath70 .",
    "let @xmath85 be the label of the @xmath99 leaf in @xmath36 . if @xmath146 then @xmath147 and thus @xmath148 .",
    "if @xmath149 , then @xmath150 is the sum of the weights of the leaves of @xmath36 in @xmath151 .",
    "since each of these chains has a single leaf of weight @xmath12 and @xmath46 also has an initial leaf with weight @xmath40 , we have @xmath152 .",
    "if @xmath153 is the label of the @xmath154 leaf , then @xmath155 for @xmath156 . by the construction of @xmath36 there are exactly @xmath157 labels @xmath8 such that @xmath158 ( one leaf label @xmath85 and @xmath159 labels in @xmath62 ) .",
    "therefore , if @xmath160 then @xmath161 is repeated at least @xmath162 times in the sequence @xmath70 . but the sequence @xmath70 is non - decreasing and @xmath163 ( if @xmath164 ) and @xmath165 .",
    "thus we conclude that if @xmath160 then @xmath161 is repeated exactly @xmath162 times .",

    "first we show that it holds when @xmath8 is a leaf label .",
    "then we extend this formula to apply to all other natural numbers @xmath8 .",
    "when @xmath180 it is the label of the @xmath181 leaf .",
    "but then @xmath182 so the right hand side of the formula in the statement of the theorem simplifies to @xmath40 as required .",
    "next assume that @xmath8 is the label of the @xmath154 leaf in @xmath36 , so is the leaf label of subtree @xmath62 .",
    "each of @xmath183 contain @xmath141 , @xmath184 labels , while there is one extra label in the initial leaf .",
    "this implies that @xmath154 leaf has label @xmath185 .",
    "but from the proof of theorem [ thm : freq ] we have that @xmath186 if @xmath8 is the label of the @xmath187 leaf in @xmath36 .",
    "we combine these two observations to derive a closed formula for @xmath38 for such @xmath8 .    expanding the sum for @xmath8 we get @xmath188 . multiplying both sides by @xmath12 and rewriting the result suggestively yields @xmath189 , which is just @xmath190 .",
    "therefore , we have the quadratic equation @xmath191 , which we solve for @xmath38 in terms of @xmath8 . to do so we need the discriminant of the quadratic @xmath192 . but this inequality holds for @xmath193 since all the parameters are non - negative integers .",
    "the positive root of the quadratic equation is    @xmath194    which satisfies conclusion of the theorem since @xmath195 in this case .",

    "but as we observed at the outset , this leaf node has label @xmath179 , so @xmath202 . but",
    "@xmath203 , which completes the proof .",
    "we conclude by deriving a simple closed form solution for the recursion @xmath204 .",
