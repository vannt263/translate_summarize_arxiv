    "there exist several evidences that indicate the most fraction of matter in the universe is consisted of unknown particles called as dark matter ( dm ) @xcite .",
    "namely , the observations by wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) for the study of fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation show that the universe consists of @xmath4 matter and the rest @xmath5 is an unknown energy called dark energy @xcite .",
    "baryonic matter composes only less than @xmath6 of the matter content of the universe and the others remain unknown .",
    "the most important constraints and properties which need to be obeyed by dm candidates have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the evidences offer that the dm candidates are mostly stable , non - baryonic , massive , non relativistic and have insignificant or very weak interactions with other particles .",
    "these types of dm are often called as cold dm ( cdm ) or weakly interacting massive particles ( wimp ) .",
    "since the particles accommodated in the standard model ( sm ) can not play the dm role , it is one of the most important motivations for the extension of the sm .",
    "for instance supersymmetric models with r parity @xcite , the extra dimensional models with conserved kaluza - klein ( kk ) parity @xcite , the t - parity conserved little higgs model @xcite and so on , provide wimp dm candidates .",
    "although all sectors of the sm have passed every experimental test , there does not exist any experimental confirmation for all its extensions .",
    "therefore , some authors extend , minimally , the sm to explain anomalous problems such as dm .",
    "for instance , it is possible to have a cdm candidate if the sm is extended by a gauge singlet scalar particle @xcite .",
    "also , a gauge singlet fermion as a cdm is investigated by @xcite , and in @xcite authors defined a scenario where a singlet right - handed neutrino is added together with a charged and a neutral singlet scalars .",
    "in particular , one can achieve a renormalizable theory for dm if the sm is extended by a singlet fermion as cdm ( sfcmd ) and a singlet scalar higgs as a mediator @xcite .",
    "that is , in this theory , sfcdm interacts with sm particles through its coupling to singlet higgs .",
    "the mixing between the sm higgs and the singlet higgs leads to the coupling of both higgses with sfcdm .",
    "the relic abundance constraint and direct detection bounds have been studied for the sfcdm masses below 100 gev in @xcite and it has been shown that all relic abundance and lep2 allowed regions are excluded by direct detection bounds except at resonance . the sfcdm annihilation into two photons under relic abundance constraint has been obtained and compared with fermi - lat bounds for masses below 200 gev in @xcite . moreover , in ref .",
    "@xcite authors show that sfcdm can be such a dark matter candidate , simultaneously providing the correct thermal relic density which is consistent with relic abundance .",
    "also in ref .",
    "@xcite sfcdm has been studied to see if it can explain the recent lhc data while fulfilling other observational and cosmological requirements .",
    "recently , an updated analysis of sfcdm model has been done for masses up to 1 tev with focusing on its direct detection prospects @xcite .",
    "this analysis is based on a sample of about @xmath7 random models satisfying the usual theoretical and experimental constraints , including the dark matter bounds .",
    "also , the electroweak phase transition has been studied for sfcdm model in @xcite . in this paper , we give an investigation of the parameter space of sfcdm model for masses up to 1 tev , independently . although , an annihilation cross section of sfcdm into the sm particles and two singlet higgs bosons ( with some missprints ) reported in @xcite , we have obtained the total cross section ( including three higgs bosons in final state ) . in particular , we study the role of every parameter which provides a viable framework for more accurate analysis in future .",
    "as we shall see , for instance , the mixing parameter between the sm higgs and singlet higgs is a relevant parameter and constraining it leads to significant bounds on the parameter space .",
    "we consider the relic abundance constrain to analyze parameter space .",
    "it is noticeable that we use perturbation theory , so that those values of the coupling constants which are larger than one are unreasonable in this framework .",
    "this means that , respecting the relic density constraint we only consider points in parameter space which lead to applicable coupling constant in perturbation theory , and we do not have any judgment on the other points . in the other words , if we decide to use of perturbation theory , we naturally have to work with a set of parameters which satisfy the perturbation condition ; at such a regime we compare our results with experimental data and the possible exclusion points are actually physical .",
    "we also study the possibility of the direct detection of sfcdm by comparing the theoretical results , for those coupling constants consistent with our perturbation theory , with the recent experimental results such as xenon100 @xcite , lux @xcite , coupp @xcite and picasso @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we briefly review the extended sm by a gauge singlet fermion and a gauge singlet scalar called singlet higgs . in section [ sec3 ] , the sensitivity of the annihilation cross section of sfcdm to every free parameter under relic abundance constraint is studied . in section [ s3 ] ,",
    "we obtain the cross section of the scattering of sfcdm off nucleons for two chosen sets of parameters consistent with perturbation theory , then we compare our results with the recently reported data by xenon100 , lux , coupp and picasso collaborations . finally , we give a summary and discussion in the last section .",
    "the most minimal extension of the sm accommodating a cdm candidate is achieved by adding gauge singlet particles . in the case of scalar",
    ", one needs only a gauge singlet scalar field with zero vacuum expectation value to have a renormalizable theory for dm @xcite .",
    "otherwise , singlet fermion can also play the dark matter role ( sfcdm ) provided that it has a very weak interaction with the sm particles @xcite . to accommodate this by a renormalizable manner ,",
    "a singlet higgs , in addition to the usual higgs doublet , is needed as mediator between sfcdm and the sm particles @xcite .",
    "therefore , the lagrangian of sfcdm model can be decomposed as follows : @xmath8    where @xmath9 indicates the usual sm lagrangian .",
    "@xmath10 is the hidden sector lagrangian @xmath11 in which apart form the last term , the interaction between the sfcdm and singlet higgs with coupling constant @xmath0 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the free lagrangians of sfcdm @xmath14 and singlet higgs @xmath15 respectively .",
    "the last term of eq.([sfcdm ] ) , @xmath16 , is related to the interaction between the singlet higgs and the sm doublet higgs @xmath17 here , the coupling constants @xmath18and@xmath19 have one and zero mass dimension , respectively .",
    "the scalar potentials given by eqs .",
    "( [ selfs ] ) and ( [ hs ] ) along with the scalar potential of higgs doublet , @xmath20 , are minimized by @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are , respectively , the sm higgs and singlet higgs values which minimize the classical total potential .",
    "hence , they have to satisfy the following relations : @xmath25 we define the fields @xmath26 and @xmath27 as departure from the vacuum expectation values corresponding to the sm and the singlet higgs , respectively .",
    "therefore , after symmetry breaking @xmath28 and @xmath29 are replaced by @xmath30 and @xmath31 the mass matrix elements are given by @xmath32 diagonalizing the mass matrix we obtain the mass eigenstates as follows : @xmath33 where the mixing angle @xmath3 is defined by @xmath34 with @xmath35 .",
    "the mass eigenvalues are @xmath36 from the definition of the mixing angle ( [ mixing ] ) , we have @xmath37 . therefore , @xmath38 is the sm higgs - like scalar while @xmath39 is the singlet - like one .",
    "the singlet fermion has mass @xmath40 which is an independent parameter in the model .",
    "in the wimp scenario , a dm particle can be produced thermally through a ` freeze - out ' mechanism .",
    "in fact , when the interaction rate of a particle species in the early universe drops below the expansion rate of the universe , it falls out of the equilibrium and its number density in the comoving volume remains constant .",
    "this production mechanisms arises from @xmath41 pair annihilation into the sm fermions , the gauge bosons and the higgs boson .",
    "the evolution of the density number of a singlet fermion , @xmath42 , is given by the following boltzmann equation : @xmath43,\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the thermally averaged annihilation cross section times the relative velocity , and @xmath45 indicates the equilibrium density number of @xmath46 . as we said above ,",
    "when the the expansion rate of the universe exceeds the interaction rate of a dm , our particle species falls out of thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "hence , the relic density , defined as the ratio of the present density to the critical density , @xmath47 , is written roughly as follows : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the effective degrees of freedom for the relativistic quantities in equilibrium @xcite .",
    "the inverse freeze - out temperature @xmath50 is determined by the following iterative equation : @xmath51 we can obtain @xmath52 from @xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 are the modified bessel functions . in the appendix",
    ", we obtain @xmath55 applicable for throughout mass range of singlet fermion .",
    "note that , as the mass of dm increases new channels for annihilation to the higgs bosons are opened in addition to the sm channels .",
    "we have listed the relevant feynman diagrams in fig .",
    "these diagrams are at tree level , so we should respect the perturbation in our calculations .     (",
    "@xmath56 ) , is symmetric under permutations of their subscripts . for three higgs bosons in final state",

    ", width=472 ]    now , we study the allowed parameter space consistent with the relic abundance constraint obtained by wmap observations @xcite .",
    "in addition to the sm parameters , here we have seven independent ones : singlet fermion mass @xmath1 , a coupling constant between singlet fermion and singlet higgs @xmath62 , the mass of the singlet higgs @xmath63 and its self - interaction couplings @xmath64 and @xmath65 , and the coupling constants between singlet higgs and sm one @xmath66 and @xmath59 .",
    "we encounter a new set of parameters after spontaneous symmetry breaking : @xmath1 , @xmath62 , second higgs mass @xmath2 , @xmath66 , @xmath59 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and mixing angel between higgs bosons @xmath3 which is not an independent parameter .",

    "[ fig1 ] ) , corresponding to the two higgs bosons in final state ( ignoring the processes with three higgs bosons in final state due to the kinematically suppression ) , come from @xmath69 and two last terms of @xmath70 , after symmetry breaking . therefore , all @xmath71 s contribute in cross section almost equally ( specially around the maximal mixing ) .",
    "this point also can be checked from the cross section obtained in appendix .",
    "it depends on @xmath66 , @xmath59 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 via @xmath68 s and @xmath72 s ( defined in eq .",

    "one can similarly check that the variation of @xmath66 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 have no significant effect too .",

    "<S> we consider the standard model ( sm ) extended by a gauge singlet fermion as cold dark matter ( sfcdm ) and a gauge singlet scalar ( singlet higgs ) as a mediator . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter space of the sm is enlarged by seven new ones . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the total annihilation cross section of singlet fermions to the sm particles and singlet higgs at tree level . regarding the relic abundance constraint obtained by wmap observations </S>",
    "<S> , we study the dependency on each parameter separately , for dark matter masses up to 1 tev . in particular , the coupling of sfcdm to singlet higgs @xmath0 , the sfcdm mass @xmath1 , the second higgs mass @xmath2 , and the higgs bosons mixing angel @xmath3 are investigated accurately . </S>",
    "<S> three other parameters play no significant role . for a maximal mixing of higgs bosons or at resonances , @xmath0 is applicable for the perturbation theory at tree level . </S>",
    "<S> we also obtain the scattering cross section of sfcdm off nucleons and compare our results with experiments which have already reported data in this mass range ; xenon100 , lux , coupp and picasso collaborations . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the sfcdm is excluded by these experiments for choosing parameters which are consistent with perturbation theory and relic abundance constraints . </S>"
