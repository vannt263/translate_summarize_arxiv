    "frames @xcite are crucial mathematical objects used for the study of overcomplete bases and subsequent applications .",
    "although they were introduced in the mathematical literature from some time , they have been introduced relatively recently to the signal processing community where their capability to represent signals in overcomplete bases is exploited .",
    "the properties of some classes of frames make them well suited in the area of sparse representations @xcite and compressive sensing @xcite . for the sparse recovery algorithms , like basis pursuit ( bp ) @xcite and matching pursuit ( omp ) @xcite ,",
    "a theoretical framework has been developed where the performance of these algorithms can be studied using concepts like the mutual coherence @xcite and the restricted isometry property ( rip ) @xcite .",
    "the mutual coherence of a matrix is defined as the maximum absolute value of the normalized dot products between different columns and it is thus very easy to compute , while the rip characterizes how close a matrix is to an orthogonal one when operating on sparse vectors .",
    "the guarantees for successful recovery of the sparsest solutions to overcomplete systems of equations depend directly on these properties , i.e. , frames with low mutual coherence are highly desirable . in terms of the mutual coherence",
    "the main research direction is to find structures as incoherent as possible ( like equiangular tight frames @xcite@xcite , while for the rip classes of matrices that meet desirable bounds have been found ( we mention random gaussian and bernoulli matrices ) and used with great success in compressive sensing .",
    "furthermore , even though highly incoherent frames have not been extensively used in signal processing they are of great importance in coding theory and communications @xcite for the construction of erasure - robust codes @xcite and for the development of spherical codes @xcite @xcite .",
    "strong connections have been shown to exist between grassmannian packings , graph theory and spherical codes @xcite .",
    "applications have also seen frames used in quantum computing @xcite .",
    "thus , the construction of highly incoherent frames is of central importance .",
    "this paper is concerned with the design of real frames as incoherent as possible in an @xmath0 dimensional hilbert space with @xmath1 vectors .",
    "we propose an algorithm based on convex optimization called sequential iterative decorrelation by convex optimization ( sidco ) .",
    "we provide insights into the way it behaves , we are able to give conditions under which the algorithm converges , what classes of frames are its minimum and we show experimentally that it substantially outperforms all other methods in the literature .",
    "sidco is a major improvement of a previously introduced method for incoherent frame design based on convex optimization @xcite . with the approach of sidco , the problem lends itself to detailed analysis allowing for the selection of the optimal internal parameters , which in @xcite are chosen heuristically , while the solutions achieve lower coherence in shorter running times .",
    "the application to optimized compressed sensing @xcite shows that sidco outperforms all previous methods .",
    "in the case of frame design , probably the most influential work consists of a design procedure based on the alternating projection method @xcite with an implementation presented in @xcite .",
    "these methods concentrate on the gram matrix of the real frame @xmath2 since we need to minimize its largest off - diagonal absolute value entry .",
    "the procedures can be summarized by the following iterative procedure : construct the gram matrix @xmath3 of the current dictionary , decrease the values of a fixed number of entries in @xmath3 by a given amount , use the singular value decomposition ( svd ) to reduce the rank of @xmath3 to @xmath0 and then factor out the new dictionary .",
    "besides the need to run for a large number of iterations , this class of methods proves to work well in practice , especially for small sized dictionaries . still , there are some internal parameters that need to be tuned : the number of entries of the gram matrix to be updated and how big this update is .",
    "previous to this family of methods , in the field of communications , algorithms were developed to construct tight frames , that are the optimal sequences for ds - cdma systems , by minimizing the total squared correlation ( tsc ) @xcite .",
    "related work on minimizing tsc for binary sequences is also found in @xcite@xcite .",
    "other methods , like the one in @xcite approach a unit norm tight frame by solving a differential equation , while the work in @xcite uses a gradient based method to decrease the coherence of the frame",
    ".    considerable effort was allocated to the creation of explicit ( and sometimes equiangular ) frames using constructions by conference matrices @xcite , kerdock codes @xcite , strongly regular graphs @xcite , steiner systems @xcite or adjacency matrices of paley tournaments @xcite .",
    "although in this paper we study real valued frames , extensive work studies complex @xcite and complex harmonic @xcite frames .",
    "for example , in the quantum information theory literature we can find constructions of symmetric , informationally complete , positive operator valued measures ( sic - povm ) @xcite that achieve low coherence for @xmath4 vectors in complex hilbert spaces .",
    "these frames have been constructed , by numerical methods , for all dimensions @xmath5 @xcite and it is conjectured that they exist for all @xmath0 .",
    "recently , a method based on averaged projections @xcite has been proposed where the authors improve the shrinkage operation proposed from @xcite to produce less coherent frames .",
    "this method is the state of the art in incoherent frame design .",
    "the method that we analyze , and improve upon here , was the first to treat the problem directly on the frame , and not on its gram matrix .",
    "the method @xcite solves the original non - convex problem of designing incoherent frames by considering a series of convex problems such that each reduces the coherence of the previous frame .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : frames ] outlines properties of frames , introduces the optimization problem central to our proposed method and its properties , section [ sec : proposedmethod ] presents the proposed method for incoherent frame design , section [ sec : results ] gives extensive experimental results for the proposed method , with comparisons , and section [ sec : conclusions ] concludes the paper .",
    "in this section we present and analyze the convex optimization problem at the heart of the incoherent frame design method that follows this section .",
    "we call a finite frame over the field @xmath6 a sequence of @xmath1 vectors @xmath7 that satisfies @xmath8 and we introduce the frame synthesis matrix @xmath2 consisting of the concatenated vectors of the frame @xmath9 constants @xmath10 , @xmath11 , with @xmath12 , are called the lower and upper bounds of the frame . when @xmath13 the frame is called @xmath10-tight and when @xmath14 the frame is called a parseval frame . in this paper",
    ", we consider all vectors in the frame to have unit @xmath15 norm ( i. e. placed on the unit @xmath0-sphere ) , which means that the dot products are equal to the cosine of the acute angle between each two vectors . these are called unit norm frames and they are the focus of this paper .",
    "we recall the gram matrix of the full rank frame @xmath16 to be @xmath17 .",
    "this matrix is symmetric and positive semidefinite with rank @xmath0 , it has a unit diagonal ( because of the normalized vectors of the frame ) and the off - diagonal entries are equal to the dot products between any two distinct vectors . based on this matrix we define the mutual coherence as @xmath18    from its definition it is clear that the mutual coherence @xmath19 takes values between 0 and 1 , with the lower bound reached for orthonormal frames and the upper bound reached when two vectors of the frame are collinear .",
    "we define frames that have a low mutual coherence value to be incoherent .",
    "the mutual coherence is useful , for example , in the context of sparse representations since it provides a bound on the performance of sparse approximation algorithms @xcite : considering the system @xmath20 , with @xmath16 full rank @xmath0 , the solution @xmath21 of bp or omp is the sparsest if @xmath22    the frame potential @xcite @xmath23 was introduced to describe how close the frame @xmath16 is to a unitary tight frame , when fp achieves its minimum of @xmath24 .",
    "since the properties of interest of these frames revolve around the gram matrix , most design procedures consider the @xmath3 matrix the central object while their constructions are based on the following theorem presented in @xcite and the numerical procedure of polar decomposition to recover the frame .",
    "* theorem 2 of @xcite .",
    "* let @xmath16 be a @xmath25 matrix with singular value decomposition @xmath26 .",
    "with respect to the frobenius norm , the closest @xmath10-tight frame to @xmath16 is given by @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28    we next define the equiangular tight frames ( etfs ) @xcite as the sequence of @xmath1 vectors @xmath29 that obey : @xmath30 @xmath31 with an immediate consequence of and that the distances between all the different member vectors are the same and equal , in absolute value , to @xmath32 this relation describes in fact a general lower bound on the mutual coherence that is also known as the welch bound ( wb ) or ranking bound @xcite which we use as a reference point performance , for perspective .",
    "this is the optimal bound of coherence for @xmath33 , the regime that we consider here .",
    "the ratio @xmath34 defines the redundancy of the frame and we call frames @xmath35 to be @xmath36overcomplete",
    ".    it is trivial to observe that orthonormal frames are etfs and actually reach the lowest possible coherence , zero .",
    "sadly , we are interested in highly overcomplete frames , i.e. , @xmath37 , where etfs only exist for a few pairs @xmath38 ( for example , for the real case , these do not exist if @xmath39 @xcite ) .",
    "when they exist , etfs provide the lowest possible mutual coherence and they are considered the generalization of orthonormal bases because they preserve ( a generalization of ) parseval s identity .",
    "a generalization of etfs is embodied by grassmannian frames ( gfs ) . for these structures ,",
    "the largest absolute value dot product is minimum for the given dimensions @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "notice that this relaxed condition means that gfs exist for every pair @xmath38 .",
    "still , this does not help in decreasing the computational complexity of finding them or even deciding if a given frame is a gf .    from this brief outline",
    "it should be clear that creating maximally incoherent frames ( either etf or grassmanian ) is an extremely difficult task in the general case and there are no guarantees that the lower bound of coherence can be reached for a given pair @xmath38 .",
    "necessary conditions for the existence of etfs are given in @xcite .",
    "this subsection is dedicated to the description of a numerical procedure for the design of incoherent frames .",
    "we develop an optimization procedure that directly designs the frame @xmath16 .",
    "ideally , we would like to solve exactly the following non - convex optimization problem : @xmath40 solving this problem exactly would produce etfs , when they exist , or grassmanian frames otherwise .",
    "the difficulty lies in the fact that both the objective and the equality constraints are non - convex .",
    "we proceed to relax this problem and provide convex optimization formulations to solve it approximately .",
    "the approach taken in this paper is not to solve directly but given a frame @xmath41 to find a new frame @xmath42 that is near ( in a sense that is made exact ) to the initial one , with smaller mutual coherence .    for all @xmath43",
    "the optimization problem we study is @xmath44 for clarity , we can also define @xmath45 and thus the objective function of becomes @xmath46 . solving this problem ,",
    "we define for each vector @xmath47 in the reference frame a trust region ( a closed @xmath0-ball centered at @xmath47 of radius @xmath48 ) where we search for a new vector @xmath49 such that its correlation ( in absolute value ) with the other vectors in the frame @xmath50 is smaller than that of @xmath47 .",
    "the only input parameter of the optimization procedure @xmath51 is a measure of how far we are willing to leave the reference frame @xmath52 in the search for the new frame @xmath16 .",
    "since now we are dealing with a convex objective function and constraint , the formulation in can be viewed as the convex relaxation of .",
    "observe that each vector of the frame can be computed separately in . given a fixed frame @xmath52",
    "assume that @xmath49 is the only optimization variable and , without loss of generality , that @xmath53 ( when not , flip the sign of @xmath54 ) .",
    "we stress this form of the frame since this imposed structure reduces the size of the convex optimization problems that need to be solved and , as we will see in the following subsections , highlights several properties of frames .",
    "problem can be separated into @xmath1 convex optimization problems for @xmath55 @xmath56 this optimization problem lies at the heart of the proposed incoherent frame design method . since the solution will lead to vectors that are not of unit norm ( due to the inequality constraint )",
    "a normalization step must always follow .",
    "solving can be done in polynomial time using , for example , optimization strategies like interior point methods @xcite .",
    "notice that for a given frame , the distances between its vectors ( and consequently its mutual coherence ) are preserved under column permutations and orthogonal ( rotational ) transformations . given a frame @xmath52 with gram matrix @xmath57 , if we rotate the frame using an orthonormal transformation @xmath58",
    "i.e. , @xmath59 then the new frame @xmath60 has the same gram matrix since @xmath61 . following this observation notice that we can fix the first vector of a frame to any arbitrary vector ( e.g. , @xmath62 ) since we can always compute a rotation @xmath63 such that the first vector has a predefined , fixed , position .",
    "thus , we can solve problem for @xmath64 .",
    "all these properties will be used to simplify the structure of the proposed algorithm .",
    "we next proceed to study some of the properties of .      in this section",
    "we discuss the choice of the only parameter needed @xmath65 .",
    "since the original equality constraint @xmath66 is not tractable in , we analyze the consequences of the relaxed inequality constraint introduced in , @xmath67 .    in the optimization problem",
    "we define for each vector belonging to the reference frame @xmath52 a trust region , called here @xmath68 , represented by a closed @xmath0-ball centered around the reference vector @xmath47 of fixed radius @xmath48 .",
    "it is in this trust region that we search for a new vector @xmath49 that replaces the reference @xmath47 such that the coherence of the frame is reduced .",
    "the question is how to choose @xmath65 such that we can guarantee that the mutual coherence of the frame is not increased after the normalization of the solution to .",
    "first , notice that the solution to will always be on the hyperspherical cap , denoted here by @xmath69 , of the trust region @xmath68 that is bounded by the tangents to @xmath68 from the origin .",
    "this is true because any solution @xmath70 produces a dot product higher than its projection on @xmath69  a scaled @xmath71 .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that the inequality constraint is satisfied always with equality @xmath72 .",
    "since @xmath73 , the solution @xmath49 is never on the unit @xmath0-sphere and thus a normalization step must follow  this is due to the fact that @xmath74 .",
    "a graphical description of these regions is shown in figure [ fig : choiceoft ] .    , hashed in grey , centered at @xmath75 with fixed radius @xmath76 and the boundary @xmath77 depicted by the bold arc of @xmath78 where all solutions lie in a typical situation generated by @xmath79.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    when there is no change in the direction of the new vector of the frame the solution is @xmath80 .",
    "otherwise , a change @xmath81 in angle from @xmath47 might cause a reduction in coherence with the other vectors of the frame . because the solution belongs to the cap @xmath69 , any deviation @xmath81 from the reference vector leads to a change in the norm of the solution @xmath82 for @xmath83 .",
    "this leads to @xmath84 .",
    "relation follows by the law of cosines in the triangle with vertices in the origin , @xmath47 and any point @xmath49 in the region @xmath69 : @xmath85 .",
    "( the choice of @xmath86 and the convergence of the proposed algorithm ) : * the solution region @xmath69 must not contain any vector collinear with the other vectors @xmath87 . for vector @xmath47",

    "this means that @xmath94 to finalize the new frame vector the normalization step that places the solution @xmath49 on the unit @xmath0sphere follows .",
    "we would like the normalized solution @xmath95 to still be as good as ( or better than ) @xmath47 , that is @xmath96 this inequality is always true since is true and @xmath97 .",
    "intuitively this makes sense since the norm of the solution @xmath49 of increases with the increase in the angle @xmath81 , by .",
    "ultimately , this means that the solution @xmath49 provides a coherence level at least as small as @xmath47 and therefore no increase in coherence can happen .",
    "the proposed algorithm solves problem for each vector of the frame and thus the mutual coherence is monotonically decreasing with each step solving with parameters given by .",

    "( etfs are local minimum points ) : * given an etf , any solution of for @xmath47 that is different from @xmath98 causes an increase in the correlations with the other vectors not only because of the decrease in the angle between at least one of them but also since any deviation @xmath81 from @xmath47 causes a strict increase in .",

    "the initialization . * the initial frame we consider has its entries drawn randomly from a gaussian distribution .",

    "herein , the initial reference frame is @xmath179 .",
    "* the iterations .",
    "* by the argument provided in the previous sections , at each iteration of sidco we solve a sequence of @xmath180 convex optimization problems that produce the vectors of a new frame such that the mutual coherence is decreased .",
    "the frame vectors are chosen in a randomized way so to further avoid the convergence in a local minimum point . before solving the optimization problem",
    ", several choices need to be made .",
    "a discussion of these follows .",
    "first , we change the orientation of the frame vectors such that the current variable vector has positive correlation with all the other fixed vectors .",
    "this allows for both a smaller optimization problem and a simplified analysis of the optimization problem .",
    "we pick the maximum size of the trust region @xmath65 which also guarantees that the mutual coherence of the frame will not increase after solving the optimization problem , as discussed in remark 1 .",
    "we check if the current frame vector @xmath47 can be improved and if so we reduce the dimension of the optimization problem , by the arguments provided in remark 5 and remark 7 , respectively .",
    "we finalize the new vector by a normalization step placing it on the unit @xmath0-sphere .",
    "since remark 5 states that the algorithm does not update a frame vector when it reaches the maximal correlation with a number of @xmath0 other frame vectors , we add a heuristic step to push the current frame from its local minimum if the algorithm has converged too quickly .",
    "we say that the algorithm has converged if in the last 3 iterations the average progress in mutual coherence is less than @xmath181 .",
    "the step applies a polar decomposition as described by theorem 2 of @xcite .",
    "we expect that this update will lead to a relatively small temporary increase in the mutual coherence that will be reduced in the following regular iterations , hopefully to levels lower than the one before the application of this step .",
    "as we will show experimentally , sidco makes significant progress in the reduction of the mutual coherence in a relative small number of iterations ( and thus quickly reaches a local minimum point as shown in remark 1 ) .",
    "therefore , the heuristic step is important in order to allow further progress and push the coherence as low as possible in the maximum of @xmath182 iterations . as discussed in remark 1",
    "the mutual coherence is reduced , or kept at the same level , with every step solving .",
    "clearly , the application of theorem 2 of @xcite breaks the monotonicity and allows for an increase in coherence .",
    "still , in many applications ( for example @xcite ) where incoherent frames are desired there is an underlying assumption that the frame is also tight . in general , gfs are not tight frames .    obviously , solving a sequence of such problems does not guarantee that we reach a maximally incoherent frame ( gf or etf ) but considering that we actually solve a sequence of @xmath103 minimization problems we expect to have many components of the objective function equal in magnitude to the @xmath103 norm of the correlations between the current vector @xmath49 with the others , and thus to be close to such a frame .",
    "an extra advantage of this formulation is that , according to the design needs , it is very easy to add linear equality and convex inequality constraints .",
    "we use this fact in the results section to construct incoherent frames that also satisfy other convex constraints ( like nonnegativity ) .",
    "in this section we show the capabilities of sidco to : provide incoherence frames and sensing matrices for optimized compressed sensing .",
    "finally , we also make a note on the creation of etfs .",
    "given dimensions @xmath38 the first task is to use sidco in order to create frames as incoherent as possible .    tables [ tb : idcon15 ] , [ tb : idcon25 ] and [ tb : idcom120 ] show the design capabilities of sidco for numerous frame dimensions , either for fixed dimension @xmath0 and increasing @xmath1 or vice - versa . in each case , we run sidco with @xmath183 different initializations .",
    "we show the mean mutual coherence of the initial frame , the minimum mutual coherence and the average mutual coherence reached by sidco in the @xmath183 runs . in each run , we compute the average mutual coherence defined as @xmath184 ( not to be confused with the average coherence @xmath185 of @xcite ) . for perspective",

    "as expected , for larger @xmath1 the gap to the bound increases but is still kept in reasonable limits .",
    "furthermore , notice that the mean mutual coherence reached is close to the minimum coherence , showing that the proposed method is not very sensitive to the choice of the initial frame .",

    "the second best approach is idco .",
    "this plot highlights the difference between idco and sidco not just in terms of the final result but also , empirically , in terms of the rate of convergence .",
    "the difference originates in the way the parameters @xmath65 are chosen : heuristically for idco and by remark 1 for sidco .",

    "still , in a situation with no pressing time limit , sidco should run for a number of maximum iterations @xmath182 as large as possible .",
    "finally , figures [ fig : n120 ] and [ fig:40 m ] compare the sidco method with the best competing methods in the literature and show again how it outperforms all of them .",
    "the difference in performance depends on the redundancy of the frames . in figure",
    "[ fig : n120 ] , for highly redundant frames sidco outperforms the other methods by a significant margin ( see @xmath222 ) while otherwise the gap is diminished .",

    "like in the previous section , sidco is better than every other method presented with the performance gap increasing for larger number of measurements .",
    "as others point out @xcite , the performance gain of using incoherent frames as sensing matrices does not scale as much as with the improvement in the mutual coherence .",
    "observe that in figure [ fig : cs1 ] for @xmath248 all results are very close to the random reference  whereas the values of the mutual coherence of the initial , random , frames @xmath179 in tables [ tb : idcon15 ] , [ tb : idcon25 ] , [ tb : idcom120 ] and [ tb : idcon64 ] are very high compared to the mutual coherence achieved by sidco . to see why this might be the case we remind the reader that compressed",
