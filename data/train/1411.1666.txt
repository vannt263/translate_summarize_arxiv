    "the former can be obtained from the real - space coordinates of the individual particles such as colloids @xcite or dusty plasmas @xcite .",
    "computer simulations of classical many - body systems with a prescribed particle pair - interaction potential are a suitable and well - established route to calculate pair correlations @xcite .",
    "there are , however , situations that require a statistical mechanical approach as an alternative to computer simulations . in such cases , there is a choice of various liquid integral equations that are based on the ornstein - zernike equation , and that have often been proven to predict pair correlations accurately and efficiently @xcite .",
    "the large body of complementary experiments , simulations and analytical theory have resulted in a good understanding of pair correlations in the fluid or liquid state by now .",
    "most of the studies so far have focused on the physically most relevant situation of three spatial dimensions ( @xmath3 ) , but liquids can also exist in lower spatial dimensions when they are confined @xcite , _",

    "e.g. _ , the lennard - jones potential @xcite .",

    "analytical @xcite or efficient numerical @xcite methods for the calculation of pair correlations in dimensions @xmath6 are therefore worth aspiring for . in the present study",

    "we find that ( just like in @xmath3 spatial dimensions ) the ry scheme predicts pair - correlations in excellent agreement with the computer simulation results , while the py and hnc scheme show severe over- and under - estimation of the undulations in the static structure factor , respectively .",

    "the thermodynamic equilibrium state of the wca fluid studied here is fully described by two dimensionless parameters : the normalized thermal energy @xmath19 ( with boltzmann constant @xmath20 ) and @xmath21 , which is the number of particles in a @xmath7-dimensional volume @xmath22 . here , @xmath23 is the number density for @xmath24 particles in a hypercubic box of edge length @xmath25 ( taken in the thermodynamic limit @xmath26 and @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is held fixed ) .",
    "note that in the limiting case of vanishing temperature ( @xmath29 or @xmath30 ) , the smoothed wca potential in eq .",
    "reduces to the pair - potential of hard spheres with diameter @xmath18 .",

    "the equilibration runs were followed by production runs of double length , from which the structure factor @xmath41 was computed . during equilibration ,",

    "the ornstein - zernike equation for homogeneous and isotropic , @xmath7-dimensional fluids reads @xmath42 in terms of the @xmath7-dimensional particle number density and the total and direct correlation functions @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively @xcite . to obtain a closed integral equation for a given kind of pair - potential @xmath45",
    ", the ornstein - zernike equation must be supplemented by a closure relation . with the exception of very small number densities , exact closure relations",
    "are unknown in general and one has to resort to approximate closures .",
    "here we study three different approximate closures .",
    "the first two are the py closure @xcite @xmath46 \\times \\left [ e^{-\\beta u(r ) } - 1 \\right]\\ ] ] and the hnc closure @xcite @xmath47 both written in terms of the indirect correlation function @xmath48 and the inverse thermal energy @xmath49 . both the py closure and the hnc closure are thermodynamically inconsistent , in the sense that the predicted normalized inverse isothermal osmotic compressibility computed in the fluctuation route , @xmath50 does not match the corresponding expression @xmath51 from the virial route . here",

    "thermodynamic inconsistency with respect to the isothermal compressibility can be avoided by using the ry closure @xcite @xmath59,\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is a mixing function that depends on the non - negative inverse length @xmath61 .",
    "the ry closure interpolates between the py closure ( which is recovered in both limits @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) , and the hnc closure ( recovered for @xmath64 or @xmath65 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath61 is selected such that equal values are obtained for the isothermal osmotic compressibility calculated in the fluctuation route and the virial route . the standard ry scheme , as used in the present work , is thermodynamically self - consistent with respect to the isothermal osmotic compressibility only . at the expense of an increased numerical effort , the ry scheme can be further improved by requiring consistency in additional , independent thermodynamic quantities @xcite .",
    "note also that the ry scheme usually does not have a solution for non - positive - definite pair potentials .",
    "however , for such potentials different thermodynamically partially self - consistent closure relations have been devised @xcite , similar in spirit to the ry scheme .",
    "the equation of state of four - dimensional wca fluids at various temperatures is investigated in fig .",
    "[ fig : eos ] , where we plot the excess part of the normalized pressure , @xmath66 , as calculated in the ry scheme .",
    "the ( partial ) thermodynamic self consistency of the ry scheme usually results in a significantly improved accuracy of the pair - correlation functions including @xmath67 and the static structure factor @xmath68(q)$ ] , with @xmath69 denoting the @xmath7-dimensional fourier transform of an isotropic function .",
    "however , the good accuracy of the ry scheme is essentially an empirical finding that should be tested by comparison to simulation results , for each pair - potential and each number of spatial dimensions .    in the important , generic case of hard hyperspheres , the ( in this case rather accurate )",
    "py integral equation @xcite can in principle be solved analytically for arbitrary odd dimension @xcite , and semi - analytically for arbitrary even dimension @xcite . however , these solution methods are quite cumbersome , with an analytical effort that rises quickly with increasing number of dimensions @xmath7 . moreover , the py scheme usually over - estimates the undulations in the pair - correlation functions ( in particular in the static structure factor ) , when it is applied to soft repulsive pair - potentials . in case of soft particle interactions ,",
    "like studied in the present work , analytical progress can be made , _",
    "e.g. _ , by resorting to the mean spherical approximation ( msa ) @xcite which represents a closure for the ornstein - zernike equation that results in a linear integral equation .",
    "remedy for the unsatisfactory accuracy of the msa has been proposed in several studies @xcite , in form of semi - analytical rescaling arguments .",
    "a versatile and computationally efficient alternative to the solution of arbitrary - dimensional liquid integral equations is the numerical solution by means of a spectral solver . within this numerical method , employed in the present study , it is easy to implement a variety of different closures for the ornstein - zernike equation , suitable for a variety of particle pair - interaction potentials . in the present work ,",
    "we employ a numerical method that we have comprehensively outlined in ref .",
    "this method , based on techniques that were originally published in refs .",
    "@xcite , is applicable in all positive spatial dimensions @xmath7 and is numerically very efficient and robust .",
    "our implementation of the numerical solution algorithm allows to compute solutions for @xmath70 , the upper boundary for @xmath7 depending on the kind of pair - potentials , the closure relation , and the particle number density .    as a further motivation for studying liquid integral equations in higher dimensions",
    ", we note here that mode - coupling theory ( mct ) has been employed to study the glass transition of hard hyperspheres in very high dimensions @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the structural input to the mct equations was generated by approximating @xmath44 by the mayer function @xmath71 . as outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite , the latter approximation is exact in the limit of infinite spatial dimension ( @xmath72 ) , and remains to be a good approximation of the actual particle pair correlations for dimensions @xmath73 . for dimensions @xmath7 in the range @xmath74 ,",
    "the approximation @xmath75 is insufficient unless the particle number density is very low .",
    "this leads to unphysical artifacts in the predicted glass transition lines for @xmath76 @xcite . as an alternative",
    ", one can use simulation results for the static pair correlations as input to mct @xcite .",
    "however , the computational effort of computer simulations rises quickly as a function @xmath7 , which limits this approach to dimensions @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "hence there is a gap for @xmath77 , where neither simulation results nor infinite - dimensional limiting expressions can be used .",
    "this gap can be essentially filled in by numerical liquid integral equation solutions as reported in the present article and in ref .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : sq_t1_66 ] we plot the static structure factor , @xmath41 , for a four - dimensional wca fluid at a rather high number density @xmath78 , and a rather low temperature , @xmath79 . under these conditions",
    "the fluid exhibits very pronounced pair correlations . shown are the results from our molecular dynamics simulation ( black circles filled in white ) , and from the hnc ( blue dashed curve ) , ry ( red solid curve ) , and py ( green dotted curve ) integral equations .",
    "three insets magnify the regions of very low wave numbers , @xmath80 , the region around the structure factor s principal peak , and the region around the second peak .",
    "note that the hnc scheme predicts a structure factor with considerably underestimated undulations , and that the py scheme is severely over - estimating these undulations , while the ry scheme is in very good ( if not excellent ) agreement with the simulation result .",
    "each of these observations is in - line with the usual observations that have been made for three - dimensional fluids of purely repulsive particles .",
    "the only obvious difference between the md structure factor and the ry structure factor ( and the py and hnc results alike ) is a failure of the liquid integral equation schemes to predict the shape of the second peak in @xmath41 : the right flank of the second peak in the simulation result exhibits a nearly linear decay of @xmath41 for values of @xmath81 between @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "this feature is missing in each of the liquid integral equation scheme results , which predict a rounder shape of the second peak .",
    "similar features in the second peak of the structure factor have been discussed as possible freezing precursors , and as signatures of short - ranged order in the liquid phase @xcite ( see also the related ref .",
    "@xcite ) . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", the second peak shape feature is not observed in any of the usual liquid integral equation schemes that are formulated on the level of pair - correlation functions .",
    "a similar feature ( in the radial distribution function , however , and for @xmath3 ) has been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a computationally more sophisticated integral equation scheme was solved that includes non - trivial triplet correlations .",
    "the implementation of such a scheme for the four - dimensional fluids under investigation is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "note from fig .",
    "[ fig : sq_t2_5_and_7_0 ] , that the agreement between the md simulation and ry - scheme structure factors is very good for higher temperatures ( @xmath84 in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sq_t2_5_and_7_0 ] , and @xmath85 in the right panel ) . for @xmath85",
    ", the flattened second peak feature has practically disappeared in the md simulation results , and the agreement to the ry scheme is almost perfect .",
    "we have demonstrated that the ry integral equation scheme predicts pair correlations in homogeneous four - dimensional fluids of particles with soft repulsive interactions in very good agreement with numerically accurate , but computationally expensive molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "this finding , which is in line with the known excellent performance of the ry scheme for three - dimensional fluids , qualifies the ry scheme as a numerically highly efficient method for calculating the structure input that is needed for theories of dynamics , phase behaviour and vitrification in higher dimensions @xcite . despite its overall very good accuracy , the ry scheme ( as well as the py and hnc schemes ) fails to predict the correct shape of the second peak in the static structure factor when the particle repulsion becomes very strong .",
    "we expect that inclusion of nontrivial triplet correlations into a ( thermodynamically partially self - consistent ) liquid integral equation scheme @xcite for arbitrary spatial dimensions could result in an improved ability of the theory to reproduce the static structure factor , particularly around its second peak .",
