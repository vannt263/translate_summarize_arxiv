    "there are two important phenomena observed in evolutionary dynamical systems of any kind : _ self - organization _ and _ emergence_. both phenomena are the exclusive result of endogenous interactions of the individual elements of an evolutionary dynamical system .",
    "emergence characterizes the patterns that are situated at a higher macro level and that arise from interactions taking place at the lower micro level of the system .",
    "self - organization , besides departing from the individual micro interactions , implies an increase in order of the system , being usually associated to the promotion of a specific functionality and to the generation of patterns .",
    "typically , complex patterns emerge in a system of interacting individuals that participate in a self - organizing process .",
    "self - organization is more frequently related to the process itself , while emergence is usually associated to an outcome of the process .",
    "although less frequently mentioned , the emergence of patterns from self - organizing processes may be strongly dependent on _ locality_. emergence and self - organization are not enough to distinguish between two important and quite different circumstances : the presence of an influence that impacts the system globally and , conversely , the absence of any global influence and the lack of information about any global property of the system . in the latter case ,",
    "the system itself is the exclusive result of local interactions .    such a global influence ( entity or property )",
    "is often associated with the concept of _ environment_. noteworthy , the latter circumstance may be considered a case of the former : when that global entity does not exist , the environment for each agent is just the set of all the other agents .",
    "conversely , when the global entity exists , it is considered part of the environment and may have an inhomogeneous impact on the individual dynamics .",
    "regardless of the environmental type , economical , ecological and social environments share as a common feature the fact that the agents operating in these environments usually try to improve some kind of utility , related either to profit , to food , to reproduction or to comfort and power .",
    "a general concept that is attached to this improvement attempt is the idea of _",
    "adaptation_.    in the economy , adaptation may be concerned with the development of new products to capture a higher market share or with the improvement of the production processes to increase profits : that is , innovation . in ecology ,",
    "adaptation concerns better ways to achieve security or food intake or reproduction chance and , in the social context , some of the above economical and biological drives plus a few other less survival - oriented needs . in all cases",
    ", adaptation aims at finding strategies to better deal with the surrounding environment ( @xcite ) .",
    "natural selection through fitness landscapes or geographic barriers are good examples how global influences are considered when modeling adaptation in an evolutionary process . on the other hand",
    ", adaptation also operates in many structure generating mechanisms that can be found in both physical and social sciences but that are built on the exclusive occurrence of local interactions .    in biology , the ultimate domain of evolution and natural selection , we are confronted with tremendous organic diversity  virtually infinite forms and shapes none of which found twice  but the distribution is well  structured in a way that allows us to order this diversity and to speak of species , families , orders etc .",
    "a quite illustrative description is given by the evolutionary geneticist theodusius dobzhanski ( @xcite : p.21 ) :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ suppose that we make a fairly large collection , say some 10,000 specimens , of birds or butterflies or flowering plants in a small territory , perhaps 100 square kilometers .",
    "no two individuals will be exactly alike .",
    "let us , however , consider the entire collection .",
    "the variations that we find in size , in color , or in other traits among our specimens do not form continuous distributions .",

    "the distributions are separated by gaps , that is , by the absence of specimens with intermediate characteristics .",

    "what we call a species , is in fact some norm or mean characteristics of a cluster of individuals .",
    "evolutionary theory is ultimately a theory about the history which led to such a pattern . and",
    "if the organic diversity we observe nowadays evolved in a way that is characterized by some kind of > > tree of live < < , then there must be events that may lead to the split of a connected set of individuals ( protospecies ) into ( at least ) two sets that are not connected any longer ( see figure [ fig : speciation ] ) . in biology , this is called _ speciation_. as we will see in this article , though , the generation of such a split with simple but well  known evolutionary models in which `` natural selection impels and directs evolutionary changes '' ( ibid .",
    "p.2 ) is not straightforward .",
    "it so happens that constraints on the interaction behavior are required .",
    "the phenotype of living beings is not the only domain where patterns of structured diversity as illustrated in figure [ fig : distribution01 ] are observed .",
    "phenomena include certain phases of structure formation in physical cosmology , distribution of cultural behavior , languages and dialects , herd behavior in finance , among others .    especially for the latter examples in the field of socio - cultural dynamics",
    "a variety of models has been proposed which do not rely on the evolutionary concept of ( natural ) selection .",
    "they are rather based on the idea of exclusively _ local interactions ( li ) _ implemented in form of a system of agents that interact locally according to simple rules like assimilation or conformity . in these systems , finding strategies to better deal with the surrounding environment ( and thus improving fitness ) is not constrained by any global property .",
    "it may , however , be constrained by local ( individual ) rules .",
    "as we shall see later in this paper , constraints on the mechanisms of selection , interaction and replacement and the way they are combined in the modeling of an evolutionary process have an important bearing on both adaptation and emergence of speciation .",
    "locality operating in each of these mechanisms seems to be the fundamental modeling principle by which emergence of a multi - modal distribution as shown in figure [ fig : distribution01 ] can be explained .",
    "on the basis of these observations about the > > modelability < < of speciation with evolutionary and self - organisatory models , we study in this paper the conditions and mechanisms required for speciation and the emergence of a multi - modal distribution .    in this analysis",
    ", we use computational ( section [ sec : computation ] ) as well as mathematical ( section [ sec : mathematic ] ) arguments .",
    "our models simulate how a population of individuals evolves in time in an abstract attribute space @xmath0 that represent phenetic traits , attitudes , verbal behavior , etcetera .",
    "modeling agents as points in an attribute space of this kind is of course a highly artificial abstraction from the complexity and multi  dimensionality of real agents .    for the purposes of this paper ,",
    "let us conceptualize an _ interaction event _ , defining the system evolution from one time step to the other , by the following three components :    1 .",
    "selection of agents , 2 .",
    "application of interaction rules , 3 .",
    "replacement of agents .",
    "any interaction event ( e.g. , mating , communication , ... ) that takes place in the course of a simulation of the model consists of the sequential application of these three steps .",
    "the reason to dissect the interaction events in this way is two  fold :    1 .   we want to look at the dynamical and structural effects of constraints applied to each of the three components independently ; 2 .",
    "the scheduling of interaction events may have a crucial effect on the model behavior , and with the distinction between selection and interaction on the one hand , and replacement on the other , we are able to make this effect explicit .",
    "the way interaction events are scheduled in the implementation of the models is not always given much importance in existing simulation studies .",
    "in the presence of constraints on the selection and interaction mechanisms , however , the outcome as well as the dynamical properties depend in a crucial way on the different choices . on the other hand , there are studies that do analyze the differences between synchronous and asynchronous update ( see , for instance , @xcite ) as well as studies on non  overlapping ( nolg ) and respectively overlapping generations ( olg ) in biology and economics ( for instance , @xcite ) .    here",
    "we show that especially when the interaction is constrained ( as in the case of assortative mating ) there emerges an important qualitative difference between olg and nolg models .",
    "namely , speciation is observed in the former , but not in the latter case , whereas adaptation is favored by the latter and hindered by the former .",
    "however , by the distinction of selection , interaction and replacement we are able to show that in fact the difference between local and non - local replacement plays the determinant role ( and not the distinction between olg and nolg ) . even though locality also impacts selection and interaction mechanisms , it is on the replacement mode where relies the fundamental difference with respect to the conditions required for either adaptiveness or speciation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section 2 addresses the main issues of both the fitness landscape and the self - organizing models from a computer simulation framework . in both cases ,",
    "microscopic implementation rules are tested against their capability of reproducing adaptiveness and speciation . in section 3 ,",
    "the emergence of speciation is analytically shown to be dependent on the choice of different replacement modes .",
    "this is accomplished through a probabilistic description of a minimal model of just three phenetic traits where the transition probabilities between traits follow a markov chain .",
    "section 4 is targeted at presenting concluding remarks and a framework that relates interaction events to the emergence of collective structures in adaptive and self - organizing complex systems .",
    "in biology , and population genetics in particular , adaptive walks on fitness landscapes have been studied intensively .",
    "the main questions addressed by fitness landscapes approaches are related to the possible structure of the landscapes ( e.g. , @xcite ) , to how populations climb an adaptive peak in the landscape ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and to the circumstances under which a population might wander from one peak to another by crossing adaptive valleys ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "one of the best  known models for populations on fitness landscapes is the wright - fisher model with non  overlapping generations ( sometimes called wright - fisher sampling and shortened in the sequel by wf model , see @xcite and also @xcite ) . consider a population of @xmath1 individuals which is said to constitute the original generation ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "we consider only the case of sexual reproduction in this paper , in which the genotype of a new  born individual is obtained by the recombination of the genoms of two randomly chosen parent individuals . as noted above",
    ", the choice of two parents and the application of a recombination rule is referred to as interaction ( or mating ) event . in the wf model , @xmath1",
    "such mating events are performed until a new generation of @xmath1 individuals is complete .",
    "as soon as it is complete , the parent generation is canceled and the process is repeated taking the new generation as parents . therefore , in the wf model the population size is always maintained at @xmath1 .",
    "we will denote the generation number by @xmath3 .",
    "we implemented this simple model and performed simulations on different toy fitness landscapes .",
    "the microscopic rules involved into the creation of a new individual , that is , the mating event , are as follows :    1 .",
    "selection of two individuals with a probability proportional to their fitness , 2 .",
    "application of recombination and mutation rules , 3 .",
    "replacement of an agent from the parent generation .    in this toy model , we consider only one phenetic trait ( locus ) that takes discrete values ( from 0 to 99 ) .",
    "we denote the traits of the two chosen parent individuals @xmath4 and @xmath5 as @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively and model recombination by taking the average of the two , @xmath8 . to model mutations",
    "we add a random value to @xmath9 . in the wf model , @xmath9 is stored at an arbitrary place in the children array and one of the main objectives of this paper is clarify that this has important consequences for the model dynamics .",
    "an adaptive landscape is introduced into the model by assigning a fitness value to each of the 100 traits .",
    "for the first analysis shown in figure [ fig : onepeak.wf ] , a single  peaked fitness function with a peak at trait 75 is used and the fitness assigned to trait @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 we have used the normal distribution with @xmath12 and @xmath13 in the construction of the fitness landscape ( solid line in figure [ fig : onepeak.wf ] ) . in the iteration process , individuals are chosen as parents with a probability proportional to @xmath14 , @xmath10 being the trait of the respective individual .    for the illustrative model realizations in this section , we set @xmath15 .",
    "initially , the 500 individuals are distributed in this space according to a normal distribution with mean @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( see first image of figure [ fig : onepeak.wf ] ) .",
    "this section is mainly thought as an illustration of the different behaviors and patterns generated by certain constraints on the interaction mechanism . as the qualitative effects of different assumptions become evident and comprehensible in single simulations of the model",
    ", there is no need for a rigorous statistical analysis of suites of simulations with varying initial conditions .",
    "moreover , a mathematical analysis of the model dynamics is presented in the second part of this paper ( section [ sec : mathematic ] ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     the framework presented in table 1 schematically shows the consequences of adopting ( un)constrained mechanisms to the emergent outcome of a so process .",
    "it helps to emphasize that the emergence of some specific patterns may be strongly dependent on the way constraints dictate limitations on the selection , interaction and replacement mechanisms .",
    "more specifically , it shows that differently ( un)constraining the replacement mechanism of an so process provides the conditions required for either speciation ( the emergence of multi - modal distributions ) or adaptation , since these features appear as two opposing phenomena , not achieved by one and the same model .    in the same way that random interbreeding leads to conservative dynamics , random",
    "replacement is also an opposing force to speciation since newcomers may take the place of former - distant agents . in so doing , at the macro level , random replacement sets aside the effect of bounded confidence and - like",
    "undirected genetic drift - may lead to the merging of subpopulations .    even though we show in this paper that natural selection",
    ", operating as an external , environmental mechanism , is neither necessary nor sufficient for the creation of clustered populations , we do not want to argue against natural selection as an important mechanism in the biological domain and a substantive driving force in the speciation process .",
    "to the contrary , the concept of ( natural ) selection operating at a global level may provide us with plausible interpretations of the model results , even in disciplines where such interpretations are still lacking .",
    "in the words of t. dobzhanski ( @xcite , p.5 - 6 ) :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ [ ... ] in biology nothing makes sense except in the light of evolution .",
