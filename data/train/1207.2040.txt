    "a common theme , and perhaps necessary condition , for high temperature superconductivity in the iron compounds is the suppression of magnetism , which is accomplished by chemical substitutions or application of pressure .",
    "while aleovalent substitution ( doping ) is most common , replacing some fe with isovalent ru has been shown to produce superconductivity in the family of layered iron arsenides adopting the thcr@xmath5si@xmath5 structure type ( 122 materials ) @xcite . however",
    ", this substitution does not produce superconductivity in 1111 materials , although it does suppress the magnetism @xcite .",
    "indeed , partial replacement of fe with ru in already superconducting compositions ( smfeaso@xmath6f@xmath7 ) decreases the superconducting critical temperature @xcite .",
    "the response to ru substitution is one of the few striking differences between the behavior of 1111 and 122 materials .",
    "the natural extension of these substitution studies is the analysis of the pure ruthenium compounds .",

    "interestingly , the 122 phosphide laru@xmath5p@xmath5 , with trivalent lanthanum in place of the ususal divalent alkaline earth , is superconducting below 4.1 k @xcite .",
    "literature reports for @xmath0ruaso ( @xmath0 = lanthanide ) are limited to lattice constants @xcite and resistivity for @xmath0 = la and ce @xcite .",
    "a more thorough investigation of the ru materials is important in developing a full understanding of the behavior of these interesting chemical systems .",
    "the current study aims to examine the evolution of structural and basic physical properties of some 1111 materials of composition @xmath0ruaso as the lanthanide ( @xmath0 ) is varied .",
    "full crystal structure refinements at room temperature and thermal expansion , heat capacity , electrical transport , and magnetic behavior below 300 k are reported for laruaso , ndruaso , smruaso , and gdruaso .",

    "this reflects the compression of the overall structure when ru is replaced by smaller fe , and is often referred to as chemical pressure .",
    "the fe  as distances in @xmath0feaso vary from 2.412 to 2.392 @xmath30 from @xmath0 = la to gd , showing a much stronger dependence on @xmath0 than the ru  as distances in figure [ fig : bonds ] which vary by less than 0.01 @xmath30 across the same series .",
