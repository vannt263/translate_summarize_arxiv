    "in contrast to existing wireless systems , next - generation mu - mimo will most probably be deployed using base stations ( bs ) that are equipped with a large number of antennas thus increasing the system spectral efficiency . however , achieving this increase in spectral efficiency is conditioned on the availability of precise estimates of the channels between the different users and the bs  @xcite .",
    "csi is typically obtained by sending reference signals ( rs ) , also called pilots , which are known at both transmitter and receiver sides .",
    "the portion of time and frequency resources reserved to these training sequences is what constitutes the channel training overhead . in an uplink scenario where multiple users are simultaneously transmitting to the bs",
    ", the channel training overhead typically grows with the number of these users .",
    "this also applies to downlink user - specific pilots transmitted by the bs .",
    "there is thus a crucial need to compensate this increase in overhead .",
    "whether in the uplink or in the downlink , special care should be paid so that the pilot signals of users scheduled at the same time - frequency resources are ( at least partially ) orthogonal to each other and that the symbol positions used by one of them for pilot transmission are not used by another for data transmission to avoid data - pilot interference .",
    "the issue of reducing channel training overhead in mu - mimo was addressed in @xcite and @xcite where the authors propose to exploit the spatial correlation of users channels to the bs antenna array in order to minimize the length of their training sequences .",
    "the proposed schemes rely on the fact that users pilot signals can be separated to some extent at the bs through their spatial signature , provided that their low - rank channel covariance matrices are known .",
    "another promising approach to reduce channel training overhead without the additional overhead needed for spatial covariance estimation consists in reducing the _ average _ density of pilot symbols .",
    "indeed , in wireless systems that use orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( ofdm ) , channel training is done by sending pilots on some predefined positions , i.e. according to a predefined _ pilot pattern _ , in the time - frequency resource grid .",
    "once an estimate of the channel at the pilot positions is available , interpolation techniques are used to exploit correlation in time and frequency , and obtain the estimate of the channel on the grid positions carrying data . in principle , the required density of pilot symbols in a pilot pattern is related to the level of correlation of the channel coefficients along the time and the frequency axes . for instance , for users with a fast changing channel , density along the time axis must be increased with respect to ( w.r.t . )",
    "almost - static users . on the other hand , a higher frequency selectivity requires denser pilots along the frequency axis . adapting the pilot patterns to users second - order statistics makes it possible to send / receive training sequences with different pilot symbol densities : some of these can be lower than the highest pilot density designed to cope with the worst - case channel . in @xcite ,",
    "methods for choosing the pilot pattern for ofdm based on the channel time and frequency correlation properties are proposed . a method for selecting mimo ofdm pilot patterns based on the channel signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) ,",
    "maximum doppler frequency and root mean square delay spread is proposed in  @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "adaptive pilot patterns are proposed but the adaptation is done only w.r.t .",
    "users quality - of - service ( qos ) requirements .",
    "a method to assign ofdma pilot patterns on the basis of groups of mobile users having the same speed is proposed in @xcite . however , in this method groups with different pilot patterns are forced to occupy disjoint time intervals .",
    "all these works do not address the more challenging issue of pilot pattern adaptation for mu - mimo systems where the pilot symbols of different users could overlap due to spatial multiplexing .",
    "we propose a pilot pattern adaptation scheme that can lower pilot and signaling overhead for both uplink and downlink user - specific training sequences in mu - mimo systems .",
    "the scheme consists in constraining the scheduler to group users based on their channels second - order statistics .",
    "therefore , patterns with a reduced overhead can be used on a rb in which all scheduled users have milder requirements on pilots .",
    "even though the scheme constrains the scheduler with the grouping step , we prove that the average spectral efficiency achieved with the proposed scheme is guaranteed to be larger than that of conventional pilot selection combined with any user scheduling paradigm , provided that the number of bs antennas and of cell users is large enough .",
    "finally , we show through simulations that this property is valid even with practical values of the number of bs antennas and of cell users .",
    "we consider an ofdm - based mu - mimo single - cell system where the bs is equipped with @xmath0 antennas and assume that the ofdm resource grid is divided into @xmath1 rbs , each composed of @xmath2 ofdm symbols , each comprising @xmath3 subcarriers ( scs ) , resulting in a total of @xmath4 resource elements ( res ) per rb .",
    "we denote the set of ( single - antenna ) terminals asking to be served as @xmath5 and define @xmath6 .",

    "the set of users whose channels follows the @xmath57-th model are denoted as @xmath58 , where @xmath59 as in  @xcite , we assume that one can get small - enough channel estimate mean - square error ( mse ) by restricting @xmath16 and @xmath17 to be composed of regularly spaced positions with a pilot symbol density two - times the density dictated by the _ sampling theorem for band limited wss random processes_. this rule of thumb implies that the _ maximum _ pilot symbol spacing that can be used on a channel  @xmath57 is @xmath60 ofdm symbols in the time domain and @xmath61 scs in the frequency domain , where @xmath62 here , @xmath63 denotes the duration of the ofdm symbol and @xmath64 the inter - subcarrier frequency separation .",

    "we defined @xmath85 and @xmath86 the associated maximum spectral efficiency is given by @xmath87 solving involves high csi acquisition overhead needed to have csi at the bs about each user s channel on all the rbs .",
    "many of the existing user scheduling paradigms try to find the rb allocation that solves ( exactly or approximately ) .",
    "finding such rb allocation is out of the scope of this work .",
    "however , we evaluate how the proposed pilot allocation and grouping affect the maximum spectral efficiency of the system .    for the sake of notational simplicity",
    ", we drop from now on the use of superscripts @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "for instance , the notations @xmath44 and @xmath10 are merged into @xmath77 while @xmath65 and @xmath65 are replaced with @xmath90 . whenever needed , the transmission scenario , whether downlink or uplink , will be explicitly mentioned .",
    "using the pilot patterns of section  [ sec : conventional ] for user - specific rs in 5 g systems would be very inefficient . indeed , in these systems :",
    "@xmath91 ) users channel conditions in one cell can be very diverse due to their larger numbers , and @xmath92 ) longer pilot sequences are needed because more users are spatially multiplexed .",
    "for example , a mu - mimo transmission to 8 users would require 48 pilot symbols per rb as opposed to 24 in the case of 4 multiplexed users .",
    "we thus propose an _ adaptive _ pilot pattern selection that is based on the following guidelines .",
    "let @xmath93 designate the predefined set of possible values of @xmath94 and assume that any @xmath95 has a regular pilot symbol spacing denoted as @xmath96 which satisfies @xmath97 the constraint in means that for two pilot patterns to be considered as distinct they should have different pilot symbol spacing values , either on the time axis or on the frequency axis or on both .",
    "it is also natural to bound the number of possible pilot patterns with the number @xmath98 of distinct statistical channel conditions : @xmath99 this paper focuses on the practical case where channel spatial covariance matrices are not known at the bs and where , consequently , the training sequence shortening techniques of @xcite or  @xcite do not apply .",
    "we thus impose that , @xmath100 figure  [ fig : dl_pattern_example ] shows @xmath101 pilot patterns which satisfy conditions  for a system with @xmath102 and @xmath72 .        in the following ,",
    "we assume that such patterns can be used for both uplink and downlink pilot transmissions .",
    "we use the term _ pilot pattern adaptation _ to designate any mapping @xmath78 from @xmath103 to @xmath104 where @xmath104 satisfies conditions , and .",
    "any such mapping assigns to each rb  @xmath7 used by a set @xmath77 of users a set of pilot positions @xmath105 indicated as @xmath78 .",
    "in other words , pilot pattern adaptation is performed on a per - rb basis so that all users scheduled in the same rb have the same pilot pattern , thus avoiding interference between data and pilot symbols",
    ". moreover , the pilot pattern on any rb should accommodate the user with the worst - case statistical channel conditions scheduled in that rb , i.e. @xmath106 , @xmath107 finally , scheduling should take into account users pilot density requirements , which implies the need for an additional process that identifies the groups @xmath108 ,  , @xmath109 and which interacts with the scheduling process ,",
    "i.e. @xmath110    we propose a method that performs both pilot pattern adaptation and user scheduling following the guidelines in .    in order to perform pilot pattern adaptation and user scheduling following the guidelines in  it is necessary that the values of @xmath111 and @xmath112 for @xmath113 are available at the bs .",
    "interestingly , acquiring these values can be achieved without additional overhead . indeed ,",
    "variation over time of the maximum doppler frequency shift and the maximum delay spread of a channel is typically much slower than the variations of the channel coefficients .",
    "these parameters can thus be estimated based on previous uplink pilot transmissions .",
    "the proposed scheme consists in first pre - assigning the rbs to the groups @xmath108,  ,@xmath109 using a mapping @xmath114 .",
    "this mapping could be the outcome of optimizing rb allocation to the pilot pattern groups based on average per - rb channel quality indicators .",
    "otherwise , @xmath115 could be a _ fixed _ pre - assignment of rbs .",
    "one example of such mapping is the one adopted in algorithm  [ algo : grouping ] and which satisfies @xmath116 , @xmath117 to guarantee fairness among the different groups .",
    "once this pre - assignment is done , the per - rb pilot pattern adaptation consists in choosing the pilot pattern @xmath118 that has the largest pilot inter symbol distances @xmath119 and @xmath120 satisfying the condition in .",
    "then , the scheduler chooses @xmath121 .",
    "@xmath122 @xmath123    the asymptotic results given below are valid for _ arbitrary _ @xmath77 including those obtained by applying state - of - the - art scheduling paradigms to @xmath124 and those obtained by random selection of @xmath77 from within @xmath124 .    because of the grouping step and the possibility of arbitrarily choosing @xmath121 , algorithm  [ algo : grouping ] is much less demanding in both computational complexity and csi acquisition overhead than any conventional scheme that tries to solve .",
    "furthermore , we show that algorithm  [ algo : grouping ] outperforms any conventional scheme that uses fixed pilot pattern assignment , at least for large - enough numbers of users and bs antennas . as for the signaling overhead needed to inform a user of the selected pilot pattern ,",
    "it is of the order of @xmath125 which is typically very small , e.g. only 2 bits are needed when @xmath126 .",
    "we focus on the case where perfect csi is available at the bs and where the combining coefficients @xmath42 are chosen based on the mrc criterion and the precoding coefficients @xmath46 based on the mrt criterion . in this case , let @xmath127 be the spectral efficiency achieved by algorithm  [ algo : grouping ] , where @xmath128 is given by   and where @xmath129 stands for ` grouping ' .",
